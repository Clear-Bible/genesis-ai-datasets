      to

The Pastor of Hermas
     __________________________________________________________________

   [Translated by the Rev. F. Crombie, M.a.]

   [a.d. 160.] The fragment known as the "Muratorian Canon" is the
   historic ground for the date I give to this author. [1] I desired to
   prefix The Shepherd to the writings of Irenæus, but the limits of the
   volume would not permit. The Shepherd attracted my attention, even in
   early youth, as a specimen of primitive romance; but of course it
   disappointed me, and excited repugnance. As to its form, it is even now
   distasteful. But more and more, as I have studied it, and cleared up
   the difficulties which surround it, and the questions it has started,
   it has become to me a most interesting and suggestive relic of the
   primitive age. Dr. Bunsen [2] calls it "a good but dull novel," and
   reminds us of a saying of Niebuhr (Bunsen's master), that "he pitied
   the Athenian [3] Christians for being obliged to hear it read in their
   assemblies." A very natural, but a truly superficial, thought, as I
   trust I shall be able to show.

   At first sight, Hermas might seem to have little in common with
   Irenæus; and, on many accounts, it would be preferable to pair him with
   Barnabas. But I feel sure that chronology forbids, and that the age of
   Irenæus, and of the martyrs of Lyons and Vienne, is the period which
   called for this work, and which accounts for its popularity and its
   diffusion among the churches. Its pacific spirit in dealing with a
   rising heresy, which at first was a puzzle to the Latins, [4] which
   Pius was disposed to meet by this gentle antidote, with which
   Eleutherus, in the spirit of a pacificator, tampered to his own hurt,
   and by which Victor was temporarily compromised, met precisely what the
   case seemed to demand in the judgment of Western Christians. They could
   not foresee the results of Montanism: it was not yet a defined heresy.
   And even the wise prudence of Irenæus shows anxiety not too hastily to
   denounce it; "seeing," as Eusebius affirms, "there were many other
   wonderful powers of divine grace yet exhibited, even at that time, in
   different churches."

   Bunsen pronounces magisterially on the Muratorian fragment as an
   ill-translated excerpt from Hegesippus, written about a.d. 165. This
   date may be inaccurate, but the evidence is that of a contemporary on
   which we may rely. "Very recently," he says, "in our own times, in the
   city of Rome, Hermas compiled The Shepherd; his brother, Bishop Pius,
   [5] then sitting in the cathedra of the Roman Church." With the period
   thus assigned, the internal evidence agrees. It accounts for the
   anti-Montanism of the whole allegory, and not less for the choice of
   this non-controversial form of antidote. Montanism is not named; but it
   is opposed by a reminder of better "prophesyings," and by setting the
   pure spirit of the apostolic age over against the frenzied and
   pharisaical pretensions of the fanatics. The pacific policy at first
   adopted by the Roman bishops, dictated, no doubt, this effort of Hermas
   to produce such a refutation as his brother [6] might commend to the
   churches.

   Let me present, in outline, the views which seem to me necessary to a
   good understanding of the work; and as I am so unfortunate as to differ
   with the Edinburgh editors, who are entitled, primâ facie, to be
   supposed correct, I shall venture to apologize for my own conceptions,
   by a few notes and elucidations. [7]

   As Eusebius informs us, the charismata were not extinct in the churches
   when the Phrygian imitations began to puzzle the faithful. Bunsen
   considers its first propagators specimens of the clairvoyant art, and
   pointedly cites the manipulations they were said to practice (like
   persons playing on the harp), in proof of this. We must place ourselves
   in those times to comprehend the difficulties of early Christians in
   dealing with the counterfeit. "Try the spirits," said St. John; and St.
   Paul had said more expressly, "Quench not the Spirit; despise not
   prophesyings; prove all things," etc. This very expression suggests
   that there might often be something despicable in the form and manner
   of uttering what was excellent. To borrow a phrase of our days, "the
   human element" was painfully predominant at times, even among those who
   spoke by the Spirit. The smoke of personal infirmity discoloured
   genuine scintillations from hearts in which still smouldered the fire
   of Pentecostal gifts. The reticence of Irenæus is therefore not to be
   marvelled at. He cautioned Eleutherus no doubt, but probably felt, with
   him, that the rumours from Phrygia needed further examination. The
   prophetic gifts were said to be lodged in men and women austere as John
   the Baptist, and professing a mission to rebuke the carnal and
   self-indulgent degeneracy of a generation that knew not the apostles.

   It would not be a very bold conjecture, that Hermas and his brother
   were elderly grandchildren of the original Hermas, the friend of St.
   Paul. The Shepherd, then, might be based upon personal recollections,
   and upon the traditions of a family which the spirit of prophecy had
   reproved, and who were monuments of its power. The book supplies us
   with evidences of the awakened conscience with which Hermas strove to
   "bless his household." But, be this as it may, this second Hermas, with
   his brother's approbation, undertakes to revive the memory of those
   primal days portrayed in the Epistle to Diognetus, when Christians,
   though sorrowful, were "always rejoicing." He compiles accordingly a
   non-metrical idyl; reproducing, no doubt, traditional specimens of
   those "prophesyings," on which St. Paul remarks. Hence we infer, that
   such outpourings as became the subject of apostolic censure, when they
   confused the order of the Corinthian Church, [8] were, in their nobler
   examples, such "visions," "mandates" and "similitudes" as these; more
   or less human as to form, but, in their moral teachings, an impressive
   testimony against heathen oracles, and their obscene or blasphemous
   suggestions.

   The permissive wisdom of the Spirit granting, while restraining, such
   manifestations, is seen in thus counterbalancing Sibylline and other
   ethnic utterances. (Acts xvi. 16-19.) With this in view, Hermas makes
   his compilation. He casts it into an innocent fiction, as Cowper wrote
   in the name of Alexander Selkirk, and introduces Hermas and Clement to
   identify the times which are idealized in his allegory. Very gently,
   but forcibly, therefore, he brings back the original Christians as
   antagonists of the Montanistic opinions; and so exclusively does this
   idea predominate in the whole work, as Tertullian's scornful comment
   implies, that one wonders to find Wake, with other very learned men,
   conceding that the Pauline Hermas was its actual author. Were it so, he
   must have been a prophet indeed. No doubt those of the ancients who
   knew nothing of the origin of the work, and accepted it as the
   production of the first Hermas, were greatly influenced by this idea.
   It seemed to them a true oracle from God, like those of the Apocalypse,
   though sadly inferior; preparing the Church for one of its great trials
   and perils, and fulfilling, as did the Revelation of St. John, that
   emphatic promise concerning the Spirit, "He shall show you things to
   come."

   This view of the subject, moreover, explains historical facts which
   have been so unaccountable to many critics; such as the general credit
   it obtained, and that its influence was greater in the East than among
   Latins. But once commended to the Asiatic churches by Pius, as a useful
   instruction for the people, and a safeguard against the Phrygian
   excesses, it would easily become current wherever the Greek language
   prevailed. Very soon it would be popularly regarded as the work of the
   Pauline Hermas, and as embodying genuine prophesyings of the apostolic
   age. A qualified inspiration would thus be attributed to them,
   precisely such as the guarded language of Origen [9] suggested
   afterwards: hence the deutero-canonical repute of the book, read, like
   the Apocrypha, for instruction and edification, but not cited to
   establish any doctrine as of the faith. [10] It must be remembered,
   that, although the Roman Church was at first a Grecian colony, and
   largely composed of those Hellenistic Jews to whom St. Paul's arguments
   in his Epistle to the Romans were personally appropriate, yet in the
   West, generally, it was not so: hence the greater diffusion of The
   Shepherd written in Greek, through the Greek churches. There, too, the
   Montanists were a raging pestilence long before the West really felt
   the contagion through the influence of the brilliant Tertullian. These
   facts account for the history of the book, its early currency and
   credit in the Church. Nor must we fail to observe, that the tedious
   allegorizing of Hermas, though not acceptable to us, was by no means
   displeasing to Orientals. To this day, the common people, even with us,
   seem to be greatly taken with story-telling and "similitudes,"
   especially when there is an interpreter to give them point and
   application.

   After reading Irenæus Against Heresies, then, we may not
   inappropriately turn to this mild protest against the most desolating
   and lasting delusion of primitive times. Most bitterly this will be
   felt when we reach the great founder of "Latin Christianity," whose
   very ashes breathed contagion into the life of such as handled his
   relics with affection, save only those, who, like Cyprian, were gifted
   with a character as strong as his own. The genius of Tertullian
   inspired his very insanity with power, and, to the discipline of the
   Latin churches, he communicated something of the rigour of Montanism,
   with the natural re-actionary relaxation of morals in actual life. Of
   this, we shall learn enough when we come to read the fascinating pages
   of that splendid but infatuated author. Montanism itself, and the
   Encratite heresy which we are soon to consider in the melancholy case
   of Tatian, were re-actions from those abominations of the heathen with
   which Christians were daily forced to be conversant. These Fathers
   erred through a temptation in which Satan was "transformed as an angel
   of light." Let us the more admire the penetrating foresight, and the
   holy moderation, of Hermas. To our scornful age, indeed, glutted with
   reading of every sort, and alike over-cultivated and superficial,
   taking little time for thought, and almost as little for study, The
   Shepherd can furnish nothing attractive. He who brings nothing to it,
   gets nothing from it. But let the fastidious who desire at the same
   time to be competent judges, put themselves into the times of the
   Antonines, and make themselves, for the moment, Christians of that
   period, and they will awaken to a new world of thought. Let such go
   into the assemblies of the primitive faithful, in which it was evident
   that "not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many
   noble, were called." There they were, "as sheep appointed to be slain,"
   "dying daily," and, like their blessed Master, "the scorn of men, and
   outcast of the people," as they gathered on the day of the Lord to "eat
   of that bread, and drink of that cup." After the manner of the
   synagogue, there came a moment when the "president" said, "Brethren, if
   ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on." But the
   tongues were ceasing, as the apostle foretold; and they who professed
   to speak by the Spirit were beginning to be doubted. "Your fathers,
   where are they? and the prophets, do they live forever?" It was
   gratifying to the older men, and excited the curiosity of the young,
   when the reader stood up, and said, "Hear, then, the words of Hermas."
   Blessed were the simple folk, those "lambs among wolves," who hungered
   and thirsted after righteousness, and who eagerly drank in the pure and
   searching Scriptural morality of The Shepherd, and then went forth to
   "shine as lights in the world," in holy contrast with the gross
   darkness that surrounded them.

   It has been objected, indeed, that the morals of Hermas have a
   legalizing tone. The same is said of St. James, and the Sermon on the
   Mount. Most unjustly and cruelly is this objection made to The
   Shepherd. Granted its language is not formulated after Augustine, as it
   could not be: its text is St. James, but, like St. James, harmonized
   always with St. Paul. [11] Faith is always honoured in its primary
   place; and penitence, in its every evangelical aspect, is thoroughly
   defined. He exposes the emptiness of formal works, such as mere
   physical fastings, and the carnal observance of set times and days.
   That in one instance he favours "works of supererogation" is an entire
   mistake, made by reading into the words of Hermas a heresy of which he
   never dreamed. His whole teaching conflicts with such a thought. His
   orthodoxy in other respects, is sustained by such masters as Pearson
   and Bull. [12] And then, the positive side of his teaching is a
   precious testimony to the godly living exacted of believers in the
   second century. How suitable to all times are the maxims he extracts
   from the New Law. How searching his exposure of the perils of lax
   family discipline, and of wealth unsanctified. What heavenly precepts
   of life he lays down for all estates of men. To the clergy, what rules
   he prescribes against ambition and detraction and worldly-mindedness.
   Surely such reproofs glorify the epoch, when they who had cast off, so
   recently, the lusts and passions of heathenism, were, as the general
   acceptance of this book must lead us to suppose, eager to be fed with
   "truth, severe in rugged fiction drest."

   But the reader will now be eager to examine the following Introductory
   Notice of the translator:--

   The Pastor of Hermas was one of the most popular books, if not the most
   popular book, in the Christian Church during the second, third, and
   fourth centuries. It occupied a position analogous in some respects to
   that of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress in modern times; and critics have
   frequently compared the two works.

   In ancient times two opinions prevailed in regard to the authorship.
   The most widely spread was, that the Pastor of Hermas was the
   production of the Hermas mentioned in the Epistle to the Romans. Origen
   [13] states this opinion distinctly, and it is repeated by Eusebius
   [14] and Jerome. [15]

   Those who believed the apostolic Hermas to be the author, necessarily
   esteemed the book very highly; and there was much discussion as to
   whether it was inspired or not. The early writers are of opinion that
   it was really inspired. Irenæus quotes it as Scripture; [16] Clemens
   Alexandrinus speaks of it as making its statements "divinely;" [17] and
   Origen, though a few of his expressions are regarded by some as
   implying doubt, unquestionably gives it as his opinion that it is
   "divinely inspired." [18] Eusebius mentions that difference of opinion
   prevailed in his day as to the inspiration of the book, some opposing
   its claims, and others maintaining its divine origin, especially
   because it formed an admirable introduction to the Christian faith. For
   this latter reason it was read publicly, he tells us, in the churches.

   The only voice of antiquity decidedly opposed to the claim is that of
   Tertullian. He designates it apocryphal, [19] and rejects it with
   scorn, as favouring anti-Montanistic opinions. Even his words, however,
   show that it was regarded in many churches as Scripture.

   The second opinion as to the authorship is found in no writer of any
   name. It occurs only in two places: a poem falsely ascribed to
   Tertullian, and a fragment published by Muratori, on the Canon, the
   authorship of which is unknown, and the original language of which is
   still a matter of dispute. [20] The fragment says, "The Pastor was
   written very lately in our times, in the city of Rome, by Hermas, while
   Bishop Pius, his brother, sat in the chair of the Church of the city of
   Rome."

   A third opinion has had advocates in modern times. The Pastor of Hermas
   is regarded as a fiction, and the person Hermas, who is the principal
   character, is, according to this opinion, merely the invention of the
   fiction-writer.

   Whatever opinion critics may have in regard to the authorship, there
   can be but one opinion as to the date. The Pastor of Hermas must have
   been written at an early period. The fact that it was recognised by
   Irenæus as Scripture shows that it must have been in circulation long
   before his time. The most probable date assigned to its composition is
   the reign of Hadrian, or of Antoninus Pius.

   The work is very important in many respects; but especially as
   reflecting the tone and style of books which interested and instructed
   the Christians of the second and third centuries.

   The Pastor of Hermas was written in Greek. It was well known in the
   Eastern Churches: it seems to have been but little read in the Western.
   Yet the work bears traces of having been written in Italy.

   For a long time the Pastor of Hermas was known to scholars only in a
   Latin version, occurring in several mss. with but slight vacations. But
   within recent times the difficulty of settling the text has been
   increased by the discovery of various mss. A Latin translation has been
   edited, widely differing from the common version. Then a Greek ms. was
   said to have been found in Mount Athos, of which Simonides affirmed
   that he brought away a portion of the original and a copy of the rest.
   Then a ms. of the Pastor of Hermas was found at the end of the Sinaitic
   Codex of Tischendorf. And in addition to all these, there is an
   Æthiopic translation. The discussion of the value of these discoveries
   is one of the most difficult that can fall to the lot of critics; for
   it involves not merely an examination of peculiar forms of words and
   similar criteria, but an investigation into statements made by
   Simonides and Tischendorf respecting events in their own lives. But
   whatever may be the conclusions at which the critic arrives, the
   general reader does not gain or lose much. In all the Greek and Latin
   forms the Pastor of Hermas is substantially the same. There are many
   minute differences; but there are scarcely any of importance,--perhaps
   we should say none.

   In this translation the text of Hilgenfeld, which is based on the
   Sinaitic Codex, has been followed.

   The letters Vat. mean the Vatican manuscript, the one from which the
   common or Vulgate version was usually printed.

   The letters Pal. mean the Palatine manuscript edited by Dressel, which
   contains the Latin version, differing considerably from the common
   version.

   The letters Lips. refer to the Leipzig manuscript, partly original and
   partly copied, furnished by Simonides from Athos. The text of Anger and
   Dindorf (Lips., 1856) has been used, though reference has also been
   made to the text of Tischendorf in Dressel.

   The letters Sin. refer to the Sinaitic Codex, as given in Dressel and
   in Hilgenfeld's notes.

   The letters Æth. refer to the Æthiopic version, edited, with a Latin
   translation, by Antonius D'Abbadie. Leipzig, 1860.

   No attempt has been made to give even a tithe of the various readings.
   Only the most important have been noted.

   [It is but just to direct the reader's attention to an elaborate
   article of Dr. Donaldson, in the (London) Theological Review, vol. xiv.
   p. 564; in which he very ingeniously supports his opinions with regard
   to Hermas, and also touching the Muratorian Canon. In one important
   particular he favours my own impression; viz., that The Shepherd is a
   compilation, traditional, or reproduced from memory. He supposes its
   sentiments "must have been expressed in innumerable oral communications
   delivered in the churches throughout the world."]

      Against Filthy and Proud Thoughts, and the Carelessness of Hermas in
      Chastising His Sons.

      Chap. I.

   He who had brought me up, sold me to one Rhode in Rome. [21] Many years
   after this I recognised her, and I began to love her as a sister. Some
   time after, I saw her bathe in the river Tiber; and I gave her my hand,
   and drew her out of the river. The sight of her beauty made me think
   with myself, "I should be a happy man if I could but get a wife as
   handsome and good as she is." This was the only thought that passed
   through me: this and nothing more. A short time after this, as I was
   walking on my road to the villages, [22] and magnifying the creatures
   of God, and thinking how magnificent, and beautiful, and powerful they
   are, [23] I fell asleep. And the Spirit carried me away, and took me
   through a pathless place, [24] through which a man could not travel,
   for it was situated in the midst of rocks; it was rugged and impassible
   on account of water. Having passed over this river, I came to a plain.
   I then bent down on my knees, and began to pray to the Lord, [25] and
   to confess my sins. And as I prayed, the heavens were opened, and I see
   the woman whom I had desired saluting me from the sky, and saying,
   "Hail, Hermas!" And looking up to her, I said, "Lady, what doest thou
   here?" And she answered me, "I have been taken up here to accuse you of
   your sins before the Lord." "Lady," said I, "are you to be the subject
   of my accusation?" [26] "No," said she; "but hear the words which I am
   going to speak to you. God, who dwells in the heavens, and made out of
   nothing the things that exist, and multiplied and increased them on
   account of His holy Church, [27] is angry with you for having sinned
   against me." I answered her, "Lady, have I sinned against you? How?
   [28] or when spoke I an unseemly word to you? Did I not always think of
   you as a lady? Did I not always respect you as a sister? Why do you
   falsely accuse me of this wickedness and impurity?" With a smile she
   replied to me, "The desire of wickedness [29] arose within your heart.
   Is it not your opinion that a righteous man commits sin when an evil
   desire arises in his heart? There is sin in such a case, and the sin is
   great," said she; "for the thoughts of a righteous man should be
   righteous. For by thinking righteously his character is established in
   the heavens, [30] and he has the Lord merciful to him in every
   business. But such as entertain wicked thoughts in their minds are
   bringing upon themselves death and captivity; and especially is this
   the case with those who set their affections on this world, [31] and
   glory in their riches, and look not forward to the blessings of the
   life to come. For many will their regrets be; for they have no hope,
   but have despaired of themselves and their life. [32] But do thou pray
   to God, and He will heal thy sins, and the sins of thy whole house, and
   of all the saints." [33]

      Chap. II.

   After she had spoken these words, the heavens were shut. I was
   overwhelmed with sorrow and fear, and said to myself, "If this sin is
   assigned to me, how can I be saved, or how shall I propitiate God in
   regard to my sins, [34] which are of the grossest character? With what
   words shall I ask the Lord to be merciful to me?" While I was thinking
   over these things, and discussing them in my mind, I saw opposite to me
   a chair, white, made of white wool, [35] of great size. And there came
   up an old woman, arrayed in a splendid robe, and with a book in her
   hand; and she sat down alone, and saluted me, "Hail, Hermas!" And in
   sadness and tears [36] I said to her, "Lady, hail!" And she said to me,
   "Why are you downcast, Hermas? for you were wont to be patient and
   temperate, and always smiling. Why are you so gloomy, and not
   cheerful?" I answered her and said, "O Lady, I have been reproached by
   a very good woman, who says that I sinned against her." And she said,
   "Far be such a deed from a servant of God. But perhaps a desire after
   her has arisen within your heart. Such a wish, in the case of the
   servants of God, produces sin. For it is a wicked and horrible wish in
   an all-chaste and already well-tried spirit [37] to desire an evil
   deed; and especially for Hermas so to do, who keeps himself from all
   wicked desire, and is full of all simplicity, and of great
   guilelessness."

      Chap. III.

   "But God is not angry with you on account of this, but that you may
   convert your house, [38] which have committed iniquity against the
   Lord, and against you, their parents. And although you love your sons,
   yet did you not warn your house, but permitted them to be terribly
   corrupted. [39] On this account is the Lord angry with you, but He will
   heal all the evils which have been done in your house. For, on account
   of their sins and iniquities, you have been destroyed by the affairs of
   this world. But now the mercy of the Lord [40] has taken pity on you
   and your house, and will strengthen you, and establish you in his
   glory. [41] Only be not easy-minded, [42] but be of good courage and
   comfort your house. For as a smith hammers out his work, and
   accomplishes whatever he wishes [43] , so shall righteous daily speech
   overcome all iniquity. [44] Cease not therefore to admonish your sons;
   for I know that, if they will repent with all their heart, they will be
   enrolled in the Books of Life with the saints." [45] Having ended these
   words, she said to me, "Do you wish to hear me read?" I say to her,
   "Lady, I do." "Listen then, and give ear to the glories of God." [46]
   And then I heard from her, magnificently and admirably, things which my
   memory could not retain. For all the words were terrible, such as man
   could not endure. [47] The last words, however, I did remember; for
   they were useful to us, and gentle. [48] "Lo, the God of powers, who by
   His invisible strong power and great wisdom has created the world, and
   by His glorious counsel has surrounded His creation with beauty, and by
   His strong word has fixed the heavens and laid the foundations of the
   earth upon the waters, and by His own wisdom and providence [49] has
   created His holy [50] Church, which He has blessed, lo! He removes [51]
   the heavens and the mountains, [52] the hills and the seas, and all
   things become plain to His elect, that He may bestow on them the
   blessing which He has promised them, [53] with much glory and joy, if
   only they shall keep the commandments of God which they have received
   in great faith."

      Chap. IV.

   When she had ended her reading, she rose from the chair, and four young
   men came and carried off the chair and went away to the east. And she
   called me to herself and touched my breast, and said to me, "Have you
   been pleased with my reading?" And I say to her, "Lady, the last words
   please me, but the first are cruel and harsh." Then she said to me,
   "The last are for the righteous: the first are for heathens and
   apostates." And while she spoke to me, two men appeared and raised her
   on their shoulders, and they went to where the chair was in the east.
   With joyful countenance did she depart; and as she went, she said to
   me, "Behave like a man, [54] Hermas."

    Vision Second.

      Again, of His Neglect in Chastising His Talkative Wife and His Lustful
      Sons, and of His Character.

      Chap. I.

   As I was going to the country [55] about the same time as on the
   previous year, in my walk I recalled to memory the vision of that year.
   And again the Spirit carried me away, and took me to the same place
   where I had been the year before. [56] On coming to that place, I bowed
   my knees and began to pray to the Lord, and to glorify His name,
   because He had deemed me worthy, and had made known to me my former
   sins. On rising from prayer, I see opposite me that old woman, whom I
   had seen the year before, walking and reading some book. And she says
   to me, "Can you carry a report of these things to the elect of God?" I
   say to her, "Lady, so much I cannot retain in my memory, but give me
   the book and I shall transcribe it." "Take it," says she, "and you will
   give it back to me." Thereupon I took it, and going away into a certain
   part of the country, I transcribed the whole of it letter by letter;
   [57] but the syllables of it I did not catch. No sooner, however, had I
   finished the writing of the book, than all of a sudden it was snatched
   from my hands; but who the person was that snatched it, I saw not.

      Chap. II.

   Fifteen days after, when I had fasted and prayed much to the Lord, the
   knowledge of the writing was revealed to me. Now the writing was to
   this effect: "Your seed, O Hermas, has sinned against God, and they
   have blasphemed against [58] the Lord, and in their great wickedness
   they have betrayed their parents. And they passed as traitors of their
   parents, and by their treachery did they not [59] reap profit. And even
   now they have added to their sins lusts and iniquitous pollutions, and
   thus their iniquities have been filled up. But make known [60] these
   words to all your children, and to your wife, who is to be your sister.
   For she does not [61] restrain her tongue, with which she commits
   iniquity; but, on hearing these words, she will control herself, and
   will obtain mercy. For after you have made known to them these words
   which my Lord has commanded me to reveal to you, [62] then shall they
   be forgiven all the sins which in former times they committed, and
   forgiveness will be granted to all the saints who have sinned even to
   the present day, if they repent with all their heart, and drive all
   doubts from their minds. [63] For the Lord has sworn by His glory, in
   regard to His elect, that if any one of them sin after a certain day
   which has been fixed, he shall not be saved. For the repentance of the
   righteous has limits. [64] Filled up are the days of repentance to all
   the saints; but to the heathen, repentance will be possible even to the
   last day. You will tell, therefore, those who preside over the Church,
   to direct their ways in righteousness, that they may receive in full
   the promises with great glory. Stand stedfast, therefore, ye who work
   righteousness, and doubt not, [65] that your passage [66] may be with
   the holy angels. Happy ye who endure the great tribulation that is
   coming on, and happy they who shall not deny their own life. [67] For
   the Lord hath sworn by His Son, that those who denied their Lord have
   abandoned their life in despair, for even now these are to deny Him in
   the days that are coming. [68] To those who denied in earlier times,
   God became [69] gracious, on account of His exceeding tender mercy."

      Chap. III.

   "But as for you, Hermas, remember not the wrongs done to you by your
   children, nor neglect your sister, that they may be cleansed from their
   former sins. For they will be instructed with righteous instruction, if
   you remember not the wrongs they have done you. For the remembrance of
   wrongs worketh death. [70] And you, Hermas, have endured great personal
   [71] tribulations on account of the transgressions of your house,
   because you did not attend to them, but were careless [72] and engaged
   in your wicked transactions. But [73] you are saved, because you did
   not depart from the living God, and on account of your simplicity and
   great self-control. These have saved you, if you remain stedfast. And
   they will save all who act in the same manner, and walk in
   guilelessness and simplicity. Those who possess such virtues will wax
   strong against every form of wickedness, and will abide unto eternal
   life. Blessed are all they who practice righteousness, for they shall
   never be destroyed. Now you will tell Maximus: Lo! [74] tribulation
   cometh on. If it seemeth good to thee, deny again. The Lord is near to
   them who return unto Him, as it is written in Eldad and Modat, [75] who
   prophesied to the people in the wilderness."

      Chap. IV.

   Now a revelation was given to me, my brethren, while I slept, by a
   young man of comely appearance, who said to me, "Who do you think that
   old woman is from whom you received the book?" And I said, "The Sibyl."
   "You are in a mistake," says he; "it is not the Sibyl." "Who is it
   then?" say I. And he said, "It is the Church." [76] And I said to him,
   "Why then is she an old woman?" "Because," said he, "she was created
   first of all. On this account is she old. And for her sake was the
   world made." After that I saw a vision in my house, and that old woman
   came and asked me, if I had yet given the book to the presbyters. And I
   said that I had not. And then she said, "You have done well, for I have
   some words to add. But when I finish all the words, all the elect will
   then become acquainted with them through you. You will write therefore
   two books, and you will send the one to Clemens and the other to
   Grapte. [77] And Clemens will send his to foreign countries, for
   permission has been granted to him to do so. [78] And Grapte will
   admonish the widows and the orphans. But you will read the words in
   this city, along with the presbyters who preside over the Church."

   [78] [Here, as in places that follow, is to be noted a development of
   canon law, that could hardly have existed in the days of the Pauline
   Hermas. He is supposed to be a lector, who might read for the
   edification of the elect, if permitted by the presbyters. Grapte, the
   deaconess, is supposed to have charge of widows and orphans; while
   Clement, only, has canonical right to authenticate books to foreign
   churches, as the Eastern bishops were accustomed to authenticate
   canonical Scriptures to him and others. The second Hermas falls into
   such anachronisms innocently, but they betray the fiction of his work.
   Compare the Apost. Constitutions with (apocryphal) authentications by
   Clement.]

    Vision Third.

      Concerning the Building of the Triumphant Church, and the Various Classes
      of Reprobate Men.

      Chap. I.

   The vision which I saw, my brethren, was of the following nature.
   Having fasted frequently, and having prayed to the Lord that He would
   show me the revelation which He promised to show me through that old
   woman, the same night that old woman appeared to me, and said to me,
   "Since you are so anxious and eager to know all things, go into the
   part of the country where you tarry; and about the fifth [79] hour I
   shall appear unto you, and show you all that you ought to see." I asked
   her, saying "Lady, into what part of the country am I to go?" And she
   said, "Into any part you wish." Then I chose a spot which was suitable,
   and retired. Before, however, I began to speak and to mention the
   place, she said to me, "I will come where you wish." Accordingly, I
   went to the country, and counted the hours, and reached the place where
   I had promised to meet her. And I see an ivory seat ready placed, and
   on it a linen cushion, and above the linen cushion was spread a
   covering of fine linen. [80] Seeing these laid out, and yet no one in
   the place, I began to feel awe, and as it were a trembling seized hold
   of me, and my hair stood on end, and as it were a horror came upon me
   when I saw that I was all alone. But on coming back to myself and
   calling to mind the glory of God, I took courage, bent my knees, and
   again confessed my sins to God as I had done before. [81] Whereupon the
   old woman approached, accompanied by six young men whom I had also seen
   before; and she stood behind me, and listened to me, as I prayed and
   confessed my sins to the Lord. And touching me she said, "Hermas, cease
   praying continually for your sins; pray for righteousness, [82] that
   you may have a portion of it immediately in your house." On this, she
   took me up by the hand, and brought me to the seat, and said to the
   young men, "Go and build." When the young men had gone and we were
   alone, she said to me, "Sit here." I say to her, "Lady, permit my
   elders [83] to be seated first." "Do what I bid you," said she; "sit
   down." When I would have sat down on her right, she did not permit me,
   but with her hand beckoned to me to sit down on the left. While I was
   thinking about this, and feeling vexed that she did not let me sit on
   the right, she said, "Are you vexed, Hermas? The place to the right is
   for others who have already pleased God, and have suffered for His
   name's sake; and you have yet much to accomplish before you can sit
   with them. But abide as you now do in your simplicity, and you will sit
   with them, and with all who do their deeds and bear what they have
   borne."

      Chap. II.

   "What have they borne?" said I. "Listen," said she: "scourges, prisons,
   great tribulations, crosses, wild beasts, [84] for God's name's sake.
   On this account is assigned to them the division of sanctification on
   the right hand, and to every one who shall suffer for God's name: to
   the rest is assigned the division on the left. But both for those who
   sit on the right, and those who sit on the left, there are the same
   gifts and promises; only those sit on the right, and have some glory.
   You then are eager to sit on the right with them, but your shortcomings
   are many. But you will be cleansed from your shortcomings; and all who
   are not given to doubts shall be cleansed from all their iniquities up
   till this day." Saying this, she wished to go away. But falling down at
   her feet, I begged her by the Lord that she would show me the vision
   which she had promised to show me. And then she again took hold of me
   by the hand, and raised me, and made me sit on the seat to the left;
   and lifting up a splendid rod, [85] she said to me, "Do you see
   something great?" And I say, "Lady, I see nothing." She said to me,
   "Lo! do you not see opposite to you a great tower, built upon the
   waters, of splendid square stones?" For the tower was built square [86]
   by those six young men who had come with her. But myriads of men were
   carrying stones to it, some dragging them from the depths, others
   removing them from the land, and they handed them to these six young
   men. They were taking them and building; and those of the stones that
   were dragged out of the depths, they placed in the building just as
   they were: for they were polished and fitted exactly into the other
   stones, and became so united one with another that the lines of
   juncture could not be perceived. [87] And in this way the building of
   the tower looked as if it were made out of one stone. Those stones,
   however, which were taken from the earth suffered a different fate; for
   the young men rejected some of them, some they fitted into the
   building, and some they cut down, and cast far away from the tower.
   Many other stones, however, lay around the tower, and the young men did
   not use them in building; for some of them were rough, others had
   cracks in them, others had been made too short, [88] and others were
   white and round, but did not fit into the building of the tower.
   Moreover, I saw other stones thrown far away from the tower, and
   falling into the public road; yet they did not remain on the road, but
   were rolled into a pathless place. And I saw others falling into the
   fire and burning, others falling close to the water, and yet not
   capable of being rolled into the water, though they wished to be rolled
   down, and to enter the water.

      Chap. III.

   On showing me these visions, she wished to retire. I said to her, "What
   is the use of my having seen all this, while I do not know what it
   means?" She said to me, "You are a cunning fellow, wishing to know
   everything that relates to the tower." "Even so, O Lady," said I, "that
   I may tell it to my brethren, that, hearing this, they may know the
   Lord in much glory." [89] And she said, "Many indeed shall hear, and
   hearing, some shall be glad, and some shall weep. But even these, if
   they hear and repent, shall also rejoice. Hear, then, the parables of
   the tower; for I will reveal all to you, and give me no more trouble in
   regard to revelation: for these revelations have an end, for they have
   been completed. But you will not cease praying for revelations, for you
   are shameless. [90] The tower which you see building is myself, the
   Church, who have appeared to you now and on the former occasion. Ask,
   then, whatever you like in regard to the tower, and I will reveal it to
   you, that you may rejoice with the saints." I said unto her, "Lady,
   since you have vouchsafed to reveal all to me this once, reveal it."
   She said to me, "Whatsoever ought to be revealed, will be revealed;
   only let your heart be with God, [91] and doubt not whatsoever you
   shall see." I asked her, "Why was the tower built upon the waters, O
   Lady?" She answered, "I told you before, [92] and you still inquire
   carefully: therefore inquiring you shall find the truth. Hear then why
   the tower is built upon the waters. It is because your life has been,
   and will be, saved through water. For the tower was founder on the word
   of the almighty and glorious Name and it is kept together by the
   invisible power of the Lord." [93]

      Chap. IV.

   In reply I said to her, "This is magnificent and marvellous. But who
   are the six young men who are engaged in building?" And she said,
   "These are the holy angels of God, who were first created, and to whom
   the Lord handed over His whole creation, that they might increase and
   build up and rule over the whole creation. By these will the building
   of the tower be finished." "But who are the other persons who are
   engaged in carrying the stones?" "These also are holy angels of the
   Lord, but the former six are more excellent than these. The building of
   the tower will be finished, [94] and all will rejoice together around
   the tower, and they will glorify God, because the tower is finished." I
   asked her, saying, "Lady, I should like to know what became of the
   stones, and what was meant by the various kinds of stones?" In reply
   she said to me, "Not because you are [95] more deserving than all
   others that this revelation should be made to you--for there are others
   before you, and better than you, to whom these visions should have been
   revealed--but that the name of God may be glorified, has the revelation
   been made to you, and it will be made on account of the doubtful who
   ponder in their hearts whether these things will be or not. Tell them
   that all these things are true, and that none of them is beyond the
   truth. All of them are firm and sure, and established on a strong
   foundation."

      Chap. V.

   "Hear now with regard to the stones which are in the building. Those
   square white stones which fitted exactly into each other, are apostles,
   bishops, teachers, and deacons, who have lived in godly purity, and
   have acted as bishops and teachers and deacons chastely and reverently
   to the elect of God. Some of them have fallen asleep, and some still
   remain alive. [96] And they have always agreed with each other, and
   been at peace among themselves, [97] and listened to each other. On
   account of this, they join exactly into the building of the tower."
   "But who are the stones that were dragged from the depths, and which
   were laid into the building and fitted in with the rest of the stones
   previously placed in the tower?" "They are those [98] who suffered for
   the Lord's sake." "But I wish to know, O Lady, who are the other stones
   which were carried from the land." "Those," she said, "which go into
   the building without being polished, are those whom God has approved
   of, for they walked in the straight ways of the Lord and practiced His
   commandments." "But who are those who are in the act of being brought
   and placed in the building?" "They are those who are young in faith and
   are faithful. But they are admonished by the angels to do good, for no
   iniquity has been found in them." "Who then are those whom they
   rejected and cast away?" [99] "These are they who have sinned, and wish
   to repent. On this account they have not been thrown far from the
   tower, because they will yet be useful in the building, if they repent.
   Those then who are to repent, if they do repent, will be strong in
   faith, if they now repent while the tower is building. For if the
   building be finished, there will not be more room for any one, but he
   will be rejected. [100] This privilege, however, will belong only to
   him who has now been placed near the tower."

      Chap. VI.

   "As to those who were cut down and thrown far away from the tower, do
   you wish to know who they are? They are the sons of iniquity, and they
   believed in hypocrisy, and wickedness did not depart from them. For
   this reason they are not saved, since they cannot be used in the
   building on account of their iniquities. Wherefore they have been cut
   off and cast far away on account of the anger of the Lord, for they
   have roused Him to anger. But I shall explain to you the other stones
   which you saw lying in great numbers, and not going into the building.
   Those which are rough are those who have known the truth and not
   remained in it, nor have they been joined to the saints. [101] On this
   account are they unfit for use." "Who are those that have rents?"
   "These are they who are at discord in their hearts one with another,
   and are not at peace amongst themselves: they indeed keep peace before
   each other, but when they separate one from the other, their wicked
   thoughts remain in their hearts. These, then, are the rents which are
   in the stones. But those which are shortened are those who have indeed
   believed, and have the larger share of righteousness; yet they have
   also a considerable share of iniquity, and therefore they are shortened
   and not whole." "But who are these, Lady, that are white and round, and
   yet do not fit into the building of the tower?" She answered and said,
   "How long will you be foolish and stupid, and continue to put every
   kind of question and understand nothing? These are those who have faith
   indeed, but they have also the riches of this world. When, therefore,
   tribulation comes, on account of their riches and business they deny
   the Lord." [102] I answered and said to her, "When, then, will they be
   useful for the building, Lady?" "When the riches that now seduce them
   have been circumscribed, then will they be of use to God. [103] For as
   a round stone cannot become square unless portions be cut off and cast
   away, so also those who are rich in this world cannot be useful to the
   Lord unless their riches be cut down. Learn this first from your own
   case. When you were rich, you were useless; but now you are useful and
   fit for life. Be ye useful to God; for you also will be used as one of
   these stones." [104]

      Chap. VII.

   "Now the other stones which you saw cast far away from the tower, and
   falling upon the public road and rolling from it into pathless places,
   are those who have indeed believed, but through doubt have abandoned
   the true road. Thinking, then, that they could find a better, they
   wander and become wretched, and enter upon pathless places. But those
   which fell into the fire and were burned [105] are those who have
   departed for ever from the living God; nor does the thought of
   repentance ever come into their hearts, on account of their devotion to
   their lusts and to the crimes which they committed. Do you wish to know
   who are the others which fell near the waters, but could not be rolled
   into them? These are they who have heard the word, and wish to be
   baptized in the name of the Lord; but when the chastity demanded by the
   truth comes into their recollection, they draw back, [106] and again
   walk after their own wicked desires." She finished her exposition of
   the tower. But I, shameless as I yet was, asked her, "Is repentance
   possible for all those stones which have been cast away and did not fit
   into the building of the tower, and will they yet have a place in this
   tower?" "Repentance," said she, "is yet possible, but in this tower
   they cannot find a suitable place. But in another [107] and much
   inferior place they will be laid, and that, too, only when they have
   been tortured and completed the days of their sins. And on this account
   will they be transferred, because they have partaken of the righteous
   Word. [108] And then only will they be removed from their punishments
   when the thought of repenting of the evil deeds which they have done
   has come into their hearts. But if it does not come into their hearts,
   they will not be saved, on account of the hardness of their heart."

      Chap. VIII.

   When then I ceased asking in regard to all these matters, she said to
   me, "Do you wish to see anything else?" And as I was extremely eager to
   see something more, my countenance beamed with joy. She looked towards
   me with a smile, and said, "Do you see seven women around the tower?"
   "I do, Lady," said I. "This tower," said she, "is supported by them
   according to the precept of the Lord. Listen now to their functions.
   The first of them, who is clasping her hands, is called Faith. Through
   her the elect of God are saved. [109] Another, who has her garments
   tucked up [110] and acts with vigour, is called Self-restraint. She is
   the daughter of Faith. Whoever then follows her will become happy in
   his life, because he will restrain himself from all evil works,
   believing that, if he restrain himself from all evil desire, he will
   inherit eternal life." "But the others," said I, "O Lady, who are
   they?" And she said to me, "They are daughters of each other. One of
   them is called Simplicity, another Guilelessness, another Chastity,
   another Intelligence, another Love. When then you do all the works of
   their mother, [111] you will be able to live." "I should like to know,"
   said I, "O Lady, what power each one of them possesses." "Hear," she
   said, "what power they have. Their powers are regulated [112] by each
   other, and follow each other in the order of their birth. For from
   Faith arises Self-restraint; from Self-restraint, Simplicity; from
   Simplicity, Guilelessness; from Guilelessness, Chastity; from Chastity,
   Intelligence; and from Intelligence, Love. The deeds, then, of these
   are pure, and chaste, and divine. Whoever devotes himself to these, and
   is able to hold fast by their works, shall have his dwelling in the
   tower with the saints of God." Then I asked her in regard to the ages,
   if now there is the conclusion. She cried out with a loud voice,
   "Foolish man! do you not see the tower yet building? When the tower is
   finished and built, then comes the end; and I assure you it will be
   soon finished. Ask me no more questions. Let you and all the saints be
   content with what I have called to your remembrance, and with my
   renewal of your spirits. But observe that it is not for your own sake
   only that these revelations have been made to you, but they have been
   given you that you may show them to all. For [113] after three
   days--this you will take care to remember--I command you to speak all
   the words which I am to say to you into the ears of the saints, that
   hearing them and doing them, they may be cleansed from their
   iniquities, and you along with them."

      Chap. IX.

   Give ear unto me, O Sons: I have brought you up in much simplicity, and
   guilelessness, and chastity, on account of the mercy of the Lord, [114]
   who has dropped His righteousness down upon you, that ye may be made
   righteous and holy [115] from all your iniquity and depravity; but you
   do not wish to rest from your iniquity. Now, therefore, listen to me,
   and be at peace one with another, and visit each other, and bear each
   other's burdens, and do not partake of God's creatures alone, [116] but
   give abundantly of them to the needy. For some through the abundance of
   their food produce weakness in their flesh, and thus corrupt their
   flesh; while the flesh of others who have no food is corrupted, because
   they have not sufficient nourishment. And on this account their bodies
   waste away. This intemperance in eating is thus injurious to you who
   have abundance and do not distribute among those who are needy. Give
   heed to the judgment that is to come. Ye, therefore, who are high in
   position, seek out the hungry as long as the tower is not yet finished;
   for after the tower is finished, you will wish to do good, but will
   find no opportunity. Give heed, therefore, ye who glory in your wealth,
   lest those who are needy should groan, and their groans should ascend
   to the Lord, [117] and ye be shut out with all your goods beyond the
   gate of the tower. Wherefore I now say to you who preside over the
   Church and love the first seats, [118] "Be not like to drug-mixers. For
   the drug-mixers carry their drugs in boxes, but ye carry your drug and
   poison in your heart. Ye are hardened, and do not wish to cleanse your
   hearts, and to add unity of aim to purity of heart, that you may have
   mercy from the great King. Take heed, therefore, children, that these
   dissensions of yours do not deprive you of your life. How will you
   instruct the elect of the Lord, if you yourselves have not instruction?
   Instruct each other therefore, and be at peace among yourselves, that
   [119] I also, standing joyful before your Father, may give an account
   of you all to your Lord." [120]

      Chap. X.

   On her ceasing to speak to me, those six young men who were engaged in
   building came and conveyed her to the tower, and other four lifted up
   the seat and carried it also to the tower. The faces of these last I
   did not see, for they were turned away from me. And as she was going, I
   asked her to reveal to me the meaning of the three forms in which she
   appeared to me. In reply she said to me: "With regard to them, you must
   ask another to reveal their meaning to you." For she had appeared to
   me, brethren, in the first vision the previous year under the form of
   an exceedingly old woman, sitting in a chair. In the second vision her
   face was youthful, but her skin and hair betokened age, and she stood
   while she spoke to me. She was also more joyful than on the first
   occasion. But in the third vision she was entirely youthful and
   exquisitely beautiful, except only that she had the hair of an old
   woman; but her face beamed with joy, and she sat on a seat. Now I was
   exceeding sad in regard to these appearances, for I longed much to know
   what the visions meant. Then I see the old woman in a vision of the
   night saying unto me: "Every prayer should be accompanied with
   humility: fast, [121] therefore, and you will obtain from the Lord what
   you beg." I fasted therefore for one day.

   That very night there appeared to me a young man, who said, "Why do you
   frequently ask revelations in prayer? Take heed lest by asking many
   things you injure your flesh: be content with these revelations. Will
   you be able to see greater [122] revelations than those which you have
   seen?" I answered and said to him, "Sir, one thing only I ask, that in
   regard to these three forms the revelation may be rendered complete."
   He answered me, "How long are ye senseless? [123] But your doubts make
   you senseless, because you have not your hearts turned towards the
   Lord." But I answered and said to him, "From you, sir, we shall learn
   these things more accurately."

      Chap. XI.

   "Hear then," said he, "with regard to the three forms, concerning which
   you are inquiring. Why in the first vision did she appear to you as an
   old woman seated on a chair? Because your spirit is now old and
   withered up, and has lost its power in consequence of your infirmities
   and doubts. For, like elderly men who have no hope of renewing their
   strength, and expect nothing but their last sleep, so you, weakened by
   worldly occupations, have given yourselves up to sloth, and have not
   cast your cares upon the Lord. [124] Your spirit therefore is broken,
   and you have grown old in your sorrows." "I should like then to know,
   sir, why she sat on a chair?" He answered, "Because every weak person
   sits on a chair on account of his weakness, that his weakness may be
   sustained. Lo! you have the form of the first vision."

      Chap. XII.

   "Now in the second vision you saw her standing with a youthful
   countenance, and more joyful than before; still she had the skin and
   hair of an aged woman. Hear," said he, "this parable also. When one
   becomes somewhat old, he despairs of himself on account of his weakness
   and poverty, and looks forward to nothing but the last day of his life.
   Then suddenly an inheritance is left him: and hearing of this, he rises
   up, and becoming exceeding joyful, he puts on strength. And now he no
   longer reclines, but stands up; and his spirit, already destroyed by
   his previous actions, is renewed, [125] and he no longer sits, but acts
   with vigour. So happened it with you on hearing the revelation which
   God gave you. For the Lord had compassion on you, and renewed your
   spirit, and ye laid aside your infirmities. Vigour arose within you,
   and ye grew strong in faith; and the Lord, [126] seeing your strength,
   rejoiced. On this account He showed you the building of the tower; and
   He will show you other things, if you continue at peace with each other
   with all your heart."

      Chap. XIII.

   "Now, in the third vision, you saw her still younger, and she was noble
   and joyful, and her shape was beautiful. [127] For, just as when some
   good news comes suddenly to one who is sad, immediately he forgets his
   former sorrows, and looks for nothing else than the good news which he
   has heard, and for the future is made strong for good, and his spirit
   is renewed on account of the joy which he has received; so ye also have
   received the renewal of your spirits by seeing these good things. As to
   your seeing her sitting on a seat, that means that her position is one
   of strength, for a seat has four feet and stands firmly. For the world
   also is kept together by means of four elements. Those, therefore, who
   repent completely and with the whole heart, will become young and
   firmly established. You now have the revelation completely given you.
   [128] Make no further demands for revelations. If anything ought to be
   revealed, it will be revealed to you."

    Vision Fourth.

      Concerning the Trial and Tribulation that are to Come Upon Men.

      Chap. I.

   Twenty days after the former vision I saw another vision, brethren
   [129] --a representation of the tribulation [130] that is to come. I
   was going to a country house along the Campanian road. Now the house
   lay about ten furlongs from the public road. The district is one rarely
   [131] traversed. And as I walked alone, I prayed the Lord to complete
   the revelations which He had made to me through His holy Church, that
   He might strengthen me, [132] and give repentance to all His servants
   who were going astray, that His great and glorious name might be
   glorified because He vouchsafed to show me His marvels. [133] And while
   I was glorifying Him and giving Him thanks, a voice, as it were,
   answered me, "Doubt not, Hermas;" and I began to think with myself, and
   to say, "What reason have I to doubt--I who have been established by
   the Lord, and who have seen such glorious sights?" I advanced a little,
   brethren, and, lo! I see dust rising even to the heavens. I began to
   say to myself, "Are cattle approaching and raising the dust?" It was
   about a furlong's distance from me. And, lo! I see the dust rising more
   and more, so that I imagined that it was something sent from God. But
   the sun now shone out a little, and, lo! I see a mighty beast like a
   whale, and out of its mouth fiery locusts [134] proceeded. But the size
   of that beast was about a hundred feet, and it had a head like an urn.
   [135] I began to weep, and to call on the Lord to rescue me from it.
   Then I remembered the word which I had heard, "Doubt not, O Hermas."
   Clothed, therefore, my brethren, with faith in the Lord [136] and
   remembering the great things which He had taught me, I boldly faced the
   beast. Now that beast came on with such noise and force, that it could
   itself have destroyed a city. [137] I came near it, and the monstrous
   beast stretched itself out on the ground, and showed nothing but its
   tongue, and did not stir at all until I had passed by it. Now the beast
   had four colours on its head--black, then fiery and bloody, then
   golden, and lastly white.

      Chap. II.

   Now after I had passed by the wild beast, and had moved forward about
   thirty feet, lo! a virgin meets me, adorned as if she were proceeding
   from the bridal chamber, clothed entirely in white, and with white
   sandals, and veiled up to her forehead, and her head was covered by a
   hood. [138] And she had white hair. I knew from my former visions that
   this was the Church, and I became more joyful. She saluted me, and
   said, "Hail, O man!" And I returned her salutation, and said, "Lady,
   hail!" And she answered, and said to me, "Has nothing crossed your
   path?" I say, "I was met by a beast of such a size that it could
   destroy peoples, but through the power of the Lord [139] and His great
   mercy I escaped from it." "Well did you escape from it," says she,
   "because you cast your care [140] on God, [141] and opened your heart
   to the Lord, believing that you can be saved by no other than by His
   great and glorious name. [142] On this account the Lord has sent His
   angel, who has rule over the beasts, and whose name is Thegri, [143]
   and has shut up its mouth, so that it cannot tear you. You have escaped
   from great tribulation on account of your faith, and because you did
   not doubt in the presence of such a beast. Go, therefore, and tell the
   elect of the Lord [144] His mighty deeds, and say to them that this
   beast is a type of the great tribulation that is coming. If then ye
   prepare yourselves, and repent with all your heart, and turn to the
   Lord, it will be possible for you to escape it, if your heart be pure
   and spotless, and ye spend the rest of the days of your life in serving
   the Lord blamelessly. Cast your cares upon the Lord, and He will direct
   them. Trust the Lord, ye who doubt, for He is all-powerful, and can
   turn His anger away from you, and send scourges [145] on the doubters.
   Woe to those who hear these words, and despise them: [146] better were
   it for them not to have been born." [147]

      Chap. III.

   I asked her about the four colours which the beast had on his head. And
   she answered, and said to me, "Again you are inquisitive in regard to
   such matters." "Yea, Lady," said I, "make known to me what they are."
   "Listen," said she: "the black is the world in which we dwell: but the
   fiery and bloody points out that the world must perish through blood
   and fire: but the golden part are you who have escaped from this world.
   For as gold is tested by fire, and thus becomes useful, so are you
   tested who dwell in it. Those, therefore, who continue stedfast, and
   are put through the fire, will be purified by means of it. For as gold
   casts away its dross, so also will ye cast away all sadness and
   straitness, and will be made pure so as to fit into the building of the
   tower. But the white part is the age that is to come, in which the
   elect of God will dwell, since those elected by God to eternal life
   will be spotless and pure. Wherefore cease not speaking these things
   into the ears of the saints. This then is the type of the great
   tribulation that is to come. If ye wish it, it will be nothing.
   Remember those things which were written down before." And saying this,
   she departed. But I saw not into what place she retired. There was a
   noise, however, and I turned round in alarm, thinking that that beast
   was coming. [148]

    Vision Fifth.

      Concerning the Commandments. [149]

   After I had been praying at home, and had sat down on my couch, there
   entered a man of glorious aspect, dressed like a shepherd, with a white
   goat's skin, a wallet on his shoulders, and a rod in his hand, and
   saluted me. I returned his salutation. And straightway he sat down
   beside me, and said to me, "I have been sent by a most venerable angel
   to dwell with you the remaining days of your life." And I thought that
   he had come to tempt me, and I said to him, "Who are you? For I know
   him to whom I have been entrusted." He said to me, "Do you not know
   me?" "No," said I. "I," said he, "am that shepherd to whom you have
   been entrusted." And while he yet spake, his figure was changed; and
   then I knew that it was he to whom I had been entrusted. And
   straightway I became confused, and fear took hold of me, and I was
   overpowered with deep sorrow that I had answered him so wickedly and
   foolishly. But he answered, and said to me, "Do not be confounded, but
   receive strength from the commandments which I am going to give you.
   For I have been sent," said he, "to show you again all the things which
   you saw before, especially those of them which are useful to you. First
   of all, then, write down my commandments and similitudes, and you will
   write the other things as I shall show you. For this purpose," said he,
   "I command you to write down the commandments and similitudes first,
   that you may read them easily, and be able to keep them." [150]
   Accordingly I wrote down the commandments and similitudes, exactly as
   he had ordered me. If then, when you have heard these, ye keep them and
   walk in them, and practice them with pure minds, you will receive from
   the Lord all that He has promised to you. But if, after you have heard
   them, ye do not repent, but continue to add to your sins, then shall ye
   receive from the Lord the opposite things. All these words did the
   shepherd, even the angel of repentance, command me to write. [151]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [149] [This vision naturally belongs to book ii., to which it is a
   preface.]

   [150] Keep them. That you may be able to keep them more easily by
   reading them from time to time.--Vat.

   [151] ["The Shepherd," then, is the "angel of repentance," here
   represented as a guardian angel. This gives the work its character, as
   enforcing primarily the anti-Montanist principle of the value of true
   repentance in the sight of God.]

    Commandment First.

      On Faith in God.

   First of all, believe [152] that there is one God who created and
   finished all things, and made all things out of nothing. He alone is
   able to contain the whole, but Himself cannot be contained. [153] Have
   faith therefore in Him, and fear Him; and fearing Him, exercise
   self-control. Keep these commands, and you will cast away from you all
   wickedness, and put on the strength of righteousness, and live to God,
   if you keep this commandment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [152] [These first words are quoted by Irenæus, vol. i. p. 488, this
   series. Note that this book begins with the fundamental principle of
   faith, which is everywhere identified by Hermas (as in Vision ii. cap.
   2) with faith in the Son of God. The Holy Spirit is also everywhere
   exhibited in this work. But the careful student will discover a very
   deep plan in the treatment of this subject. Repentance and faith are
   the great themes, and the long-suffering of God, against the
   Montanists. But he begins by indicating the divine character and the
   law of God. He treats of sin in its relations to the law and the
   gospel: little by little, opening the way, he reaches a point, in the
   Eighth Similitude, where he introduces the New Law, identifying it,
   indeed, with the old, but magnifying the gospel of the Son of God.
   Hermas takes for granted the "Son of man;" but everywhere he avoids the
   names of His humanity, and brings out "the Son of God" with emphasis,
   in the spirit of St. John's Gospel (cap. i.) and of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews (cap. i.), as if he feared the familiarities even of believers
   in speaking of Jesus or of Christ, without recognising His eternal
   power and Godhead.]

   [153] Contained.--Vat. and Pal. add: and who cannot be defined in
   words, nor conceived by the mind. [Here we have the "Incomprehensible,"
   so familiar in the liturgic formula improperly called the Athanasian
   Creed. In the Latin immensus, in the Greek apeiros; i.e., "non
   mensurabilis, quiâ inlocalis, incircumscriptus, ubique totus, ubique
   proesens, ubique potens." Not intelligible is too frequently supposed
   to be the sense, but this is feeble and ambiguous. See Waterland,
   Works, iv. p. 320 London, 1823.]
     __________________________________________________________________

    Commandment Second.

      On Avoiding Evil-Speaking, and on Giving Alms in Simplicity.

   He said to me, "Be simple and guileless, and you will be as the
   children who know not the wickedness that ruins the life of men. First,
   then, speak evil of no one, nor listen with pleasure to any one who
   speaks evil of another. But if you listen, you will partake of the sin
   of him who speaks evil, if you believe the slander which you hear;
   [154] for believing it, you will also have something to say against
   your brother. Thus, then, will you be guilty of the sin of him who
   slanders. For slander is evil [155] and an unsteady demon. It never
   abides in peace, but always remains in discord. Keep yourself from it,
   and you will always be at peace with all. Put on a holiness in which
   there is no wicked cause of offence, but all deeds that are equable and
   joyful. Practise goodness; and from the rewards of your labours, which
   God gives you, give to all the needy in simplicity, not hesitating as
   to whom you are to give or not to give. Give to all, for God wishes His
   gifts to be shared amongst all. They who receive, will render an
   account to God why and for what they have received. For the afflicted
   who receive will not be condemned, [156] but they who receive on false
   pretences will suffer punishment. He, then, who gives is guiltless. For
   as he received from the Lord, so has he accomplished his service in
   simplicity, not hesitating as to whom he should give and to whom he
   should not give. This service, then, if accomplished in simplicity, is
   glorious with God. He, therefore, who thus ministers in simplicity,
   will live to God. [157] Keep therefore these commandments, as I have
   given them to you, that your repentance and the repentance of your
   house may be found in simplicity, and your heart [158] may be pure and
   stainless."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [154] If ... brother. [Jas. iv. 11.] And if you believe the slanderer,
   you will also be guilty of sin, in that you have belived one who speaks
   evil of your brother.--Vat. For if you give your assent to the
   detractor, and believe what is said of one in his absence, you also
   will be like to him, and acting ruinously towards your brother, and you
   are guilty of the same sin as the person who slanders.--Pal.

   [155] For slander is ruinous.--Vat. For it is wicked to slander any
   one.--Pal.

    Commandment Third.

      On Avoiding Falsehood, and on the Repentance of Hermas for His
      Dissimulation.

   Again he said to me, "Love the truth, and let nothing but truth proceed
   from your mouth, [159] that the spirit which God has placed in your
   flesh may be found truthful before all men; and the Lord, who dwelleth
   in you, [160] will be glorified, because the Lord is truthful in every
   word, and in Him is no falsehood. They therefore who lie deny the Lord,
   and rob Him, not giving back to Him the deposit which they have
   received. For they received from Him a spirit free from falsehood.
   [161] If they give him back this spirit untruthful, they pollute the
   commandment of the Lord, and become robbers." On hearing these words, I
   wept most violently. When he saw me weeping, he said to me, "Why do you
   weep?" And I said, "Because, sir, I know not if I can be saved." "Why?"
   said he. And I said, "Because, sir, I never spake a true word in my
   life, but have ever spoken cunningly to all, [162] and have affirmed a
   lie for the truth to all; and no one ever contradicted me, but credit
   was given to my word. How then can I live, since I have acted thus?"
   And he said to me, "Your feelings are indeed right and sound, for you
   ought as a servant of God to have walked in truth, and not to have
   joined an evil conscience with the spirit of truth, nor to have caused
   sadness to the holy and true Spirit." [163] And I said to him, "Never,
   sir, did I listen to these words with so much attention." And he said
   to me, "Now you hear them, and keep them, that even the falsehoods
   which you formerly told in your transactions may come to be believed
   through the truthfulness of your present statements. For even they can
   become worthy of credit. If you keep these precepts, and from this time
   forward you speak nothing but the truth, [164] it will be possible for
   you to obtain life. And whosoever shall hear this commandment, and
   depart from that great wickedness falsehood, shall live to God."

    Commandment Fourth.

      On Putting One's Wife Away for Adultery.

      Chap. I.

   "I charge you," said he, "to guard your chastity, and let no thought
   enter your heart of another man's wife, or of fornication, or of
   similar iniquities; for by doing this you commit a great sin. But if
   you always remember your own wife, you will never sin. For if this
   thought [165] enter your heart, then you will sin; and if, in like
   manner, you think other wicked thoughts, you commit sin. For this
   thought is great sin in a servant of God. But if any one commit this
   wicked deed, he works death for himself. Attend, therefore, and refrain
   from this thought; for where purity dwells, there iniquity ought not to
   enter the heart of a righteous man." I said to him, "Sir, permit me to
   ask you a few questions." [166] "Say on," said he. And I said to him,
   "Sir, if any one has a wife who trusts in the Lord, and if he detect
   her in adultery, does the man sin if he continue to live with her?" And
   he said to me, "As long as he remains ignorant of her sin, the husband
   commits no transgression in living with her. But if the husband know
   that his wife has gone astray, and if the woman does not repent, but
   persists in her fornication, and yet the husband continues to live with
   her, he also is guilty of her crime, and a sharer in her adultery." And
   I said to him, "What then, sir, is the husband to do, if his wife
   continue in her vicious practices?" And he said, "The husband should
   put her away, and remain by himself. But if he put his wife away and
   marry another, he also commits adultery." [167] And I said to him,
   "What if the woman put away should repent, and wish to return to her
   husband: shall she not be taken back by her husband?" And he said to
   me, "Assuredly. If the husband do not take her back, he sins, and
   brings a great sin upon himself; for he ought to take back the sinner
   who has repented. But not frequently. [168] For there is but one
   repentance to the servants of God. In case, therefore, that the
   divorced wife may repent, the husband ought not to marry another, when
   his wife has been put away. In this matter man and woman are to be
   treated exactly in the same way. Moreover, adultery is committed not
   only by those who pollute their flesh, but by those who imitate the
   heathen in their actions. [169] Wherefore if any one [170] persists in
   such deeds, and repents not, withdraw from him, and cease to live with
   him, otherwise you are a sharer in his sin. Therefore has the
   injunction been laid on you, that you should remain by yourselves, both
   man and woman, for in such persons repentance can take place. But I do
   not," said he, "give opportunity for the doing of these deeds, but that
   he who has sinned may sin no more. But with regard to his previous
   transgressions, there is One who is able to provide a cure; [171] for
   it is He, indeed, who has power over all."

      Chap. II.

   I asked him again, and said, "Since the Lord has vouchsafed to dwell
   always with me, bear with me while I utter a few words; [172] for I
   understand nothing, and my heart has been hardened by my previous mode
   of life. Give me understanding, for I am exceedingly dull, and I
   understand absolutely nothing." And he answered and said unto me, "I am
   set over repentance, and I give understanding to all who repent. Do you
   not think," he said, "that it is great wisdom to repent? for repentance
   is great wisdom. [173] For he who has sinned understands that he acted
   wickedly in the sight of the Lord, and remembers the actions he has
   done, and he repents, and no longer acts wickedly, but does good
   munificently, and humbles and torments his soul because he has sinned.
   You see, therefore, that repentance is great wisdom." And I said to
   him, "It is for this reason, sir, that I inquire carefully into all
   things, especially because I am a sinner; that I may know what works I
   should do, that I may live: for my sins are many and various." And he
   said to me, "You shall live if you keep my commandments, [174] and walk
   in them; and whosoever shall hear and keep these commandments, shall
   live to God."

      Chap. III.

   And I said to him, "I should like to continue my questions." "Speak
   on," said he. And I said, "I heard, sir, some teachers maintain that
   there is no other repentance than that which takes place, when we
   descended into the water [175] and received remission of our former
   sins." He said to me, "That was sound doctrine which you heard; for
   that is really the case. For he who has received remission of his sins
   ought not to sin any more, but to live in purity. Since, however, you
   inquire diligently into all things, I will point this also out to you,
   not as giving occasion for error to those who are to believe, or have
   lately believed, in the Lord. For those who have now believed, and
   those who are to believe, have not repentance for their sins; but they
   have remission of their previous sins. For to those who have been
   called before these days, the Lord has set repentance. For the Lord,
   knowing the heart, and foreknowing all things, knew the weakness of men
   and the manifold wiles of the devil, that he would inflict some evil on
   the servants of God, and would act wickedly towards them. [176] The
   Lord, therefore, being merciful, has had mercy on the work of His hand,
   and has set repentance for them; and He has entrusted to me power over
   this repentance. And therefore I say to you, that if any one is tempted
   by the devil, and sins after that great and holy calling in which the
   Lord has called His people to everlasting life, [177] he has
   opportunity to repent but once. But if he should sin frequently after
   this, and then repent, to such a man his repentance will be of no
   avail; for with difficulty will he live." [178] And I said, "Sir, I
   feel that life has come back to me in listening attentively to these
   commandments; for I know that I shall be saved, if in future I sin no
   more." And he said, "You will be saved, you and all who keep these
   commandments."

      Chap. IV.

   And again I asked him, saying, "Sir, since you have been so patient in
   listening to me, will you show me this also?" "Speak," said he. And I
   said, "If a wife or husband die, and the widower or widow marry, does
   he or she commit sin?" "There is no sin in marrying again," said he;
   "but if they remain unmarried, they gain greater honour and glory with
   the Lord; but if they marry, they do not sin. [179] Guard, therefore,
   your chastity and purity, and you will live to God. What commandments I
   now give you, and what I am to give, keep from henceforth, yea, from
   the very day when you were entrusted to me, and I will dwell in your
   house. And your former sins will be forgiven, if you keep my
   commandments. And all shall be forgiven who keep these my commandments,
   and walk in this chastity."

   [166] Questions. "I charge you," said he, "to guard your chastity, and
   let no thought enter your heart of another man's marriage (i.e., wife),
   or of fornication, for this produces a great transgression. But be
   always mindful of the Lord at all hours, and you will never sin. For if
   this very wicked thought enter your heart, you commit a great sin, and
   they who practice such deeds follow the way of death. Take heed,
   therefore, and refrain from this thought. For where chastity remains in
   the heart of a righteous man, never ought there to arise any evil
   thought." I said to him," Sir, permit me to say a few words to you."

     __________________________________________________________________

    Commandment Fifth.

      Of Sadness of Heart, and of Patience.

      Chap. I.

   "Be patient," said he, "and of good understanding, and you will rule
   over every wicked work, and you will work all righteousness. For if you
   be patient, the Holy Spirit that dwells in you will be pure. He will
   not be darkened by any evil spirit, but, dwelling in a broad region,
   [180] he will rejoice and be glad; and with the vessel in which he
   dwells he will serve God in gladness, having great peace within
   himself. [181] But if any outburst of anger take place, forthwith the
   Holy Spirit, who is tender, is straitened, not having a pure place, and
   He seeks to depart. For he is choked by the vile spirit, and cannot
   attend on the Lord as he wishes, for anger pollutes him. For the Lord
   dwells in long-suffering, but the devil in anger. [182] The two
   spirits, then, when dwelling in the same habitation, are at discord
   with each other, and are troublesome to that man in whom they dwell.
   [183] For if an exceedingly small piece of wormwood be taken and put
   into a jar of honey, is not the honey entirely destroyed, and does not
   the exceedingly small piece of wormwood entirely take away the
   sweetness of the honey, so that it no longer affords any gratification
   to its owner, but has become bitter, and lost its use? But if the
   wormwood be not put into the honey, then the honey remains sweet, and
   is of use to its owner. You see, then, that patience is sweeter than
   honey, and useful to God, and the Lord dwells in it. But anger is
   bitter and useless. Now, if anger be mingled with patience, the
   patience is polluted, [184] and its prayer is not then useful to God."
   "I should like, sir," said I, "to know the power of anger, that I may
   guard myself against it." And he said, "If you do not guard yourself
   against it, you and your house lose all hope of salvation. Guard
   yourself, therefore, against it. For I am with you, and all will depart
   from it who repent with their whole heart. [185] For I will be with
   them, and I will save them all. For all are justified by the most holy
   angel." [186]

      Chap. II.

   "Hear now," said he, "how wicked is the action of anger, and in what
   way it overthrows the servants of God by its action, and turns them
   from righteousness. But it does not turn away those who are full of
   faith, nor does it act on them, for the power of the Lord is with them.
   It is the thoughtless and doubting that it turns away. [187] For as
   soon as it sees such men standing stedfast, it throws itself into their
   hearts, and for nothing at all the man or woman becomes embittered on
   account of occurrences in their daily life, as for instance on account
   of their food, or some superfluous word that has been uttered, or on
   account of some friend, or some gift or debt, or some such senseless
   affair. For all these things are foolish and empty and unprofitable to
   the servants of God. But patience is great, and mighty, and strong, and
   calm in the midst of great enlargement, joyful, rejoicing, free from
   care, glorifying God at all times, having no bitterness in her, and
   abiding continually meek and quiet. Now this patience dwells with those
   who have complete faith. But anger is foolish, and fickle, and
   senseless. Now, of folly is begotten bitterness, and of bitterness
   anger, and of anger frenzy. This frenzy, the product of so many evils,
   ends in great and incurable sin. For when all these spirits dwell in
   one vessel in which the Holy Spirit also dwells, the vessel cannot
   contain them, but overflows. The tender Spirit, then, not being
   accustomed to dwell with the wicked spirit, nor with hardness,
   withdraws from such a man, and seeks to dwell with meekness and
   peacefulness. Then, when he withdraws from the man in whom he dwelt,
   the man is emptied of the righteous Spirit; and being henceforward
   filled with evil spirits, [188] he is in a state of anarchy in every
   action, being dragged hither and thither by the evil spirits, and there
   is a complete darkness in his mind as to everything good. This, then,
   is what happens to all the angry. Wherefore do you depart from that
   most wicked spirit anger, and put on patience, and resist anger and
   bitterness, and you will be found in company with the purity which is
   loved by the Lord. [189] Take care, then, that you neglect not by any
   chance this commandment: for if you obey this commandment, you will be
   able to keep all the other commandments which I am to give you. Be
   strong, then, in these commandments, and put on power, and let all put
   on power, as many as wish to walk in them." [190]

    Commandment Sixth.

      How to Recognise the Two Spirits Attendant on Each Man, and How to
      Distinguish the Suggestions of the One from Those of the Other.

      Chap. I.

   "I gave you," he said, "directions in the first commandment to attend
   to faith, and fear, and self-restraint." "Even so, sir," said I. And he
   said, "Now I wish to show you the powers of these, that you may know
   what power each possesses. For their powers are double, and have
   relation alike to the righteous and the unrighteous. Trust you,
   therefore, the righteous, but put no trust in the unrighteous. For the
   path of righteousness is straight, but that of unrighteousness is
   crooked. But walk in the straight and even way, and mind not the
   crooked. For the crooked path has no roads, but has many pathless
   places and stumbling-blocks in it, and it is rough and thorny. It is
   injurious to those who walk therein. But they who walk in the straight
   road walk evenly without stumbling, because it is neither rough nor
   thorny. You see, then, that it is better to walk in this road." "I wish
   to go by this road," said I. "You will go by it," said he; "and whoever
   turns to the Lord with all his heart will walk in it."

      Chap. II.

   "Hear now," said he, "in regard to faith. There are two angels [191]
   with a man--one of righteousness, and the other of iniquity." And I
   said to him, "How, sir, am I to know the powers of these, for both
   angels dwell with me?" "Hear," said he, and "understand them. The angel
   of righteousness is gentle and modest, meek and peaceful. When,
   therefore, he ascends into your heart, forthwith [192] he talks to you
   of righteousness, purity, chastity, contentment, and of every righteous
   deed and glorious virtue. When all these ascend into your heart, know
   that the angel of righteousness is with you. These are the deeds of the
   angel of righteousness. Trust him, then, and his works. Look now at the
   works of the angel of iniquity. First, he is wrathful, and bitter, and
   foolish, and his works are evil, and ruin the servants of God. When,
   then, he ascends into your heart, know him by his works." And I said to
   him, "How, sir, I shall perceive him, I do not know." "Hear and
   understand" said he. "When anger comes upon you, or harshness, know
   that he is in you; and you will know this to be the case also, when you
   are attacked by a longing after many transactions, [193] and the
   richest delicacies, and drunken revels, and divers luxuries, and things
   improper, and by a hankering after women, and by overreaching, and
   pride, and blustering, and by whatever is like to these. When these
   ascend into your heart, know that the angel of iniquity is in you. Now
   that you know his works, depart from him, and in no respect trust him,
   because his deeds are evil, and unprofitable to the servants of God.
   These, then, are the actions of both angels. Understand them, and trust
   the angel of righteousness; but depart from the angel of iniquity,
   because his instruction is bad in every deed. [194] For though a man be
   most faithful, [195] and the thought of this angel ascend into his
   heart, that man or woman must sin. On the other hand, be a man or woman
   ever so bad, yet, if the works of the angel of righteousness ascend
   into his or her heart, he or she must do something good. You see,
   therefore, that it is good to follow the angel of righteousness, but to
   bid farewell [196] to the angel of iniquity."

   "This commandment exhibits the deeds of faith, that you may trust the
   works of the angel of righteousness, and doing them you may live to
   God. But believe the works of the angel of iniquity are hard. If you
   refuse to do them, you will live to God."

    Commandment Seventh.

      On Fearing God, and Not Fearing the Devil.

   "Fear," said he, "the Lord, and keep His commandments. [197] For if you
   keep the commandments of God, you will be powerful in every action, and
   every one of your actions will be incomparable. For, fearing the Lord,
   you will do all things well. This is the fear which you ought to have,
   that you may be saved. But fear not the devil; for, fearing the Lord,
   you will have dominion over the devil, for there is no power in him.
   But he in whom there is no power ought on no account to be an object of
   fear; but He in whom there is glorious power is truly to be feared. For
   every one that has power ought to be feared; but he who has not power
   is despised by all. Fear, therefore, the deeds of the devil, since they
   are wicked. For, fearing the Lord, you will not do these deeds, but
   will refrain from them. For fears are of two kinds: [198] for if you do
   not wish to do that which is evil, fear the Lord, and you will not do
   it; but, again, if you wish to do that which is good, fear the Lord,
   and you will do it. Wherefore the fear of the Lord is strong, and
   great, and glorious. Fear, then, the Lord, and you will live to Him,
   and as many as fear Him and keep His commandments will live to God."
   "Why," [199] said I, "sir, did you say in regard to those that keep His
   commandments, that they will live to God?" "Because," says he, "all
   creation fears the Lord, but all creation does not keep His
   commandments. They only who fear the Lord and keep His commandments
   have life with God; [200] but as to those who keep not His
   commandments, there is no life in them."

    Commandment Eighth.

      We Ought to Shun that Which is Evil, and Do that Which is Good.

   "I told you," said he, "that the creatures of God are double, [201] for
   restraint also is double; for in some cases restraint has to be
   exercised, in others there is no need of restraint." "Make known to me,
   sir," say I, "in what cases restraint has to be exercised, and in what
   cases it has not." "Restrain yourself in regard to evil, and do it not;
   but exercise no restraint in regard to good, but do it. For if you
   exercise restraint in the doing of good, you will commit a great sin;
   [202] but if you exercise restraint, so as not to do that which is
   evil, you are practising great righteousness. Restrain yourself,
   therefore, from all iniquity, and do that which is good." "What, sir,"
   say I, "are the evil deeds from which we must restrain ourselves?"
   "Hear," says he: "from adultery and fornication, from unlawful
   revelling, [203] from wicked luxury, from indulgence in many kinds of
   food and the extravagance of riches, and from boastfulness, and
   haughtiness, and insolence, and lies, and backbiting, and hypocrisy,
   from the remembrance of wrong, and from all slander. These are the
   deeds that are most wicked in the life of men. From all these deeds,
   therefore, the servant of God must restrain himself. For he who does
   not restrain himself from these, cannot live to God. Listen, then, to
   the deeds that accompany these." "Are there, sir," said I, "any other
   evil deeds?" "There are," says he; "and many of them, too, from which
   the servant of God must restrain himself--theft, lying, robbery, false
   witness, overreaching, wicked lust, deceit, vainglory, boastfulness,
   and all other vices like to these." "Do you not think that these are
   really wicked?" "Exceedingly wicked in the servants of God. From all of
   these the servant of God must restrain himself. Restrain yourself,
   then, from all these, that you may live to God, and you will be
   enrolled amongst those who restrain themselves in regard to these
   matters. These, then, are the things from which you must restrain
   yourself."

   "But listen," says he, "to the things in regard to which you have not
   to exercise self-restraint, but which you ought to do. Restrain not
   yourself in regard to that which is good, but do it." "And tell me,
   sir," say I, "the nature of the good deeds, that I may walk in them and
   wait on them, so that doing them I can be saved." "Listen," says he,
   "to the good deeds which you ought to do, and in regard to which there
   is no self-restraint requisite. First of all [204] there is faith, then
   fear of the Lord, love, concord, words of righteousness, truth,
   patience. Than these, nothing is better in the life of men. If any one
   attend to these, and restrain himself not from them, blessed is he in
   his life. Then there are the following attendant on these: helping
   widows, looking after orphans and the needy, rescuing the servants of
   God from necessities, the being hospitable--for in hospitality
   good-doing finds a field--never opposing any one, the being quiet,
   having fewer needs than all men, reverencing the aged, practising
   righteousness, watching the brotherhood, bearing insolence, being
   long-suffering, encouraging those who are sick in soul, not casting
   those who have fallen into sin from the faith, but turning them back
   and restoring them to peace of mind, admonishing sinners, not
   oppressing debtors and the needy, and if there are any other actions
   like these. [205] Do these seem to you good?" says he. "For what, sir,"
   say I, "is better than these?" "Walk then in them," says he, "and
   restrain not yourself from them, and you will live to God. [206] Keep,
   therefore, this commandment. If you do good, and restrain not yourself
   from it, you will live to God. All who act thus will live to God. And,
   again, if you refuse to do evil, and restrain yourself from it, you
   will live to God. And all will live to God who keep these commandments,
   and walk in them."

    Commandment Ninth.

      Prayer Must Be Made to God Without Ceasing, and with Unwavering
      Confidence.

   He says to me, "Put away doubting from you and do not hesitate to ask
   of the Lord, saying to yourself, How can I ask of the Lord and receive
   from Him, seeing I have sinned so much against Him? Do not thus reason
   with yourself, but with all your heart turn to the Lord and ask of Him
   without doubting, and you will know the multitude of His tender
   mercies; that He will never leave you, but fulfil the request of your
   soul. For He is not like men, who remember evils done against them; but
   He Himself remembers not evils, and has compassion on His own creature.
   Cleanse, therefore, your heart from all the vanities of this world, and
   from the words already mentioned, and ask of the Lord and you will
   receive all, and in none of your requests will you be denied which you
   make to the Lord without doubting. But if you doubt in your heart, you
   will receive none of your requests. For those who doubt regarding God
   are double-souled, and obtain not one of their requests. [207] But
   those who are perfect in faith ask everything, trusting in the Lord;
   and they obtain, because they ask nothing doubting, and not being
   double-souled. For every double-souled man, even if he repent, will
   with difficulty be saved. [208] Cleanse your heart, therefore, from all
   doubt, and put on faith, because it is strong, and trust God that you
   will obtain from Him all that you ask. And if at any time, after you
   have asked of the Lord, you are slower in obtaining your request [than
   you expected], do not doubt because you have not soon obtained the
   request of your soul; for invariably it is on account of some
   temptation or some sin of which you are ignorant that you are slower in
   obtaining your request. Wherefore do not cease to make the request of
   your soul, and you will obtain it. But if you grow weary and waver in
   your request, blame yourself, and not Him who does not give to you.
   Consider this doubting state of mind, for it is wicked and senseless,
   and turns many away entirely from the faith, even though they be very
   strong. For this doubting is the daughter of the devil, and acts
   exceedingly wickedly to the servants of God. Despise, then, doubting,
   and gain the mastery over it in everything; clothing yourself with
   faith, which is strong and powerful. For faith promises all things,
   perfects all things; but doubt having no thorough faith in itself,
   fails in every work which it undertakes. You see, then," says he,
   "that, faith is from above--from the Lord [209] --and has great power;
   but doubt is an earthly spirit, coming from the devil, and has no
   power. Serve, then, that which has power, namely faith, and keep away
   from doubt, which has no power, and you will live to God. And all will
   live to God whose minds have been set on these things."

    Commandment Tenth.

      Of Grief, and Not Grieving the Spirit of God Which is in Us.

      Chap. I.

   "Remove from you," says he, "grief; for she is the sister of doubt and
   anger." "How, sir," say I, "is she the sister of these? for anger,
   doubt, and grief seem to be quite different from each other." "You are
   senseless, O man. Do you not perceive that grief is more wicked than
   all the spirits, and most terrible to the servants of God, and more
   than all other spirits destroys man and crushes out the Holy Spirit,
   and yet, on the other hand, she saves him?" "I am senseless, sir," say
   I, "and do not understand these parables. For how she can crush out,
   and on the other hand save, I do not perceive." "Listen," says he.
   "Those who have never searched for the truth, nor investigated the
   nature of the Divinity, but have simply believed, when they devote
   themselves to and become mixed up with business, and wealth, and
   heathen friendships, and many other actions of this world, [210] do not
   perceive the parables of Divinity; for their minds are darkened by
   these actions, and they are corrupted and become dried up. Even as
   beautiful vines, when they are neglected, are withered up by thorns and
   divers plants, so men who have believed, and have afterwards fallen
   away into many of those actions above mentioned, go astray in their
   minds, and lose all understanding in regard to righteousness; for if
   they hear of righteousness, their minds are occupied with their
   business, [211] and they give no heed at all. Those, on the other hand,
   who have the fear of God, and search after Godhead and truth, and have
   their hearts turned to the Lord, quickly perceive and understand what
   is said to them, because they have the fear of the Lord in them. For
   where the Lord dwells, there is much understanding. Cleave, then, to
   the Lord, and you will understand and perceive all things."

      Chap. II.

   "Hear, then," says he, "foolish man, how grief crushes out the Holy
   Spirit, and on the other hand saves. When the doubting man attempts any
   deed, and fails in it on account of his doubt, this grief enters into
   the man, and grieves the Holy Spirit, and crushes him out. Then, on the
   other hand, when anger attaches itself to a man in regard to any
   matter, and he is embittered, then grief enters into the heart of the
   man who was irritated, and he is grieved at the deed which he did, and
   repents that he has wrought a wicked deed. This grief, then, appears to
   be accompanied by salvation, because the man, after having done a
   wicked deed, repented. [212] Both actions grieve the Spirit: doubt,
   because it did not accomplish its object; and anger grieves the Spirit,
   because it did what was wicked. Both these are grievous to the Holy
   Spirit--doubt and anger. Wherefore remove grief from you, and crush not
   the Holy Spirit which dwells in you, lest he entreat God [213] against
   you, and he withdraw from you. For the Spirit of God which has been
   granted to us to dwell in this body does not endure grief nor
   straitness. Wherefore put on cheerfulness, which always is agreeable
   and acceptable to God, [214] and rejoice in it. For every cheerful man
   does what is good, and minds what is good, and despises grief; [215]
   but the sorrowful man always acts wickedly. First, he acts wickedly
   because he grieves the Holy Spirit, which was given to man a cheerful
   Spirit. Secondly, grieving the Holy Spirit, [216] he works iniquity,
   neither entreating the Lord nor confessing [217] to Him. For the
   entreaty of the sorrowful man has no power to ascend to the altar of
   God." "Why," say I, "does not the entreaty of the grieved man ascend to
   the altar?" "Because," says he, "grief sits in his heart. Grief, then,
   mingled with his entreaty, does not permit the entreaty to ascend pure
   to the altar of God. For as vinegar and wine, when mixed in the same
   vessel, do not give the same pleasure [as wine alone gives], so grief
   mixed with the Holy Spirit does not produce the same entreaty [as would
   be produced by the Holy Spirit alone]. Cleanse yourself from this
   wicked grief, and you will live to God; and all will live to God who
   drive away grief from them, and put on all cheerfulness." [218]

    Commandment Eleventh.

      The Spirit and Prophets to Be Tried by Their Works; Also of the Two Kinds
      of Spirit.

   He pointed out to me some men sitting on a seat, and one man sitting on
   a chair. And he says to me, "Do you see the persons sitting on the
   seat?" "I do, sir," said I. "These," says he, "are the faithful, and he
   who sits on the chair is a false prophet, ruining the minds of the
   servants of God. [219] It is the doubters, not the faithful, that he
   ruins. These doubters then go to him as to a soothsayer, and inquire of
   him what will happen to them; and he, the false prophet, not having the
   power of a Divine Spirit in him, answers them according to their
   inquiries, and according to their wicked desires, and fills their souls
   with expectations, according to their own wishes. For being himself
   empty, he gives empty answers to empty inquirers; for every answer is
   made to the emptiness of man. Some true words he does occasionally
   utter; for the devil fills him with his own spirit, in the hope that he
   may be able to overcome some of the righteous. As many, then, as are
   strong in the faith of the Lord, and are clothed with truth, have no
   connection with such spirits, but keep away from them; but as many as
   are of doubtful minds and frequently repent, betake themselves to
   soothsaying, even as the heathen, and bring greater sin upon themselves
   by their idolatry. For he who inquires of a false prophet in regard to
   any action is an idolater, and devoid of the truth, and foolish. For no
   spirit given by God requires to be asked; but such a spirit having the
   power of Divinity speaks all things of itself, for it proceeds from
   above from the power of the Divine Spirit. But the spirit which is
   asked and speaks according to the desires of men is earthly, [220]
   light, and powerless, and it is altogether silent if it is not
   questioned." "How then, sir," say I, "will a man know which of them is
   the prophet, and which the false prophet?" "I will tell you," says he,
   "about both the prophets, and then you can try the true and the false
   prophet according to my directions. Try the man who has the Divine
   Spirit by his life. First, he who has the Divine Spirit proceeding from
   above is meek, and peaceable, and humble, and refrains from all
   iniquity and the vain desire of this world, and contents himself with
   fewer wants than those of other men, and when asked he makes no reply;
   nor does he speak privately, nor when man wishes the spirit to speak
   does the Holy Spirit speak, but it speaks only when God wishes it to
   speak. When, then, a man having the Divine Spirit comes into an
   assembly of righteous men who have faith in the Divine Spirit, and this
   assembly of men offers up prayer to God, then the angel of the
   prophetic Spirit, [221] who is destined for him, fills the man; and the
   man being filled with the Holy Spirit, speaks to the multitude as the
   Lord wishes. Thus, then, will the Spirit of Divinity become manifest.
   Whatever power therefore comes from the Spirit of Divinity belongs to
   the Lord. Hear, then," says he, "in regard to the spirit which is
   earthly, and empty, and powerless, and foolish. First, the man [222]
   who seems to have the Spirit exalts himself, and wishes to have the
   first seat, and is bold, and impudent, and talkative, and lives in the
   midst of many luxuries and many other delusions, and takes rewards for
   his prophecy; and if he does not receive rewards, he does not prophesy.
   Can, then, the Divine Spirit take rewards and prophesy? It is not
   possible that the prophet of God should do this, but prophets of this
   character are possessed by an earthly spirit. Then it never approaches
   an assembly of righteous men, but shuns them. And it associates with
   doubters and the vain, and prophesies to them in a corner, and deceives
   them, speaking to them, according to their desires, mere empty words:
   for they are empty to whom it gives its answers. For the empty vessel,
   when placed along with the empty, is not crushed, but they correspond
   to each other. When, therefore, it comes into an assembly of righteous
   men who have a Spirit of Divinity, and they offer up prayer, that man
   is made empty, and the earthly spirit flees from him through fear, and
   that man is made dumb, and is entirely crushed, being unable to speak.
   For if you pack closely a storehouse with wine or oil, and put an empty
   jar in the midst of the vessels of wine or oil, you will find that jar
   empty as when you placed it, if you should wish to clear the
   storehouse. So also the empty prophets, when they come to the spirits
   of the righteous, are found [on leaving] to be such as they were when
   they came. This, then, is the mode of life of both prophets. Try by his
   deeds and his life the man who says that he is inspired. But as for
   you, trust the Spirit which comes from God, and has power; but the
   spirit which is earthly and empty trust not at all, for there is no
   power in it: it comes from the devil. Hear, then, the parable which I
   am to tell you. Take a stone, and throw it to the sky, and see if you
   can touch it. Or again, take a squirt of water and squirt into the sky,
   and see if you can penetrate the sky." "How, sir," say I, "can these
   things take place? for both of them are impossible." "As these things,"
   says he, "are impossible, so also are the earthly spirits powerless and
   pithless. But look, on the other hand, at the power which comes from
   above. Hail is of the size of a very small grain, yet when it falls on
   a man's head how much annoyance it gives him! Or, again, take the drop
   which falls from a pitcher to the ground, and yet it hollows a stone.
   [223] You see, then, that the smallest things coming from above have
   great power when they fall upon the earth. [224] Thus also is the
   Divine Spirit, which comes from above, powerful. Trust, then, that
   Spirit, but have nothing to do with the other."

    Commandment Twelfth.

      On the Twofold Desire. The Commandments of God Can Be Kept, and Believers
      Ought Not to Fear the Devil.

      Chap. I.

   He says to me, "Put away from you all wicked desire, and clothe
   yourself with good and chaste desire; for clothed with this desire you
   will hate wicked desire, [225] and will rein yourself in even as you
   wish. For wicked desire is wild, and is with difficulty tamed. For it
   is terrible, and consumes men exceedingly by its wildness. Especially
   is the servant of God terribly consumed by it, if he falls into it and
   is devoid of understanding. Moreover, it consumes all such as have not
   on them the garment of good desire, but are entangled and mixed up with
   this world. These it delivers up to death." "What then, sir," say I,
   "are the deeds of wicked desire which deliver men over to death? Make
   them known to me, and I will refrain from them." "Listen, then, to the
   works in which evil desire slays the servants of God." [226]

      Chap. II.

   "Foremost of all is the desire after another's wife or husband, and
   after extravagance, and many useless dainties and drinks, and many
   other foolish luxuries; for all luxury is foolish and empty in the
   servants of God. These, then, are the evil desires which slay the
   servants of God. For this evil desire is the daughter of the devil. You
   must refrain from evil desires, that by refraining ye may live to God.
   [227] But as many as are mastered by them, and do not resist them, will
   perish at last, for these desires are fatal. Put you on, then, the
   desire of righteousness; and arming yourself with the fear of the Lord,
   resist them. For the fear of the Lord dwells in good desire. But if
   evil desire see you armed with the fear of God, [228] and resisting it,
   it will flee far from you, and it will no longer appear to you, for it
   fears your armour. Go, then, garlanded with the crown which you have
   gained for victory over it, to the desire of righteousness, and,
   delivering up to it the prize which you have received, serve it even as
   it wishes. [229] If you serve good desire, and be subject to it, you
   will gain the mastery over evil desire, and make it subject to you even
   as you wish." [230]

      Chap. III.

   "I should like to know," say I, "in what way I ought to serve good
   desire." "Hear," says he: "You will practice righteousness and virtue,
   truth and the fear of the Lord, faith and meekness, and whatsoever
   excellences are like to these. Practising these, you will be a
   well-pleasing servant of God, [231] and you will live to Him; and every
   one who shall serve good desire, shall live to God."

   He concluded the twelve commandments, and said to me, "You have now
   these commandments. Walk in them, and exhort your hearers that their
   repentance may be pure during the remainder of their life. Fulfil
   carefully this ministry which I now entrust to you, and you will
   accomplish much. [232] For you will find favour among those who are to
   repent, and they will give heed to your words; for I will be with you,
   and will compel them to obey you." I say to him, "Sir, these
   commandments are great, and good, and glorious, and fitted to gladden
   the heart of the man who can perform them. But I do not know if these
   commandments can be kept by man, because they are exceeding hard." He
   answered and said to me, "If you lay it down as certain that they can
   be kept, [233] then you will easily keep them, and they will not be
   hard. But if you come to imagine that they cannot be kept by man, then
   you will not keep them. Now I say to you, If you do not keep them, but
   neglect them, you will not be saved, nor your children, nor your house,
   since you have already determined for yourself that these commandments
   cannot be kept by man."

      Chap. IV.

   These things he said to me in tones of the deepest anger, so that I was
   confounded and exceedingly afraid of him, for his figure was altered so
   that a man could not endure his anger. But seeing me altogether
   agitated and confused, he began to speak to me in more gentle tones;
   and he said: "O fool, senseless and doubting, do you not perceive how
   great is the glory of God, and how strong and marvellous, in that He
   created the world for the sake of man, [234] and subjected all creation
   to him, and gave him power to rule over everything under heaven? If,
   then, man is lord of the creatures of God, and rules over all, is he
   not able to be lord also of these commandments? For," says he, "the man
   who has the Lord in his heart can also be lord of all, and of every one
   of these commandments. But to those who have the Lord only on their
   lips, [235] but their hearts hardened, [236] and who are far from the
   Lord, the commandments are hard and difficult. Put, therefore, ye who
   are empty and fickle in your faith, the Lord in your heart, and ye will
   know that there is nothing easier or sweeter, or more manageable, than
   these commandments. Return, ye who walk in the commandments of the
   devil, in hard, and bitter, and wild licentiousness, and fear not the
   devil; for there is no power in him against you, for I will be with
   you, the angel of repentance, who am lord over him. The devil has fear
   only, but his fear has no strength. [237] Fear him not, then, and he
   will flee from you."

      Chap. V.

   I say to him, "Sir, listen to me for a moment." "Say what you wish,"
   says he. "Man, sir," say I, "is eager to keep the commandments of God,
   and there is no one who does not ask of the Lord that strength may be
   given him for these commandments, and that he may be subject to them;
   but the devil is hard, and holds sway over them." "He cannot," says he,
   "hold sway over the servants of God, who with all their heart place
   their hopes in Him. The devil can wrestle against these, overthrow them
   he cannot. If, then, ye resist him, he will be conquered, and flee in
   disgrace from you. As many, therefore," says he, "as are empty, fear
   the devil, as possessing power. When a man has filled very suitable
   jars with good wine, and a few among those jars are left empty, [238]
   then he comes to the jars, and does not look at the full jars, for he
   knows that they are full; but he looks at the empty, being afraid lest
   they have become sour. For empty jars quickly become sour, and the
   goodness of the wine is gone. So also the devil goes to all the
   servants of God to try them. As many, then, as are full in the faith,
   resist him strongly, and he withdraws from them, having no way by which
   he might enter them. He goes, then, to the empty, and finding a way of
   entrance, into them, he produces in them whatever he wishes, and they
   become his servants." [239]

      Chap. VI.

   "But I, the angel of repentance, say to you, Fear not the devil; for I
   was sent," says he, "to be with you who repent with all your heart, and
   to make you strong in faith. Trust God, [240] then, ye who on account
   of your sins have despaired of life, and who add to your sins and weigh
   down your life; for if ye return to the Lord with all your heart, and
   practice righteousness the rest of your days, [241] and serve Him
   according to His will, He will heal your former sins, and you will have
   power to hold sway over the works of the devil. But as to the threats
   of the devil, fear them not at all, for he is powerless as the sinews
   of a dead man. Give ear to me, then, and fear Him who has all power,
   both to save and destroy, [242] and keep His commandments, and ye will
   live to God." I say to him, "Sir, I am now made strong in all the
   ordinances of the Lord, because you are with me; and I know that you
   will crush all the power of the devil, and we shall have rule over him,
   and shall prevail against all his works. And I hope, sir, to be able to
   keep all these commandments [243] which you have enjoined upon me, the
   Lord strengthening me." "You will keep them," says he, "if your heart
   be pure towards the Lord; and all will keep them who cleanse their
   hearts from the vain desires of this world, and they will live to God."

    Similitude First. [244]

      As in This World We Have No Abiding City, We Ought to Seek One to Come.

   He says to me, "You know that you who are the servants of God dwell in
   a strange land; for your city is far away from this one. [245] If,
   then," he continues, "you know your city in which you are to dwell, why
   do ye here provide lands, and make expensive preparations, and
   accumulate dwellings and useless buildings? He who makes such
   preparations for this city cannot return again to his own. Oh foolish,
   and unstable, and miserable man! Dost thou not understand that all
   these things belong to another, and are under the power of another? For
   the Lord of this city will say, I do not wish thee to dwell in my city;
   but depart from this city, because thou obeyest not my laws.' Thou,
   therefore, although having fields and houses, and many other things,
   when cast out by him, what wilt thou do with thy land, and house, and
   other possessions which thou hast gathered to thyself? For the Lord of
   this country justly says to thee, Either obey my laws or depart from my
   dominion.' What, then, dost thou intend to do, having a law in thine
   own city, on account of thy lands, and the rest of thy possessions?
   [246] Thou shalt altogether deny thy law, and walk according to the law
   of this city. See lest it be to thy hurt to deny thy law; [247] for if
   thou shalt desire to return to thy city, thou wilt not be received,
   because thou hast denied the law of thy city, but wilt be excluded from
   it. Have a care, therefore: as one living in a foreign land, make no
   further preparations for thyself than such merely as may be sufficient;
   and be ready, when the master of this city shall come to cast thee out
   for disobeying his law, to leave his city, and to depart to thine own,
   and to obey thine own law without being exposed to annoyance, but in
   great joy. Have a care, then, ye who serve the Lord, and have Him in
   your heart, that ye work the works of God, remembering His commandments
   and promises which He promised, and believe that He will bring them to
   pass if His commandments be observed. Instead of lands, therefore, buy
   afflicted souls, according as each one is able, and visit [248] widows
   and orphans, and do not overlook them; and spend your wealth and all
   your preparations, which ye received from the Lord, upon such lands and
   houses. For to this end did the Master make you rich, that you might
   perform these services unto Him; and it is much better to purchase such
   lands, and possessions, and houses, as you will find in your own city,
   when you come to reside in it. This is a noble and sacred expenditure,
   attended neither with sorrow nor fear, but with joy. Do not practice
   the expenditure of the heathen, [249] for it is injurious to you who
   are the servants of God; but practice an expenditure of your own, in
   which ye can rejoice; and do not corrupt [250] nor touch what is
   another's nor covet it, for it is an evil thing to covet the goods of
   other men; but work thine own work, and thou wilt be saved."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [244] [We have seen in Justin and Irenæus what seem to us an
   overstrained allegorizing, and more will be encountered in Origen. On
   this whole subject, however, as it struck the Oriental and primitive
   instincts, take the following very illustrative remarks, attributed to
   Hartley of Winwich:-- "Nature, in its proper order, is the book of God,
   and exhibits spiritual things in material forms. The knowledge of
   correspondences being so little understood, is one main cause of the
   obscurity of the Scriptures of the Old Testament, which were chiefly
   written by the rules of this science: and not Scripture alone, but man,
   also, as an image of the spiritual and natural worlds, contains in
   himself the correspondences of both: of the former, in his interior,
   and of the latter in his exterior or bodily, part, and so is called the
   microcosm, or little world." Such texts as Heb. ix. 24, 1 Cor. ii. 13,
   14, go far to explain to us the childlike faith of the Fathers. See
   note on Leighton's St. Peter, p. 238, vol. iii. Ed. Of William West,
   B.A. 1870.]

   [245] [Heb. xiii. 14 is the text of this very beautiful chapter. But he
   original Greek of Phil. iii. 20 seems, also, to be in the author's
   mind. St. Paul addressed it to the church of a Roman "colony," whose
   citizenship was not Macedonian but Roman: hence its beautiful
   propriety.]

   [246] This sentence may be also rendered thus, giving heneken the
   meaning of "as regards," "respecting"--a usual enough signification:
   "What then do you intend to do, as you have a law in your own city
   regarding your lands and the rest of your possessions?" The Vatican
   punctuates the passage so that it runs as follows: "What then will you
   do, who have a law in your own city? Will you, on account of your land,
   or any other of your preparations, be able to deny your law?" The
   Vatican also omits several clauses that are in the Greek, down to "for
   if thou shalt deny, and shalt desire to return," etc.

   [247] See ... law, omitted in Lips. [The threskeia of Jas. i. 27.]

   [248] The Vatican has: "Acquit widows, and do justice to orphans."

   [249] The Vatican renders, "Do not covet, therefore, the riches of the
   heathen." [Here follows, in the Lambeth ms., an allusion to Luke xix.
   15, which Wake renders: "Trade with your own riches." See, also, Luke
   xii. 33.]

   [250] The Vatican, rendering paracharassete, adulterare, proceeds as if
   the reference were to adultery. "Neither touch another man's wife, nor
   lust after her, but desire your own work, and you will be saved."
     __________________________________________________________________

    Similitude Second.

      As the Vine is Supported by the Elm, So is the Rich Man Helped by the
      Prayer of the Poor.

   As I was walking in the field, and observing an elm and vine, and
   determining in my own mind respecting them and their fruits, the
   Shepherd appears to me, and says, "What is it that you are thinking
   about the elm and vine?" "I am considering," I reply, "that they become
   each other exceedingly well." "These two trees," he continues, "are
   intended as an example for the servants of God." "I would like to
   know," said I, "the example which these trees you say, are intended to
   teach." "Do you see," he says, "the elm and the vine?" "I see them
   sir," I replied. "This vine," he continued, "produces fruit, and the
   elm is an unfruitful tree; but unless the vine be trained upon the elm,
   it cannot bear much fruit when extended at length upon the ground;
   [251] and the fruit which it does bear is rotten, because the plant is
   not suspended upon the elm. When, therefore, the vine is cast upon the
   elm, it yields fruit both from itself and from the elm. You see,
   moreover, that the elm also produces much fruit, not less than the
   vine, but even more; because," [252] he continued, "the vine, when
   suspended upon the elm, yields much fruit, and good; but when thrown
   upon the ground, what it produces is small and rotten. This similitude,
   [253] therefore, is for the servants of God--for the poor man and for
   the rich." "How so, sir?" said I; "explain the matter to me." "Listen,"
   he said: "The rich man has much wealth, but is poor in matters relating
   to the Lord, because he is distracted about his riches; and he offers
   very few confessions and intercessions to the Lord, and those which he
   does offer are small and weak, and have no power above. But when the
   rich man refreshes [254] the poor, and assists him in his necessities,
   believing that what he does to the poor man will be able to find its
   reward with God--because the poor man is rich in intercession and
   confession, and his intercession has great power with God--then the
   rich man helps the poor in all things without hesitation; and the poor
   man, being helped by the rich, intercedes for him, giving thanks to God
   for him who bestows gifts upon him. And he still continues to interest
   himself zealously for the poor man, that his wants may be constantly
   supplied. For he knows that the intercession of the poor man is
   acceptable and influential [255] with God. Both, accordingly,
   accomplish their work. The poor man makes intercession; a work in which
   he is rich, which he received from the Lord, and with which he
   recompenses the master who helps him. And the rich man, in like manner,
   unhesitatingly bestows upon the poor man the riches which he received
   from the Lord. And this is a great work, and acceptable before God,
   because he understands the object of his wealth, and has given to the
   poor of the gifts of the Lord, and rightly discharged his service to
   Him. [256] Among men, however, the elm appears not to produce fruit,
   and they do not know nor understand that if a drought come, the elm,
   which contains water, nourishes the vine; and the vine, having an
   unfailing supply of water, yields double fruit both for itself and for
   the elm. So also poor men interceding with the Lord on behalf of the
   rich, increase their riches; and the rich, again, aiding the poor in
   their necessities, satisfy their souls. Both, therefore, are partners
   in the righteous work. He who does these things shall not be deserted
   by God, but shall be enrolled in the books of the living. Blessed are
   they who have riches, and who understand that they are from the Lord.
   [For they who are of that mind will be able to do some good. [257] ]"
     __________________________________________________________________

   [251] The Vatican reads: "Unless this vine be attached to the elm, and
   rest upon it, it cannot bear much fruit. For, lying upon the ground, it
   produces bad fruit, because it is not suspended upon the elm."

   [252] The Vatican here makes Hermas interrupt the Shepherd, and ask,
   "How greater than the vine?"

   [253] [Based on Jas. i. 9-11, 27, and ii. 1-9: introducing the heathen
   world to just ideas of human brotherhood, and the mutual relations of
   the poor and the rich.]

   [254] The translation of the text is based on the Palatine. Lips.
   Reads: "When the rich man fills out upon the poor." Hilgenfeld amends
   this: "When the rich man recovers breath upon the poor." Neither gives
   sense. The Æthiopic has: "But if the rich man lean on the poor;" and
   the Greek of Hilgenfeld might mean: "When the rich man recovers his
   breath by leaning on the poor." The Vatican is quite different: "When,
   therefore, the rich man helps the poor in those things which he needs,
   the poor man prays to the Lord for the rich man, and God bestows all
   blessings upon the rich man, because the poor man is rich in prayer,
   and his prayer has great merit with God. Then the rich man accordingly
   assists the poor man's things, because he feels that he is fully heard
   (exaudiri) by the Lord; and the more willingly and unhesitatingly does
   he give him every help, and takes care that he wants for nothing. The
   poor man gives thanks to God for the rich man, because they do their
   duty in respect to the Lord (a Domino)."

   [255] [I note this use of the word "influential," because it was
   formerly denounced as an Americanism.]

   [256] [Luke xii. 42.]

   [257] The sentence in brackets is not in Lips. It is taken from Pal.

    Similitude Third.

      As in Winter Green Trees Cannot Be Distinguished from Withered, So in This
      World Neither Can the Just from the Unjust.

   He showed me many trees having no leaves, but withered, as it seemed to
   me; for all were alike. And he said to me, "Do you see those trees?" "I
   see, sir," I replied, "that all are alike, and withered." He answered
   me, and said, "These trees which you see are those who dwell in this
   world." "Why, then, sir," I said, "are they withered, as it were, and
   alike?" [258] "Because," he said, "neither are the righteous manifest
   in this life, nor sinners, but they are alike; for this life is a
   winter to the righteous, and they do not manifest themselves, because
   they dwell with sinners: for as in winter trees that have cast their
   leaves are alike, and it is not seen which are dead and which are
   living, so in this world neither do the righteous show themselves, nor
   sinners, but all are alike one to another." [259]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [258] The Vatican renders this thus: "Why do they resemble those that
   are, as it were, withered?"

    Similitude Fourth.

      As in Summer Living Trees are Distinguished from Withered by Fruit and
      Living Leaves, So in the World to Come the Just Differ from the Unjust in
      Happiness.

   He showed me again many trees, some budding, and others withered. And
   he said to me, "Do you see these trees?" "I see, sir," I replied, "some
   putting forth buds, and others withered." "Those," he said, "which are
   budding are the righteous who are to live in the world to come; for the
   coming world is the summer [260] of the righteous, but the winter of
   sinners. When, therefore, the mercy of the Lord shines forth, then
   shall they be made manifest who are the servants of God, and all men
   shall be made manifest. For as in summer the fruits of each individual
   tree appear, and it is ascertained of what sort they are, so also the
   fruits of the righteous shall be manifest, and all who have been
   fruitful in that world shall be made known. [261] But the heathen and
   sinners, like the withered trees which you saw, will be found to be
   those who have been withered and unfruitful in that world, and shall be
   burnt as wood, and [so] made manifest, because their actions were evil
   during their lives. For the sinners shall be consumed because they
   sinned and did not repent, and the heathen shall be burned because they
   knew not Him who created them. Do you therefore bear fruit, that in
   that summer your fruit may be known. And refrain from much business,
   and you will never sin: for they who are occupied with much business
   commit also many sins, being distracted about their affairs, and not at
   all serving their Lord. [262] How, then," he continued, "can such a one
   ask and obtain anything from the Lord, if he serve Him not? They who
   serve Him shall obtain their requests, but they who serve Him not shall
   receive nothing. And in the performance even of a single action a man
   can serve the Lord; for his mind will not be perverted from the Lord,
   but he will serve Him, having a pure mind. If, therefore, you do these
   things, you shall be able to bear fruit for the life to come. And every
   one who will do these things shall bear fruit."

    Similitude Fifth.

      Of True Fasting and Its Reward: Also of Purity of Body.

      Chap. I.

   While fasting and sitting on a certain mountain, and giving thanks to
   the Lord for all His dealings with me, I see the Shepherd sitting down
   beside me, and saying, "Why have you come hither [so] early in the
   morning?" "Because, sir," I answered, "I have a station." [263] "What
   is a station?" he asked. "I am fasting, sir," I replied. "What is this
   fasting," he continued, "which you are observing?" "As I have been
   accustomed, sir," I reply, "so I fast." "You do not know," he says,
   "how to fast unto the Lord: this useless fasting which you observe to
   Him is of no value." "Why, sir," I answered, "do you say this?" "I say
   to you," he continued, "that the fasting which you think you observe is
   not a fasting. But I will teach you what is a full and acceptable
   fasting to the Lord. Listen," he continued: "God does not desire such
   an empty fasting. [264] For fasting to God in this way you will do
   nothing for a righteous life; but offer to God a fasting of the
   following kind: Do no evil in your life, and serve the Lord with a pure
   heart: keep His commandments, walking in His precepts, and let no evil
   desire arise in your heart; and believe in God. If you do these things,
   and fear Him, and abstain from every evil thing, you will live unto
   God; and if you do these things, you will keep a great fast, and one
   acceptable before God."

      Chap. II.

   "Hear the similitude which I am about to narrate to you relative to
   fasting. A certain man had a field and many slaves, and he planted a
   certain part of the field with a vineyard, [265] and selecting a
   faithful and beloved and much valued slave, he called him to him, and
   said, Take this vineyard which I have planted, and stake [266] it until
   I come, and do nothing else to the vineyard; and attend to this order
   of mine, and you shall receive your freedom from me.' And the master of
   the slave departed to a foreign country. And when he was gone, the
   slave took and staked the vineyard; and when he had finished the
   staking of the vines, he saw that the vineyard was full of weeds. He
   then reflected, saying, I have kept this order of my master: I will dig
   up the rest of this vineyard, and it will be more beautiful when dug
   up; and being free of weeds, it will yield more fruit, not being choked
   by them.' He took, therefore, and dug up the vineyard, and rooted out
   all the weeds that were in it. And that vineyard became very beautiful
   and fruitful, having no weeds to choke it. And after a certain time the
   master of the slave and of the field returned, and entered into the
   vineyard. And seeing that the vines were suitably supported on stakes,
   and the ground, moreover, dug up, and all the weeds rooted out, and the
   vines fruitful, he was greatly pleased with the work of his slave. And
   calling his beloved son who was his heir, and his friends who were his
   councillors, he told them what orders he had given his slave, and what
   he had found performed. And they rejoiced along with the slave at the
   testimony which his master bore to him. And he said to them, I promised
   this slave freedom if he obeyed the command which I gave him; and he
   has kept my command, and done besides a good work to the vineyard, and
   has pleased me exceedingly. In return, therefore, for the work which he
   has done, I wish to make him co-heir with my son, because, having good
   thoughts, he did not neglect them, but carried them out.' With this
   resolution of the master his son and friends were well pleased, viz.,
   that the slave should be co-heir with the son. After a few days the
   master made a feast, [267] and sent to his slave many dishes from his
   table. And the slave receiving the dishes that were sent him from his
   master, took of them what was sufficient for himself, and distributed
   the rest among his fellow-slaves. And his fellow-slaves rejoiced to
   receive the dishes, and began to pray for him, that he might find still
   greater favour with his master for having so treated them. His master
   heard all these things that were done, and was again greatly pleased
   with his conduct. And the master again calling together his friends and
   his son, reported to them the slave's proceeding with regard to the
   dishes which he had sent him. And they were still more satisfied that
   the slave should become co-heir with his son."

      Chap. III.

   I said to him, "Sir, I do not see the meaning of these similitudes, nor
   am I able to comprehend them, unless you explain them to me." "I will
   explain them all to you," he said, "and whatever I shall mention in the
   course of our conversations I will show you. [Keep the commandments of
   the Lord, and you will be approved, and inscribed amongst the number of
   those who observe His commands.] And if you do any good beyond what is
   commanded by God, [268] you will gain for yourself more abundant glory,
   and will be more honoured by God than you would otherwise be. If,
   therefore, in keeping the commandments of God, you do, in addition,
   these services, you will have joy if you observe them according to my
   command." I said to him, "Sir, whatsoever you enjoin upon me I will
   observe, for I know that you are with me." "I will be with you," he
   replied, "because you have such a desire for doing good; and I will be
   with all those," he added, "who have such a desire. This fasting," he
   continued, "is very good, provided the commandments of the Lord be
   observed. Thus, then, shall you observe the fasting which you intend to
   keep. [269] First of all, [270] be on your guard against every evil
   word, and every evil desire, and purify your heart from all the
   vanities of this world. If you guard against these things, your fasting
   will be perfect. And you will do also as follows. [271] Having
   fulfilled what is written, in the day on which you fast you will taste
   nothing but bread and water; and having reckoned up the price of the
   dishes of that day which you intended to have eaten, you will give it
   to a widow, or an orphan, or to some person in want, and thus you will
   exhibit humility of mind, so that he who has received benefit from your
   humility may fill his own soul, and pray for you to the Lord. If you
   observe fasting, as I have commanded you, your sacrifice will be
   acceptable to God, and this fasting will be written down; and the
   service thus performed is noble, and sacred, and acceptable to the
   Lord. These things, therefore, shall you thus observe with your
   children, and all your house, and in observing them you will be
   blessed; and as many as hear these words and observe them shall be
   blessed; and whatsoever they ask of the Lord they shall receive."

      Chap. IV.

   I prayed him much that he would explain to me the similitude of the
   field, and of the master of the vineyard, and of the slave who staked
   the vineyard, and of the stakes, and of the weeds that were plucked out
   of the vineyard, and of the son, and of the friends who were
   fellow-councillors, for I knew that all these things were a kind of
   parable. And he answered me, and said, "You are exceedingly persistent
   [272] with your questions. You ought not," he continued, "to ask any
   questions at all; for if it is needful to explain anything, it will be
   made known to you." I said to him, "Sir, whatsoever you show me, and do
   not explain, I shall have seen to no purpose, not understanding its
   meaning. In like manner, also, if you speak parables to me, and do not
   unfold them, I shall have heard your words in vain." And he answered me
   again, saying, "Every one who is the servant of God, and has his Lord
   in his heart, asks of Him understanding, and receives it, and opens up
   every parable; and the words of the Lord become known to him which are
   spoken in parables. [273] But those who are weak and slothful in
   prayer, hesitate to ask anything from the Lord; but the Lord is full of
   compassion, and gives without fail to all who ask Him. But you, having
   been strengthened by the holy Angel, [274] and having obtained from Him
   such intercession, and not being slothful, why do not you ask of the
   Lord understanding, and receive it from Him?" I said to him, "Sir,
   having you with me, I am necessitated to ask questions of you, for you
   show me all things, and converse with me; but if I were to see or hear
   these things without you, I would then ask the Lord to explain them."

      Chap. V.

   "I said to you a little ago," he answered, "that you were cunning and
   obstinate in asking explanations of the parables; but since you are so
   persistent, I shall unfold to you the meaning of the similitudes of the
   field, and of all the others that follow, that you may make them known
   to every one. [275] Hear now," he said, "and understand them. The field
   is this world; and the Lord of the field is He who created, and
   perfected, and strengthened all things; [and the son is the Holy
   Spirit; [276] ] and the slave is the Son of God; and the vines are this
   people, whom He Himself planted; and the stakes are the holy angels of
   the Lord, who keep His people together; and the weeds that were plucked
   out of the vineyard are the iniquities of God's servants; and the
   dishes which He sent Him from His table are the commandments which He
   gave His people through His Son; and the friends and fellow-councillors
   are the holy angels who were first created; and the Master's absence
   from home is the time that remains until His appearing." I said to him,
   "Sir, all these are great, and marvellous, and glorious things. Could
   I, therefore," I continued, "understand them? No, nor could any other
   man, even if exceedingly wise. Moreover," I added, "explain to me what
   I am about to ask you." "Say what you wish," he replied. "Why, sir," I
   asked, "is the Son of God in the parable in the form of a slave?"

      Chap. VI.

   "Hear," he answered: "the Son of God is not in the form [277] of a
   slave, but in great power and might." "How so, sir?" I said; "I do not
   understand." "Because," he answered, "God planted the vineyard, that is
   to say, He created the people, and gave them to His Son; and the Son
   appointed His angels over them to keep them; and He Himself purged away
   their sins, having suffered many trials and undergone many labours, for
   no one is able to dig without labour and toil. He Himself, then, having
   purged away the sins of the people, showed them the paths of life [278]
   by giving them the law which He received from His Father. [You see," he
   said, "that He is the Lord of the people, having received all authority
   from His Father. [279] ] And why the Lord took His Son as councillor,
   and the glorious angels, regarding the heirship of the slave, listen.
   The holy, pre-existent Spirit, that created every creature, God made to
   dwell in flesh, which He chose. [280] This flesh, accordingly, in which
   the Holy Spirit dwelt, was nobly subject to that Spirit, walking
   religiously and chastely, in no respect defiling the Spirit; and
   accordingly, after living [281] excellently and purely, and after
   labouring and co-operating with the Spirit, and having in everything
   acted vigorously and courageously along with the Holy Spirit, He
   assumed it as a partner with it. For this conduct [282] of the flesh
   pleased Him, because it was not defiled on the earth while having the
   Holy Spirit. He took, therefore, as fellow-councillors His Son and the
   glorious angels, in order that this flesh, which had been subject to
   the body without a fault, might have some place of tabernacle, and that
   it might not appear that the reward [of its servitude had been lost
   [283] ], for the flesh that has been found without spot or defilement,
   in which the Holy Spirit dwelt, [will receive a reward [284] ]. You
   have now the explanation [285] of this parable also."

      Chap. VII.

   "I rejoice, sir," I said, "to hear this explanation." "Hear," again he
   replied: "Keep this flesh pure and stainless, that the Spirit which
   inhabits it may bear witness to it, and your flesh may be justified.
   See that the thought never arise in your mind that this flesh of yours
   is corruptible, and you misuse it by any act of defilement. If you
   defile your flesh, you will also defile the Holy Spirit; and if you
   defile your flesh [and spirit], you will not live." [286] "And if any
   one, sir," I said, "has been hitherto ignorant, before he heard these
   words, how can such a man be saved who has defiled his flesh?"
   "Respecting former sins [287] of ignorance," he said, "God alone is
   able to heal them, for to Him belongs all power. [But be on your guard
   now, and the all-powerful and compassionate God will heal former
   transgressions [288] ], if for the time to come you defile not your
   body nor your spirit; for both are common, and cannot be defiled, the
   one without the other: keep both therefore pure, and you will live unto
   God."

   [263] [This anachronism betrays the later origin of "The Pastor." The
   Pauline Hermas would not have used this technical term. These fasts
   were very early fixed by canon for Wednesdays and Fridays. See Canon
   lxix. of canons called "Apostolical;" also Bingham, book xiii. cap. 9,
   and this volume, p. 34, note 4.]

   gospel parables of the vineyard, and of the sower, and of the man
   travelling into a far country, are here reflected passim. I cannot but
   refer to a parable which greatly resembles this, and is yet more
   beautiful, occurring in Mrs. Sherwood's Stories on the Catechism
   (Fijou), a book for children. It is not unworthy of Bunyan.]

   [268] [To read into this passage the idea of "supererogatory merit" is
   an unpardonable anachronism. (Compare Command. iv. 4.) The writer
   everywhere denies human merit, extols mercy, and imputes good works to
   grace. He has in view St. Paul's advice (1 Cor. vii. 25-28), or our
   blessed Lord's saying (Matt. xix. 12). The abuse of such Scriptures
   propped up a false system (2 Pet. iii. 16) after it had been invented
   by Pelagians and monastic enthusiasts. But it has no place in the mind
   of Hermas, nor in the mind of Christ.]

   [269] [Thus he does not object to the "station," if kept with
   evangelical acts of devotion and penitence. Isa. lviii. 5-8.]

   [270] Pseudo-Athanasius gives this paragraph as follows: "First of all
   be on your guard to fast from every evil word and evil report, and
   purify your heart from every defilement and revenge, and base
   covetousness. And on the day on which you fast, be content with bread,
   and herbs, and water, giving thanks to God. And having calculated the
   amount of the cost of the meal which you intended to have eaten on that
   day, give it to a widow, or an orphan, or to some one in want, so that,
   having clearly filled his own soul, he shall pray to the Lord on your
   behalf. If you therefore perform your fasting as I enjoined you, your
   sacrifice will be acceptable before the Lord, and inscribed in the
   heavens in the day of the requital of the good things that have been
   prepared for the righteous."

   [271] [Note this detailed account of primitive fasting (2 Cor. vi. 5,
   ix. 27, xi. 27). Amid all the apostle's sufferings and dying daily, he

   [280] This passage varies in each of the forms in which it has come
   down, and is corrupt in most, if not in all. The Vatican (Lat.) has,
   "Because the messenger hears the Holy Spirit, which was the first of
   all that was poured (infusus) into a body in which God might dwell. For
   understanding (intellectus) placed it in a body as seemed proper to
   Him." The Pal. reads: "For that Holy Spirit which was created pure
   [first] of all in a body in which it might dwell, God made and
   appointed a chosen body which pleased Him." The Æth. reads: "The Holy
   Spirit, who created all things, dwelt in a body in which He wished to
   dwell." [See Grabe's collation and emendation here, in Wake's
   translation.]

   [281] The Vatican renders this sentence: "This body, therefore, into
   which the Holy Spirit was led, was subject to that Spirit, walking
   rightly, modestly, and chastely, and did not at all defile that Spirit.
   Since, then, that body had always obeyed the Holy Spirit, and had
   laboured rightly and chastely with it, and had not at any time given
   way, that wearied body passed its time as a slave; but having strongly
   approved itself along with the Holy Spirit, it was received unto God."
   The Palatine is similar. The Æth. reads: "That body served well in
   righteousness and purity, nor did it ever defile that Spirit, and it
   became His partner, since that body pleased God."

   the text. Grabe says emphatically, that "the created Spirit of Christ
   as a man and not the Holy Ghost, the third person of the Trinity," is
   spoken of in this chapter chiefly. The apparent confusion of words and
   phrases must be the result of ignorant copying. It is a sufficient
   answer to certain German critics to cite the providential approval of
   Athanasius, a fact of the utmost moment. Nobody doubts that Athanasius
   was sensitive to any discoloration of the Nicene Faith. In the text of
   Hermas, therefore, as it was in his copy, there could have been nothing
   heretical, or favouring heresy. That Hermas was an artist, and
   purposely gave his fiction a very primitive air, is evident. He fears
   to name the Scriptures he quoted, lest any one should doubt their use,
   in the days of Clement, in the Western churches.]

    Similitude Sixth.

      Of the Two Classes of Voluptuous Men, and of Their Death, Falling Away,
      and the Duration of Their Punishment.

      Chap. I.

   Sitting in my house, and glorifying the Lord for all that I had seen,
   and reflecting on the commandments, that they are excellent, and
   powerful, and glorious, and able to save a man's soul, I said within
   myself, "I shall be blessed if I walk in these commandments, and every
   one who walks in them will be blessed." While I was saying these words
   to myself, I suddenly see him sitting beside me, and hear him thus
   speak: "Why are you in doubt about the commandments which I gave you?
   They are excellent: have no doubt about them at all, but put on faith
   in the Lord, and you will walk in them, for I will strengthen you in
   them. These commandments are beneficial to those who intend to repent:
   for if they do not walk in them, their repentance is in vain. You,
   therefore, who repent cast away the wickedness of this world which
   wears you out; and by putting on all the virtues of a holy life, you
   will be able to keep these commandments, and will no longer add to the
   number of your sins. Walk, [289] therefore, in these commandments of
   mine, and you will live unto God. All these things have been spoken to
   you by me." And after he had uttered these words, he said to me, "Let
   us go into the fields, and I will show you the shepherds of the
   flocks." "Let us go, sir," I replied. And we came to a certain plain,
   and he showed me a young man, a shepherd, clothed in a suit of garments
   of a yellow colour: and he was herding very many sheep, and these sheep
   were feeding luxuriously, as it were, and riotously, and merrily
   skipping hither and thither. The shepherd himself was merry, because of
   his flock; and the appearance of the shepherd was joyous, and he was
   running about amongst his flock. [And other sheep I saw rioting and
   luxuriating in one place, but not, however, leaping about. [290] ]

      Chap. II.

   And he said to me, "Do you see this shepherd?" "I see him, sir," I
   said. "This," he answered, "is the angel [291] of luxury and deceit: he
   wears out the souls of the servants of God, and perverts them from the
   truth, deceiving them with wicked desires, through which they will
   perish; for they forget the commandments of the living God, and walk in
   deceits and empty luxuries; and they are ruined by the angel, some
   being brought to death, others to corruption." [292] I said to him,
   "Sir, I do not know the meaning of these words, to death, and to
   corruption.'" "Listen," he said. "The sheep which you saw merry and
   leaping about, are those which have torn themselves away from God for
   ever, and have delivered themselves over to luxuries and deceits [293]
   [of this world. Among them there is no return to life through
   repentance, because they have added to their other sins, and blasphemed
   the name of the Lord. Such men therefore, are appointed unto death.
   [294] And the sheep which you saw not leaping, but feeding in one
   place, are they who have delivered themselves over to luxury and
   deceit], but have committed no blasphemy against the Lord. These have
   been perverted from the truth: among them there is the hope of
   repentance, by which it is possible to live. Corruption, then, has a
   hope of a kind of renewal, [295] but death has everlasting ruin." Again
   I went forward a little way, and he showed me a tall shepherd, somewhat
   savage in his appearance, clothed in a white goatskin, and having a
   wallet on his shoulders, and a very hard staff with branches, and a
   large whip. And he had a very sour look, so that I was afraid of him,
   so forbidding was his aspect. This shepherd, accordingly, was receiving
   the sheep from the young shepherd, those, viz., that were rioting and
   luxuriating, but not leaping; and he cast them into a precipitous
   place, full of thistles and thorns, so that it was impossible to
   extricate the sheep from the thorns and thistles; but they were
   completely entangled amongst them. These, accordingly, thus entangled,
   pastured amongst the thorns and thistles, and were exceedingly
   miserable, being beaten by him; and he drove them hither and thither,
   and gave them no rest; and, altogether, these sheep were in a wretched
   plight.

      Chap. III.

   Seeing them, therefore, so beaten and so badly used, I was grieved for
   them, because they were so tormented, and had no rest at all. And I
   said to the Shepherd who talked with me, "Sir, who is this shepherd,
   who is so pitiless and severe, and so completely devoid of compassion
   for these sheep?" "This," he replied, "is the angel of punishment;
   [296] and he belongs to the just angels, and is appointed to punish. He
   accordingly takes those who wander away from God, and who have walked
   in the desires and deceits of this world, and chastises them as they
   deserve with terrible and diverse punishments." "I would know, sir," I
   said, "Of what nature are these diverse tortures and punishments?"
   "Hear," he said, "the various tortures and punishments. The tortures
   are such as occur during life. [297] For some are punished with losses,
   others with want, others with sicknesses of various kinds, and others
   with all kinds of disorder and confusion; others are insulted by
   unworthy persons, and exposed to suffering in many other ways: for
   many, becoming unstable in their plans, try many things, and none of
   them at all succeed, and they say they are not prosperous in their
   undertakings; and it does not occur to their minds that they have done
   evil deeds, but they blame the Lord. [298] When, therefore, they have
   been afflicted with all kinds of affliction, then are they delivered
   unto me for good training, and they are made strong in the faith of the
   Lord; and [299] for the rest of the days of their life they are subject
   to the Lord with pure hearts, and are successful in all their
   undertakings, obtaining from the Lord everything they ask; and then
   they glorify the Lord, that they were delivered to me, and no longer
   suffer any evil."

      Chap. IV.

   I said to him, "Sir, explain this also to me." "What is it you ask?" he
   said. "Whether, sir," I continued, "they who indulge in luxury, and who
   are deceived, are tortured for the same period of time that they have
   indulged in luxury and deceit?" He said to me, "They are tortured in
   the same manner." [300] ["They are tormented much less, sir," I
   replied; [301] ] "for those who are so luxurious and who forget God
   ought to be tortured seven-fold." He said to me "You are foolish, and
   do not understand the power of torment." "Why, sir," I said, "if I had
   understood it, I would not have asked you to show me." "Hear," he said,
   "the power of both. The time of luxury and deceit is one hour; but the
   hour of torment is equivalent to thirty days. If, accordingly, a man
   indulge in luxury for one day, and be deceived and be tortured for one
   day, the day of his torture is equivalent to a whole year. For all the
   days of luxury, therefore, there are as many years of torture to be
   undergone. You see, then," he continued, "that the time of luxury and
   deceit is very short, [302] but that of punishment and torture long."

      Chap. V.

   "Still," I said, "I do not quite understand about the time of deceit,
   and luxury, and torture; explain it to me more clearly." He answered,
   and said to me, "Your folly is persistent; and you do not wish to
   purify your heart, and serve God. Have a care," he added, "lest the
   time be fulfilled, and you be found foolish. Hear now," he added, "as
   you desire, that you may understand these things. He who indulges in
   luxury, and is deceived for one day, and who does what he wishes, is
   clothed with much foolishness, and does not understand the act which he
   does until the morrow; for he forgets what he did the day before. For
   luxury and deceit have no memories, on account of the folly with which
   they are clothed; but when punishment and torture cleave to a man for
   one day, he is punished and tortured for a year; for punishment and
   torture have powerful memories. While tortured and punished, therefore,
   for a whole year, he remembers at last [303] his luxury and deceit, and
   knows that on their account he suffers evil. Every man, therefore, who
   is luxurious and deceived is thus tormented, because, although having
   life, they have given themselves over to death." "What kinds of luxury,
   sir," I asked, "are hurtful?" "Every act of a man which he performs
   with pleasure," he replied, "is an act of luxury; for the
   sharp-tempered man, when gratifying his tendency, indulges in luxury;
   and the adulterer, and the drunkard, and the back-biter, and the liar,
   and the covetous man, and the thief, and he who does things like these,
   gratifies his peculiar propensity, and in so doing indulges in luxury.
   All these acts of luxury are hurtful to the servants of God. On account
   of these deceits, therefore, do they suffer, who are punished and
   tortured. And there are also acts of luxury which save men; for many
   who do good indulge in luxury, being carried away by their own
   pleasure: [304] this luxury, however, is beneficial to the servants of
   God, and gains life for such a man; but the injurious acts of luxury
   before enumerated bring tortures and punishment upon them; and if they
   continue in them and do not repent, they bring death upon themselves."

   were punished (epaideuthesan) according to their deeds."

   [299] The Vatican inserts the following sentence before this: "And when
   they begin to repent of their sins, then the works in which they have
   wickedly exercised themselves arise in their hearts; and then they give

      They Who Repent Must Bring Forth Fruits Worthy of Repentance.

   After a few days I saw him in the same plain where I had also seen the
   shepherds; and he said to me, "What do you wish with me?" I said to
   him, "Sir, that you would order the shepherd who punishes to depart out
   of my house, because he afflicts me exceedingly." "It is necessary," he
   replied, "that you be afflicted; for thus," he continued, "did the
   glorious angel command concerning you, as he wishes you to be tried."
   "What have I done which is so bad, sir," I replied, "that I should be
   delivered over to this angel?" "Listen," he said: "Your sins are many,
   but not so great as to require that you be delivered over to this
   angel; but your household has committed great iniquities and sins, and
   the glorious angel has been incensed at them on account of their deeds;
   and for this reason he commanded you to be afflicted for a certain
   time, that they also might repent, and purify themselves from every
   desire of this world. When, therefore, they repent and are purified,
   then the angel of punishment will depart." I said to him, "Sir, if they
   have done such things as to incense the glorious angel against them,
   yet what have I done?" He replied, "They cannot be afflicted at all,
   unless you, the head of the house, be afflicted: for when you are
   afflicted, of necessity they also suffer affliction; but if you are in
   comfort, they can feel no affliction." "Well, sir," I said, "they have
   repented with their whole heart." "I know, too," he answered, "that
   they have repented with their whole heart: do you think, however, that
   the sins of those who repent are remitted? [305] Not altogether, but he
   who repents must torture his own soul, and be exceedingly humble in all
   his conduct, and be afflicted with many kinds of affliction; and if he
   endure the afflictions that come upon him, He who created all things,
   and endued them with power, will assuredly have compassion, and will
   heal him; and this will He do when He sees the heart of every penitent
   pure from every evil thing: [306] and it is profitable for you and for
   your house to suffer affliction now. But why should I say much to you?
   You must be afflicted, as that angel of the Lord commanded who
   delivered you to me. And for this give thanks to the Lord, because He
   has deemed you worthy of showing you beforehand this affliction, that,
   knowing it before it comes, you may be able to bear it with courage."
   [307] I said to him, "Sir, be thou with me, and I will be able to bear
   all affliction." "I will be with you," he said, "and I will ask the
   angel of punishment to afflict you more lightly; nevertheless, you will
   be afflicted for a little time, and again you will be re-established in
   your house. Only continue humble, and serve the Lord in all purity of
   heart, you and your children, and your house, and walk in my commands
   which I enjoin upon you, and your repentance will be deep and pure; and
   if you observe these things with your household, every affliction will
   depart from you. [308] And affliction," he added, "will depart from all
   who walk in these my commandments."

   Latin translations. [Mal. iii. 3; Isa. i. 22; Ps. xxvi. 2, cxxxix. 23,

   [307] The Vatican has: "But rather give thanks to the Lord, that He,
   knowing what is to come to pass, has deemed you worthy to tell you
   beforehand that affiction is coming upon those who are able to bear
   it." [1 Cor. x. 13. But the whole argument turns on Jas. i. 2, as

      The Sins of the Elect and of the Penitent are of Many Kinds, But All Will
      Be Rewarded According to the Measure of Their Repentance and Good Works.

      Chap. I.

   He showed me a large willow tree overshadowing plains and mountains,
   and under the shade of this willow had assembled all those who were
   called by the name of the Lord. And a glorious angel of the Lord, who
   was very tall, was standing beside the willow, having a large
   pruning-knife, and he was cutting little twigs from the willow and
   distributing them among the people that were overshadowed by the
   willow; and the twigs which he gave them were small, about a cubit, as
   it were, in length. And after they had all received the twigs, the
   angel laid down the pruning-knife, and that tree was sound, as I had
   seen it at first. And I marvelled within myself, saying, "How is the
   tree sound, after so many branches have been cut off?" And the Shepherd
   said to me, "Do not be surprised if the tree remains sound after so
   many branches were lopped off; [but wait, [309] ] and when you shall
   have seen everything, then it will be explained to you what it means."
   The angel who had distributed the branches among the people again asked
   them from them, and in the order in which they had received them were
   they summoned to him, and each one of them returned his branch. And the
   angel of the Lord took and looked at them. From some he received the
   branches withered and moth-eaten; those who returned branches in that
   state the angel of the Lord ordered to stand apart. Others, again,
   returned them withered, but not moth-eaten; and these he ordered to
   stand apart. And others returned them half-withered, and these stood
   apart; and others returned their branches half-withered and having
   cracks in them, and these stood apart. [And others returned their
   branches green and having cracks in them; and these stood apart. [310]
   ] And others returned their branches, one-half withered and the other
   green; and these stood apart. And others brought their branches
   two-thirds green and the remaining third withered; and these stood
   apart. And others returned them two-thirds withered and one-third
   green; and these stood apart. And others returned their branches nearly
   all green, the smallest part only, the top, being withered, but they
   had cracks in them; and these stood apart. And of others very little
   was green, but the remaining parts withered; and these stood apart. And
   others came bringing their branches green, as they had received them
   from the angel. And the majority of the crowd returned branches of that
   kind, and with these the angel was exceedingly pleased; and these stood
   apart. [And others returned their branches green and having offshoots;
   and these stood apart, and with these the angel was exceedingly
   delighted. [311] ] And others returned their branches green and with
   offshoots, and the offshoots had some fruit, as it were; [312] and
   those men whose branches were found to be of that kind were exceedingly
   joyful. And the angel was exultant because of them; and the Shepherd
   also rejoiced greatly because of them.

      Chap. II.

   And the angel of the Lord ordered crowns to be brought; [313] and there
   were brought crowns, formed, as it were, of palms; and he crowned the
   men who had returned the branches which had offshoots and some fruit,
   and sent them away into the tower. And the others also he sent into the
   tower, those, namely, who had returned branches that were green and had
   offshoots but no fruit, having given them seals. [314] And all who went
   into the tower had the same clothing--white as snow. [315] And those
   who returned their branches green, as they had received them, he set
   free, giving them clothing and seals. Now after the angel had finished
   these things, he said to the Shepherd, "I am going away, and you will
   send these away within the walls, according as each one is worthy to
   have his dwelling. And examine their branches carefully, and so dismiss
   them; but examine them with care. See that no one escape you," he
   added; "and if any escape you, I will try them at the altar." [316]
   Having said these words to the Shepherd, he departed. And after the
   angel had departed, the Shepherd said to me, "Let us take the branches
   of all these and plant them, and see if any of them will live." I said
   to him, "Sir, how can these withered branches live?" He answered, and
   said, "This tree is a willow, and of a kind that is very tenacious of
   life. If, therefore, the branches be planted, and receive a little
   moisture, many of them will live. And now let us try, and pour water
   [317] upon them; and if any of them live I shall rejoice with them, and
   if they do not I at least will not be found neglectful." And the
   Shepherd bade me call them as each one was placed. And they came, rank
   by rank, and gave their branches to the Shepherd. And the Shepherd
   received the branches, and planted them in rows; and after he had
   planted them he poured much water upon them, so that the branches could
   not be seen for the water; and after the branches had drunk it in, he
   said to me, "Let us go, and return after a few days, and inspect all
   the branches; for He who created this tree wishes all those to live who
   received branches [318] from it. And I also hope that the greater part
   of these branches which received moisture and drank of the water will
   live."

      Chap. III.

   I said to him, "Sir, explain to me what this tree means, for I am
   perplexed about it, because, after so many branches have been cut off,
   it continues sound, and nothing appears to have been cut away from it.
   By this, now, I am perplexed." "Listen," he said: "This great tree
   [319] that casts its shadow over plains, and mountains, and all the
   earth, is the law of God that was given to the whole world; and this
   law is the Son of God, [320] proclaimed to the ends of the earth; and
   the people who are under its shadow are they who have heard the
   proclamation, and have believed upon Him. And the great and glorious
   angel Michael is he who has authority over this people, and governs
   them; [321] for this is he who gave them the law [322] into the hearts
   of believers: he accordingly superintends them to whom he gave it, to
   see if they have kept the same. And you see the branches of each one,
   for the branches are the law. You see, accordingly, many branches that
   have been rendered useless, and you will know them all--those who have
   not kept the law; and you will see the dwelling of each one." I said to
   him, "Sir, why did he dismiss some into the tower, and leave others to
   you?" "All," he answered, "who transgressed the law which they received
   from him, he left under my power for repentance; but all who have
   satisfied the law, and kept it, he retains under his own authority."
   "Who, then," I continued, "are they who were crowned, and who go to the
   tower?" "These are they who have suffered on account of the law; but
   the others, and they who returned their branches green, and with
   offshoots, but without fruit, are they who have been afflicted on
   account of the law, but who have not suffered nor denied [323] their
   law; and they who returned their branches green as they had received
   them, are the venerable, and the just, and they who have walked
   carefully in a pure heart, and have kept the commandments of the Lord.
   And the rest you will know when I have examined those branches which
   have been planted and watered."

      Chap. IV.

   And after a few days we came to the place, and the Shepherd sat down in
   the angel's place, and I stood beside him. And he said to me, "Gird
   yourself with pure, undressed linen made of sackcloth;" and seeing me
   girded, and ready to minister to him, "Summon," he said, "the men to
   whom belong the branches that were planted, according to the order in
   which each one gave them in." So I went away to the plain, and summoned
   them all, and they all stood in their ranks. He said to them, "Let each
   one pull out his own branch, and bring it to me." The first to give in
   were those who had them withered and cut; and [324] because they were
   found to be thus withered and cut, he commanded them to stand apart.
   And next they gave them in who had them withered, but not cut. And some
   of them gave in their branches green, and some withered and eaten as by
   a moth. Those that gave them in green, accordingly, he ordered to stand
   apart; and those who gave them in dry and cut, he ordered to stand
   along with the first. Next they gave them in who had them half-withered
   and cracked; [325] and many of them gave them in green and without
   cracks; and some green and with offshoots and fruits upon the
   offshoots, such as they had who went, after being crowned, into the
   tower. And some handed them in withered and eaten, and some withered
   and uneaten; and some as they were, half-withered and cracked. And he
   commanded them each one to stand apart, some towards their own rows,
   and others apart from them.

      Chap. V.

   Then they gave in their branches who had them green, but cracked: all
   these gave them in green, and stood in their own row. And the Shepherd
   was pleased with these, because they were all changed, and had lost
   their cracks. [326] And they also gave them in who had them half-green
   and half-withered: of some, accordingly, the branches were found
   completely green; of others, half-withered; of others, withered and
   eaten; of others, green, and having offshoots. All these were sent
   away, each to his own row. [Next they gave in who had them two parts
   green and one-third withered. Many of them gave them half-withered; and
   others withered and rotten; and others half-withered and cracked, and a
   few green. These all stood in their own row. [327] ] And they gave them
   in who had them green, but to a very slight extent withered and
   cracked. [328] Of these, some gave them in green, and others green and
   with offshoots. And these also went away to their own row. Next they
   gave them who had a very small part green and the other parts withered.
   Of these the branches were found for the most part green and having
   offshoots, and fruit upon the offshoots, and others altogether green.
   With these branches the Shepherd was exceedingly pleased, because they
   were found in this state. And these went away, each to his own row.

      Chap. VI.

   After the Shepherd had examined the branches of them all, he said to
   me, "I told you that this tree was tenacious of life. You see," he
   continued, "how many repented and were saved." "I see, sir," I replied.
   "That you may behold," he added, "the great mercy of the Lord, that it
   is great and glorious, and that He has given His Spirit to those who
   are worthy of repentance." "Why then, sir," I said, "did not all these
   repent?" He answered, "To them whose heart He saw would become pure,
   and obedient to Him, He gave power to repent with the whole heart. But
   to them whose deceit and wickedness He perceived, and saw that they
   intended to repent hypocritically, He did not grant repentance, [329]
   lest they should again profane His name." I said to him, "Sir, show me
   now, with respect to those who gave in the branches, of what sort they
   are, and their abode, in order that they hearing it who believed, and
   received the seal, and broke it, and did not keep it whole, may, on
   coming to a knowledge of their deeds, repent, and receive from you a
   seal, and may glorify the Lord because He had compassion upon them, and
   sent you to renew their spirits." "Listen," he said: "they whose
   branches were found withered and moth-eaten are the apostates and
   traitors of the Church, who have blasphemed the Lord in their sins, and
   have, moreover, been ashamed of the name of the Lord by which they were
   called. [330] These, therefore, at the end were lost unto God. And you
   see that not a single one of them repented, although they heard the
   words which I spake to them, which I enjoined upon you. From such life
   departed. [331] And they who gave them in withered and undecayed, these
   also were near to them; for they were hypocrites, and introducers of
   strange doctrines, and subverters of the servants of God, especially of
   those who had sinned, not allowing them to repent, but persuading them
   by foolish doctrines. [332] These, accordingly, have a hope of
   repentance. And you see that many of them also have repented since I
   spake to them, and they will still repent. But all who will not repent
   have lost their lives; and as many of them as repented became good, and
   their dwelling was appointed within the first walls; and some of them
   ascended even into the tower. You see, then," he said, "that repentance
   involves life to sinners, but non-repentance death."

      Chap. VII.

   "And as many as gave in the branches half-withered and cracked, hear
   also about them. They whose branches were half-withered to the same
   extent are the wavering; for they neither live, nor are they dead. And
   they who have them half-withered and cracked are both waverers and
   slanderers, [railing against the absent,] and never at peace with one
   another, but always at variance. And yet to these also," he continued,
   "repentance is possible. You see," he said, "that some of them have
   repented, and there is still remaining in them," he continued, "a hope
   of repentance. And as many of them," he added, "as have repented, shall
   have their dwelling in the tower. And those of them who have been
   slower in repenting shall dwell within the walls. And as many as do not
   repent at all, but abide in their deeds, shall utterly perish. And they
   who gave in their branches green and cracked were always faithful and
   good, though emulous of each other about the foremost places, and about
   fame: [333] now all these are foolish, in indulging in such a rivalry.
   Yet they also, being naturally good, [334] on hearing my commandments,
   purified themselves, and soon repented. Their dwelling, accordingly,
   was in the tower. But if any one relapse into strife, he will be cast
   out of the tower, and will lose his life. [335] Life is the possession
   of all who keep the commandments of the Lord; but in the commandments
   there is no rivalry in regard to the first places, or glory of any
   kind, but in regard to patience and personal humility. Among such
   persons, then, is the life of the Lord, but amongst the quarrelsome and
   transgressors, death."

      Chap. VIII.

   "And they who gave in their branches half-green and half-withered, are
   those who are immersed in business, and do not cleave to the saints.
   For this reason, the one half of them is living, and the other half
   dead. [336] Many, accordingly, who heard my commands repented, and
   those at least who repented had their dwelling in the tower. But some
   of them at last fell away: these, accordingly, have not repentance, for
   on account of their business they blasphemed the Lord, and denied Him.
   They therefore lost their lives through the wickedness which they
   committed. And many of them doubted. These still have repentance in
   their power, if they repent speedily; and their abode will be in the
   tower. But if they are slower in repenting, they will dwell within the
   walls; and if they do not repent, they too have lost their lives. And
   they who gave in their branches two-thirds withered and one-third
   green, are those who have denied [the Lord] in various ways. Many,
   however, repented, but some of them hesitated and were in doubt. These,
   then, have repentance within their reach, if they repent quickly, and
   do not remain in their pleasures; [337] but if they abide in their
   deeds, these, too, work to themselves death."

      Chap. IX.

   "And they who returned their branches two-thirds withered and one-third
   green, are those that were faithful indeed; but after acquiring wealth,
   and becoming distinguished amongst the heathen, they clothed themselves
   with great pride, and became lofty-minded, and deserted the truth, and
   did not cleave to the righteous, but lived with the heathen, and this
   way of life became more agreeable to them. [338] They did not, however,
   depart from God, but remained in the faith, although not working the
   works of faith. Many of them accordingly repented, and their dwelling
   was in the tower. And others continuing to live until the end with the
   heathen, and being corrupted by their vain glories, [departed from God,
   serving the works and deeds of the heathen. [339] ] These were reckoned
   with the heathen. But others of them hesitated, not hoping to be saved
   on account of the deeds which they had done; while others were in
   doubt, and caused divisions among themselves. To those, therefore, who
   were in doubt on account of their deeds, repentance is still open; but
   their repentance ought to be speedy, that their dwelling may be in the
   tower. And to those who do not repent, but abide in their pleasures,
   death is near."

      Chap. X.

   "And they who give in their branches green, but having the tips
   withered and cracked, these were always good, and faithful, and
   distinguished before God; but they sinned a very little through
   indulging small desires, and finding little faults with one another.
   But on hearing my words the greater part of them quickly repented, and
   their dwelling was upon the tower. Yet some of them were in doubt; and
   certain of them who were in doubt wrought greater dissension. Among
   these, therefore, is hope of repentance, because they were always good;
   and with difficulty will any one of them perish. And they who gave up
   their branches withered, [340] but having a very small part green, are
   those who believed only, yet continue working the works of iniquity.
   They never, however, departed from God, but gladly bore His name, and
   joyfully received His servants into their houses. [341] Having
   accordingly heard of this repentance, they unhesitatingly repented, and
   practice all virtue and righteousness; and some of them even [suffered,
   being willingly put to death [342] ], knowing their deeds which they
   had done. Of all these, therefore, the dwelling shall be in the tower."

      Chap. XI.

   And after he had finished the explanations of all the branches, he said
   to me, "Go and tell them to every one, that they may repent, and they
   shall live unto God. [343] Because the Lord, having had compassion on
   all men, has sent me to give repentance, although some are not worthy
   of it on account of their works; but the Lord, being long-suffering,
   desires those who were called by His Son to be saved." [344] I said to
   him, "Sir, I hope that all who have heard them will repent; for I am
   persuaded that each one, on coming to a knowledge of his own works, and
   fearing the Lord, will repent." He answered me, and said, "All who with
   their whole heart shall purify themselves from their wickedness before
   enumerated, and shall add no more to their sins, will receive healing
   from the Lord for their former transgressions, if they do not hesitate
   at these commandments; and they will live unto God. But do you walk in
   my commandments, and live." Having shown me these things, and spoken
   all these words, he said to me, "And the rest I will show you after a
   few days."

      The Great Mysteries in the Building of the Militant and Triumphant Church.

      Chap. I.

   After I had written down the commandments and similitudes of the
   Shepherd, the angel of repentance, he came to me and said, "I wish to
   explain to you what the Holy Spirit [345] that spake with you in the
   form of the Church showed you, for that Spirit is the Son of God. For,
   as you were somewhat weak in the flesh, it was not explained to you by
   the angel. When, however, you were strengthened by the Spirit, and your
   strength was increased, so that you were able to see the angel also,
   then accordingly was the building of the tower shown you by the Church.
   In a noble and solemn manner did you see everything as if shown you by
   a virgin; but now you see [them] through the same Spirit as if shown by
   an angel. You must, however, learn everything from me with greater
   accuracy. For I was sent for this purpose by the glorious angel to
   dwell in your house, that you might see all things with power,
   entertaining no fear, even as it was before." And he led me away into
   Arcadia, to a round hill; [346] and he placed me on the top of the
   hill, and showed me a large plain, and round about the plain twelve
   mountains, all having different forms. The first was black as soot; and
   the second bare, without grass; and the third full of thorns and
   thistles; and the fourth with grass half-withered, the upper parts of
   the plants green, and the parts about the roots withered; and some of
   the grasses, when the sun scorched them, became withered. And the fifth
   mountain had green grass, and was ragged. And the sixth mountain was
   quite full of clefts, some small and others large; and the clefts were
   grassy, but the plants were not very vigorous, but rather, as it were,
   decayed. The seventh mountain, again, had cheerful pastures, and the
   whole mountain was blooming, and every kind of cattle and birds were
   feeding upon that mountain; and the more the cattle and the birds ate,
   the more the grass of that mountain flourished. And the eighth mountain
   was full of fountains, and every kind of the Lord's creatures drank of
   the fountains of that mountain. But the ninth mountain [had no water at
   all, and was wholly a desert, and had within it deadly serpents, which
   destroy men. And the tenth mountain [347] ] had very large trees, and
   was completely shaded, and under the shadow of the trees sheep lay
   resting and ruminating. And the eleventh mountain was very thickly
   wooded, and those trees were productive, being adorned with various
   sorts of fruits, so that any one seeing them would desire to eat of
   their fruits. The twelfth mountain, again, was wholly white, and its
   aspect was cheerful, and the mountain in itself was very beautiful.

      Chap. II.

   And in the middle of the plain he showed me a large white rock that had
   arisen out of the plain. And the rock was more lofty than the
   mountains, rectangular in shape, so as to be capable of containing the
   whole world: and that rock was old, having a gate cut out of it; and
   the cutting out of the gate seemed to me as if recently done. And the
   gate glittered to such a degree under the sunbeams, that I marvelled at
   the splendour of the gate; [348] and round about the gate were standing
   twelve virgins. The four who stood at the corners seemed to me more
   distinguished than the others--they were all, however,
   distinguished--and they were standing at the four parts of the gate;
   two virgins between each part. And they were clothed with linen tunics,
   and gracefully girded, having their right shoulders exposed, as if
   about to bear some burden. Thus they stood ready; for they were
   exceedingly cheerful and eager. After I had seen these things, I
   marvelled in myself, because I was beholding great and glorious sights.
   And again I was perplexed about the virgins, because, although so
   delicate, they were standing courageously, as if about to carry the
   whole heavens. And the Shepherd said to me "Why are you reasoning in
   yourself, and perplexing your mind, and distressing yourself? for the
   things which you cannot understand, do not attempt to comprehend, as if
   you were wise; but ask the Lord, that you may receive understanding and
   know them. You cannot see what is behind you, but you see what is
   before. Whatever, then, you cannot see, let alone, and do not torment
   yourself about it: but what you see, make yourself master of it, and do
   not waste your labour about other things; and I will explain to you
   everything that I show you. Look therefore, on the things that remain."

      Chap. III.

   I saw six men come, tall, and distinguished, and similar in appearance,
   and they summoned a multitude of men. And they who came were also tall
   men, and handsome, and powerful; and the six men commanded them to
   build a tower [349] above the rock. And great was the noise of those
   men who came to build the tower, as they ran hither and thither around
   the gate. And the virgins who stood around the gate told the men to
   hasten to build the tower. Now the virgins had spread out their hands,
   as if about to receive something from the men. And the six men
   commanded stones to ascend out of a certain pit, and to go to the
   building of the tower. And there went up ten shining rectangular
   stones, not hewn in a quarry. And the six men called the virgins, and
   bade them carry all the stones that were intended for the building, and
   to pass through the gate, and give them to the men who were about to
   build the tower. And the virgins put upon one another the ten first
   stones which had ascended from the pit, and carried them together, each
   stone by itself.

      Chap. IV.

   And as they stood together around the gate, those who seemed to be
   strong carried them, and they stooped down under the corners of the
   stone; and the others stooped down under the sides of the stones. And
   in this way they carried all the stones. [350] And they carried them
   through the gate as they were commanded, and gave them to the men for
   the tower; and they took the stones and proceeded with the building.
   Now the tower was built upon the great rock, and above the gate. Those
   ten stones were prepared as the foundation for the building of the
   tower. And the rock and gate were the support of the whole of the
   tower. And after the ten stones other twenty [five] came up out of the
   pit, and these were fitted into the building of the tower, being
   carried by the virgins as before. And after these ascended thirty-five.
   And these in like manner were fitted into the tower. And after these
   other forty stones came up; and all these were cast into the building
   of the tower, [and there were four rows in the foundation of the tower,
   [351] ] and they ceased ascending from the pit. And the builders also
   ceased for a little. And again the six men commanded the multitude of
   the crowd to bear stones from the mountains for the building of the
   tower. They were accordingly brought from all the mountains of various
   colours, and being hewn by the men were given to the virgins; and the
   virgins carried them through the gate, and gave them for the building
   of the tower. And when the stones of various colours were placed in the
   building, they all became white alike, and lost their different
   colours. And certain stones were given by the men for the building, and
   these did not become shining; but as they were placed, such also were
   they found to remain: for they were not given by the virgins, nor
   carried through the gate. These stones, therefore, were not in keeping
   with the others in the building of the tower. And the six men, seeing
   these unsuitable stones in the building, commanded them to be taken
   away, and to be carried away down to their own place whence they had
   been taken; [and being removed one by one, they were laid aside; and]
   they say to the men who brought the stones, "Do not ye bring any stones
   at all for the building, but lay them down beside the tower, that the
   virgins may carry them through the gate, and may give them for the
   building. For unless," they said, "they be carried through the gate by
   the hands of the virgins, they cannot change their colours: do not
   toil, therefore," they said, "to no purpose."

      Chap. V.

   And on that day the building was finished, but the tower was not
   completed; for additional building was again about to be added, and
   there was a cessation in the building. And the six men commanded the
   builders all to withdraw a little distance, and to rest, but enjoined
   the virgins not to withdraw from the tower; and it seemed to me that
   the virgins had been left to guard the tower. Now after all had
   withdrawn, and were resting themselves, I said to the Shepherd, "What
   is the reason that the building of the tower was not finished?" "The
   tower," he answered, "cannot be finished just yet, until the Lord of it
   come and examine the building, in order that, if any of the stones be
   found to be decayed, he may change them: for the tower is built
   according to his pleasure." "I would like to know, sir," I said, "what
   is the meaning of the building of this tower, and what the rock and
   gate, and the mountains, and the virgins mean, and the stones that
   ascended from the pit, and were not hewn, but came as they were to the
   building. Why, in the first place, were ten stones placed in the
   foundation, then twenty-five, then thirty-five, then forty? and I wish
   also to know about the stones that went to the building, and were again
   taken out and returned to their own place? On all these points put my
   mind at rest, sir, and explain them to me." "If you are not found to be
   curious about trifles," he replied, "you shall know everything. For
   after a few days [we shall come hither, and you will see the other
   things that happen to this tower, and will know accurately all the
   similitudes." After a few days [352] ] we came to the place where we
   sat down. And he said to me, "Let us go to the tower; for the master of
   the tower is coming to examine it." And we came to the tower, and there
   was no one at all near it, save the virgins only. And the Shepherd
   asked the virgins if perchance the master of the tower had come; and
   they replied that he was about to come [353] to examine the building.

      Chap. VI.

   And, behold, after a little I see an array of many men coming, and in
   the midst of them one man [354] of so remarkable a size as to overtop
   the tower. And the six men who had worked upon the building were with
   him, and many other honourable men were around him. And the virgins who
   kept the tower ran forward and kissed him, and began to walk near him
   around the tower. And that man examined the building carefully, feeling
   every stone separately; and holding a rod in his hand, he struck every
   stone in the building three times. And when he struck them, some of
   them became black as soot, and some appeared as if covered with scabs,
   and some cracked, and some mutilated, and some neither white nor black,
   and some rough and not in keeping with the other stones, and some
   having [very many] stains: such were the varieties of decayed stones
   that were found in the building. He ordered all these to be taken out
   of the tower, and to be laid down beside it, and other stones to be
   brought and put in their stead. [And the builders asked him from what
   mountain he wished them to be brought and put in their place. [355] ]
   And he did not command them to be brought from the mountains, [but he
   bade them be brought from a certain plain which was near at hand. [356]
   ] And the plain was dug up, and shining rectangular stones were found,
   and some also of a round shape; and all the stones which were in that
   plain were brought, and carried through the gate by the virgins. And
   the rectangular stones were hewn, and put in place of those that were
   taken away; but the rounded stones were not put into the building,
   because they were hard to hew, and appeared to yield slowly to the
   chisel; they were deposited, however, beside the tower, as if intended
   to be hewn and used in the building, for they were exceedingly
   brilliant.

      Chap. VII.

   The glorious man, the lord of the whole tower, having accordingly
   finished these alterations, called to him the Shepherd, and delivered
   to him all the stones that were lying beside the tower, that had been
   rejected from the building, and said to him, "Carefully clean all these
   stones, and put aside such for the building of the tower as may
   harmonize with the others; and those that do not, throw far away from
   the tower." [Having given these orders to the Shepherd, he departed
   from the tower [357] ], with all those with whom he had come. Now the
   virgins were standing around the tower, keeping it. I said again to the
   Shepherd, "Can these stones return to the building of the tower, after
   being rejected?" He answered me, and said, "Do you see these stones?"
   "I see them, sir," I replied. "The greater part of these stones," he
   said, "I will hew, and put into the building, and they will harmonize
   with the others." "How, sir," I said, "can they, after being cut all
   round about, fill up the same space?" He answered, "Those that shall be
   found small will be thrown into the middle of the building, and those
   that are larger will be placed on the outside, and they will hold them
   together." Having spoken these words, he said to me, "Let us go, and
   after two days let us come and clean these stones, and cast them into
   the building; for all things around the tower must be cleaned, lest the
   Master come suddenly [358] and find the places about the tower dirty,
   and be displeased, and these stones be not returned for the building of
   the tower, and I also shall seem to be neglectful towards the Master."
   And after two days we came to the tower, and he said to me, "Let us
   examine all the stones, and ascertain those which may return to the
   building." I said to him, "Sir, let us examine them!"

      Chap. VIII.

   And beginning, we first examined the black stones. And such as they had
   been taken out of the building, were they found to remain; and the
   Shepherd ordered them to be removed out of the tower, and to be placed
   apart. Next he examined those that had scabs; and he took and hewed
   many of these, and commanded the virgins to take them up and cast them
   into the building. And the virgins lifted them up, and put them in the
   middle of the building of the tower. And the rest he ordered to be laid
   down beside the black ones; for these, too, were found to be black. He
   next examined those that had cracks; and he hewed many of these, and
   commanded them to be carried by the virgins to the building: and they
   were placed on the outside, because they were found to be sounder than
   the others; but the rest, on account of the multitude of the cracks,
   could not be hewn, and for this reason, therefore, they were rejected
   from the building of the tower. He next examined the chipped stones,
   and many amongst these were found to be black, and some to have great
   cracks. And these also he commanded to be laid down along with those
   which had been rejected. But the remainder, after being cleaned and
   hewn, he commanded to be placed in the building. And the virgins took
   them up, and fitted them into the middle of the building of the tower,
   for they were somewhat weak. He next examined those that were half
   white and half black, and many of them were found to be black. And he
   commanded these also to be taken away along with those which had been
   rejected. And the rest were all taken away by the virgins; for, being
   white, they were fitted by the virgins themselves into the building.
   And they were placed upon the outside, because they were found to be
   sound, so as to be able to support those which were placed in the
   middle, for no part of them at all was chipped. He next examined those
   that were rough and hard; and a few of them were rejected because they
   could not be hewn, as they were found exceedingly hard. But the rest of
   them were hewn, and carried by the virgins, and fitted into the middle
   of the building of the tower; for they were somewhat weak. He next
   examined those that had stains; and of these a very few were black, and
   were thrown aside with the others; but the greater part were found to
   be bright, and these were fitted by the virgins into the building, but
   on account of their strength were placed on the outside.

      Chap. IX.

   He next came to examine the white and rounded stones, and said to me,
   "What are we to do with these stones?" "How do I know, sir?" I replied.
   "Have you no intentions regarding them?" "Sir," I answered, "I am not
   acquainted with this art, neither am I a stone-cutter, nor can I tell."
   "Do you not see," he said, "that they are exceedingly round? and if I
   wish to make them rectangular, a large portion of them must be cut
   away; for some of them must of necessity be put into the building." "If
   therefore," I said, "they must, why do you torment yourself, and not at
   once choose for the building those which you prefer, and fit them into
   it?" He selected the larger ones among them, and the shining ones, and
   hewed them; and the virgins carried and fitted them into the outside
   parts of the building. And the rest which remained over were carried
   away, and laid down on the plain from which they were brought. They
   were not, however, rejected, "because," he said, "there remains yet a
   little addition to be built to the tower. And the lord of this tower
   wishes all the stones to be fitted into the building, because they are
   exceedingly bright." And twelve women were called, very beautiful in
   form, clothed in black, and with dishevelled hair. And these women
   seemed to me to be fierce. But the Shepherd commanded them to lift the
   stones that were rejected from the building, and to carry them away to
   the mountains from which they had been brought. And they were merry,
   and carried away all the stones, and put them in the place whence they
   had been taken. Now after all the stones were removed, and there was no
   longer a single one lying around the tower, he said, "Let us go round
   the tower and see, lest there be any defect in it." So I went round the
   tower along with him. And the Shepherd, seeing that the tower was
   beautifully built, rejoiced exceedingly; for the tower was built in
   such a way, that, on seeing it, I coveted the building of it, for it
   was constructed as if built of one stone, without a single joining. And
   the stone seemed as if hewn out of the rock; having to me the
   appearance of a monolith.

      Chap. X.

   And as I walked along with him, I was full of joy, beholding so many
   excellent things. And the Shepherd said to me, "Go and bring unslaked
   lime and fine-baked clay, that I may fill up the forms of the stones
   that were taken and thrown into the building; for everything about the
   tower must be smooth." And I did as he commanded me, and brought it to
   him. "Assist me," he said, "and the work will soon be finished." He
   accordingly filled up the forms of the stones that were returned to the
   building, and commanded the places around the tower to be swept and to
   be cleaned; and the virgins took brooms and swept the place, and
   carried all the dirt out of the tower, and brought water, and the
   ground around the tower became cheerful and very beautiful. Says the
   Shepherd to me, "Everything has been cleared away; if the lord of the
   tower come to inspect it, he can have no fault to find with us." Having
   spoken these words, he wished to depart; but I laid hold of him by the
   wallet, and began to adjure him by the Lord that he would explain what
   he had showed me. He said to me, "I must rest a little, and then I
   shall explain to you everything; wait for me here until I return." I
   said to him, "Sir, what can I do here alone?" "You are not alone," he
   said, "for these virgins are with you." "Give me in charge to them,
   then," I replied. The Shepherd called them to him, and said to them, "I
   entrust him to you until I come," and went away. And I was alone with
   the virgins; and they were rather merry, but were friendly to me,
   especially the four more distinguished of them.

      Chap. XI.

   The virgins said to me, "The Shepherd does not come here to-day."
   "What, then," said I, "am I to do?" They replied, "Wait for him until
   he comes; and if he comes he will converse with you, and if he does not
   come you will remain here with us until he does come." I said to them,
   "I will wait for him until it is late; and if he does not arrive, I
   will go away into the house, and come back early in the morning." And
   they answered and said to me, "You were entrusted to us; you cannot go
   away from us." "Where, then," I said, "am I to remain?" "You will sleep
   with us," they replied, "as a brother, and not as a husband: for you
   are our brother, and for the time to come we intend to abide with you,
   for we love you exceedingly!" But I was ashamed to remain with them.
   And she who seemed to be the first among them began to kiss me. [And
   the others seeing her kissing me, began also to kiss me], and to lead
   me round the tower, and to play with me. [359] And I, too, became like
   a young man, and began to play with them: for some of them formed a
   chorus, and others danced, and others sang; and I, keeping silence,
   walked with them around the tower, and was merry with them. And when it
   grew late I wished to go into the house; and they would not let me, but
   detained me. So I remained with them during the night, and slept beside
   the tower. Now the virgins spread their linen tunics on the ground, and
   made me lie down in the midst of them; and they did nothing at all but
   pray; and I without ceasing prayed with them, and not less than they.
   And the virgins rejoiced because I thus prayed. And I remained there
   with the virgins until the next day at the second hour. Then the
   Shepherd returned, and said to the virgins, "Did you offer him any
   insult?" "Ask him," they said. I said to him, "Sir, I was delighted
   that I remained with them." "On what," he asked, "did you sup?" "I
   supped, sir," I replied, "on the words of the Lord the whole night."
   "Did they receive you well?" he inquired. "Yes, sir," I answered.
   "Now," he said, "what do you wish to hear first?" "I wish to hear in
   the order," I said, "in which you showed me from the beginning. I beg
   of you, sir, that as I shall ask you, so also you will give me the
   explanation." "As you wish," he replied, "so also will I explain to
   you, and will conceal nothing at all from you."

      Chap. XII.

   "First of all, sir," I said, "explain this to me: What is the meaning
   of the rock and the gate?" "This rock," he answered, "and this gate are
   the Son of God." "How, sir?" I said; "the rock is old, and the gate is
   new." "Listen," he said, "and understand, O ignorant man. The Son of
   God is older than all His creatures, so that He was a fellow-councillor
   with the Father in His work of creation: [360] for this reason is He
   old." "And why is the gate new, sir?" I said. "Because," he answered,
   "He became manifest [361] in the last days of the dispensation: for
   this reason the gate was made new, that they who are to be saved by it
   might enter into the kingdom of God. You saw," he said, "that those
   stones which came in through the gate were used for the building of the
   tower, and that those which did not come, were again thrown back to
   their own place?" "I saw, sir," I replied. "In like manner," he
   continued, "no one shall enter into the kingdom of God unless he
   receive His holy name. For if you desire to enter into a city, and that
   city is surrounded by a wall, and has but one gate, can you enter into
   that city save through the gate which it has?" "Why, how can it be
   otherwise, sir?" I said. "If, then, you cannot enter into the city
   except through its gate, so, in like manner, a man cannot otherwise
   enter into the kingdom of God than by the name of His beloved Son. You
   saw," he added, "the multitude who were building the tower?" "I saw
   them, sir," I said. "Those," he said, "are all glorious angels, and by
   them accordingly is the Lord surrounded. And the gate is the Son of
   God. This is the one entrance to the Lord. In no other way, then, shall
   any one enter in to Him except through His Son. You saw," he continued,
   "the six men, and the tall and glorious man in the midst of them, who
   walked round the tower, and rejected the stones from the building?" "I
   saw him, sir," I answered. "The glorious man," he said, "is the Son of
   God, and those six glorious angels are those who support Him on the
   right hand and on the left. None of these glorious angels," he
   continued, "will enter in unto God apart from Him. Whosoever does not
   receive His [362] name, shall not enter into the kingdom of God."

      Chap. XIII.

   "And the tower," I asked, "what does it mean?" "This tower," he
   replied, "is the Church." "And these virgins, who are they?" "They are
   holy spirits, and men cannot otherwise be found in the kingdom of God
   unless these have put their clothing upon them: for if you receive the
   name only, and do not receive from them the clothing, they are of no
   advantage to you. For these virgins are the powers of the Son of God.
   If you bear His name but possess not His power, it will be in vain that
   you bear His name. Those stones," he continued, "which you saw rejected
   bore His name, but did not put on the clothing of the virgins." "Of
   what nature is their clothing, sir?" I asked. "Their very names," he
   said, "are their clothing. Every one who bears the name of the Son of
   God, ought to bear the names also of these; for the Son Himself bears
   the names [363] of these virgins. As many stones," he continued, "as
   you saw [come into the building of the tower through the hands [364] ]
   of these virgins, and remaining, have been clothed with their strength.
   For this reason you see that the tower became of one stone with the
   rock. So also they who have believed on the Lord [365] through His Son,
   and are clothed with these spirits, shall become one spirit, one body,
   and the colour of their garments shall be one. And the dwelling of such
   as bear the names of the virgins is in the tower." "Those stones, sir,
   that were rejected," I inquired, "on what account were they rejected?
   for they passed through the gate, and were placed by the hands of the
   virgins in the building of the tower." "Since you take an interest in
   everything," he replied, "and examine minutely, hear about the stones
   that were rejected. These all," he said, "received the name of God, and
   they received also the strength of these virgins. Having received,
   then, these spirits, they were made strong, and were with the servants
   of God; and theirs was one spirit, and one body, and one clothing. For
   they were of the same mind, and wrought righteousness. After a certain
   time, however, they were persuaded by the women whom you saw clothed in
   black, and having their shoulders exposed and their hair dishevelled,
   and beautiful in appearance. Having seen these women, they desired to
   have them, and clothed themselves with their strength, and put off the
   strength of the virgins. These, accordingly, were rejected from the
   house of God, and were given over to these women. But they who were not
   deceived by the beauty of these women remained in the house of God. You
   have," he said, "the explanation of those who were rejected."

      Chap. XIV.

   "What, then, sir," I said, "if these men, being such as they are,
   repent and put away their desires after these women, and return again
   to the virgins, and walk in their strength and in their works, shall
   they not enter into the house of God?" "They shall enter in," he said,
   "if they put away the works of these women, and put on again the
   strength of the virgins, and walk in their works. For on this account
   was there a cessation in the building, in order that, if these repent,
   they may depart into the building of the tower. But if they do not
   repent, then others will come in their place, and these at the end will
   be cast out. For all these things I gave thanks to the Lord, because He
   had pity on all that call upon His name; and sent the angel of
   repentance to us who sinned against Him, and renewed our spirit; and
   when we were already destroyed, and had no hope of life, He restored us
   to newness of life." "Now, sir," I continued, "show me why the tower
   was not built upon the ground, but upon the rock and upon the gate."
   "Are you still," he said, "without sense and understanding?" "I must,
   sir," I said, "ask you of all things, because I am wholly unable to
   understand them; for all these things are great and glorious, and
   difficult for man to understand." "Listen," he said: "the name of the
   Son of God is great, and cannot be contained, and supports the whole
   world. [366] If, then, the whole creation is supported by the Son of
   God, what think ye of those who are called by Him, and bear the name of
   the Son of God, and walk in His commandments? do you see what kind of
   persons He supports? Those who bear His name with their whole heart. He
   Himself, accordingly, became a foundation [367] to them, and supports
   them with joy, because they are not ashamed to bear His name."

      Chap. XV. [368]

   "Explain to me, sir," I said, "the names of these virgins, and of those
   women who were clothed in black raiment." "Hear," he said, "the names
   of the stronger virgins who stood at the corners. The first is Faith,
   [369] the second Continence, the third Power, the fourth Patience. And
   the others standing in the midst of these have the following names:
   Simplicity, Innocence, Purity, Cheerfulness, Truth, Understanding,
   Harmony, Love. He who bears these names and that of the Son of God will
   be able to enter into the kingdom of God. Hear, also," he continued,
   "the names of the women who had the black garments; and of these four
   are stronger than the rest. The first is Unbelief, the second:
   Incontinence, the third Disobedience, the fourth Deceit. And their
   followers are called Sorrow, Wickedness, Wantonness, Anger, Falsehood,
   Folly, Backbiting, Hatred. The servant of God who bears these names
   shall see, indeed, the kingdom of God, but shall not enter into it."
   "And the stones, sir," I said, "which were taken out of the pit and
   fitted into the building: what are they?" "The first," he said, "the
   ten, viz., that were placed as a foundation, are the first generation,
   and the twenty-five the second generation, of righteous men; and the
   thirty-five are the prophets of God and His ministers; and the forty
   are the apostles and teachers of the preaching of the Son of God."
   [370] "Why, then, sir," I asked, "did the virgins carry these stones
   also through the gate, and give them for the building of the tower?"
   "Because," he answered, "these were the first who bore these spirits,
   and they never departed from each other, neither the spirits from the
   men nor the men from the spirits, but the spirits remained with them
   until their falling asleep. And unless they had had these spirits with
   them, they would not have been of use for the building of this tower."

      Chap. XVI.

   "Explain to me a little further, sir," I said. "What is it that you
   desire?" he asked. "Why, sir," I said, "did these stones ascend out of
   the pit, and be applied to the building of the tower, after having
   borne these spirits?" "They were obliged," he answered, "to ascend
   through water in order that they might be made alive; for, unless they
   laid aside the deadness of their life, they could not in any other way
   enter into the kingdom of God. Accordingly, those also who fell asleep
   received the seal of the Son of God. For," he continued, "before a man
   bears the name of the Son of God [371] he is dead; but when he receives
   the seal he lays aside his deadness, and obtains life. The seal, then,
   is the water: they descend into the water dead, and they arise alive.
   And to them, accordingly, was this seal preached, and they made use of
   it that they might enter into the kingdom of God." "Why, sir," I asked,
   "did the forty stones also ascend with them out of the pit, having
   already received the seal?" "Because," he said, "these apostles and
   teachers who preached the name of the Son of God, after falling asleep
   in the power and faith of the Son of God, preached it not only to those
   who were asleep, but themselves also gave them the seal of the
   preaching. Accordingly they descended with them into the water, and
   again ascended. [But these descended alive and rose up again alive;
   whereas they who had previously fallen asleep descended dead, but rose
   up again alive. [372] ] By these, then, were they quickened and made to
   know the name of the Son of God. For this reason also did they ascend
   with them, and were fitted along with them into the building of the
   tower, and, untouched by the chisel, were built in along with them. For
   they slept in righteousness and in great purity, but only they had not
   this seal. You have accordingly the explanation of these also."

      Chap. XVII.

   "I understand, sir," I replied. "Now, sir," I continued, "explain to
   me, with respect to the mountains, why their forms are various and
   diverse." "Listen," he said: "these mountains are the twelve tribes,
   which inhabit the whole world. [373] The Son of God, accordingly, was
   preached unto them by the apostles." "But why are the mountains of
   various kinds, some having one form, and others another? Explain that
   to me, sir." "Listen," he answered: "these twelve tribes that inhabit
   the whole world are twelve nations. And they vary in prudence and
   understanding. As numerous, then, as are the varieties of the mountains
   which you saw, are also the diversities of mind and understanding among
   these nations. And I will explain to you the actions of each one."
   "First, sir," I said, "explain this: why, when the mountains are so
   diverse, their stones, when placed in the building, became one colour,
   shining like those also that had ascended out of the pit." "Because,"
   he said, "all the nations that dwell under heaven were called by
   hearing and believing upon the name of the Son of God. [374] Having,
   therefore, received the seal, they had one understanding and one mind;
   and their faith became one, and their love one, and with the name they
   bore also the spirits of the virgins. [375] On this account the
   building of the tower became of one colour, bright as the sun. But
   after they had entered into the same place, and became one body,
   certain of these defiled themselves, and were expelled from the race of
   the righteous, and became again what they were before, or rather
   worse."

      Chap. XVIII.

   "How, sir," I said, "did they become worse, after having known God?"
   [376] "He that does not know God," he answered, "and practices evil,
   receives a certain chastisement for his wickedness; but he that has
   known God, ought not any longer to do evil, but to do good. If,
   accordingly, when he ought to do good, he do evil, does not he appear
   to do greater evil than he who does not know God? For this reason, they
   who have not known God and do evil are condemned to death; but they who
   have known God, and have seen His mighty works, and still continue in
   evil, shall be chastised doubly, and shall die for ever. [377] In this
   way, then, will the Church of God be purified. For as you saw the
   stones rejected from the tower, and delivered to the evil spirits, and
   cast out thence, so [they also shall be cast out, and [378] ] there
   shall be one body of the purified; as the tower also became, as it
   were, of one stone after its purification. In like manner also shall it
   be with the Church of God, after it has been purified, and has rejected
   the wicked, and the hypocrites, and the blasphemers, and the waverers,
   and those who commit wickedness of different kinds. After these have
   been cast away, the Church of God shall be one body, of one mind, of
   one understanding, of one faith, of one love. And then the Son of God
   will be exceeding glad, and shall rejoice over them, because He has
   received His people pure." [379] "All these things, sir," I said, "are
   great and glorious."

   "Moreover, sir," I said, "explain to me the power and the actions of
   each one of the mountains, that every soul, trusting in the Lord, and
   hearing it, may glorify His great, and marvellous, and glorious name."
   "Hear," he said, "the diversity of the mountains and of the twelve
   nations."

      Chap. XIX.

   "From the first mountain, which was black, they that believed are the
   following: apostates and blasphemers against the Lord, and betrayers of
   the servants of God. To these repentance is not open; but death lies
   before them, and on this account also are they black, for their race is
   a lawless one. And from the second mountain, which was bare, they who
   believed are the following: hypocrites, and teachers of wickedness. And
   these, accordingly, are like the former, not having any fruits of
   righteousness; for as their mountain was destitute of fruit, so also
   such men have a name indeed, but are empty of faith, and there is no
   fruit of truth in them. They indeed have repentance in their power, if
   they repent quickly; but if they are slow in so doing, they shall die
   along with the former." "Why, sir," I said, "have these repentance, but
   the former not? for their actions are nearly the same." "On this
   account," he said, "have these repentance, because they did not
   blaspheme their Lord, nor become betrayers of the servants of God; but
   on account of their desire of possessions they became hypocritical, and
   each one taught according to the desires of men that were sinners. But
   they will suffer a certain punishment; and repentance is before them,
   because they were not blasphemers or traitors."

      Chap. XX.

   "And from the third mountain, which had thorns and thistles, they who
   believed are the following. There are some of them rich, and others
   immersed in much business. The thistles are the rich, and the thorns
   are they who are immersed in much business. Those, [accordingly, who
   are entangled in many various kinds of business, do not [380] ] cleave
   to the servants of God, but wander away, being choked by their business
   transactions; and the rich cleave with difficulty to the servants of
   God, fearing lest these should ask something of them. Such persons,
   accordingly, shall have difficulty in entering the kingdom of God. For
   as it is disagreeable to walk among thistles with naked feet, so also
   it is hard for such to enter the kingdom of God. [381] But to all these
   repentance, and that speedy, is open, in order that what they did not
   do in former times they may make up for in these days, and do some
   good, and they shall live unto God. But if they abide in their deeds,
   they shall be delivered to those women, who will put them to death."

      Chap. XXI.

   "And from the fourth mountain, which had much grass, the upper parts of
   the plants green, and the parts about the roots withered, and some also
   scorched by the sun, they who believed are the following: the doubtful,
   and they who have the Lord upon their lips, but have Him not in their
   heart. On this account their foundations are withered, and have no
   strength; and their words alone live, while their works are dead. Such
   persons are [neither alive nor [382] ] dead. They resemble, therefore,
   the waverers: for the wavering are neither withered nor green, being
   neither living nor dead. For as their blades, on seeing the sun, were
   withered, so also the wavering, when they hear of affliction, on
   account of their fear, worship idols, and are ashamed of the name of
   their Lord. [383] Such, then, are neither alive nor dead. But these
   also may yet live, if they repent quickly; and if they do not repent,
   they are already delivered to the women, who take away their life."

      Chap. XXII.

   "And from the fifth mountain, which had green grass, and was rugged,
   they who believed are the following: believers, indeed, but slow to
   learn, and obstinate, and pleasing themselves, wishing to know
   everything, and knowing nothing at all. On account of this obstinacy of
   theirs, understanding departed from them, and foolish senselessness
   entered into them. And they praise themselves as having wisdom, and
   desire to become teachers, although destitute of sense. On account,
   therefore, of this loftiness of mind, many became vain, exalting
   themselves: for self-will and empty confidence is a great demon. Of
   these, accordingly, many were rejected, but some repented and believed,
   and subjected themselves to those that had understanding, knowing their
   own foolishness. And to the rest of this class repentance is open; for
   they were not wicked, but rather foolish, and without understanding. If
   these therefore repent, they will live unto God; but if they do not
   repent, they shall have their dwelling with the women who wrought
   wickedness among them."

      Chap. XXIII.

   "And those from the sixth mountain, which had clefts large and small,
   and decayed grass in the clefts, who believed, were the following: they
   who occupy the small clefts are those who bring charges against one
   another, and by reason of their slanders have decayed in the faith.
   Many of them, however, repented; and the rest also will repent when
   they hear my commandments, for their slanders are small, and they will
   quickly repent. But they who occupy the large clefts are persistent in
   their slanders, and vindictive in their anger against each other.
   These, therefore, were thrown away from the tower, and rejected from
   having a part in its building. Such persons, accordingly, shall have
   difficulty in living. If our God and Lord, who rules over all things,
   and has power over all His creation, does not remember evil against
   those who confess their sins, but is merciful, does man, who is
   corruptible and full of sins, remember evil against a fellow-man, as if
   he were able to destroy or to save him? [384] I, the angel of
   repentance, say unto you, As many of you as are of this way of
   thinking, lay it aside, and repent, and the Lord will heal your former
   sins, if you purify yourselves from this demon; but if not, you will be
   delivered over to him for death."

      Chap. XXIV.

   "And those who believed from the seventh mountain, on which the grass
   was green and flourishing, and the whole of the mountain fertile, and
   every kind of cattle and the fowls of heaven were feeding on the grass
   on this mountain, and the grass on which they pastured became more
   abundant, were the following: they were always simple, and harmless,
   and blessed, bringing no charges against one another, but always
   rejoicing greatly because of the servants of God, and being clothed
   with the holy spirit of these virgins, and always having pity on every
   man, and giving aid from their own labour to every man, without
   reproach and without hesitation. [385] The Lord, therefore, seeing
   their simplicity and all their meekness, multiplied them amid the
   labours of their hands, and gave them grace in all their doings. And I,
   the angel of repentance, say to you who are such, Continue to be such
   as these, and your seed will never be blotted out; for the Lord has
   made trial of you, and inscribed you in the number of us, and the whole
   of your seed will dwell with the Son of God; for ye have received of
   His Spirit."

      Chap. XXV.

   "And they who believed from the eighth mountain, where were the many
   fountains, and where all the creatures of God drank of the fountains,
   were the following: apostles, and teachers, who preached to the whole
   world, and who taught solemnly and purely the word of the Lord, and did
   not at all fall into evil desires, but walked always in righteousness
   and truth, according as they had received the Holy Spirit. Such
   persons, therefore, shall enter in with the angels." [386]

      Chap. XXVI.

   "And they who believed from the ninth mountain, which was deserted, and
   had in it creeping things and wild beasts which destroy men, were the
   following: they who had the stains as servants, [387] who discharged
   their duty ill, and who plundered widows and orphans of their
   livelihood, and gained possessions for themselves from the ministry,
   which they had received. [388] If, therefore, they remain under the
   dominion of the same desire, they are dead, and there is no hope of
   life for them; but if they repent, and finish their ministry in a holy
   manner, they shall be able to live. And they who were covered with
   scabs are those who have denied their Lord, and have not returned to
   Him again; but becoming withered and desert-like, and not cleaving to
   the servants of God, but living in solitude, they destroy their own
   souls. For as a vine, when left within an enclosure, and meeting with
   neglect, is destroyed, and is made desolate by the weeds, and in time
   grows wild, and is no longer of any use to its master, so also are such
   men as have given themselves up, and become useless to their Lord, from
   having contracted savage habits. These men, therefore, have repentance
   in their power, unless they are found to have denied from the heart;
   but if any one is found to have denied from the heart, I do not know if
   he may live. And I say this not for these present days, in order that
   any one who has denied may obtain repentance, for it is impossible for
   him to be saved who now intends to deny his Lord; but to those who
   denied Him long ago, repentance seems to be possible. If, therefore,
   any one intends to repent, let him do so quickly, before the tower is
   completed; for if not, he will be utterly destroyed by the women. And
   the chipped stones are the deceitful and the slanderers; and the wild
   beasts which you saw on the ninth mountain, are the same. For as wild
   beasts destroy and kill a man by their poison, so also do the words of
   such men destroy and ruin a man. These, accordingly, are mutilated in
   their faith, on account of the deeds which they have done in
   themselves; yet some repented, and were saved. And the rest, who are of
   such a character, can be saved if they repent; but if they do not
   repent, they will perish with those women, whose strength they have
   assumed."

      Chap. XXVII.

   "And from the tenth mountain, where were trees which overshadowed
   certain sheep, they who believed were the following: bishops [389]
   given to hospitality, who always gladly received into their houses the
   servants of God, without dissimulation. And the bishops never failed to
   protect, by their service, the widows, and those who were in want, and
   always maintained a holy conversation. All these, accordingly, shall be
   protected by the Lord for ever. They who do these things are honourable
   before God, and their place is already with the angels, if they remain
   to the end serving God."

      Chap. XXVIII.

   "And from the eleventh mountain, where were trees full of fruits,
   adorned with fruits of various kinds, they who believed were the
   following: they who suffered for the name of the Son of God, and who
   also suffered cheerfully with their whole heart, and laid down their
   lives." "Why, then, sir," I said, "do all these trees bear fruit, and
   some of them fairer than the rest?" "Listen," he said: "all who once
   suffered for the name of the Lord are honourable before God; and of all
   these the sins were remitted, because they suffered for the name of the
   Son of God. [390] And why their fruits are of various kinds, and some
   of them superior, listen. All," he continued, "who were brought before
   the authorities and were examined, and did not deny, but suffered
   cheerfully--these are held in greater honour with God, and of these the
   fruit is superior; but all who were cowards, and in doubt, and who
   reasoned in their hearts whether they would deny or confess, and yet
   suffered, of these the fruit is less, because that suggestion came into
   their hearts; for that suggestion--that a servant should deny his
   Lord--is evil. Have a care, therefore, ye who are planning such things,
   lest that suggestion remain in your hearts, and ye perish unto God. And
   ye who suffer for His name ought to glorify God, because He deemed you
   worthy to bear His name, that all your sins might be healed.
   [Therefore, rather deem yourselves happy], and think that ye have done
   a great thing, if any of you suffer on account of God. The Lord bestows
   upon you life, and ye do not understand, for your sins were heavy; but
   if you had not suffered for the name of the Lord, ye would have died to
   God on account of your sins. These things I say to you who are
   hesitating about denying or confessing: acknowledge that ye have the
   Lord, lest, denying Him, ye be delivered up to prison. If the heathen
   chastise their slaves, when one of them denies his master, what, think
   ye, will your Lord do, who has authority over all men? Put away these
   counsels out of your hearts, that you may live continually unto God."

      Chap. XXIX.

   "And they who believed from the twelfth mountain, which was white, are
   the following: they are as infant children, in whose hearts no evil
   originates; nor did they know what wickedness is, but always remained
   as children. Such accordingly, without doubt, dwell in the kingdom of
   God, because they defiled in nothing the commandments of God; but they
   remained like children all the days of their life in the same mind. All
   of you, then, who shall remain stedfast, and be as children, [391]
   without doing evil, will be more honoured than all who have been
   previously mentioned; for all infants are honourable before God, and
   are the first persons with Him. [392] Blessed, then, are ye who put
   away wickedness from yourselves, and put on innocence. As the first of
   all will you live unto God."

   After he had finished the similitudes of the mountains, I said to him,
   "Sir, explain to me now about the stones that were taken out of the
   plain, and put into the building instead of the stones that were taken
   out of the tower; and about the round stones that were put into the
   building; and those that still remain round."

      Chap. XXX.

   "Hear," he answered, "about all these also. The stones taken out of the
   plain and put into the building of the tower instead of those that were
   rejected, are the roots of this white mountain. When, therefore, they
   who believed from the white mountain were all found guileless, the Lord
   of the tower commanded those from the roots of this mountain to be cast
   into the building of the tower; for he knew that if these stones were
   to go to the building of the tower, they would remain bright, and not
   one of them become black. [393] But if he had so resolved with respect
   to the other mountains, it would have been necessary for him to visit
   that tower again, and to cleanse it. Now all these persons were found
   white who believed, and who will yet believe, for they are of the same
   race. This is a happy race, because it is innocent. Hear now, further,
   about these round and shining stones. All these also are from the white
   mountain. Hear, moreover, why they were found round: because their
   riches had obscured and darkened them a little from the truth, although
   they never departed from God; nor did any evil word proceed out of
   their mouth, but all justice, virtue, and truth. When the Lord,
   therefore, saw the mind of these persons, that they were born good,
   [394] and could be good, He ordered their riches to be cut down, not to
   be taken [395] away for ever, that they might be able to do some good
   with what was left them; and they will live unto God, because they are
   of a good race. Therefore were they rounded a little by the chisel, and
   put in the building of the tower.

      Chap. XXXI.

   "But the other round stones, which had not yet been adapted to the
   building of the tower, and had not yet received the seal, were for this
   reason put back into their place, because they are exceedingly round.
   Now this age must be cut down in these things, and in the vanities of
   their riches, and then they will meet in the kingdom of God; for they
   must of necessity enter into the kingdom of God, because the Lord has
   blessed this innocent race. Of this race, therefore, no one will
   perish; for although any of them be tempted by the most wicked devil,
   and commit sin, he will quickly return to his Lord. I deem you happy,
   I, who am the messenger of repentance, whoever of you are innocent as
   children, [396] because your part is good, and honourable before God.
   Moreover, I say to you all, who have received the seal of the Son of
   God, be clothed with simplicity, and be not mindful of offences, nor
   remain in wickedness. Lay aside, therefore, the recollection of your
   offences and bitternesses, and you will be formed in one spirit. And
   heal and take away from you those wicked schisms, that if the Lord of
   the flocks come, He may rejoice concerning you. And He will rejoice, if
   He find all things sound, and none of you shall perish. But if He find
   any one of these sheep strayed, woe to the shepherds! And if the
   shepherds themselves have strayed, what answer will they give Him for
   their flocks? [397] Will they perchance say that they were harassed by
   their flocks? They will not be believed, for the thing is incredible
   that a shepherd could suffer from his flock; rather will he be punished
   on account of his falsehood. And I myself am a shepherd, and I am under
   a most stringent necessity of rendering an account of you.

      Chap. XXXII.

   "Heal yourselves, therefore, while the tower is still building. The
   Lord dwells in men that love peace, because He loved peace; but from
   the contentious and the utterly wicked He is far distant. Restore to
   Him, therefore, a spirit sound as ye received it. For when you have
   given to a fuller a new garment, and desire to receive it back entire
   at the end, if, then, the fuller return you a torn garment, will you
   take it from him, and not rather be angry, and abuse him, saying, I
   gave you a garment that was entire: why have you rent it, and made it
   useless, so that it can be of no use on account of the rent which you
   have made in it?' Would you not say all this to the fuller about the
   rent which you found in your garment? If, therefore, you grieve about
   your garment, and complain because you have not received it entire,
   what do you think the Lord will do to you, who gave you a sound spirit,
   which you have rendered altogether useless, so that it can be of no
   service to its possessor? for its use began to be unprofitable, seeing
   it was corrupted by you. Will not the Lord, therefore, because of this
   conduct of yours regarding His Spirit, act in the same way, and deliver
   you over to death? Assuredly, I say, he will do the same to all those
   whom He shall find retaining a recollection of offences. [398] Do not
   trample His mercy under foot, He says, but rather honour Him, because
   He is so patient with your sins, and is not as ye are. Repent, for it
   is useful to you."

      Chap. XXXIII.

   "All these things which are written above, I, the Shepherd, the
   messenger of repentance, have showed and spoken to the servants of God.
   [399] If therefore ye believe, and listen to my words, and walk in
   them, and amend your ways, you shall have it in your power to live: but
   if you remain in wickedness, and in the recollection of offences, no
   sinner of that class will live unto God. All these words which I had to
   say have been spoken unto you."

   The Shepherd said to me, "Have you asked me everything?" And I replied,
   "Yes, sir." "Why did you not ask me about the shape of the stones that
   were put into the building, that I might explain to you why we filled
   up the shapes?" And I said, "I forgot, sir." "Hear now, then," he said,
   "about this also. These are they who have now heard my commandments,
   and repented with their whole hearts. And when the Lord saw that their
   repentance was good and pure, and that they were able to remain in it,
   He ordered their former sins to be blotted out. [400] For these shapes
   were their sins, and they were levelled down, that they might not
   appear."

   unintelligible. Amid the abominations of heathenism, it taught a lesson

   discipline of the whole Chuirch. The lesson is, that what "begins in
   the spirit" may "end in the flesh." Those who shunning the horrible

   In this vision, Hermas resorted to "watching and praying;" and the

   accepted such truths like innocent children, and loved them. They

   Himself as to the awards (Matt. xx. 21-23) of mercy to fruits of grace:

      Concerning Repentance and Alms-Giving.

      Chap. I.

   After I had fully written down this book, that messenger who had
   delivered me to the Shepherd came into the house in which I was, and
   sat down upon a couch, and the Shepherd stood on his right hand. He
   then called me, and spoke to me as follows: "I have delivered you and
   your house to the Shepherd, that you may be protected by him." "Yes,
   sir," I said. "If you wish, therefore, to be protected," he said, "from
   all annoyance, and from all harsh treatment, and to have success in
   every good work and word, and to possess all the virtues of
   righteousness, walk in these commandments which he has given you, and
   you will be able to subdue all wickedness. For if you keep those
   commandments, every desire and pleasure of the world will be subject to
   you, and success will attend you in every good work. Take unto yourself
   his experience and moderation, and say to all that he is in great
   honour and dignity with God, and that he is a president with great
   power, and mighty in his office. To him alone throughout the whole
   world is the power of repentance assigned. Does he seem to you to be
   powerful? But you despise his experience, and the moderation which he
   exercises towards you."

      Chap. II.

   I said to him, "Ask himself, sir, whether from the time that he has
   entered my house I have done anything improper, or have offended him in
   any respect." He answered, "I also know that you neither have done nor
   will do anything improper, and therefore I speak these words to you,
   that you may persevere. For he had a good report of you to me, and you
   will say these words to others, that they also who have either repented
   or will still repent may entertain the same feelings with you, and he
   may report well of these to me, and I to the Lord." And I said, "Sir, I
   make known to every man the great works of God: and I hope that all
   those who love them, and have sinned before, on hearing these words,
   may repent, and receive life again." "Continue, therefore, in this
   ministry, and finish it. And all who follow out his commands shall have
   life, and great honour with the Lord. [401] But those who do not keep
   his commandments, flee from his life, and despise him. But he has his
   own honour with the Lord. All, therefore, who shall despise him, [402]
   and not follow his commands, deliver themselves to death, and every one
   of them will be guilty of his own blood. But I enjoin you, that you
   obey his commands, and you will have a cure for your former sins."

      Chap. III.

   "Moreover, I sent you these virgins, that they may dwell with you.
   [403] For I saw that they were courteous to you. You will therefore
   have them as assistants, that you may be the better able to keep his
   commands: for it is impossible that these commandments can be observed
   without these virgins. I see, moreover, that they abide with you
   willingly; but I will also instruct them not to depart at all from your
   house: do you only keep your house pure, as they will delight to dwell
   in a pure abode. For they are pure, and chaste, and industrious, and
   have all influence with the Lord. Therefore, if they find your house to
   be pure, they will remain with you; but if any defilement, even a
   little, befall it, they will immediately withdraw from your house. For
   these virgins do not at all like any defilement." I said to him, "I
   hope, sir, that I will please them, so that they may always be willing
   to inhabit my house. And as he to whom you entrusted me has no
   complaint against me, so neither will they have." He said to the
   Shepherd, "I see that the servant of God wishes to live, and to keep
   these commandments, and will place these virgins in a pure habitation."
   [404] When he had spoken these words he again delivered me to the
   Shepherd, and called those virgins, and said to them, "Since I see that
   you are willing to dwell in his house, I commend him and his house to
   you, asking that you withdraw not at all from it." And the virgins
   heard these words with pleasure.

      Chap. IV.

   The angel [405] then said to me, "Conduct yourself manfully in this
   service, and make known to every one the great things of God, [406] and
   you will have favour in this ministry. Whoever, therefore, shall walk
   in these commandments, shall have life, and will be happy in his life;
   but whosoever shall neglect them shall not have life, and will be
   unhappy in this life. Enjoin all, who are able to act rightly, not to
   cease well-doing; for, to practice good works is useful to them. [407]
   And I say that every man ought to be saved from inconveniences. For
   both he who is in want, and he who suffers inconveniences in his daily
   life, is in great torture and necessity. Whoever, therefore, rescues a
   soul of this kind from necessity, will gain for himself great joy. For
   he who is harassed by inconveniences of this kind, suffers equal
   torture with him who is in chains. Moreover many, on account of
   calamities of this sort, when they could not endure them, hasten their
   own deaths. Whoever, then, knows a calamity of this kind afflicting a
   man, and does not save him, commits a great sin, and becomes guilty of
   his blood. [408] Do good works, therefore, ye who have received good
   from the Lord; lest, while ye delay to do them, the building of the
   tower be finished, and you be rejected from the edifice: there is now
   no other tower a-building. For on your account was the work of building
   suspended. Unless, then, you make haste to do rightly, the tower will
   be completed, and you will be excluded."

   After he had spoken with me he rose up from the couch, and taking the
   Shepherd and the virgins, he departed. But he said to me that he would
   send back the Shepherd and the virgins to my dwelling. Amen. [409]

   and commandments, and similitudes of the prophet Hermas, who is Paul,
   in the year 191 of mercy, 23d night and 22d day of the month," etc. The

   Acts xiv. 12.

  Elucidations.

    I.

   The reader has now had an opportunity of judging for himself whether
   the internal evidence favours any other view of the authorship of The
   Shepherd, than that which I have adopted. Its apparent design is to
   meet the rising pestilence of Montanism, and the perils of a secondary
   stage of Christianity. This it attempts to do by an imaginary voice
   from the first period. Avoiding controversy, Hermas presents, in the
   name of his earlier synonyme, a portraiture of the morals and practical
   godliness which were recognised as "the way of holiness" in the
   apostolic days. In so doing, he falls into anachronisms, of course, as
   poets and romancers must. These are sufficiently numerous to reveal the
   nature of his production, and to prove that the author was not the
   Hermas of the story.

   The authorship was a puzzle and a problem during the earlier
   discussions of the learned. An anonymous poem (falsely ascribed to
   Tertullian, but very ancient) did, indeed, give a clue to the
   solution:--


   "--deinde Pius, Hermas cui germine frater,

   Angelicus Pastor, quia tradita verba locutus."

   To say that there was no evidence to sustain this, is to grant that it
   doubles the evidence when sufficient support for it is discovered. This
   was supplied by the fragment found in Milan, by the erudite and
   indefatigable Muratori, about a hundred and fifty years ago. Its
   history, with very valuable notes on the fragment itself, which is
   given entire, may be found in Routh's Reliquiæ. [410] Or the English
   reader may consult Westcott's very luminous statement of the case.
   [411] I am sorry that Dr. Donaldson doubts and objects; but he would
   not deny that experts, at least his equals, [412] accept the Muratorian
   Canon, which carries with it the historic testimony needed in the case
   of Hermas. All difficulties disappear in the light of this evidence.
   Hermas was brother of Pius, ninth Bishop of Rome (after Hyginus, circ.
   a.d. 157), and wrote his prose idyl under the fiction of his Pauline
   predecessor's name and age. This accounts (1) for the existence of the
   work, (2) for its form of allegory and prophesying, (3) for its
   anachronisms, (4) for its great currency, and (5) for its circulation
   among the Easterns, which was greater than it enjoyed in the West; and
   also (6) for their innocent mistake in ascribing it to the elder
   Hermas.

   1. The Phrygian enthusiasm, like the convulsionism of Paris [413] in
   the last century, was a phenomenon not to be trifled with; especially
   when it began to threaten the West. This work was produced to meet so
   great an emergency.

   2. "Fire fights fire," and prophesyings are best met by prophesyings.
   These were rare among the Orthodox, but Hermas undertook to restore
   those of the apostolic age; and I think this is what is meant by the
   tradita verba of the old poem, i.e., words "transmitted or bequeathed
   traditionally" from the times of Clement. Irenæus, the contemporary of
   this Hermas, had received the traditions of the same age from Polycarp:
   hence the greater probability of my conjecture that the brother of Pius
   compiled many traditional prophesyings of the first age.

   3. Supposing the work to be in fact what it is represented to be in
   fiction, we have seen that it abounds with anachronisms. As now
   explained, we can account for them: the second Hermas forgets himself,
   like other poets, and mixes up his own period with that which he
   endeavours to portray.

   4 and 5. Written in Greek, its circulation in the West was necessarily
   limited; but, as the plague of Montanism was raging in the East, its
   Greek was a godsend, and enabled the Easterns to introduce it
   everywhere as a useful book. Origen values it as such; and, taking it
   without thought to be the work of the Pauline Hermas, attributes to it,
   as a fancy of his own, [414] that kind of inspiration which pertained
   to early "prophesyings." This conjecture once started, "it satisfied
   curiosity," says Westcott, "and supplied the place of more certain
   information; but, though it found acceptance, it acquired no new
   strength." [415]

   6. Eusebius and Jerome [416] merely repeat the report as an on dit, and
   on this slender authority it travelled down. The Pauline Hermas was
   credited with it; and the critics, in their researches, find multiplied
   traces of the one mistake, as did the traveller whose circuits became a
   beaten road under the hoofs of his own horse.

   If the reader will now turn back to the Introductory Note of the
   Edinburgh editors, he will find that the three views of which they take
   any serious notice are harmonized by that we have reached. (1) The work
   is unquestionably, on its face, the work of the Pauline Hermas. (2) But
   this is attributable to the fact that it is a fiction, or prose poem.
   (3) And hence it must be credited to the later Hermas, whose name and
   authorship are alone supported by external testimony, as well as
   internal evidence.

    II.

   (Similitude Ninth, cap. xi. p. 47, [3]note 1.)

   Westcott is undoubtedly correct in connecting this strange passage with
   one of the least defensible experiments of early Christian living.
   Gibbon finds in this experiment nothing but an opportunity for his
   scurrility. [417] A true philosopher will regard it very differently;
   and here, once and for all, we may speak of it somewhat at length. The
   young believer, a member, perhaps, of a heathen family, daily mixed up
   with abominable manners, forced to meet everywhere, by day, the
   lascivious hetæræ of the Greeks or those who are painted by Martial
   among the Latins, had no refuge but in flying to the desert, or
   practising the most heroic self-restraint if he remained with the
   relations and companions of his youth. If he went to the bath, it was
   to see naked women wallowing with vile men: if he slept upon the
   housetop, it was to throw down his mat or rug in a promiscuous stye of
   men and women. [418] This alike with rich and poor; but the latter were
   those among whom the Gospel found its more numerous recruits, and it
   was just these who were least able to protect themselves from
   pollutions. Their only resource was in that self-mastery, out of which
   sprung the Encraty of Tatian and the Montanism of Tertullian. Angelic
   purity was supposed to be attainable in this life; and the experiment
   was doubtless attended with some success, among the more resolute in
   fastings and prayer. Inevitably, however, what was "begun in the
   spirit," ended "in the flesh," in many instances. To live as brothers
   and sisters in the family of Christ, was a daring experiment;
   especially in such a social atmosphere, and amid the domestic habits of
   the heathen. Scandals ensued. Canonical censures were made stringent by
   the Church; and, while the vices of men and the peril of persecution
   multiplied the anchorites of the desert, this mischief was crushed out,
   and made impossible for Christians. "The sun-clad power of chastity,"
   which Hermas means to depict, was no doubt gloriously exemplified among
   holy men and women, in those heroic ages. The power of the Holy Ghost
   demonstrated, in many instances, how true it is, that, "to the pure,
   all things are pure." But the Gospel proscribes everything like
   presumption and "leading into temptation." The Church, in dealing with
   social evils, often encouraged a recourse to monasticism, in its pure
   form; but this also tended to corruption. To charge Christianity,
   however, with rash experiments of living which it never tolerated, is
   neither just nor philosophical. We have in it an example of the
   struggles of individuals out of heathenism,--by no means an institution
   of Christianity itself. It was a struggle, which, in its spirit,
   demands sympathy and respect. The Gospel has taught us to nauseate what
   even a regenerated heathen conceived to be praiseworthy, until the
   Christian family had become a developed product of the Church. [419]

   The Gospel arms its enemies against itself, by elevating them
   infinitely above what they would have been without its influences.
   Refined by its social atmosphere, but refusing its sanctifying power,
   they gloat over the failures and falls of those with whom their own
   emancipation was begun. Let us rather admire those whom she lifted out
   of an abyss of moral degradation, but whose struggles to reach the high
   levels of her precepts were not always successful. Yet these very
   struggles were heroic; for all their original habits, and all their
   surroundings, were of the sort "which hardens all within, and petrifies
   the feeling."

   The American editor has devoted more than his usual amount of
   annotation to Hermas, and he affectionately asks the student not to
   overlook the notes, in which he has condensed rather than amplified
   exposition. It has been a labour of love to contribute something to a
   just conception of The Shepherd, because the Primitive Age has often
   been reproached with its good repute in the early churches. So little
   does one generation comprehend another! When Christians conscientiously
   rejected the books of the heathen, and had as yet none of their own,
   save the Sacred Scriptures, or such scanty portions of the New
   Testament as were the treasures of the churches, is it wonderful that
   the first effort at Christian allegory was welcomed, especially in a
   time of need and perilous temptation?

  Introductory Note

    to

Taitian the Assyrian
     __________________________________________________________________

   [Translated by J. E. Ryland.]

   [a.d. 110-172.] It was my first intention to make this author a mere
   appendix to his master, Justin Martyr; for he stands in an equivocal
   position, as half Father and half heretic. His good seems to have been
   largely due to Justin's teaching and influence. One may trust that his
   falling away, in the decline of life, is attributable to infirmity of
   mind and body; his severe asceticism countenancing this charitable
   thought. Many instances of human frailty, which the experience of ages
   has taught Christians to view with compassion rather than censure, are
   doubtless to be ascribed to mental aberration and decay. Early
   Christians had not yet been taught this lesson; for, socially, neither
   Judaism nor Paganism had wholly surrendered their unloving influences
   upon their minds. Moreover, their high valuation of discipline, as an
   essential condition of self-preservation amid the fires of surrounding
   scorn and hatred, led them to practice, perhaps too sternly, upon
   offenders, what they often heroically performed upon themselves,--the
   amputation of the scandalous hand, or the plucking out of the evil eye.

   In Tatian, another Assyrian follows the Star of Bethlehem, from
   Euphrates and the Tigris. The scanty facts of his personal history are
   sufficiently detailed by the translator, in his Introductory Note. We
   owe to himself the pleasing story of his conversion from heathenism.
   But I think it important to qualify the impressions the translation may
   otherwise leave upon the student's mind, by a little more sympathy with
   the better side of his character, and a more just statement of his
   great services to the infant Church.

   His works, which were very numerous, have perished, in consequence of
   his lapse from orthodoxy. Give him due credit for his Diatessaron, of
   which the very name is a valuable testimony to the Four Gospels as
   recognised by the primitive churches. It is lost, with the "infinite
   number" of other books which St. Jerome attributes to him. All honour
   to this earliest harmonist for such a work; and let us believe, with
   Mill and other learned authorities, that, if Eusebius had seen the work
   he censures, he might have expressed himself more charitably concerning
   it.

   We know something of Tatian, already, from the melancholy pages of
   Irenæus. Theodoret finds no other fault with his Diatessaron than its
   omission of the genealogies, which he, probably, could not harmonize on
   any theory of his own. The errors into which he fell in his old age
   [420] were so absurd, and so contrary to the Church's doctrine and
   discipline, that he could not be tolerated as one of the faithful,
   without giving to the heathen new grounds for the malignant slanders
   with which they were ever assailing the Christians. At the same time,
   let us reflect, that his fall is to be attributed to extravagant ideas
   of that encraty which is a precept of the Gospel, and which a pure
   abhorrence of pagan abominations led many of the orthodox to practice
   with extreme rigidity. And this is the place to say, once for all, that
   the figures of Elijah upon Mt. Carmel and of John Baptist in the
   wilderness, approved by our Lord's teachings, but moderated, as a
   lesson to others, by his own holy but less austere example, justify the
   early Church in making room for the two classes of Christians which
   must always be found in earnest religion, and which seem to have their
   warrant in the fundamental constitution of human nature. There must be
   men like St. Paul, living in the world, though not of it; and there
   must be men like the Baptist, of whom the world will say, "he hath a
   devil." Marvellously the early Catholics were piloted between the rocks
   and the whirlpools, in the narrow drift of the Gospel; and always the
   Holy Spirit of counsel and might was their guardian, amid their
   terrible trials and temptations. This must suggest, to every reflecting
   mind, a gratitude the most profound. To preserve evangelical encraty,
   and to restrain fanatical asceticism, was the spirit of early
   Christianity, as one sees in the ethics of Hermas. But the awful
   malaria of Montanism was even now rising like a fog of the marshes, and
   was destined to leave its lasting impress upon Western Christianity;
   "forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats." Our
   author, alas, laid the egg which Tertullian hatched, and invented terms
   which that great author raised to their highest power; for he was
   rather the disciple of Tatian than of the Phrygians, though they
   kindled his strange fire. After Tertullian, the whole subject of
   marriage became entangled with sophistries, which have ever since
   adhered to the Latin churches, and introduced the most corrosive
   results into the vitals of individuals and of nations. Southey
   suggests, that, in the Roman Communion, John Wesley would have been
   accommodated with full scope for his genius, and canonized as a saint,
   while his Anglican mother had no place for him. [421] But, on the other
   hand, let us reflect that while Rome had no place for Wiclif and Hus,
   or Jerome of Prague, she has used and glorified and canonized many
   fanatics whose errors were far more disgraceful than those of Tatian
   and Tertullian. In fact, she would have utilized and beatified these
   very enthusiasts, had they risen in the Middle Ages, to combine their
   follies with equal extravagance in persecuting the Albigenses, while
   aggrandizing the papal ascendency.

   I have enlarged upon the equivocal character of Tatian with melancholy
   interest, because I shall make sparing use of notes, in editing his
   sole surviving work, pronounced by Eusebius his masterpiece. I read it
   with sympathy, admiration, and instruction. I enjoy his biting satire
   of heathenism, his Pauline contempt for all philosophy save that of the
   Gospel, his touching reference to his own experiences, and his
   brilliant delineation of Christian innocence and of his own
   emancipation from the seductions of a deceitful and transient world. In
   short, I feel that Tatian deserves critical editing, in the original,
   at the hand and heart of some expert who can thoroughly appreciate his
   merits, and his relations to primitive Christianity.

   The following is the original Introductory Notice:--

   We learn from several sources that Tatian was an Assyrian, but know
   nothing very definite either as to the time or place of his birth.
   Epiphanius (Hær., xlvi.) declares that he was a native of Mesopotamia;
   and we infer from other ascertained facts regarding him, that he
   flourished about the middle of the second century. He was at first an
   eager student of heathen literature, and seems to have been especially
   devoted to researches in philosophy. But he found no satisfaction in
   the bewildering mazes of Greek speculation, while he became utterly
   disgusted with what heathenism presented to him under the name of
   religion. In these circumstances, he happily met with the sacred books
   of the Christians, and was powerfully attracted by the purity of morals
   which these inculcated, and by the means of deliverance from the
   bondage of sin which they revealed. He seems to have embraced
   Christianity at Rome, where he became acquainted with Justin Martyr,
   and enjoyed the instructions of that eminent teacher of the Gospel.
   After the death of Justin, Tatian unfortunately fell under the
   influence of the Gnostic heresy, and founded an ascetic sect, which,
   from the rigid principles it professed, was called that of the
   Encratites, that is, "The self-controlled," or, "The masters of
   themselves." Tatian latterly established himself at Antioch, and
   acquired a considerable number of disciples, who continued after his
   death to be distinguished by the practice of those austerities which he
   had enjoined. The sect of the Encratites is supposed to have been
   established about a.d. 166, and Tatian appears to have died some few
   years afterwards.

   The only extant work of Tatian is his "Address to the Greeks." It is a
   most unsparing and direct exposure of the enormities of heathenism.
   Several other works are said to have been composed by Tatian; and of
   these, a Diatessaron, or Harmony of the Four Gospels, is specially
   mentioned. His Gnostic views led him to exclude from the continuous
   narrative of our Lord's life, given in this work, all those passages
   which bear upon the incarnation and true humanity of Christ. Not
   withstanding this defect, we cannot but regret the loss of this
   earliest Gospel harmony; but the very title it bore is important, as
   showing that the Four Gospels, and these only, were deemed
   authoritative about the middle of the second century.

      Chapter I.--The Greeks Claim, Without Reason, the Invention of the Arts.

   Be not, O Greeks, so very hostilely disposed towards the Barbarians,
   nor look with ill will on their opinions. For which of your
   institutions has not been derived from the Barbarians? The most eminent
   of the Telmessians invented the art of divining by dreams; the Carians,
   that of prognosticating by the stars; the Phrygians and the most
   ancient Isaurians, augury by the flight of birds; the Cyprians, the art
   of inspecting victims. To the Babylonians you owe astronomy; to the
   Persians, magic; to the Egyptians, geometry; to the Phoenicians,
   instruction by alphabetic writing. Cease, then, to miscall these
   imitations inventions of your own. Orpheus, again, taught you poetry
   and song; from him, too, you learned the mysteries. The Tuscans taught
   you the plastic art; from the annals of the Egyptians you learned to
   write history; you acquired the art of playing the flute from Marsyas
   and Olympus,--these two rustic Phrygians constructed the harmony of the
   shepherd's pipe. The Tyrrhenians invented the trumpet; the Cyclopes,
   the smith's art; and a woman who was formerly a queen of the Persians,
   as Hellanicus tells us, the method of joining together epistolary
   tablets: [422] her name was Atossa. Wherefore lay aside this conceit,
   and be not ever boasting of your elegance of diction; for, while you
   applaud yourselves, your own people will of course side with you. But
   it becomes a man of sense to wait for the testimony of others, and it
   becomes men to be of one accord also in the pronunciation of their
   language. But, as matters stand, to you alone it has happened not to
   speak alike even in common intercourse; for the way of speaking among
   the Dorians is not the same as that of the inhabitants of Attica, nor
   do the Æolians speak like the Ionians. And, since such a discrepancy
   exists where it ought not to be, I am at a loss whom to call a Greek.
   And, what is strangest of all, you hold in honour expressions not of
   native growth, and by the intermixture of barbaric words have made your
   language a medley. On this account we have renounced your wisdom,
   though I was once a great proficient in it; for, as the comic poet
   [423] says,--


   These are gleaners' grapes and small talk,--

   Twittering places of swallows, corrupters of art.

   Yet those who eagerly pursue it shout lustily, and croak like so many
   ravens. You have, too, contrived the art of rhetoric to serve injustice
   and slander, selling the free power of your speech for hire, and often
   representing the same thing at one time as right, at another time as
   not good. The poetic art, again, you employ to describe battles, and
   the amours of the gods, and the corruption of the soul.

      Chapter II.--The Vices and Errors of the Philosophers.

   What noble thing have you produced by your pursuit of philosophy? Who
   of your most eminent men has been free from vain boasting? Diogenes,
   who made such a parade of his independence with his tub, was seized
   with a bowel complaint through eating a raw polypus, and so lost his
   life by gluttony. Aristippus, walking about in a purple robe, led a
   profligate life, in accordance with his professed opinions. Plato, a
   philosopher, was sold by Dionysius for his gormandizing propensities.
   And Aristotle, who absurdly placed a limit to Providence and made
   happiness to consist in the things which give pleasure, quite contrary
   to his duty as a preceptor flattered Alexander, forgetful that he was
   but a youth; and he, showing how well he had learned the lessons of his
   master, because his friend would not worship him shut him up and and
   carried him about like a bear or a leopard. He in fact obeyed strictly
   the precepts of his teacher in displaying manliness and courage by
   feasting, and transfixing with his spear his intimate and most beloved
   friend, and then, under a semblance of grief, weeping and starving
   himself, that he might not incur the hatred of his friends. I could
   laugh at those also who in the present day adhere to his
   tenets,--people who say that sublunary things are not under the care of
   Providence; and so, being nearer the earth than the moon, and below its
   orbit, they themselves look after what is thus left uncared for; and as
   for those who have neither beauty, nor wealth, nor bodily strength, nor
   high birth, they have no happiness, according to Aristotle. Let such
   men philosophize, for me!
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter III.--Ridicule of the Philosophers.

   I cannot approve of Heraclitus, who, being self-taught and arrogant,
   said, "I have explored myself." Nor can I praise him for hiding his
   poem [424] in the temple of Artemis, in order that it might be
   published afterwards as a mystery; and those who take an interest in
   such things say that Euripides the tragic poet came there and read it,
   and, gradually learning it by heart, carefully handed down to posterity
   this darkness [425] of Heraclitus. Death, however, demonstrated the
   stupidity of this man; for, being attacked by dropsy, as he had studied
   the art of medicine as well as philosophy, he plastered himself with
   cow-dung, which, as it hardened, contracted the flesh of his whole
   body, so that he was pulled in pieces, and thus died. Then, one cannot
   listen to Zeno, who declares that at the conflagration the same man
   will rise again to perform the same actions as before; for instance,
   Anytus and Miletus to accuse, Busiris to murder his guests, and
   Hercules to repeat his labours; and in this doctrine of the
   conflagration he introduces more wicked than just persons--one Socrates
   and a Hercules, and a few more of the same class, but not many, for the
   bad will be found far more numerous than the good. And according to him
   the Deity will manifestly be the author of evil, dwelling in sewers and
   worms, and in the perpetrators of impiety. The eruptions of fire in
   Sicily, moreover, confute the empty boasting of Empedocles, in that,
   though he was no god, he falsely almost gave himself out for one. I
   laugh, too, at the old wife's talk of Pherecydes, and the doctrine
   inherited from him by Pythagoras, and that of Plato, an imitation of
   his, though some think otherwise. And who would give his approval to
   the cynogamy of Crates, and not rather, repudiating the wild and tumid
   speech of those who resemble him, turn to the investigation of what
   truly deserves attention? Wherefore be not led away by the solemn
   assemblies of philosophers who are no philosophers, who dogmatize one
   against the other, though each one vents but the crude fancies of the
   moment. They have, moreover, many collisions among themselves; each one
   hates the other; they indulge in conflicting opinions, and their
   arrogance makes them eager for the highest places. It would better
   become them, moreover, not to pay court to kings unbidden, nor to
   flatter men at the head of affairs, but to wait till the great ones
   come to them.

      Chapter IV.--The Christians Worship God Alone.

   For what reason, men of Greece, do you wish to bring the civil powers,
   as in a pugilistic encounter, into collision with us? And, if I am not
   disposed to comply with the usages of some of them, why am I to be
   abhorred as a vile miscreant? [426] Does the sovereign order the
   payment of tribute, I am ready to render it. Does my master command me
   to act as a bondsman and to serve, I acknowledge the serfdom. Man is to
   be honoured as a fellow-man; [427] God alone is to be feared,--He who
   is not visible to human eyes, nor comes within the compass of human
   art. Only when I am commanded to deny Him, will I not obey, but will
   rather die than show myself false and ungrateful. Our God did not begin
   to be in time: [428] He alone is without beginning, and He Himself is
   the beginning of all things. God is a Spirit, [429] not pervading
   matter, but the Maker of material spirits, [430] and of the forms that
   are in matter; He is invisible, impalpable, being Himself the Father of
   both sensible and invisible things. Him we know from His creation, and
   apprehend His invisible power by His works. [431] I refuse to adore
   that workmanship which He has made for our sakes. The sun and moon were
   made for us: how, then, can I adore my own servants? How can I speak of
   stocks and stones as gods? For the Spirit that pervades matter [432] is
   inferior to the more divine spirit; and this, even when assimilated to
   the soul, is not to be honoured equally with the perfect God. Nor even
   ought the ineffable God to be presented with gifts; for He who is in
   want of nothing is not to be misrepresented by us as though He were
   indigent. But I will set forth our views more distinctly.

      Chapter V.--The Doctrine of the Christians as to the Creation of the
      World.

   God was in the beginning; but the beginning, we have been taught, is
   the power of the Logos. For the Lord of the universe, who is Himself
   the necessary ground (hupostasis) of all being, inasmuch as no creature
   was yet in existence, was alone; but inasmuch as He was all power,
   Himself the necessary ground of things visible and invisible, with Him
   were all things; with Him, by Logos-power (dia logikes dunameos), the
   Logos Himself also, who was in Him, subsists. [433] And by His simple
   will the Logos springs forth; and the Logos, not coming forth in vain,
   becomes the first-begotten work of the Father. Him (the Logos) we know
   to be the beginning of the world. But He came into being by
   participation, [434] not by abscission; for what is cut off is
   separated from the original substance, but that which comes by
   participation, making its choice of function, [435] does not render him
   deficient from whom it is taken. For just as from one torch many fires
   are lighted, but the light of the first torch is not lessened by the
   kindling of many torches, so the Logos, coming forth from the
   Logos-power of the Father, has not divested of the Logos-power Him who
   begat Him. I myself, for instance, talk, and you hear; yet, certainly,
   I who converse do not become destitute of speech (logos) by the
   transmission of speech, but by the utterance of my voice I endeavour to
   reduce to order the unarranged matter in your minds. And as the Logos,
   [436] begotten in the beginning, begat in turn our world, having first
   created for Himself the necessary matter, so also I, in imitation of
   the Logos, being begotten again, [437] and having become possessed of
   the truth, am trying to reduce to order the confused matter which is
   kindred with myself. For matter is not, like God, without beginning,
   nor, as having no beginning, is of equal power with God; it is
   begotten, and not produced by any other being, but brought into
   existence by the Framer of all things alone.

      Chapter VI.--Christians' Belief in the Resurrection.

   And on this account we believe that there will be a resurrection of
   bodies after the consummation of all things; not, as the Stoics affirm,
   according to the return of certain cycles, the same things being
   produced and destroyed for no useful purpose, but a resurrection once
   for all, [438] when our periods of existence are completed, and in
   consequence solely of the constitution of things under which men alone
   live, for the purpose of passing judgment upon them. Nor is sentence
   upon us passed by Minos or Rhadamanthus, before whose decease not a
   single soul, according to the mythic tales, was judged; but the
   Creator, God Himself, becomes the arbiter. And, although you regard us
   as mere triflers and babblers, it troubles us not, since we have faith
   in this doctrine. For just as, not existing before I was born, I knew
   not who I was, and only existed in the potentiality (upostasis) of
   fleshly matter, but being born, after a former state of nothingness, I
   have obtained through my birth a certainty of my existence; in the same
   way, having been born, and through death existing no longer, and seen
   no longer, I shall exist again, just as before I was not, but was
   afterwards born. Even though fire destroy all traces of my flesh, the
   world receives the vaporized matter; [439] and though dispersed through
   rivers and seas, or torn in pieces by wild beasts, I am laid up in the
   storehouses of a wealthy Lord. And, although the poor and the godless
   know not what is stored up, yet God the Sovereign, when He pleases,
   will restore the substance that is visible to Him alone to its pristine
   condition.

      Chapter VII.--Concerning the Fall of Man.

   For the heavenly Logos, a spirit emanating from the Father and a Logos
   from the Logos-power, in imitation of the Father who begat Him made man
   an image of immortality, so that, as incorruption is with God, in like
   manner, man, sharing in a part of God, might have the immortal
   principle also. The Logos, [440] too, before the creation of men, was
   the Framer of angels. And each of these two orders of creatures was
   made free to act as it pleased, not having the nature of good, which
   again is with God alone, but is brought to perfection in men through
   their freedom of choice, in order that the bad man may be justly
   punished, having become depraved through his own fault, but the just
   man be deservedly praised for his virtuous deeds, since in the exercise
   of his free choice he refrained from transgressing the will of God.
   Such is the constitution of things in reference to angels and men. And
   the power of the Logos, having in itself a faculty to foresee future
   events, not as fated, but as taking place by the choice of free agents,
   foretold from time to time the issues of things to come; it also became
   a forbidder of wickedness by means of prohibitions, and the encomiast
   of those who remained good. And, when men attached themselves to one
   who was more subtle than the rest, having regard to his being the
   first-born, [441] and declared him to be God, though he was resisting
   the law of God, then the power of the Logos excluded the beginner of
   the folly and his adherents from all fellowship with Himself. And so he
   who was made in the likeness of God, since the more powerful spirit is
   separated from him, becomes mortal; but that first-begotten one through
   his transgression and ignorance becomes a demon; and they who imitated
   him, that is his illusions, are become a host of demons, and through
   their freedom of choice have been given up to their own infatuation.

      Chapter VIII.--The Demons Sin Among Mankind.

   But men form the material (hupothesis) of their apostasy. For, having
   shown them a plan of the position of the stars, like dice-players, they
   introduced Fate, a flagrant injustice. For the judge and the judged are
   made so by Fate; the murderers and the murdered, the wealthy and the
   needy, are the offspring of the same Fate; and every nativity is
   regarded as a theatrical entertainment by those beings of whom Homer
   says,--


   "Among the gods

   Rose laughter irrepressible." [442]

   But must not those who are spectators of single combats and are
   partisans on one side or the other, and he who marries and is a
   pæderast and an adulterer, who laughs and is angry, who flees and is
   wounded, be regarded as mortals? For, by whatever actions they manifest
   to men their characters, by these they prompt their hearers to copy
   their example. And are not the demons themselves, with Zeus at their
   head, subjected to Fate, being overpowered by the same passions as men?
   And, besides, how are those beings to be worshipped among whom there
   exists such a great contrariety of opinions? For Rhea, whom the
   inhabitants of the Phrygian mountains call Cybele, enacted emasculation
   on account of Attis, of whom she was enamoured; but Aphrodité is
   delighted with conjugal embraces. Artemis is a poisoner; Apollo heals
   diseases. And after the decapitation of the Gorgon, the beloved of
   Poseidon, whence sprang the horse Pegasus and Chrysaor, Athené and
   Asclepios divided between them the drops of blood; and, while he saved
   men's lives by means of them, she, by the same blood, became a homicide
   and the instigator of wars. From regard to her reputation, as it
   appears to me, the Athenians attributed to the earth the son born of
   her connection with Hephæstos, that Athené might not be thought to be
   deprived of her virility by Hephæstos, as Atalanta by Meleager. This
   limping manufacturer of buckles and earrings, as is likely, deceived
   the motherless child and orphan with these girlish ornaments. Poseidon
   frequents the seas; Ares delights in wars; Apollo is a player on the
   cithara; Dionysus is absolute sovereign of the Thebans; Kronos is a
   tyrannicide; Zeus has intercourse with his own daughter, who becomes
   pregnant by him. I may instance, too, Eleusis, and the mystic Dragon,
   and Orpheus, who says,--


   "Close the gates against the profane!"

   Aïdoneus carries off Koré, and his deeds have been made into mysteries;
   Demeter bewails her daughter, and some persons are deceived by the
   Athenians. In the precincts of the temple of the son of Leto is a spot
   called Omphalos; but Omphalos is the burial-place of Dionysus. You now
   I laud, O Daphne!--by conquering the incontinence of Apollo, you
   disproved his power of vaticination; for, not foreseeing what would
   occur to you, [443] he derived no advantage from his art. Let the
   far-shooting god tell me how Zephyrus slew Hyacinthus. Zephyrus
   conquered him; and in accordance with the saying of the tragic poet,--


   "A breeze is the most honourable chariot of the gods," [444] --

   conquered by a slight breeze, Apollo lost his beloved.

      Chapter IX.--They Give Rise to Superstitions.

   Such are the demons; these are they who laid down the doctrine of Fate.
   Their fundamental principle was the placing of animals in the heavens.
   For the creeping things on the earth, and those that swim in the
   waters, and the quadrupeds on the mountains, with which they lived when
   expelled from heaven,--these they dignified with celestial honour, in
   order that they might themselves be thought to remain in heaven, and,
   by placing the constellations there, might make to appear rational the
   irrational course of life on earth. [445] Thus the high-spirited and he
   who is crushed with toil, the temperate and the intemperate, the
   indigent and the wealthy, are what they are simply from the controllers
   of their nativity. For the delineation of the zodiacal circle is the
   work of gods. And, when the light of one of them predominates, as they
   express it, it deprives all the rest of their honour; and he who now is
   conquered, at another time gains the predominance. And the seven
   planets are well pleased with them, [446] as if they were amusing
   themselves with dice. But we are superior to Fate, and instead of
   wandering (planeton) demons, we have learned to know one Lord who
   wanders not; and, as we do not follow the guidance of Fate, we reject
   its lawgivers. Tell me, I adjure you, [447] did Triptolemus sow wheat
   and prove a benefactor to the Athenians after their sorrow? And why was
   not Demeter, before she lost her daughter, a benefactress to men? The
   Dog of Erigone is shown in the heavens, and the Scorpion the helper of
   Artemis, and Chiron the Centaur, and the divided Argo, and the Bear of
   Callisto. Yet how, before these performed the aforesaid deeds, were the
   heavens unadorned? And to whom will it not appear ridiculous that the
   Deltotum [448] should be placed among the stars, according to some, on
   account of Sicily, or, as others say, on account of the first letter in
   the name of Zeus (Dios)? For why are not Sardinia and Cyprus honoured
   in heaven? And why have not the letters of the names of the brothers of
   Zeus, who shared the kingdom with him, been fixed there too? And how is
   it that Kronos, who was put in chains and ejected from his kingdom, is
   constituted a manager [449] of Fate? How, too, can he give kingdoms who
   no longer reigns himself? Reject, then, these absurdities, and do not
   become transgressors by hating us unjustly.

      Chapter X.--Ridicule of the Heathen Divinities.

   There are legends of the metamorphosis of men: with you the gods also
   are metamorphosed. Rhea becomes a tree; Zeus a dragon, on account of
   Persephone; the sisters of Phaëthon are changed into poplars, and Leto
   into a bird of little value, on whose account what is now Delos was
   called Ortygia. A god, forsooth, becomes a swan, or takes the form of
   an eagle, and, making Ganymede his cupbearer, glories in a vile
   affection. How can I reverence gods who are eager for presents, and
   angry if they do not receive them? Let them have their Fate! I am not
   willing to adore wandering stars. What is that hair of Berenicé? Where
   were her stars before her death? And how was the dead Antinous fixed as
   a beautiful youth in the moon? Who carried him thither: unless
   perchance, as men, perjuring themselves for hire, are credited when
   they say in ridicule of the gods that kings have ascended into heaven,
   so some one, in like manner, has put this man also among the gods,
   [450] and been recompensed with honour and reward? Why have you robbed
   God? Why do you dishonour His workmanship? You sacrifice a sheep, and
   you adore the same animal. The Bull is in the heavens, and you
   slaughter its image. The Kneeler [451] crushes a noxious animal; and
   the eagle that devours the man-maker Prometheus is honoured. The swan
   is noble, forsooth, because it was an adulterer; and the Dioscuri,
   living on alternate days, the ravishers of the daughters of Leucippus,
   are also noble! Better still is Helen, who forsook the flaxen-haired
   Menelaus, and followed the turbaned and gold-adorned Paris. A just man
   also is Sophron, [452] who transported this adulteress to the Elysian
   fields! But even the daughter of Tyndarus is not gifted with
   immortality, and Euripides has wisely represented this woman as put to
   death by Orestes.

      Chapter XI.--The Sin of Men Due Not to Fate, But to Free-Will.

   How, then, shall I admit this nativity according to Fate, when I see
   such managers of Fate? I do not wish to be a king; I am not anxious to
   be rich; I decline military command; I detest fornication; I am not
   impelled by an insatiable love of gain to go to sea; I do not contend
   for chaplets; I am free from a mad thirst for fame; I despise death; I
   am superior to every kind of disease; grief does not consume my soul.
   Am I a slave, I endure servitude. Am I free, I do not make a vaunt of
   my good birth. I see that the same sun is for all, and one death for
   all, whether they live in pleasure or destitution. The rich man sows,
   and the poor man partakes of the same sowing. The wealthiest die, and
   beggars have the same limits to their life. The rich lack many things,
   and are glorious only through the estimation they are held in; [453]
   but the poor man and he who has very moderate desires, seeking as he
   does only the things suited to his lot, more easily obtains his
   purpose. How is it that you are fated to be sleepless through avarice?
   Why are you fated to grasp at things often, and often to die? Die to
   the world, repudiating the madness that is in it. Live to God, and by
   apprehending Him lay aside your old nature. [454] We were not created
   to die, but we die by our own fault. [455] Our free-will has destroyed
   us; we who were free have become slaves; we have been sold through sin.
   Nothing evil has been created by God; we ourselves have manifested
   wickedness; but we, who have manifested it, are able again to reject
   it.

      Chapter XII.--The Two Kinds of Spirits.

   We recognise two varieties of spirit, one of which is called the soul
   [456] (psuche), but the other is greater than the soul, an image and
   likeness of God: both existed in the first men, that in one sense they
   might be material (hulikoi), and in another superior to matter. The
   case stands thus: we can see that the whole structure of the world, and
   the whole creation, has been produced from matter, and the matter
   itself brought into existence [457] by God; so that on the one hand it
   may be regarded as rude and unformed before it was separated into
   parts, and on the other as arranged in beauty and order after the
   separation was made. Therefore in that separation the heavens were made
   of matter, and the stars that are in them; and the earth and all that
   is upon it has a similar constitution: so that there is a common origin
   of all things. But, while such is the case, there yet are certain
   differences in the things made of matter, so that one is more
   beautiful, and another is beautiful but surpassed by something better.
   For as the constitution of the body is under one management, and is
   engaged in doing that which is the cause of its having been made, [458]
   yet though this is the case, there are certain differences of dignity
   in it, and the eye is one thing, and another the ear, and another the
   arrangement of the hair and the distribution of the intestines, and the
   compacting together of the marrow and the bones and the tendons; and
   though one part differs from another, there is yet all the harmony of a
   concert of music in their arrangement;--in like manner the world,
   according to the power of its Maker containing some things of superior
   splendour, but some unlike these, received by the will of the Creator a
   material spirit. And these things severally it is possible for him to
   perceive who does not conceitedly reject those most divine explanations
   which in the course of time have been consigned to writing, and make
   those who study them great lovers of God. Therefore the demons, [459]
   as you call them, having received their structure from matter and
   obtained the spirit which inheres in it, became intemperate and greedy;
   some few, indeed, turning to what was purer, but others choosing what
   was inferior in matter, and conforming their manner of life to it.
   These beings, produced from matter, but very remote from right conduct,
   you, O Greeks, worship. For, being turned by their own folly to
   vaingloriousness, and shaking off the reins [of authority], they have
   been forward to become robbers of Deity; and the Lord of all has
   suffered them to besport themselves, till the world, coming to an end,
   be dissolved, and the Judge appear, and all those men who, while
   assailed by the demons, strive after the knowledge of the perfect God
   obtain as the result of their conflicts a more perfect testimony in the
   day of judgment. There is, then, a spirit in the stars, a spirit in
   angels, a spirit in plants and the waters, a spirit in men, a spirit in
   animals; but, though one and the same, it has differences in itself.
   [460] And while we say these things not from mere hearsay, nor from
   probable conjectures and sophistical reasoning, but using words of a
   certain diviner speech, do you who are willing hasten to learn. And you
   who do not reject with contempt the Scythian Anacharsis, do not disdain
   to be taught by those who follow a barbaric code of laws. Give at least
   as favourable a reception to our tenets as you would to the
   prognostications of the Babylonians. Hearken to us when we speak, if
   only as you would to an oracular oak. And yet the things just referred
   to are the trickeries of frenzied demons, while the doctrines we
   inculcate are far beyond the apprehension of the world.

   [458] Tatian's words are somewhat obscure. We have given substantially
   the opinion of Worth, as expressed in his translation. The sense is:
   The body is evidently a unity in its organization and its activity, and
   the ultimate end which it serves in creation is that with which it is
   occupied, yet there are differences in respect of the parts. Otto
   renders: "For as the constitution of the body is of one plan, and in
   reference to the body the cause of its origin is occupied."

      Chapter XIII.--Theory of the Soul's Immortality.

   The soul is not in itself immortal, O Greeks, but mortal. [461] Yet it
   is possible for it not to die. If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it
   dies, and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the
   end of the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in
   immortality. But, again, if it acquires the knowledge of God, it dies
   not, although for a time it be dissolved. In itself it is darkness, and
   there is nothing luminous in it. And this is the meaning of the saying,
   "The darkness comprehendeth not the light." [462] For the soul does not
   preserve the spirit, but is preserved by it, and the light comprehends
   the darkness. The Logos, in truth, is the light of God, but the
   ignorant soul is darkness. On this account, if it continues solitary,
   it tends downward towards matter, and dies with the flesh; but, if it
   enters into union with the Divine Spirit, it is no longer helpless, but
   ascends to the regions whither the Spirit guides it: for the
   dwelling-place of the spirit is above, but the origin of the soul is
   from beneath. Now, in the beginning the spirit was a constant companion
   of the soul, but the spirit forsook it because it was not willing to
   follow. Yet, retaining as it were a spark of its power, though unable
   by reason of the separation to discern the perfect, while seeking for
   God it fashioned to itself in its wandering many gods, following the
   sophistries of the demons. But the Spirit of God is not with all, but,
   taking up its abode with those who live justly, and intimately
   combining with the soul, by prophecies it announced hidden things to
   other souls. And the souls that are obedient to wisdom have attracted
   to themselves the cognate spirit; [463] but the disobedient, rejecting
   the minister of the suffering God, [464] have shown themselves to be
   fighters against God, rather than His worshippers.

      Chapter XIV.--The Demons Shall Be Punished More Severely Than Men.

   And such are you also, O Greeks,--profuse in words, but with minds
   strangely warped; and you acknowledge the dominion of many rather than
   the rule of one, accustoming yourselves to follow demons as if they
   were mighty. For, as the inhuman robber is wont to overpower those like
   himself by daring; so the demons, going to great lengths in wickedness,
   have utterly deceived the souls among you which are left to themselves
   by ignorance and false appearances. These beings do not indeed die
   easily, for they do not partake of flesh; but while living they
   practice the ways of death, and die themselves as often as they teach
   their followers to sin. Therefore, what is now their chief distinction,
   that they do not die like men, they will retain when about to suffer
   punishment: they will not partake of everlasting life, so as to receive
   this instead of death in a blessed immortality. And as we, to whom it
   now easily happens to die, afterwards receive the immortal with
   enjoyment, or the painful with immortality, so the demons, who abuse
   the present life to purposes of wrong-doing, dying continually even
   while they live, will have hereafter the same immortality, like that
   which they had during the time they lived, but in its nature like that
   of men, who voluntarily performed what the demons prescribed to them
   during their lifetime. And do not fewer kinds of sin break out among
   men owing to the brevity of their lives, [465] while on the part of
   these demons transgression is more abundant owing to their boundless
   existence?

      Chapter XV.--Necessity of a Union with the Holy Spirit.

   But further, it becomes us now to seek for what we once had, but have
   lost, to unite the soul with the Holy Spirit, and to strive after union
   with God. The human soul consists of many parts, and is not simple; it
   is composite, so as to manifest itself through the body; for neither
   could it ever appear by itself without the body, nor does the flesh
   rise again without the soul. Man is not, as the croaking philosophers
   say, merely a rational animal, capable of understanding and knowledge;
   for, according to them, even irrational creatures appear possessed of
   understanding and knowledge. But man alone is the image and likeness of
   God; and I mean by man, not one who performs actions similar to those
   of animals, but one who has advanced far beyond mere humanity--to God
   Himself. This question we have discussed more minutely in the treatise
   concerning animals. But the principal point to be spoken of now is,
   what is intended by the image and likeness of God. That which cannot be
   compared is no other than abstract being; but that which is compared is
   no other than that which is like. The perfect God is without flesh; but
   man is flesh. The bond of the flesh is the soul; [466] that which
   encloses the soul is the flesh. Such is the nature of man's
   constitution; and, if it be like a temple, God is pleased to dwell in
   it by the spirit, His representative; but, if it be not such a
   habitation, man excels the wild beasts in articulate language only,--in
   other respects his manner of life is like theirs, as one who is not a
   likeness of God. But none of the demons possess flesh; their structure
   is spiritual, like that of fire or air. And only by those whom the
   Spirit of God dwells in and fortifies are the bodies of the demons
   easily seen, not at all by others,--I mean those who possess only soul;
   [467] for the inferior has not the ability to apprehend the superior.
   On this account the nature of the demons has no place for repentance;
   for they are the reflection of matter and of wickedness. But matter
   desired to exercise lordship over the soul; and according to their
   free-will these gave laws of death to men; but men, after the loss of
   immortality, have conquered death by submitting to death in faith;
   [468] and by repentance a call has been given to them, according to the
   word which says, "Since they were made a little lower than the angels."
   [469] And, for every one who has been conquered, it is possible again
   to conquer, if he rejects the condition which brings death. And what
   that is, may be easily seen by men who long for immortality.

      Chapter XVI.--Vain Display of Power by the Demons.

   But the demons [470] who rule over men are not the souls of men; for
   how should these be capable of action after death? unless man, who
   while living was void of understanding and power, should be believed
   when dead to be endowed with more of active power. But neither could
   this be the case, as we have shown elsewhere. [471] And it is difficult
   to conceive that the immortal soul, which is impeded by the members of
   the body, should become more intelligent when it has migrated from it.
   For the demons, inspired with frenzy against men by reason of their own
   wickedness, pervert their minds, which already incline downwards, by
   various deceptive scenic representations, that they may be disabled
   from rising to the path that leads to heaven. But from us the things
   which are in the world are not hidden, and the divine is easily
   apprehended by us if the power that makes souls immortal visits us. The
   demons are seen also by the men possessed of soul, when, as sometimes,
   they exhibit themselves to men, either that they may be thought to be
   something, or as evil-disposed friends may do harm to them as to
   enemies, or afford occasions of doing them honour to those who resemble
   them. For, if it were possible, they would without doubt pull down
   heaven itself with the rest of creation. But now this they can by no
   means effect, for they have not the power; but they make war by means
   of the lower matter against the matter that is like themselves. Should
   any one wish to conquer them, let him repudiate matter. Being armed
   with the breastplate [472] of the celestial Spirit, he will be able to
   preserve all that is encompassed by it. There are, indeed, diseases and
   disturbances of the matter that is in us; but, when such things happen,
   the demons ascribe the causes of them to themselves, and approach a man
   whenever disease lays hold of him. Sometimes they themselves disturb
   the habit of the body by a tempest of folly; but, being smitten by the
   word of God, they depart in terror, and the sick man is healed.

      Chapter XVII.--They Falsely Promise Health to Their Votaries.

   Concerning the sympathies and antipathies of Democritus what can we say
   but this, that, according to the common saying, the man of Abdera is
   Abderiloquent? But, as he who gave the name to the city, a friend of
   Hercules as it is said, was devoured by the horses of Diomedes, so he
   who boasted of the Magian Ostanes [473] will be delivered up in the day
   of consummation [474] as fuel for the eternal fire. And you, if you do
   not cease from your laughter, will gain the same punishment as the
   jugglers. Wherefore, O Greeks, hearken to me, addressing you as from an
   eminence, nor in mockery transfer your own want of reason to the herald
   of the truth. A diseased affection (pathos) is not destroyed by a
   counter-affection (antipatheia), nor is a maniac cured by hanging
   little amulets of leather upon him. There are visitations of demons;
   and he who is sick, and he who says he is in love, and he who hates,
   and he who wishes to be revenged, accept them as helpers. And this is
   the method of their operation: just as the forms of alphabetic letters
   and the lines composed of them cannot of themselves indicate what is
   meant, but men have invented for themselves signs of their thoughts,
   knowing by their peculiar combination what the order of the letters was
   intended to express; so, in like manner, the various kinds of roots and
   the mutual relation of the sinews and bones can effect nothing of
   themselves, but are the elemental matter with which the depravity of
   the demons works, who have determined for what purpose each of them is
   available. And, when they see that men consent to be served by means of
   such things, they take them and make them their slaves. But how can it
   be honourable to minister to adulteries? How can it be noble to
   stimulate men in hating one another? Or how is it becoming to ascribe
   to matter the relief of the insane, and not to God? For by their art
   they turn men aside from the pious acknowledgment of God, leading them
   to place confidence in herbs and roots. [475] But God, if He had
   prepared these things to effect just what men wish, would be a Producer
   of evil things; whereas He Himself produced everything which has good
   qualities, but the profligacy of the demons has made use of the
   productions of nature for evil purposes, and the appearance of evil
   which these wear is from them, and not from the perfect God. For how
   comes it to pass that when alive I was in no wise evil, but that now I
   am dead and can do nothing, my remains, which are incapable of motion
   or even sense, should effect something cognizable by the senses? And
   how shall he who has died by the most miserable death be able to assist
   in avenging any one? If this were possible, much more might he defend
   himself from his own enemy; being able to assist others, much more
   might he constitute himself his own avenger.

      Chapter XVIII.--They Deceive, Instead of Healing.

   But medicine and everything included in it is an invention of the same
   kind. If any one is healed by matter, through trusting to it, much more
   will he be healed by having recourse to the power of God. As noxious
   preparations are material compounds, so are curatives of the same
   nature. If, however, we reject the baser matter, some persons often
   endeavour to heal by a union of one of these bad things with some
   other, and will make use of the bad to attain the good. But, just as he
   who dines with a robber, though he may not be a robber himself,
   partakes of the punishment on account of his intimacy with him, so he
   who is not bad but associates with the bad, having dealings with them
   for some supposed good, will be punished by God the Judge for
   partnership in the same object. Why is he who trusts in the system of
   matter [476] not willing to trust in God? For what reason do you not
   approach the more powerful Lord, but rather seek to cure yourself, like
   the dog with grass, or the stag with a viper, or the hog with
   river-crabs, or the lion with apes? Why you deify the objects of
   nature? And why, when you cure your neighbour, are you called a
   benefactor? Yield to the power of the Logos! The demons do not cure,
   but by their art make men their captives. And the most admirable Justin
   [477] has rightly denounced them as robbers. For, as it is the practice
   of some to capture persons and then to restore them to their friends
   for a ransom, so those who are esteemed gods, invading the bodies of
   certain persons, and producing a sense of their presence by dreams,
   command them to come forth into public, and in the sight of all, when
   they have taken their fill of the things of this world, fly away from
   the sick, and, destroying the disease which they had produced, restore
   men to their former state.

      Chapter XIX.--Depravity Lies at the Bottom of Demon-Worship.

   But do you, who have not the perception of these things, be instructed
   by us who know them: though you do profess to despise death, and to be
   sufficient of yourselves for everything. But this is a discipline in
   which your philosophers are so greatly deficient, that some of them
   receive from the king of the Romans 600 aurei yearly, for no useful
   service they perform, but that they may not even wear a long beard
   without being paid for it! Crescens, who made his nest in the great
   city, surpassed all men in unnatural love (paiderastia), and was
   strongly addicted to the love of money. Yet this man, who professed to
   despise death, was so afraid of death, that he endeavoured to inflict
   on Justin, and indeed on me, the punishment of death, as being an evil,
   because by proclaiming the truth he convicted the philosophers of being
   gluttons and cheats. But whom of the philosophers, save you only, was
   he accustomed to inveigh against? If you say, in agreement with our
   tenets, that death is not to be dreaded, do not court death from an
   insane love of fame among men, like Anaxagoras, but become despisers of
   death by reason of the knowledge of God. The construction of the world
   is excellent, but the life men live in it is bad; and we may see those
   greeted with applause as in a solemn assembly who know not God. For
   what is divination? and why are ye deceived by it? It is a minister to
   thee of worldly lusts. You wish to make war, and you take Apollo as a
   counsellor of slaughter. You want to carry off a maiden by force, and
   you select a divinity to be your accomplice. You are ill by your own
   fault; and, as Agamemnon [478] wished for ten councillors, so you wish
   to have gods with you. Some woman by drinking water gets into a frenzy,
   and loses her senses by the fumes of frankincense, and you say that she
   has the gift of prophecy. Apollo was a prognosticator and a teacher of
   soothsayers: in the matter of Daphne he deceived himself. An oak,
   forsooth, is oracular, and birds utter presages! And so you are
   inferior to animals and plants! It would surely be a fine thing for you
   to become a divining rod, or to assume the wings of a bird! He who
   makes you fond of money also foretells your getting rich; he who
   excites to seditions and wars also predicts victory in war. If you are
   superior to the passions, you will despise all worldly things. Do not
   abhor us who have made this attainment, but, repudiating the demons,
   [479] follow the one God. "All things [480] were made by Him, and
   without Him not one thing was made." If there is poison in natural
   productions, this has supervened through our sinfulness. I am able to
   show the perfect truth of these things; only do you hearken, and he who
   believes will understand.

      Chapter XX.--Thanks are Ever Due to God.

   Even if you be healed by drugs (I grant you that point by courtesy),
   yet it behoves you to give testimony of the cure to God. For the world
   still draws us down, and through weakness I incline towards matter. For
   the wings of the soul were the perfect spirit, but, having cast this
   off through sin, it flutters like a nestling and falls to the ground.
   Having left the heavenly companionship, it hankers after communion with
   inferior things. The demons were driven forth to another abode; the
   first created human beings were expelled from their place: the one,
   indeed, were cast down from heaven; but the other were driven from
   earth, yet not out of this earth, but from a more excellent order of
   things than exists here now. And now it behoves us, yearning after that
   pristine state, to put aside everything that proves a hindrance. The
   heavens are not infinite, O man, but finite and bounded; and beyond
   them are the superior worlds which have not a change of seasons, by
   which various diseases are produced, but, partaking of every happy
   temperature, have perpetual day, and light unapproachable by men below.
   [481] Those who have composed elaborate descriptions of the earth have
   given an account of its various regions so far as this was possible to
   man; but, being unable to speak of that which is beyond, because of the
   impossibility of personal observation, they have assigned as the cause
   the existence of tides; and that one sea is filled with weed, and
   another with mud; and that some localities are burnt up with heat, and
   others cold and frozen. We, however, have learned things which were
   unknown to us, through the teaching of the prophets, who, being fully
   persuaded that the heavenly spirit [482] along with the soul will
   acquire a clothing of mortality, foretold things which other minds were
   unacquainted with. But it is possible for every one who is naked to
   obtain this apparel, and to return to its ancient kindred.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [481] [The flavour of this passage comes out with more sweetness in
   Kaye's note (p. 198, Justin M.), thus: "Above the visible heavens exist
   the better ages, aiones oi kreittones, having no change of seasons from
   which various diseases take their orgin; but, blest with a uniform
   goodness of temperature, they enjoy perpetual day, and light
   inaccessible to men who dwell here below." Here Tatian seems to me to
   have had in mind a noble passage from Pindar, one of the most exquisite
   specimens of Greek poetry, which he baptizes and sanctifies.

      Chapter XXI.--Doctrines of the Christians and Greeks Respecting God
      Compared.

   We do not act as fools, O Greeks, nor utter idle tales, when we
   announce that God was born in the form of a man. I call on you who
   reproach us to compare your mythical accounts with our narrations.
   Athené, as they say, took the form of Deïphobus for the sake of Hector,
   [483] and the unshorn Phooebus for the sake of Admetus fed the
   trailing-footed oxen, and the spouse us came as an old woman to Semele.
   But, while you treat seriously such things, how can you deride us? Your
   Asclepios died, and he who ravished fifty virgins in one night at
   Thespiæ lost his life by delivering himself to the devouring flame.
   Prometheus, fastened to Caucasus, suffered punishment for his good
   deeds to men. According to you, Zeus is envious, and hides the dream
   [484] from men, wishing their destruction. Wherefore, looking at your
   own memorials, vouchsafe us your approval, though it were only as
   dealing in legends similar to your own. We, however, do not deal in
   folly, but your legends are only idle tales. If you speak of the origin
   of the gods, you also declare them to be mortal. For what reason is
   Hera now never pregnant? Has she grown old? or is there no one to give
   you information? Believe me now, O Greeks, and do not resolve your
   myths and gods into allegory. If you attempt to do this, the divine
   nature as held by you is overthrown by your own selves; for, if the
   demons with you are such as they are said to be, they are worthless as
   to character; or, if regarded as symbols of the powers of nature, they
   are not what they are called. But I cannot be persuaded to pay
   religious homage to the natural elements, nor can I undertake to
   persuade my neighbour. And Metrodorus of Lampsacus, in his treatise
   concerning Homer, has argued very foolishly, turning everything into
   allegory. For he says that neither Hera, nor Athené, nor Zeus are what
   those persons suppose who consecrate to them sacred enclosures and
   groves, but parts of nature and certain arrangements of the elements.
   Hector also, and Achilles, and Agamemnon, and all the Greeks in
   general, and the Barbarians with Helen and Paris, being of the same
   nature, you will of course say are introduced merely for the sake of
   the machinery [485] of the poem, not one of these personages having
   really existed. But these things we have put forth only for argument's
   sake; for it is not allowable even to compare our notion of God with
   those who are wallowing in matter and mud.

   And of what sort are your teachings? Who must not treat with contempt
   your solemn festivals, which, being held in honour of wicked demons,
   cover men with infamy? I have often seen a man [486] --and have been
   amazed to see, and the amazement has ended in contempt, to think how he
   is one thing internally, but outwardly counterfeits what he is
   not--giving himself excessive airs of daintiness and indulging in all
   sorts of effeminacy; sometimes darting his eyes about; sometimes
   throwing his hands hither and thither, and raving with his face smeared
   with mud; sometimes personating Aphrodité, sometimes Apollo; a solitary
   accuser of all the gods, an epitome of superstition, a vituperator of
   heroic deeds, an actor of murders, a chronicler of adultery, a
   storehouse of madness, a teacher of cynædi, an instigator of capital
   sentences;--and yet such a man is praised by all. But I have rejected
   all his falsehoods, his impiety, his practices,--in short, the man
   altogether. But you are led captive by such men, while you revile those
   who do not take a part in your pursuits. I have no mind to stand agape
   at a number of singers, nor do I desire to be affected in sympathy with
   a man when he is winking and gesticulating in an unnatural manner. What
   wonderful or extraordinary thing is performed among you? They utter
   ribaldry in affected tones, and go through indecent movements; your
   daughters and your sons behold them giving lessons in adultery on the
   stage. Admirable places, forsooth, are your lecture-rooms, where every
   base action perpetrated by night is proclaimed aloud, and the hearers
   are regaled with the utterance of infamous discourses! Admirable, too,
   are your mendacious poets, who by their fictions beguile their hearers
   from the truth!

      Chapter XXIII.--Of the Pugilists and Gladiators.

   I have seen men weighed down by bodily exercise, and carrying about the
   burden of their flesh, before whom rewards and chaplets are set, while
   the adjudicators cheer them on, not to deeds of virtue, but to rivalry
   in violence and discord; and he who excels in giving blows is crowned.
   These are the lesser evils; as for the greater, who would not shrink
   from telling them? Some, giving themselves up to idleness for the sake
   of profligacy, sell themselves to be killed; and the indigent barters
   himself away, while the rich man buys others to kill him. And for these
   the witnesses take their seats, and the boxers meet in single combat,
   for no reason whatever, nor does any one come down into the arena to
   succour. Do such exhibitions as these redound to your credit? He who is
   chief among you collects a legion of blood-stained murderers, engaging
   to maintain them; and these ruffians are sent forth by him, and you
   assemble at the spectacle to be judges, partly of the wickedness of the
   adjudicator, and partly of that of the men who engage in the combat.
   And he who misses the murderous exhibition is grieved, because he was
   not doomed to be a spectator of wicked and impious and abominable
   deeds. You slaughter animals for the purpose of eating their flesh, and
   you purchase men to supply a cannibal banquet for the soul, nourishing
   it by the most impious bloodshedding. The robber commits murder for the
   sake of plunder, but the rich man purchases gladiators for the sake of
   their being killed. [487]

   Acusilaus, and Menander, a versifier of the same class! And why should
   I admire the mythic piper? Why should I busy myself about the Theban
   Antigenides, [488] like Aristoxenus? We leave you to these worthless
   things; and do you either believe our doctrines, or, like us, give up

      Chapter XXV.--Boastings and Quarrels of the Philosophers.

   What great and wonderful things have your philosophers effected? They
   leave uncovered one of their shoulders; they let their hair grow long;
   they cultivate their beards; their nails are like the claws of wild
   beasts. Though they say that they want nothing, yet, like Proteus,
   [489] they need a currier for their wallet, and a weaver for their
   mantle, and a wood-cutter for their staff, and the rich, [490] and a
   cook also for their gluttony. O man competing with the dog, [491] you
   know not God, and so have turned to the imitation of an irrational
   animal. You cry out in public with an assumption of authority, and take
   upon you to avenge your own self; and if you receive nothing, you
   indulge in abuse, and philosophy is with you the art of getting money.
   You follow the doctrines of Plato, and a disciple of Epicurus lifts up
   his voice to oppose you. Again, you wish to be a disciple of Aristotle,
   and a follower of Democritus rails at you. Pythagoras says that he was
   Euphorbus, and he is the heir of the doctrine of Pherecydes; but
   Aristotle impugns the immortality of the soul. You who receive from
   your predecessors doctrines which clash with one another, you the
   inharmonious, are fighting against the harmonious. One of you asserts
   that God is body, but I assert that He is without body; that the world
   is indestructible, but I say that it is to be destroyed; that a
   conflagration will take place at various times, but I say that it will
   come to pass once for all; that Minos and Rhadamanthus are judges, but
   I say that God Himself is Judge; that the soul alone is endowed with
   immortality, but I say that the flesh also is endowed with it. [492]
   What injury do we inflict upon you, O Greeks? Why do you hate those who
   follow the word of God, as if they were the vilest of mankind? It is
   not we who eat human flesh [493] --they among you who assert such a
   thing have been suborned as false witnesses; it is among you that
   Pelops is made a supper for the gods, although beloved by Poseidon, and
   Kronos devours his children, and Zeus swallows Metis.

      Chapter XXVI.--Ridicule of the Studies of the Greeks.

   Cease to make a parade of sayings which you have derived from others,
   and to deck yourselves like the daw in borrowed plumes. If each state
   were to take away its contribution to your speech, your fallacies would
   lose their power. While inquiring what God is, you are ignorant of what
   is in yourselves; and, while staring all agape at the sky, you stumble
   into pitfalls. The reading of your books is like walking through a
   labyrinth, and their readers resemble the cask of the Danaïds. Why do
   you divide time, saying that one part is past, and another present, and
   another future? For how can the future be passing when the present
   exists? As those who are sailing imagine in their ignorance, as the
   ship is borne along, that the hills are in motion, so you do not know
   that it is you who are passing along, but that time (ho aion) remains
   present as long as the Creator wills it to exist. Why am I called to
   account for uttering my opinions, and why are you in such haste to put
   them all down? Were not you born in the same manner as ourselves, and
   placed under the same government of the world? Why say that wisdom is
   with you alone, who have not another sun, nor other risings of the
   stars, nor a more distinguished origin, nor a death preferable to that
   of other men? The grammarians have been the beginning of this idle
   talk; and you who parcel out wisdom are cut off from the wisdom that is
   according to truth, and assign the names of the several parts to
   particular men; and you know not God, but in your fierce contentions
   destroy one another. And on this account you are all nothing worth.
   While you arrogate to yourselves the sole right of discussion, you
   discourse like the blind man with the deaf. Why do you handle the
   builder's tools without knowing how to build? Why do you busy
   yourselves with words, while you keep aloof from deeds, puffed up with
   praise, but cast down by misfortunes? Your modes of acting are contrary
   to reason, for you make a pompous appearance in public, but hide your
   teaching in corners. Finding you to be such men as these, we have
   abandoned you, and no longer concern ourselves with your tenets, but
   follow the word of God. Why, O man, do you set the letters of the
   alphabet at war with one another? Why do you, as in a boxing match,
   make their sounds clash together with your mincing Attic way of
   speaking, whereas you ought to speak more according to nature? For if
   you adopt the Attic dialect though not an Athenian, pray why do you not
   speak like the Dorians? How is it that one appears to you more rugged,
   the other more pleasant for intercourse?

      Chapter XXVII.--The Christians are Hated Unjustly.

   And if you adhere to their teaching, why do you fight against me for
   choosing such views of doctrine as I approve? Is it not unreasonable
   that, while the robber is not to be punished for the name he bears,
   [494] but only when the truth about him has been clearly ascertained,
   yet we are to be assailed with abuse on a judgment formed without
   examination? Diagoras was an Athenian, but you punished him for
   divulging the Athenian mysteries; yet you who read his Phrygian
   discourses hate us. You possess the commentaries of Leo, and are
   displeased with our refutations of them; and having in your hands the
   opinions of Apion concerning the Egyptian gods, you denounce us as most
   impious. The tomb of Olympian Zeus is shown among you, [495] though
   some one says that the Cretans are liars. [496] Your assembly of many
   gods is nothing. Though their despiser Epicurus acts as a torch-bearer,
   [497] I do not any the more conceal from the rulers that view of God
   which I hold in relation to His government of the universe. Why do you
   advise me to be false to my principles? Why do you who say that you
   despise death exhort us to use art in order to escape it? I have not
   the heart of a deer; but your zeal for dialectics resembles the
   loquacity of Thersites. How can I believe one who tells me that the sun
   is a red-hot mass and the moon an earth? Such assertions are mere
   logomachies, and not a sober exposition of truth. How can it be
   otherwise than foolish to credit the books of Herodotus relating to the
   history of Hercules, which tell of an upper earth from which the lion
   came down that was killed by Hercules? And what avails the Attic style,
   the sorites of philosophers, the plausibilities of syllogisms, the
   measurements of the earth, the positions of the stars, and the course
   of the sun? To be occupied in such inquiries is the work of one who
   imposes opinions on himself as if they were laws.

   On this account I reject your legislation also; for there ought to be

   there are states, so that things held disgraceful in some are
   honourable in others. The Greeks consider intercourse with a mother as

   Wherefore, having seen these things, and moreover also having been
   admitted to the mysteries, and having everywhere examined the religious
   rites performed by the effeminate and the pathic, and having found
   among the Romans their Latiarian Jupiter delighting in human gore and
   the blood of slaughtered men, and Artemis not far from the great city
   [498] sanctioning acts of the same kind, and one demon here and another
   there instigating to the perpetration of evil,--retiring by myself, I
   sought how I might be able to discover the truth. And, while I was
   giving my most earnest attention to the matter, I happened to meet with
   certain barbaric writings, too old to be compared with the opinions of
   the Greeks, and too divine to be compared with their errors; and I was
   led to put faith in these by the unpretending cast of the language, the
   inartificial character of the writers, the foreknowledge displayed of
   future events, the excellent quality of the precepts, and the
   declaration of the government of the universe as centred in one Being.
   [499] And, my soul being taught of God, I discern that the former class
   of writings lead to condemnation, but that these put an end to the
   slavery that is in the world, and rescue us from a multiplicity of
   rulers and ten thousand tyrants, while they give us, not indeed what we
   had not before received, but what we had received but were prevented by
   error from retaining.

      Chapter XXX.--How He Resolved to Resist the Devil.

   Therefore, being initiated and instructed in these things, I wish to
   put away my former errors as the follies of childhood. For we know that
   the nature of wickedness is like that of the smallest seeds; since it
   has waxed strong from a small beginning, but will again be destroyed if
   we obey the words of God and do not scatter ourselves. For He has
   become master of all we have by means of a certain "hidden treasure,"
   [500] which while we are digging for we are indeed covered with dust,
   but we secure it as our fixed possession. He who receives the whole of
   this treasure has obtained command of the most precious wealth. Let
   these things, then, be said to our friends. But to you Greeks what can
   I say, except to request you not to rail at those who are better than
   yourselves, nor if they are called Barbarians to make that an occasion
   of banter? For, if you are willing, you will be able to find out the
   cause of men's not being able to understand one another's language; for
   to those who wish to examine our principles I will give a simple and
   copious account of them.

      Chapter XXXI.--The Philosophy of the Christians More Ancient Than that of
      the Greeks.

   But now it seems proper for me to demonstrate that our philosophy is
   older than the systems of the Greeks. Moses and Homer shall be our
   limits, each of them being of great antiquity; the one being the oldest
   of poets and historians, and the other the founder of all barbarian
   wisdom. Let us, then, institute a comparison between them; and we shall
   find that our doctrines are older, not only than those of the Greeks,
   but than the invention of letters. [501] And I will not bring forward
   witnesses from among ourselves, but rather have recourse to Greeks. To
   do the former would be foolish, because it would not be allowed by you;
   but the other will surprise you, when, by contending against you with
   your own weapons, I adduce arguments of which you had no suspicion. Now
   the poetry of Homer, his parentage, and the time in which he flourished
   have been investigated by the most ancient writers,--by Theagenes of
   Rhegium, who lived in the time of Cambyses, Stesimbrotus of Thasos and
   Antimachus of Colophon, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, and Dionysius the
   Olynthian; after them, by Ephorus of Cumæ, and Philochorus the
   Athenian, Megaclides and Chamæleon the Peripatetics; afterwards by the
   grammarians, Zenodotus, Aristophanes, Callimachus, Crates,
   Eratosthenes, Aristarchus, and Apollodorus. Of these, Crates says that
   he flourished before the return of the Heraclidæ, and within 80 years
   after the Trojan war; Eratosthenes says that it was after the 100th
   year from the taking of Ilium; Aristarchus, that it was about the time
   of the Ionian migration, which was 140 years after that event; but,
   according to Philochorus, after the Ionian migration, in the archonship
   of Archippus at Athens, 180 years after the Trojan war; Apollodorus
   says it was 100 years after the Ionian migration, which would be 240
   years after the Trojan war. Some say that he lived 90 years before the
   Olympiads, which would be 317 years after the taking of Troy. Others
   carry it down to a later date, and say that Homer was a contemporary of
   Archilochus; but Archilochus flourished about the 23d Olympiad, in the
   time of Gyges the Lydian, 500 years after Troy. Thus, concerning the
   age of the aforesaid poet, I mean Homer, and the discrepancies of those
   who have spoken of him, we have said enough in a summary manner for
   those who are able to investigate with accuracy. For it is possible to
   show that the opinions held about the facts themselves also are false.
   For, where the assigned dates do not agree together, it is impossible
   that the history should be true. For what is the cause of error in
   writing, but the narrating of things that are not true?

      Chapter XXXII.--The Doctrine of the Christians, is Opposed to Dissensions,
      and Fitted for All.

   But with us there is no desire of vainglory, nor do we indulge in a
   variety of opinions. For having renounced the popular and earthly, and
   obeying the commands of God, and following the law of the Father of
   immortality, we reject everything which rests upon human opinion. Not
   only do the rich among us pursue our philosophy, but the poor enjoy
   instruction gratuitously; [502] for the things which come from God
   surpass the requital of worldly gifts. Thus we admit all who desire to
   hear, even old women and striplings; and, in short, persons of every
   age are treated by us with respect, but every kind of licentiousness is
   kept at a distance. And in speaking we do not utter falsehood. It would
   be an excellent thing if your continuance in unbelief should receive a
   check; but, however that may be, let our cause remain confirmed by the
   judgment pronounced by God. Laugh, if you please; but you will have to
   weep hereafter. Is it not absurd that Nestor, [503] who was slow at
   cutting his horses' reins owing to his weak and sluggish old age, is,
   according to you, to be admired for attempting to rival the young men
   in fighting, while you deride those among us who struggle against old
   age and occupy themselves with the things pertaining to God? Who would
   not laugh when you tell us that the Amazons, and Semiramis, and certain
   other warlike women existed, while you cast reproaches on our maidens?
   Achilles was a youth, yet is believed to have been very magnanimous;
   and Neoptolemus was younger, but strong; Philoctetes was weak, but the
   divinity had need of him against Troy. What sort of man was Thersites?
   yet he held a command in the army, and, if he had not through
   doltishness had such an unbridled tongue, he would not have been
   reproached for being peak-headed and bald. As for those who wish to
   learn our philosophy, we do not test them by their looks, nor do we
   judge of those who come to us by their outward appearance; for we argue
   that there may be strength of mind in all, though they may be weak in
   body. But your proceedings are full of envy and abundant stupidity.

      Chapter XXXIII.--Vindication of Christian Women.

   Therefore I have been desirous to prove from the things which are
   esteemed honourable among you, that our institutions are marked by
   sober-mindedness, but that yours are in close affinity with madness.
   [504] You who say that we talk nonsense among women and boys, among
   maidens and old women, and scoff at us for not being with you, hear
   what silliness prevails among the Greeks. For their works of art are
   devoted to worthless objects, while they are held in higher estimation
   by you than even your gods; and you behave yourselves unbecomingly in
   what relates to woman. For Lysippus cast a statue of Praxilla, whose
   poems contain nothing useful, and Menestratus one of Learchis, and
   Selanion one of Sappho the courtezan, and Naucydes one of Erinna the
   Lesbian, and Boiscus one of Myrtis, and Cephisodotus one of Myro of
   Byzantium, and Gomphus one of Praxigoris, and Amphistratus one of
   Clito. And what shall I say about Anyta, Telesilla, and Mystis? Of the
   first Euthycrates and Cephisodotus made a statue, and of the second
   Niceratus, and of the third Aristodotus; Euthycrates made one of
   Mnesiarchis the Ephesian, Selanion one of Corinna, and Euthycrates one
   of Thalarchis the Argive. My object in referring to these women is,
   that you may not regard as something strange what you find among us,
   and that, comparing the statues which are before your eyes, you may not
   treat the women with scorn who among us pursue philosophy. This Sappho
   is a lewd, love-sick female, and sings her own wantonness; [505] but
   all our women are chaste, and the maidens at their distaffs sing of
   divine things [506] more nobly than that damsel of yours. Wherefore be
   ashamed, you who are professed disciples of women yet scoff at those of
   the sex who hold our doctrine, as well as at the solemn assemblies they
   frequent. [507] What a noble infant did Glaucippé present to you, who
   brought forth a prodigy, as is shown by her statue cast by Niceratus,
   the son of Euctemon the Athenian! But, if Glaucippé brought forth an
   elephant, was that a reason why she should enjoy public honours?
   Praxiteles and Herodotus made for you Phryné the courtezan, and
   Euthycrates cast a brazen statue of Panteuchis, who was pregnant by a
   whoremonger; and Dinomenes, because Besantis queen of the Pæonians gave
   birth to a black infant, took pains to preserve her memory by his art.
   I condemn Pythagoras too, who made a figure of Europa on the bull; and
   you also, who honour the accuser of Zeus on account of his artistic
   skill. And I ridicule the skill of Myron, who made a heifer and upon it
   a Victory because by carrying off the daughter of Agenor it had borne
   away the prize for adultery and lewdness. The Olynthian Herodotus made
   statues of Glycera the courtezan and Argeia the harper. Bryaxis made a
   statue of Pasiphaë; and, by having a memorial of her lewdness, it seems
   to have been almost your desire that the women of the present time
   should be like her. [508] A certain Melanippë was a wise woman, and for
   that reason Lysistratus made her statue. But, forsooth, you will not
   believe that among us there are wise women!

      Chapter XXXIV.--Ridicule of the Statues Erected by the Greeks.

   Worthy of very great honour, certainly, was the tyrant Bhalaris, who
   devoured sucklings, and accordingly is exhibited by the workmanship of
   Polystratus the Ambraciot, even to this day, as a very wonderful man!
   The Agrigentines dreaded to look on that countenance of his, because of
   his cannibalism; but people of culture now make it their boast that
   they behold him in his statue! Is it not shameful that fratricide is
   honoured by you who look on the statues of Polynices and Eteocles, and
   that you have not rather buried them with their maker Pythagoras?
   Destroy these memorials of iniquity! Why should I contemplate with
   admiration the figure of the woman who bore thirty children, merely for
   the sake of the artist Periclymenus? One ought to turn away with
   disgust from one who bore off the fruits of great incontinence, and
   whom the Romans compared to a sow, which also on a like account, they
   say, was deemed worthy of a mystic worship. Ares committed adultery
   with Aphrodité, and Andron made an image of their offspring Harmonia.
   Sophron, who committed to writing trifles and absurdities, was more
   celebrated for his skill in casting metals, of which specimens exist
   even now. And not only have his tales kept the fabulist Æsop in
   everlasting remembrance, but also the plastic art of Aristodemus has
   increased his celebrity. How is it then that you, who have so many
   poetesses whose productions are mere trash, and innumerable courtezans,
   and worthless men, are not ashamed to slander the reputation of our
   women? What care I to know that Euanthé gave birth to an infant in the
   Peripatus, or to gape with wonder at the art of Callistratus, or to fix
   my gaze on the Neæra of Calliades? For she was a courtezan. Laïs was a
   prostitute, and Turnus made her a monument of prostitution. Why are you
   not ashamed of the fornication of Hephæstion, even though Philo has
   represented him very artistically? And for what reason do you honour
   the hermaphrodite Ganymede by Leochares, as if you possessed something
   admirable? Praxiteles even made a statue of a woman with the stain of
   impurity upon it. It behoved you, repudiating everything of this kind,
   to seek what is truly worthy of attention, and not to turn with disgust
   from our mode of life while receiving with approval the shameful
   productions of Philænis and Elephantis.

      Chapter XXXV.--Tatian Speaks as an Eye-Witness.

   The things which I have thus set before you I have not learned at
   second hand. I have visited many lands; I have followed rhetoric, like
   yourselves; I have fallen in with many arts and inventions; and
   finally, when sojourning in the city of the Romans, I inspected the
   multiplicity of statues brought thither by you: for I do not attempt,
   as is the custom with many, to strengthen my own views by the opinions
   of others, but I wish to give you a distinct account of what I myself
   have seen and felt. So, bidding farewell to the arrogance of Romans and
   the idle talk of Athenians, and all their ill-connected opinions, I
   embraced our barbaric philosophy. I began to show how this was more
   ancient than your institutions, [509] but left my task unfinished, in
   order to discuss a matter which demanded more immediate attention; but
   now it is time I should attempt to speak concerning its doctrines. Be
   not offended with our teaching, nor undertake an elaborate reply filled
   with trifling and ribaldry, saying, "Tatian, aspiring to be above the
   Greeks, above the infinite number of philosophic inquirers, has struck
   out a new path, and embraced the doctrines of Barbarians." For what
   grievance is it, that men manifestly ignorant should be reasoned with
   by a man of like nature with themselves? Or how can it be irrational,
   according to your own sophist, [510] to grow old always learning
   something?

      Chapter XXXVI.--Testimony of the Chaldeans to the Antiquity of Moses.

   But let Homer be not later than the Trojan war; let it be granted that
   he was contemporary with it, or even that he was in the army of
   Agamemnon, and, if any so please, that he lived before the invention of
   letters. The Moses before mentioned will be shown to have been many
   years older than the taking of Troy, and far more ancient than the
   building of Troy, or than Tros and Dardanus. To demonstrate this I will
   call in as witnesses the Chaldeans, the Phoenicians and the Egyptians.
   And what more need I say? For it behoves one who professes to persuade
   his hearers to make his narrative of events very concise. Berosus, a
   Babylonian, a priest of their god Belus, born in the time of Alexander,
   composed for Antiochus, the third after him, the history of the
   Chaldeans in three books; and, narrating the acts of the kings, he
   mentions one of them, Nabuchodonosor by name, who made war against the
   Phoenicians and the Jews,--events which we know were announced by our
   prophets, and which happened much later than the age of Moses, seventy
   years before the Persian empire. But Berosus is a very trustworthy man,
   and of this Juba is a witness, who, writing concerning the Assyrians,
   says that he learned the history from Berosus: there are two books of
   his concerning the Assyrians.

      Chapter XXXVII.--Testimony of the Phoenicians.

   After the Chaldeans, the testimony of the Phoenicians is as follows.
   There were among them three men, Theodotus, Hypsicrates, and Mochus;
   Chaitus translated their books into Greek, and also composed with
   exactness the lives of the philosophers. Now, in the histories of the
   aforesaid writers it is shown that the abduction of Europa happened
   under one of the kings, and an account is given of the coming of
   Menelaus into Phoenicia, and of the matters relating to Chiramus, [511]
   who gave his daughter in marriage to Solomon the king of the Jews, and
   supplied wood of all kind of trees for the building of the temple.
   Menander of Pergamus composed a history concerning the same things. But
   the age of Chiramus is somewhere about the Trojan war; but Solomon, the
   contemporary of Chiramus, lived much later than the age of Moses.

      Chapter XXXVIII.--The Egyptians Place Moses in the Reign of Inachus.

   Of the Egyptians also there are accurate chronicles. Ptolemy, not the
   king, but a priest of Mendes, is the interpreter of their affairs. This
   writer, narrating the acts of the kings, says that the departure of the
   Jews from Egypt to the places whither they went occurred in the time of
   king Amosis, under the leadership of Moses. He thus speaks: "Amosis
   lived in the time of king Inachus." After him, Apion the grammarian, a
   man most highly esteemed, in the fourth book of his Ægyptiaca (there
   are five books of his), besides many other things, says that Amosis
   destroyed Avaris in the time of the Argive Inachus, as the Mendesian
   Ptolemy wrote in his annals. But the time from Inachus to the taking of
   Troy occupies twenty generations. The steps of the demonstration are
   the following:--
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXXIX.--Catalogue of the Argive Kings.

   The kings of the Argives were these: Inachus, Phoroneus, Apis, Criasis,
   Triopas, Argeius, Phorbas, Crotopas, Sthenelaus, Danaus, Lynceus,
   Proetus, Abas, Acrisius, Perseus, Sthenelaus, Eurystheus, Atreus,
   Thyestes, and Agamemnon, in the eighteenth year of whose reign Troy was
   taken. And every intelligent person will most carefully observe that,
   according to the tradition of the Greeks, they possessed no historical
   composition; for Cadmus, who taught them letters, came into Boeotia
   many generations later. But after Inachus, under Phoroneus, a check was
   with difficulty given to their savage and nomadic life, and they
   entered upon a new order of things. Wherefore, if Moses is shown to be
   contemporary with Inachus, he is four hundred years older than the
   Trojan war. But this is demonstrated from the succession of the Attic,
   [and of the Macedonian, the Ptolemaic, and the Antiochian] [512] kings.
   Hence, if the most illustrious deeds among the Greeks were recorded and
   made known after Inachus, it is manifest that this must have been after
   Moses. In the time of Phoroneus, who was after Inachus, Ogygus is
   mentioned among the Athenians, in whose time was the first deluge; and
   in the time of Phorbas was Actæus, from whom Attica was called Actæa;
   and in the time of Triopas were Prometheus, and Epimetheus, and Atlas,
   and Cecrops of double nature, and Io; in the time of Crotopas was the
   burning of Phaëthon and the flood of Deucalion; in the time of
   Sthenelus was the reign of Amphictyon and the coming of Danaus into
   Peloponnesus, and the founding of Dardania by Dardanus, and the return
   of Europa from Phoenicia to Crete; in the time of Lynceus was the
   abduction of Koré, and the founding of the temple in Eleusis, and the
   husbandry of Triptolemus, and the coming of Cadmus to Thebes, and the
   reign of Minos; in the time of Proetus was the war of Eumolpus against
   the Athenians; in the time of Acrisius was the coming over of Pelops
   from Phrygia, and the coming of Ion to Athens, and the second Cecrops,
   and the deeds of Perseus and Dionysus, and Musæus, the disciple of
   Orpheus; and in the reign of Agamemnon Troy was taken.

      Chapter XL.--Moses More Ancient and Credible Than the Heathen Heroes.

   Therefore, from what has been said it is evident that Moses was older
   than the ancient heroes, wars, and demons. And we ought rather to
   believe him, who stands before them in point of age, than the Greeks,
   who, without being aware of it, [513] drew his doctrines [as] from a
   fountain. For many of the sophists among them, stimulated by curiosity,
   endeavoured to adulterate whatever they learned from Moses, [514] and
   from those who have philosophized like him, first that they might be
   considered as having something of their own, and secondly, that
   covering up by a certain rhetorical artifice whatever things they did
   not understand, they might misrepresent the truth as if it were a
   fable. But what the learned among the Greeks have said concerning our
   polity and the history of our laws, and how many and what kind of men
   have written of these things, will be shown in the treatise against
   those who have discoursed of divine things. [515]

      Chapter XLI.

   But the matter of principal importance is to endeavour with all
   accuracy to make it clear that Moses is not only older than Homer, but
   than all the writers that were before him--older than Linus, Philammon,
   Thamyris, Amphion, Musæus, Orpheus, Demodocus, Phemius, Sibylla,
   Epimenides of Crete, who came to Sparta, Aristæus of Proconnesus, who
   wrote the Arimaspia, Asbolus the Centaur, Isatis, Drymon, Euclus the
   Cyprian, Horus the Samian, and Pronapis the Athenian. Now, Linus was
   the teacher of Hercules, but Hercules preceded the Trojan war by one
   generation; and this is manifest from his son Tlepolemus, who served in
   the army against Troy. And Orpheus lived at the same time as Hercules;
   moreover, it is said that all the works attributed to him were composed
   by Onomacritus the Athenian, who lived during the reign of the
   Pisistratids, about the fiftieth Olympiad. Musæus was a disciple of
   Orpheus. Amphion, since he preceded the siege of Troy by two
   generations, forbids our collecting further particulars about him for
   those who are desirous of information. Demodocus and Phemius lived at
   the very time of the Trojan war; for the one resided with the suitors,
   and the other with the Phoeacians. Thamyris and Philammon were not much
   earlier than these. Thus, concerning their several performances in each
   kind, and their times and the record of them, we have written very
   fully, and, as I think, with all exactness. But, that we may complete
   what is still wanting, I will give my explanation respecting the men
   who are esteemed wise. Minos, who has been thought to excel in every
   kind of wisdom, and mental acuteness, and legislative capacity, lived
   in the time of Lynceus, who reigned after Danaus in the eleventh
   generation after Inachus. Lycurgus, who was born long after the taking
   of Troy, gave laws to the Lacedemonians. Draco is found to have lived
   about the thirty-ninth Olympiad, Solon about the forty-sixth, and
   Pythagoras about the sixty-second. We have shown that the Olympiads
   commenced 407 years after the taking of Troy. These facts being
   demonstrated, we shall briefly remark concerning the age of the seven
   wise men. The oldest of these, Thales, lived about the fiftieth
   Olympiad; and I have already spoken briefly of those who came after
   him.

      Chapter XLII.--Concluding Statement as to the Author.

   These things, O Greeks, I Tatian, a disciple of the barbarian
   philosophy, [516] have composed for you. I was born in the land of the
   Assyrians, having been first instructed in your doctrines, and
   afterwards in those which I now undertake to proclaim. Henceforward,
   knowing who God is and what is His work, I present myself to you
   prepared for an examination [517] concerning my doctrines, while I
   adhere immoveably to that mode of life which is according to God. [518]

   etc. But I cannot part with Tatian nor think of Tertullian without
   recalling David's threnode: "There the shield of the mighty is vilely
   cast away ... . I am distressed for thee, my brother: ... very pleasant
   hast thou been unto me ... How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons
   of war perished!" Our own sad times have taught us similar lamentations
   for some who seemed for a time to be "burning and shining lights." God
   be merciful to poor frail men.]

  Fragments. [519]

      I.

   In his treatise, Concerning Perfection according to the Saviour, he
   writes, "Consent indeed fits for prayer, but fellowship in corruption
   weakens supplication. At any rate, by the permission he certainly,
   though delicately, forbids; for while he permits them to return to the
   same on account of Satan and incontinence, he exhibits a man who will
   attempt to serve two masters--God by the consent' (1 Cor. 7:5), but by
   want of consent, incontinence, fornication, and the devil."--Clem.
   Alex.: Strom., iii. c. 12.

      II.

   A certain person inveighs against generation, calling it corruptible
   and destructive; and some one does violence [to Scripture], applying to
   pro-creation the Saviour's words, "Lay not up treasure on earth, where
   moth and rust corrupt;" and he is not ashamed to add to these the words
   of the prophet: "You all shall grow old as a garment, and the moth
   shall devour you."

   And, in like manner, they adduce the saying concerning the resurrection
   of the dead, "The sons of that world neither marry nor are given in
   marriage."--Clem. Alex.: iii. c. 12, § 86.

      III.

   Tatian, who maintaining the imaginary flesh of Christ, pronounces all
   sexual connection impure, who was also the very violent heresiarch of
   the Encratites, employs an argument of this sort: "If any one sows to
   the flesh, of the flesh he shall reap corruption;" but he sows to the
   flesh who is joined to a woman; therefore he who takes a wife and sows
   in the flesh, of the flesh he shall reap corruption.--Hieron.: Com. in
   Ep. ad Gal.

      IV.

   Seceding from the Church, and being elated and puffed up by a conceit
   of his teacher, [520] as if he were superior to the rest, he formed his
   own peculiar type of doctrine. Imagining certain invisible Æons like
   those of Valentinus, and denouncing marriage as defilement and
   fornication in the same way as Marcion and Saturninus, and denying the
   salvation of Adam as an opinion of his own.--Irenæus: Adv. Hoer., i.
   28.

      V.

   Tatian attempting from time to time to make use of Paul's language,
   that in Adam all die, but ignoring that "where sin abounded, grace has
   much more abounded."--Irenæus: Adv. Heres., iii. 37.

      VI.

   Against Tatian, who says that the words, "Let there be light," are to
   be taken as a prayer. If He who uttered it knew a superior God, how is
   it that He says, "I am God, and there is none beside me"?

   He said that there are punishments for blasphemies, foolish talking,
   and licentious words, which are punished and chastised by the Logos.
   And he said that women were punished on account of their hair and
   ornaments by a power placed over those things, which also gave strength
   to Samson by his hair, and punishes those who by the ornament of their
   hair are urged on to fornication.--Clem. Alex.: Frag.

      VII.

   But Tatian, not understanding that the expression "Let there be" is not
   always precative but sometimes imperative, most impiously imagined
   concerning God, who said "Let there be light," that He prayed rather
   than commanded light to be, as if, as he impiously thought, God was in
   darkness.--Origen: De Orat.

      VIII.

   Tatian separates the old man and the new, but not, as we say,
   understanding the old man to be the law, and the new man to be the
   Gospel. We agree with him in saying the same thing, but not in the
   sense he wishes, abrogating the law as if it belonged to another
   God.--Clem. Alex.: Strom., iii. 12.

      IX.

   Tatian condemns and rejects not only marriage, but also meats which God
   has created for use.--Hieron.: Adv. Jovin., i. 3.

      X.

   "But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets,
   saying, Prophesy not." On this, perhaps, Tatian the chief of the
   Encratites endeavours to build his heresy, asserting that wine is not
   to be drunk, since it was commanded in the law that the Nazarites were
   not to drink wine, and now those who give the Nazarites wine are
   accused by the prophet.--Hieron.: Com. in Amos.

      XI.

   Tatian, the patriarch of the Encratites, who himself rejected some of
   Paul's Epistles, believed this especially, that is [addressed] to
   Titus, ought to be declared to be the apostle's, thinking little of the
   assertion of Marcion and others, who agree with him on this
   point.--Hieron.: Præf. in Com. ad Tit.

      XII.

   [Archelaus (a.d. 280), Bishop of Carrha in Mesopotamia, classes his
   countryman Tatian with "Marcion, Sabellius, and others who have made up
   for themselves a peculiar science," i.e., a theology of their
   own.--Routh: Reliquiæ, tom. v. p. 137. But see Edinburgh Series of this
   work, vol. xx. p. 267.]

  Introductory Note

    to

Theophilus of Antioch.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [Translated by the Rev. Marcus Dods, A.M.]

   [a.d. 115-168-181.] Eusebius praises the pastoral fidelity of the
   primitive pastors, in their unwearied labours to protect their flocks
   from the heresies with which Satan contrived to endanger the souls of
   believers. By exhortations and admonitions, and then again by oral
   discussions and refutations, contending with the heretics themselves,
   they were prompt to ward off the devouring beasts from the fold of
   Christ. Such is the praise due to Theophilus, in his opinion; and he
   cites especially his lost work against Marcion as "of no mean
   character." [521] He was one of the earliest commentators upon the
   Gospels, if not the first; and he seems to have been the earliest
   Christian historian of the Church of the Old Testament. His only
   remaining work, here presented, seems to have originated in an "oral
   discussion," such as Eusebius instances. But nobody seems to accord him
   due praise as the founder of the science of Biblical Chronology among
   Christians, save that his great successor in modern times, Abp. Usher,
   has not forgotten to pay him this tribute in the Prolegomena of his
   Annals. (Ed. Paris, 1673.)

   Theophilus occupies an interesting position, after Ignatius, in the
   succession of faithful men who represented Barnabas and other prophets
   and teachers of Antioch, [522] in that ancient seat, from which comes
   our name as Christians. I cannot forbear another reference to those
   recent authors who have so brilliantly illustrated and depicted the
   Antioch of the early Christians; [523] because, if we wish to
   understand Autolycus, we must feel the state of society which at once
   fascinated him, and disgusted Theophilus. The Fathers are dry to those
   only who lack imagination to reproduce their age, or who fail to study
   them geographically and chronologically. Besides this, one should bring
   to the study of their works, that sympathy springing from a burning
   love to Christ, which borrows its motto, in slightly altered words,
   from the noble saying of the African poet: "I am a Christian, and
   nothing which concerns Christianity do I consider foreign to myself."

   Theophilus comes down to us only as an apologist intimately allied in
   spirit to Justin and Irenæus; and he should have been placed with
   Tatian between these two, in our series, had not the inexorable laws of
   our compilation brought them into this volume. I need add no more to
   what follows from the translator, save only the expression of a hope
   that others will enjoy this author as I do, rating him very highly,
   even at the side of Athenagoras. He is severe, yet gentle too, in
   dealing with his antagonist; and he cannot be charged with a more
   sublime contempt for heathenism than St. Paul betrays in all his
   writings, abjuring even Plato and Socrates, and accentuating his maxim,
   "The world by wisdom knew not God." For him it was Christ to live; and
   I love Theophilus for this very fault, if it be such. He was of
   Antioch; and was content to be, simply and altogether, nothing but a
   Christian.

   The following is the original Introductory Notice--:

   Little is known of the personal history of Theophilus of Antioch. We
   gather from the following treatise that he was born a pagan (i. 14),
   and owed his conversion to Christianity to the careful study of the
   Holy Scriptures. Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iv. 20) declares that he was
   the sixth bishop of Antioch in Syria from the apostles, the names of
   his supposed predecessors being Eros, Cornelius, Hero, Ignatius, and
   Euodius. We also learn from the same writer, that Theophilus succeeded
   to the bishopric of Antioch in the eighth year of the reign of Marcus
   Aurelius, that is, in a.d. 168. He is related to have died either in
   a.d. 181, or in a.d. 188; some assigning him an episcopate of thirteen,
   and others of twenty-one, years.

   Theophilus is said by Eusebius, Jerome, and others, to have written
   several works against the heresies which prevailed in his day. He
   himself refers in the following treatise (ii. 30) to another of his
   compositions. Commentaries on the Gospels, arranged in the form of a
   harmony, and on the Book of Proverbs, are also ascribed to him by
   Jerome; but the sole remaining specimen of his writings consists of the
   three books that follow, addressed to his friend Autolycus. The
   occasion which called these forth is somewhat doubtful. It has been
   thought that they were written in refutation of a work which Autolycus
   had published against Christianity; but the more probable opinion is,
   that they were drawn forth by disparaging remarks made in conversation.
   The language of the writer (ii. 1) leads to this conclusion.

   In handling his subject, Theophilus goes over much the same ground as
   Justin Martyr and the rest of the early apologists. He is somewhat fond
   of fanciful interpretations of Scripture; but he evidently had a
   profound acquaintance with the inspired writings, and he powerfully
   exhibits their immense superiority in every respect over the heathen
   poetry and philosophy. The whole treatise was well fitted to lead on an
   intelligent pagan to the cordial acceptance of Christianity.

   [I venture to assign to Theophilus a conjectural date of birth,
   circiter a.d. 115. [524] ]

      Chapter I.--Autolycus an Idolater and Scorner of Christians.

   A fluent tongue and an elegant style afford pleasure and such praise as
   vainglory delights in, to wretched men who have been corrupted in mind;
   the lover of truth does not give heed to ornamented speeches, but
   examines the real matter of the speech, what it is, and what kind it
   is. Since, then, my friend, you have assailed me with empty words,
   boasting of your gods of wood and stone, hammered and cast, carved and
   graven, which neither see nor hear, for they are idols, and the works
   of men's hands; and since, besides, you call me a Christian, as if this
   were a damning name to bear, I, for my part, avow that I am a
   Christian, [525] and bear this name beloved of God, hoping to be
   serviceable [526] to God. For it is not the case, as you suppose, that
   the name of God is hard to bear; but possibly you entertain this
   opinion of God, because you are yourself yet unserviceable to Him.

      Chapter II.--That the Eyes of the Soul Must Be Purged Ere God Can Be Seen.

   But if you say, "Show me thy God," I would reply, "Show me yourself,
   [527] and I will show you my God." Show, then, that the eyes of your
   soul are capable of seeing, and the ears of your heart able to hear;
   for as those who look with the eyes of the body perceive earthly
   objects and what concerns this life, and discriminate at the same time
   between things that differ, whether light or darkness, white or black,
   deformed or beautiful, well-proportioned and symmetrical or
   disproportioned and awkward, or monstrous or mutilated; and as in like
   manner also, by the sense of hearing, we discriminate either sharp, or
   deep, or sweet sounds; so the same holds good regarding the eyes of the
   soul and the ears of the heart, that it is by them we are able to
   behold God. For God is seen by those who are enabled to see Him when
   they have the eyes of their soul opened: for all have eyes; but in some
   they are overspread, [528] and do not see the light of the sun. Yet it
   does not follow, because the blind do not see, that the light of the
   sun does not shine; but let the blind blame themselves and their own
   eyes. So also thou, O man, hast the eyes of thy soul overspread by thy
   sins and evil deeds. As a burnished mirror, so ought man to have his
   soul pure. When there is rust on the mirror, it is not possible that a
   man's face be seen in the mirror; so also when there is sin in a man,
   such a man cannot behold God. Do you, therefore, show me yourself,
   whether you are not an adulterer, or a fornicator, or a thief, or a
   robber, or a purloiner; whether you do not corrupt boys; whether you
   are not insolent, or a slanderer, or passionate, or envious, or proud,
   or supercilious; whether you are not a brawler, or covetous, or
   disobedient to parents; and whether you do not sell your children; for
   to those who do these things God is not manifest, unless they have
   first cleansed themselves from all impurity. All these things, then,
   involve you in darkness, as when a filmy defluxion on the eyes prevents
   one from beholding the light of the sun: thus also do iniquities, man,
   involve you in darkness, so that you cannot see God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   man, being probably intended.

     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter III.--Nature of God.

   You will say, then, to me, "Do you, who see God, explain to me the
   appearance of God." Hear, O man. The appearance of God is ineffable and
   indescribable, and cannot be seen by eyes of flesh. For in glory He is
   incomprehensible, in greatness unfathomable, in height inconceivable,
   in power incomparable, in wisdom unrivalled, in goodness inimitable, in
   kindness unutterable. For if I say He is Light, I name but His own
   work; if I call Him Word, I name but His sovereignty; if I call Him
   Mind, I speak but of His wisdom; if I say He is Spirit, I speak of His
   breath; if I call Him Wisdom, I speak of His offspring; if I call Him
   Strength, I speak of His sway; if I call Him Power, I am mentioning His
   activity; if Providence, I but mention His goodness; if I call Him
   Kingdom, I but mention His glory; if I call Him Lord, I mention His
   being judge; if I call Him Judge, I speak of Him as being just; if I
   call Him Father, I speak of all things as being from Him; [529] if I
   call Him Fire, I but mention His anger. You will say, then, to me, "Is
   God angry?" Yes; He is angry with those who act wickedly, but He is
   good, and kind, and merciful, to those who love and fear Him; for He is
   a chastener [530] of the godly, and father of the righteous; but he is
   a judge and punisher of the impious.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [529] The translation here follows the Hamburg editor, others read, "If
   Father, I say everything."

   [530] Maranus observes that Theophilus means to indicate the difference
   between God's chastisement of the righteous and His punishment of the
   wicked.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter IV.--Attributes of God.

   And He is without beginning, because He is unbegotten; and He is
   unchangeable, because He is immortal. And he is called God [Theos] on
   account of His having placed [tetheikenai] all things on security
   afforded by Himself; and on account of [theein], for theein means
   running, and moving, and being active, and nourishing, and foreseeing,
   and governing, and making all things alive. But he is Lord, because He
   rules over the universe; Father, because he is before all things;
   Fashioner and Maker, because He is creator and maker of the universe;
   the Highest, because of His being above all; and Almighty, because He
   Himself rules and embraces all. For the heights of heaven, and the
   depths of the abysses, and the ends of the earth, are in His hand, and
   there is no place of His rest. For the heavens are His work, the earth
   is His creation, the sea is His handiwork; man is His formation and His
   image; sun, moon, and stars are His elements, made for signs, and
   seasons, and days, and years, that they may serve and be slaves to man;
   and all things God has made out of things that were not [531] into
   things that are, in order that through His works His greatness may be
   known and understood.

      Chapter V.--The Invisible God Perceived Through His Works.

   For as the soul in man is not seen, being invisible to men, but is
   perceived through the motion of the body, so God cannot indeed be seen
   by human eyes, but is beheld and perceived through His providence and
   works. For, in like manner, as any person, when he sees a ship on the
   sea rigged and in sail, and making for the harbour, will no doubt infer
   that there is a pilot in her who is steering her; so we must perceive
   that God is the governor [pilot] of the whole universe, though He be
   not visible to the eyes of the flesh, since He is incomprehensible. For
   if a man cannot look upon the sun, though it be a very small heavenly
   body, on account of its exceeding heat and power, how shall not a
   mortal man be much more unable to face the glory of God, which is
   unutterable? For as the pomegranate, with the rind containing it, has
   within it many cells and compartments which are separated by tissues,
   and has also many seeds dwelling in it, so the whole creation is
   contained by the spirit [532] of God, and the containing spirit is
   along with the creation contained by the hand of God. As, therefore,
   the seed of the pomegranate, dwelling inside, cannot see what is
   outside the rind, itself being within; so neither can man, who along
   with the whole creation is enclosed by the hand of God, behold God.
   Then again, an earthly king is believed to exist, even though he be not
   seen by all; for he is recognised by his laws and ordinances, and
   authorities, and forces, and statues; and are you unwilling that God
   should be recognised by His works and mighty deeds?

      Chapter VI.--God is Known by His Works.

   Consider, O man, His works,--the timely rotation of the seasons, and
   the changes of temperature; the regular march of the stars; the
   well-ordered course of days and nights, and months, and years; the
   various beauty of seeds, and plants, and fruits; and the divers species
   [533] of quadrupeds, and birds, and reptiles, and fishes, both of the
   rivers and of the sea; or consider the instinct implanted in these
   animals to beget and rear offspring, not for their own profit, but for
   the use of man; and the providence with which God provides nourishment
   for all flesh, or the subjection in which He has ordained that all
   things subserve mankind. Consider, too, the flowing of sweet fountains
   and never-failing rivers, and the seasonable supply of dews, and
   showers, and rains; the manifold movement of the heavenly bodies, the
   morning star rising and heralding the approach of the perfect luminary;
   and the constellation of Pleiades, and Orion, and Arcturus, and the
   orbit of the other stars that circle through the heavens, all of which
   the manifold wisdom of God has called by names of their own. He is God
   alone who made light out of darkness, and brought forth light from His
   treasures, and formed the chambers of the south wind, [534] and the
   treasure-houses of the deep, and the bounds of the seas, and the
   treasuries of snows and hail-storms, collecting the waters in the
   storehouses of the deep, and the darkness in His treasures, and
   bringing forth the sweet, and desirable, and pleasant light out of His
   treasures; "who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the
   earth: He maketh lightnings for the rain;" [535] who sends forth His
   thunder to terrify, and foretells by the lightning the peal of the
   thunder, that no soul may faint with the sudden shock; and who so
   moderates the violence of the lightning as it flashes out of heaven,
   that it does not consume the earth; for, if the lightning were allowed
   all its power, it would burn up the earth; and were the thunder allowed
   all its power, it would overthrow all the works that are therein.

      Chapter VII.--We Shall See God When We Put on Immortality.

   This is my God, the Lord of all, who alone stretched out the heaven,
   and established the breadth of the earth under it; who stirs the deep
   recesses of the sea, and makes its waves roar; who rules its power, and
   stills the tumult of its waves; who founded the earth upon the waters,
   and gave a spirit to nourish it; whose breath giveth light to the
   whole, who, if He withdraw His breath, the whole will utterly fail. By
   Him you speak, O man; His breath you breathe yet Him you know not. And
   this is your condition, because of the blindness of your soul, and the
   hardness of your heart. But, if you will, you may be healed. Entrust
   yourself to the Physician, and He will couch the eyes of your soul and
   of your heart. Who is the Physician? God, who heals and makes alive
   through His word and wisdom. God by His own word and wisdom made all
   things; for "by His word were the heavens made, and all the host of
   them by the breath of His mouth." [536] Most excellent is His wisdom.
   By His wisdom God founded the earth; and by knowledge He prepared the
   heavens; and by understanding were the fountains of the great deep
   broken up, and the clouds poured out their dews. If thou perceivest
   these things, O man, living chastely, and holily, and righteously, thou
   canst see God. But before all let faith and the fear of God have rule
   in thy heart, and then shalt thou understand these things. When thou
   shalt have put off the mortal, and put on incorruption, then shall thou
   see God worthily. For God will raise thy flesh immortal with thy soul;
   and then, having become immortal, thou shalt see the Immortal, if now
   you believe on Him; and then you shall know that you have spoken
   unjustly against Him.

      Chapter VIII.--Faith Required in All Matters.

   But you do not believe that the dead are raised. When the resurrection
   shall take place, then you will believe, whether you will or no; and
   your faith shall be reckoned for unbelief, unless you believe now. And
   why do you not believe? Do you not know that faith is the leading
   principle in all matters? For what husbandman can reap, unless he first
   trust his seed to the earth? Or who can cross the sea, unless he first
   entrust himself to the boat and the pilot? And what sick person can be
   healed, unless first he trust himself to the care of the physician? And
   what art or knowledge can any one learn, unless he first apply and
   entrust himself to the teacher? If, then, the husbandman trusts the
   earth, and the sailor the boat, and the sick the physician, will you
   not place confidence in God, even when you hold so many pledges at His
   hand? For first He created you out of nothing, and brought you into
   existence (for if your father was not, nor your mother, much more were
   you yourself at one time not in being), and formed you out of a small
   and moist substance, even out of the least drop, which at one time had
   itself no being; and God introduced you into this life. Moreover, you
   believe that the images made by men are gods, and do great things; and
   can you not believe that the God who made you is able also to make you
   afterwards? [537]

      Chapter IX.--Immoralities of the Gods.

   And, indeed, the names of those whom you say you worship, are the names
   of dead men. And these, too, who and what kind of men were they? Is not
   Saturn found to be a cannibal, destroying and devouring his own
   children? And if you name his son Jupiter, hear also his deeds and
   conduct--first, how he was suckled by a goat on Mount Ida, and having
   slain it, according to the myths, and flayed it, he made himself a coat
   of the hide. And his other deeds,--his incest, and adultery, and
   lust,--will be better recounted by Homer and the rest of the poets. Why
   should I further speak of his sons? How Hercules burnt himself; and
   about the drunk and raging Bacchus; and of Apollo fearing and fleeing
   from Achilles, and falling in love with Daphne, and being unaware of
   the fate of Hyacinthus; and of Venus wounded, and of Mars, the pest of
   mortals; and of the ichor flowing from the so-called gods. And these,
   indeed, are the milder kinds of legends; since the god who is called
   Osiris is found to have been torn limb from limb, whose mysteries are
   celebrated annually, as if he had perished, and were being found, and
   sought for limb by limb. For neither is it known whether he perished,
   nor is it shown whether he is found. And why should I speak of Atys
   mutilated, or of Adonis wandering in the wood, and wounded by a boar
   while hunting; or of Æsculapius struck by a thunderbolt; or of the
   fugitive Serapis chased from Sinope to Alexandria; or of the Scythian
   Diana, herself, too, a fugitive, and a homicide, and a huntress, and a
   passionate lover of Endymion? Now, it is not we who publish these
   things, but your own writers and poets.

      Chapter X.--Absurdities of Idolatry.

   Why should I further recount the multitude of animals worshipped by the
   Egyptians, both reptiles, and cattle, and wild beasts, and birds, and
   river-fishes; and even wash-pots [538] and disgraceful noises? [539]
   But if you cite the Greeks and the other nations, they worship stones
   and wood, and other kinds of material substances,--the images, as we
   have just been saying, of dead men. For Phidias is found in Pisa making
   for the Eleians the Olympian Jupiter, and at Athens the Minerva of the
   Acropolis. And I will inquire of you, my friend, how many Jupiters
   exist. For there is, firstly, Jupiter surnamed Olympian, then Jupiter
   Latiaris, and Jupiter Cassius, and Jupiter Tonans, and Jupiter
   Propator, and Jupiter Pannychius, and Jupiter Poliuchus, and Jupiter
   Capitolinus; and that Jupiter, the son of Saturn, who is king of the
   Cretans, has a tomb in Crete, but the rest, possibly, were not thought
   worthy of tombs. And if you speak of the mother of those who are called
   gods, far be it from me to utter with my lips her deeds, or the deeds
   of those by whom she is worshipped (for it is unlawful for us so much
   as to name such things), and what vast taxes and revenues she and her
   sons furnish to the king. For these are not gods, but idols, as we have
   already said, the works of men's hands and unclean demons. And such may
   all those become who make them and put their trust in them!

      Chapter XI.--The King to Be Honoured, God to Be Worshipped.

   Wherefore I will rather honour the king [than your gods], not, indeed,
   worshipping him, but praying for him. But God, the living and true God,
   I worship, knowing that the king is made by Him. You will say, then, to
   me, "Why do you not worship the king?" Because he is not made to be
   worshipped, but to be reverenced with lawful honour, for he is not a
   god, but a man appointed by God, not to be worshipped, but to judge
   justly. For in a kind of way his government is committed to him by God:
   as He will not have those called kings whom He has appointed under
   Himself; for "king" is his title, and it is not lawful for another to
   use it; so neither is it lawful for any to be worshipped but God only.
   Wherefore, O man, you are wholly in error. Accordingly, honour the
   king, be subject to him, and pray for him with loyal mind; for if you
   do this, you do the will of God. For the law that is of God, says, "My
   son, fear thou the Lord and the king, and be not disobedient to them;
   for suddenly they shall take vengeance on their enemies." [540]

      Chapter XII.--Meaning of the Name Christian.

   And about your laughing at me and calling me "Christian," you know not
   what you are saying. First, because that which is anointed [541] is
   sweet and serviceable, and far from contemptible. For what ship can be
   serviceable and seaworthy, unless it be first caulked [anointed]? Or
   what castle or house is beautiful and serviceable when it has not been
   anointed? And what man, when he enters into this life or into the
   gymnasium, is not anointed with oil? And what work has either ornament
   or beauty unless it be anointed and burnished? Then the air and all
   that is under heaven is in a certain sort anointed by light and spirit;
   and are you unwilling to be anointed with the oil of God? Wherefore we
   are called Christians on this account, because we are anointed with the
   oil of God. [542]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [541] "The argumentation of this chapter depends on the literal meaning
   which Theophilus attaches to Christos, the Anointed One; and he plays
   on this meaning, and also on the similarity of pronunciation between
   chrestos, useful,' and christos , anointed.'"--Donaldson.

   [542] [Not material oil probably, for it is not mentioned in such
   Scriptures as Acts viii. 17, xix. 6, Heb. vi. 2; but the anointing (1
   John ii. 20) of the Holy Ghost. As a symbol, oil was used at an early
   period, however; and the Latins are not slow to press this in favour of
   material oil in the chrism, or confirmation.]

      Chapter XIII.--The Resurrection Proved by Examples.

   Then, as to your denying that the dead are raised--for you say, [543]
   "Show me even one who has been raised from the dead, that seeing I may
   believe,"--first, what great thing is it if you believe when you have
   seen the thing done? Then, again, you believe that Hercules, who burned
   himself, lives; and that Æsculapius, who was struck with lightning, was
   raised; and do you disbelieve the things that are told you by God? But,
   suppose I should show you a dead man raised and alive, even this you
   would disbelieve. God indeed exhibits to you many proofs that you may
   believe Him. For consider, if you please, the dying of seasons, and
   days, and nights, how these also die and rise again. And what? Is there
   not a resurrection going on of seeds and fruits, and this, too, for the
   use of men? A seed of wheat, for example, or of the other grains, when
   it is cast into the earth, first dies and rots away, then is raised,
   and becomes a stalk of corn. And the nature of trees and
   fruit-trees,--is it not that according to the appointment of God they
   produce their fruits in their seasons out of what has been unseen and
   invisible? Moreover, sometimes also a sparrow or some of the other
   birds, when in drinking it has swallowed a seed of apple or fig, or
   something else, has come to some rocky hillock or tomb, and has left
   the seed in its droppings, and the seed, which was once swallowed, and
   has passed though so great a heat, now striking root, a tree has grown
   up. And all these things does the wisdom of God effect, in order to
   manifest even by these things, that God is able to effect the general
   resurrection of all men. And if you would witness a more wonderful
   sight, which may prove a resurrection not only of earthly but of
   heavenly bodies, consider the resurrection of the moon, which occurs
   monthly; how it wanes, dies, and rises again. Hear further, O man, of
   the work of resurrection going on in yourself, even though you are
   unaware of it. For perhaps you have sometimes fallen sick, and lost
   flesh, and strength, and beauty; but when you received again from God
   mercy and healing, you picked up again in flesh and appearance, and
   recovered also your strength. And as you do not know where your flesh
   went away and disappeared to, so neither do you know whence it grew, Or
   whence it came again. But you will say, "From meats and drinks changed
   into blood." Quite so; but this, too, is the work of God, who thus
   operates, and not of any other.

   [543] [This is the famous challenge which affords Gibbon (cap. xv.) a

      Chapter XIV.--Theophilus an Example of Conversion.

   Therefore, do not be sceptical, but believe; for I myself also used to
   disbelieve that this would take place, but now, having taken these
   things into consideration, I believe. At the same time, I met with the
   sacred Scriptures [544] of the holy prophets, who also by the Spirit of
   God foretold the things that have already happened, just as they came
   to pass, and the things now occurring as they are now happening, and
   things future in the order in which they shall be accomplished.
   Admitting, therefore, the proof which events happening as predicted
   afford, I do not disbelieve, but I believe, obedient to God, whom, if
   you please, do you also submit to, believing Him, lest if now you
   continue unbelieving, you be convinced hereafter, when you are
   tormented with eternal punishments; which punishments, when they had
   been foretold by the prophets, the later-born poets and philosophers
   stole from the holy Scriptures, to make their doctrines worthy of
   credit. Yet these also have spoken beforehand of the punishments that
   are to light upon the profane and unbelieving, in order that none be
   left without a witness, or be able to say, "We have not heard, neither
   have we known." But do you also, if you please, give reverential
   attention to the prophetic Scriptures, [545] and they will make your
   way plainer for escaping the eternal punishments, and obtaining the
   eternal prizes of God. For He who gave the mouth for speech, and formed
   the ear to hear, and made the eye to see, will examine all things, and
   will judge righteous judgment, rendering merited awards to each. To
   those who by patient continuance in well-doing [546] seek immortality,
   He will give life everlasting, joy, peace, rest, and abundance of good
   things, which neither hath eye seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered
   into the heart of man to conceive. [547] But to the unbelieving and
   despisers, who obey not the truth, but are obedient to unrighteousness,
   when they shall have been filled with adulteries and fornications, and
   filthiness, and covetousness, and unlawful idolatries, there shall be
   anger and wrath, tribulation and anguish, [548] and at the last
   everlasting fire shall possess such men. Since you said, "Show me thy
   God," this is my God, and I counsel you to fear Him and to trust Him.

   When we had formerly some conversation, my very good friend Autolycus,
   and when you inquired who was my God, and for a little paid attention
   to my discourse, I made some explanations to you concerning my
   religion; and then having bid one another adieu, we went with much
   mutual friendliness each to his own house, although at first you had
   borne somewhat hard upon me. For you know and remember that you
   supposed our doctrine was foolishness. As you then afterwards urged me
   to do, I am desirous, though not educated to the art of speaking, of
   more accurately demonstrating, by means of this tractate, the vain
   labour and empty worship in which you are held; and I wish also, from a
   few of your own histories which you read, and perhaps do not yet quite
   understand, to make the truth plain to you.

      Chapter II.--The Gods are Despised When They are Made; But Become Valuable
      When Bought.

   And in truth it does seem to me absurd that statuaries and carvers, or
   painters, or moulders, should both design and paint, and carve, and
   mould, and prepare gods, who, when they are produced by the artificers,
   are reckoned of no value; but as soon as they are purchased [549] by
   some and placed in some so-called temple, or in some house, not only do
   those who bought them sacrifice to them, but also those who made and
   sold them come with much devotion, and apparatus of sacrifice, and
   libations, to worship them; and they reckon them gods, not seeing that
   they are just such as when they were made by themselves, whether stone,
   or brass, or wood, or colour, or some other material. And this is your
   case, too, when you read the histories and genealogies of the so-called
   gods. For when you read of their births, you think of them as men, but
   afterwards you call them gods, and worship them, not reflecting nor
   understanding that, when born, they are exactly such beings as ye read
   of before.

      Chapter III.--What Has Become of the Gods?

   And of the gods of former times, if indeed they were begotten, the
   generation was sufficiently prolific. But now, where is their
   generation exhibited? For if of old they begot and were begotten, it is
   plain that even to the present time there should be gods begotten and
   born; or at least if it be not so, such a race will be reckoned
   impotent. For either they have waxed old, and on that account no longer
   beget, or they have died out and no longer exist. For if the gods were
   begotten, they ought to be born even until now, as men, too, are born;
   yea, much more numerous should the gods be than men, as the Sibyl
   says:--


   "For if the gods beget, and each remains

   Immortal, then the race of gods must be

   More numerous than mortals, and the throng

   So great that mortals find no room to stand."

   For if the children begotten of men who are mortal and short-lived make
   an appearance even until now, and men have not ceased to be born, so
   that cities and villages are full, and even the country places also are
   inhabited, how ought not the gods, who, according to your poets, do not
   die, much rather to beget and be begotten, since you say that the gods
   were produced by generation? And why was the mount which is called
   Olympus formerly inhabited by the gods, but now lies deserted? Or why
   did Jupiter, in days of yore, dwell on Ida, and was known to dwell
   there, according to Homer and other poets, but now is beyond ken? And
   why was he found only in one part of the earth, and not everywhere? For
   either he neglected the other parts, or was not able to be present
   everywhere and provide for all. For if he were, e.g., in an eastern
   place, he was not in the western; and if, on the other hand, he were
   present in the western parts, he was not in the eastern. But this is
   the attribute of God, the Highest and Almighty, and the living God, not
   only to be everywhere present, but also to see all things and to hear
   all, and by no means to be confined in a place; for if He were, then
   the place containing Him would be greater than He; for that which
   contains is greater than that which is contained. For God is not
   contained, but is Himself the place of all. But why has Jupiter left
   Ida? Was it because he died, or did that mountain no longer please him?
   And where has he gone? To heaven? No. But you will perhaps say, To
   Crete? Yes, for there, too, his tomb is shown to this day. Again, you
   will say, To Pisa, where he reflects glory on the hands of Phidias to
   this day. Let us, then, proceed to the writings of the philosophers and
   poets.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter IV.--Absurd Opinions of the Philosophers Concerning God.

   Some of the philosophers of the Porch say that there is no God at all;
   or, if there is, they say that He cares for none but Himself; and these
   views the folly of Epicurus and Chrysippus has set forth at large. And
   others say that all things are produced without external agency, and
   that the world is uncreated, and that nature is eternal; [550] and have
   dared to give out that there is no providence of God at all, but
   maintain that God is only each man's conscience. And others again
   maintain that the spirit which pervades all things is God. But Plato
   and those of his school acknowledge indeed that God is uncreated, and
   the Father and Maker of all things; but then they maintain that matter
   as well as God is uncreated, and aver that it is coeval with God. But
   if God is uncreated and matter uncreated, God is no longer, according
   to the Platonists, the Creator of all things, nor, so far as their
   opinions hold, is the monarchy [551] of God established. And further,
   as God, because He is uncreated, is also unalterable; so if matter,
   too, were uncreated, it also would be unalterable, and equal to God;
   for that which is created is mutable and alterable, but that which is
   uncreated is immutable and unalterable. And what great thing is it if
   God made the world out of existent materials? [552] For even a human
   artist, when he gets material from some one, makes of it what he
   pleases. But the power of God is manifested in this, that out of things
   that are not He makes whatever He pleases; just as the bestowal of life
   and motion is the prerogative of no other than God alone. For even man
   makes indeed an image, but reason and breath, or feeling, he cannot
   give to what he has made. But God has this property in excess of what
   man can do, in that He makes a work, endowed with reason, life,
   sensation. As, therefore, in all these respects God is more powerful
   than man, so also in this; that out of things that are not He creates
   and has created things that are, and whatever He pleases, as He
   pleases.

   [550] This is according to the Benedictine reading: the reading of

     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter V.--Opinions of Homer and Hesiod Concerning the Gods.

   So that the opinion of your philosophers and authors is discordant; for
   while the former have propounded the foregoing opinions, the poet Homer
   is found explaining the origin not only of the world, but also of the
   gods, on quite another hypothesis. For he says somewhere: [553] --


   "Father of Gods, Oceanus, and she

   Who bare the gods, their mother Tethys, too,

   From whom all rivers spring, and every sea."

   In saying which, however, he does not present God to us. For who does
   not know that the ocean is water? But if water, then not God. God
   indeed, if He is the creator of all things, as He certainly is, is the
   creator both of the water and of the seas. And Hesiod himself also
   declared the origin, not only of the gods, but also of the world
   itself. And though he said that the world was created, he showed no
   inclination to tell us by whom it was created. Besides, he said that
   Saturn, and his sons Jupiter, Neptune, and Pluto, were gods, though we
   find that they are later born than the world. And he also relates how
   Saturn was assailed in war by his own son Jupiter; for he says: [554]
   --


   "His father Saturn he by might o'ercame,

   And 'mong th' immortals ruled with justice wise,

   And honours fit distributed to each."

   Then he introduces in his poem the daughters of Jupiter, whom he names
   Muses, and as whose suppliant he appears, desiring to ascertain from
   them how all things were made; for he says: [555] --


   "Daughters of Jove, all hail! Grant me your aid

   That I in numbers sweet and well-arrayed,

   Of the immortal gods may sing the birth;

   Who of the starry heav'ns were born, and earth;

   Who, springing from the murky night at first,

   Were by the briny ocean reared and nursed.

   Tell, too, who form unto the earth first gave,

   And rivers, and the boundless sea whose wave

   Unwearied sinks, then rears its crest on high;

   And how was spread yon glittering canopy

   Of glistening stars that stud the wide-spread heaven.

   Whence sprang the gods by whom all good is given?

   Tell from their hands what varied gifts there came,

   Riches to some, to others wealth, or fame;

   How they have dwelt from the remotest time

   In many-nooked Olympus' sunny clime.

   These things, ye Muses, say, who ever dwell

   Among Olympian shades--since ye can tell:

   From the beginning there thy feet have strayed;

   Then tell us which of all things first was made."

   But how could the Muses, who are younger than the world, know these
   things? Or how could they relate to Hesiod [what was happening], when
   their father was not yet born?

      Chapter VI.--Hesiod on the Origin of the World.

   And in a certain way he indeed admits matter [as self-existent] and the
   creation of the world [without a creator], saying: [556] --


   "First of all things was chaos made, and next

   Broad-bosom'd earth's foundations firm were fixed,

   Where safely the immortals dwell for aye,

   Who in the snowy-peak'd Olympus stay.

   Afterwards gloomy Tartarus had birth

   In the recesses of broad-pathwayed earth,

   And Love, ev'n among gods most beauteous still,

   Who comes all-conquering, bending mind and will,

   Delivering from care, and giving then

   Wise counsel in the breasts of gods and men.

   From chaos Erebus and night were born,

   From night and Erebus sprung air and morn.

   Earth in her likeness made the starry heaven,

   That unto all things shelter might be given,

   And that the blessed gods might there repose.

   The lofty mountains by her power arose,

   For the wood-nymphs she made the pleasant caves,

   Begot the sterile sea with all his waves,

   Loveless; but when by heaven her love was sought,

   Then the deep-eddying ocean forth she brought."

   And saying this, he has not yet explained by whom all this was made.
   For if chaos existed in the beginning, and matter of some sort, being
   uncreated, was previously existing, who was it that effected the change
   on its condition, and gave it a different order and shape? Did matter
   itself alter its own form and arrange itself into a world (for Jupiter
   was born, not only long after matter, but long after the world and many
   men; and so, too, was his father Saturn), or was there some ruling
   power which made it; I mean, of course, God, who also fashioned it into
   a world? Besides, he is found in every way to talk nonsense, and to
   contradict himself. For when he mentions earth, and sky, and sea, he
   gives us to understand that from these the gods were produced; and from
   these again [the gods] he declares that certain very dreadful men were
   sprung,--the race of the Titans and the Cyclopes, and a crowd of
   giants, and of the Egyptian gods,--or, rather, vain men, as
   Apollonides, surnamed Horapius, mentions in the book entitled
   Semenouthi, and in his other histories concerning the worship of the
   Egyptians and their kings, and the vain labours in which they engaged.

      Chapter VII.--Fabulous Heathen Genealogies.

   Why need I recount the Greek fables,--of Pluto, king of darkness, of
   Neptune descending beneath the sea, and embracing Melanippe and
   begetting a cannibal son,--or the many tales your writers have woven
   into their tragedies concerning the sons of Jupiter, and whose pedigree
   they register because they were born men, and not gods? And the comic
   poet Aristophanes, in the play called "The Birds," having taken upon
   him to handle the subject of the Creation, said that in the beginning
   the world was produced from an egg, saying: [558] --


   "A windy egg was laid by black-winged night

   At first."

   But Satyrus, also giving a history of the Alexandrine families,
   beginning from Philopator, who was also named Ptolemy, gives out that
   Bacchus was his progenitor; wherefore also Ptolemy was the founder of
   this [559] family. Satyrus then speaks thus: That Dejanira was born of
   Bacchus and Althea, the daughter of Thestius; and from her and Hercules
   the son of Jupiter there sprang, as I suppose, Hyllus; and from him
   Cleodemus, and from him Aristomachus, and from him Temenus, and from
   him Ceisus, and from him Maron, and from him Thestrus, and from him
   Acous, and from him Aristomidas, and from him Caranus, and from him
   Coenus, and from him Tyrimmas, and from him Perdiccas, and from him
   Philip, and from him Æropus, and from him Alcetas, and from him
   Amyntas, and from him Bocrus, and from him Meleager, and from him
   Arsinoë and from her and Lagus Ptolemy Soter, and from him and Arsinoe
   Ptolemy Euergetes, and from him and Berenicé, daughter of Maga, king of
   Cyrene, Ptolemy Philopator. Thus, then, stands the relationship of the
   Alexandrine kings to Bacchus. And therefore in the Dionysian tribe
   there are distinct families: the Althean from Althea, who was the wife
   of Dionysus and daughter of Thestius; the family of Dejanira also, from
   her who was the daughter of Dionysus and Althea, and wife of
   Hercules;--whence, too, the families have their names: the family of
   Ariadne, from Ariadne, daughter of Minos and wife of Dionysus, a
   dutiful daughter, who had intercourse with Dionysus in another form;
   the Thestian, from Thestius, the father of Althea; the Thoantian, from
   Thoas, son of Dionysus; the Staphylian, from Staphylus, son of
   Dionysus; the Euænian, from Eunous, son of Dionysus; the Maronian, from
   Maron, son of Ariadne and Dionysus;--for all these are sons of
   Dionysus. And, indeed, many other names were thus originated, and exist
   to this day; as the Heraclidæ from Hercules, and the Apollonidæ from
   Apollo, and the Poseidonii from Poseidon, and from Zeus the Dii and
   Diogenæ.

      Chapter VIII.-- Opinions Concerning Providence.

   And why should I recount further the vast array of such names and
   genealogies? So that all the authors and poets, and those called
   philosophers, are wholly deceived; and so, too, are they who give heed
   to them. For they plentifully composed fables and foolish stories about
   their gods, and did not exhibit them as gods, but as men, and men, too,
   of whom some were drunken, and others fornicators and murderers. But
   also concerning the origin of the world, they uttered contradictory and
   absurd opinions. First, some of them, as we before explained,
   maintained that the world is uncreated. And those that said it was
   uncreated and self-producing contradicted those who propounded that it
   was created. For by conjecture and human conception they spoke, and not
   knowing the truth. And others, again, said that there was a providence,
   and destroyed the positions of the former writers. Aratus, indeed,
   says: [560] --


   "From Jove begin my song; nor ever be

   The name unuttered: all are full of thee;

   The ways and haunts of men; the heavens and sea:

   On thee our being hangs; in thee we move;

   All are thy offspring and the seed of Jove.

   Benevolent, he warns mankind to good,

   Urges to toil and prompts the hope of food.

   He tells where cattle best may graze, and where

   The soil, deep-furrowed, yellow grain will bear.

   What time the husbandman should plant or sow,

   'Tis his to tell, 'tis his alone to know."

   Who, then, shall we believe: Aratus as here quoted, or Sophocles, when
   he says: [561] --


   "And foresight of the future there is none;

   'Tis best to live at random, as one can"?

   And Homer, again, does not agree with this, for he says [562] that
   virtue


   "Waxes or wanes in men as Jove decrees."

   And Simonides says:--


   "No man nor state has virtue save from God;

   Counsel resides in God; and wretched man

   Has in himself nought but his wretchedness."

   So, too, Euripides:--


   "Apart from God, there's nothing owned by men."

   And Menander:--


   "Save God alone, there's none for us provides."

   And Euripides again:--


   "For when God wills to save, all things He'll bend

   To serve as instruments to work His end."

   And Thestius:--


   "If God design to save you, safe you are,

   Though sailing in mid-ocean on a mat." [563]

   And saying numberless things of a like kind, they contradicted
   themselves. At least Sophocles, who in another place denied Providence,
   says:--


   "No mortal can evade the stroke of God."

   Besides, they both introduced a multitude of gods, and yet spoke of a
   Unity; and against those who affirmed a Providence they maintained in
   opposition that there was no Providence. Wherefore Euripides says:--


   "We labour much and spend our strength in vain,

   For empty hope, not foresight, is our guide."

   And without meaning to do so, they acknowledge that they know not the
   truth; but being inspired by demons and puffed up by them, they spoke
   at their instance whatever they said. For indeed the poets,--Homer, to
   wit, and Hesiod, being, as they say, inspired by the Muses,--spoke from
   a deceptive fancy, [564] and not with a pure but an erring spirit. And
   this, indeed, clearly appears from the fact, that even to this day the
   possessed are sometimes exorcised in the name of the living and true
   God; and these spirits of error themselves confess that they are demons
   who also formerly inspired these writers. But sometimes some of them
   wakened up in soul, and, that they might be for a witness both to
   themselves and to all men, spoke things in harmony with the prophets
   regarding the monarchy of God, and the judgment and such like.

      Chapter IX.--The Prophets Inspired by the Holy Ghost.

   But men of God carrying in them a holy spirit [565] and becoming
   prophets, being inspired and made wise by God, became God-taught, and
   holy, and righteous. Wherefore they were also deemed worthy of
   receiving this reward, that they should become instruments of God, and
   contain the wisdom that is from Him, through which wisdom they uttered
   both what regarded the creation of the world and all other things. For
   they predicted also pestilences, and famines, and wars. And there was
   not one or two, but many, at various times and seasons among the
   Hebrews; and also among the Greeks there was the Sibyl; and they all
   have spoken things consistent and harmonious with each other, both what
   happened before them and what happened in their own time, and what
   things are now being fulfilled in our own day: wherefore we are
   persuaded also concerning the future things that they will fall out, as
   also the first have been accomplished.

      Chapter X.--The World Created by God Through the Word.

   And first, they taught us with one consent that God made all things out
   of nothing; for nothing was coeval with God: but He being His own
   place, and wanting nothing, and existing before the ages, willed to
   make man by whom He might be known; for him, therefore, He prepared the
   world. For he that is created is also needy; but he that is uncreated
   stands in need of nothing. God, then, having His own Word internal
   [566] within His own bowels, begat Him, emitting [567] Him along with
   His own wisdom before all things. He had this Word as a helper in the
   things that were created by Him, and by Him He made all things. He is
   called "governing principle" [harke], because He rules, and is Lord of
   all things fashioned by Him. He, then, being Spirit of God, and
   governing principle, and wisdom, and power of the highest, came down
   upon the prophets, and through them spoke of the creation of the world
   and of all other things. For the prophets were not when the world came
   into existence, but the wisdom of God which was in Him, and His holy
   Word which was always present with Him. Wherefore He speaks thus by the
   prophet Solomon: "When He prepared the heavens I was there, and when He
   appointed the foundations of the earth I was by Him as one brought up
   with Him." [568] And Moses, who lived many years before Solomon, or,
   rather, the Word of God by him as by an instrument, says, "In the
   beginning God created the heaven and the earth." First he named the
   "beginning," [569] and "creation," [570] then he thus introduced God;
   for not lightly and on slight occasion is it right to name God. For the
   divine wisdom foreknew that some would trifle and name a multitude of
   gods that do not exist. In order, therefore, that the living God might
   be known by His works, and that [it might be known that] by His Word
   God created the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, he
   said, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." Then
   having spoken of their creation, he explains to us: "And the earth was
   without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and
   the Spirit of God moved upon the water." This, sacred Scripture teaches
   at the outset, to show that matter, from which God made and fashioned
   the world, was in some manner created, being produced by God. [571]

      Chapter XI.--The Six Days' Work Described.

   Now, the beginning of the creation is light; since light manifests the
   things that are created. Wherefore it is said: "And God said, Let light
   be, [572] and light was; and God saw the light, that it was good,"
   manifestly made good for man. "And God divided the light from the
   darkness; and God called the light Day, and the darkness He called
   Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. And God
   said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it
   divide the waters from the waters: and it was so. And God made the
   firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from
   the waters which were above the firmament. And God called the firmament
   Heaven: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning
   were the second day. And God said, Let the water under the heaven be
   gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
   And the waters were gathered together into their places, and the dry
   land appeared. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering
   together of the waters He called Seas: and God saw that it was good.
   And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed
   after his kind and in his likeness, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit
   after his kind, whose seed is in itself, in his likeness: and it was
   so. And the earth brought forth grass, the herb yielding seed after his
   kind, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself,
   after his kind, on the earth: and God saw that it was good. And the
   evening and the morning were the third day. And God said, Let there be
   lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light on earth, to
   divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
   seasons, and for days, and for years; and let them be for lights in the
   firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
   And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and
   the lesser light to rule the night: He made the stars also. And God set
   them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and
   to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from
   the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the
   morning were the fourth day. And God said, Let the waters bring forth
   the creeping things that have life, and fowl flying over the earth in
   the firmament of heaven: and it was so. And God created great whales,
   and every living creature that creepeth, which the waters brought forth
   after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw
   that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Increase and multiply,
   and fill the waters of the sea, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And
   the evening and the morning were the fifth day. And God said, Let the
   earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and
   creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
   And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle
   after their kind, and all the creeping things of the earth. And God
   said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them
   have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
   heaven, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
   creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. And God created man: in
   the image of God created He him; male and female created He them. And
   God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the
   earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
   over the fowl of the heaven, and over all cattle, and over all the
   earth, and over all the creeping things that creep upon the earth. And
   God said, Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is
   upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which is the
   fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat, and to all
   the beasts of the earth, and to all the fowls of heaven, and to every
   creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, which has in it the breath
   of life; every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw
   everything that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the
   evening and the morning were the sixth day. And the heaven and the
   earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the sixth day God
   finished His works which He made, and rested on the seventh day from
   all His works which He made. And God blessed the seventh day, and
   sanctified it; because in it He rested from all His works which God
   began to create."

      Chapter XII.--The Glory of the Six Days' Work.

   Of this six days' work no man can give a worthy explanation and
   description of all its parts, not though he had ten thousand tongues
   and ten thousand mouths; nay, though he were to live ten thousand
   years, sojourning in this life, not even so could he utter anything
   worthy of these things, on account of the exceeding greatness and
   riches of the wisdom of God which there is in the six days' work above
   narrated. Many writers indeed have imitated [the narration], and
   essayed to give an explanation of these things; yet, though they thence
   derived some suggestions, both concerning the creation of the world and
   the nature of man, they have emitted no slightest spark of truth. And
   the utterances of the philosophers, and writers, and poets have an
   appearance of trustworthiness, on account of the beauty of their
   diction; but their discourse is proved to be foolish and idle, because
   the multitude of their nonsensical frivolities is very great; and not a
   stray morsel of truth is found in them. For even if any truth seems to
   have been uttered by them, it has a mixture of error. And as a
   deleterious drug, when mixed with honey or wine, or some other thing,
   makes the whole [mixture] hurtful and profitless; so also eloquence is
   in their case found to be labour in vain; yea, rather an injurious
   thing to those who credit it. Moreover, [they spoke] concerning the
   seventh day, which all men acknowledge; but the most know not that what
   among the Hebrews is called the "Sabbath," is translated into Greek the
   "Seventh" (hebdomas), a name which is adopted by every nation, although
   they know not the reason of the appellation. And as for what the poet
   Hesiod says of Erebus being produced from chaos, as well as the earth
   and love which lords it over his [Hesiod's] gods and men, his dictum is
   shown to be idle and frigid, and quite foreign to the truth. For it is
   not meet that God be conquered by pleasure; since even men of
   temperance abstain from all base pleasure and wicked lust.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XIII.--Remarks on the Creation of the World.

   Moreover, his [Hesiod's] human, and mean, and very weak conception, so
   far as regards God, is discovered in his beginning to relate the
   creation of all things from the earthly things here below. For man,
   being below, begins to build from the earth, and cannot in order make
   the roof, unless he has first laid the foundation. But the power of God
   is shown in this, that, first of all, He creates out of nothing,
   according to His will, the things that are made. "For the things which
   are impossible with men are possible with God." [573] Wherefore, also,
   the prophet mentioned that the creation of the heavens first of all
   took place, as a kind of roof, saying: "At the first God created the
   heavens"--that is, that by means of the "first" principle the heavens
   were made, as we have already shown. And by "earth" he means the ground
   and foundation, as by "the deep" he means the multitude of waters; and
   "darkness" he speaks of, on account of the heaven which God made
   covering the waters and the earth like a lid. And by the Spirit which
   is borne above the waters, he means that which God gave for animating
   the creation, as he gave life to man, [574] mixing what is fine with
   what is fine. For the Spirit is fine, and the water is fine, that the
   Spirit may nourish the water, and the water penetrating everywhere
   along with the Spirit, may nourish creation. For the Spirit being one,
   and holding the place of light, [575] was between the water and the
   heaven, in order that the darkness might not in any way communicate
   with the heaven, which was nearer God, before God said, "Let there be
   light." The heaven, therefore, being like a dome-shaped covering,
   comprehended matter which was like a clod. And so another prophet,
   Isaiah by name, spoke in these words: "It is God who made the heavens
   as a vault, and stretched them as a tent to dwell in." [576] The
   command, then, of God, that is, His Word, shining as a lamp in an
   enclosed chamber, lit up all that was under heaven, when He had made
   light apart from the world. [577] And the light God called Day, and the
   darkness Night. Since man would not have been able to call the light
   Day, or the darkness Night, nor, indeed, to have given names to the
   other things, had not he received the nomenclature from God, who made
   the things themselves. In the very beginning, therefore, of the history
   and genesis of the world, the holy Scripture spoke not concerning this
   firmament [which we see], but concerning another heaven, which is to us
   invisible, after which this heaven which we see has been called
   "firmament," and to which half the water was taken up that it might
   serve for rains, and showers, and dews to mankind. And half the water
   was left on earth for rivers, and fountains, and seas. The water, then,
   covering all the earth, and specially its hollow places, God, through
   His Word, next caused the waters to be collected into one collection,
   and the dry land to become visible, which formerly had been invisible.
   The earth thus becoming visible, was yet without form. God therefore
   formed and adorned it [578] with all kinds of herbs, and seeds and
   plants.

      Chapter XIV.--The World Compared to the Sea.

   Consider, further, their variety, and diverse beauty, and multitude,
   and how through them resurrection is exhibited, for a pattern of the
   resurrection of all men which is to be. For who that considers it will
   not marvel that a fig-tree is produced from a fig-seed, or that very
   huge trees grow from the other very little seeds? And we say that the
   world resembles the sea. For as the sea, if it had not had the influx
   and supply of the rivers and fountains to nourish it, would long since
   have been parched by reason of its saltness; so also the world, if it
   had not had the law of God and the prophets flowing and welling up
   sweetness, and compassion, and righteousness, and the doctrine of the
   holy commandments of God, would long ere now have come to ruin, by
   reason of the wickedness and sin which abound in it. And as in the sea
   there are islands, some of them habitable, and well-watered, and
   fruitful, with havens and harbours in which the storm-tossed may find
   refuge,--so God has given to the world which is driven and
   tempest-tossed by sins, assemblies [579] --we mean holy churches [580]
   --in which survive the doctrines of the truth, as in the
   island-harbours of good anchorage; and into these run those who desire
   to be saved, being lovers of the truth, and wishing to escape the wrath
   and judgment of God. And as, again, there are other islands, rocky and
   without water, and barren, and infested by wild beasts, and
   uninhabitable, and serving only to injure navigators and the
   storm-tossed, on which ships are wrecked, and those driven among them
   perish,--so there are doctrines of error--I mean heresies [581] --which
   destroy those who approach them. For they are not guided by the word of
   truth; but as pirates, when they have filled their vessels, [582] drive
   them on the fore-mentioned places, that they may spoil them: so also it
   happens in the case of those who err from the truth, that they are all
   totally ruined by their error.

      Chapter XV.--Of the Fourth Day.

   On the fourth day the luminaries were made; because God, who possesses
   foreknowledge, knew the follies of the vain philosophers, that they
   were going to say, that the things which grow on the earth are produced
   from the heavenly bodies, so as to exclude God. In order, therefore,
   that the truth might be obvious, the plants and seeds were produced
   prior to the heavenly bodies, for what is posterior cannot produce that
   which is prior. And these contain the pattern and type of a great
   mystery. For the sun is a type of God, and the moon of man. And as the
   sun far surpasses the moon in power and glory, so far does God surpass
   man. And as the sun remains ever full, never becoming less, so does God
   always abide perfect, being full of all power, and understanding, and
   wisdom, and immortality, and all good. But the moon wanes monthly, and
   in a manner dies, being a type of man; then it is born again, and is
   crescent, for a pattern of the future resurrection. In like manner also
   the three days which were before the luminaries, [583] are types of the
   Trinity, [584] of God, and His Word, and His wisdom. [585] And the
   fourth is the type of man, who needs light, that so there may be God,
   the Word, wisdom, man. Wherefore also on the fourth day the lights were
   made. The disposition of the stars, too, contains a type of the
   arrangement and order of the righteous and pious, and of those who keep
   the law and commandments of God. For the brilliant and bright stars are
   an imitation of the prophets, and therefore they remain fixed, not
   declining, nor passing from place to place. And those which hold the
   second place in brightness, are types of the people of the righteous.
   And those, again, which change their position, and flee from place to
   place, which also are called planets, [586] they too are a type of the
   men who have wandered from God, abandoning His law and commandments.

      Chapter XVI.--Of the Fifth Day.

   On the fifth day the living creatures which proceed from the waters
   were produced, through which also is revealed the manifold wisdom of
   God in these things; for who could count their multitude and very
   various kinds? Moreover, the things proceeding from the waters were
   blessed by God, that this also might be a sign of men's being destined
   to receive repentance and remission of sins, through the water and
   laver of regeneration,--as many as come to the truth, and are born
   again, and receive blessing from God. But the monsters of the deep and
   the birds of prey are a similitude of covetous men and transgressors.
   For as the fish and the fowls are of one nature,--some indeed abide in
   their natural state, and do no harm to those weaker than themselves,
   but keep the law of God, and eat of the seeds of the earth; others of
   them, again, transgress the law of God, and eat flesh, and injure those
   weaker than themselves: thus, too, the righteous, keeping the law of
   God, bite and injure none, but live holily and righteously. But
   robbers, and murderers, and godless persons are like monsters of the
   deep, and wild beasts, and birds of prey; for they virtually devour
   those weaker than themselves. The race, then, of fishes and of creeping
   things, though partaking of God's blessing, received no very
   distinguishing property.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XVII.--Of the Sixth Day.

   And on the sixth day, God having made the quadrupeds, and wild beasts,
   and the land reptiles, pronounced no blessing upon them, reserving His
   blessing for man, whom He was about to create on the sixth day. The
   quadrupeds, too, and wild beasts, were made for a type of some men, who
   neither know nor worship God, but mind earthly things, and repent not.
   For those who turn from their iniquities and live righteously, in
   spirit fly upwards like birds, and mind the things that are above, and
   are well-pleasing to the will of God. But those who do not know nor
   worship God, are like birds which have wings, but cannot fly nor soar
   to the high things of God. Thus, too, though such persons are called
   men, yet being pressed down with sins, they mind grovelling and earthly
   things. And the animals are named wild beasts [theria], from their
   being hunted [thereuesthai], not as if they had been made evil or
   venomous from the first--for nothing was made evil by God, [587] but
   all things good, yea, very good,--but the sin in which man was
   concerned brought evil upon them. For when man transgressed, they also
   transgressed with him. For as, if the master of the house himself acts
   rightly, the domestics also of necessity conduct themselves well; but
   if the master sins, the servants also sin with him; so in like manner
   it came to pass, that in the case of man's sin, he being master, all
   that was subject to him sinned with him. When, therefore, man again
   shall have made his way back to his natural condition, and no longer
   does evil, those also shall be restored to their original gentleness.

      Chapter XVIII.--The Creation of Man.

   But as to what relates to the creation of man, his own creation cannot
   be explained by man, though it is a succinct account of it which holy
   Scripture gives. For when God said, "Let Us make man in Our image,
   after Our likeness," He first intimates the dignity of man. For God
   having made all things by His Word, and having reckoned them all mere
   bye-works, reckons the creation of man to be the only work worthy of
   His own hands. Moreover, God is found, as if needing help, to say, "Let
   Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness." But to no one else than
   to His own Word and wisdom did He say, "Let Us make." And when He had
   made and blessed him, that he might increase and replenish the earth,
   He put all things under his dominion, and at his service; and He
   appointed from the first that he should find nutriment from the fruits
   of the earth, and from seeds, and herbs, and acorns, having at the same
   time appointed that the animals be of habits similar to man's, that
   they also might eat of all the seeds of the earth.

      Chapter XIX.--Man is Placed in Paradise.

   God having thus completed the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and
   all that are in them, on the sixth day, rested on the seventh day from
   all His works which He made. Then holy Scripture gives a summary in
   these words: "This is the book of the generation of the heavens and the
   earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord made the
   heavens and the earth, and every green thing of the field, before it
   was made, and every herb of the field before it grew. For God had not
   caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the
   ground." [588] By this He signifies to us, that the whole earth was at
   that time watered by a divine fountain, and had no need that man should
   till it; but the earth produced all things spontaneously by the command
   of God, that man might not be wearied by tilling it. But that the
   creation of man might be made plain, so that there should not seem to
   be an insoluble problem existing among men, since God had said, "Let Us
   make man;" and since His creation was not yet plainly related,
   Scripture teaches us, saying: "And a fountain went up out of the earth,
   and watered the face of the whole earth; and God made man of the dust
   of the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man
   became a living soul." [589] Whence also by most persons the soul is
   called immortal. [590] And after the formation of man, God chose out
   for him a region among the places of the East, excellent for light,
   brilliant with a very bright atmosphere, [abundant] in the finest
   plants; and in this He placed man.

      Chapter XX.--The Scriptural Account of Paradise.

   Scripture thus relates the words of the sacred history: "And God
   planted Paradise, eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He
   had formed. And out of the ground made God to grow every tree that is
   pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
   midst of Paradise, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. And
   a river flows out of Eden, to water the garden; thence it is parted
   into four heads. The name of the first is Pison: that is it which
   compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; and the gold
   of that land is good, and there is bdellium and the onyx stone. And the
   name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the
   whole land of Ethiopia. And the third river is Tigris: this is it which
   goeth toward Syria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. And the Lord God
   took the man whom He had made, and put him in the garden, to till and
   to keep it. And God commanded Adam, saying, Of every tree that is in
   the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of
   good and evil, ye shall not eat of it; for in the day ye eat of it ye
   shall surely die. And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man
   should be alone; let Us make him an helpmeet for him. And out of the
   ground God formed all the beasts of the field, and all the fowls of
   heaven, and brought them to Adam. And whatsoever Adam called every
   living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all
   cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and to all the beasts of the
   field. But for Adam there was not found an helpmeet for him. And God
   caused an ecstasy to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of
   his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib, which
   the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto
   Adam. And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
   flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.
   Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave
   unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. And they were both
   naked, Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed."
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXI.--Of the Fall of Man.

   "Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the
   Lord God had made. And the serpent said to the woman, Why hath God
   said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? And the woman said
   unto the serpent, We eat of every tree of the garden, but of the fruit
   of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God hath said, Ye shall
   not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent
   said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die. For God doth know that in
   the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be
   as gods, knowing good and evil. And the woman saw that the tree was
   good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
   desired to make one wise; and having taken of the fruit thereof, she
   did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her: and they did eat. And
   the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked;
   and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. And
   they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool
   of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of
   the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called
   unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said unto Him, I
   heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked,
   and I hid myself. And He said unto him, Who told thee that thou wast
   naked, unless thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that
   thou shouldest not eat? And Adam said, The woman whom Thou gavest to be
   with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And God said to the
   woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The
   serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And the Lord God said unto the
   serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed above all the
   beasts of the earth; on thy breast and belly shalt thou go, and dust
   shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity between
   thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise
   thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. [591] And to the woman He
   said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy travail: in sorrow
   shalt thou bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy
   husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam He said, Because
   thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the
   tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it;
   cursed is the ground in [592] thy works: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it
   all the days of thy life; thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to
   thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy
   face shalt thou eat thy bread, till thou return unto the earth; for out
   of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
   return." [593] Such is the account given by holy Scripture of the
   history of man and of Paradise.

      Chapter XXII.--Why God is Said to Have Walked.

   You will say, then, to me: "You said that God ought not to be contained
   in a place, and how do you now say that He walked in Paradise?" Hear
   what I say. The God and Father, indeed, of all cannot be contained, and
   is not found in a place, for there is no place of His rest; but His
   Word, through whom He made all things, being His power and His wisdom,
   assuming the person [594] of the Father and Lord of all, went to the
   garden in the person of God, and conversed with Adam. For the divine
   writing itself teaches us that Adam said that he had heard the voice.
   But what else is this voice but the Word of God, who is also His Son?
   Not as the poets and writers of myths talk of the sons of gods begotten
   from intercourse [with women], but as truth expounds, the Word, that
   always exists, residing within the heart of God. For before anything
   came into being He had Him as a counsellor, being His own mind and
   thought. But when God wished to make all that He determined on, He
   begot this Word, uttered, [595] the first-born of all creation, not
   Himself being emptied of the Word [Reason], but having begotten Reason,
   and always conversing with His Reason. And hence the holy writings
   teach us, and all the spirit-bearing [inspired] men, one of whom, John,
   says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God," [596]
   showing that at first God was alone, and the Word in Him. Then he says,
   "The Word was God; all things came into existence through Him; and
   apart from Him not one thing came into existence." The Word, then,
   being God, and being naturally [597] produced from God, whenever the
   Father of the universe wills, He sends Him to any place; and He,
   coming, is both heard and seen, being sent by Him, and is found in a
   place.

   Man, therefore, God made on the sixth day, and made known this creation
   after the seventh day, when also He made Paradise, that he might be in
   a better and distinctly superior place. And that this is true, the fact
   itself proves. For how can one miss seeing that the pains which women
   suffer in childbed, and the oblivion of their labours which they
   afterwards enjoy, are sent in order that the word of God may be
   fulfilled, and that the race of men may increase and multiply? [598]
   And do we not see also the judgment of the serpent,--how hatefully he
   crawls on his belly and eats the dust,--that we may have this, too, for
   a proof of the things which were said aforetime?

      Chapter XXIV.--The Beauty of Paradise.

   God, then, caused to spring out of the earth every tree that is
   beautiful in appearance, or good for food. For at first there were only
   those things which were produced on the third day,--plants, and seeds,
   and herbs; but the things which were in Paradise were made of a
   superior loveliness and beauty, since in it the plants were said to
   have been planted by God. As to the rest of the plants, indeed, the
   world contained plants like them; but the two trees,--the tree of life
   and the tree of knowledge,--the rest of the earth possessed not, but
   only Paradise. And that Paradise is earth, and is planted on the earth,
   the Scripture states, saying: [599] "And the Lord God planted Paradise
   in Eden eastwards, and placed man there; and out of the ground made the
   Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for
   food." By the expressions, therefore, "out of the ground," and
   "eastwards," the holy writing clearly teaches us that Paradise is under
   this heaven, under which the east and the earth are. And the Hebrew
   word Eden signifies "delight." And it was signified that a river flowed
   out of Eden to water Paradise, and after that divides into four heads;
   of which the two called Pison and Gihon water the eastern parts,
   especially Gihon, which encompasses the whole land of Ethiopia, and
   which, they say, reappears in Egypt under the name of Nile. And the
   other two rivers are manifestly recognisable by us--those called Tigris
   and Euphrates--for these border on our own regions. And God having
   placed man in Paradise, as has been said, to till and keep it,
   commanded him to eat of all the trees,--manifestly of the tree of life
   also; but only of the tree of knowledge He commanded him not to taste.
   And God transferred him from the earth, out of which he had been
   produced, into Paradise, giving him means of advancement, in order
   that, maturing and becoming perfect, and being even declared a god, he
   might thus ascend into heaven in possession of immortality. For man had
   been made a middle nature, neither wholly mortal, nor altogether
   immortal, but capable of either; so also the place, Paradise, was made
   in respect of beauty intermediate between earth and heaven. And by the
   expression, "till it," [600] no other kind of labour is implied than
   the observance of God's command, lest, disobeying, he should destroy
   himself, as indeed he did destroy himself, by sin.

      Chapter XXV.--God Was Justified in Forbidding Man to Eat of the Tree of
      Knowledge.

   The tree of knowledge itself was good, and its fruit was good. For it
   was not the tree, as some think, but the disobedience, which had death
   in it. For there was nothing else in the fruit than only knowledge; but
   knowledge is good when one uses it discreetly. [601] But Adam, being
   yet an infant in age, was on this account as yet unable to receive
   knowledge worthily. For now, also, when a child is born it is not at
   once able to eat bread, but is nourished first with milk, and then,
   with the increment of years, it advances to solid food. Thus, too,
   would it have been with Adam; for not as one who grudged him, as some
   suppose, did God command him not to eat of knowledge. But He wished
   also to make proof of him, whether he was submissive to His
   commandment. And at the same time He wished man, infant as he was,
   [602] to remain for some time longer simple and sincere. For this is
   holy, not only with God, but also with men, that in simplicity and
   guilelessness subjection be yielded to parents. But if it is right that
   children be subject to parents, how much more to the God and Father of
   all things? Besides, it is unseemly that children in infancy be wise
   beyond their years; for as in stature one increases in an orderly
   progress, so also in wisdom. But as when a law has commanded abstinence
   from anything, and some one has not obeyed, it is obviously not the law
   which causes punishment, but the disobedience and transgression;--for a
   father sometimes enjoins on his own child abstinence from certain
   things, and when he does not obey the paternal order, he is flogged and
   punished on account of the disobedience; and in this case the actions
   themselves are not the [cause of] stripes, but the disobedience
   procures punishment for him who disobeys;--so also for the first man,
   disobedience procured his expulsion from Paradise. Not, therefore, as
   if there were any evil in the tree of knowledge; but from his
   disobedience did man draw, as from a fountain, labour, pain, grief, and
   at last fall a prey to death.

   time, not physical development. He was but a few days old.]

      Chapter XXVI.--God's Goodness in Expelling Man from Paradise.

   And God showed great kindness to man in this, that He did not suffer
   him to remain in sin for ever; but, as it were, by a kind of
   banishment, cast him out of Paradise, in order that, having by
   punishment expiated, within an appointed time, the sin, and having been
   disciplined, he should afterwards be restored. Wherefore also, when man
   had been formed in this world, it is mystically written in Genesis, as
   if he had been twice placed in Paradise; so that the one was fulfilled
   when he was placed there, and the second will be fulfilled after the
   resurrection and judgment. For just as a vessel, when on being
   fashioned it has some flaw, is remoulded or remade, that it may become
   new and entire; so also it happens to man by death. For somehow or
   other he is broken up, that he may rise in the resurrection whole; I
   mean spotless, and righteous, and immortal. And as to God's calling,
   and saying, Where art thou, Adam? God did this, not as if ignorant of
   this; but, being long-suffering, He gave him an opportunity of
   repentance and confession.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXVII.--The Nature of Man.

   But some one will say to us, Was man made by nature mortal? Certainly
   not. Was he, then, immortal? Neither do we affirm this. But one will
   say, Was he, then, nothing? Not even this hits the mark. He was by
   nature neither mortal nor immortal. For if He had made him immortal
   from the beginning, He would have made him God. Again, if He had made
   him mortal, God would seem to be the cause of his death. Neither, then,
   immortal nor yet mortal did He make him, but, as we have said above,
   capable of both; so that if he should incline to the things of
   immortality, keeping the commandment of God, he should receive as
   reward from Him immortality, and should become God; but if, on the
   other hand, he should turn to the things of death, disobeying God, he
   should himself be the cause of death to himself. For God made man free,
   and with power over himself. [603] That, then, which man brought upon
   himself through carelessness and disobedience, this God now vouchsafes
   to him as a gift through His own philanthropy and pity, when men obey
   Him. [604] For as man, disobeying, drew death upon himself; so, obeying
   the will of God, he who desires is able to procure for himself life
   everlasting. For God has given us a law and holy commandments; and
   every one who keeps these can be saved, and, obtaining the
   resurrection, can inherit incorruption.

      Chapter XXVIII.--Why Eve Was Formed of Adam's Rib.

   And Adam having been cast out of Paradise, in this condition knew Eve
   his wife, whom God had formed into a wife for him out of his rib. And
   this He did, not as if He were unable to make his wife separately, but
   God foreknew that man would call upon a number of gods. And having this
   prescience, and knowing that through the serpent error would introduce
   a number of gods which had no existence,--for there being but one God,
   even then error was striving to disseminate a multitude of gods,
   saying, "Ye shall be as gods;"--lest, then, it should be supposed that
   one God made the man and another the woman, therefore He made them
   both; and God made the woman together with the man, not only that thus
   the mystery of God's sole government might be exhibited, but also that
   their mutual affection might be greater. Therefore said Adam to Eve,
   "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh." And besides, he
   prophesied, saying, "For this cause shall a man leave his father and
   his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one
   flesh;" [605] which also itself has its fulfilment in ourselves. For
   who that marries lawfully does not despise mother and father, and his
   whole family connection, and all his household, cleaving to and
   becoming one with his own wife, fondly preferring her? So that often,
   for the sake of their wives, some submit even to death. This Eve, on
   account of her having been in the beginning deceived by the serpent,
   and become the author of sin, the wicked demon, who also is called
   Satan, who then spoke to her through the serpent, and who works even to
   this day in those men that are possessed by him, invokes as Eve. [606]
   And he is called "demon" and "dragon," on account of his
   [apodedrakenai] revolting from God. For at first he was an angel. And
   concerning his history there is a great deal to be said; wherefore I at
   present omit the relation of it, for I have also given an account of
   him in another place.

      Chapter XXIX.--Cain's Crime.

   When, then, Adam knew Eve his wife, she conceived and bare a son, whose
   name was Cain; and she said, "I have gotten a man from God." And yet
   again she bare a second son, whose name was Abel, "who began to be a
   keeper of sheep, but Cain tilled the ground." [607] Their history
   receives a very full narration, yea, even a detailed explanation: [608]
   wherefore the book itself, which is entitled "The Genesis of the
   World," can more accurately inform those who are anxious to learn their
   story. When, then, Satan saw Adam and his wife not only still living,
   but also begetting children--being carried away with spite because he
   had not succeeded in putting them to death,--when he saw that Abel was
   well-pleasing to God, he wrought upon the heart of his brother called
   Cain, and caused him to kill his brother Abel. And thus did death get a
   beginning in this world, to find its way into every race of man, even
   to this day. But God, being pitiful, and wishing to afford to Cain, as
   to Adam, an opportunity of repentance and confession, said, "Where is
   Abel thy brother?" But Cain answered God contumaciously, saying, "I
   know not; am I my brother's keeper?" God, being thus made angry with
   him, said, "What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood
   crieth to me from the earth, which opened her mouth to receive thy
   brother's blood from thy hand. Groaning and trembling shalt thou be on
   the earth." From that time the earth, through fear, no longer receives
   human blood, [609] no, nor the blood of any animal; by which it appears
   that it is not the cause [of death], but man, who transgressed.

   Cain also himself had a son, whose name was Enoch; and he built a city,

   made a beginning of the building of cities, and this before the flood;
   not as Homer falsely says: [610] --


   "Not yet had men a city built."

   And to Enoch was born a son, by name Gaidad; who begat a son called
   Meel; and Meel begat Mathusala; and Mathusala, Lamech. And Lamech took
   unto him two wives, whose names were Adah and Zillah. At that time
   there was made a beginning of polygamy, and also of music. For Lamech
   had three sons: Jabal, Jubal, Tubal. And Jabal became a keeper of
   cattle, and dwelt in tents; but Jubal is he who made known the psaltery
   and the harp; and Tubal became a smith, a forger in brass and iron. So
   far the seed of Cain is registered; and for the rest, the seed of his
   line has sunk into oblivion, on account of his fratricide of his
   brother. And, in place of Abel, God granted to Eve to conceive and bear
   a son, who was called Seth; from whom the remainder of the human race
   proceeds until now. And to those who desire to be informed regarding
   all generations, it is easy to give explanations by means of the holy
   Scriptures. For, as we have already mentioned, this subject, the order
   of the genealogy of man, has been partly handled by us in another
   discourse, in the first book of The History. [611] And all these things
   the Holy Spirit teaches us, who speaks through Moses and the rest of
   the prophets, so that the writings which belong to us godly people are
   more ancient, yea, and are shown to be more truthful, than all writers
   and poets. But also, concerning music, some have fabled that Apollo was
   the inventor, and others say that Orpheus discovered the art of music
   from the sweet voices of the birds. Their story is shown to be empty
   and vain, for these inventors lived many years after the flood. And
   what relates to Noah, who is called by some Deucalion, has been
   explained by us in the book before mentioned, and which, if you wish
   it, you are at liberty to read.

      Chapter XXXI.--The History After the Flood.

   After the flood was there again a beginning of cities and kings, in the
   following manner:--The first city was Babylon, and Erech, and Accad,
   and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. And their king was called Nebroth
   [Nimrod]. From these came Asshur, from whom also the Assyrians receive
   their name. And Nimrod built the cities Nineveh and Rehoboth, and
   Calah, and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; and Nineveh became a very
   great city. And another son of Shem, the son of Noah, by name Mizraim,
   begat Ludim, and those called Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, and
   Pathrusim, and Casluhim, out of whom came Philistin. Of the three sons
   of Noah, however, and of their death and genealogy, we have given a
   compendious register in the above-mentioned book. But now we will
   mention the remaining facts both concerning cities and kings, and the
   things that happened when there was one speech and one language. Before
   the dividing of the languages these fore-mentioned cities existed. But
   when men were about to be dispersed, they took counsel of their own
   judgment, and not at the instigation of God, to build a city, a tower
   whose top might reach into heaven, that they might make a glorious name
   to themselves. Since, therefore, they had dared, contrary to the will
   of God, to attempt a grand work, God destroyed their city, and
   overthrew their tower. From that time He confounded the languages of
   men, giving to each a different dialect. And similarly did the Sibyl
   speak, when she declared that wrath would come on the world. She
   says:--


   "When are fulfilled the threats of the great God,

   With which He threatened men, when formerly

   In the Assyrian land they built a tower,

   And all were of one speech, and wished to rise

   Even till they climbed unto the starry heaven,

   Then the Immortal raised a mighty wind

   And laid upon them strong necessity;

   For when the wind threw down the mighty tower,

   Then rose among mankind fierce strife and hate.

   One speech was changed to many dialects,

   And earth was filled with divers tribes and kings."

   And so on. These things, then, happened in the land of the Chaldæans.
   And in the land of Canaan there was a city, by name Haran. And in these
   days, Pharaoh, who by the Egyptians was also called Nechaoth, was first
   king of Egypt, and thus the kings followed in succession. [612] And in
   the land of Shinar, among those called Chaldæans, the first king was
   Arioch, and next after him Ellasar, and after him Chedorlaomer, king of
   Elam, and after him Tidal, king of the nations called Assyrians. And
   there were five other cities in the territory of Ham, the son of Noah;
   the first called Sodom, then Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Balah, which
   was also called Zoar. And the names of their kings are these: Bera,
   king of Sodom; Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab, king of Admah;
   Shemeber, king of Zeboiim; Bela, king of Zoar, which is also called
   Kephalac. [613] These served Chedorlaomer, the king of the Assyrians,
   for twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they revolted from
   Chedorlaomer; and thus it came to pass at that time that the four
   Assyrian kings waged war upon the five kings. This was the first
   commencement of making war on the earth; and they destroyed the giants
   Karnaim, and the strong nations that were with them in their city, and
   the Horites of the mountains called Seir, as far as the plain of Paran,
   which is by the wilderness. And at that time there was a righteous king
   called Melchisedek, in the city of Salem, which now is Jerusalem. This
   was the first priest of all priests [614] of the Most High God; and
   from him the above-named city Hierosolyma was called Jerusalem. [615]
   And from his time priests were found in all the earth. And after him
   reigned Abimelech in Gerar; and after him another Abimelech. Then
   reigned Ephron, surnamed the Hittite. Such are the names of the kings
   that were in former times. And the rest of the kings of the Assyrians,
   during an interval of many years, have been passed over in silence
   unrecorded, all writers narrating the events of our recent days. There
   were these kings of Assyria: Tiglath-Pileser, and after him
   Shalmaneser, then Sennacherib; and Adrammelech the Ethiopian, who also
   reigned over Egypt, was his triarch;--though these things, in
   comparison with our books, are quite recent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [612] But the Benedictine editor understands the words to mean, that
   the succeeding kings were in like manner called Pharaoh.

   [613] Theophilus spells some of the names differently from what they
   are given in our text. For Tidal he has Thargal; for Bera, Ballas; for
   Birsha, Barsas; for Shinab, Senaar; for Shemeber, Hymoor. Kephalac is
   taken to be a corruption for Balak, which in the previous sentence is
   inserted by many editors, though it is not in the best mss.

   [614] [St. Paul seems to teach us that the whole story of Melchisedek
   is a "similitude," and that the one Great High Priest of our profession
   appeared to Abraham in that character, as to Joshua in another, the
   "Captain of our salvation" (Heb. vii. 1-3; Josh. v. 13-15). We need a
   carefully digested work on the apparitions of the Word before His
   incarnation, or the theophanies of the Old Testament.]

   [615] [Certainly a striking etymon, "Salem of the priest." But we can
   only accept it as a beautiful play upon words.]

      Chapter XXXII.--How the Human Race Was Dispersed.

   Hence, therefore, may the loves of learning and of antiquity understand
   the history, and see that those things are recent which are told by us
   apart from the holy prophets. [616] For though at first there were few
   men in the land of Arabia and Chaldæa, yet, after their languages were
   divided, they gradually began to multiply and spread over all the
   earth; and some of them tended towards the east to dwell there, and
   others to the parts of the great continent, and others northwards, so
   as to extend as far as Britain, in the Arctic regions. And others went
   to the land of Canaan, which is called Judæa, and Phoenicia, and the
   region of Ethiopia, and Egypt, and Libya, and the country called
   torrid, and the parts stretching towards the west; and the rest went to
   places by the sea, and Pamphylia, and Asia, and Greece, and Macedonia,
   and, besides, to Italy, and the whole country called Gaul, and Spain,
   and Germany; so that now the whole world is thus filled with
   inhabitants. Since then the occupation of the world by men was at first
   in three divisions,--in the east, and south, and west: afterwards, the
   remaining parts of the earth were inhabited, when men became very
   numerous. And the writers, not knowing these things, are forward to
   maintain that the world is shaped like a sphere, and to compare it to a
   cube. But how can they say what is true regarding these things, when
   they do not know about the creation of the world and its population?
   Men gradually increasing in number and multiplying on the earth, as we
   have already said, the islands also of the sea and the rest of the
   countries were inhabited.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [616] Proving the antiquity of Scripture, by showing that no recent
   occurrences are mentioned in it. Wolf, however, gives another reading,
   which would be rendered, "understand whether those things are recent
   which we utter on the authority of the holy prophets."
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXXIII.--Profane History Gives No Account of These Matters.

   Who, then, of those called sages, and poets, and historians, could tell
   us truly of these things, themselves being much later born, and
   introducing a multitude of gods, who were born so many years after the
   cities, and are more modern than kings, and nations, and wars? For they
   should have made mention of all events, even those which happened
   before the flood; both of the creation of the world and the formation
   of man, and the whole succession of events. The Egyptian or Chaldæan
   prophets, and the other writers, should have been able accurately to
   tell, if at least they spoke by a divine and pure spirit, and spoke
   truth in all that was uttered by them; and they should have announced
   not only things past or present, but also those that were to come upon
   the world. And therefore it is proved that all others have been in
   error; and that we Christians alone have possessed the truth, inasmuch
   as we are taught by the Holy Spirit, who spoke in the holy prophets,
   and foretold all things.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXXIV.--The Prophets Enjoined Holiness of Life.

   And, for the rest, would that in a kindly spirit you would investigate
   divine things [617] --I mean the things that are spoken by the
   prophets--in order that, by comparing what is said by us with the
   utterances of the others, you may be able to discover the truth. We
   [618] have shown from their own histories, which they have compiled,
   that the names of those who are called gods, are found to be the names
   of men who lived among them, as we have shown above. And to this day
   their images are daily fashioned, idols, "the works of men's hands."
   And these the mass of foolish men serve, whilst they reject the maker
   and fashioner of all things and the nourisher of all breath of life,
   giving credit to vain doctrines through the deceitfulness of the
   senseless tradition received from their fathers. But God at least, the
   Father and Creator of the universe, did not abandon mankind, but gave a
   law, and sent holy prophets to declare and teach the race of men, that
   each one of us might awake and understand that there is one God. And
   they also taught us to refrain from unlawful idolatry, and adultery,
   and murder, fornication, theft, avarice, false swearing, wrath, and
   every incontinence and uncleanness; and that whatever a man would not
   wish to be done to himself, he should not do to another; and thus he
   who acts righteously shall escape the eternal punishments, and be
   thought worthy of the eternal life from God.

      Chapter XXXV.--Precepts from the Prophetic Books.

   The divine law, then, not only forbids the worshipping of idols, but
   also of the heavenly bodies, the sun, the moon, or the other stars;
   yea, not heaven, nor earth, nor the sea, nor fountains, nor rivers,
   must be worshipped, but we must serve in holiness of heart and
   sincerity of purpose only the living and true God, who also is Maker of
   the universe. Wherefore saith the holy law: "Thou shalt not commit
   adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou
   shalt not desire thy neighbour's wife." So also the prophets. Solomon
   indeed teaches us that we must not sin with so much as a turn of the
   eye, [619] saying, "Let thine eyes look right on, and let thy eyelids
   look straight before thee." [620] And Moses, who himself also was a
   prophet, says, concerning the sole government of God: "Your God is He
   who establishes the heaven, and forms the earth, whose hands have
   brought forth all the host of heaven; and He has not set these things
   before you that you should go after them." [621] And Isaiah himself
   also says: "Thus saith the Lord God who established the heavens, and
   founded the earth and all that is therein, and giveth breath unto the
   people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. This is the Lord
   your God." [622] And again, through him He says: "I have made the
   earth, and man upon it. I by my hand have established the heavens."
   [623] And in another chapter, "This is your God, who created the ends
   of the earth; He hungereth not, neither is weary, and there is no
   searching of His understanding." [624] So, too, Jeremiah says: "Who
   hath made the earth by His power, and established the world by His
   wisdom, and by His discretion hath stretched out the heavens, and a
   mass of water in the heavens, and He caused the clouds to ascend from
   the ends of the earth; He made lightnings with rain, and brought forth
   winds out of His treasures." [625] One can see how consistently and
   harmoniously all the prophets spoke, having given utterance through one
   and the same spirit concerning the unity of God, and the creation of
   the world, and the formation of man. Moreover, they were in sore
   travail, bewailing the godless race of men, and they reproached those,
   who seemed to be wise, for their error and hardness of heart. Jeremiah,
   indeed, said: "Every man is brutishly gone astray from the knowledge of
   Him; every founder is confounded by his graven images; in vain the
   silversmith makes his molten images; there is no breath in them: in the
   day of their visitation they shall perish." [626] The same, too, says
   David: "They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; there is
   none that doeth good, no, not one; they have all gone aside, they have
   together become profitless." [627] So also Habakkuk: "What profiteth
   the graven image that he has graven it a lying image? Woe to him that
   saith to the stone, Awake; and to the wood, Arise." [628] Likewise
   spoke the other prophets of the truth. And why should I recount the
   multitude of prophets, who are numerous, and said ten thousand things
   consistently and harmoniously? For those who desire it, can, by reading
   what they uttered, accurately understand the truth, and no longer be
   carried away by opinion and profitless labour. These, then, whom we
   have already mentioned, were prophets among the Hebrews,--illiterate,
   and shepherds, and uneducated.

      Chapter XXXVI.--Prophecies of the Sibyl.

   And the Sibyl, who was a prophetess among the Greeks and the other
   nations, in the beginning of her prophecy, reproaches the race of men,
   saying:--


   "How are ye still so quickly lifted up,

   And how so thoughtless of the end of life,

   Ye mortal men of flesh, who are but nought?

   Do ye not tremble, nor fear God most high?

   Your Overseer, the Knower, Seer of all,

   Who ever keeps those whom His hand first made,

   Puts His sweet Spirit into all His works,

   And gives Him for a guide to mortal men.

   There is one only uncreated God,

   Who reigns alone, all-powerful, very great,

   From whom is nothing hid. He sees all things,

   Himself unseen by any mortal eye.

   Can mortal man see the immortal God,

   Or fleshly eyes, which shun the noontide beams,

   Look upon Him, who dwells beyond the heavens?

   Worship Him then, the self-existent God,

   The unbegotten Ruler of the world,

   Who only was from everlasting time,

   And shall to everlasting still abide.

   Of evil counsels ye shall reap the fruit,

   Because ye have not honoured the true God,

   Nor offered to Him sacred hecatombs.

   To those who dwell in Hades ye make gifts,

   And unto demons offer sacrifice.

   In madness and in pride ye have your walk;

   And leaving the right way, ye wander wide,

   And lose yourselves in pitfalls and in thorns.

   Why do ye wander thus, O foolish men?

   Cease your vain wanderings in the black, dark night;

   Why follow darkness and perpetual gloom

   When, see, there shines for you the blessed light?

   Lo, He is clear--in Him there is no spot.

   Turn, then, from darkness, and behold the day;

   Be wise, and treasure wisdom in your breasts.

   There is one God who sends the winds and rains,

   The earthquakes, and the lightnings, and the plagues,

   The famines, and the snow-storms, and the ice,

   And all the woes that visit our sad race.

   Nor these alone, but all things else He gives,

   Ruling omnipotent in heaven and earth,

   And self-existent from eternity."

   And regarding those [gods] that are said to have been born, she said:--


   "If all things that are born must also die,

   "God cannot be produced by mortal man.

   But there is only One, the All-Supreme,

   Who made the heavens, with all their starry host,

   The sun and moon; likewise the fruitful earth,

   With all the waves of ocean, and the hills,

   The fountains, and the ever flowing streams;

   He also made the countless multitude

   Of ocean creatures, and He keeps alive

   All creeping things, both of the earth and sea;

   And all the tuneful choir of birds He made,

   Which cleave the air with wings, and with shrill pipe

   Trill forth at morn their tender, clear-voiced song.

   Within the deep glades of the hills He placed

   A savage race of beasts; and unto men

   He made all cattle subject, making man

   The God-formed image, ruler over all,

   And putting in subjection to his sway

   Things many and incomprehensible.

   For who of mortals can know all these things?

   He only knows who made them at the first,

   He the Creator, incorruptible,

   Who dwells in upper air eternally;

   Who proffers to the good most rich rewards,

   And against evil and unrighteous men

   Rouses revenge, and wrath, and bloody wars,

   And pestilence, and many a tearful grief.

   O man exalted vainly--say why thus

   Hast thou so utterly destroyed thyself?

   Have ye no shame worshipping beasts for gods?

   And to believe the gods should steal your beasts,

   Or that they need your vessels--is it not

   Frenzy's most profitless and foolish thought?

   Instead of dwelling in the golden heavens,

   Ye see your gods become the prey of worms,

   And hosts of creatures noisome and unclean.

   O fools! ye worship serpents, dogs, and cats,

   Birds, and the creeping things of earth and sea,

   Images made with hands, statues of stone,

   And heaps of rubbish by the wayside placed.

   All these, and many more vain things, ye serve,

   Worshipping things disgraceful even to name:

   These are the gods who lead vain men astray,

   From whose mouth streams of deadly poison flow.

   But unto Him in whom alone is life,

   Life, and undying, everlasting light;

   Who pours into man's cup of life a joy

   Sweeter than sweetest honey to his taste,--

   Unto Him bow the head, to Him alone,

   And walk in ways of everlasting peace.

   Forsaking Him, ye all have turned aside,

   And, in your raving folly, drained the cup

   Of justice quite unmixed, pure, mastering, strong;

   And ye will not again be sober men,

   Ye will not come unto a sober mind,

   And know your God and King, who looks on all:

   Therefore, upon you burning fire shall come,

   And ever ye shall daily burn in flames,

   Ashamed for ever of your useless gods.

   But those who worship the eternal God,

   They shall inherit everlasting life,

   Inhabiting the blooming realms of bliss,

   And feasting on sweet food from starry heaven."

   That these things are true, and useful, and just, and profitable to all
   men, is obvious. Even the poets have spoken of the punishments of the
   wicked.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXXVII.--The Testimonies of the Poets.

   And that evil-doers must necessarily be punished in proportion to their
   deeds, has already been, as it were, oracularly uttered by some of the
   poets, as a witness both against themselves and against the wicked,
   declaring that they shall be punished. Æschylus said:--


   "He who has done must also suffer."

   And Pindar himself said:--


   "It is fit that suffering follow doing."

   So, too, Euripides:--


   "The deed rejoiced you--suffering endure;

   The taken enemy must needs be pain'd."

   And again:--


   "The foe's pain is the hero's meed."

   And, similarly, Archilochus:--


   "One thing I know, I hold it ever true,

   The evil-doer evil shall endure."

   And that God sees all, and that nothing escapes His notice, but that,
   being long-suffering, He refrains until the time when He is to
   judge--concerning this, too, Dionysius said:--


   "The eye of Justice seeing all,

   Yet seemeth not to see."

   And that God's judgment is to be, and that evils will suddenly overtake
   the wicked,--this, too, Æschylus declared, saying:--


   "Swift-footed is the approach of fate,

   And none can justice violate,

   But feels its stern hand soon or late.

   "'Tis with you, though unheard, unseen;

   You draw night's curtain in between,

   But even sleep affords no screen.

   "'Tis with you if you sleep or wake;

   And if abroad your way you take,

   Its still, stern watch you cannot break.

   "'Twill follow you, or cross your path;

   And even night no virtue hath

   To hide you from th' Avenger's wrath.

   "To show the ill the darkness flees;

   Then, if sin offers joy or ease,

   Oh stop, and think that some one sees!"

   And may we not cite Simonides also?--


   "To men no evil comes unheralded;

   But God with sudden hand transforms all things."

   Euripides again:--


   "The wicked and proud man's prosperity

   Is based on sand: his race abideth not;

   And time proclaims the wickedness of men."

   Once more Euripides:--


   "Not without judgment is the Deity,

   But sees when oaths are struck unrighteously,

   And when from men unwilling they are wrung."

   And Sophocles:--


   "If ills you do, ills also you must bear."

   That God will make inquiry both concerning false swearing and
   concerning every other wickedness, they themselves have well-nigh
   predicted. And concerning the conflagration of the world, they have,
   willingly or unwillingly, spoken in conformity with the prophets,
   though they were much more recent, and stole these things from the law
   and the prophets. The poets corroborate the testimony of the prophets.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXXVIII.--The Teachings of the Greek Poets and Philosophers
      Confirmatory of Those of the Hebrew Prophets.

   But what matters it whether they were before or after them? Certainly
   they did at all events utter things confirmatory of the prophets.
   Concerning the burning up of the world, Malachi the prophet foretold:
   "The day of the Lord cometh as a burning oven, and shall consume all
   the wicked." [629] And Isaiah: "For the wrath of God is as a violent
   hail-storm, and as a rushing mountain torrent." [630] The Sibyl, then,
   and the other prophets, yea, and the poets and philosophers, have
   clearly taught both concerning righteousness, and judgment, and
   punishment; and also concerning providence, that God cares for us, not
   only for the living among us, but also for those that are dead: though,
   indeed, they said this unwillingly, for they were convinced by the
   truth. And among the prophets indeed, Solomon said of the dead, "There
   shall be healing to thy flesh, and care taken of thy bones." [631] And
   the same says David, "The bones which Thou hast broken shall rejoice."
   [632] And in agreement with these sayings was that of Timocles:--


   "The dead are pitied by the loving God."

   And the writers who spoke of a multiplicity of gods came at length to
   the doctrine of the unity of God, and those who asserted chance spoke
   also of providence; and the advocates of impunity confessed there would
   be a judgment, and those who denied that there is a sensation after
   death acknowledged that there is. Homer, accordingly, though he had
   said,--


   "Like fleeting vision passed the soul away," [633]

   says in another place:--


   "To Hades went the disembodied soul;" [634]

   And again:--


   "That I may quickly pass through Hades' gates,

   Me bury." [635]

   And as regards the others whom you have read, I think you know with
   sufficient accuracy how they have expressed themselves. But all these
   things will every one understand who seeks the wisdom of God, and is
   well pleasing to Him through faith and righteousness and the doing of
   good works. For one of the prophets whom we already mentioned, Hosea by
   name, said, "Who is wise, and he shall understand these things?
   prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right,
   and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall
   therein." [636] He, then, who is desirous of learning, should learn
   much. [637] Endeavour therefore to meet [with me] more frequently,
   that, by hearing the living voice, you may accurately ascertain the
   truth.

   philomuthein instead of philomathein: "He who desires to learn should
   also desire to discuss subjects, and hold conversations on them." In
   this case, Theophilus most probably borrows his remark from Aristotle,
   Metaphysic. i. c. 2.

      Chapter I.--Autolycus Not Yet Convinced.

   Theophilus to Autolycus, greeting: Seeing that writers are fond of
   composing a multitude of books for vainglory,--some concerning gods,
   and wars, and chronology, and some, too, concerning useless legends,
   and other such labour in vain, in which you also have been used to
   employ yourself until now, and do not grudge to endure that toil; but
   though you conversed with me, are still of opinion that the word of
   truth is an idle tale, and suppose that our writings are recent and
   modern;--on this account I also will not grudge the labour of
   compendiously setting forth to you, God helping me, the antiquity of
   our books, reminding you of it in few words, that you may not grudge
   the labour of reading it, but may recognise the folly of the other
   authors.

      Chapter II.--Profane Authors Had No Means of Knowing the Truth.

   For it was fit that they who wrote should themselves have been
   eye-witnesses of those things concerning which they made assertions, or
   should accurately have ascertained them from those who had seen them;
   for they who write of things unascertained beat the air. For what did
   it profit Homer to have composed the Trojan war, and to have deceived
   many; or Hesiod, the register of the theogony of those whom he calls
   gods; or Orpheus, the three hundred and sixty-five gods, whom in the
   end of his life he rejects, maintaining in his precepts that there is
   one God? What profit did the sphærography of the world's circle confer
   on Aratus, or those who held the same doctrine as he, except glory
   among men? And not even that did they reap as they deserved. And what
   truth did they utter? Or what good did their tragedies do to Euripides
   and Sophocles, or the other tragedians? Or their comedies to Menander
   and Aristophanes, and the other comedians? Or their histories to
   Herodotus and Thucydides? Or the shrines [638] and the pillars of
   Hercules to Pythagoras, or the Cynic philosophy to Diogenes? What good
   did it do Epicurus to maintain that there is no providence; or
   Empedocles to teach atheism; or Socrates to swear by the dog, and the
   goose, and the plane-tree, and Æsculapius struck by lightning, and the
   demons whom he invoked? And why did he willingly die? What reward, or
   of what kind, did he expect to receive after death? What did Plato's
   system of culture profit him? Or what benefit did the rest of the
   philosophers derive from their doctrines, not to enumerate the whole of
   them, since they are numerous? But these things we say, for the purpose
   of exhibiting their useless and godless opinions.

      Chapter III.--Their Contradictions.

   For all these, having fallen in love with vain and empty reputation,
   neither themselves knew the truth, nor guided others to the truth: for
   the things which they said themselves convict them of speaking
   inconsistently; and most of them demolished their own doctrines. For
   not only did they refute one another, but some, too, even stultified
   their own teachings; so that their reputation has issued in shame and
   folly, for they are condemned by men of understanding. For either they
   made assertions concerning the gods, and afterwards taught that there
   was no god; or if they spoke even of the creation of the world, they
   finally said that all things were produced spontaneously. Yea, and even
   speaking of providence, they taught again that the world was not ruled
   by providence. But what? Did they not, when they essayed to write even
   of honourable conduct, teach the perpetration of lasciviousness, and
   fornication, and adultery; and did they not introduce hateful and
   unutterable wickedness? And they proclaim that their gods took the lead
   in committing unutterable acts of adultery, and in monstrous banquets.
   For who does not sing Saturn devouring his own children, and Jove his
   son gulping down Metis, and preparing for the gods a horrible feast, at
   which also they say that Vulcan, a lame blacksmith, did the waiting;
   and how Jove not only married Juno, his own sister, but also with foul
   mouth did abominable wickedness? And the rest of his deeds, as many as
   the poets sing, it is likely you are acquainted with. Why need I
   further recount the deeds of Neptune and Apollo, or Bacchus and
   Hercules, of the bosom-loving Minerva, and the shameless Venus, since
   in another place [639] we have given a more accurate account of these?

      Chapter IV.--How Autolycus Had Been Misled by False Accusations Against
      the Christians.

   Nor indeed was there any necessity for my refuting these, except that I
   see you still in dubiety about the word of the truth. For though
   yourself prudent, you endure fools gladly. Otherwise you would not have
   been moved by senseless men to yield yourself to empty words, and to
   give credit to the prevalent rumor wherewith godless lips falsely
   accuse us, who are worshippers of God, and are called Christians,
   alleging that the wives of us all are held in common and made
   promiscuous use of; and that we even commit incest with our own
   sisters, and, what is most impious and barbarous of all, that we eat
   human flesh. [640] But further, they say that our doctrine has but
   recently come to light, and that we have nothing to allege in proof of
   what we receive as truth, nor of our teaching, but that our doctrine is
   foolishness. I wonder, then, chiefly that you, who in other matters are
   studious, and a scrutinizer of all things, give but a careless hearing
   to us. For, if it were possible for you, you would not grudge to spend
   the night in the libraries.

   primitive doctrine, that the bread and wine cease to exist in the
   Eucharist, and are changed into natural flesh and blood, our author
   could not have resented this charge as "most barbarous and impious."]

      Chapter V.--Philosophers Inculcate Cannibalism.

   Since, then, you have read much, what is your opinion of the precepts
   of Zeno, and Diogenes, and Cleanthes, which their books contain,
   inculcating the eating of human flesh: that fathers be cooked and eaten
   by their own children; and that if any one refuse or reject a part of
   this infamous food, he himself be devoured who will not eat? An
   utterance even more godless than these is found,--that, namely, of
   Diogenes, who teaches children to bring their own parents in sacrifice,
   and devour them. And does not the historian Herodotus narrate that
   Cambyses, [641] when he had slaughtered the children of Harpagus,
   cooked them also, and set them as a meal before their father? And,
   still further, he narrates that among the Indians the parents are eaten
   by their own children. Oh! the godless teaching of those who recorded,
   yea, rather, inculcated such things! Oh! their wickedness and
   godlessness! Oh! the conception of those who thus accurately
   philosophized, and profess philosophy! For they who taught these
   doctrines have filled the world with iniquity.

      Chapter VI.--Other Opinions of the Philosophers.

   And regarding lawless conduct, those who have blindly wandered into the
   choir of philosophy have, almost to a man, spoken with one voice.
   Certainly Plato, to mention him first who seems to have been the most
   respectable philosopher among them, expressly, as it were, legislates
   in his first book, [642] entitled The Republic, that the wives of all
   be common, using the precedent of the son [643] of Jupiter and the
   lawgiver of the Cretans, in order that under this pretext there might
   be an abundant offspring from the best persons, and that those who were
   worn with toil might be comforted by such intercourse. [644] And
   Epicurus himself, too, as well as teaching atheism, teaches along with
   it incest with mothers and sisters, and this in transgression of the
   laws which forbid it; for Solon distinctly legislated regarding this,
   in order that from a married parent children might lawfully spring,
   that they might not be born of adultery, so that no one should honour
   as his father him who was not his father, or dishonour him who was
   really his father, through ignorance that he was so. And these things
   the other laws of the Romans and Greeks also prohibit. Why, then, do
   Epicurus and the Stoics teach incest and sodomy, with which doctrines
   they have filled libraries, so that from boyhood [645] this lawless
   intercourse is learned? And why should I further spend time on them,
   since even of those they call gods they relate similar things?

   [644] As this sentence cannot be intelligibly rendered without its
   original in Plato, we subjoin the latter: "As for those youths who
   excel either in war or other pursuits, they ought both to have other
   rewards and prizes given them; and specially this, of being allowed the
   freest intercourse with women, that, at the same time, under this
   pretext the greatest number of children may spring from such parents."

   [645] [This statement reflects light upon some passages of Hermas, and
   shows with what delicacy he has reproved the gross vices with which
   Christians could not escape familiarity.]
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter VII.--Varying Doctrine Concerning the Gods.

   For after they had said that these are gods, they again made them of no
   account. For some said that they were composed of atoms; and others,
   again, that they eventuate in atoms; and they say that the gods have no
   more power than men. Plato, too, though he says these are gods, would
   have them composed of matter. And Pythagoras, after he had made such a
   toil and moil about the gods, and travelled up and down [for
   information], at last determines that all things are produced naturally
   and spontaneously, and that the gods care nothing for men. And how many
   atheistic opinions Clitomachus the academician introduced, [I need not
   recount.] And did not Critias and Protagoras of Abdera say, "For
   whether the gods exist, I am not able to affirm concerning them, nor to
   explain of what nature they are; for there are many things would
   prevent me"? And to speak of the opinions of the most atheistical,
   Euhemerus, is superfluous. For having made many daring assertions
   concerning the gods, he at last would absolutely deny their existence,
   and have all things to be governed by self-regulated action. [646] And
   Plato, who spoke so much of the unity of God and of the soul of man,
   asserting that the soul is immortal, is not he himself afterwards
   found, inconsistently with himself, to maintain that some souls pass
   into other men, and that others take their departure into irrational
   animals? How can his doctrine fail to seem dreadful and monstrous--to
   those at least who have any judgment--that he who was once a man shall
   afterwards be a wolf, or a dog, or an ass, or some other irrational
   brute? Pythagoras, too, is found venting similar nonsense, besides his
   demolishing providence. Which of them, then, shall we believe?
   Philemon, the comic poet, who says,--


   "Good hope have they who praise and serve the gods;"

   or those whom we have mentioned--Euhemerus, and Epicurus, and
   Pythagoras, and the others who deny that the gods are to be worshipped,
   and who abolish providence? Concerning God and providence, Ariston
   said:--


   "Be of good courage: God will still preserve

   And greatly help all those who so deserve.

   If no promotion waits on faithful men,

   Say what advantage goodness offers then.

   'Tis granted--yet I often see the just

   Faring but ill, from ev'ry honour thrust;

   While they whose own advancement is their aim,

   Oft in this present life have all they claim.

   But we must look beyond, and wait the end,

   That consummation to which all things tend.

   'Tis not, as vain and wicked men have said,

   By an unbridled destiny we're led:

   It is not blinded chance that rules the world,

   Nor uncontrolled are all things onward hurled.

   The wicked blinds himself with this belief;

   But be ye sure, of all rewards, the chief

   Is still reserved for those who holy live;

   And Providence to wicked men will give

   Only the just reward which is their meed,

   And fitting punishment for each bad deed."

   And one can see how inconsistent with each other are the things which
   others, and indeed almost the majority, have said about God and
   providence. For some have absolutely cancelled God and providence; and
   others, again, have affirmed God, and have avowed that all things are
   governed by providence. The intelligent hearer and reader must
   therefore give minute attention to their expressions; as also Simylus
   said: "It is the custom of the poets to name by a common designation
   the surpassingly wicked and the excellent; we therefore must
   discriminate." As also Philemon says: "A senseless man who sits and
   merely hears is a troublesome feature; for he does not blame himself,
   so foolish is he." We must then give attention, and consider what is
   said, critically inquiring into what has been uttered by the
   philosophers and the poets.

      Chapter VIII.--Wickedness Attributed to the Gods by Heathen Writers.

   For, denying that there are gods, they again acknowledge their
   existence, and they said they committed grossly wicked deeds. And,
   first, of Jove the poets euphoniously sing the wicked actions. And
   Chrysippus, who talked a deal of nonsense, is he not found publishing
   that Juno had the foulest intercourse with Jupiter? For why should I
   recount the impurities of the so-called mother of the gods, or of
   Jupiter Latiaris thirsting for human blood, or the castrated Attis; or
   of Jupiter, surnamed Tragedian, and how he defiled himself, as they
   say, and now is worshipped among the Romans as a god? I am silent about
   the temples of Antinous, and of the others whom you call gods. For when
   related to sensible persons, they excite laughter. They who elaborated
   such a philosophy regarding either the non-existence of God, or
   promiscuous intercourse and beastly concubinage, are themselves
   condemned by their own teachings. Moreover, we find from the writings
   they composed that the eating of human flesh was received among them;
   and they record that those whom they honour as gods were the first to
   do these things.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter IX.--Christian Doctrine of God and His Law.

   Now we also confess that God exists, but that He is one, the creator,
   and maker, and fashioner of this universe; and we know that all things
   are arranged by His providence, but by Him alone. And we have learned a
   holy law; but we have as lawgiver Him who is really God, who teaches us
   to act righteously, and to be pious, and to do good. And concerning
   piety [647] He says, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou
   shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything
   that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in
   the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor
   serve them: for I am the Lord thy God." [648] And of doing good He
   said: "Honour thy father and thy mother; that it may be well with thee,
   and that thy days may be long in the land which I the Lord God give
   thee." Again, concerning righteousness: "Thou shalt not commit
   adultery. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not
   bear false witness against thy neighbour. Thou shalt not covet thy
   neighbour's wife, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, nor his
   land, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his
   beast of burden, nor any of his cattle, nor anything that is thy
   neighbour's. Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of the poor in his
   cause. [649] From every unjust matter keep thee far. The innocent and
   righteous thou shalt not slay; thou shalt not justify the wicked; and
   thou shalt not take a gift, for gifts blind the eyes of them that see
   and pervert righteous words." Of this divine law, then, Moses, who also
   was God's servant, was made the minister both to all the world, and
   chiefly to the Hebrews, who were also called Jews, whom an Egyptian
   king had in ancient days enslaved, and who were the righteous seed of
   godly and holy men--Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. God, being mindful
   of them, and doing marvellous and strange miracles by the hand of
   Moses, delivered them, and led them out of Egypt, leading them through
   what is called the desert; whom He also settled again in the land of
   Canaan, which afterwards was called judæa, and gave them a law, and
   taught them these things. Of this great and wonderful law, which tends
   to all righteousness, the ten heads are such as we have already
   rehearsed.

      Chapter X.--Of Humanity to Strangers.

   Since therefore they were strangers in the land of Egypt, being by
   birth Hebrews from the land of Chaldæa,--for at that time, there being
   a famine, they were obliged to migrate to Egypt for the sake of buying
   food there, where also for a time they sojourned; and these things
   befell them in accordance with a prediction of God,--having sojourned,
   then, in Egypt for 430 years, when Moses was about to lead them out
   into the desert, God taught them by the law, saying, "Ye shall not
   afflict a stranger; for ye know the heart of a stranger: for yourselves
   were strangers in the land of Egypt." [650]

      Chapter XI.--Of Repentance.

   And when the people transgressed the law which had been given to them
   by God, God being good and pitiful, unwilling to destroy them, in
   addition to His giving them the law, afterwards sent forth also
   prophets to them from among their brethren, to teach and remind them of
   the contents of the law, and to turn them to repentance, that they
   might sin no more. But if they persisted in their wicked deeds, He
   forewarned them that they should be delivered into subjection to all
   the kingdoms of the earth; and that this has already happened them is
   manifest. Concerning repentance, then, Isaiah the prophet, generally
   indeed to all, but expressly to the people, says: "Seek ye the Lord
   while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near: let the
   wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let
   him return unto the Lord his God, and he will find mercy, for He will
   abundantly pardon." [651] And another prophet, Ezekiel, says: "If the
   wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all
   My statutes, and do that which is right in My sight, he shall surely
   live, he shall not die. All his transgressions that he hath committed,
   they shall not be mentioned unto him; but in his righteousness that he
   hath done he shall live: for I desire not the death of the sinner,
   saith the Lord, but that he turn from his wicked way, and live." [652]
   Again Isaiah: "Ye who take deep and wicked counsel, turn ye, that ye
   may be saved." [653] And another prophet, Jeremiah: "Turn to the Lord
   your God, as a grape-gatherer to his basket, and ye shall find mercy."
   [654] Many therefore, yea rather, countless are the sayings in the Holy
   Scriptures regarding repentance, God being always desirous that the
   race of men turn from all their sins.

      Chapter XII.--Of Righteousness.

   Moreover, concerning the righteousness which the law enjoined,
   confirmatory utterances are found both with the prophets and in the
   Gospels, because they all spoke inspired by one Spirit of God. Isaiah
   accordingly spoke thus: "Put away the evil of your doings from your
   souls; learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
   the fatherless, plead for the widow." [655] And again the same prophet
   said: "Loose every band of wickedness, dissolve every oppressive
   contract, let the oppressed go free, and tear up every unrighteous
   bond. Deal out thy bread to the hungry, and bring the houseless poor to
   thy home. When thou seest the naked, cover him, and hide not thyself
   from thine own flesh. Then shall thy light break forth as the morning,
   and thine health shall spring forth speedily, and thy righteousness
   shall go before thee." [656] In like manner also Jeremiah says: "Stand
   in the ways, and see, and ask which is the good way of the Lord your
   God, and walk in it and ye shall find rest for your souls. Judge just
   judgment, for in this is the will of the Lord your God." [657] So also
   says Hosea: "Keep judgment, and draw near to your God, who established
   the heavens and created the earth." [658] And another, Joel, spoke in
   agreement with these: "Gather the people, sanctify the congregation,
   assemble the elders, gather the children that are in arms; let the
   bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet,
   and pray to the Lord thy God urgently that he may have mercy upon you,
   and blot out your sins." [659] In like manner also another, Zachariah:
   "Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Execute true judgment, and show mercy
   and compassion every man to his brother; and oppress not the widow, nor
   the fatherless, nor the stranger; and let none of you imagine evil
   against his brother in your heart, saith the Lord Almighty." [660]

      Chapter XIII.--Of Chastity.

   And concerning chastity, the holy word teaches us not only not to sin
   in act, but not even in thought, not even in the heart to think of any
   evil, nor look on another man's wife with our eyes to lust after her.
   Solomon, accordingly, who was a king and a prophet, said: "Let thine
   eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee:
   make straight paths for your feet." [661] And the voice of the Gospel
   teaches still more urgently concerning chastity, saying: "Whosoever
   looketh on a woman who is not his own wife, to lust after her, hath
   committed adultery with her already in his heart." [662] "And he that
   marrieth," says [the Gospel], "her that is divorced from her husband,
   committeth adultery; and whosoever putteth away his wife, saving for
   the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery." [663]
   Because Solomon says: "Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his
   clothes not be burned? Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not
   be burned? So he that goeth in to a married woman shall not be
   innocent." [664]

      Chapter XIV.--Of Loving Our Enemies.

   And that we should be kindly disposed, not only towards those of our
   own stock, as some suppose, Isaiah the prophet said: "Say to those that
   hate you, and that cast you out, Ye are our brethren, that the name of
   the Lord may be glorified, and be apparent in their joy." [665] And the
   Gospel says: "Love your enemies, and pray for them that despitefully
   use you. For if ye love them who love you, what reward have ye? This do
   also the robbers and the publicans." [666] And those that do good it
   teaches not to boast, lest they become men-pleasers. For it says: "Let
   not your left hand know what your right hand doeth." [667] Moreover,
   concerning subjection to authorities and powers, and prayer for them,
   the divine word gives us instructions, in order that "we may lead a
   quiet and peaceable life." [668] And it teaches us to render all things
   to all, [669] "honour to whom honour, fear to whom fear, tribute to
   whom tribute; to owe no man anything, but to love all."

      Chapter XV.--The Innocence of the Christians Defended.

   Consider, therefore, whether those who teach such things can possibly
   live indifferently, and be commingled in unlawful intercourse, or, most
   impious of all, eat human flesh, especially when we are forbidden so
   much as to witness shows of gladiators, lest we become partakers and
   abettors of murders. But neither may we see the other spectacles, [670]
   lest our eyes and ears be defiled, participating in the utterances
   there sung. For if one should speak of cannibalism, in these spectacles
   the children of Thyestes and Tereus are eaten; and as for adultery,
   both in the case of men and of gods, whom they celebrate in elegant
   language for honours and prizes, this is made the subject of their
   dramas. But far be it from Christians to conceive any such deeds; for
   with them temperance dwells, self-restraint is practiced, monogamy is
   observed, chastity is guarded, iniquity exterminated, sin extirpated,
   righteousness exercised, law administered, worship performed, God
   acknowledged: truth governs, grace guards, peace screens them; the holy
   word guides, wisdom teaches, life directs, God reigns. Therefore,
   though we have much to say regarding our manner of life, and the
   ordinances of God, the maker of all creation, we yet consider that we
   have for the present reminded you of enough to induce you to study
   these things, especially since you can now read [our writings] for
   yourself, that as you have been fond of acquiring information, you may
   still be studious in this direction also.

      Chapter XVI.--Uncertain Conjectures of the Philosophers.

   But I wish now to give you a more accurate demonstration, God helping
   me, of the historical periods, that you may see that our doctrine is
   not modern nor fabulous, but more ancient and true than all poets and
   authors who have written in uncertainty. For some, maintaining that the
   world was uncreated, went into infinity; [671] and others, asserting
   that it was created, said that already 153,075 years had passed. This
   is stated by Apollonius the Egyptian. And Plato, who is esteemed to
   have been the wisest of the Greeks, into what nonsense did he run? For
   in his book entitled The Republic, [672] we find him expressly saying:
   "For if things had in all time remained in their present arrangement,
   when ever could any new thing be discovered? For ten thousand times ten
   thousand years elapsed without record, and one thousand or twice as
   many years have gone by since some things were discovered by Dædalus,
   and some by Orpheus, and some by Palamedes." And when he says that
   these things happened, he implies that ten thousand times ten thousand
   years elapsed from the flood to Dædalus. And after he has said a great
   deal about the cities of the world, and the settlements, and the
   nations, he owns that he has said these things conjecturally. For he
   says, "If then, my friend, some god should promise us, that if we
   attempted to make a survey of legislation, the things now said," [673]
   etc., which shows that he was speaking by guess; and if by guess, then
   what he says is not true.

   Theophilus argues that what he said without this assistance he felt to
   be unsafe.

      Chapter XVII.--Accurate Information of the Christians.

   It behoved, therefore, that he should the rather become a scholar of
   God in this matter of legislation, as he himself confessed that in no
   other way could he gain accurate information than by God's teaching him
   through the law. And did not the poets Homer and Hesiod and Orpheus
   profess that they themselves had been instructed by Divine Providence?
   Moreover, it is said that among your writers there were prophets and
   prognosticators, and that those wrote accurately who were informed by
   them. How much more, then, shall we know the truth who are instructed
   by the holy prophets, who were possessed by [674] the Holy Spirit of
   God! On this account all the prophets spoke harmoniously and in
   agreement with one another, and foretold the things that would come to
   pass in all the world. For the very accomplishment of predicted and
   already consummated events should demonstrate to those who are fond of
   information, yea rather, who are lovers of truth, that those things are
   really true which they declared concerning the epochs and eras before
   the deluge: [675] to wit, how the years have run on since the world was
   created until now, so as to manifest the ridiculous mendacity of your
   authors, and show that their statements are not true.

      Chapter XVIII.--Errors of the Greeks About the Deluge.

   For Plato, as we said above, when he had demonstrated that a deluge had
   happened, said that it extended not over the whole earth, but only over
   the plains, and that those who fled to the highest hills saved
   themselves. But others say that there existed Deucalion and Pyrrha, and
   that they were preserved in a chest; and that Deucalion, after he came
   out of the chest, flung stones behind him, and that men were produced
   from the stones; from which circumstance they say that men in the mass
   are named "people." [676] Others, again, say that Clymenus existed in a
   second flood. From what has already been said, it is evident that they
   who wrote such things and philosophized to so little purpose are
   miserable, and very profane and senseless persons. But Moses, our
   prophet and the servant of God, in giving an account of the genesis of
   the world, related in what manner the flood came upon the earth,
   telling us, besides, how the details of the flood came about, and
   relating no fable of Pyrrha nor of Deucalion or Clymenus; nor,
   forsooth, that only the plains were submerged, and that those only who
   escaped to the mountains were saved.

      Chapter XIX.--Accurate Account of the Deluge.

   And neither does he make out that there was a second flood: on the
   contrary, he said that never again would there be a flood of water on
   the world; as neither indeed has there been, nor ever shall be. And he
   says that eight human beings were preserved in the ark, in that which
   had been prepared by God's direction, not by Deucalion, but by Noah;
   which Hebrew word means in English [677] "rest," as we have elsewhere
   shown that Noah, when he announced to the men then alive that there was
   a flood coming, prophesied to them, saying, Come thither, God calls you
   to repentance. On this account he was fitly called Deucalion. [678] And
   this Noah had three sons (as we mentioned in the second book), whose
   names were Shem, and Ham, and Japhet; and these had three wives, one
   wife each; each man and his wife. This man some have surnamed Eunuchus.
   All the eight persons, therefore, who were found in the ark were
   preserved. And Moses showed that the flood lasted forty days and forty
   nights, torrents pouring from heaven, and from the fountains of the
   deep breaking up, so that the water overtopped every high hill 15
   cubits. And thus the race of all the men that then were was destroyed,
   and those only who were protected in the ark were saved; and these, we
   have already said, were eight. And of the ark, the remains are to this
   day to be seen in the Arabian mountains. This, then, is in sum the
   history of the deluge.

      Chapter XX.--Antiquity of Moses.

   And Moses, becoming the leader of the Jews, as we have already stated,
   was expelled from the land of Egypt by the king, Pharaoh, whose name
   was Amasis, and who, they say, reigned after the expulsion of the
   people 25 years and 4 months, as Manetho assumes. And after him
   [reigned] Chebron, 13 years. And after him Amenophis, 20 years 7
   months. And after him his sister Amessa, 21 years 1 month. And after
   her Mephres, 12 years 9 months. And after him Methramuthosis, 20 years
   and 10 months. And after him Tythmoses, 9 years 8 months. And after him
   Damphenophis, 30 years 10 months. And after him Orus, 35 years 5
   months. And after him his daughter, 10 years 3 months. After her
   Mercheres, 12 years 3 months. And after him his son Armais, 30 years 1
   month. After him Messes, son of Miammus, 6 years, 2 months. After him
   Rameses, 1 year 4 months. After him Amenophis, 19 years 6 months. After
   him his sons Thoessus and Rameses, 10 years, who, it is said, had a
   large cavalry force and naval equipment. The Hebrews, indeed, after
   their own separate history, having at that time migrated into the land
   of Egypt, and been enslaved by the king Tethmosis, as already said,
   built for him strong cities, Peitho, and Rameses, and On, which is
   Heliopolis; so that the Hebrews, who also are our ancestors, and from
   whom we have those sacred books which are older than all authors, as
   already said, are proved to be more ancient than the cities which were
   at that time renowned among the Egyptians. And the country was called
   Egypt from the king Sethos. For the word Sethos, they say, is
   pronounced "Egypt." [679] And Sethos had a brother, by name Armais. He
   is called Danaus, the same who passed from Egypt to Argos, whom the
   other authors mention as being of very ancient date.

      Chapter XXI.--Of Manetho's Inaccuracy.

   And Manetho, who among the Egyptians gave out a great deal of nonsense,
   and even impiously charged Moses and the Hebrews who accompanied him
   with being banished from Egypt on account of leprosy, could give no
   accurate chronological statement. For when he said they were shepherds,
   and enemies of the Egyptians, he uttered truth indeed, because he was
   forced to do so. For our forefathers who sojourned in Egypt were truly
   shepherds, but not lepers. For when they came into the land called
   Jerusalem, where also they afterwards abode, it is well known how their
   priests, in pursuance of the appointment of God, continued in the
   temple, and there healed every disease, so that they cured lepers and
   every unsoundness. The temple was built by Solomon the king of Judæa.
   And from Manetho's own statement his chronological error is manifest.
   (As it is also in respect of the king who expelled them, Pharaoh by
   name. For he no longer ruled them. For having pursued the Hebrews, he
   and his army were engulphed in the Red Sea. And he is in error still
   further, in saying that the shepherds made war against the Egyptians.)
   For they went out of Egypt, and thenceforth dwelt in the country now
   called Judæa, 313 [680] years before Danaus came to Argos. And that
   most people consider him older than any other of the Greeks is
   manifest. So that Manetho has unwillingly declared to us, by his own
   writings, two particulars of the truth: first, avowing that they were
   shepherds; secondly, saying that they went out of the land of Egypt. So
   that even from these writings Moses and his followers are proved to be
   900 or even 1000 years prior to the Trojan war. [681]

   [680] The Benedictine editor shows that this should be 393 years.

   [681] The correct date would be about 400 years.

      Chapter XXII.--Antiquity of the Temple.

   Then concerning the building of the temple in Judæa, which Solomon the
   king built 566 years after the exodus of the Jews from Egypt, there is
   among the Tyrians a record how the temple was built; and in their
   archives writings have been preserved, in which the temple is proved to
   have existed 143 [682] years 8 months before the Tyrians founded
   Carthage (and this record was made by Hiram [683] [that is the name of
   the king of the Tyrians), the son of Abimalus, on account of the
   hereditary friendship which existed between Hiram and Solomon, and at
   the same time on account of the surpassing wisdom possessed by Solomon.
   For they continually engaged with each other in discussing difficult
   problems. And proof of this exists in their correspondence, which to
   this day is preserved among the Tyrians, and the writings that passed
   between them); as Menander the Ephesian, while narrating the history of
   the Tyrian kingdom, records, speaking thus: "For when Abimalus the king
   of the Tyrians died, his son Hiram succeeded to the kingdom. He lived
   53 years. And Bazorus succeeded him, who lived 43, and reigned 17
   years. And after him followed Methuastartus, who lived 54 years, and
   reigned 12. And after him succeeded his brother Atharymus, who lived 58
   years, and reigned 9. He was slain by his brother of the name of
   Helles, who lived 50 years, and reigned 8 months. He was killed by
   Juthobalus, priest of Astarte, who lived 40 years, and reigned 12. He
   was succeeded by his son Bazorus, who lived 45 years, and reigned 7.
   And to him his son Metten succeeded, who lived 32 years, and reigned
   29. Pygmalion, son of Pygmalius succeeded him, who lived 56 years, and
   reigned 7. [684] And in the 7th year of his reign, his sister, fleeing
   to Libya, built the city which to this day is called Carthage." The
   whole period, therefore, from the reign of Hiram to the founding of
   Carthage, amounts to 155 years and 8 months. And in the 12th year of
   the reign of Hiram the temple in Jerusalem was built. So that the
   entire time from the building of the temple to the founding of Carthage
   was 143 years and 8 months.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [682] Others read 134 years.

   [684] In this register it seems that the number of years during which
   each person lived does not include the years of his reign.

      Chapter XXIII.--Prophets More Ancient Than Greek Writers.

   So then let what has been said suffice for the testimony of the
   Phoenicians and Egyptians, and for the account of our chronology given
   by the writers Manetho the Egyptian, and Menander the Ephesian, and
   also Josephus, who wrote the Jewish war, which they waged with the
   Romans. For from these very old records it is proved that the writings
   of the rest are more recent than the writings given to us through
   Moses, yes, and than the subsequent prophets. For the last of the
   prophets, who was called Zechariah, was contemporary with the reign of
   Darius. But even the lawgivers themselves are all found to have
   legislated subsequently to that period. For if one were to mention
   Solon the Athenian, he lived in the days of the kings Cyrus and Darius,
   in the time of the prophet Zechariah first mentioned, who was by many
   years the last of the prophets. [685] Or if you mention the lawgivers
   Lycurgus, or Draco, or Minos, Josephus tells us in his writings that
   the sacred books take precedence of them in antiquity, since even
   before the reign of Jupiter over the Cretans, and before the Trojan
   war, the writings of the divine law which has been given to us through
   Moses were in existence. And that we may give a more accurate
   exhibition of eras and dates, we will, God helping us, now give an
   account not only of the dates after the deluge, but also of those
   before it, so as to reckon the whole number of all the years, as far as
   possible; tracing up to the very beginning of the creation of the
   world, which Moses the servant of God recorded through the Holy Spirit.
   For having first spoken of what concerned the creation and genesis of
   the world, and of the first man, and all that happened after in the
   order of events, he signified also the years that elapsed before the
   deluge. And I pray for favour from the only God, that I may accurately
   speak the whole truth according to His will, that you and every one who
   reads this work may be guided by His truth and favour. I will then
   begin first with the recorded genealogies, and I begin my narration
   with the first man. [686]

      Chapter XXIV.--Chronology from Adam.

   Adam lived till he begat a son, [687] 230 years. And his son Seth, 205.
   And his son Enos, 190. And his son Cainan, 170. And his son Mahaleel,
   165. And his son Jared, 162. And his son Enoch, 165. And his son
   Methuselah, 167. And his son Lamech, 188. And Lamech's son was Noah, of
   whom we have spoken above, who begat Shem when 500 years old. During
   Noah's life, in his 600th year, the flood came. The total number of
   years, therefore, till the flood, was 2242. And immediately after the
   flood, Shem, who was 100 years old, begat Arphaxad. And Arphaxad, when
   135 years old, begat Salah. And Salah begat a son when 130. And his son
   Eber, when 134. And from him the Hebrews name their race. And his son
   Phaleg begat a son when 130. And his son Reu, when 132. And his son
   Serug, when 130. And his son Nahor, when 75. And his son Terah, when
   70. And his son Abraham, our patriarch, begat Isaac when he was 100
   years old. Until Abraham, therefore, there are 3278 years. The
   fore-mentioned Isaac lived until he begat a son, 60 years, and begat
   Jacob. Jacob, till the migration into Egypt, of which we have spoken
   above, lived 130 years. And the sojourning of the Hebrews in Egypt
   lasted 430 years; and after their departure from the land of Egypt they
   spent 40 years in the wilderness, as it is called. All these years,
   therefore, amount to 3,938. And at that time, Moses having died, Jesus
   the sun of Nun succeeded to his rule, and governed them 27 years. And
   after Jesus, when the people had transgressed the commandments of God,
   they served the king of Mesopotamia, by name Chusarathon, 8 years.
   Then, on the repentance of the people, they had judges: Gothonoel, 40
   years; Eglon, 18 years; Aoth, 8 years. Then having sinned, they were
   subdued by strangers for 20 years. Then Deborah judged them 40 years.
   Then they served the Midianites 7 years. Then Gideon judged them 40
   years; Abimelech, 3 years; Thola, 22 years; Jair, 22 years. Then the
   Philistines and Ammonites ruled them 18 years. After that Jephthah
   judged them 6 years; Esbon, 7 years; Ailon, 10 years; Abdon, 8 years.
   Then strangers ruled them 40 years. Then Samson judged them 20 years.
   Then there was peace among them for 40 years. Then Samera judged them
   one year; Eli, 20 years; Samuel, 12 years.

      Chapter XXV.--From Saul to the Captivity.

   And after the judges they had kings, the first named Saul, who reigned
   20 years; then David, our forefather, who reigned 40 years.
   Accordingly, there are to the reign of David [from Isaac] 496 years.
   And after these kings Solomon reigned, who also, by the will of God,
   was the first to build the temple in Jerusalem; he reigned 40 years.
   And after him Rehoboam, 17 years; and after him Abias, 7 years; and
   after him Asa, 41 years; and after him Jehoshaphat, 25 years; and after
   him Joram, 8 years; and after him Ahaziah, 1 year; and after him
   Athaliah, 6 years; and after her Josiah, 40 years; and after him
   Amaziah, 39 years; and after him Uzziah, 52 years; and after him
   Jotham, 16 years; and after him Ahaz, 17 years; and after him Hezekiah,
   29 years; and after him Manasseh, 55 years; and after him Amon, 2
   years; and after him Josiah, 31 years; and after him Jehoahaz, 3
   months; and after him Jehoiakim, 11 years. Then another Jehoiakim, 3
   months 10 days; and after him Zedekiah, 11 years. And after these
   kings, the people, continuing in their sins, and not repenting, the
   king of Babylon, named Nebuchadnezzar, came up into Judæa, according to
   the prophecy of Jeremiah. He transferred the people of the Jews to
   Babylon, and destroyed the temple which Solomon had built. And in the
   Babylonian banishment the people passed 70 years. Until the sojourning
   in the land of Babylon, there are therefore, in all, 4954 years 6
   months and 10 days. And according as God had, by the prophet Jeremiah,
   foretold that the people should be led captive to Babylon, in like
   manner He signified beforehand that they should also return into their
   own land after 70 years. These 70 years then being accomplished, Cyrus
   becomes king of the Persians, who, according to the prophecy of
   Jeremiah, issued a decree in the second year of his reign, enjoining by
   his edict that all Jews who were in his kingdom should return to their
   own country, and rebuild their temple to God, which the fore-mentioned
   king of Babylon had demolished. Moreover, Cyrus, in compliance with the
   instructions of God, gave orders to his own bodyguards, Sabessar and
   Mithridates, that the vessels which had been taken out of the temple of
   Judæa by Nebuchadnezzar should be restored, and placed again in the
   temple. In the second year, therefore, of Darius are fulfilled the 70
   years which were foretold by Jeremiah.

      Chapter XXVI.--Contrast Between Hebrew and Greek Writings.

   Hence one can see how our sacred writings are shown to be more ancient
   and true than those of the Greeks and Egyptians, or any other
   historians. For Herodotus and Thucydides, as also Xenophon, and most
   other historians, began their relations from about the reign of Cyrus
   and Darius, not being able to speak with accuracy of prior and ancient
   times. For what great matters did they disclose if they spoke of Darius
   and Cyrus, barbarian kings, or of the Greeks Zopyrus and Hippias, or of
   the wars of the Athenians and Lacedæmonians, or the deeds of Xerxes or
   of Pausanias, who ran the risk of starving to death in the temple of
   Minerva, or the history of Themistocles and the Peloponnesian war, or
   of Alcibiades and Thrasybulus? For my purpose is not to furnish mere
   matter of much talk, but to throw light upon the number of years from
   the foundation of the world, and to condemn the empty labour and
   trifling of these authors, because there have neither been twenty
   thousand times ten thousand years from the flood to the present time,
   as Plato said, affirming that there had been so many years; nor yet 15
   times 10,375 years, as we have already mentioned Apollonius the
   Egyptian gave out; nor is the world uncreated, nor is there a
   spontaneous production of all things, as Pythagoras and the rest
   dreamed; but, being indeed created, it is also governed by the
   providence of God, who made all things; and the whole course of time
   and the years are made plain to those who wish to obey the truth. [688]
   Lest, then, I seem to have made things plain up to the time of Cyrus,
   and to neglect the subsequent periods, as if through inability to
   exhibit them, I will endeavour, by God's help, to give an account,
   according to my ability, of the course of the subsequent times.

      Chapter XXVII.--Roman Chronology to the Death of M. Aurelius.

   When Cyrus, then, had reigned twenty-nine years, and had been slain by
   Tomyris in the country of the Massagetæ, this being in the 62d
   Olympiad, then the Romans began to increase in power, God strengthening
   them, Rome having been founded by Romulus, the reputed child of Mars
   and Ilia, in the 7th Olympiad, on the 21st day of April, the year being
   then reckoned as consisting of ten months. Cyrus, then, having died, as
   we have already said, in the 62d Olympiad, this date falls 220 A.U.C.,
   in which year also Tarquinius, surnamed Superbus, reigned over the
   Romans, who was the first who banished Romans and corrupted the youth,
   and made eunuchs of the citizens, and, moreover, first defiled virgins,
   and then gave them in marriage. On this account he was fitly called
   Superbus in the Roman language, and that is translated "the Proud." For
   he first decreed that those who saluted him should have their salute
   acknowledged by some one else. He reigned twenty-five years. After him
   yearly consuls were introduced, tribunes also and ediles for 453 years,
   whose names we consider it long and superfluous to recount. For if any
   one is anxious to learn them, he will ascertain them from the tables
   which Chryserus the nomenclator compiled: he was a freedman of Aurelius
   Verus, who composed a very lucid record of all things, both names and
   dates, from the rounding of Rome to the death of his own patron, the
   Emperor Verus. The annual magistrates ruled the Romans, as we say, for
   453 years. Afterwards those who are called emperors began in this
   order: first, Caius Julius, who reigned 3 years 4 months 6 days; then
   Augustus, 56 years 4 months 1 day; Tiberius, 22 years; then another
   Caius, 3 years 8 months 7 days; Claudius, 23 years 8 months 24 days;
   Nero, 13 years 6 months 58 days; Galba, 2 years 7 months 6 days; Otho,
   3 months 5 days; Vitellius, 6 months 22 days; Vespasian, 9 years 11
   months 22 days; Titus, 2 years 22 days; Domitian, 15 years 5 months 6
   days; Nerva, 1 year 4 months 10 days; Trajan, 19 years 6 months 16
   days; Adrian, 20 years 10 months 28 days; Antoninus, 22 years 7 months
   6 days; Verus, 19 years 10 days. The time therefore of the Cæsars to
   the death of the Emperor Verus is 237 years 5 days. From the death of
   Cyrus, therefore, and the reign of Tarquinius Superbus, to the death of
   the Emperor Verus, the whole time amounts to 744 years.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXVIII.--Leading Chronological Epochs.

   And from the foundation of the world the whole time is thus traced, so
   far as its main epochs are concerned. From the creation of the world to
   the deluge were 2242 years. And from the deluge to the time when
   Abraham our forefather begat a son, 1036 years. And from Isaac,
   Abraham's son, to the time when the people dwelt with Moses in the
   desert, 660 years. And from the death of Moses and the rule of Joshua
   the son of Nun, to the death of the patriarch David, 498 years. And
   from the death of David and the reign of Solomon to the sojourning of
   the people in the land of Babylon, 518 years 6 months 10 days. And from
   the government of Cyrus to the death of the Emperor Aurelius Verus, 744
   years. All the years from the creation of the world amount to a total
   of 5698 years, and the odd months and days. [689]

      Chapter XXIX.--Antiquity of Christianity.

   These periods, then, and all the above-mentioned facts, being viewed
   collectively, one can see the antiquity of the prophetical writings and
   the divinity of our doctrine, that the doctrine is not recent, nor our
   tenets mythical and false, as some think; but very ancient and true.
   For Thallus mentioned Belus, king of the Assyrians, and Saturn, son of
   Titan, alleging that Belus with the Titans made war against Jupiter and
   the so-called gods in his alliance; and on this occasion he says that
   Gyges, being defeated, fled to Tartessus. At that time Gyges ruled over
   that country, which then was called Acte, but now is named Attica. And
   whence the other countries and cities derived their names, we think it
   unnecessary to recount, especially to you who are acquainted with
   history. That Moses, and not he only, but also most of the prophets who
   followed him, is proved to be older than all writers, and than Saturn
   and Belus and the Trojan war, is manifest. For according to the history
   of Thallus, Belus is found to be 322 years prior to the Trojan war. But
   we have shown above that Moses lived somewhere about 900 or 1000 years
   before the sack of Troy. And as Saturn and Belus flourished at the same
   time, most people do not know which is Saturn and which is Belus. Some
   worship Saturn, and call him Bel or Bal, especially the inhabitants of
   the eastern countries, for they do not know who either Saturn or Belus
   is. And among the Romans he is called Saturn, for neither do they know
   which of the two is more ancient--Saturn or Bel. So far as regards the
   commencement of the Olympiads, they say that the observance dates from
   Iphitus, but according to others from Linus, who is also called Ilius.
   The order which the whole number of years and Olympiads holds, we have
   shown above. I think I have now, according to my ability, accurately
   discoursed both of the godlessness of your practices, [690] and of the
   whole number of the epochs of history. For if even a chronological
   error has been committed by us, of, e.g., 50 or 100, or even 200 years,
   yet not of thousands and tens of thousands, as Plato and Apollonius and
   other mendacious authors have hitherto written. And perhaps our
   knowledge of the whole number of the years is not quite accurate,
   because the odd months and days are not set down in the sacred books.
   [691] But so far as regards the periods we speak of, we are
   corroborated by Berosus, [692] the Chaldæan philosopher, who made the
   Greeks acquainted with the Chaldæan literature, and uttered some things
   concerning the deluge, and many other points of history, in agreement
   with Moses; and with the prophets Jeremiah and Daniel also, he spoke in
   a measure of agreement. For he mentioned what happened to the Jews
   under the king of the Babylonians, whom he calls Abobassor, and who is
   called by the Hebrews Nebuchadnezzar. And he also spoke of the temple
   of Jerusalem; how it was desolated by the king of the Chaldæans, and
   that the foundations of the temple having been laid the second year of
   the reign of Cyrus, the temple was completed in the second year of the
   reign of Darius.

      Chapter XXX.--Why the Greeks Did Not Mention Our Histories.

   But the Greeks make no mention of the histories which give the truth:
   first, because they themselves only recently became partakers of the
   knowledge of letters; and they themselves own it, alleging that letters
   were invented, some say among the Chaldæans, and others with the
   Egyptians, and others again say that they are derived from the
   Phoenicians. And secondly, because they sinned, and still sin, in not
   making mention of God, but of vain and useless matters. For thus they
   most heartily celebrate Homer and Hesiod, and the rest of the poets,
   but the glory of the incorruptible and only God they not only omit to
   mention, but blaspheme; yes, and they persecuted, and do daily
   persecute, those who worship Him. And not only so, but they even bestow
   prizes and honours on those who in harmonious language insult God; but
   of those who are zealous in the pursuit of virtue and practice a holy
   life, some they stoned, some they put to death, and up to the present
   time they subject them to savage tortures. Wherefore such men have
   necessarily lost the wisdom of God, and have not found the truth.

   If you please, then, study these things carefully, that you may have a
   compendium [693] and pledge of the truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [693] Otto prefers sumboulon instead of sumbolon , on the authority of
   one ms. The sense then is, "that you may have a counsellor and pledge
   of the truth,"--the counsellor and pledge of the truth being the book
   written by Theophilus for Autolycus. [This has been supposed to mean,
   "that you may have a token and pledge (or earnest) of the truth," i.e.,
   in Christian baptism. Our author uses St. Paul's word (arrhabon), "the
   earnest of the spirit," as in 2 Cor. i. 22, and Eph. 1.14.]

  Introductory Note

    to the

Writings of Athenagoras
     __________________________________________________________________

   [Translated by the Rev. B. P. Pratten.]

   [a.d. 177.] In placing Athenagoras here, somewhat out of the order
   usually accepted, I commit no appreciable violence against chronology,
   and I gain a great advantage for the reader. To some extent we must
   recognise, in collocation, the principles of affinity and historic
   growth. Closing up the bright succession of the earlier Apologists,
   this favourite author affords also a fitting introduction to the great
   founder of the Alexandrian School, who comes next into view. His work
   opens the way for Clement's elaboration of Justin's claim, that the
   whole of philosophy is embraced in Christianity. It is charming to find
   the primal fountains of Christian thought uniting here, to flow on for
   ever in the widening and deepening channel of Catholic orthodoxy, as it
   gathers into itself all human culture, and enriches the world with
   products of regenerated mind, harvested from its overflow into the
   fields of philosophy and poetry and art and science. More of this when
   we come to Clement, that man of genius who introduced Christianity to
   itself, as reflected in the burnished mirror of his intellect. Shackles
   are falling from the persecuted and imprisoned faculties of the
   faithful, and soon the Faith is to speak out, no more in tones of
   apology, but as mistress of the human mind, and its pilot to new worlds
   of discovery and broad domains of conquest. All hail the freedom with
   which, henceforth, Christians are to assume the overthrow of heathenism
   as a foregone conclusion. The distasteful exposure of heresies was the
   inevitable task after the first victory. It was the chase and
   following-up of the adversary in his limping and cowardly retreat, "the
   scattering of the rear of darkness." With Athenagoras, we touch upon
   tokens of things to come; we see philosophy yoked to the chariot of
   Messiah; we begin to realize that sibylline surrender of outworn
   Paganism, and its forecast of an era of light:--


   "Magnus ab integro sæclorum nascitur ordo,

   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . quo ferrea primum

   Desinet, ac toto surget gens aurea mundo."

   In Athenagoras, whose very name is a retrospect, we discover a remote
   result of St. Paul's speech on Mars Hill. The apostle had cast his
   bread upon the waters of Ilissus and Cephisus to find it after many
   days. "When they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked;"
   but here comes a philosopher, from the Athenian agora, a convert to St.
   Paul's argument in his Epistle to the Corinthians, confessing "the
   unknown God," demolishing the marble mob of deities that so "stirred
   the apostle's spirit within him," and teaching alike the Platonist and
   the Stoic to sit at the feet of Jesus. "Dionysius the Areopagite, and
   the woman named Damaris," are no longer to be despised as the scanty
   first-fruits of Attica. They too have found a voice in this splendid
   trophy of the Gospel; and, "being dead, they yet speak" through him.

   To the meagre facts of his biography, which appear below, there is
   nothing to be added; [694] and I shall restrain my disposition to be a
   commentator, within the limits of scanty notations. In the notes to
   Tatian and Theophilus, I have made the student acquainted with that
   useful addition to his treatise on Justin Martyr, in which the able and
   judicious Bishop Kaye harmonizes those authors with Justin. The same
   harmony enfolds the works of Athenagoras, [695] and thus affords a
   synopsis of Christian teaching under the Antonines; in which precision
   of theological language is yet unattained, but identity of faith is
   clearly exhibited. While the Germans are furnishing the scholar with
   critical editions of the ancients, invaluable for their patient
   accumulations of fact and illustration, they are so daring in theory
   and conjecture when they come to exposition, that one enjoys the
   earnest and wholesome tone of sober comment that distinguishes the
   English theologian. It has the great merit of being inspired by
   profound sympathy with primitive writers, and unadulterated faith in
   the Scriptures. Too often a German critic treats one of these venerable
   witnesses, who yet live and yet speak, as if they were dead subjects on
   the dissecting-table. They cut and carve with anatomical display, and
   use the microscope with scientific skill; but, oh! how frequently they
   surrender the saints of God as mere corpses, into the hands of those
   who count them victims of a blind faith in a dead Christ.

   It will not be necessary, after my quotations from Kaye in the
   foregoing sheets, to do more than indicate similar illustrations of
   Athenagoras to be found in his pages. The dry version often requires
   lubrications of devoutly fragrant exegesis; and providentially they are
   at hand in that elaborate but modest work, of which even this
   generation should not be allowed to lose sight.

   The annotations of Conrad Gesner and Henry Stephans would have greatly
   enriched this edition, had I been permitted to enlarge the work by
   adding a version of them. They are often curious, and are supplemented
   by the interesting letter of Stephans to Peter Nannius, "the eminent
   pillar of Louvain," on the earliest copies of Athenagoras, from which
   modern editions have proceeded. The Paris edition of Justin Martyr
   (1615) contains these notes, as well as the Greek of Tatian,
   Theophilus, and Athenagoras, with a Latin rendering. As Bishop Kaye
   constantly refers to this edition, I have considered myself fortunate
   in possessing it; using it largely in comparing his learned comments
   with the Edinburgh Version.

   A few words as to the noble treatise of our author, on the
   Resurrection. As a firm and loving voice to this keynote of Christian
   faith, it rings like an anthem through all the variations of his
   thought and argument. Comparing his own blessed hope with the delusions
   of a world lying in wickedness, and looking stedfastly to the life of
   the world to come, what a sublime contrast we find in this figure of
   Christ's witness to the sensual life of the heathen, and even to the
   groping wisdom of the Attic sages. I think this treatise a sort of
   growth from the mind of one who had studied in the Academe, pitying yet
   loving poor Socrates and his disciples. Yet more, it is the outcome of
   meditation on that sad history in the Acts, which expounds St. Paul's
   bitter reminiscences, when he says that his gospel was, "to the Greeks,
   foolishness." They never "heard him again on this matter." He left them
   under the confused impressions they had expressed in the agora, when
   they said, "he seemeth to be a setter-forth of new gods." St. Luke
   allows himself a smile only half suppressed when he adds, "because he
   preached unto them Jesus and Anastasis," which in their ears was only a
   barbarian echo to their own Phoebus and Artemis; and what did Athenians
   want of any more wares of that sort, especially under the introduction
   of a poor Jew from parts unknown? Did the apostle's prophetic soul
   foresee Athenagoras, as he "departed from among them"? However that may
   be, his blessed Master "knew what he would do." He could let none of
   Paul's words fall to the ground, without taking care that some seeds
   should bring forth fruit a thousand-fold. Here come the sheaves at
   last. Athenagoras proves, also, what our Saviour meant, when he said to
   the Galileans, "Ye are the light of the world."

   The following is the original Introductory Notice:--

   It is one of the most singular facts in early ecclesiastical history,
   that the name of Athenagoras is scarcely ever mentioned. Only two
   references to him and his writings have been discovered. One of these
   occurs in the work of Methodius, On the Resurrection of the Body, as
   preserved by Epiphanius (Hoer., lxiv.) and Photius (Biblioth.,
   ccxxxiv.). The other notice of him is found in the writings [696] of
   Philip of Side, in Pamphylia, who flourished in the early part of the
   fifth century. It is very remarkable that Eusebius should have been
   altogether silent regarding him; and that writings, so elegant and
   powerful as are those which still exist under his name, should have
   been allowed in early times to sink into almost entire oblivion.

   We know with certainty regarding Athenagoras, that he was an Athenian
   philosopher who had embraced Christianity, and that his Apology, or, as
   he styles it, "Embassy" (presbeia), was presented to the Emperors
   Aurelius and Commodus about a.d. 177. He is supposed to have written a
   considerable number of works, but the only other production of his
   extant is his treatise on the Resurrection. It is probable that this
   work was composed somewhat later than the Apology (see chap. xxxvi.),
   though its exact date cannot be determined. Philip of Side also states
   that he preceded Pantænus as head of the catechetical school at
   Alexandria; but this is probably incorrect, and is contradicted by
   Eusebius. A more interesting and perhaps well-rounded statement is made
   by the same writer respecting Athenagoras, to the effect that he was
   won over to Christianity while reading the Scriptures in order to
   controvert them. [697] Both his Apology and his treatise on the
   Resurrection display a practiced pen and a richly cultured mind. He is
   by far the most elegant, and certainly at the same time one of the
   ablest, of the early Christian Apologists.

   [695] The dogmatic value of a patristic quotation depends on the
   support it finds in other Fathers, under the supremacy of Scripture:
   hence the utility of Kaye's collocations.

   works of Philip by some unknown writer. It is published as an appendix

   [697] [Here a picture suggests itself. We go back to the times of
   Hadrian. A persecution is raging against the "Nazarenes." A boyish, but
   well-cultured Athenian saunters into the market-place to hear some new
   thing. They are talking of those enemies of the human race, the
   Christians. Curiosity leads him to their assemblies. He finds them
   keeping the feast of the resurrection. Quadratus is preaching. He
   mocks, but is persuaded to open one of St. Paul's Epistles. "What will
   this babbler say?" He reads the fifteenth chapter of First Corinthians,
   and resents it with all the objections still preserved in his pages.
   One can see him inquiring more about this Paul, and reading the
   seventeenth chapter of the Acts. What an animated description of his
   own Athens, and in what a new light it reflects the familiar scenes! He
   must refute this Paul. But, when he undertakes it, he falls in love
   when the intrepid assailant of the gods of Greece. Scales fall from his
   own eyes. How he sees it all at last, we find in the two works here
   presented, corresponding as they do, first and last, with the two parts
   of the apostle's speech to the men of Athens.]

      Chapter I.--Injustice Shown Towards the Christians.

   In your empire, greatest of sovereigns, different nations have
   different customs and laws; and no one is hindered by law or fear of
   punishment from following his ancestral usages, however ridiculous
   these may be. A citizen of Ilium calls Hector a god, and pays divine
   honours to Helen, taking her for Adrasteia. The Lacedæmonian venerates
   Agamemnon as Zeus, and Phylonoë the daughter of Tyndarus; and the man
   of Tenedos worships Tennes. [699] The Athenian sacrifices to Erechtheus
   as Poseidon. The Athenians also perform religious rites and celebrate
   mysteries in honour of Agraulus and Pandrosus, women who were deemed
   guilty of impiety for opening the box. In short, among every nation and
   people, men offer whatever sacrifices and celebrate whatever mysteries
   they please. The Egyptians reckon among their gods even cats, and
   crocodiles, and serpents, and asps, and dogs. And to all these both you
   and the laws give permission so to act, deeming, on the one hand, that
   to believe in no god at all is impious and wicked, and on the other,
   that it is necessary for each man to worship the gods he prefers, in
   order that through fear of the deity, men may be kept from wrong-doing.
   But why--for do not, like the multitude, be led astray by hearsay--why
   is a mere name odious to you? [700] Names are not deserving of hatred:
   it is the unjust act that calls for penalty and punishment. And
   accordingly, with admiration of your mildness and gentleness, and your
   peaceful and benevolent disposition towards every man, individuals live
   in the possession of equal rights; and the cities, according to their
   rank, share in equal honour; and the whole empire, under your
   intelligent sway, enjoys profound peace. But for us who are called
   Christians [701] you have not in like manner cared; but although we
   commit no wrong--nay, as will appear in the sequel of this discourse,
   are of all men most piously and righteously disposed towards the Deity
   and towards your government--you allow us to be harassed, plundered,
   and persecuted, the multitude making war upon us for our name alone. We
   venture, therefore, to lay a statement of our case before you--and you
   will learn from this discourse that we suffer unjustly, and contrary to
   all law and reason--and we beseech you to bestow some consideration
   upon us also, that we may cease at length to be slaughtered at the
   instigation of false accusers. For the fine imposed by our persecutors
   does not aim merely at our property, nor their insults at our
   reputation, nor the damage they do us at any other of our greater
   interests. These we hold in contempt, though to the generality they
   appear matters of great importance; for we have learned, not only not
   to return blow for blow, nor to go to law with those who plunder and
   rob us, but to those who smite us on one side of the face to offer the
   other side also, and to those who take away our coat to give likewise
   our cloak. But, when we have surrendered our property, they plot
   against our very bodies and souls, [702] pouring upon us wholesale
   charges of crimes of which we are guiltless even in thought, but which
   belong to these idle praters themselves, and to the whole tribe of
   those who are like them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [699] There are here many varieties of reading: we have followed the
   text suggested by Gesner.

   [700] We here follow the text of Otto; others read hemin.

   [701] [Kaye, 153.]

   [702] [For three centuries the faithful were made witnesses for Jesus
   and the resurrection, even unto death; with "spoiling of their goods,"
   not only, but dying daily, and "counted as sheep for the slaughter."
   What can refuse such testimony? They conquered through suffering. The
   reader will be pleased with this citation from an author, the neglect
   of whose heavenly writings is a sad token of spiritual decline in the
   spirit of our religion:-- "The Lord is sure of His designed advantages
   out of the sufferings of His Church and of His saints for His name. He
   loses nothing, and they lose nothing; but their enemies, when they rage
   most and prevail most, are ever the greatest losers. His own glory
   grows, the graces of His people grow; yea, their very number grows, and
   that, sometimes, most by their greatest sufferings. This was evident in
   the first ages of the Christian Church. Where were the glory of so much
   invincible love and patience, if they had not been so put to it?"

   edition, London, Longmans, 1870.]
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter II.--Claim to Be Treated as Others are When Accused.

   If, indeed, any one can convict us of a crime, be it small or great, we
   do not ask to be excused from punishment, but are prepared to undergo
   the sharpest and most merciless inflictions. But if the accusation
   relates merely to our name--and it is undeniable, that up to the
   present time the stories told about us rest on nothing better than the
   common undiscriminating popular talk, nor has any Christian [703] been
   convicted of crime--it will devolve on you, illustrious and benevolent
   and most learned sovereigns, to remove by law this despiteful
   treatment, so that, as throughout the world both individuals and cities
   partake of your beneficence, we also may feel grateful to you, exulting
   that we are no longer the victims of false accusation. For it does not
   comport with your justice, that others when charged with crimes should
   not be punished till they are convicted, but that in our case the name
   we bear should have more force than the evidence adduced on the trial,
   when the judges, instead of inquiring whether the person arraigned have
   committed any crime, vent their insults on the name, as if that were
   itself a crime. [704] But no name in and by itself is reckoned either
   good or bad; names appear bad or good according as the actions
   underlying them are bad or good. You, however, have yourselves a clear
   knowledge of this, since you are well instructed in philosophy and all
   learning. For this reason, too, those who are brought before you for
   trial, though they may be arraigned on the gravest charges, have no
   fear, because they know that you will inquire respecting their previous
   life, and not be influenced by names if they mean nothing, nor by the
   charges contained in the indictments if they should be false: they
   accept with equal satisfaction, as regards its fairness, the sentence
   whether of condemnation or acquittal. What, therefore, is conceded as
   the common right of all, we claim for ourselves, that we shall not be
   hated and punished because we are called Christians (for what has the
   name [705] to do with our being bad men?), but be tried on any charges
   which may be brought against us, and either be released on our
   disproving them, or punished if convicted of crime--not for the name
   (for no Christian is a bad man unless he falsely profess our
   doctrines), but for the wrong which has been done. It is thus that we
   see the philosophers judged. None of them before trial is deemed by the
   judge either good or bad on account of his science or art, but if found
   guilty of wickedness he is punished, without thereby affixing any
   stigma on philosophy (for he is a bad man for not cultivating
   philosophy in a lawful manner, but science is blameless), while if he
   refutes the false charges he is acquitted. Let this equal justice,
   then, be done to us. Let the life of the accused persons be
   investigated, but let the name stand free from all imputation. I must
   at the outset of my defence entreat you, illustrious emperors, to
   listen to me impartially: not to be carried away by the common
   irrational talk and prejudge the case, but to apply your desire of
   knowledge and love of truth to the examination of our doctrine also.
   Thus, while you on your part will not err through ignorance, we also,
   by disproving the charges arising out of the undiscerning rumour of the
   multitude, shall cease to be assailed.

      Chapter III.--Charges Brought Against the Christians.

   Three things are alleged against us: atheism, Thyestean feasts, [706]
   OEdipodean intercourse. But if these charges are true, spare no class:
   proceed at once against our crimes; destroy us root and branch, with
   our wives and children, if any Christian [707] is found to live like
   the brutes. And yet even the brutes do not touch the flesh of their own
   kind; and they pair by a law of nature, and only at the regular season,
   not from simple wantonness; they also recognise those from whom they
   receive benefits. If any one, therefore, is more savage than the
   brutes, what punishment that he can endure shall be deemed adequate to
   such offences? But, if these things are only idle tales and empty
   slanders, originating in the fact that virtue is opposed by its very
   nature to vice, and that contraries war against one another by a divine
   law (and you are yourselves witnesses that no such iniquities are
   committed by us, for you forbid informations to be laid against us), it
   remains for you to make inquiry concerning our life, our opinions, our
   loyalty and obedience to you and your house and government, and thus at
   length to grant to us the same rights (we ask nothing more) as to those
   who persecute us. For we shall then conquer them, unhesitatingly
   surrendering, as we now do, our very lives for the truth's sake.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [706] [See cap. xxxi. Our Lord was "perfect man," yet our author
   resents the idea of eating the flesh of one's own kind as worse than
   brutal. As to the Eucharist the inference is plain.]

   [707] Thus Otto; others read, "if any one of men."
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter IV.--The Christians are Not Atheists, But Acknowledge One Only
      God.

   As regards, first of all, the allegation that we are atheists--for I
   will meet the charges one by one, that we may not be ridiculed for
   having no answer to give to those who make them--with reason did the
   Athenians adjudge Diagoras guilty of atheism, in that he not only
   divulged the Orphic doctrine, and published the mysteries of Eleusis
   and of the Cabiri, and chopped up the wooden statue of Hercules to boil
   his turnips, but openly declared that there was no God at all. But to
   us, who distinguish God from matter, [708] and teach that matter is one
   thing and God another, and that they are separated by a wide interval
   (for that the Deity is uncreated and eternal, to be beheld by the
   understanding and reason alone, while matter is created and
   perishable), is it not absurd to apply the name of atheism? If our
   sentiments were like those of Diagoras, while we have such incentives
   to piety--in the established order, the universal harmony, the
   magnitude, the colour, the form, the arrangement of the world--with
   reason might our reputation for impiety, as well as the cause of our
   being thus harassed, be charged on ourselves. But, since our doctrine
   acknowledges one God, the Maker of this universe, who is Himself
   uncreated (for that which is does not come to be, but that which is
   not) but has made all things by the Logos which is from Him, we are
   treated unreasonably in both respects, in that we are both defamed and
   persecuted.

      Chapter V.--Testimony of the Poets to the Unity of God. [709]

   Poets and philosophers have not been voted atheists for inquiring
   concerning God. Euripides, speaking of those who, according to popular
   preconception, are ignorantly called gods, says doubtingly:--


   "If Zeus indeed does reign in heaven above,

   He ought not on the righteous ills to send." [710]

   But speaking of Him who is apprehended by the understanding as matter
   of certain knowledge, he gives his opinion decidedly, and with
   intelligence, thus:--


   "Seest thou on high him who, with humid arms,

   Clasps both the boundless ether and the earth?

   Him reckon Zeus, and him regard as God." [711]

   For, as to these so-called gods, he neither saw any real existences, to
   which a name is usually assigned, underlying them ("Zeus," for
   instance: "who Zeus is I know not, but by report"), nor that any names
   were given to realities which actually do exist (for of what use are
   names to those who have no real existences underlying them?); but Him
   he did see by means of His works, considering with an eye to things
   unseen the things which are manifest in air, in ether, on earth. Him
   therefore, from whom proceed all created things, and by whose Spirit
   they are governed, he concluded to be God; and Sophocles agrees with
   him, when he says:--


   "There is one God, in truth there is but one,

   Who made the heavens, and the broad earth beneath." [712]

   [Euripides is speaking] of the nature of God, which fills His works
   with beauty, and teaching both where God must be, and that He must be
   One.

      Chapter VI.--Opinions of the Philosophers as to the One God.

   Philolaus, too, when he says that all things are included in God as in
   a stronghold, teaches that He is one, and that He is superior to
   matter. Lysis and Opsimus [713] thus define God: the one says that He
   is an ineffable number, the other that He is the excess of the greatest
   number beyond that which comes nearest to it. So that since ten is the
   greatest number according to the Pythagoreans, being the Tetractys,
   [714] and containing all the arithmetic and harmonic principles, and
   the Nine stands next to it, God is a unit--that is, one. For the
   greatest number exceeds the next least by one. Then there are Plato and
   Aristotle--not that I am about to go through all that the philosophers
   have said about God, as if I wished to exhibit a complete summary of
   their opinions; for I know that, as you excel all men in intelligence
   and in the power of your rule, in the same proportion do you surpass
   them all in an accurate acquaintance with all learning, cultivating as
   you do each several branch with more success than even those who have
   devoted themselves exclusively to any one. But, inasmuch as it is
   impossible to demonstrate without the citation of names that we are not
   alone in confining the notion of God to unity, I have ventured on an
   enumeration of opinions. Plato, then, says, "To find out the Maker and
   Father of this universe is difficult; and, when found, it is impossible
   to declare Him to all," [715] conceiving of one uncreated and eternal
   God. And if he recognises others as well, such as the sun, moon, and
   stars, yet he recognises them as created: "gods, offspring of gods, of
   whom I am the Maker, and the Father of works which are indissoluble
   apart from my will; but whatever is compounded can be dissolved." [716]
   If, therefore, Plato is not an atheist for conceiving of one uncreated
   God, the Framer of the universe, neither are we atheists who
   acknowledge and firmly hold that He is God who has framed all things by
   the Logos, and holds them in being by His Spirit. Aristotle, again, and
   his followers, recognising the existence of one whom they regard as a
   sort of compound living creature (zoon), speak of God as consisting of
   soul and body, thinking His body to be the etherial space and the
   planetary stars and the sphere of the fixed stars, moving in circles;
   but His soul, the reason which presides over the motion of the body,
   itself not subject to motion, but becoming the cause of motion to the
   other. The Stoics also, although by the appellations they employ to
   suit the changes of matter, which they say is permeated by the Spirit
   of God, they multiply the Deity in name, yet in reality they consider
   God to be one. [717] For, if God is an artistic fire advancing
   methodically to the production of the several things in the world,
   embracing in Himself all the seminal principles by which each thing is
   produced in accordance with fate, and if His Spirit pervades the whole
   world, then God is one according to them, being named Zeus in respect
   of the fervid part (to zeon) of matter, and Hera in respect of the air
   (ho aer), and called by other names in respect of that particular part
   of matter which He pervades.

      Chapter VII.--Superiority of the Christian Doctrine Respecting God.

   Since, therefore, the unity of the Deity is confessed by almost all,
   even against their will, when they come to treat of the first
   principles of the universe, and we in our turn likewise assert that He
   who arranged this universe is God,--why is it that they can say and
   write with impunity what they please concerning the Deity, but that
   against us a law lies in force, though we are able to demonstrate what
   we apprehend and justly believe, namely that there is one God, with
   proofs and reason accordant with truth? For poets and philosophers, as
   to other subjects so also to this, have applied themselves in the way
   of conjecture, moved, by reason of their affinity with the afflatus
   from God, [718] each one by his own soul, to try whether he could find
   out and apprehend the truth; but they have not been found competent
   fully to apprehend it, because they thought fit to learn, not from God
   concerning God, but each one from himself; hence they came each to his
   own conclusion respecting God, and matter, and forms, and the world.
   But we have for witnesses of the things we apprehend and believe,
   prophets, men who have pronounced concerning God and the things of God,
   guided by the Spirit of God. And you too will admit, excelling all
   others as you do in intelligence and in piety towards the true God (to
   ontos theion), that it would be irrational for us to cease to believe
   in the Spirit from God, who moved the mouths of the prophets like
   musical instruments, and to give heed to mere human opinions.

      Chapter VIII.--Absurdities of Polytheism.

   As regards, then, the doctrine that there was from the beginning one
   God, the Maker of this universe, consider it in this wise, that you may
   be acquainted with the argumentative grounds also of our faith. If
   there were from the beginning two or more gods, they were either in one
   and the same place, or each of them separately in his own. In one and
   the same place they could not be. For, if they are gods, they are not
   alike; but because they are uncreated they are unlike: for created
   things are like their patterns; but the uncreated are unlike, being
   neither produced from any one, nor formed after the pattern of any one.
   Hand and eye and foot are parts of one body, making up together one
   man: is God in this sense one? [719] And indeed Socrates was compounded
   and divided into parts, just because he was created and perishable; but
   God is uncreated, and, impassible, and indivisible--does not,
   therefore, consist of parts. But if, on the contrary, each of them
   exists separately, since He that made the world is above the things
   created, and about the things He has made and set in order, where can
   the other or the rest be? For if the world, being made spherical, is
   confined within the circles of heaven, and the Creator of the world is
   above the things created, managing that [720] by His providential care
   of these, what place is there for the second god, or for the other
   gods? For he is not in the world, because it belongs to the other; nor
   about the world, for God the Maker of the world is above it. But if he
   is neither in the world nor about the world (for all that surrounds it
   is occupied by this one [721] ), where is he? Is he above the world and
   [the first] God? In another world, or about another? But if he is in
   another or about another, then he is not about us, for he does not
   govern the world; nor is his power great, for he exists in a
   circumscribed space. But if he is neither in another world (for all
   things are filled by the other), nor about another (for all things are
   occupied by the other), he clearly does not exist at all, for there is
   no place in which he can be. Or what does he do, seeing there is
   another to whom the world belongs, and he is above the Maker of the
   world, and yet is neither in the world nor about the world? Is there,
   then, some other place where he can stand? But God, and what belongs to
   God, are above him. And what, too, shall be the place, seeing that the
   other fills the regions which are above the world? Perhaps he exerts a
   providential care? [By no means.] And yet, unless he does so, he has
   done nothing. If, then, he neither does anything nor exercises
   providential care, and if there is not another place in which he is,
   then this Being of whom we speak is the one God from the beginning, and
   the sole Maker of the world.

      Chapter IX.--The Testimony of the Prophets.

   If we satisfied ourselves with advancing such considerations as these,
   our doctrines might by some be looked upon as human. But, since the
   voices of the prophets confirm our arguments--for I think that you
   also, with your great zeal for knowledge, and your great attainments in
   learning, cannot be ignorant of the writings either of Moses or of
   Isaiah and Jeremiah, and the other prophets, who, lifted in ecstasy
   above the natural operations of their minds by the impulses of the
   Divine Spirit, uttered the things with which they were inspired, the
   Spirit making use of them as a flute-player [722] breathes into a
   flute;--what, then, do these men say? "The Lord is our God; no other
   can be compared with Him." [723] And again: "I am God, the first and
   the last, and besides Me there is no God." [724] In like manner:
   "Before Me there was no other God, and after Me there shall be none; I
   am God, and there is none besides Me." [725] And as to His greatness:
   "Heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool of My feet: what
   house will ye build for Me, or what is the place of My rest?" [726] But
   I leave it to you, when you meet with the books themselves, to examine
   carefully the prophecies contained in them, that you may on fitting
   grounds defend us from the abuse cast upon us.

      Chapter X.--The Christians Worship the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

   That we are not atheists, therefore, seeing that we acknowledge one
   God, uncreated, eternal, invisible, impassible, incomprehensible,
   illimitable, who is apprehended by the understanding only and the
   reason, who is encompassed by light, and beauty, and spirit, and power
   ineffable, by whom the universe has been created through His Logos, and
   set in order, and is kept in being--I have sufficiently demonstrated.
   [I say "His Logos"], for we acknowledge also a Son of God. Nor let any
   one think it ridiculous that God should have a Son. For though the
   poets, in their fictions, represent the gods as no better than men, our
   mode of thinking is not the same as theirs, concerning either God the
   Father or the Son. But the Son of God is the Logos of the Father, in
   idea and in operation; for after the pattern of Him and by Him [727]
   were all things made, the Father and the Son being one. And, the Son
   being in the Father and the Father in the Son, in oneness and power of
   spirit, the understanding and reason (nous kai logos) of the Father is
   the Son of God. But if, in your surpassing intelligence, [728] it
   occurs to you to inquire what is meant by the Son, I will state briefly
   that He is the first product of the Father, not as having been brought
   into existence (for from the beginning, God, who is the eternal mind
   [nous], had the Logos in Himself, being from eternity instinct with
   Logos [logikos]); but inasmuch as He came forth to be the idea and
   energizing power of all material things, which lay like a nature
   without attributes, and an inactive earth, the grosser particles being
   mixed up with the lighter. The prophetic Spirit also agrees with our
   statements. "The Lord," it says, "made me, the beginning of His ways to
   His works." [729] The Holy Spirit Himself also, which operates in the
   prophets, we assert to be an effluence of God, flowing from Him, and
   returning back again like a beam of the sun. Who, then, would not be
   astonished to hear men who speak of God the Father, and of God the Son,
   and of the Holy Spirit, [730] and who declare both their power in union
   and their distinction in order, called atheists? Nor is our teaching in
   what relates to the divine nature confined to these points; but we
   recognise also a multitude of angels and ministers, [731] whom God the
   Maker and Framer of the world distributed and appointed to their
   several posts by His Logos, to occupy themselves about the elements,
   and the heavens, and the world, and the things in it, and the goodly
   ordering of them all.

      Chapter XI.--The Moral Teaching of the Christians Repels the Charge
      Brought Against Them.

   If I go minutely into the particulars of our doctrine, let it not
   surprise you. It is that you may not be carried away by the popular and
   irrational opinion, but may have the truth clearly before you. For
   presenting the opinions themselves to which we adhere, as being not
   human but uttered and taught by God, we shall be able to persuade you
   not to think of us as atheists. What, then, are those teachings in
   which we are brought up? "I say unto you, Love your enemies; bless them
   that curse you; pray for them that persecute you; that ye may be the
   sons of your Father who is in heaven, who causes His sun to rise on the
   evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust." [732]
   Allow me here to lift up my voice boldly in loud and audible outcry,
   pleading as I do before philosophic princes. For who of those that
   reduce syllogisms, and clear up ambiguities, and explain etymologies,
   [733] or of those who teach homonyms and synonyms, and predicaments and
   axioms, and what is the subject and what the predicate, and who promise
   their disciples by these and such like instructions to make them happy:
   who of them have so purged their souls as, instead of hating their
   enemies, to love them; and, instead of speaking ill of those who have
   reviled them (to abstain from which is of itself an evidence of no mean
   forbearance), to bless them; and to pray for those who plot against
   their lives? On the contrary, they never cease with evil intent to
   search out skilfully the secrets of their art, [734] and are ever bent
   on working some ill, making the art of words and not the exhibition of
   deeds their business and profession. But among us you will find
   uneducated persons, and artisans, and old women, who, if they are
   unable in words to prove the benefit of our doctrine, yet by their
   deeds exhibit the benefit arising from their persuasion of its truth:
   they do not rehearse speeches, but exhibit good works; when struck,
   they do not strike again; when robbed, they do not go to law; they give
   to those that ask of them, and love their neighbours as themselves.

      Chapter XII.--Consequent Absurdity of the Charge of Atheism.

   Should we, then, unless we believed that a God presides over the human
   race, thus purge ourselves from evil? Most certainly not. But, because
   we are persuaded that we shall give an account of everything in the
   present life to God, who made us and the world, we adopt a temperate
   and benevolent and generally despised method of life, believing that we
   shall suffer no such great evil here, even should our lives be taken
   from us, compared with what we shall there receive for our meek and
   benevolent and moderate life from the great Judge. Plato indeed has
   said that Minos and Rhadamanthus will judge and punish the wicked; but
   we say that, even if a man be Minos or Rhadamanthus himself, or their
   father, even he will not escape the judgment of God. Are, then, those
   who consider life to be comprised in this, "Let us eat and drink, for
   to-morrow we die," and who regard death as a deep sleep and
   forgetfulness ("sleep and death, twin brothers" [735] ), to be
   accounted pious; while men who reckon the present life of very small
   worth indeed, and who are conducted to the future life by this one
   thing alone, that they know God and His Logos, what is the oneness of
   the Son with the Father, what the communion of the Father with the Son,
   what is the Spirit, what is the unity of these three, the Spirit, the
   Son, the Father, and their distinction in unity; and who know that the
   life for which we look is far better than can be described in words,
   provided we arrive at it pure from all wrong-doing; who, moreover,
   carry our benevolence to such an extent, that we not only love our
   friends ("for if ye love them," He says, "that love you, and lend to
   them that lend to you, what reward will ye have?" [736] ),--shall we, I
   say, when such is our character, and when we live such a life as this,
   that we may escape condemnation at last, not be accounted pious? These,
   however, are only small matters taken from great, and a few things from
   many, that we may not further trespass on your patience; for those who
   test honey and whey, judge by a small quantity whether the whole is
   good.

      Chapter XIII.--Why the Christians Do Not Offer Sacrifices.

   But, as most of those who charge us with atheism, and that because they
   have not even the dreamiest conception of what God is, and are doltish
   and utterly unacquainted with natural and divine things, and such as
   measure piety by the rule of sacrifices, charges us with not
   acknowledging the same gods as the cities, be pleased to attend to the
   following considerations, O emperors, on both points. And first, as to
   our not sacrificing: the Framer and Father of this universe does not
   need blood, nor the odour of burnt-offerings, nor the fragrance of
   flowers and incense, [737] forasmuch as He is Himself perfect
   fragrance, needing nothing either within or without; but the noblest
   sacrifice [738] to Him is for us to know who stretched out and vaulted
   the heavens, and fixed the earth in its place like a centre, who
   gathered the water into seas and divided the light from the darkness,
   who adorned the sky with stars and made the earth to bring forth seed
   of every kind, who made animals and fashioned man. When, holding God to
   be this Framer of all things, who preserves them in being and
   superintends them all by knowledge and administrative skill, we "lift
   up holy hands" to Him, what need has He further of a hecatomb?


   "For they, when mortals have transgress'd or fail'd

   To do aright, by sacrifice and pray'r,

   Libations and burnt-offerings, may be soothed." [739]

   And what have I to do with holocausts, which God does not stand in need
   of?--though indeed it does behove us to offer a bloodless sacrifice and
   "the service of our reason." [740]

   now teach, was unknown to Athenagoras.]

      Chapter XIV.--Inconsistency of Those Who Accuse the Christians.

   Then, as to the other complaint, that we do not pray to and believe in
   the same gods as the cities, it is an exceedingly silly one. Why, the
   very men who charge us with atheism for not admitting the same gods as
   they acknowledge, are not agreed among themselves concerning the gods.
   The Athenians have set up as gods Celeus and Metanira: the
   Lacedæmonians Menelaus; and they offer sacrifices and hold festivals to
   him, while the men of Ilium cannot endure the very sound of his name,
   and pay their adoration to Hector. The Ceans worship Aristæus,
   considering him to be the same as Zeus and Apollo; the Thasians
   Theagenes, a man who committed murder at the Olympic games; the Samians
   Lysander, notwithstanding all the slaughters and all the crimes
   perpetrated by him; Alcman and Hesiod Medea, and the Cilicians Niobe;
   the Sicilians Philip the son of Butacides; the Amathusians Onesilus;
   the Carthaginians Hamilcar. Time would fail me to enumerate the whole.
   When, therefore, they differ among themselves concerning their gods,
   why do they bring the charge against us of not agreeing with them? Then
   look at the practices prevailing among the Egyptians: are they not
   perfectly ridiculous? For in the temples at their solemn festivals they
   beat their breasts as for the dead, and sacrifice to the same beings as
   gods; and no wonder, when they look upon the brutes as gods, and shave
   themselves when they die, and bury them in temples, and make public
   lamentation. If, then, we are guilty of impiety because we do not
   practice a piety corresponding with theirs, then all cities and all
   nations are guilty of impiety, for they do not all acknowledge the same
   gods.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XV.--The Christians Distinguish God from Matter.

   But grant that they acknowledge the same. What then? Because the
   multitude, who cannot distinguish between matter and God, or see how
   great is the interval which lies between them, pray to idols made of
   matter, are we therefore, who do distinguish and separate the uncreated
   and the created, that which is and that which is not, that which is
   apprehended by the understanding and that which is perceived by the
   senses, and who give the fitting name to each of them,--are we to come
   and worship images? If, indeed, matter and God are the same, two names
   for one thing, then certainly, in not regarding stocks and stones, gold
   and silver, as gods, we are guilty of impiety. But if they are at the
   greatest possible remove from one another--as far asunder as the artist
   and the materials of his art--why are we called to account? For as is
   the potter and the clay (matter being the clay, and the artist the
   potter), so is God, the Framer of the world, and matter, which is
   subservient to Him for the purposes of His art. [741] But as the clay
   cannot become vessels of itself without art, so neither did matter,
   which is capable of taking all forms, receive, apart from God the
   Framer, distinction and shape and order. And as we do not hold the
   pottery of more worth than him who made it, nor the vessels of glass
   and gold than him who wrought them; but if there is anything about them
   elegant in art we praise the artificer, and it is he who reaps the
   glory of the vessels: even so with matter and God--the glory and honour
   of the orderly arrangement of the world belongs of right not to matter,
   but to God, the Framer of matter. So that, if we were to regard the
   various forms of matter as gods, we should seem to be without any sense
   of the true God, because we should be putting the things which are
   dissoluble and perishable on a level with that which is eternal.

      Chapter XVI.--The Christians Do Not Worship the Universe.

   Beautiful without doubt is the world, excelling, [742] as well in its
   magnitude as in the arrangement of its parts, both those in the oblique
   circle and those about the north, and also in its spherical form. [743]
   Yet it is not this, but its Artificer, that we must worship. For when
   any of your subjects come to you, they do not neglect to pay their
   homage to you, their rulers and lords, from whom they will obtain
   whatever they need, and address themselves to the magnificence of your
   palace; but, if they chance to come upon the royal residence, they
   bestow a passing glance of admiration on its beautiful structure: but
   it is to you yourselves that they show honour, as being "all in all."
   You sovereigns, indeed, rear and adorn your palaces for yourselves; but
   the world was not created because God needed it; for God is Himself
   everything to Himself,--light unapproachable, a perfect world, spirit,
   power, reason. If, therefore, the world is an instrument in tune, and
   moving in well-measured time, I adore the Being who gave its harmony,
   and strikes its notes, and sings the accordant strain, and not the
   instrument. For at the musical contests the adjudicators do not pass by
   the lute-players and crown the lutes. Whether, then, as Plato says, the
   world be a product of divine art, I admire its beauty, and adore the
   Artificer; or whether it be His essence and body, as the Peripatetics
   affirm, we do not neglect to adore God, who is the cause of the motion
   of the body, and descend "to the poor and weak elements," adoring in
   the impassible [744] air (as they term it), passible matter; or, if any
   one apprehends the several parts of the world to be powers of God, we
   do not approach and do homage to the powers, but their Maker and Lord.
   I do not ask of matter what it has not to give, nor passing God by do I
   pay homage to the elements, which can do nothing more than what they
   were bidden; for, although they are beautiful to look upon, by reason
   of the art of their Framer, yet they still have the nature of matter.
   And to this view Plato also bears testimony; "for," says he, "that
   which is called heaven and earth has received many blessings from the
   Father, but yet partakes of body; hence it cannot possibly be free from
   change." [745] If, therefore, while I admire the heavens and the
   elements in respect of their art, I do not worship them as gods,
   knowing that the law of dissolution is upon them, how can I call those
   objects gods of which I know the makers to be men? Attend, I beg, to a
   few words on this subject.

      Chapter XVII.--The Names of the Gods and Their Images are But of Recent
      Date.

   An apologist must adduce more precise arguments than I have yet given,
   both concering the names of the gods, to show that they are of recent
   origin, and concerning their images, to show that they are, so to say,
   but of yesterday. You yourselves, however, are thoroughly acquainted
   with these matters, since you are versed in all departments of
   knowledge, and are beyond all other men familiar with the ancients. I
   assert, then, that it was Orpheus, and Homer, and Hesiod who [746] gave
   both genealogies and names to those whom they call gods. Such, too, is
   the testimony of Herodotus. [747] "My opinion," he says, "is that
   Hesiod and Homer preceded me by four hundred years, and no more; and it
   was they who framed a theogony for the Greeks, and gave the gods their
   names, and assigned them their several honours and functions, and
   described their forms." Representations of the gods, again, were not in
   use at all, so long as statuary, and painting, and sculpture were
   unknown; nor did they become common until Saurias the Samian, and Crato
   the Sicyonian, and Cleanthes the Corinthian, and the Corinthian damsel
   [748] appeared, when drawing in outline was invented by Saurias, who
   sketched a horse in the sun, and painting by Crato, who painted in oil
   on a whitened tablet the outlines of a man and woman; and the art of
   making figures in relief (koroplathike) was invented by the damsel,
   [749] who, being in love with a person, traced his shadow on a wall as
   he lay asleep, and her father, being delighted with the exactness of
   the resemblance (he was a potter), carved out the sketch and filled it
   up with clay: this figure is still preserved at Corinth. After these,
   Dædalus and Theodorus the Milesian further invented sculpture and
   statuary. You perceive, then, that the time since representations of
   form and the making of images began is so short, that we can name the
   artist of each particular god. The image of Artemis at Ephesus, for
   example, and that of Athenâ (or rather of Athelâ, for so is she named
   by those who speak more in the style of the mysteries; for thus was the
   ancient image made of the olive-tree called), and the sitting figure of
   the same goddess, were made by Endoeus, a pupil of Dædalus; the Pythian
   god was the work of Theodorus and Telecles; and the Delian god and
   Artemis are due to the art of Tectæus and Angelio; Hera in Samos and in
   Argos came from the hands of Smilis, and the other statues [750] were
   by Phidias; Aphrodité the courtezan in Cnidus is the production of
   Praxiteles; Asclepius in Epidaurus is the work of Phidias. In a word,
   of not one of these statues can it be said that it was not made by man.
   If, then, these are gods, why did they not exist from the beginning?
   Why, in sooth, are they younger than those who made them? Why, in
   sooth, in order to their coming into existence, did they need the aid
   of men and art? They are nothing but earth, and stones, and matter, and
   curious art. [751]

      Chapter XVIII.--The Gods Themselves Have Been Created, as the Poets
      Confess.

   But, since it is affirmed by some that, although these are only images,
   yet there exist gods in honour of whom they are made; and that the
   supplications and sacrifices presented to the images are to be referred
   to the gods, and are in fact made to the gods; [752] and that there is
   not any other way of coming to them, for


   "'Tis hard for man

   To meet in presence visible a God;" [753]

   and whereas, in proof that such is the fact, they adduce the energies
   possessed by certain images, let us examine into the power attached to
   their names. And I would beseech you, greatest of emperors, before I
   enter on this discussion, to be indulgent to me while I bring forward
   true considerations; for it is not my design to show the fallacy of
   idols, but, by disproving the calumnies vented against us, to offer a
   reason for the course of life we follow. May you, by considering
   yourselves, be able to discover the heavenly kingdom also! For as all
   things are subservient to you, father and son, [754] who have received
   the kingdom from above (for "the king's soul is in the hand of God,"
   [755] saith the prophetic Spirit), so to the one God and the Logos
   proceeding from Him, the Son, apprehended by us as inseparable from
   Him, all things are in like manner subjected. This then especially I
   beg you carefully to consider. The gods, as they affirm, were not from
   the beginning, but every one of them has come into existence just like
   ourselves. And in this opinion they all agree. Homer speaks of


   "Old Oceanus,

   The sire of gods, and Tethys;" [756]

   and Orpheus (who, moreover, was the first to invent their names, and
   recounted their births, and narrated the exploits of each, and is
   believed by them to treat with greater truth than others of divine
   things, whom Homer himself follows in most matters, especially in
   reference to the gods)--he, too, has fixed their first origin to be
   from water:--


   "Oceanus, the origin of all."

   For, according to him, water was the beginning of all things, and from
   water mud was formed, and from both was produced an animal, a dragon
   with the head of a lion growing to it, and between the two heads there
   was the face of a god, named Heracles and Kronos. This Heracles
   generated an egg of enormous size, which, on becoming full, was, by the
   powerful friction of its generator, burst into two, the part at the top
   receiving the form of heaven (ouranos), and the lower part that of
   earth (ge). The goddess Gê moreover, came forth with a body; and
   Ouranos, by his union with Gê, begat females, Clotho, Lachesis, and
   Atropos; and males, the hundred-handed Cottys, Gyges, Briareus, and the
   Cyclopes Brontes, and Steropes, and Argos, whom also he bound and
   hurled down to Tartarus, having learnt that he was to be ejected from
   his government by his children; whereupon Gê, being enraged, brought
   forth the Titans. [757]


   "The godlike Gaia bore to Ouranos

   Sons who are by the name of Titans known,

   Because they vengeance [758] took on Ouranos,

   Majestic, glitt'ring with his starry crown." [759]

      Chapter XIX.--The Philosophers Agree with the Poets Respecting the Gods.

   Such was the beginning of the existence both of their gods and of the
   universe. Now what are we to make of this? For each of those things to
   which divinity is ascribed is conceived of as having existed from the
   first. For, if they have come into being, having previously had no
   existence, as those say who treat of the gods, they do not exist. For,
   a thing is either uncreated and eternal, or created and perishable. Nor
   do I think one thing and the philosophers another. "What is that which
   always is, and has no origin; or what is that which has been
   originated, yet never is?" [760] Discoursing of the intelligible and
   the sensible, Plato teaches that that which always is, the
   intelligible, is unoriginated, but that which is not, the sensible, is
   originated, beginning to be and ceasing to exist. In like manner, the
   Stoics also say that all things will be burnt up and will again exist,
   the world receiving another beginning. But if, although there is,
   according to them, a twofold cause, one active and governing, namely
   providence, the other passive and changeable, namely matter, it is
   nevertheless impossible for the world, even though under the care of
   Providence, to remain in the same state, because it is created--how can
   the constitution of these gods remain, who are not self-existent, [761]
   but have been originated? And in what are the gods superior to matter,
   since they derive their constitution from water? But not even water,
   according to them, is the beginning of all things. From simple and
   homogeneous elements what could be constituted? Moreover, matter
   requires an artificer, and the artificer requires matter. For how could
   figures be made without matter or an artificer? Neither, again, is it
   reasonable that matter should be older than God; for the efficient
   cause must of necessity exist before the things that are made.

      Chapter XX.--Absurd Representations of the Gods.

   If the absurdity of their theology were confined to saying that the
   gods were created, and owed their constitution to water, since I have
   demonstrated that nothing is made which is not also liable to
   dissolution, I might proceed to the remaining charges. But, on the one
   hand, they have described their bodily forms: speaking of Hercules, for
   instance, as a god in the shape of a dragon coiled up; of others as
   hundred-handed; of the daughter of Zeus, whom he begat of his mother
   Rhea; or of Demeter, as having two eyes in the natural order, and two
   in her forehead, and the face of an animal on the back part of her
   neck, and as having also horns, so that Rhea, frightened at her monster
   of a child, fled from her, and did not give her the breast (thele),
   whence mystically she is called Athêlâ, but commonly Phersephoné and
   Koré, though she is not the same as Athênâ, [762] who is called Koré
   from the pupil of the eye;--and, on the other hand, they have described
   their admirable [763] achievements, as they deem them: how Kronos, for
   instance, mutilated his father, and hurled him down from his chariot,
   and how he murdered his children, and swallowed the males of them; and
   how Zeus bound his father, and cast him down to Tartarus, as did
   Ouranos also to his sons, and fought with the Titans for the
   government; and how he persecuted his mother Rhea when she refused to
   wed him, and, she becoming a she-dragon, and he himself being changed
   into a dragon, bound her with what is called the Herculean knot, and
   accomplished his purpose, of which fact the rod of Hermes is a symbol;
   and again, how he violated his daughter Phersephoné, in this case also
   assuming the form of a dragon, and became the father of Dionysus. In
   face of narrations like these, I must say at least this much, What that
   is becoming or useful is there in such a history, that we must believe
   Kronos, Zeus, Koré, and the rest, to be gods? Is it the descriptions of
   their bodies? Why, what man of judgment and reflection will believe
   that a viper was begotten by a god (thus Orpheus:--


   "But from the sacred womb Phanes begat

   Another offspring, horrible and fierce,

   In sight a frightful viper, on whose head

   Were hairs: its face was comely; but the rest,

   From the neck downwards, bore the aspect dire

   Of a dread dragon" [764] );

   or who will admit that Phanes himself, being a first-born god (for he
   it was that was produced from the egg), has the body or shape of a
   dragon, or was swallowed by Zeus, that Zeus might be too large to be
   contained? For if they differ in no respect from the lowest brutes
   (since it is evident that the Deity must differ from the things of
   earth and those that are derived from matter), they are not gods. How,
   then, I ask, can we approach them as suppliants, when their origin
   resembles that of cattle, and they themselves have the form of brutes,
   and are ugly to behold?

      Chapter XXI.--Impure Loves Ascribed to the Gods.

   But should it be said that they only had fleshly forms, and possess
   blood and seed, and the affections of anger and sexual desire, even
   then we must regard such assertions as nonsensical and ridiculous; for
   there is neither anger, nor desire and appetite, nor procreative seed,
   in gods. Let them, then, have fleshly forms, but let them be superior
   to wrath and anger, that Athênâ may not be seen


   "Burning with rage and inly wroth with Jove;" [765]

   nor Hera appear thus:--


   "Juno's breast

   Could not contain her rage." [766]

   And let them be superior to grief:--


   "A woful sight mine eyes behold: a man

   I love in flight around the walls! My heart

   For Hector grieves." [767]

   For I call even men rude and stupid who give way to anger and grief.
   But when the "father of men and gods" mourns for his son,--


   "Woe, woe! that fate decrees my best belov'd

   Sarpedon, by Patroclus' hand to fall;" [768]

   and is not able while he mourns to rescue him from his peril:--


   "The son of Jove, yet Jove preserv'd him not;" [769]

   who would not blame the folly of those who, with tales like these, are
   lovers of the gods, or rather, live without any god? Let them have
   fleshly forms, but let not Aphrodité be wounded by Diomedes in her
   body:--


   "The haughty son of Tydeus, Diomed,

   Hath wounded me;" [770]

   or by Arês in her soul:--


   "Me, awkward me, she scorns; and yields her charms

   To that fair lecher, the strong god of arms." [771]

   "The weapon pierced the flesh." [772]

   He who was terrible in battle, the ally of Zeus against the Titans, is
   shown to be weaker than Diomedes:--


   "He raged, as Mars, when brandishing his spear." [773]

   Hush! Homer, a god never rages. But you describe the god to me as
   blood-stained, and the bane of mortals:--


   "Mars, Mars, the bane of mortals, stained with blood;" [774]

   and you tell of his adultery and his bonds:--


   "Then, nothing loth, th' enamour'd fair he led,

   And sunk transported on the conscious bed.

   Down rushed the toils." [775]

   Do they not pour forth impious stuff of this sort in abundance
   concerning the gods? Ouranos is mutilated; Kronos is bound, and thrust
   down to Tartarus; the Titans revolt; Styx dies in battle: yea, they
   even represent them as mortal; they are in love with one another; they
   are in love with human beings:--


   "Æneas, amid Ida's jutting peaks,

   Immortal Venus to Anchises bore." [776]

   Are they not in love? Do they not suffer? Nay, verily, they are gods,
   and desire cannot touch them! Even though a god assume flesh in
   pursuance of a divine purpose, [777] he is therefore the slave of
   desire.


   "For never yet did such a flood of love,

   For goddess or for mortal, fill my soul;

   Not for Ixion's beauteous wife, who bore

   Pirithöus, sage in council as the gods;

   Nor the neat-footed maiden Danäe,

   A crisius' daughter, her who Perséus bore,

   Th' observ'd of all; nor noble Phoenix' child;

   .  .  .  .  .  .  nor for Semele;

   Nor for Alcmena fair;  .  .  .

   No, nor for Ceres, golden-tressèd queen;

   Nor for Latona bright; nor for thyself." [778]

   He is created, he is perishable, with no trace of a god in him. Nay,
   they are even the hired servants of men:--


   "Admetus' halls, in which I have endured

   To praise the menial table, though a god." [779]

   And they tend cattle:--


   "And coming to this land, I cattle fed,

   For him that was my host, and kept this house." [780]

   Admetus, therefore, was superior to the god. Prophet and wise one, and
   who canst foresee for others the things that shall be, thou didst not
   divine the slaughter of thy beloved, but didst even kill him with thine
   own hand, dear as he was:--


   "And I believed Apollo's mouth divine

   Was full of truth, as well as prophet's art."

   (Æschylus is reproaching Apollo for being a false prophet:)--


   "The very one who sings while at the feast,

   The one who said these things, alas! is he

   Who slew my son." [781]

      Chapter XXII.--Pretended Symbolical Explanations.

   But perhaps these things are poetic vagary, and there is some natural
   explanation of them, such as this by Empedocles:--


   "Let Jove be fire, and Juno source of life,

   With Pluto and Nêstis, who bathes with tears

   The human founts."

   If, then, Zeus is fire, and Hera the earth, and Aïdoneus the air, and
   Nêstis water, and these are elements--fire, water, air--none of them is
   a god, neither Zeus, nor Hera, nor Aïdoneus; for from matter separated
   into parts by God is their constitution and origin:--


   "Fire, water, earth, and the air's gentle height,

   And harmony with these."

   Here are things which without harmony cannot abide; which would be
   brought to ruin by strife: how then can any one say that they are gods?
   Friendship, according to Empedocles, has an aptitude to govern, things
   that are compounded are governed, and that which is apt to govern has
   the dominion; so that if we make the power of the governed and the
   governing one and the same, we shall be, unawares to ourselves, putting
   perishable and fluctuating and changeable matter on an equality with
   the uncreated, and eternal, and ever self-accordant God. Zeus is,
   according to the Stoics, the fervid part of nature; Hera is the air
   (aer)--the very name, if it be joined to itself, signifying this; [782]
   Poseidon is what is drunk (water, posis). But these things are by
   different persons explained of natural objects in different ways. Some
   call Zeus twofold masculine-feminine air; others the season which
   brings about mild weather, on which account it was that he alone
   escaped from Kronos. But to the Stoics it may be said, If you
   acknowledge one God, the supreme and uncreated and eternal One, and as
   many compound bodies as there are changes of matter, and say that the
   Spirit of God, which pervades matter, obtains according to its
   variations a diversity of names, the forms of matter will become the
   body of God; but when the elements are destroyed in the conflagration,
   the names will necessarily perish along with the forms, the Spirit of
   God alone remaining. Who, then, can believe that those bodies, of which
   the variation according to matter is allied to corruption, are gods?
   But to those who say that Kronos is time, and Rhea the earth, and that
   she becomes pregnant by Kronos, and brings forth, whence she is
   regarded as the mother of all; and that he begets and devours his
   offspring; and that the mutilation is the intercourse of the male with
   the female, which cuts off the seed and casts it into the womb, and
   generates a human being, who has in himself the sexual desire, which is
   Aphrodité; and that the madness of Kronos is the turn of season, which
   destroys animate and inanimate things; and that the bonds and Tartarus
   are time, which is changed by seasons and disappears;--to such persons
   we say, If Kronos is time, he changes; if a season, he turns about; if
   darkness, or frost, or the moist part of nature, none of these is
   abiding; but the Deity is immortal, and immoveable, and unalterable: so
   that neither is Kronos nor his image God. As regards Zeus again: If he
   is air, born of Kronos, of which the male part is called Zeus and the
   female Hera (whence both sister and wife), he is subject to change; if
   a season, he turns about: but the Deity neither changes nor shifts
   about. But why should I trespass on your patience by saying more, when
   you know so well what has been said by each of those who have resolved
   these things into nature, or what various writers have thought
   concerning nature, or what they say concerning Athênâ, whom they affirm
   to be the wisdom (phronesis) pervading all things; and concerning Isis,
   whom they call the birth of all time (phusis aionos), from whom all
   have sprung, and by whom all exist; or concerning Osiris, on whose
   murder by Typhon his brother Isis with her son Orus sought after his
   limbs, and finding them honoured them with a sepulchre, which sepulchre
   is to this day called the tomb of Osiris? For whilst they wander up and
   down about the forms of matter, they miss to find the God who can only
   be beheld by the reason, while they deify the elements and their
   several parts, applying different names to them at different times:
   calling the sowing of the corn, for instance, Osiris (hence they say,
   that in the mysteries, on the finding of the members of his body, or
   the fruits, Isis is thus addressed: We have found, we wish thee joy),
   the fruit of the vine Dionysus, the vine itself Semelé, the heat of the
   sun the thunderbolt. And yet, in fact, they who refer the fables to
   actual gods, do anything rather than add to their divine character; for
   they do not perceive, that by the very defence they make for the gods,
   they confirm the things which are alleged concerning them. What have
   Europa, and the bull, and the swan, and Leda, to do with the earth and
   air, that the abominable intercourse of Zeus with them should be taken
   for the intercourse of the earth and air? But missing to discover the
   greatness of God, and not being able to rise on high with their reason
   (for they have no affinity for the heavenly place), they pine away
   among the forms of matter, and rooted to the earth, deify the changes
   of the elements: just as if any one should put the ship he sailed in
   the place of the steersman. But as the ship, although equipped with
   everything, is of no use if it have not a steersman, so neither are the
   elements, though arranged in perfect order, of any service apart from
   the providence of God. For the ship will not sail of itself; and the
   elements without their Framer will not move.

      Chapter XXIII.--Opinions of Thales and Plato.

   You may say, however, since you excel all men in understanding, How
   comes it to pass, then, that some of the idols manifest power, if those
   to whom we erect the statues are not gods? For it is not likely that
   images destitute of life and motion can of themselves do anything
   without a mover. That in various places, cities, and nations, certain
   effects are brought about in the name of idols, we are far from
   denying. None the more, however, if some have received benefit, and
   others, on the contrary, suffered harm, shall we deem those to be gods
   who have produced the effects in either case. But I have made careful
   inquiry, both why it is that you think the idols to have this power,
   and who they are that, usurping their names, produce the effects. It is
   necessary for me, however, in attempting to show who they are that
   produce the effects ascribed to the idols, and that they are not gods,
   to have recourse to some witnesses from among the philosophers. First
   Thales, as those who have accurately examined his opinions report,
   divides [superior beings] into God, demons, and heroes. God he
   recognises as the Intelligence (nous) of the world; by demons he
   understands beings possessed of soul (psuchikai); and by heroes the
   separated souls of men, the good being the good souls, and the bad the
   worthless. Plato again, while withholding his assent on other points,
   also divides [superior beings] into the uncreated God and those
   produced by the uncreated One for the adornment of heaven, the planets,
   and the fixed stars, and into demons; concerning which demons, while he
   does not think fit to speak himself, he thinks that those ought to be
   listened to who have spoken about them. "To speak concerning the other
   demons, and to know their origin, is beyond our powers; but we ought to
   believe those who have before spoken, the descendants of gods, as they
   say--and surely they must be well acquainted with their own ancestors:
   it is impossible, therefore, to disbelieve the sons of gods, even
   though they speak without probable or convincing proofs; but as they
   profess to tell of their own family affairs, we are bound, in pursuance
   of custom, to believe them. In this way, then, let us hold and speak as
   they do concerning the origin of the gods themselves. Of Gê and Ouranos
   were born Oceanus and Tethys; and of these Phorcus, Kronos, and Rhea,
   and the rest; and of Kronos and Rhea, Zeus, Hera, and all the others,
   who, we know, are all called their brothers; besides other descendants
   again of these." [783] Did, then, he who had contemplated the eternal
   Intelligence and God who is apprehended by reason, and declared His
   attributes--His real existence, the simplicity of His nature, the good
   that flows forth from Him that is truth, and discoursed of primal
   power, and how "all things are about the King of all, and all things
   exist for His sake, and He is the cause of all;" and about two and
   three, that He is "the second moving about the seconds, and the third
   about the thirds;" [784] --did this man think, that to learn the truth
   concerning those who are said to have been produced from sensible
   things, namely earth and heaven, was a task transcending his powers? It
   is not to be believed for a moment. But because he thought it
   impossible to believe that gods beget and are brought forth, since
   everything that begins to be is followed by an end, and (for this is
   much more difficult) to change the views of the multitude, who receive
   the fables without examination, on this account it was that he declared
   it to be beyond his powers to know and to speak concerning the origin
   of the other demons, since he was unable either to admit or teach that
   gods were begotten. And as regards that saying of his, "The great
   sovereign in heaven, Zeus, driving a winged car, advances first,
   ordering and managing all things, and there follow him a host of gods
   and demons," [785] this does not refer to the Zeus who is said to have
   sprung from Kronos; for here the name is given to the Maker of the
   universe. This is shown by Plato himself: not being able to designate
   Him by another title that should be suitable, he availed himself of the
   popular name, not as peculiar to God, but for distinctness, because it
   is not possible to discourse of God to all men as fully as one might;
   and he adds at the same time the epithet "Great," so as to distinguish
   the heavenly from the earthly, the uncreated from the created, who is
   younger than heaven and earth, and younger than the Cretans, who stole
   him away, that he might not be killed by his father.

      Chapter XXIV.--Concerning the Angels and Giants.

   What need is there, in speaking to you who have searched into every
   department of knowledge, to mention the poets, or to examine opinions
   of another kind? Let it suffice to say thus much. If the poets and
   philosophers did not acknowledge that there is one God, and concerning
   these gods were not of opinion, some that they are demons, others that
   they are matter, and others that they once were men,--there might be
   some show of reason for our being harassed as we are, since we employ
   language which makes a distinction between God and matter, and the
   natures of the two. For, as we acknowledge a God, and a Son his Logos,
   and a Holy Spirit, united in essence,--the Father, the Son, the Spirit,
   because the Son is the Intelligence, Reason, Wisdom of the Father, and
   the Spirit an effluence, as light from fire; so also do we apprehend
   the existence of other powers, which exercise dominion about matter,
   and by means of it, and one in particular, which is hostile to God: not
   that anything is really opposed to God, like strife to friendship,
   according to Empedocles, and night to day, according to the appearing
   and disappearing of the stars (for even if anything had placed itself
   in opposition to God, it would have ceased to exist, its structure
   being destroyed by the power and might of God), but that to the good
   that is in God, which belongs of necessity to Him, and co-exists with
   Him, as colour with body, without which it has no existence (not as
   being part of it, but as an attendant property co-existing with it,
   united and blended, just as it is natural for fire to be yellow and the
   ether dark blue),--to the good that is in God, I say, the spirit which
   is about matter, [786] who was created by God, just as the other angels
   were created by Him, and entrusted with the control of matter and the
   forms of matter, is opposed. For this is the office of the angels,--to
   exercise providence for God over the things created and ordered by Him;
   so that God may have the universal and general providence of the whole,
   while the particular parts are provided for by the angels appointed
   over them. [787] Just as with men, who have freedom of choice as to
   both virtue and vice (for you would not either honour the good or
   punish the bad, unless vice and virtue were in their own power; and
   some are diligent in the matters entrusted to them by you, and others
   faithless), so is it among the angels. Some, free agents, you will
   observe, such as they were created by God, continued in those things
   for which God had made and over which He had ordained them; but some
   outraged both the constitution of their nature and the government
   entrusted to them: namely, this ruler of matter and its various forms,
   and others of those who were placed about this first firmament (you
   know that we say nothing without witnesses, but state the things which
   have been declared by the prophets); these fell into impure love of
   virgins, and were subjugated by the flesh, and he became negligent and
   wicked in the management of the things entrusted to him. Of these
   lovers of virgins, therefore, were begotten those who are called
   giants. [788] And if something has been said by the poets, too, about
   the giants, be not surprised at this: worldly wisdom and divine differ
   as much from each other as truth and plausibility: the one is of heaven
   and the other of earth; and indeed, according to the prince of
   matter,--


   "We know we oft speak lies that look like truths." [789]

      Chapter XXV.--The Poets and Philosophers Have Denied a Divine Providence.

   These angels, then, who have fallen from heaven, and haunt the air and
   the earth, and are no longer able to rise to heavenly things, and the
   souls of the giants, which are the demons who wander about the world,
   perform actions similar, the one (that is, the demons) to the natures
   they have received, the other (that is, the angels) to the appetites
   they have indulged. But the prince of matter, as may be seen merely
   from what transpires, exercises a control and management contrary to
   the good that is in God:--


   "Ofttimes this anxious thought has crossed my mind,

   Whether 'tis chance or deity that rules

   The small affairs of men; and, spite of hope

   As well as justice, drives to exile some

   Stripped of all means of life, while others still

   Continue to enjoy prosperity." [790]

   Prosperity and adversity, contrary to hope and justice, made it
   impossible for Euripides to say to whom belongs the administration of
   earthly affairs, which is of such a kind that one might say of it:--


   "How then, while seeing these things, can we say

   There is a race of gods, or yield to laws?" [791]

   The same thing led Aristotle to say that the things below the heaven
   are not under the care of Providence, although the eternal providence
   of God concerns itself equally with us below,--


   "The earth, let willingness move her or not,

   Must herbs produce, and thus sustain my flocks," [792] --

   and addresses itself to the deserving individually, according to truth
   and not according to opinion; and all other things, according to the
   general constitution of nature, are provided for by the law of reason.
   But because the demoniac movements and operations proceeding from the
   adverse spirit produce these disorderly sallies, and moreover move men,
   some in one way and some in another, as individuals and as nations,
   separately and in common, in accordance with the tendency of matter on
   the one hand, and of the affinity for divine things on the other, from
   within and from without,--some who are of no mean reputation have
   therefore thought that this universe is constituted without any
   definite order, and is driven hither and thither by an irrational
   chance. But they do not understand, that of those things which belong
   to the constitution of the whole world there is nothing out of order or
   neglected, but that each one of them has been produced by reason, and
   that, therefore, they do not transgress the order prescribed to them;
   and that man himself, too, so far as He that made him is concerned, is
   well ordered, both by his original nature, which has one common
   character for all, and by the constitution of his body, which does not
   transgress the law imposed upon it, and by the termination of his life,
   which remains equal and common to all alike; [793] but that, according
   to the character peculiar to himself and the operation of the ruling
   prince and of the demons his followers, he is impelled and moved in
   this direction or in that, notwithstanding that all possess in common
   the same original constitution of mind. [794]

      Chapter XXVI.--The Demons Allure Men to the Worship of Images.

   They who draw men to idols, then, are the aforesaid demons, who are
   eager for the blood of the sacrifices, and lick them; but the gods that
   please the multitude, and whose names are given to the images, were
   men, as may be learned from their history. And that it is the demons
   who act under their names, is proved by the nature of their operations.
   For some castrate, as Rhea; others wound and slaughter, as Artemis; the
   Tauric goddess puts all strangers to death. I pass over those who
   lacerate with knives and scourges of bones, and shall not attempt to
   describe all the kinds of demons; for it is not the part of a god to
   incite to things against nature.


   "But when the demon plots against a man,

   He first inflicts some hurt upon his mind." [795]

   But God, being perfectly good, is eternally doing good. That, moreover,
   those who exert the power are not the same as those to whom the statues
   are erected, very strong evidence is afforded by Troas and Parium. The
   one has statues of Neryllinus, a man of our own times; and Parium of
   Alexander and Proteus: both the sepulchre and the statue of Alexander
   are still in the forum. The other statues of Neryllinus, then, are a
   public ornament, if indeed a city can be adorned by such objects as
   these; but one of them is supposed to utter oracles and to heal the
   sick, and on this account the people of the Troad offer sacrifices to
   this statue, and overlay it with gold, and hang chaplets upon it. But
   of the statues of Alexander and Proteus (the latter, you are aware,
   threw himself into the fire near Olympia), that of Proteus is likewise
   said to utter oracles; and to that of Alexander--


   "Wretched Paris, though in form so fair,

   Thou slave of woman" [796] --

   sacrifices are offered and festivals are held at the public cost, as to
   a god who can hear. Is it, then, Neryllinus, and Proteus, and Alexander
   who exert these energies in connection with the statues, or is it the
   nature of the matter itself? But the matter is brass. And what can
   brass do of itself, which may be made again into a different form, as
   Amasis treated the footpan, [797] as told by Herodotus? And Neryllinus,
   and Proteus, and Alexander, what good are they to the sick? For what
   the image is said now to effect, it effected when Neryllinus was alive
   and sick.

      Chapter XXVII.--Artifices of the Demons.

   What then? In the first place, the irrational and fantastic movements
   of the soul about opinions produce a diversity of images (eidola) from
   time to time: some they derive from matter, and some they fashion and
   bring forth for themselves; and this happens to a soul especially when
   it partakes of the material spirit [798] and becomes mingled with it,
   looking not at heavenly things and their Maker, but downwards to
   earthly things, wholly at the earth, as being now mere flesh and blood,
   and no longer pure spirit. [799] These irrational and fantastic
   movements of the soul, then, give birth to empty visions in the mind,
   by which it becomes madly set on idols. When, too, a tender and
   susceptible soul, which has no knowledge or experience of sounder
   doctrines, and is unaccustomed to contemplate truth, and to consider
   thoughtfully the Father and Maker of all things, gets impressed with
   false opinions respecting itself, then the demons who hover about
   matter, greedy of sacrificial odours and the blood of victims, and ever
   ready to lead men into error, avail themselves of these delusive
   movements of the souls of the multitude; and, taking possession of
   their thoughts, cause to flow into the mind empty visions as if coming
   from the idols and the statues; and when, too, a soul of itself, as
   being immortal, [800] moves comformably to reason, either predicting
   the future or healing the present, the demons claim the glory for
   themselves.

      Chapter XXVIII.--The Heathen Gods Were Simply Men.

   But it is perhaps necessary, in accordance with what has already been
   adduced, to say a little about their names. Herodotus, then, and
   Alexander the son of Philip, in his letter to his mother (and each of
   them is said to have conversed with the priests at Heliopolis, and
   Memphis, and Thebes), affirm that they learnt from them that the gods
   had been men. Herodotus speaks thus: "Of such a nature were, they said,
   the beings represented by these images, they were very far indeed from
   being gods. However, in the times anterior to them it was otherwise;
   then Egypt had gods for its rulers, who dwelt upon the earth with men,
   one being always supreme above the rest. The last of these was Horus
   the son of Osiris, called by the Greeks Apollo. He deposed Typhon, and
   ruled over Egypt as its last god-king. Osiris is named Dionysus
   (Bacchus) by the Greeks." [801] "Almost all the names of the gods came
   into Greece from Egypt." [802] Apollo was the son of Dionysus and Isis,
   as Herodotus likewise affirms: "According to the Egyptians, Apollo and
   Diana are the children of Bacchus and Isis; while Latona is their nurse
   and their preserver." [803] These beings of heavenly origin they had
   for their first kings: partly from ignorance of the true worship of the
   Deity, partly from gratitude for their government, they esteemed them
   as gods together with their wives. "The male kine, if clean, and the
   male calves, are used for sacrifice by the Egyptians universally; but
   the females, they are not allowed to sacrifice, since they are sacred
   to Isis. The statue of this goddess has the form of a woman but with
   horns like a cow, resembling those of the Greek representations of Io."
   [804] And who can be more deserving of credit in making these
   statements, than those who in family succession son from father,
   received not only the priesthood, but also the history? For it is not
   likely that the priests, who make it their business to commend the
   idols to men's reverence, would assert falsely that they were men. If
   Herodotus alone had said that the Egyptians spoke in their histories of
   the gods as of men, when he says, "What they told me concerning their
   religion it is not my intention to repeat, except only the names of
   their deities, things of very trifling importance," [805] it would
   behove us not to credit even Herodotus as being a fabulist. But as
   Alexander and Hermes surnamed Trismegistus, who shares with them in the
   attribute of eternity, and innumerable others, not to name them
   individually, [declare the same], no room is left even for doubt that
   they, being kings, were esteemed gods. That they were men, the most
   learned of the Egyptians also testify, who, while saying that ether,
   earth, sun, moon, are gods, regard the rest as mortal men, and the
   temples as their sepulchres. Apollodorus, too, asserts the same thing
   in his treatise concerning the gods. But Herodotus calls even their
   sufferings mysteries. "The ceremonies at the feast of Isis in the city
   of Busiris have been already spoken of. It is there that the whole
   multitude, both of men and women, many thousands in number, beat
   themselves at the close of the sacrifice in honour of a god whose name
   a religious scruple forbids me to mention." [806] If they are gods,
   they are also immortal; but if people are beaten for them, and their
   sufferings are mysteries, they are men, as Herodotus himself says:
   "Here, too, in this same precinct of Minerva at Saïs, is the
   burial-place of one whom I think it not right to mention in such a
   connection. It stands behind the temple against the back wall, which it
   entirely covers. There are also some large stone obelisks in the
   enclosure, and there is a lake near them, adorned with an edging of
   stone. In form it is circular, and in size, as it seemed to me, about
   equal to the lake at Delos called the Hoop. On this lake it is that the
   Egyptians represent by night his sufferings whose name I refrain from
   mentioning, and this representation they call their mysteries." [807]
   And not only is the sepulchre of Osiris shown, but also his embalming:
   "When a body is brought to them, they show the bearer various models of
   corpses made in wood, and painted so as to resemble nature. The most
   perfect is said to be after the manner of him whom I do not think it
   religious to name in connection with such a matter." [808]

      Chapter XXIX.--Proof of the Same from the Poets.

   But among the Greeks, also, those who are eminent in poetry and history
   say the same thing. Thus of Heracles:--


   "That lawless wretch, that man of brutal strength,

   Deaf to Heaven's voice, the social rite transgressed." [809]

   Such being his nature, deservedly did he go mad, and deservedly did he
   light the funeral pile and burn himself to death. Of Asklepius, Hesiod
   says:--


   "The mighty father both of gods and men

   Was filled with wrath, and from Olympus' top

   With flaming thunderbolt cast down and slew

   Latona's well-lov'd son--such was his ire." [810]

   And Pindar:--


   "But even wisdom is ensnared by gain.

   The brilliant bribe of gold seen in the hand

   Ev'n him [811] perverted: therefore Kronos' son

   With both hands quickly stopp'd his vital breath,

   And by a bolt of fire ensured his doom." [812]

   Either, therefore, they were gods and did not hanker after gold--


   "O gold, the fairest prize to mortal men,

   Which neither mother equals in delight,

   Nor children dear" [813] --

   for the Deity is in want of nought, and is superior to carnal desire,
   nor did they die; or, having been born men, they were wicked by reason
   of ignorance, and overcome by love of money. What more need I say, or
   refer to Castor, or Pollux, or Amphiaraus, who, having been born, so to
   speak, only the other day, men of men, are looked upon as gods, when
   they imagine even Ino after her madness and its consequent sufferings
   to have become a goddess?


   "Sea-rovers will her name Leucothea." [814]

   And her son:--


   "August Palæmon, sailors will invoke."

      Chapter XXX.--Reasons Why Divinity Has Been Ascribed to Men.

   For if detestable and god-hated men had the reputation of being gods,
   and the daughter of Derceto, Semiramis, a lascivious and blood-stained
   woman, was esteemed a Syria goddess; and if, on account of Derceto, the
   Syrians worship doves and Semiramis (for, a thing impossible, a woman
   was changed into a dove: the story is in Ctesias), what wonder if some
   should be called gods by their people on the ground of their rule and
   sovereignty (the Sibyl, of whom Plato also makes mention, says:--


   "It was the generation then the tenth,

   Of men endow'd with speech, since forth the flood

   Had burst upon the men of former times,

   And Kronos, Japetus, and Titan reigned,

   Whom men, of Ouranos and Gaïa

   Proclaimed the noblest sons, and named them so, [815]

   Because of men endowed with gift of speech

   They were the first"); [816]

   and others for their strength, as Heracles and Perseus; and others for
   their art, as Asclepius? Those, therefore, to whom either the subjects
   gave honour or the rulers themselves [assumed it], obtained the name,
   some from fear, others from revenge. Thus Antinous, through the
   benevolence of your ancestors towards their subjects, came to be
   regarded as a god. But those who came after adopted the worship without
   examination.


   "The Cretans always lie; for they, O king,

   Have built a tomb to thee who art not dead." [817]

   Though you believe, O Callimachus, in the nativity of Zeus, you do not
   believe in his sepulchre; and whilst you think to obscure the truth,
   you in fact proclaim him dead, even to those who are ignorant; and if
   you see the cave, you call to mind the childbirth of Rhea; but when you
   see the coffin, you throw a shadow over his death, not considering that
   the unbegotten God alone is eternal. For either the tales told by the
   multitude and the poets about the gods are unworthy of credit, and the
   reverence shown them is superfluous (for those do not exist, the tales
   concerning whom are untrue); or if the births, the amours, the murders,
   the thefts, the castrations, the thunderbolts, are true, they no longer
   exist, having ceased to be since they were born, having previously had
   no being. And on what principle must we believe some things and
   disbelieve others, when the poets have written their stories in order
   to gain greater veneration for them? For surely those through whom they
   have got to be considered gods, and who have striven to represent their
   deeds as worthy of reverence, cannot have invented their sufferings.
   That, therefore, we are not atheists, acknowledging as we do God the
   Maker of this universe and His Logos, has been proved according to my
   ability, if not according to the importance of the subject.

      Chapter XXXI.--Confutation of the Other Charges Brought Against the
      Christians.

   But they have further also made up stories against us of impious feasts
   [818] and forbidden intercourse between the sexes, both that they may
   appear to themselves to have rational grounds of hatred, and because
   they think either by fear to lead us away from our way of life, or to
   render the rulers harsh and inexorable by the magnitude of the charges
   they bring. But they lose their labour with those who know that from of
   old it has been the custom, and not in our time only, for vice to make
   war on virtue. Thus Pythagoras, with three hundred others, was burnt to
   death; Heraclitus and Democritus were banished, the one from the city
   of the Ephesians, the other from Abdera, because he was charged with
   being mad; and the Athenians condemned Socrates to death. But as they
   were none the worse in respect of virtue because of the opinion of the
   multitude, so neither does the undiscriminating calumny of some persons
   cast any shade upon us as regards rectitude of life, for with God we
   stand in good repute. Nevertheless, I will meet these charges also,
   although I am well assured that by what has been already said I have
   cleared myself to you. For as you excel all men in intelligence, you
   know that those whose life is directed towards God as its rule, so that
   each one among us may be blameless and irreproachable before Him, will
   not entertain even the thought of the slightest sin. For if we believed
   that we should live only the present life, then we might be suspected
   of sinning, through being enslaved to flesh and blood, or overmastered
   by gain or carnal desire; but since we know that God is witness to what
   we think and what we say both by night and by day, and that He, being
   Himself light, sees all things in our heart, we are persuaded that when
   we are removed from the present life we shall live another life, better
   than the present one, and heavenly, not earthly (since we shall abide
   near God, and with God, free from all change or suffering in the soul,
   not as flesh, even though we shall have flesh, [819] but as heavenly
   spirit), or, falling with the rest, a worse one and in fire; for God
   has not made us as sheep or beasts of burden, a mere by-work, and that
   we should perish and be annihilated. On these grounds it is not likely
   that we should wish to do evil, or deliver ourselves over to the great
   Judge to be punished.

      Chapter XXXII.--Elevated Morality of the Christians.

   It is, however, nothing wonderful that they should get up tales about
   us such as they tell of their own gods, of the incidents of whose lives
   they make mysteries. But it behoved them, if they meant to condemn
   shameless and promiscuous intercourse, to hate either Zeus, who begat
   children of his mother Rhea and his daughter Koré, and took his own
   sister to wife, or Orpheus, the inventor of these tales, which made
   Zeus more unholy and detestable than Thyestes himself; for the latter
   defiled his daughter in pursuance of an oracle, and when he wanted to
   obtain the kingdom and avenge himself. But we are so far from
   practising promiscuous intercourse, that it is not lawful among us to
   indulge even a lustful look. "For," saith He, "he that looketh on a
   woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart."
   [820] Those, then, who are forbidden to look at anything more than that
   for which God formed the eyes, which were intended to be a light to us,
   and to whom a wanton look is adultery, the eyes being made for other
   purposes, and who are to be called to account for their very thoughts,
   how can any one doubt that such persons practice self-control? For our
   account lies not with human laws, which a bad man can evade (at the
   outset I proved to you, sovereign lords, that our doctrine is from the
   teaching of God), but we have a law which makes the measure of
   rectitude to consist in dealing with our neighbour as ourselves. [821]
   On this account, too, according to age, we recognise some as sons and
   daughters, others we regard as brothers and sisters, [822] and to the
   more advanced in life we give the honour due to fathers and mothers. On
   behalf of those, then, to whom we apply the names of brothers and
   sisters, and other designations of relationship, we exercise the
   greatest care that their bodies should remain undefiled and
   uncorrupted; for the Logos [823] again says to us, "If any one kiss a
   second time because it has given him pleasure, [he sins];" adding,
   "Therefore the kiss, or rather the salutation, should be given with the
   greatest care, since, if there be mixed with it the least defilement of
   thought, it excludes us from eternal life." [824]

      Chapter XXXIII.--Chastity of the Christians with Respect to Marriage.

   Therefore, having the hope of eternal life, we despise the things of
   this life, even to the pleasures of the soul, each of us reckoning her
   his wife whom he has married according to the laws laid down by us, and
   that only for the purpose of having children. For as the husbandman
   throwing the seed into the ground awaits the harvest, not sowing more
   upon it, so to us the procreation of children is the measure of our
   indulgence in appetite. Nay, you would find many among us, both men and
   women, growing old unmarried, in hope of living in closer communion
   with God. [825] But if the remaining in virginity and in the state of
   an eunuch brings nearer to God, while the indulgence of carnal thought
   and desire leads away from Him, in those cases in which we shun the
   thoughts, much more do we reject the deeds. For we bestow our
   attention, not on the study of words, but on the exhibition and
   teaching of actions,--that a person should either remain as he was
   born, or be content with one marriage; for a second marriage is only a
   specious adultery. [826] "For whosoever puts away his wife," says He,
   "and marries another, commits adultery;" [827] not permitting a man to
   send her away whose virginity he has brought to an end, nor to marry
   again. For he who deprives himself of his first wife, even though she
   be dead, is a cloaked adulterer, [828] resisting the hand of God,
   because in the beginning God made one man and one woman, and dissolving
   the strictest union of flesh with flesh, formed for the intercourse of
   the race.

   But though such is our character (Oh! why should I speak of things
   unfit to be uttered?), the things said of us are an example of the
   proverb, "The harlot reproves the chaste." For those who have set up a
   market for fornication and established infamous resorts for the young
   for every kind of vile pleasure,--who do not abstain even from males,
   males with males committing shocking abominations, outraging all the
   noblest and comeliest bodies in all sorts of ways, so dishonouring the
   fair workmanship of God (for beauty on earth is not self-made, but sent
   hither by the hand and will of God),--these men, I say, revile us for
   the very things which they are conscious of themselves, and ascribe to
   their own gods, boasting of them as noble deeds, and worthy of the
   gods. These adulterers and pæderasts defame the eunuchs and the
   once-married (while they themselves live like fishes; [829] for these
   gulp down whatever falls in their way, and the stronger chases the
   weaker: and, in fact, this is to feed upon human flesh, to do violence
   in contravention of the very laws which you and your ancestors, with
   due care for all that is fair and right, have enacted), so that not
   even the governors of the provinces sent by you suffice for the hearing
   of the complaints against those, to whom it even is not lawful, when
   they are struck, not to offer themselves for more blows, nor when
   defamed not to bless: for it is not enough to be just (and justice is
   to return like for like), but it is incumbent on us to be good and
   patient of evil.

      Chapter XXXV.--The Christians Condemn and Detest All Cruelty.

   What man of sound mind, therefore, will affirm, while such is our
   character, that we are murderers? For we cannot eat human flesh till we
   have killed some one. The former charge, therefore, being false, if any
   one should ask them in regard to the second, whether they have seen
   what they assert, not one of them would be so barefaced as to say that
   he had. And yet we have slaves, some more and some fewer, by whom we
   could not help being seen; but even of these, not one has been found to
   invent even such things against us. For when they know that we cannot
   endure even to see a man put to death, though justly; who of them can
   accuse us of murder or cannibalism? Who does not reckon among the
   things of greatest interest the contests of gladiators and wild beasts,
   especially those which are given by you? But we, deeming that to see a
   man put to death is much the same as killing him, have abjured such
   spectacles. [830] How, then, when we do not even look on, lest we
   should contract guilt and pollution, can we put people to death? And
   when we say that those women who use drugs to bring on abortion commit
   murder, and will have to give an account to God [831] for the abortion,
   on what principle should we commit murder? For it does not belong to
   the same person to regard the very foetus in the womb as a created
   being, and therefore an object of God's care, and when it has passed
   into life, to kill it; and not to expose an infant, because those who
   expose them are chargeable with child-murder, and on the other hand,
   when it has been reared to destroy it. But we are in all things always
   alike and the same, submitting ourselves to reason, and not ruling over
   it.

   what the Gospel abolished, with no help from them. He says, "the first

      Chapter XXXVI.--Bearing of the Doctrine of the Resurrection on the
      Practices of the Christians.

   Who, then, that believes in a resurrection, would make himself into a
   tomb for bodies that will rise again? For it is not the part of the
   same persons to believe that our bodies will rise again, and to eat
   them as if they would not; and to think that the earth will give back
   the bodies held by it, but that those which a man has entombed in
   himself will not be demanded back. On the contrary, it is reasonable to
   suppose, that those who think they shall have no account to give of the
   present life, ill or well spent, and that there is no resurrection, but
   calculate on the soul perishing with the body, and being as it were
   quenched in it, will refrain from no deed of daring; but as for those
   who are persuaded that nothing will escape the scrutiny of God, but
   that even the body which has ministered to the irrational impulses of
   the soul, and to its desires, will be punished along with it, it is not
   likely that they will commit even the smallest sin. But if to any one
   it appears sheer nonsense that the body which has mouldered away, and
   been dissolved, and reduced to nothing, should be reconstructed, we
   certainly cannot with any reason be accused of wickedness with
   reference to those that believe not, but only of folly; for with the
   opinions by which we deceive ourselves we injure no one else. But that
   it is not our belief alone that bodies will rise again, but that many
   philosophers also hold the same view, it is out of place to show just
   now, lest we should be thought to introduce topics irrelevant to the
   matter in hand, either by speaking of the intelligible and the
   sensible, and the nature of these respectively, or by contending that
   the incorporeal is older than the corporeal, and that the intelligible
   precedes the sensible, although we become acquainted with the latter
   earliest, since the corporeal is formed from the incorporeal, by the
   combination with it of the intelligible, and that the sensible is
   formed from the intelligible; for nothing hinders, according to
   Pythagoras and Plato, that when the dissolution of bodies takes place,
   they should, from the very same elements of which they were constructed
   at first, be constructed again. [832] But let us defer the discourse
   concerning the resurrection. [833]

      Chapter I.--Defence of the Truth Should Precede Discussions Regarding It.
      [835]

   By the side of every opinion and doctrine which agrees with the truth
   of things, there springs up some falsehood; and it does so, not because
   it takes its rise naturally from some fundamental principle, or from
   some cause peculiar to the matter in hand, but because it is invented
   on purpose by men who set a value on the spurious seed, for its
   tendency to corrupt the truth. This is apparent, in the first place,
   from those who in former times addicted themselves to such inquiries,
   and their want of agreement with their predecessors and contemporaries,
   and then, not least, from the very confusion which marks the
   discussions that are now going on. For such men have left no truth free
   from their calumnious attacks--not the being of God, not His knowledge,
   not His operations, not those books which follow by a regular and
   strict sequence from these, and delineate for us the doctrines of
   piety. On the contrary, some of them utterly, and once for all, give up
   in despair the truth concerning these things, and some distort it to
   suit their own views, and some of set purpose doubt even of things
   which are palpably evident. Hence I think that those who bestow
   attention on such subjects should adopt two lines of argument, one in
   defence of the truth, another concerning the truth: that in defence of
   the truth, for disbelievers and doubters; that concerning the truth,
   for such as are candid and receive the truth with readiness.
   Accordingly it behoves those who wish to investigate these matters, to
   keep in view that which the necessity of the case in each instance
   requires, and to regulate their discussion by this; to accommodate the
   order of their treatment of these subjects to what is suitable to the
   occasion, and not for the sake of appearing always to preserve the same
   method, to disregard fitness and the place which properly belongs to
   each topic. For, so far as proof and the natural order are concerned,
   dissertations concerning the truth always take precedence of those in
   defence of it; but, for the purpose of greater utility, the order must
   be reversed, and arguments in defence of it precede those concerning
   it. For the farmer could not properly cast the seed into the ground,
   unless he first extirpated the wild wood, and whatever would be hurtful
   to the good seed; nor the physician introduce any wholesome medicines
   into the body that needed his care, if he did not previously remove the
   disease within, or stay that which was approaching. Neither surely can
   he who wishes to teach the truth persuade any one by speaking about it,
   so long as there is a false opinion lurking in the mind of his hearers,
   and barring the entrance of his arguments. And, therefore, from regard
   to greater utility, I myself sometimes place arguments in defence of
   the truth before those concerning the truth; and on the present
   occasion it appears to me, looking at the requirements of the case, not
   without advantage to follow the same method in treating of the
   resurrection. For in regard to this subject also we find some utterly
   disbelieving, and some others doubting, and even among those who have
   accepted the first principles some who are as much at a loss what to
   believe as those who doubt; the most unaccountable thing of all being,
   that they are in this state of mind without having any ground
   whatsoever in the matters themselves for their disbelief, or finding it
   possible to assign any reasonable cause why they disbelieve or
   experience any perplexity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [835] [This argument was adapted to the times, and to those to whom it
   was addressed, with great rhetorical art and concealment of art. Its
   faults arise from the defective science of the age, and from the habits
   of thought and of public instruction then in fashion. He does not
   address himself to believers, but to sceptics, and meets them on their
   highest levels of speech and of reason.]
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter II.--A Resurrection is Not Impossible.

   Let us, then, consider the subject in the way I have indicated. If all
   disbelief does not arise from levity and inconsideration, but if it
   springs up in some minds on strong grounds and accompanied by the
   certainty which belongs to truth [well and good]; for it then maintains
   the appearance of being just, when the thing itself to which their
   disbelief relates appears to them unworthy of belief; but to disbelieve
   things which are not deserving of disbelief, is the act of men who do
   not employ a sound judgment about the truth. It behoves, therefore,
   those who disbelieve or doubt concerning the resurrection, to form
   their opinion on the subject, not from any view they have hastily
   adopted, and from what is acceptable to profligate men, but either to
   assign the origin of men to no cause (a notion which is very easily
   refuted), or, ascribing the cause of all things to God, to keep
   steadily in view the principle involved in this article of belief, and
   from this to demonstrate that the resurrection is utterly unworthy of
   credit. This they will succeed in, if they are able to show that it is
   either impossible for God, or contrary to His will, to unite and gather
   together again bodies that are dead, or even entirely dissolved into
   their elements, so as to constitute the same persons. If they cannot do
   this, let them cease from this godless disbelief, and from this
   blasphemy against sacred things: for, that they do not speak the truth
   when they say that it is impossible, or not in accordance with the
   divine will, will clearly appear from what I am about to say. A thing
   is in strictness of language considered impossible to a person, when it
   is of such a kind that he either does not know what is to be done, or
   has not sufficient power for the proper doing of the thing known. For
   he who is ignorant of anything that requires to be done, is utterly
   unable either to attempt or to do what he is ignorant of; and he, too,
   who knows ever so well what has to be done, and by what means, and how,
   but either has no power at all to do the thing known, or not power
   sufficient, will not even make the attempt, if he be wise and consider
   his powers; and if he did attempt it without due consideration, he
   would not accomplish his purpose. But it is not possible for God to be
   ignorant, either of the nature of the bodies that are to be raised, as
   regards both the members entire and the particles of which they
   consist, or whither each of the dissolved particles passes, and what
   part of the elements has received that which is dissolved and has
   passed into that with which it has affinity, although to men it may
   appear quite impossible that what has again combined according to its
   nature with the universe should be separable from it again. For He from
   whom, antecedently to the peculiar formation of each, was not concealed
   either the nature of the elements of which the bodies of men were to
   consist, or the parts of these from which He was about to take what
   seemed to Him suitable for the formation of the human body, will
   manifestly, after the dissolution of the whole, not be ignorant whither
   each of the particles has passed which He took for the construction of
   each. For, viewed relatively to the order of things now obtaining among
   us, and the judgment we form concerning other matters, it is a greater
   thing to know beforehand that which has not yet come to pass; but,
   viewed relatively to the majesty and wisdom of God, both are according
   to nature, and it is equally easy to know beforehand things that have
   not yet come into existence, and to know things which have been
   dissolved.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter III.--He Who Could Create, Can Also Raise Up the Dead.

   Moreover also, that His power is sufficient for the raising of dead
   bodies, is shown by the creation of these same bodies. For if, when
   they did not exist, He made at their first formation the bodies of men,
   and their original elements, He will, when they are dissolved, in
   whatever manner that may take place, raise them again with equal ease:
   for this, too, is equally possible to Him. And it is no damage to the
   argument, if some suppose the first beginnings to be from matter, or
   the bodies of men at least to be derived from the elements as the first
   materials, or from seed. For that power which could give shape to what
   is regarded by them as shapeless matter, and adorn it, when destitute
   of form and order, with many and diverse forms, and gather into one the
   several portions of the elements, and divide the seed which was one and
   simple into many, and organize that which was unorganized, and give
   life to that which had no life,--that same power can reunite what is
   dissolved, and raise up what is prostrate, and restore the dead to life
   again, and put the corruptible into a state of incorruption. And to the
   same Being it will belong, and to the same power and skill, to separate
   that which has been broken up and distributed among a multitude of
   animals of all kinds which are wont to have recourse to such bodies,
   and glut their appetite upon them,--to separate this, I say, and unite
   it again with the proper members and parts of members, whether it has
   passed into some one of those animals, or into many, or thence into
   others, or, after being dissolved along with these, has been carried
   back again to the original elements, resolved into these according to a
   natural law--a matter this which seems to have exceedingly confounded
   some, even of those admired for wisdom, who, I cannot tell why, think
   those doubts worthy of serious attention which are brought forward by
   the many.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter IV.--Objection from the Fact that Some Human Bodies Have Become
      Part of Others.

   These persons, to wit, say that many bodies of those who have come to
   an unhappy death in shipwrecks and rivers have become food for fishes,
   and many of those who perish in war, or who from some other sad cause
   or state of things are deprived of burial, lie exposed to become the
   food of any animals which may chance to light upon them. Since, then,
   bodies are thus consumed, and the members and parts composing them are
   broken up and distributed among a great multitude of animals, and by
   means of nutrition become incorporated with the bodies of those that
   are nourished by them,--in the first place, they say, their separation
   from these is impossible; and besides this, in the second place, they
   adduce another circumstance more difficult still. When animals of the
   kind suitable for human food, which have fed on the bodies of men, pass
   through their stomach, and become incorporated with the bodies of those
   who have partaken of them, it is an absolute necessity, they say, that
   the parts of the bodies of men which have served as nourishment to the
   animals which have partaken of them should pass into other bodies of
   men, since the animals which meanwhile have been nourished by them
   convey the nutriment derived from those by whom they were nourished
   into those men of whom they become the nutriment. Then to this they
   tragically add the devouring of offspring perpetrated by people in
   famine and madness, and the children eaten by their own parents through
   the contrivance of enemies, and the celebrated Median feast, and the
   tragic banquet of Thyestes; and they add, moreover, other such like
   unheard-of occurrences which have taken place among Greeks and
   barbarians: and from these things they establish, as they suppose, the
   impossibility of the resurrection, on the ground that the same parts
   cannot rise again with one set of bodies, and with another as well; for
   that either the bodies of the former possessors cannot be
   reconstituted, the parts which composed them having passed into others,
   or that, these having been restored to the former, the bodies of the
   last possessors will come short.

      Chapter V.--Reference to the Processes of Digestion and Nutrition.

   But it appears to me that such persons, in the first place, are
   ignorant of the power and skill of Him that fashioned and regulates
   this universe, who has adapted to the nature and kind of each animal
   the nourishment suitable and correspondent to it, and has neither
   ordained that everything in nature shall enter into union and
   combination with every kind of body, nor is at any loss to separate
   what has been so united, but grants to the nature of each several
   created being or thing to do or to suffer what is naturally suited to
   it, and sometimes also hinders and allows or forbids whatever He
   wishes, and for the purpose He wishes; and, moreover, that they have
   not considered the power and nature of each of the creatures that
   nourish or are nourished. Otherwise they would have known that not
   everything which is taken for food under the pressure of outward
   necessity turns out to be suitable nourishment for the animal, but that
   some things no sooner come into contact with the plicatures of the
   stomach than they are wont to be corrupted, and are vomited or voided,
   or disposed of in some other way, so that not even for a little time do
   they undergo the first and natural digestion, much less become
   incorporated with that which is to be nourished; as also, that not even
   everything which has been digested in the stomach and received the
   first change actually arrives at the parts to be nourished, since some
   of it loses its nutritive power even in the stomach, and some during
   the second change, and the digestion that takes place in the liver is
   separated and passes into something else which is destitute of the
   power to nourish; nay, that the change which takes place in the liver
   does not all issue in nourishment to men, but the matter changed is
   separated as refuse according to its natural purpose; and that the
   nourishment which is left in the members and parts themselves that have
   to be nourished sometimes changes to something else, according as that
   predominates which is present in greater or less [836] abundance, and
   is apt to corrupt or to turn into itself that which comes near it.

      Chapter VI.--Everything that is Useless or Hurtful is Rejected.

   Since, therefore, great difference of nature obtains in all animals,
   and the very nourishment which is accordant with nature is varied to
   suit each kind of animal, and the body which is nourished; and as in
   the nourishment of every animal there is a threefold cleansing and
   separation, it follows that whatever is alien from the nourishment of
   the animal must be wholly destroyed and carried off to its natural
   place, or change into something else, since it cannot coalesce with it;
   that the power of the nourishing body must be suitable to the nature of
   the animal to be nourished, and accordant with its powers; and that
   this, when it has passed through the strainers appointed for the
   purpose, and been thoroughly purified by the natural means of
   purification, must become a most genuine addition to the
   substance,--the only thing, in fact, which any one calling things by
   their right names would call nourishment at all; because it rejects
   everything that is foreign and hurtful to the constitution of the
   animal nourished and that mass of superfluous food introduced merely
   for filling the stomach and gratifying the appetite. This nourishment,
   no one can doubt, becomes incorporated with the body that is nourished,
   interwoven and blended with all the members and parts of members; but
   that which is different and contrary to nature is speedily corrupted if
   brought into contact with a stronger power, but easily destroys that
   which is overcome by it, and is converted into hurtful humours and
   poisonous qualities, because producing nothing akin or friendly to the
   body which is to be nourished. And it is a very clear proof of this,
   that in many of the animals nourished, pain, or disease, or death
   follows from these things, if, owing to a too keen appetite, they take
   in mingled with their food something poisonous and contrary to nature;
   which, of course, would tend to the utter destruction of the body to be
   nourished, since that which is nourished is nourished by substances
   akin to it and which accord with its nature, but is destroyed by those
   of a contrary kind. If, therefore, according to the different nature of
   animals, different kinds of food have been provided suitable to their
   nature, and none of that which the animal may have taken, not even an
   accidental part of it, admits of being blended with the body which is
   nourished, but only that part which has been purified by an entire
   digestion, and undergone a complete change for union with a particular
   body, and adapted to the parts which are to receive nourishment,--it is
   very plain that none of the things contrary to nature can be united
   with those bodies for which it is not a suitable and correspondent
   nourishment, but either passes off by the bowels before it produces
   some other humour, crude and corrupted; or, if it continue for a longer
   time, produces suffering or disease hard to cure, destroying at the
   same time the natural nourishment, or even the flesh itself which needs
   nourishment. But even though it be expelled at length, overcome by
   certain medicines, or by better food, or by the natural forces, it is
   not got rid of without doing much harm, since it bears no peaceful
   aspect towards what is natural, because it cannot coalesce with nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter VII.--The Resurrection-Body Different from the Present.

   Nay, suppose we were to grant that the nourishment coming from these
   things (let it be so called, as more accordant with the common way of
   speaking), although against nature, is yet separated and changed into
   some one of the moist or dry, or warm or cold, matters which the body
   contains, our opponents would gain nothing by the concession: for the
   bodies that rise again are reconstituted from the parts which properly
   belong to them, whereas no one of the things mentioned is such a part,
   nor has it the form or place of a part; nay, it does not remain always
   with the parts of the body which are nourished, or rise again with the
   parts that rise, since no longer does blood, or phlegm, or bile, or
   breath, contribute anything to the life. Neither, again, will the
   bodies nourished then require the things they once required, seeing
   that, along with the want and corruption of the bodies nourished, the
   need also of those things by which they were nourished is taken away.
   To this must be added, that if we were to suppose the change arising
   from such nourishment to reach as far as flesh, in that case too there
   would be no necessity that the flesh recently changed by food of that
   kind, if it became united to the body of some other man, should again
   as a part contribute to the formation of that body, since neither the
   flesh which takes it up always retains what it takes, nor does the
   flesh so incorporated abide and remain with that to which it was added,
   but is subject to a great variety of changes,--at one time being
   dispersed by toil or care, at another time being wasted by grief or
   trouble or disease, and by the distempers arising from being heated or
   chilled, the humours which are changed with the flesh and fat not
   receiving the nourishment so as to remain what they are. But while such
   are the changes to which the flesh is subject, we should find that
   flesh, nourished by food unsuited to it, suffers them in a much greater
   degree; now swelling out and growing fat by what it has received, and
   then again rejecting it in some way or other, and decreasing in bulk,
   from one or more of the causes already mentioned; and that that alone
   remains in the parts which is adapted to bind together, or cover, or
   warm the flesh that has been chosen by nature, and adheres to those
   parts by which it sustains the life which is according to nature, and
   fulfils the labours of that life. So that whether the investigation in
   which we have just been engaged be fairly judged of, or the objections
   urged against our position be conceded, in neither case can it be shown
   that what is said by our opponents is true, nor can the bodies of men
   ever combine with those of the same nature, whether at any time,
   through ignorance and being cheated of their perception by some one
   else, men have partaken of such a body, or of their own accord,
   impelled by want or madness, they have defiled themselves with the body
   of one of like form; for we are very well aware that some brutes have
   human forms, or have a nature compounded of men and brutes, such as the
   more daring of the poets are accustomed to represent.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter VIII.--Human Flesh Not the Proper or Natural Food of Men.

   But what need is there to speak of bodies not allotted to be the food
   of any animal, and destined only for a burial in the earth in honour of
   nature, since the Maker of the world has not alloted any animal
   whatsoever as food to those of the same kind, although some others of a
   different kind serve for food according to nature? If, indeed, they are
   able to show that the flesh of men was alloted to men for food, there
   will be nothing to hinder its being according to nature that they
   should eat one another, just like anything else that is allowed by
   nature, and nothing to prohibit those who dare to say such things from
   regaling themselves with the bodies of their dearest friends as
   delicacies, as being especially suited to them, and to entertain their
   living friends with the same fare. But if it be unlawful even to speak
   of this, and if for men to partake of the flesh of men is a thing most
   hateful and abominable, and more detestable than any other unlawful and
   unnatural food or act; and if what is against nature can never pass
   into nourishment for the limbs and parts requiring it, and what does
   not pass into nourishment can never become united with that which it is
   not adapted to nourish,--then can the bodies of men never combine with
   bodies like themselves, to which this nourishment would be against
   nature, even though it were to pass many times through their stomach,
   owing to some most bitter mischance; but, removed from the influence of
   the nourishing power, and scattered to those parts of the universe
   again from which they obtained their first origin, they are united with
   these for as long a period of time as may be the lot of each; and,
   separated thence again by the skill and power of Him who has fixed the
   nature of every animal, and furnished it with its peculiar powers, they
   are united suitably, each to each, whether they have been burnt up by
   fire, or rotted by water, or consumed by wild beasts, or by any other
   animals, or separated from the entire body and dissolved before the
   other parts; and, being again united with one another, they occupy the
   same place for the exact construction and formation of the same body,
   and for the resurrection and life of that which was dead, or even
   entirely dissolved. To expatiate further, however, on these topics, is
   not suitable; for all men are agreed in their decision respecting
   them,--those at least who are not half brutes.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter IX.--Absurdity of Arguing from Man's Impotency.

   As there are many things of more importance to the inquiry before us, I
   beg to be excused from replying for the present to those who take
   refuge in the works of men, and even the constructors of them, who are
   unable to make anew such of their works as are broken in pieces, or
   worn out by time, or otherwise destroyed, and then from the analogy of
   potters and carpenters attempt to show that God neither can will, nor
   if He willed would be able, to raise again a body that is dead, or has
   been dissolved,--not considering that by such reasoning they offer the
   grossest insult to God, putting, as they do, on the same level the
   capabilities of things which are altogether different, or rather the
   natures of those who use them, and comparing the works of art with
   those of nature. To bestow any serious attention on such arguments
   would be not undeserving of censure, for it is really foolish to reply
   to superficial and trifling objections. It is surely far more probable,
   yea, most absolutely true, to say that what is impossible with men is
   possible with God. And if by this statement of itself as probable, and
   by the whole investigation in which we have just been engaged reason
   shows it to be possible, it is quite clear that it is not impossible.
   No, nor is it such a thing as God could not will.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter X.--It Cannot Be Shown that God Does Not Will a Resurrection.

   For that which is not accordant with His will is so either as being
   unjust or as unworthy of Him. And again, the injustice regards either
   him who is to rise again, or some other than he. But it is evident that
   no one of the beings exterior to him, and that are reckoned among the
   things that have existence, is injured. Spiritual natures (noetai
   phuseis) cannot be injured by the resurrection of men, for the
   resurrection of men is no hindrance to their existing, nor is any loss
   or violence inflicted on them by it; nor, again, would the nature of
   irrational or inanimate beings sustain wrong, for they will have no
   existence after the resurrection, and no wrong can be done to that
   which is not. But even if any one should suppose them to exist for
   ever, they would not suffer wrong by the renewal of human bodies: for
   if now, in being subservient to the nature of men and their necessities
   while they require them, and subjected to the yoke and every kind of
   drudgery, they suffer no wrong, much more, when men have become
   immortal and free from want, and no longer need their service, and when
   they are themselves liberated from bondage, will they suffer no wrong.
   For if they had the gift of speech, they would not bring against the
   Creator the charge of making them, contrary to justice, inferior to men
   because they did not share in the same resurrection. For to creatures
   whose nature is not alike the Just Being does not assign a like end.
   And, besides, with creatures that have no notion of justice there can
   be no complaint of injustice. Nor can it be said either that there is
   any injustice done as regards the man to be raised, for he consists of
   soul and body, and he suffers no wrong as to either soul or body. No
   person in his senses will affirm that his soul suffers wrong, because,
   in speaking so, he would at the same time be unawares reflecting on the
   present life also; for if now, while dwelling in a body subject to
   corruption and suffering, it has had no wrong done to it, much less
   will it suffer wrong when living in conjunction with a body which is
   free from corruption and suffering. The body, again, suffers no wrong;
   for if no wrong is done to it now while united a corruptible thing with
   an incorruptible, manifestly will it not be wronged when united an
   incorruptible with an incorruptible. No; nor can any one say that it is
   a work unworthy of God to raise up and bring together again a body
   which has been dissolved: for if the worse was not unworthy of Him,
   namely, to make the body which is subject to corruption and suffering,
   much more is the better not unworthy, to make one not liable to
   corruption or suffering.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XI.--Recapitulation.

   If, then, by means of that which is by nature first and that which
   follows from it, each of the points investigated has been proved, it is
   very evident that the resurrection of dissolved bodies is a work which
   the Creator can perform, and can will, and such as is worthy of Him:
   for by these considerations the falsehood of the contrary opinion has
   been shown, and the absurdity of the position taken by disbelievers.
   For why should I speak of their correspondence each with each, and of
   their connection with one another? If indeed we ought to use the word
   connection, as though they were separated by some difference of nature;
   and not rather say, that what God can do He can also will, and that
   what God can will it is perfectly possible for Him to do, and that it
   is accordant with the dignity of Him who wills it. That to discourse
   concerning the truth is one thing, and to discourse in defence of it is
   another, has been sufficiently explained in the remarks already made,
   as also in what respects they differ from each other, and when and in
   dealing with whom they are severally useful; but perhaps there is no
   reason why, with a view to the general certainty, and because of the
   connection of what has been said with what remains, we should not make
   a fresh beginning from these same points and those which are allied to
   them. To the one kind of argument it naturally pertains to hold the
   foremost place, to the other to attend upon the first, and clear the
   way, and to remove whatever is obstructive or hostile. The discourse
   concerning the truth, as being necessary to all men for certainty and
   safety, holds the first place, whether in nature, or order, or
   usefulness: in nature, as furnishing the knowledge of the subject; in
   order, as being in those things and along with those things which it
   informs us of; in usefulness, as being a guarantee of certainty and
   safety to those who become acquainted with it. The discourse in defence
   of the truth is inferior in nature and force, for the refutation of
   falsehood is less important than the establishment of truth; and second
   in order, for it employs its strength against those who hold false
   opinions, and false opinions are an aftergrowth from another sowing and
   from degeneration. But, notwithstanding all this, it is often placed
   first, and sometimes is found more useful, because it removes and
   clears away beforehand the disbelief which disquiets some minds, and
   the doubt or false opinion of such as have but recently come over. And
   yet each of them is referrible to the same end, for the refutation of
   falsehood and the establishment of truth both have piety for their
   object: not, indeed, that they are absolutely one and the same, but the
   one is necessary, as I have said, to all who believe, and to those who
   are concerned about the truth and their own salvation; but the other
   proves to be more useful on some occasions, and to some persons, and in
   dealing with some. Thus much by way of recapitulation, to recall what
   has been already said. We must now pass on to what we proposed, and
   show the truth of the doctrine concerning the resurrection, both from
   the cause itself, according to which, and on account of which, the
   first man and his posterity were created, although they were not
   brought into existence in the same manner, and from the common nature
   of all men as men; and further, from the judgment of their Maker upon
   them according to the time each has lived, and according to the rules
   by which each has regulated his behaviour,--a judgment which no one can
   doubt will be just.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XII.--Argument for the Resurrection From the Purpose Contemplated
      in Man's Creation.

   The argument from the cause will appear, if we consider whether man was
   made at random and in vain, or for some purpose; and if for some
   purpose, whether simply that he might live and continue in the natural
   condition in which he was created, or for the use of another; and if
   with a view to use, whether for that of the Creator Himself, or of some
   one of the beings who belong to Him, and are by Him deemed worthy of
   greater care. Now, if we consider this in the most general way, we find
   that a person of sound mind, and who is moved by a rational judgment to
   do anything, does nothing in vain which he does intentionally, but
   either for his own use, or for the use of some other person for whom he
   cares, or for the sake of the work itself, being moved by some natural
   inclination and affection towards its production. For instance (to make
   use of an illustration, that our meaning may be clear), a man makes a
   house for his own use, but for cattle and camels and other animals of
   which he has need he makes the shelter suitable for each of them; not
   for his own use, if we regard the appearance only, though for that, if
   we look at the end he has in view, but as regards the immediate object,
   from concern for those for whom he cares. He has children, too, not for
   his own use, nor for the sake of anything else belonging to him, but
   that those who spring from him may exist and continue as long as
   possible, thus by the succession of children and grandchildren
   comforting himself respecting the close of his own life, and hoping in
   this way to immortalize the mortal. Such is the procedure of men. But
   God can neither have made man in vain, for He is wise, and no work of
   wisdom is in vain; nor for His own use, for He is in want of nothing.
   But to a Being absolutely in need of nothing, no one of His works can
   contribute anything to His own use. Neither, again, did He make man for
   the sake of any of the other works which He has made. For nothing that
   is endowed with reason and judgment has been created, or is created,
   for the use of another, whether greater or less than itself, but for
   the sake of the life and continuance of the being itself so created.
   For reason cannot discover any use which might be deemed a cause for
   the creation of men, since immortals are free from want, and in need of
   no help from men in order to their existence; and irrational beings are
   by nature in a state of subjection, and perform those services for men
   for which each of them was intended, but are not intended in their turn
   to make use of men: for it neither was nor is right to lower that which
   rules and takes the lead to the use of the inferior, or to subject the
   rational to the irrational, which is not suited to rule. Therefore, if
   man has been created neither without cause and in vain (for none of
   God's works is in vain, so far at least as the purpose of their Maker
   is concerned), nor for the use of the Maker Himself, or of any of the
   works which have proceeded from Him, it is quite clear that although,
   according to the first and more general view of the subject, God made
   man for Himself, and in pursuance of the goodness and wisdom which are
   conspicuous throughout the creation, yet, according to the view which
   more nearly touches the beings created, He made him for the sake of the
   life of those created, which is not kindled for a little while and then
   extinguished. For to creeping things, I suppose, and birds, and fishes,
   or, to speak more generally, all irrational creatures, God has assigned
   such a life as that; but to those who bear upon them the image of the
   Creator Himself, and are endowed with understanding, and blessed with a
   rational judgment, the Creator has assigned perpetual duration, in
   order that, recognising their own Maker, and His power and skill, and
   obeying law and justice, they may pass their whole existence free from
   suffering, in the possession of those qualities with which they have
   bravely borne their preceding life, although they lived in corruptible
   and earthly bodies. For whatever has been created for the sake of
   something else, when that has ceased to be for the sake of which it was
   created, will itself also fitly cease to be, and will not continue to
   exist in vain, since, among the works of God, that which is useless can
   have no place; but that which was created for the very purpose of
   existing and living a life naturally suited to it, since the cause
   itself is bound up with its nature, and is recognised only in
   connection with existence itself, can never admit of any cause which
   shall utterly annihilate its existence. But since this cause is seen to
   lie in perpetual existence, the being so created must be preserved for
   ever, doing and experiencing what is suitable to its nature, each of
   the two parts of which it consists contributing what belongs to it, so
   that the soul may exist and remain without change in the nature in
   which it was made, and discharge its appropriate functions (such as
   presiding over the impulses of the body, and judging of and measuring
   that which occurs from time to time by the proper standards and
   measures), and the body be moved according to its nature towards its
   appropriate objects, and undergo the changes allotted to it, and, among
   the rest (relating to age, or appearance, or size), the resurrection.
   For the resurrection is a species of change, and the last of all, and a
   change for the better of what still remains in existence at that time.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XIII.--Continuation of the Argument.

   [837] Confident of these things, no less than of those which have
   already come to pass, and reflecting on our own nature, we are content
   with a life associated with neediness and corruption, as suited to our
   present state of existence, and we stedfastly hope for a continuance of
   being in immortality; and this we do not take without foundation from
   the inventions of men, feeding ourselves on false hopes, but our belief
   rests on a most infallible guarantee--the purpose of Him who fashioned
   us, according to which He made man of an immortal soul [838] and a
   body, and furnished him with understanding and an innate law for the
   preservation and safeguard of the things given by Him as suitable to an
   intelligent existence and a rational life: for we know well that He
   would not have fashioned such a being, and furnished him with
   everything belonging to perpetuity, had He not intended that what was
   so created should continue in perpetuity. If, therefore, the Maker of
   this universe made man with a view to his partaking of an intelligent
   life, and that, having become a spectator of His grandeur, and of the
   wisdom which is manifest in all things, he might continue always in the
   contemplation of these; then, according to the purpose of his Author,
   and the nature which he has received, the cause of his creation is a
   pledge of his continuance for ever, and this continuance is a pledge of
   the resurrection, without which man could not continue. So that, from
   what has been said, it is quite clear that the resurrection is plainly
   proved by the cause of man's creation, and the purpose of Him who made
   him. Such being the nature of the cause for which man has been brought
   into this world, the next thing will be to consider that which
   immediately follows, naturally or in the order proposed; and in our
   investigation the cause of their creation is followed by the nature of
   the men so created, and the nature of those created by the just
   judgment of their Maker upon them, and all these by the end of their
   existence. Having investigated therefore the point placed first in
   order, we must now go on to consider the nature of men.

     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XIV.--The Resurrection Does Not Rest Solely on the Fact of a
      Future Judgment.

   The proof [839] of the several doctrines of which the truth consists,
   or of any matter whatsoever proposed for examination, if it is to
   produce an unwavering confidence in what is said, must begin, not from
   anything without, nor from what certain persons think or have thought,
   [840] but from the common and natural notion [841] of the matter, or
   from the connection of secondary truths with primary ones. For the
   question relates either to primary beliefs, and then all that is
   necessary is reminiscence, so as to stir up the natural notion; or to
   things which naturally follow from the first and to their natural
   sequence. And in these things we must observe order, showing what
   strictly follows from the first truths, or from those which are placed
   first, so as neither to be unmindful of the truth, or of our certainty
   respecting it, nor to confound the things arranged by nature and
   distinguished from each other, or break up the natural order. Hence I
   think it behoves those who desire to handle the subject with fairness,
   and who wish to form an intelligent judgment whether there is a
   resurrection or not, first to consider attentively the force of the
   arguments contributing to the proof of this, and what place each of
   them holds--which is first, which second, which third, and which last.
   And in the arrangement of these they should place first the cause of
   the creation of men,--namely, the purpose of the Creator in making man;
   and then connect with this, as is suitable, the nature of the men so
   created; not as being second in order, but because we are unable to
   pass our judgment on both at the same time, although they have the
   closest natural connection with each other, and are of equal force in
   reference to the subject before us. But while from these proofs as the
   primary ones, and as being derived from the work of creation, the
   resurrection is clearly demonstrated, none the less can we gain
   conviction respecting it from the arguments taken from providence,--I
   mean from the reward or punishment due to each man in accordance with
   just judgment, and from the end of human existence. For many, in
   discussing the subject of the resurrection, have rested the whole cause
   on the third argument alone, deeming that the cause of the resurrection
   is the judgment. But the fallacy of this is very clearly shown, from
   the fact that, although all human beings who die rise again, yet not
   all who rise again are to be judged: for if only a just judgment were
   the cause of the resurrection, it would of course follow that those who
   had done neither evil nor good--namely, very young children [842]
   --would not rise again; but seeing that all are to rise again, those
   who have died in infancy as well as others, they too justify our
   conclusion that the resurrection takes place not for the sake of the
   judgment as the primary reason, but in consequence of the purpose of
   God in forming men, and the nature of the beings so formed.

      Chapter XV.--Argument for the Resurrection from the Nature of Man.

   But while the cause discoverable in the creation of men is of itself
   sufficient to prove that the resurrection follows by natural sequence
   on the dissolution of bodies, yet it is perhaps right not to shrink
   from adducing either of the proposed arguments, but, agreeably to what
   has been said, to point out to those who are not able of themselves to
   discern them, the arguments from each of the truths evolved from the
   primary; and first and foremost, the nature of the men created, which
   conducts us to the same notion, and has the same force as evidence of
   the resurrection. For if the whole nature of men in general is composed
   of an immortal soul and a body which was fitted to it in the creation,
   and if neither to the nature of the soul by itself, nor to the nature
   of the body separately, has God assigned such a creation or such a life
   and entire course of existence as this, but to men compounded of the
   two, in order that they may, when they have passed through their
   present existence, arrive at one common end, with the same elements of
   which they are composed at their birth and during life, it unavoidably
   follows, since one living-being is formed from the two, experiencing
   whatever the soul experiences and whatever the body experiences, doing
   and performing whatever requires the judgment of the senses or of the
   reason, that the whole series of these things must be referred to some
   one end, in order that they all, and by means of all,--namely, man's
   creation, man's nature, man's life, man's doings and sufferings, his
   course of existence, and the end suitable to his nature,--may concur in
   one harmony and the same common experience. But if there is some one
   harmony and community of experience belonging to the whole being,
   whether of the things which spring from the soul or of those which are
   accomplished by means of the body, the end for all these must also be
   one. And the end will be in strictness one, if the being whose end that
   end is remains the same in its constitution; and the being will be
   exactly the same, if all those things of which the being consists as
   parts are the same. And they will be the same in respect of their
   peculiar union, if the parts dissolved are again united for the
   constitution of the being. And the constitution of the same men of
   necessity proves that a resurrection will follow of the dead and
   dissolved bodies; for without this, neither could the same parts be
   united according to nature with one another, nor could the nature of
   the same men be reconstituted. And if both understanding and reason
   have been given to men for the discernment of things which are
   perceived by the understanding, and not of existences only, but also of
   the goodness and wisdom and rectitude of their Giver, it necessarily
   follows that, since those things continue for the sake of which the
   rational judgment is given, the judgment given for these things should
   also continue. But it is impossible for this to continue, unless the
   nature which has received it, and in which it adheres, continues. But
   that which has received both understanding and reason is man, not the
   soul by itself. Man, therefore, who consists of the two parts, must
   continue for ever. But it is impossible for him to continue unless he
   rise again. For if no resurrection were to take place, the nature of
   men as men would not continue. And if the nature of men does not
   continue, in vain has the soul been fitted to the need of the body and
   to its experiences; in vain has the body been fettered so that it
   cannot obtain what it longs for, obedient to the reins of the soul, and
   guided by it as with a bridle; in vain is the understanding, in vain is
   wisdom, and the observance of rectitude, or even the practice of every
   virtue, and the enactment and enforcement of laws,--to say all in a
   word, whatever is noble in men or for men's sake, or rather the very
   creation and nature of men. But if vanity is utterly excluded from all
   the works of God, and from all the gifts bestowed by Him, the
   conclusion is unavoidable, that, along with the interminable duration
   of the soul, there will be a perpetual continuance of the body
   according to its proper nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XVI--Analogy of Death and Sleep, and Consequent Argument for the
      Resurrection.

   And let no one think it strange that we call by the name of life a
   continuance of being which is interrupted by death and corruption; but
   let him consider rather that this word has not one meaning only, nor is
   there only one measure of continuance, because the nature also of the
   things that continue is not one. For if each of the things that
   continue has its continuance according to its peculiar nature, neither
   in the case of those who are wholly incorruptible and immortal shall we
   find the continuance like ours, because the natures of superior beings
   do not take the level of such as are inferior; nor in men is it proper
   to look for a continuance invariable and unchangeable; inasmuch as the
   former are from the first created immortal, and continue to exist
   without end by the simple will of their Maker, and men, in respect of
   the soul, have from their first origin an unchangeable continuance, but
   in respect of the body obtain immortality by means of change. This is
   what is meant by the doctrine of the resurrection; and, looking to
   this, we both await the dissolution of the body, as the sequel to a
   life of want and corruption, and after this we hope for a continuance
   with immortality, [843] not putting either our death on a level with
   the death of the irrational animals, or the continuance of man with the
   continuance of immortals, lest we should unawares in this way put human
   nature and life on a level with things with which it is not proper to
   compare them. It ought not, therefore, to excite dissatisfaction, if
   some inequality appears to exist in regard to the duration of men; nor,
   because the separation of the soul from the members of the body and the
   dissolution of its parts interrupts the continuity of life, must we
   therefore despair of the resurrection. For although the relaxation of
   the senses and of the physical powers, which naturally takes place in
   sleep, seems to interrupt the sensational life when men sleep at equal
   intervals of time, and, as it were, come back to life again, yet we do
   not refuse to call it life; and for this reason, I suppose, some call
   sleep the brother of death, [844] not as deriving their origin from the
   same ancestors and fathers, but because those who are dead and those
   who sleep are subject to similar states, as regards at least the
   stillness and the absence of all sense of the present or the past, or
   rather of existence itself and their own life. If, therefore, we do not
   refuse to call by the name of life the life of men full of such
   inequality from birth to dissolution, and interrupted by all those
   things which we have before mentioned, neither ought we to despair of
   the life succeeding to dissolution, such as involves the resurrection,
   although for a time it is interrupted by the separation of the soul
   from the body.

      Chapter XVII.--The Series of Changes We Can Now Trace in Man Renders a
      Resurrection Probable.

   For this nature of men, which has inequality allotted to it from the
   first, and according to the purpose of its Maker, has an unequal life
   and continuance, interrupted sometimes by sleep, at another time by
   death, and by the changes incident to each period of life, whilst those
   which follow the first are not clearly seen beforehand. Would any one
   have believed, unless taught by experience, that in the soft seed alike
   in all its parts there was deposited such a variety and number of great
   powers, or of masses, which in this way arise and become
   consolidated--I mean of bones, and nerves, and cartilages, of muscles
   too, and flesh, and intestines, and the other parts of the body? For
   neither in the yet moist seed is anything of this kind to be seen, nor
   even in infants do any of those things make their appearance which
   pertain to adults, or in the adult period what belongs to those who are
   past their prime, or in these what belongs to such as have grown old.
   But although some of the things I have said exhibit not at all, and
   others but faintly, the natural sequence and the changes that come upon
   the nature of men, yet all who are not blinded in their judgment of
   these matters by vice or sloth, know that there must be first the
   depositing of the seed, and that when this is completely organized in
   respect of every member and part and the progeny comes forth to the
   light, there comes the growth belonging to the first period of life,
   and the maturity which attends growth, and after the maturity the
   slackening of the physical powers till old age, and then, when the body
   is worn out, its dissolution. As, therefore, in this matter, though
   neither the seed has inscribed upon it the life or form of men, nor the
   life the dissolution into the primary elements; the succession of
   natural occurrences makes things credible which have no credibility
   from the phenomena themselves, much more does reason, tracing out the
   truth from the natural sequence, afford ground for believing in the
   resurrection, since it is safer and stronger than experience for
   establishing the truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XVIII.--Judgment Must Have Reference Both to Soul and Body: There
      Will Therefore Be a Resurrection.

   The arguments I just now proposed for examination, as establishing the
   truth of the resurrection, are all of the same kind, since they all
   start from the same point; for their starting-point is the origin of
   the first men by creation. But while some of them derive their strength
   from the starting-point itself from which they take their rise, others,
   consequent upon the nature and the life of men, acquire their
   credibility from the superintendence of God over us; for the cause
   according to which, and on account of which, men have come into being,
   being closely connected with the nature of men, derives its force from
   creation; but the argument from rectitude, which represents God as
   judging men according as they have lived well or ill, derives its force
   from the end of their existence: they come into being on the former
   ground, but their state depends more on God's superintendence. And now
   that the matters which come first have been demonstrated by me to the
   best of my ability, it will be well to prove our proposition by those
   also which come after--I mean by the reward or punishment due to each
   man in accordance with righteous judgment, and by the final cause of
   human existence; and of these I put foremost that which takes the lead
   by nature, and inquire first into the argument relating to the
   judgment: premising only one thing, from concern for the principle
   which appertains to the matters before us, and for order--namely, that
   it is incumbent on those who admit God to be the Maker of this
   universe, to ascribe to His wisdom and rectitude the preservation and
   care of all that has been created, if they wish to keep to their own
   principles; and with such views to hold that nothing either in earth or
   in heaven is without guardianship or providence, but that, on the
   contrary, to everything, invisible and visible alike, small and great,
   the attention of the Creator reaches; for all created things require
   the attention of the Creator, [845] and each one in particular,
   according to its nature and the end for which it was made: though I
   think it would be a useless expenditure of trouble to go through the
   list now, or distinguish between the several cases, or mention in
   detail what is suitable to each nature. Man, at all events, of whom it
   is now our business to speak, as being in want, requires food; as being
   mortal, posterity; as being rational, a process of judgment. But if
   each of these things belongs to man by nature, and he requires food for
   his life, and requires posterity for the continuance of the race, and
   requires a judgment in order that food and posterity may be according
   to law, it of course follows, since food and posterity refer to both
   together, that the judgment must be referred to them too (by both
   together I mean man, consisting of soul and body), and that such man
   becomes accountable for all his actions, and receives for them either
   reward or punishment. Now, if the righteous judgment awards to both
   together its retribution for the deeds wrought; and if it is not proper
   that either the soul alone should receive the wages of the deeds
   wrought in union with the body (for this of itself has no inclination
   to the faults which are committed in connection with the pleasure or
   food and culture of the body), or that the body alone should (for this
   of itself is incapable of distinguishing law and justice), but man,
   composed of these, is subjected to trial for each of the deeds wrought
   by him; and if reason does not find this happening either in this life
   (for the award according to merit finds no place in the present
   existence, since many atheists and persons who practice every iniquity
   and wickedness live on to the last, unvisited by calamity, whilst, on
   the contrary, those who have manifestly lived an exemplary life in
   respect of every virtue, live in pain, in insult, in calumny and
   outrage, and suffering of all kinds) or after death (for both together
   no longer exist, the soul being separated from the body, and the body
   itself being resolved again into the materials out of which it was
   composed, and no longer retaining anything of its former structure or
   form, much less the remembrance of its actions): the result of all this
   is very plain to every one,--namely, that, in the language of the
   apostle, "this corruptible (and dissoluble) must put on incorruption,"
   [846] in order that those who were dead, having been made alive by the
   resurrection, and the parts that were separated and entirely dissolved
   having been again united, each one may, in accordance with justice,
   receive what he has done by the body, whether it be good or bad.

      Chapter XIX.--Man Would Be More Unfavourably Situated Than the Beasts If
      There Were No Resurrection.

   In replying, then, to those who acknowledge a divine superintendence,
   and admit the same principles as we do, yet somehow depart from their
   own admissions, one may use such arguments as those which have been
   adduced, and many more than these, should he be disposed to amplify
   what has been said only concisely and in a cursory manner. But in
   dealing with those who differ from us concerning primary truths, it
   will perhaps be well to lay down another principle antecedent to these,
   joining with them in doubting of the things to which their opinions
   relate, and examining the matter along with them in this
   manner--whether the life of men, and their entire course of existence,
   is overlooked, and a sort of dense darkness is poured down upon the
   earth, hiding in ignorance and silence both the men themselves and
   their actions; or whether it is much safer to be of opinion that the
   Maker presides over the things which He Himself has made, inspecting
   all things whatsoever which exist, or come into existence, Judge of
   both deeds and purposes. For if no judgment whatever were to be passed
   on the actions of men, men would have no advantage over the irrational
   creatures, but rather would fare worse than these do, inasmuch as they
   keep in subjection their passions, and concern themselves about piety,
   and righteousness, and the other virtues; and a life after the manner
   of brutes would be the best, virtue would be absurd, the threat of
   judgment a matter for broad laughter, indulgence in every kind of
   pleasure the highest good, and the common resolve of all these and
   their one law would be that maxim, so dear to the intemperate and lewd,
   "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." For the termination of
   such a life is not even pleasure, as some suppose, but utter
   insensibility. But if the Maker of men takes any concern about His own
   works, and the distinction is anywhere to be found between those who
   have lived well and ill, it must be either in the present life, while
   men are still living who have conducted themselves virtuously or
   viciously, or after death, when men are in a state of separation and
   dissolution. But according to neither of these suppositions can we find
   a just judgment taking place; for neither do the good in the present
   life obtain the rewards of virtue, nor yet do the bad receive the wages
   of vice. I pass over the fact, that so long as the nature we at present
   possess is preserved, the moral nature is not able to bear a punishment
   commensurate with the more numerous or more serious faults. For the
   robber, or ruler, or tyrant, who has unjustly put to death myriads on
   myriads, could not by one death make restitution for these deeds; and
   the man who holds no true opinion concerning God, but lives in all
   outrage and blasphemy, despises divine things, breaks the laws, commits
   outrage against boys and women alike, razes cities unjustly, burns
   houses with their inhabitants, and devastates a country, and at the
   same time destroys inhabitants of cities and peoples, and even an
   entire nation--how in a mortal body could he endure a penalty adequate
   to these crimes, since death prevents the deserved punishment, and the
   mortal nature does not suffice for any single one of his deeds? It is
   proved, therefore, that neither in the present life is there a judgment
   according to men's deserts, nor after death.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XX.--Man Must Be Possessed Both of a Body and Soul Hereafter, that
      the Judgment Passed Upon Him May Be Just.

   For either death is the entire extinction of life, the soul being
   dissolved and corrupted along with the body, or the soul remains by
   itself, incapable of dissolution, of dispersion, of corruption, whilst
   the body is corrupted and dissolved, retaining no longer any
   remembrance of past actions, nor sense of what it experienced in
   connection with the soul. If the life of men is to be utterly
   extinguished, it is manifest there will be no care for men who are not
   living, no judgment respecting those who have lived in virtue or in
   vice; but there will rush in again upon us whatever belongs to a
   lawless life, and the swarm of absurdities which follow from it, and
   that which is the summit of this lawlessness--atheism. But if the body
   were to be corrupted, and each of the dissolved particles to pass to
   its kindred element, yet the soul to remain by itself as immortal,
   neither on this supposition would any judgment on the soul take place,
   since there would be an absence of equity: for it is unlawful to
   suspect that any judgment can proceed out of God and from God which is
   wanting in equity. Yet equity is wanting to the judgment, if the being
   is not preserved in existence who practiced righteousness or
   lawlessness: for that which practiced each of the things in life on
   which the judgment is passed was man, not soul by itself. To sum up all
   in a word, this view will in no case consist with equity.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXI.--Continuation of the Argument.

   For if good deeds are rewarded, the body will clearly be wronged,
   inasmuch as it has shared with the soul in the toils connected with
   well-doing, but does not share in the reward of the good deeds, and
   because, though the soul is often excused for certain faults on the
   ground of the body's neediness and want, the body itself is deprived of
   all share in the good deeds done, the toils on behalf of which it
   helped to bear during life. Nor, again, if faults are judged, is the
   soul dealt fairly with, supposing it alone to pay the penalty for the
   faults it committed through being solicited by the body and drawn away
   by it to its own appetites and motions, at one time being seized upon
   and carried off, at another attracted in some very violent manner, and
   sometimes concurring with it by way of kindness and attention to its
   preservation. How can it possibly be other than unjust for the soul to
   be judged by itself in respect of things towards which in its own
   nature it feels no appetite, no motion, no impulse, such as
   licentiousness, violence, covetousness, injustice, and the unjust acts
   arising out of these? For if the majority of such evils come from men's
   not having the mastery of the passions which solicit them, and they are
   solicited by the neediness and want of the body, and the care and
   attention required by it (for these are the motives for every
   acquisition of property, and especially for the using of it, and
   moreover for marriage and all the actions of life, in which things, and
   in connection with which, is seen what is faulty and what is not so),
   how can it be just for the soul alone to be judged in respect of those
   things which the body is the first to be sensible of, and in which it
   draws the soul away to sympathy and participation in actions with a
   view to things which it wants; and that the appetites and pleasures,
   and moreover the fears and sorrows, in which whatever exceeds the
   proper bounds is amenable to judgment, should be set in motion by the
   body, and yet that the sins arising from these, and the punishments for
   the sins committed, should fall upon the soul alone, which neither
   needs anything of this sort, nor desires nor fears or suffers of itself
   any such thing as man is wont to suffer? But even if we hold that these
   affections do not pertain to the body alone, but to man, in saying
   which we should speak correctly, because the life of man is one, though
   composed of the two, yet surely we shall not assert that these things
   belong to the soul, if we only look simply at its peculiar nature. For
   if it is absolutely without need of food, it can never desire those
   things which it does not in the least require for its subsistence; nor
   can it feel any impulse towards any of those things which it is not at
   all fitted to use; nor, again, can it be grieved at the want of money
   or other property, since these are not suited to it. And if, too, it is
   superior to corruption, it fears nothing whatever as destructive of
   itself: it has no dread of famine, or disease, or mutilation, or
   blemish, or fire, or sword, since it cannot suffer from any of these
   any hurt or pain, because neither bodies nor bodily powers touch it at
   all. But if it is absurd to attach the passions to the soul as
   belonging specially to it, it is in the highest degree unjust and
   unworthy of the judgment of God to lay upon the soul alone the sins
   which spring from them, and the consequent punishments.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXII.--Continuation of the Argument.

   In addition to what has been said, is it not absurd that, while we
   cannot even have the notion of virtue and vice as existing separately
   in the soul (for we recognise the virtues as man's virtues, even as in
   like manner vice, their opposite, as not belonging to the soul in
   separation from the body, and existing by itself), yet that the reward
   or punishment for these should be assigned to the soul alone? How can
   any one have even the notion of courage or fortitude as existing in the
   soul alone, when it has no fear of death, or wounds, or maiming, or
   loss, or maltreatment, or of the pain connected with these, or the
   suffering resulting from them? And what shall we say of self-control
   and temperance, when there is no desire drawing it to food or sexual
   intercourse, or other pleasures and enjoyments, nor any other thing
   soliciting it from within or exciting it from without? And what of
   practical wisdom, when things are not proposed to it which may or may
   not be done, nor things to be chosen or avoided, or rather when there
   is in it no motion at all or natural impulse towards the doing of
   anything? And how in any sense can equity be an attribute of souls,
   either in reference to one another or to anything else, whether of the
   same or of a different kind, when they are not able from any source, or
   by any means, or in any way, to bestow that which is equal according to
   merit or according to analogy, with the exception of the honour
   rendered to God, and, moreover, have no impulse or motion towards the
   use of their own things, or abstinence from those of others, since the
   use of those things which are according to nature, or the abstinence
   from them, is considered in reference to those who are so constituted
   as to use them, whereas the soul neither wants anything, nor is so
   constituted as to use any things or any single thing, and therefore
   what is called the independent action of the parts cannot be found in
   the soul so constituted?
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXIII.--Continuation of the Argument.

   But the most irrational thing of all is this: to impose properly
   sanctioned laws on men, and then to assign to their souls alone the
   recompense of their lawful or unlawful deeds. For if he who receives
   the laws would also justly receive the recompense of the transgression
   of the laws, and if it was man that received the laws, and not the soul
   by itself, man must also bear the recompense for the sins committed,
   and not the soul by itself, since God has not enjoined on souls to
   abstain from things which have no relation to them, such as adultery,
   murder, theft, rapine, dishonour to parents, and every desire in
   general that tends to the injury and loss of our neighbours. For
   neither the command, "Honour thy father and thy mother," is adapted to
   souls alone, since such names are not applicable to them, for souls do
   not produce souls, so as to appropriate the appellation of father or
   mother, but men produce men; nor could the command, "Thou shalt not
   commit adultery," ever be properly addressed to souls, or even thought
   of in such a connection, since the difference of male and female does
   not exist in them, nor any aptitude for sexual intercourse, nor
   appetite for it; and where there is no appetite, there can be no
   intercourse; and where there is no intercourse at all, there can be no
   legitimate intercourse, namely marriage; and where there is no lawful
   intercourse, neither can there be unlawful desire of, or intercourse
   with, another man's wife, namely adultery. Nor, again, is the
   prohibition of theft, or of the desire of having more, applicable to
   souls, for they do not need those things, through the need of which, by
   reason of natural indigence or want, men are accustomed to steal or to
   rob, such as gold, or silver, or an animal, or something else adapted
   for food, or shelter, or use; for to an immortal nature everything
   which is desired by the needy as useful is useless. But let the fuller
   discussion of these matters be left to those who wish to investigate
   each point more exactly, or to contend more earnestly with opponents.
   But, since what has just been said, and that which concurs with this to
   guarantee the resurrection, suffices for us, it would not be seasonable
   to dwell any longer upon them; for we have not made it our aim to omit
   nothing that might be said, but to point out in a summary manner to
   those who have assembled what ought to be thought concerning the
   resurrection, and to adapt to the capacity of those present the
   arguments bearing on this question.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter XXIV.--Argument for the Resurrection from the Chief End of Man.

   The points proposed for consideration having been to some extent
   investigated, it remains to examine the argument from the end or final
   cause, which indeed has already emerged in what has been said, and only
   requires just so much attention and further discussion as may enable us
   to avoid the appearance of leaving unmentioned any of the matters
   briefly referred to by us, and thus indirectly damaging the subject or
   the division of topics made at the outset. For the sake of those
   present, therefore, and of others who may pay attention to this
   subject, it may be well just to signify that each of those things which
   are constituted by nature, and of those which are made by art, must
   have an end peculiar to itself, as indeed is taught us by the common
   sense of all men, and testified by the things that pass before our
   eyes. For do we not see that husbandmen have one end, and physicians
   another; and again, the things which spring out of the earth another,
   and the animals nourished upon it, and produced according to a certain
   natural series, another? If this is evident, and natural and artificial
   powers, and the actions arising from these, must by all means be
   accompanied by an end in accordance with nature, it is absolutely
   necessary that the end of men, since it is that of a peculiar nature,
   should be separated from community with the rest; for it is not lawful
   to suppose the same end for beings destitute of rational judgment, and
   of those whose actions are regulated by the innate law and reason, and
   who live an intelligent life and observe justice. Freedom from pain,
   therefore, cannot be the proper end for the latter, for this they would
   have in common with beings utterly devoid of sensibility: nor can it
   consist in the enjoyment of things which nourish or delight the body,
   or in an abundance of pleasures; else a life like that of the brutes
   must hold the first place, while that regulated by virtue is without a
   final cause. For such an end as this, I suppose, belongs to beasts and
   cattle, not to men possessed of an immortal soul and rational judgment.

      Chapter XXV.--Argument Continued and Concluded.

   Nor again is it the happiness of soul separated from body: for we are
   not inquiring about the life or final cause of either of the parts of
   which man consists, but of the being who is composed of both; for such
   is every man who has a share in this present existence, and there must
   be some appropriate end proposed for this life. But if it is the end of
   both parts together, and this can be discovered neither while they are
   still living in the present state of existence through the numerous
   causes already mentioned, nor yet when the soul is in a state of
   separation, because the man cannot be said to exist when the body is
   dissolved, and indeed entirely scattered abroad, even though the soul
   continue by itself--it is absolutely necessary that the end of a man's
   being should appear in some reconstitution of the two together, and of
   the same living being. And as this follows of necessity, there must by
   all means be a resurrection of the bodies which are dead, or even
   entirely dissolved, and the same men must be formed anew, since the law
   of nature ordains the end not absolutely, nor as the end of any men
   whatsoever, but of the same men who passed through the previous life;
   but it is impossible for the same men to be reconstituted unless the
   same bodies are restored to the same souls. But that the same soul
   should obtain the same body is impossible in any other way, and
   possible only by the resurrection; for if this takes place, an end
   befitting the nature of men follows also. And we shall make no mistake
   in saying, that the final cause of an intelligent life and rational
   judgment, is to be occupied uninterruptedly with those objects to which
   the natural reason is chiefly and primarily adapted, and to delight
   unceasingly in the contemplation of Him who is, and of His decrees,
   notwithstanding that the majority of men, because they are affected too
   passionately and too violently by things below, pass through life
   without attaining this object. For the large number of those who fail
   of the end that belongs to them does not make void the common lot,
   since the examination relates to individuals, and the reward or
   punishment of lives ill or well spent is proportioned to the merit of
   each.

   [This concluding chapter is of itself a masterpiece, and comforts my
   own soul unspeakably, as proving that this life is very precious, if
   only directed to the end from which we are created. Blest be
   Athenagoras for completing what St. Paul began on the Areopagus, and
   for giving us "beauty for ashes" out of the gardens of Plato. Now we
   find what power there was in the apostle's word, when he preached to
   the Athenians, "Jesus and the resurrection."]

  Introductory Note

    to

CLement of Alexandria
     __________________________________________________________________

   [a.d. 153-193-217.] The second century of illumination is drawing to a
   close, as the great name of this Father comes into view, and introduces
   us to a new stage of the Church's progress. From Britain to the Ganges
   it had already made its mark. In all its Oriental identity, we have
   found it vigorous in Gaul and penetrating to other regions of the West.
   From its primitive base on the Orontes, it has extended itself to the
   deltas of the Nile; and the Alexandria of Apollos and of St. Mark has
   become the earliest seat of Christian learning. There, already, have
   the catechetical schools gathered the finest intellectual trophies of
   the Cross; and under the aliment of its library springs up something
   like a Christian university. Pantænus, "the Sicilian bee" from the
   flowery fields of Enna, comes to frame it by his industry, and store it
   with the sweets of his eloquence and wisdom. Clement, who had followed
   Tatian to the East, tracks Pantænus to Egypt, and comes with his Attic
   scholarship to be his pupil in the school of Christ. After Justin and
   Irenæus, he is to be reckoned the founder of Christian literature; and
   it is noteworthy how sublimely he begins to treat Paganism as a creed
   outworn, to be dismissed with contempt, rather than seriously wrestled
   with any longer.

   His merciless exposure of the entire system of "lords many and gods
   many," seems to us, indeed, unnecessarily offensive. Why not spare us
   such details? But let us reflect, that, if such are our Christian
   instincts of delicacy, we owe it to this great reformer in no small
   proportion. For not content to show the Pagans that the very atmosphere
   was polluted by their mythologies, so that Christians, turn which way
   they would, must encounter pestilence, he becomes the ethical
   philosopher of Christians; and while he proceeds to dictate, even in
   minute details, the transformations to which the faithful must subject
   themselves in order "to escape the pollutions of the world," he
   sketches in outline the reformations which the Gospel imposes on
   society, and which nothing but the Gospel has ever enabled mankind to
   realize. "For with a celerity unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which
   we have ready access," says Clement, "the Divine Power hath filled the
   universe with the seed of salvation." Socrates and Plato had talked
   sublimely four hundred years before; but Lust and Murder were yet the
   gods of Greece, and men and women were like what they worshipped.
   Clement had been their disciple; but now, as the disciple of Christ, he
   was to exert a power over men and manners, of which they never dreamed.

   Alexandria becomes the brain of Christendom: its heart was yet beating
   at Antioch, but the West was still receptive only, its hands and arms
   stretched forth towards the sunrise for further enlightenment. From the
   East it had obtained the Scriptures and their authentication, and from
   the same source was deriving the canons, the liturgies, and the creed
   of Christendom. The universal language of Christians is Greek. To a
   pagan emperor who had outgrown the ideas of Nero's time, it was no
   longer Judaism; but it was not less an Oriental superstition,
   essentially Greek in its features and its dress. "All the churches of
   the West," [847] says the historian of Latin Christianity, "were Greek
   religious colonies. Their language was Greek, their organization Greek,
   their writers Greek, their Scriptures and their ritual were Greek.
   Through Greek, the communications of the churches of the West were
   constantly kept up with the East. . . . Thus the Church at Rome was but
   one of a confederation of Greek religious republics founded by
   Christianity." Now this confederation was the Holy Catholic Church.

   Every Christian must recognise the career of Alexander, and the history
   of his empire, as an immediate precursor of the Gospel. The patronage
   of letters by the Ptolemies at Alexandria, the translation of the
   Hebrew Scriptures into the dialect of the Hellenes, the creation of a
   new terminology in the language of the Greeks, by which ideas of faith
   and of truth might find access to the mind of a heathen world,--these
   were preliminaries to the preaching of the Gospel to mankind, and to
   the composition of the New Testament of our Lord and Saviour. He
   Himself had prophetically visited Egypt, and the idols were now to be
   removed before his presence. There a powerful Christian school was to
   make itself felt for ever in the definitions of orthodoxy; and in a new
   sense was that prophecy to be understood, "Out of Egypt have I called
   my Son."

   The genius of Apollos was revived in his native city. A succession of
   doctors was there to arise, like him, "eloquent men, and mighty in the
   Scriptures." Clement tells us of his masters in Christ, and how, coming
   to Pantænus, his soul was filled with a deathless element of divine
   knowledge. [848] He speaks of the apostolic tradition as received
   through his teachers hardly at second-hand. He met in that school, no
   doubt, some, at least, who recalled Ignatius and Polycarp; some,
   perhaps, who as children had heard St. John when he could only exhort
   his congregations to "love one another." He could afterwards speak of
   himself as in the next succession after the apostles.

   He became the successor of Pantænus in the catechetical school, and had
   Origen for his pupil, with other eminent men. He was also ordained a
   presbyter. He seems to have compiled his Stromata in the reigns of
   Commodus and Severus. If, at this time, he was about forty years of
   age, as seems likely, we must conceive of his birth at Athens, while
   Antoninus Pius was emperor, while Polycarp was yet living, and while
   Justin and Irenæus were in their prime.

   Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem, speaks of Clement, in turn, as his
   master: "for we acknowledge as fathers those blessed saints who are
   gone before us, and to whom we shall go after a little time the truly
   blest Pantænus, I mean, and the holy Clemens, my teacher, who was to me
   so greatly useful and helpful." St. Cyril of Alexandria calls him "a
   man admirably learned and skilful, and one that searched to the depths
   all the learning of the Greeks, with an exactness rarely attained
   before." So Theodoret says, "He surpassed all others, and was a holy
   man." St. Jerome pronounces him the most learned of all the ancients;
   while Eusebius testifies to his theological attainments, and applauds
   him as an "incomparable master of Christian philosophy." But the rest
   shall be narrated by our translator, Mr. Wilson.

   The following is the original Introductory Notice:--

   Titus Flavius Clemens, the illustrious head of the Catechetical School
   at Alexandria at the close of the second century, was originally a
   pagan philosopher. The date of his birth is unknown. It is also
   uncertain whether Alexandria or Athens was his birthplace. [849]

   On embracing Christianity, he eagerly sought the instructions of its
   most eminent teachers; for this purpose travelling extensively over
   Greece, Italy, Egypt, Palestine, and other regions of the East.

   Only one of these teachers (who, from a reference in the Stromata, all
   appear to have been alive when he wrote [850] ) can be with certainty
   identified, viz., Pantænus, of whom he speaks in terms of profound
   reverence, and whom he describes as the greatest of them all. Returning
   to Alexandria, he succeeded his master Pantænus in the catechetical
   school, probably on the latter departing on his missionary tour to the
   East, somewhere about a.d. 189. [851] He was also made a presbyter of
   the Church, either then or somewhat later. [852] He continued to teach
   with great distinction till a.d. 202, when the persecution under
   Severus compelled him to retire from Alexandria. In the beginning of
   the reign of Caracalla we find him at Jerusalem, even then a great
   resort of Christian, and especially clerical, pilgrims. We also hear of
   him travelling to Antioch, furnished with a letter of recommendation by
   Alexander, bishop of Jerusalem. [853] The close of his career is
   covered with obscurity. He is supposed to have died about a.d. 220.

   Among his pupils were his distinguished successor in the Alexandrian
   school, Origen, Alexander bishop of Jerusalem, and, according to
   Baronius, Combefisius, and Bull, also Hippolytus.

   The above is positively the sum of what we know of Clement's history.

   His three great works, The Exhortation to the Heathen (logos ho
   protreptikos pros Hellenas), The Instructor, or Pædagogus (paidagogos),
   The Miscellanies, or Stromata (Stromateis), are among the most valuable
   remains of Christian antiquity, and the largest that belong to that
   early period.

   The Exhortation, the object of which is to win pagans to the Christian
   faith, contains a complete and withering exposure of the abominable
   licentiousness, the gross imposture and sordidness of paganism. With
   clearness and cogency of argument, great earnestness and eloquence,
   Clement sets forth in contrast the truth as taught in the inspired
   Scriptures, the true God, and especially the personal Christ, the
   living Word of God, the Saviour of men. It is an elaborate and masterly
   work, rich in felicitous classical allusion and quotation, breathing
   throughout the spirit of philosophy and of the Gospel, and abounding in
   passages of power and beauty.

   The Pædagogus, or Instructor, is addressed to those who have been
   rescued from the darkness and pollutions of heathenism, and is an
   exhibition of Christian morals and manners,--a guide for the formation
   and development of Christian character, and for living a Christian
   life. It consists of three books. It is the grand aim of the whole work
   to set before the converts Christ as the only Instructor, and to
   expound and enforce His precepts. In the first book Clement exhibits
   the person, the function, the means, methods, and ends of the
   Instructor, who is the Word and Son of God; and lovingly dwells on His
   benignity and philanthropy, His wisdom, faithfulness, and
   righteousness.

   The second and third books lay down rules for the regulation of the
   Christian, in all the relations, circumstances, and actions of life,
   entering most minutely into the details of dress, eating, drinking,
   bathing, sleeping, etc. The delineation of a life in all respects
   agreeable to the Word, a truly Christian life, attempted here, may, now
   that the Gospel has transformed social and private life to the extent
   it has, appear unnecessary, or a proof of the influence of ascetic
   tendencies. But a code of Christian morals and manners (a sort of
   "whole duty of man" and manual of good breeding combined) was eminently
   needed by those whose habits and characters had been moulded under the
   debasing and polluting influences of heathenism; and who were bound,
   and were aiming, to shape their lives according to the principles of
   the Gospel, in the midst of the all but incredible licentiousness and
   luxury by which society around was incurably tainted. The disclosures
   which Clement, with solemn sternness, and often with caustic wit, makes
   of the prevalent voluptuousness and vice, form a very valuable
   contribution to our knowledge of that period.

   The full title of the Stromata, according to Eusebius and Photius, was
   Titou Phlauiou Klementos ton kata ten alethe philosophian gnostikon
   hupomnematon stromateis [854] --"Titus Flavius Clement's miscellaneous
   collections of speculative (gnostic) notes bearing upon the true
   philosophy." The aim of the work, in accordance with this title, is, in
   opposition to Gnosticism, to furnish the materials for the construction
   of a true gnosis, a Christian philosophy, on the basis of faith, and to
   lead on to this higher knowledge those who, by the discipline of the
   Pædagogus, had been trained for it. The work consisted originally of
   eight books. The eighth book is lost; that which appears under this
   name has plainly no connection with the rest of the Stromata. Various
   accounts have been given of the meaning of the distinctive word in the
   title (Stromateus); but all agree in regarding it as indicating the
   miscellaneous character of its contents. And they are very
   miscellaneous. They consist of the speculations of Greek philosophers,
   of heretics, and of those who cultivated the true Christian gnosis, and
   of quotations from sacred Scripture. The latter he affirms to be the
   source from which the higher Christian knowledge is to be drawn; as it
   was that from which the germs of truth in Plato and the Hellenic
   philosophy were derived. He describes philosophy as a divinely ordered
   preparation of the Greeks for faith in Christ, as the law was for the
   Hebrews; and shows the necessity and value of literature and
   philosophic culture for the attainment of true Christian knowledge, in
   opposition to the numerous body among Christians who regarded learning
   as useless and dangerous. He proclaims himself an eclectic, believing
   in the existence of fragments of truth in all systems, which may be
   separated from error; but declaring that the truth can be found in
   unity and completeness only in Christ, as it was from Him that all its
   scattered germs originally proceeded. The Stromata are written
   carelessly, and even confusedly; but the work is one of prodigious
   learning, and supplies materials of the greatest value for
   understanding the various conflicting systems which Christianity had to
   combat.

   It was regarded so much as the author's great work, that, on the
   testimony of Theodoret, Cassiodorus, and others, we learn that Clement
   received the appellation of Stromateus (the Stromatist). In all
   probability, the first part of it was given to the world about a.d.
   194. The latest date to which he brings down his chronology in the
   first book is the death of Commodus, which happened in a.d. 192; from
   which Eusebius [855] concludes that he wrote this work during the reign
   of Severus, who ascended the imperial throne in a.d. 193, and reigned
   till a.d. 211. It is likely that the whole was composed ere Clement
   quitted Alexandria in a.d. 202. The publication of the Pædagogus
   preceded by a short time that of the Stromata; and the Cohortatio was
   written a short time before the Pædagogus, as is clear from statements
   made by Clement himself.

   So multifarious is the erudition, so multitudinous are the quotations
   and the references to authors in all departments, and of all countries,
   the most of whose works have perished, that the works in question could
   only have been composed near an extensive library--hardly anywhere but
   in the vicinity of the famous library of Alexandria. They are a
   storehouse of curious ancient lore,--a museum of the fossil remains of
   the beauties and monstrosities of the world of pagan antiquity, during
   all the epochs and phases of its history. The three compositions are
   really parts of one whole. The central connecting idea is that of the
   Logos--the Word--the Son of God; whom in the first work he exhibits
   drawing men from the superstitions and corruptions of heathenism to
   faith; in the second, as training them by precepts and discipline; and
   in the last, as conducting them to that higher knowledge of the things
   of God, to which those only who devote themselves assiduously to
   spiritual, moral, and intellectual culture can attain. Ever before his
   eye is the grand form of the living personal Christ,--the Word, who
   "was with God, and who was God, but who became man, and dwelt among
   us."

   Of course there is throughout plenty of false science, and frivolous
   and fanciful speculation.

   Who is the rich man that shall be saved? (tis ho sozomenos plousios;)
   is the title of a practical treatise, in which Clement shows, in
   opposition to those who interpreted our Lord's words to the young ruler
   as requiring the renunciation of worldly goods, that the disposition of
   the soul is the great essential. Of other numerous works of Clement, of
   which only a few stray fragments have been preserved, the chief are the
   eight books of The Hypotyposes, which consisted of expositions of all
   the books of Scripture. Of these we have a few undoubted fragments. The
   Adumbrations, or Commentaries on some of the Catholic Epistles, and The
   Selections from the Prophetic Scriptures, are compositions of the same
   character, as far as we can judge, as The Hypotyposes, and are supposed
   by some to have formed part of that work.

   Other lost works of Clement are:--

   The Treatise of Clement, the Stromatist, on the Prophet Amos.

   On Providence.

   Treatise on Easter.

   On Evil-speaking.

   Discussion on Fasting.

   Exhortation to Patience; or, To the newly baptized.

   Ecclesiastical Canon; or, Against the Judaizers.

   Different Terms.

   The following are the names of treatises which Clement refers to as
   written or about to be written by him, but of which otherwise we have
   no trace or mention:--On First Principles; On Prophecy; On the
   Allegorical Interpretation of Members and Affections when ascribed to
   God; On Angels; On the Devil; On the Origin of the Universe; On the
   Unity and Excellence of the Church; On the Offices of Bishops,
   Presbyters, Deacons, and Widows; On the Soul; On the Resurrection; On
   Marriage; On Continence; Against Heresies.

   Preserved among Clement's works is a fragment called Epitomes of the
   Writings of Theodotus, and of the Eastern Doctrine, most likely
   abridged extracts made by Clement for his own use, and giving
   considerable insight into Gnosticism.

   Clement's quotations from Scripture are made from the Septuagint
   version, often inaccurately from memory, sometimes from a different
   text from what we possess, often with verbal adaptations; and not
   rarely different texts are blended together. [856]

   The works of Clement present considerable difficulties to the
   translator; and one of the chief is the state of the text, which
   greatly needs to be expurgated and amended. For this there are abundant
   materials, in the copious annotations and disquisitions, by various
   hands, collected together in Migne's edition; where, however,
   corruptions the most obvious have been allowed to remain in the text.

   The publishers are indebted to Dr. W. L. Alexander for the poetical
   translations of the Hymns of Clement.

   be well to say here, that Photius himself suggests that heretics had
   corrupted some of his writings, and that his genuine works testify
   against these very corruptions. Dupin thinks that if Clement ever wrote
   such things they much have crept into his works from fragments of his
   earlier writings, while he was a mere Platonist, at most an inquirer
   into Christianity. But his great repute in the Catholic Church after
   his decease, is sufficient to place his character far above all
   suspicions of his having ever swerved from the "faith of the Church."]

      Chapter I.--Exhortation to Abandon the Impious Mysteries of Idolatry for
      the Adoration of the Divine Word and God the Father.

   Amphion of Thebes and Arion of Methymna were both minstrels, and both
   were renowned in story. They are celebrated in song to this day in the
   chorus of the Greeks; the one for having allured the fishes, and the
   other for having surrounded Thebes with walls by the power of music.
   Another, a Thracian, a cunning master of his art (he also is the
   subject of a Hellenic legend), tamed the wild beasts by the mere might
   of song; and transplanted trees--oaks--by music. I might tell you also
   the story of another, a brother to these--the subject of a myth, and a
   minstrel--Eunomos the Locrian and the Pythic grasshopper. A solemn
   Hellenic assembly had met at Pytho, to celebrate the death of the
   Pythic serpent, when Eunomos sang the reptile's epitaph. Whether his
   ode was a hymn in praise of the serpent, or a dirge, I am not able to
   say. But there was a contest, and Eunomos was playing the lyre in the
   summer time: it was when the grasshoppers, warmed by the sun, were
   chirping beneath the leaves along the hills; but they were singing not
   to that dead dragon, but to God All-wise,--a lay unfettered by rule,
   better than the numbers of Eunomos. The Locrian breaks a string. The
   grasshopper sprang on the neck of the instrument, and sang on it as on
   a branch; and the minstrel, adapting his strain to the grasshopper's
   song, made up for the want of the missing string. The grasshopper then
   was attracted by the song of Eunomos, as the fable represents,
   according to which also a brazen statue of Eunomos with his lyre, and
   the Locrian's ally in the contest, was erected at Pytho. But of its own
   accord it flew to the lyre, and of its own accord sang, and was
   regarded by the Greeks as a musical performer.

   How, let me ask, have you believed vain fables and supposed animals to
   be charmed by music; while Truth's shining face alone, as would seem,
   appears to you disguised, and is looked on with incredulous eyes? And
   so Cithæron, and Helicon, and the mountains of the Odrysi, and the
   initiatory rites of the Thracians, mysteries of deceit, are hallowed
   and celebrated in hymns. For me, I am pained at such calamities as form
   the subjects of tragedy, though but myths; but by you the records of
   miseries are turned into dramatic compositions.

   But the dramas and the raving poets, now quite intoxicated, let us
   crown with ivy; and distracted outright as they are, in Bacchic
   fashion, with the satyrs, and the frenzied rabble, and the rest of the
   demon crew, let us confine to Cithæron and Helicon, now antiquated.

   But let us bring from above out of heaven, Truth, with Wisdom in all
   its brightness, and the sacred prophetic choir, down to the holy mount
   of God; and let Truth, darting her light to the most distant points,
   cast her rays all around on those that are involved in darkness, and
   deliver men from delusion, stretching out her very strong [857] right
   hand, which is wisdom, for their salvation. And raising their eyes, and
   looking above, let them abandon Helicon and Cithæron, and take up their
   abode in Sion. "For out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of
   the Lord from Jerusalem," [858] --the celestial Word, the true athlete
   crowned in the theatre of the whole universe. What my Eunomos sings is
   not the measure of Terpander, nor that of Capito, nor the Phrygian, nor
   Lydian, nor Dorian, but the immortal measure of the new harmony which
   bears God's name--the new, the Levitical song. [859]


   "Soother of pain, calmer of wrath, producing forgetfulness of all
   ills." [860]

   Sweet and true is the charm of persuasion which blends with this
   strain.

   To me, therefore, that Thracian Orpheus, that Theban, and that
   Methymnæan,--men, and yet unworthy of the name,--seem to have been
   deceivers, who, under the pretence of poetry corrupting human life,
   possessed by a spirit of artful sorcery for purposes of destruction,
   celebrating crimes in their orgies, and making human woes the materials
   of religious worship, were the first to entice men to idols; nay, to
   build up the stupidity of the nations with blocks of wood and
   stone,--that is, statues and images,--subjecting to the yoke of
   extremest bondage the truly noble freedom of those who lived as free
   citizens under heaven by their songs and incantations. But not such is
   my song, which has come to loose, and that speedily, the bitter bondage
   of tyrannizing demons; and leading us back to the mild and loving yoke
   of piety, recalls to heaven those that had been cast prostrate to the
   earth. It alone has tamed men, the most intractable of animals; the
   frivolous among them answering to the fowls of the air, deceivers to
   reptiles, the irascible to lions, the voluptuous to swine, the
   rapacious to wolves. The silly are stocks and stones, and still more
   senseless than stones is a man who is steeped in ignorance. As our
   witness, let us adduce the voice of prophecy accordant with truth, and
   bewailing those who are crushed in ignorance and folly: "For God is
   able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham;" [861] and He,
   commiserating their great ignorance and hardness of heart who are
   petrified against the truth, has raised up a seed of piety, sensitive
   to virtue, of those stones--of the nations, that is, who trusted in
   stones. Again, therefore, some venomous and false hypocrites, who
   plotted against righteousness, He once called "a brood of vipers."
   [862] But if one of those serpents even is willing to repent, and
   follows the Word, he becomes a man of God.

   Others he figuratively calls wolves, clothed in sheep-skins, meaning
   thereby monsters of rapacity in human form. And so all such most savage
   beasts, and all such blocks of stone, the celestial song has
   transformed into tractable men. "For even we ourselves were sometime
   foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
   living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another." Thus speaks
   the apostolic Scripture: "But after that the kindness and love of God
   our saviour to man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we
   have done, but according to His mercy, He saved us." [863] Behold the
   might of the new song! It has made men out of stones, men out of
   beasts. Those, moreover, that were as dead, not being partakers of the
   true life, have come to life again, simply by becoming listeners to
   this song. It also composed the universe into melodious order, and
   tuned the discord of the elements to harmonious arrangement, so that
   the whole world might become harmony. It let loose the fluid ocean, and
   yet has prevented it from encroaching on the land. The earth, again,
   which had been in a state of commotion, it has established, and fixed
   the sea as its boundary. The violence of fire it has softened by the
   atmosphere, as the Dorian is blended with the Lydian strain; and the
   harsh cold of the air it has moderated by the embrace of fire,
   harmoniously arranging these the extreme tones of the universe. And
   this deathless strain,--the support of the whole and the harmony of
   all,--reaching from the centre to the circumference, and from the
   extremities to the central part, has harmonized this universal frame of
   things, not according to the Thracian music, which is like that
   invented by Jubal, but according to the paternal counsel of God, which
   fired the zeal of David. And He who is of David, and yet before him,
   the Word of God, despising the lyre and harp, which are but lifeless
   instruments, and having tuned by the Holy Spirit the universe, and
   especially man,--who, composed of body and soul, is a universe in
   miniature,--makes melody to God on this instrument of many tones; and
   to this instrument--I mean man--he sings accordant: "For thou art my
   harp, and pipe, and temple." [864] --a harp for harmony--a pipe by
   reason of the Spirit--a temple by reason of the word; so that the first
   may sound, the second breathe, the third contain the Lord. And David
   the king, the harper whom we mentioned a little above, who exhorted to
   the truth and dissuaded from idols, was so far from celebrating demons
   in song, that in reality they were driven away by his music. Thus, when
   Saul was plagued with a demon, he cured him by merely playing. A
   beautiful breathing instrument of music the Lord made man, after His
   own image. And He Himself also, surely, who is the supramundane Wisdom,
   the celestial Word, is the all-harmonious, melodious, holy instrument
   of God. What, then, does this instrument--the Word of God, the Lord,
   the New Song--desire? To open the eyes of the blind, and unstop the
   ears of the deaf, and to lead the lame or the erring to righteousness,
   to exhibit God to the foolish, to put a stop to corruption, to conquer
   death, to reconcile disobedient children to their father. The
   instrument of God loves mankind. The Lord pities, instructs, exhorts,
   admonishes, saves, shields, and of His bounty promises us the kingdom
   of heaven as a reward for learning; and the only advantage He reaps is,
   that we are saved. For wickedness feeds on men's destruction; but
   truth, like the bee, harming nothing, delights only in the salvation of
   men.

   You have, then, God's promise; you have His love: become partaker of
   His grace. And do not suppose the song of salvation to be new, as a
   vessel or a house is new. For "before the morning star it was;" [865]
   and "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
   Word was God." [866] Error seems old, but truth seems a new thing.

   Whether, then, the Phrygians are shown to be the most ancient people by
   the goats of the fable; or, on the other hand, the Arcadians by the
   poets, who describe them as older than the moon; or, finally, the
   Egyptians by those who dream that this land first gave birth to gods
   and men: yet none of these at least existed before the world. But
   before the foundation of the world were we, who, because destined to be
   in Him, pre-existed in the eye of God before,--we the rational
   creatures of the Word of God, on whose account we date from the
   beginning; for "in the beginning was the Word." Well, inasmuch as the
   Word was from the first, He was and is the divine source of all things;
   but inasmuch as He has now assumed the name Christ, consecrated of old,
   and worthy of power, he has been called by me the New Song. This Word,
   then, the Christ, the cause of both our being at first (for He was in
   God) and of our well-being, this very Word has now appeared as man, He
   alone being both, both God and man--the Author of all blessings to us;
   by whom we, being taught to live well, are sent on our way to life
   eternal. For, according to that inspired apostle of the Lord, "the
   grace of God which bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
   teaching us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should
   live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking
   for the blessed hope, and appearing of the glory of the great God and
   our Saviour Jesus Christ." [867]

   This is the New Song, [868] the manifestation of the Word that was in
   the beginning, and before the beginning. The Saviour, who existed
   before, has in recent days appeared. He, who is in Him that truly is,
   has appeared; for the Word, who "was with God," and by whom all things
   were created, has appeared as our Teacher. The Word, who in the
   beginning bestowed on us life as Creator when He formed us, taught us
   to live well when He appeared as our Teacher; that as God He might
   afterwards conduct us to the life which never ends. He did not now for
   the first time pity us for our error; but He pitied us from the first,
   from the beginning. But now, at His appearance, lost as we already
   were, He accomplished our salvation. For that wicked reptile monster,
   by his enchantments, enslaves and plagues men even till now;
   inflicting, as seems to me, such barbarous vengeance on them as those
   who are said to bind the captives to corpses till they rot together.
   This wicked tyrant and serpent, accordingly, binding fast with the
   miserable chain of superstition whomsoever he can draw to his side from
   their birth, to stones, and stocks, and images, and such like idols,
   may with truth be said to have taken and buried living men with those
   dead idols, till both suffer corruption together.

   Therefore (for the seducer is one and the same) he that at the
   beginning brought Eve down to death, now brings thither the rest of
   mankind. Our ally and helper, too, is one and the same--the Lord, who
   from the beginning gave revelations by prophecy, but now plainly calls
   to salvation. In obedience to the apostolic injunction, therefore, let
   us flee from "the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now
   worketh in the children of disobedience," [869] and let us run to the
   Lord the saviour, who now exhorts to salvation, as He has ever done, as
   He did by signs and wonders in Egypt and the desert, both by the bush
   and the cloud, which, through the favour of divine love, attended the
   Hebrews like a handmaid. By the fear which these inspired He addressed
   the hard-hearted; while by Moses, learned in all wisdom, and Isaiah,
   lover of truth, and the whole prophetic choir, in a way appealing more
   to reason, He turns to the Word those who have ears to hear. Sometimes
   He upbraids, and sometimes He threatens. Some men He mourns over,
   others He addresses with the voice of song, just as a good physician
   treats some of his patients with cataplasms, some with rubbing, some
   with fomentations; in one case cuts open with the lancet, in another
   cauterizes, in another amputates, in order if possible to cure the
   patient's diseased part or member. The Saviour has many tones of voice,
   and many methods for the salvation of men; by threatening He
   admonishes, by upbraiding He converts, by bewailing He pities, by the
   voice of song He cheers. He spake by the burning bush, for the men of
   that day needed signs and wonders.

   He awed men by the fire when He made flame to burst from the pillar of
   cloud--a token at once of grace and fear: if you obey, there is the
   light; if you disobey, there is the fire; but since humanity is nobler
   than the pillar or the bush, after them the prophets uttered their
   voice,--the Lord Himself speaking in Isaiah, in Elias,--speaking
   Himself by the mouth of the prophets. But if thou dost not believe the
   prophets, but supposest both the men and the fire a myth, the Lord
   Himself shall speak to thee, "who, being in the form of God, thought it
   not robbery to be equal with God, but humbled Himself," [870] --He, the
   merciful God, exerting Himself to save man. And now the Word Himself
   clearly speaks to thee, shaming thy unbelief; yea, I say, the Word of
   God became man, that thou mayest learn from man how man may become God.
   Is it not then monstrous, my friends, that while God is ceaselessly
   exhorting us to virtue, we should spurn His kindness and reject
   salvation?

   Does not John also invite to salvation, and is he not entirely a voice
   of exhortation? Let us then ask him, "Who of men art thou, and whence?"
   He will not say Elias. He will deny that he is Christ, but will profess
   himself to be "a voice crying in the wilderness." Who, then, is John?
   [871] In a word, we may say, "The beseeching voice of the Word crying
   in the wilderness." What criest thou, O voice? Tell us also. "Make
   straight the paths of the Lord." [872] John is the forerunner, and that
   voice the precursor of the Word; an inviting voice, preparing for
   salvation,--a voice urging men on to the inheritance of the heavens,
   and through which the barren and the desolate is childless no more.
   This fecundity the angel's voice foretold; and this voice was also the
   precursor of the Lord preaching glad tidings to the barren woman, as
   John did to the wilderness. By reason of this voice of the Word,
   therefore, the barren woman bears children, and the desert becomes
   fruitful. The two voices which heralded the Lord's--that of the angel
   and that of John--intimate, as I think, the salvation in store for us
   to be, that on the appearance of this Word we should reap, as the fruit
   of this productiveness, eternal life. The Scripture makes this all
   clear, by referring both the voices to the same thing: "Let her hear
   who has not brought forth, and let her who has not had the pangs of
   childbirth utter her voice: for more are the children of the desolate,
   than of her who hath an husband." [873]

   The angel announced to us the glad tidings of a husband. John entreated
   us to recognise the husbandman, to seek the husband. For this husband
   of the barren woman, and this husbandman of the desert--who filled with
   divine power the barren woman and the desert--is one and the same. For
   because many were the children of the mother of noble rule, yet the
   Hebrew woman, once blessed with many children, was made childless
   because of unbelief: the barren woman receives the husband, and the
   desert the husbandman; then both become mothers through the word, the
   one of fruits, the other of believers. But to the unbelieving the
   barren and the desert are still reserved. For this reason John, the
   herald of the Word, besought men to make themselves ready against the
   coming of the Christ of God. [874] And it was this which was signified
   by the dumbness of Zacharias, which waited for fruit in the person of
   the harbinger of Christ, that the Word, the light of truth, by becoming
   the Gospel, might break the mystic silence of the prophetic enigmas.
   But if thou desirest truly to see God, take to thyself means of
   purification worthy of Him, not leaves of laurel fillets interwoven
   with wool and purple; but wreathing thy brows with righteousness, and
   encircling them with the leaves of temperance, set thyself earnestly to
   find Christ. "For I am," He says, "the door," [875] which we who desire
   to understand God must discover, that He may throw heaven's gates wide
   open to us. For the gates of the Word being intellectual, are opened by
   the key of faith. No one knows God but the Son, and he to whom the Son
   shall reveal Him. [876] And I know well that He who has opened the door
   hitherto shut, will afterwards reveal what is within; and will show
   what we could not have known before, had we not entered in by Christ,
   through whom alone God is beheld.

      Chapter II.--The Absurdity and Impiety of the Heathen Mysteries and Fables
      About the Birth and Death of Their Gods.

   Explore not then too curiously the shrines of impiety, or the mouths of
   caverns full of monstrosity, or the Thesprotian caldron, or the
   Cirrhæan tripod, or the Dodonian copper. The Gerandryon, [877] once
   regarded sacred in the midst of desert sands, and the oracle there gone
   to decay with the oak itself, consigned to the region of antiquated
   fables. The fountain of Castalia is silent, and the other fountain of
   Colophon; and, in like manner, all the rest of the springs of
   divination are dead, and stripped of their vainglory, although at a
   late date, are shown with their fabulous legends to have run dry.
   Recount to us also the useless [878] oracles of that other kind of
   divination, or rather madness, the Clarian, the Pythian, the Didymæan,
   that of Amphiaraus, of Apollo, of Amphilochus; and if you will, couple
   [879] with them the expounders of prodigies, the augurs, and the
   interpreters of dreams. And bring and place beside the Pythian those
   that divine by flour, and those that divine by barley, and the
   ventriloquists still held in honour by many. Let the secret shrines of
   the Egyptians and the necromancies of the Etruscans be consigned to
   darkness. Insane devices truly are they all of unbelieving men. Goats,
   too, have been confederates in this art of soothsaying, trained to
   divination; and crows taught by men to give oracular responses to men.

   And what if I go over the mysteries? I will not divulge them in
   mockery, as they say Alcibiades did, but I will expose right well by
   the word of truth the sorcery hidden in them; and those so-called gods
   of yours, whose are the mystic rites, I shall display, as it were, on
   the stage of life, to the spectators of truth. The bacchanals hold
   their orgies in honour of the frenzied Dionysus, celebrating their
   sacred frenzy by the eating of raw flesh, and go through the
   distribution of the parts of butchered victims, crowned with snakes,
   shrieking out the name of that Eva by whom error came into the world.
   The symbol of the Bacchic orgies is a consecrated serpent. Moreover,
   according to the strict interpretation of the Hebrew term, the name
   Hevia, aspirated, signifies a female serpent.

   Demeter and Proserpine have become the heroines of a mystic drama; and
   their wanderings, and seizure, and grief, Eleusis celebrates by
   torchlight processions. I think that the derivation of orgies and
   mysteries ought to be traced, the former to the wrath (orge) of Demeter
   against Zeus, the latter to the nefarious wickedness (musos) relating
   to Dionysus; but if from Myus of Attica, who Pollodorus says was killed
   in hunting--no matter, I don't grudge your mysteries the glory of
   funeral honours. You may understand mysteria in another way, as
   mytheria (hunting fables), the letters of the two words being
   interchanged; for certainly fables of this sort hunt after the most
   barbarous of the Thracians, the most senseless of the Phrygians, and
   the superstitious among the Greeks.

   Perish, then, the man who was the author of this imposture among men,
   be he Dardanus, who taught the mysteries of the mother of the gods, or
   Eetion, who instituted the orgies and mysteries of the Samothracians,
   or that Phrygian Midas who, having learned the cunning imposture from
   Odrysus, communicated it to his subjects. For I will never be persuaded
   by that Cyprian Islander Cinyras, who dared to bring forth from night
   to the light of day the lewd orgies of Aphrodité in his eagerness to
   deify a strumpet of his own country. Others say that Melampus the son
   of Amythaon imported the festivals of Ceres from Egypt into Greece,
   celebrating her grief in song.

   These I would instance as the prime authors of evil, the parents of
   impious fables and of deadly superstition, who sowed in human life that
   seed of evil and ruin--the mysteries.

   And now, for it is time, I will prove their orgies to be full of
   imposture and quackery. And if you have been initiated, you will laugh
   all the more at these fables of yours which have been held in honour. I
   publish without reserve what has been involved in secrecy, not ashamed
   to tell what you are not ashamed to worship.

   There is then the foam-born and Cyprus-born, the darling of Cinyras,--I
   mean Aphrodité, lover of the virilia, because sprung from them, even
   from those of Uranus, that were cut off,--those lustful members, that,
   after being cut off, offered violence to the waves. Of members so lewd
   a worthy fruit--Aphrodité--is born. In the rites which celebrate this
   enjoyment of the sea, as a symbol of her birth a lump of salt and the
   phallus are handed to those who are initiated into the art of
   uncleanness. And those initiated bring a piece of money to her, as a
   courtesan's paramours do to her.

   Then there are the mysteries of Demeter, and Zeus's wanton embraces of
   his mother, and the wrath of Demeter; I know not what for the future I
   shall call her, mother or wife, on which account it is that she is
   called Brimo, as is said; also the entreaties of Zeus, and the drink of
   gall, the plucking out of the hearts of sacrifices, and deeds that we
   dare not name. Such rites the Phrygians perform in honour of Attis and
   Cybele and the Corybantes. And the story goes, that Zeus, having torn
   away the orchites of a ram, brought them out and cast them at the
   breasts of Demeter, paying thus a fraudulent penalty for his violent
   embrace, pretending to have cut out his own. The symbols of initiation
   into these rites, when set before you in a vacant hour, I know will
   excite your laughter, although on account of the exposure by no means
   inclined to laugh. "I have eaten out of the drum, I have drunk out of
   the cymbal, I have carried the Cernos, [880] I have slipped into the
   bedroom." Are not these tokens a disgrace? Are not the mysteries
   absurdity?

   What if I add the rest? Demeter becomes a mother, Core [881] is reared
   up to womanhood. And, in course of time, he who begot her,--this same
   Zeus has intercourse with his own daughter Pherephatta,--after Ceres,
   the mother,--forgetting his former abominable wickedness. Zeus is both
   the father and the seducer of Core, and shamefully courts her in the
   shape of a dragon; his identity, however, was discovered. The token of
   the Sabazian mysteries to the initiated is "the deity gliding over the
   breast,"--the deity being this serpent crawling over the breasts of the
   initiated. Proof surely this of the unbridled lust of Zeus. Pherephatta
   has a child, though, to be sure, in the form of a bull, as an
   idolatrous poet says,--


   "The bull

   The dragon's father, and the father of the bull the dragon,

   On a hill the herdsman's hidden ox-goad,"--

   alluding, as I believe, under the name of the herdsman's ox-goad, to
   the reed wielded by bacchanals. Do you wish me to go into the story of
   Persephatta's gathering of flowers, her basket, and her seizure by
   Pluto (Aidoneus), and the rent in the earth, and the swine of Eubouleus
   that were swallowed up with the two goddesses; for which reason, in the
   Thesmophoria, speaking the Megaric tongue, they thrust out swine? This
   mythological story the women celebrate variously in different cities in
   the festivals called Thesmophoria and Scirophoria; dramatizing in many
   forms the rape of Pherephatta or Persephatta (Proserpine).

   The mysteries of Dionysus are wholly inhuman; for while still a child,
   and the Curetes danced around [his cradle] clashing their weapons, and
   the Titans having come upon them by stealth, and having beguiled him
   with childish toys, these very Titans tore him limb from limb when but
   a child, as the bard of this mystery, the Thracian Orpheus, says:--


   "Cone, and spinning-top, and limb-moving rattles,

   And fair golden apples from the clear-toned Hesperides."

   And the useless symbols of this mystic rite it will not be useless to
   exhibit for condemnation. These are dice, ball, hoop, apples, top,
   [882] looking-glass, tuft of wool.

   Athené (Minerva), to resume our account, having abstracted the heart of
   Dionysus, was called Pallas, from the vibrating of the heart; and the
   Titans who had torn him limb from limb, setting a caldron on a tripod,
   and throwing into it the members of Dionysus, first boiled them down,
   and then fixing them on spits, "held them over the fire." But Zeus
   having appeared, since he was a god, having speedily perceived the
   savour of the pieces of flesh that were being cooked,--that savour
   which your gods agree to have assigned to them as their
   perquisite,--assails the Titans with his thunderbolt, and consigns the
   members of Dionysus to his son Apollo to be interred. And he--for he
   did not disobey Zeus--bore the dismembered corpse to Parnassus, and
   there deposited it.

   If you wish to inspect the orgies of the Corybantes, then know that,
   having killed their third brother, they covered the head of the dead
   body with a purple cloth, crowned it, and carrying it on the point of a
   spear, buried it under the roots of Olympus. These mysteries are, in
   short, murders and funerals. And the priests of these rites, who are
   called kings of the sacred rites by those whose business it is to name
   them, give additional strangeness to the tragic occurrence, by
   forbidding parsley with the roots from being placed on the table, for
   they think that parsley grew from the Corybantic blood that flowed
   forth; just as the women, in celebrating the Thesmophoria, abstain from
   eating the seeds of the pomegranate which have fallen on the ground,
   from the idea that pomegranates sprang from the drops of the blood of
   Dionysus. Those Corybantes also they call Cabiric; and the ceremony
   itself they announce as the Cabiric mystery.

   For those two identical fratricides, having abstracted the box in which
   the phallus of Bacchus was deposited, took it to Etruria--dealers in
   honourable wares truly. They lived there as exiles, employing
   themselves in communicating the precious teaching of their
   superstition, and presenting phallic symbols and the box for the
   Tyrrhenians to worship. And some will have it, not improbably, that for
   this reason Dionysus was called Attis, because he was mutilated. And
   what is surprising at the Tyrrhenians, who were barbarians, being thus
   initiated into these foul indignities, when among the Athenians, and in
   the whole of Greece--I blush to say it--the shameful legend about
   Demeter holds its ground? For Demeter, wandering in quest of her
   daughter Core, broke down with fatigue near Eleusis, a place in Attica,
   and sat down on a well overwhelmed with grief. This is even now
   prohibited to those who are initiated, lest they should appear to mimic
   the weeping goddess. The indigenous inhabitants then occupied Eleusis:
   their names were Baubo, and Dusaules, and Triptolemus; and besides,
   Eumolpus and Eubouleus. Triptolemus was a herdsman, Eumolpus a
   shepherd, and Eubouleus a swineherd; from whom came the race of the
   Eumolpidæ and that of the Heralds--a race of Hierophants--who
   flourished at Athens.

   Well, then (for I shall not refrain from the recital), Baubo having
   received Demeter hospitably, reaches to her a refreshing draught; and
   on her refusing it, not having any inclination to drink (for she was
   very sad), and Baubo having become annoyed, thinking herself slighted,
   uncovered her shame, and exhibited her nudity to the goddess. Demeter
   is delighted at the sight, and takes, though with difficulty, the
   draught--pleased, I repeat, at the spectacle. These are the secret
   mysteries of the Athenians; these Orpheus records. I shall produce the
   very words of Orpheus, that you may have the great authority on the
   mysteries himself, as evidence for this piece of turpitude:--


   "Having thus spoken, she drew aside her garments,

   And showed all that shape of the body which it is improper to name,

   And with her own hand Baubo stripped herself under the breasts.

   Blandly then the goddess laughed and laughed in her mind,

   And received the glancing cup in which was the draught."

   And the following is the token of the Eleusinian mysteries: I have
   fasted, I have drunk the cup; I have received from the box; having
   done, I put it into the basket, and out of the basket into the chest.
   [883] Fine sights truly, and becoming a goddess; mysteries worthy of
   the night, and flame, and the magnanimous or rather silly people of the
   Erechthidæ and the other Greeks besides, "whom a fate they hope not for
   awaits after death." And in truth against these Heraclitus the Ephesian
   prophesies, as "the night-walkers, the magi, the bacchanals, the Lenæn
   revellers, the initiated." These he threatens with what will follow
   death, and predicts for them fire. For what are regarded among men as
   mysteries, they celebrate sacrilegiously. Law, then, and opinion, are
   nugatory. And the mysteries of the dragon are an imposture, which
   celebrates religiously mysteries that are no mysteries at all, and
   observes with a spurious piety profane rites. What are these mystic
   chests?--for I must expose their sacred things, and divulge things not
   fit for speech. Are they not sesame cakes, and pyramidal cakes, and
   globular and flat cakes, embossed all over, and lumps of salt, and a
   serpent the symbol of Dionysus Bassareus? And besides these, are they
   not pomegranates, and branches, and rods, and ivy leaves? and besides,
   round cakes and poppy seeds? And further, there are the unmentionable
   symbols of Themis, marjoram, a lamp, a sword, a woman's comb, which is
   a euphemism and mystic expression for the muliebria.

   O unblushing shamelessness! Once on a time night was silent, a veil for
   the pleasure of temperate men; but now for the initiated, the holy
   night is the tell-tale of the rites of licentiousness; and the glare of
   torches reveals vicious indulgences. Quench the flame, O Hierophant;
   reverence, O Torch-bearer, the torches. That light exposes Iacchus; let
   thy mysteries be honoured, and command the orgies to be hidden in night
   and darkness. [884]

   The fire dissembles not; it exposes and punishes what it is bidden.

   Such are the mysteries of the Atheists. [885] And with reason I call
   those Atheists who know not the true God, and pay shameless worship to
   a boy torn in pieces by the Titans, and a woman in distress, and to
   parts of the body that in truth cannot be mentioned for shame, held
   fast as they are in the double impiety, first in that they know not
   God, not acknowledging as God Him who truly is; the other and second is
   the error of regarding those who exist not, as existing and calling
   those gods that have no real existence, or rather no existence at all,
   who have nothing but a name. Wherefore the apostle reproves us, saying,
   "And ye were strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and
   without God in the world." [886]

   All honour to that king of the Scythians, whoever Anacharsis was, who
   shot with an arrow one of his subjects who imitated among the Scythians
   the mystery of the Mother of the gods, as practiced by the inhabitants
   of Cyzicus, beating a drum and sounding a cymbal strung from his neck
   like a priest of Cybele, condemning him as having become effeminate
   among the Greeks, and a teacher of the disease of effeminacy to the
   rest of the Cythians.

   Wherefore (for I must by no means conceal it) I cannot help wondering
   how Euhemerus of Agrigentum, and Nicanor of Cyprus, and Diagoras, and
   Hippo of Melos, and besides these, that Cyrenian of the name of
   Theodorus, and numbers of others, who lived a sober life, and had a
   clearer insight than the rest of the world into the prevailing error
   respecting those gods, were called Atheists; for if they did not arrive
   at the knowledge of the truth, they certainly suspected the error of
   the common opinion; which suspicion is no insignificant seed, and
   becomes the germ of true wisdom. One of these charges the Egyptians
   thus: "If you believe them to be gods, do not mourn or bewail them; and
   if you mourn and bewail them, do not any more regard them as gods." And
   another, taking an image of Hercules made of wood (for he happened most
   likely to be cooking something at home), said, "Come now, Hercules; now
   is the time to undergo for us this thirteenth labour, as you did the
   twelve for Eurystheus, and make this ready for Diagoras," and so cast
   it into the fire as a log of wood. For the extremes of ignorance are
   atheism and superstition, from which we must endeavour to keep. And do
   you not see Moses, the hierophant of the truth, enjoining that no
   eunuch, or emasculated man, or son of a harlot, should enter the
   congregation? By the two first he alludes to the impious custom by
   which men were deprived both of divine energy and of their virility;
   and by the third, to him who, in place of the only real God, assumes
   many gods falsely so called,--as the son of a harlot, in ignorance of
   his true father, may claim many putative fathers.

   There was an innate original communion between men and heaven, obscured
   through ignorance, but which now at length has leapt forth
   instantaneously from the darkness, and shines resplendent; as has been
   expressed by one [887] in the following lines:--


   "See'st thou this lofty, this boundless ether,

   Holding the earth in the embrace of its humid arms."

   And in these:--


   "O Thou, who makest the earth Thy chariot, and in the earth hast Thy
   seat,

   Whoever Thou be, baffling our efforts to behold Thee."

   And whatever else the sons of the poets sing.

   But sentiments erroneous, and deviating from what is right, and
   certainly pernicious, have turned man, a creature of heavenly origin,
   away from the heavenly life, and stretched him on the earth, by
   inducing him to cleave to earthly objects. For some, beguiled by the
   contemplation of the heavens, and trusting to their sight alone, while
   they looked on the motions of the stars, straightway were seized with
   admiration, and deified them, calling the stars gods from their motion
   (theos from thein); and worshipped the sun,--as, for example, the
   Indians; and the moon, as the Phrygians. Others, plucking the benignant
   fruits of earth-born plants, called grain Demeter, as the Athenians,
   and the vine Dionysus, as the Thebans. Others, considering the
   penalties of wickedness, deified them, worshipping various forms of
   retribution and calamity. Hence the Erinnyes, and the Eumenides, and
   the piacular deities, and the judges and avengers of crime, are the
   creations of the tragic poets.

   And some even of the philosophers, after the poets, make idols of forms
   of the affections in your breasts,--such as fear, and love, and joy,
   and hope; as, to be sure, Epimenides of old, who raised at Athens the
   altars of Insult and Impudence. Other objects deified by men take their
   rise from events, and are fashioned in bodily shape, such as a Dike, a
   Clotho, and Lachesis, and Atropos, and Heimarmene, and Auxo, and
   Thallo, which are Attic goddesses. There is a sixth mode of introducing
   error and of manufacturing gods, according to which they number the
   twelve gods, whose birth is the theme of which Hesiod sings in his
   Theogony, and of whom Homer speaks in all that he says of the gods. The
   last mode remains (for there are seven in all)--that which takes its
   rise from the divine beneficence towards men. For, not understanding
   that it is God that does us good, they have invented saviours in the
   persons of the Dioscuri, and Hercules the averter of evil, and
   Asclepius the healer. These are the slippery and hurtful deviations
   from the truth which draw man down from heaven, and cast him into the
   abyss. I wish to show thoroughly what like these gods of yours are,
   that now at length you may abandon your delusion, and speed your flight
   back to heaven. "For we also were once children of wrath, even as
   others; but God, being rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith He
   loved us, when we were now dead in trespasses, quickened us together
   with Christ." [888] For the Word is living, and having been buried with
   Christ, is exalted with God. But those who are still unbelieving are
   called children of wrath, reared for wrath. We who have been rescued
   from error, and restored to the truth, are no longer the nurslings of
   wrath. Thus, therefore, we who were once the children of lawlessness,
   have through the philanthropy of the Word now become the sons of God.

   But to you a poet of your own, Empedocles of Agrigentum, comes and
   says:--


   "Wherefore, distracted with grievous evils,

   You will never ease your soul of its miserable woes."

   The most of what is told of your gods is fabled and invented; and those
   things which are supposed to have taken place, are recorded of vile men
   who lived licentious lives:--


   "You walk in pride and madness,

   And leaving the right and straight path, you have gone away

   Through thorns and briars. Why do ye wander?

   Cease, foolish men, from mortals;

   Leave the darkness of night, and lay hold on the light."

   These counsels the Sibyl, who is at once prophetic and poetic, enjoins
   on us; and truth enjoins them on us too, stripping the crowd of deities
   of those terrifying and threatening masks of theirs, disproving the
   rash opinions formed of them by showing the similarity of names. For
   there are those who reckon three Jupiters: him of Æther in Arcadia, and
   the other two sons of Kronos; and of these, one in Crete, and the
   others again in Arcadia. And there are those that reckon five Athenes:
   the Athenian, the daughter of Hephæstus; the second, the Egyptian, the
   daughter of Nilus; the third the inventor of war, the daughter of
   Kronos; the fourth, the daughter of Zeus, whom the Messenians have
   named Coryphasia, from her mother; above all, the daughter of Pallas
   and Titanis, the daughter of Oceanus, who, having wickedly killed her
   father, adorned herself with her father's skin, as if it had been the
   fleece of a sheep. Further, Aristotle calls the first Apollo, the son
   of Hephæstus and Athene (consequently Athene is no more a virgin); the
   second, that in Crete, the son of Corybas; the third, the son Zeus; the
   fourth, the Arcadian, the son of Silenus (this one is called by the
   Arcadians Nomius); and in addition to these, he specifies the Libyan
   Apollo, the son of Ammon; and to these Didymus the grammarian adds a
   sixth, the son of Magnes. And now how many Apollos are there? They are
   numberless, mortal men, all helpers of their fellow-men who similarly
   with those already mentioned have been so called. And what were I to
   mention the many Asclepiuses, or all the Mercuries that are reckoned
   up, or the Vulcans of fable? Shall I not appear extravagant, deluging
   your ears with these numerous names?

   At any rate, the native countries of your gods, and their arts and
   lives, and besides especially their sepulchres, demonstrate them to
   have been men. Mars, accordingly, who by the poets is held in the
   highest possible honour:--


   "Mars, Mars, bane of men, blood-stained stormer of walls," [889] --

   this deity, always changing sides, and implacable, as Epicharmus says,
   was a Spartan; Sophocles knew him for a Thracian; others say he was an
   Arcadian. This god, Homer says, was bound thirteen months:--


   "Mars had his suffering; by Alöeus' sons,

   Otus and Ephialtes, strongly bound,

   He thirteen months in brazen fetters lay." [890]

   Good luck attend the Carians, who sacrifice dogs to him! And may the
   Scythians never leave off sacrificing asses, as Apollodorus and
   Callimachus relate:--


   "Phoebus rises propitious to the Hyperboreans,

   Then they offer sacrifices of asses to him."

   And the same in another place:--


   "Fat sacrifices of asses' flesh delight Phoebus."

   Hephæstus, whom Jupiter cast from Olympus, from its divine threshold,
   having fallen on Lemnos, practiced the art of working in brass, maimed
   in his feet:--


   "His tottering knees were bowed beneath his weight." [891]

   You have also a doctor, and not only a brass-worker among the gods. And
   the doctor was greedy of gold; Asclepius was his name. I shall produce
   as a witness your own poet, the Boeotian Pindar:--


   "Him even the gold glittering in his hands,

   Amounting to a splendid fee, persuaded

   To rescue a man, already death's capture, from his grasp;

   But Saturnian Jove, having shot his bolt through both,

   Quickly took the breath from their breasts,

   And his flaming thunderbolt sealed their doom."

   And Euripides:--


   "For Zeus was guilty of the murder of my son

   Asclepius, by casting the lightning flame at his breast."

   He therefore lies struck with lightning in the regions of Cynosuris.
   Philochorus also says, that Poseidon was worshipped as a physician in
   Tenos; and that Kronos settled in Sicily, and there was buried.
   Patroclus the Thurian, and Sophocles the younger, in three tragedies,
   have told the story of the Dioscuri; and these Dioscuri were only two
   mortals, if Homer is worthy of of credit:--


   "  .  .  .  .  .  . but they beneath the teeming earth,

   In Lacedæmon lay, their native land." [892]

   And, in addition, he who wrote the Cyprian poems says Castor was
   mortal, and death was decreed to him by fate; but Pollux was immortal,
   being the progeny of Mars. This he has poetically fabled. But Homer is
   more worthy of credit, who spoke as above of both the Dioscuri; and,
   besides, proved Herucles to be a mere phantom:--


   "The man Hercules, expert in mighty deeds."

   Hercules, therefore, was known by Homer himself as only a mortal man.
   And Hieronymus the philosopher describes the make of his body, as tall,
   [893] bristling-haired, robust; and Dicærchus says that he was
   square-built, muscular, dark, hook-nosed, with greyish eyes and long
   hair. This Hercules, accordingly, after living fifty-two years, came to
   his end, and was burned in a funeral pyre in OEta.

   As for the Muses, whom Alcander calls the daughters of Zeus and
   Mnemosyne, and the rest of the poets and authors deify and
   worship,--those Muses, in honour of whom whole states have already
   erected museums, being handmaids, were hired by Megaclo, the daughter
   of Macar. This Macar reigned over the Lesbians, and was always
   quarrelling with his wife; and Megaclo was vexed for her mother's sake.
   What would she not do on her account? Accordingly she hires those
   handmaids, being so many in number, and calls them Mysæ, according to
   the dialect of the Æolians. These she taught to sing deeds of the olden
   time, and play melodiously on the lyre. And they, by assiduously
   playing the lyre, and singing sweetly to it, soothed Macar, and put a
   stop to his ill-temper. Wherefore Megaclo, as a token of gratitude to
   them, on her mother's account erected brazen pillars, and ordered them
   to be held in honour in all the temples. Such, then, are the Muses.
   This account is in Myrsilus of Lesbos.

   And now, then, hear the loves of your gods, and the incredible tales of
   their licentiousness, and their wounds, and their bonds, and their
   laughings, and their fights, their servitudes too, and their banquets;
   and furthermore, their embraces, and tears, and sufferings, and lewd
   delights. Call me Poseidon, and the troop of damsels deflowered by him,
   Amphitrite, Amymone, Alope, Melanippe, Alcyone, Hippothoe, Chione, and
   myriads of others; with whom, though so many, the passions of your
   Poseidon were not satiated.

   Call me Apollo; this is Phoebus, both a holy prophet and a good
   adviser. But Sterope will not say that, nor Æthousa, nor Arsinoe, nor
   Zeuxippe, nor Prothoe, nor Marpissa, nor Hypsipyle. For Daphne alone
   escaped the prophet and seduction.

   And, above all, let the father of gods and men, according to you,
   himself come, who was so given to sexual pleasure, as to lust after
   all, and indulge his lust on all, like the goats of the Thmuitæ. And
   thy poems, O Homer, fill me with admiration!


   "He said, and nodded with his shadowy brows;

   Waved on the immortal head the ambrosial locks,

   And all Olympus trembled at his nod." [894]

   Thou makest Zeus venerable, O Homer; and the nod which thou dost
   ascribe to him is most reverend. But show him only a woman's girdle,
   and Zeus is exposed, and his locks are dishonoured. To what a pitch of
   licentiousness did that Zeus of yours proceed, who spent so many nights
   in voluptuousness with Alcmene? For not even these nine nights were
   long to this insatiable monster. But, on the contrary, a whole lifetime
   were short enough for his lust; that he might beget for us the
   evil-averting god.

   Hercules, the son of Zeus--a true son of Zeus--was the offspring of
   that long night, who with hard toil accomplished the twelve labours in
   a long time, but in one night deflowered the fifty daughters of
   Thestius, and thus was at once the debaucher and the bridegroom of so
   many virgins. It is not, then, without reason that the poets call him a
   cruel wretch and a nefarious scoundrel. It were tedious to recount his
   adulteries of all sorts, and debauching of boys. For your gods did not
   even abstain from boys, one having loved Hylas, another Hyacinthus,
   another Pelops, another Chrysippus, and another Ganymede. Let such gods
   as these be worshipped by your wives, and let them pray that their
   husbands be such as these--so temperate; that, emulating them in the
   same practices, they may be like the gods. Such gods let your boys be
   trained to worship, that they may grow up to be men with the accursed
   likeness of fornication on them received from the gods.

   But it is only the male deities, perhaps, that are impetuous in sexual
   indulgence.

   "The female deities stayed each in the house, for shame," [895] says
   Homer; the goddesses blushing, for modesty's sake, to look on Aphrodité
   when she had been guilty of adultery. But these are more passionately
   licentious, bound in the chains of adultery; Eos having disgraced
   herself with Tithonus, Selene with Endymion, Nereis with Æacus, Thetis
   with Peleus, Demeter with Jason, Persephatta with Adonis. And Aphrodité
   having disgraced herself with Ares, crossed over to Cinyra and married
   Anchises, and laid snares for Phaëthon, and loved Adonis. She contended
   with the ox-eyed Juno; and the goddesses un-robed for the sake of the
   apple, and presented themselves naked before the shepherd, that he
   might decide which was the fairest.

   But come, let us briefly go the round of the games, and do away with
   those solemn assemblages at tombs, the Isthmian, Nemean, and Pythian,
   and finally the Olympian. At Pytho the Pythian dragon is worshipped,
   and the festival-assemblage of the serpent is called by the name
   Pythia. At the Isthmus the sea spit out a piece of miserable refuse;
   and the Isthmian games bewail Melicerta.

   At Nemea another--a little boy, Archemorus--was buried; and the funeral
   games of the child are called Nemea. Pisa is the grave of the Phrygian
   charioteer, O Hellenes of all tribes; and the Olympian games, which are
   nothing else than the funeral sacrifices of Pelops, the Zeus of Phidias
   claims for himself. The mysteries were then, as is probable, games held
   in honour of the dead; so also were the oracles, and both became
   public. But the mysteries at Sagra [896] and in Alimus of Attica were
   confined to Athens. But those contests and phalloi consecrated to
   Dionysus were a world's shame, pervading life with their deadly
   influence. For Dionysus, eagerly desiring to descend to Hades, did not
   know the way; a man, by name Prosymnus, offers to tell him, not without
   reward. The reward was a disgraceful one, though not so in the opinion
   of Dionysus: it was an Aphrodisian favour that was asked of Dionysus as
   a reward. The god was not reluctant to grant the request made to him,
   and promises to fulfil it should he return, and confirms his promise
   with an oath. Having learned the way, he departed and again returned:
   he did not find Prosymnus, for he had died. In order to acquit himself
   of his promise to his lover, he rushes to his tomb, and burns with
   unnatural lust. Cutting a fig-branch that came to his hand, he shaped
   the phallus, and so performed his promise to the dead man. As a mystic
   memorial of this incident, phalloi are raised aloft in honour of
   Dionysus through the various cities. "For did they not make a
   procession in honour of Dionysus, and sing most shameless songs in
   honour of the pudenda, all would go wrong," says Heraclitus. This is
   that Pluto and Dionysus in whose honour they give themselves up to
   frenzy, and play the bacchanal,--not so much, in my opinion, for the
   sake of intoxication, as for the sake of the shameless ceremonial
   practiced. With reason, therefore, such as have become slaves of their
   passions are your gods!

   Furthermore, like the Helots among the Lacedemonians, Apollo came under
   the yoke of slavery to Admetus in Pheræ, Hercules to Omphale in Sardis.
   Poseidon was a drudge to Laomedon; and so was Apollo, who, like a
   good-for-nothing servant, was unable to obtain his freedom from his
   former master; and at that time the walls of Troy were built by them
   for the Phrygian. And Homer is not ashamed to speak of Athene as
   appearing to Ulysses with a golden lamp in her hand. And we read of
   Aphrodite, like a wanton serving-wench, taking and setting a seat for
   Helen opposite the adulterer, in order to entice him.

   Panyasis, too, tells us of gods in plenty besides those who acted as
   servants, writing thus:--


   "Demeter underwent servitude, and so did the famous lame god;

   Poseidon underwent it, and Apollo too, of the silver bow,

   With a mortal man for a year. And fierce Mars

   Underwent it at the compulsion of his father."

   And so on.

   Agreeably to this, it remains for me to bring before you those amatory
   and sensuous deities of yours, as in every respect having human
   feelings.


   "For theirs was a mortal body."

   This Homer most distinctly shows, by introducing Aphrodite uttering
   loud and shrill cries on account of her wound; and describing the most
   warlike Ares himself as wounded in the stomach by Diomede. Polemo, too,
   says that Athene was wounded by Ornytus; nay, Homer says that Pluto
   even was struck with an arrow by Hercules; and Panyasis relates that
   the beams of Sol were struck by the arrows of Hercules; [897] and the
   same Panyasis relates, that by the same Hercules Hera the goddess of
   marriage was wounded in sandy Pylos. Sosibius, too, relates that
   Hercules was wounded in the hand by the sons of Hippocoon. And if there
   are wounds, there is blood. For the ichor of the poets is more
   repulsive than blood; for the putrefaction of blood is called ichor.
   Wherefore cures and means of sustenance of which they stand in need
   must be furnished. Accordingly mention is made of tables, and
   potations, and laughter, and intercourse; for men would not devote
   themselves to love, or beget children, or sleep, if they were immortal,
   and had no wants, and never grew old. Jupiter himself, when the guest
   of Lycaon the Arcadian, partook of a human table among the
   Ethiopians--a table rather inhuman and forbidden. For he satiated
   himself with human flesh unwittingly; for the god did not know that
   Lycaon the Arcadian, his entertainer, had slain his son (his name was
   Nyctimus), and served him up cooked before Zeus.

   This is Jupiter the good, the prophetic, the patron of hospitality, the
   protector of suppliants, the benign, the author of omens, the avenger
   of wrongs; rather the unjust, the violater of right and of law, the
   impious, the inhuman, the violent, the seducer, the adulterer, the
   amatory. But perhaps when he was such he was a man; but now these
   fables seem to have grown old on our hands. Zeus is no longer a
   serpent, a swan, nor an eagle, nor a licentious man; the god no longer
   flies, nor loves boys, nor kisses, nor offers violence, although there
   are still many beautiful women, more comely than Leda, more blooming
   than Semele, and boys of better looks and manners than the Phrygian
   herdsman. Where is now that eagle? where now that swan? where now is
   Zeus himself? He has grown old with his feathers; for as yet he does
   not repent of his amatory exploits, nor is he taught continence. The
   fable is exposed before you: Leda is dead, the swan is dead. Seek your
   Jupiter. Ransack not heaven, but earth. The Cretan, in whose country he
   was buried, will show him to you,--I mean Callimachus, in his hymns:--


   "For thy tomb, O king,

   The Cretans fashioned!"

   For Zeus is dead, be not distressed, as Leda is dead, and the swan, and
   the eagle, and the libertine, and the serpent. And now even the
   superstitious seem, although reluctantly, yet truly, to have come to
   understand their error respecting the Gods.


   "For not from an ancient oak, nor from a rock,

   But from men, is thy descent." [898]

   But shortly after this, they will be found to be but oaks and stones.
   One Agamemnon is said by Staphylus to be worshipped as a Jupiter in
   Sparta; and Phanocles, in his book of the Brave and Fair, relates that
   Agamemnon king of the Hellenes erected the temple of Argennian
   Aphrodite, in honour of Argennus his friend. An Artemis, named the
   Strangled, is worshipped by the Arcadians, as Callimachus says in his
   Book of Causes; and at Methymna another Artemis had divine honours paid
   her, viz., Artemis Condylitis. There is also the temple of another
   Artemis--Artemis Podagra (or, the gout)--in Laconica, as Sosibius says.
   Polemo tells of an image of a yawning Apollo; and again of another
   image, reverenced in Elis, of the guzzling Apollo. Then the Eleans
   sacrifice to Zeus, the averter of flies; and the Romans sacrifice to
   Hercules, the averter of flies; and to Fever, and to Terror, whom also
   they reckon among the attendants of Hercules. (I pass over the Argives,
   who worshipped Aphrodite, opener of graves.) The Argives and Spartans
   reverence Artemis Chelytis, or the cougher, from keluttein, which in
   their speech signifies to cough.

   Do you imagine from what source these details have been quoted? Only
   such as are furnished by yourselves are here adduced; and you do not
   seem to recognise your own writers, whom I call as witnesses against
   your unbelief. Poor wretches that ye are, who have filled with unholy
   jesting the whole compass of your life--a life in reality devoid of
   life!

   Is not Zeus the Baldhead worshipped in Argos; and another Zeus, the
   avenger, in Cyprus? Do not the Argives sacrifice to Aphrodite Peribaso
   (the protectress), [899] and the Athenians to Aphrodite Hetæra (the
   courtesan), and the Syracusans to Aphrodite Kallipygos, whom Nicander
   has somewhere called Kalliglutos (with beautiful rump). I pass over in
   silence just now Dionysus Choiropsales. [900] The Sicyonians reverence
   this deity, whom they have constituted the god of the muliebria--the
   patron of filthiness--and religiously honour as the author of
   licentiousness. Such, then, are their gods; such are they also who make
   mockery of the gods, or rather mock and insult themselves. How much
   better are the Egyptians, who in their towns and villages pay divine
   honours to the irrational creatures, than the Greeks, who worship such
   gods as these?

   For if they are beasts, they are not adulterous or libidinous, and seek
   pleasure in nothing that is contrary to nature. And of what sort these
   deities are, what need is there further to say, as they have been
   already sufficiently exposed? Furthermore, the Egyptians whom I have
   now mentioned are divided in their objects of worship. The Syenites
   worship the braize-fish; and the maiotes--this is another fish--is
   worshipped by those who inhabit Elephantine: the Oxyrinchites likewise
   worship a fish which takes its name from their country. Again, the
   Heraclitopolites worship the ichneumon, the inhabitants of Sais and of
   Thebes a sheep, the Leucopolites a wolf, the Cynopolites a dog, the
   Memphites Apis, the Mendesians a goat. And you, who are altogether
   better than the Egyptians (I shrink from saying worse), who never cease
   laughing every day of your lives at the Egyptians, what are some of
   you, too, with regard to brute beasts? For of your number the
   Thessalians pay divine homage to storks, in accordance with ancient
   custom; and the Thebans to weasels, for their assistance at the birth
   of Hercules. And again, are not the Thessalians reported to worship
   ants, since they have learned that Zeus in the likeness of an ant had
   intercourse with Eurymedusa, the daughter of Cletor, and begot
   Myrmidon? Polemo, too, relates that the people who inhabit the Troad
   worship the mice of the country, which they call Sminthoi, because they
   gnawed the strings of their enemies' bows; and from those mice Apollo
   has received his epithet of Sminthian. Heraclides, in his work,
   Regarding the Building of Temples in Acarnania, says that, at the place
   where the promontory of Actium is, and the temple of Apollo of Actium,
   they offer to the flies the sacrifice of an ox.

   Nor shall I forget the Samians: the Samians, as Euphorion says,
   reverence the sheep. Nor shall I forget the Syrians, who inhabit
   Phoenicia, of whom some revere doves, and others fishes, with as
   excessive veneration as the Eleans do Zeus. Well, then, since those you
   worship are not gods, it seems to me requisite to ascertain if those
   are really demons who are ranked, as you say, in this second order
   [next to the gods]. For if the lickerish and impure are demons,
   indigenous demons who have obtained sacred honours may be discovered in
   crowds throughout your cities: Menedemus among the Cythnians; among the
   Tenians, Callistagoras; among the Delians, Anius; among the Laconians,
   Astrabacus; at Phalerus, a hero affixed to the prow of ships is
   worshipped; and the Pythian priestess enjoined the Platæans to
   sacrifice to Androcrates and Democrates, and Cyclæus and Leuco while
   the Median war was at its height. Other demons in plenty may be brought
   to light by any one who can look about him a little.


   "For thrice ten thousand are there in the all-nourishing earth

   Of demons immortal, the guardians of articulate-speaking men." [901]

   Who these guardians are, do not grudge, O Boeotian, to tell. Is it not
   clear that they are those we have mentioned, and those of more renown,
   the great demons, Apollo, Artemis, Leto, Demeter, Core, Pluto,
   Hercules, and Zeus himself?

   But it is from running away that they guard us, O Ascræan, or perhaps
   it is from sinning, as forsooth they have never tried their hand at sin
   themselves! In that case verily the proverb may fitly be uttered:--


   "The father who took no admonition admonishes his son."

   If these are our guardians, it is not because they have any ardour of
   kindly feeling towards us, but intent on your ruin, after the manner of
   flatterers, they prey on your substance, enticed by the smoke. These
   demons themselves indeed confess their own gluttony, saying:--


   "For with drink-offerings due, and fat of lambs,

   My altar still hath at their hands been fed;

   Such honour hath to us been ever paid." [902]

   What other speech would they utter, if indeed the gods of the
   Egyptians, such as cats and weasels, should receive the faculty of
   speech, than that Homeric and poetic one which proclaims their liking
   for savoury odours and cookery? Such are your demons and gods, and
   demigods, if there are any so called, as there are demi-asses (mules);
   for you have no want of terms to make up compound names of impiety.

      Chapter III.--The Cruelty of the Sacrifices to the Gods.

   Well, now, let us say in addition, what inhuman demons, and hostile to
   the human race, your gods were, not only delighting in the insanity of
   men, but gloating over human slaughter,--now in the armed contests for
   superiority in the stadia, and now in the numberless contests for
   renown in the wars providing for themselves the means of pleasure, that
   they might be able abundantly to satiate themselves with the murder of
   human beings.

   And now, like plagues invading cities and nations, they demanded cruel
   oblations. Thus, Aristomenes the Messenian slew three hundred human
   beings in honour of Ithometan Zeus, thinking that hecatombs of such a
   number and quality would give good omens; among whom was Theopompos,
   king of the Lacedemonians, a noble victim.

   The Taurians, the people who inhabit the Tauric Chersonese, sacrifice
   to the Tauric Artemis forthwith whatever strangers they lay hands on on
   their coasts who have been cast adrift on the sea. These sacrifices
   Euripides represents in tragedies on the stage. Monimus relates, in his
   treatise on marvels, that at Pella, in Thessaly, a man of Achaia was
   slain in sacrifice to Peleus and Chiron. That the Lyctii, who are a
   Cretan race, slew men in sacrifice to Zeus, Anticlides shows in his
   Homeward Journeys; and that the Lesbians offered the like sacrifice to
   Dionysus, is said by Dosidas. The Phocæans also (for I will not pass
   over such as they are), Pythocles informs us in his third book, On
   Concord, offer a man as a burnt-sacrifice to the Taurian Artemis.

   Erechtheus of Attica and Marius the Roman [903] sacrificed their
   daughters,--the former to Pherephatta, as Demaratus mentions in his
   first book on Tragic Subjects; the latter to the evil-averting deities,
   as Dorotheus relates in his first book of Italian Affairs.
   Philanthropic, assuredly, the demons appear, from these examples; and
   how shall those who revere the demons not be correspondingly pious? The
   former are called by the fair name of saviours; and the latter ask for
   safety from those who plot against their safety, imagining that they
   sacrifice with good omens to them, and forget that they themselves are
   slaying men. For a murder does not become a sacrifice by being
   committed in a particular spot. You are not to call it a sacred
   sacrifice, if one slays a man either at the altar or on the highway to
   Artemis or Zeus, any more than if he slew him for anger or
   covetousness,--other demons very like the former; but a sacrifice of
   this kind is murder and human butchery. Then why is it, O men, wisest
   of all creatures, that you avoid wild beasts, and get out of the way of
   the savage animals, if you fall in with a bear or lion?


   ".  .  .  .  .  As when some traveller spies,

   Coiled in his path upon the mountain side,

   A deadly snake, back he recoils in haste,--

   His limbs all trembling, and his cheek all pale," [904]

   But though you perceive and understand demons to be deadly and wicked,
   plotters, haters of the human race, and destroyers, why do you not turn
   out of their way, or turn them out of yours? What truth can the wicked
   tell, or what good can they do any one?

   I can then readily demonstrate that man is better than these gods of
   yours, who are but demons; and can show, for instance, that Cyrus and
   Solon were superior to oracular Apollo. Your Phoebus was a lover of
   gifts, but not a lover of men. He betrayed his friend Croesus, and
   forgetting the reward he had got (so careful was he of his fame), led
   him across the Halys to the stake. The demons love men in such a way as
   to bring them to the fire [unquenchable].

   But O man, who lovest the human race better, and art truer than Apollo,
   pity him that is bound on the pyre. Do thou, O Solon, declare truth;
   and thou, O Cyrus, command the fire to be extinguished. Be wise, then,
   at last, O Croesus, taught by suffering. He whom you worship is an
   ingrate; he accepts your reward, and after taking the gold plays false.
   "Look again to the end, O Solon." It is not the demon, but the man that
   tells you this. It is not ambiguous oracles that Solon utters. You
   shall easily take him up. Nothing but true, O Barbarian, shall you find
   by proof this oracle to be, when you are placed on the pyre. Whence I
   cannot help wondering, by what plausible reasons those who first went
   astray were impelled to preach superstition to men, when they exhorted
   them to worship wicked demons, whether it was Phoroneus or Merops, or
   whoever else that raised temples and altars to them; and besides, as is
   fabled, were the first to offer sacrifices to them. But,
   unquestionably, in succeeding ages men invented for themselves gods to
   worship. It is beyond doubt that this Eros, who is said to be among the
   oldest of the gods, was worshipped by no one till Charmus took a little
   boy and raised an altar to him in Academia,--a thing more seemly [905]
   than the lust he had gratified; and the lewdness of vice men called by
   the name of Eros, deifying thus unbridled lust. The Athenians, again,
   knew not who Pan was till Philippides told them.

   Superstition, then, as was to be expected, having taken its rise thus,
   became the fountain of insensate wickedness; and not being subsequently
   checked, but having gone on augmenting and rushing along in full flood,
   it became the originator of many demons, and was displayed in
   sacrificing hecatombs, appointing solemn assemblies, setting up images,
   and building temples, which were in reality tombs: for I will not pass
   these over in silence, but make a thorough exposure of them, though
   called by the august name of temples; that is, the tombs which got the
   name of temples. But do ye now at length quite give up your
   superstition, feeling ashamed to regard sepulchres with religious
   veneration. In the temple of Athene in Larissa, on the Acropolis, is
   the grave of Acrisius; and at Athens, on the Acropolis, is that of
   Cecrops, as Antiochus says in the ninth book of his Histories. What of
   Erichthonius? was he not buried in the temple of Polias? And Immarus,
   the son of Eumolpus and Daira, were they not buried in the precincts of
   the Elusinium, which is under the Acropolis; and the daughters of
   Celeus, were they not interred in Eleusis? Why should I enumerate to
   you the wives of the Hyperboreans? They were called Hyperoche and
   Laodice; they were buried in the Artemisium in Delos, which is in the
   temple of the Delian Apollo. Leandrius says that Clearchus was buried
   in Miletus, in the Didymæum. Following the Myndian Zeno, it were
   unsuitable in this connection to pass over the sepulchre of
   Leucophryne, who was buried in the temple of Artemis in Magnesia; or
   the altar of Apollo in Telmessus, which is reported to be the tomb of
   Telmisseus the seer. Further, Ptolemy the son of Agesarchus, in his
   first book about Philopator, says that Cinyras and the descendants of
   Cinyras were interred in the temple of Aphrodite in Paphos. But all
   time would not be sufficient for me, were I to go over the tombs which
   are held sacred by you. And if no shame for these audacious impieties
   steals over you, it comes to this, that you are completely dead,
   putting, as really you do, your trust in the dead.


   "Poor wretches, what misery is this you suffer?

   Your heads are enveloped in the darkness of night." [906]

      Chapter IV.--The Absurdity and Shamefulness of the Images by Which the
      Gods are Worshipped.

   If, in addition, I take and set before you for inspection these very
   images, you will, as you go over them, find how truly silly is the
   custom in which you have been reared, of worshipping the senseless
   works of men's hands.

   Anciently, then, the Scythians worshipped their sabres, the Arabs
   stones, the Persians rivers. And some, belonging to other races still
   more ancient, set up blocks of wood in conspicuous situations, and
   erected pillars of stone, which were called Xoana, from the carving of
   the material of which they were made. The image of Artemis in Icarus
   was doubtless unwrought wood, and that of the Cithæronian Here was a
   felled tree-trunk; and that of the Samian Here, as Æthlius says, was at
   first a plank, and was afterwards during the government of Proclus
   carved into human shape. And when the Xoana began to be made in the
   likeness of men, they got the name of Brete,--a term derived from
   Brotos (man). In Rome, the historian Varro says that in ancient times
   the Xoaron of Mars--the idol by which he was worshipped--was a spear,
   artists not having yet applied themselves to this specious pernicious
   art; but when art flourished, error increased. That of stones and
   stocks--and, to speak briefly, of dead matter--you have made images of
   human form, by which you have produced a counterfeit of piety, and
   slandered the truth, is now as clear as can be; but such proof as the
   point may demand must not be declined.

   That the statue of Zeus at Olympia, and that of Polias at Athens, were
   executed of gold and ivory by Phidias, is known by everybody; and that
   the image of Here in Samos was formed by the chisel of Euclides,
   Olympichus relates in his Samiaca. Do not, then, entertain any doubt,
   that of the gods called at Athens venerable, Scopas made two of the
   stone called Lychnis, and Calos the one which they are reported to have
   had placed between them, as Polemon shows in the fourth of his books
   addressed to Timæus. Nor need you doubt respecting the images of Zeus
   and Apollo at Patara, in Lycia, which Phidias executed, as well as the
   lions that recline with them; and if, as some say, they were the work
   of Bryxis, I do not dispute,--you have in him another maker of images.
   Whichever of these you like, write down. Furthermore, the statues nine
   cubits in height of Poseidon and Amphitrite, worshipped in Tenos, are
   the work of Telesius the Athenian, as we are told by Philochorus.
   Demetrius, in the second book of his Argolics, writes of the image of
   Here in Tiryns, both that the material was pear-tree and the artist was
   Argus.

   Many, perhaps, may be surprised to learn that the Palladium which is
   called the Diopetes--that is, fallen from heaven--which Diomede and
   Ulysses are related to have carried off from Troy and deposited at
   Demophoon, was made of the bones of Pelops, as the Olympian Jove of
   other bones--those of the Indian wild beast. I adduce as my authority
   Dionysius, who relates this in the fifth part of his Cycle. And
   Apellas, in the Delphics, says that there were two Palladia, and that
   both were fashioned by men. But that one may suppose that I have passed
   over them through ignorance, I shall add that the image of Dionysus
   Morychus at Athens was made of the stones called Phellata, and was the
   work of Simon the son of Eupalamus, as Polemo says in a letter. There
   were also two other sculptors of Crete, as I think: they were called
   Scyles and Dipoenus; and these executed the statues of the Dioscuri in
   Argos, and the image of Hercules in Tiryns, and the effigy of the
   Munychian Artemis in Sicyon. Why should I linger over these, when I can
   point out to you the great deity himself, and show you who he
   was,--whom indeed, conspicuously above all, we hear to have been
   considered worthy of veneration? Him they have dared to speak of as
   made without hands--I mean the Egyptian Serapis. For some relate that
   he was sent as a present by the people of Sinope to Ptolemy
   Philadelphus, king of the Egyptians, who won their favour by sending
   them corn from Egypt when they were perishing with famine; and that
   this idol was an image of Pluto; and Ptolemy, having received the
   statue, placed it on the promontory which is now called Racotis; where
   the temple of Serapis was held in honour, and the sacred enclosure
   borders on the spot; and that Blistichis the courtesan having died in
   Canopus, Ptolemy had her conveyed there, and buried beneath the
   forementioned shrine.

   Others say that the Serapis was a Pontic idol, and was transported with
   solemn pomp to Alexandria. Isidore alone says that it was brought from
   the Seleucians, near Antioch, who also had been visited with a dearth
   of corn, and had been fed by Ptolemy. But Athenodorns the son of
   Sandon, while wishing to make out the Serapis to be ancient, has
   somehow slipped into the mistake of proving it to be an image fashioned
   by human hands. He says that Sesostris the Egyptian king, having
   subjugated the most of the Hellenic races, on his return to Egypt
   brought a number of craftsmen with him. Accordingly he ordered a statue
   of Osiris, his ancestor, to be executed in sumptuous style; and the
   work was done by the artist Bryaxis, not the Athenian, but another of
   the same name, who employed in its execution a mixture of various
   materials. For he had filings of gold, and silver, and lead, and in
   addition, tin; and of Egyptian stones not one was wanting, and there
   were fragments of sapphire, and hematite, and emerald, and topaz.
   Having ground down and mixed together all these ingredients, he gave to
   the composition a blue colour, whence the darkish hue of the image; and
   having mixed the whole with the colouring matter that was left over
   from the funeral of Osiris and Apis, moulded the Serapis, the name of
   which points to its connection with sepulture and its construction from
   funeral materials, compounded as it is of Osiris and Apis, which
   together make Osirapis.

   Another new deity was added to the number with great religious pomp in
   Egypt, and was near being so in Greece by the king of the Romans, who
   deified Antinous, whom he loved as Zeus loved Ganymede, and whose
   beauty was of a very rare order: for lust is not easily restrained,
   destitute as it is of fear; and men now observe the sacred nights of
   Antinous, the shameful character of which the lover who spent them with
   him knew well. Why reckon him among the gods, who is honoured on
   account of uncleanness? And why do you command him to be lamented as a
   son? And why should you enlarge on his beauty? Beauty blighted by vice
   is loathsome. Do not play the tyrant, O man, over beauty, nor offer
   foul insult to youth in its bloom. Keep beauty pure, that it may be
   truly fair. Be king over beauty, not its tyrant. Remain free, and then
   I shall acknowledge thy beauty, because thou hast kept its image pure:
   then will I worship that true beauty which is the archetype of all who
   are beautiful. Now the grave of the debauched boy is the temple and
   town of Antinous. For just as temples are held in reverence, so also
   are sepulchres, and pyramids, and mausoleums, and labyrinths, which are
   temples of the dead, as the others are sepulchres of the gods. As
   teacher on this point, I shall produce to you the Sibyl prophetess:--


   "Not the oracular lie of Phoebus,

   Whom silly men called God, and falsely termed Prophet;

   But the oracles of the great God, who was not made by men's hands,

   Like dumb idols of Sculptured stone." [907]

   She also predicts the ruin of the temple, foretelling that that of the
   Ephesian Artemis would be engulphed by earthquakes and rents in the
   ground, as follows:--


   "Prostrate on the ground Ephesus shall wail, weeping by the shore,

   And seeking a temple that has no longer an inhabitant."

   She says also that the temple of Isis and Serapis would be demolished
   and burned:--


   "Isis, thrice-wretched goddess, thou shalt linger by the streams of the
   Nile;

   Solitary, frenzied, silent, on the sands of Acheron."

   Then she proceeds:--


   "And thou, Serapis, covered with a heap of white stones,

   Shalt lie a huge ruin in thrice-wretched Egypt."

   But if you attend not to the prophetess, hear at least your own
   philosopher, the Ephesian Heraclitus, upbraiding images with their
   senselessness: "And to these images they pray, with the same result as
   if one were to talk to the walls of his house." For are they not to be
   wondered at who worship stones, and place them before the doors, as if
   capable of activity? They worship Hermes as a god, and place Aguieus as
   a doorkeeper. For if people upbraid them with being devoid of
   sensation, why worship them as gods? And if they are thought to be
   endowed with sensation, why place them before the door? The Romans, who
   ascribed their greatest successes to Fortune, and regarded her as a
   very great deity, took her statue to the privy, and erected it there,
   assigning to the goddess as a fitting temple--the necessary. But
   senseless wood and stone, and rich gold, care not a whit for either
   savoury odour, or blood, or smoke, by which, being at once honoured and
   fumigated, they are blackened; no more do they for honour or insult.
   And these images are more worthless than any animal. I am at a loss to
   conceive how objects devoid of sense were deified, and feel compelled
   to pity as miserable wretches those that wander in the mazes of this
   folly: for if some living creatures have not all the senses, as worms
   and caterpillars, and such as even from the first appear imperfect, as
   moles and the shrew-mouse, which Nicander says is blind and uncouth;
   yet are they superior to those utterly senseless idols and images. For
   they have some one sense,--say, for example, hearing, or touching, or
   something analogous to smell or taste; while images do not possess even
   one sense. There are many creatures that have neither sight, nor
   hearing, nor speech, such as the genus of oysters, which yet live and
   grow, and are affected by the changes of the moon. But images, being
   motionless, inert, and senseless, are bound, nailed, glued,--are
   melted, filed, sawed, polished, carved. The senseless earth is
   dishonoured by the makers of images, who change it by their art from
   its proper nature, and induce men to worship it; and the makers of gods
   worship not gods and demons, but in my view earth and art, which go to
   make up images. For, in sooth, the image is only dead matter shaped by
   the craftsman's hand. But we have no sensible image of sensible matter,
   but an image that is perceived by the mind alone,--God, who alone is
   truly God. [908]

   And again, when involved in calamities, the superstitious worshippers
   of stones, though they have learned by the event that senseless matter
   is not to be worshipped, yet, yielding to the pressure of misfortune,
   become the victims of their superstition; and though despising the
   images, yet not wishing to appear wholly to neglect them, are found
   fault with by those gods by whose names the images are called.

   For Dionysius the tyrant, the younger, having stripped off the golden
   mantle from the statue of Jupiter in Sicily, ordered him to be clothed
   in a woollen one, remarking facetiously that the latter was better than
   the golden one, being lighter in summer and warmer in winter. And
   Antiochus of Cyzicus, being in difficulties for money, ordered the
   golden statue of Zeus, fifteen cubits in height, to be melted; and one
   like it, of less valuable material, plated with gold, to be erected in
   place of it. And the swallows and most birds fly to these statues, and
   void their excrement on them, paying no respect either to Olympian
   Zeus, or Epidaurian Asclepius, or even to Athene Polias, or the
   Egyptian Serapis; but not even from them have you learned the
   senselessness of images. [909] But it has happened that miscreants or
   enemies have assailed and set fire to temples, and plundered them of
   their votive gifts, and melted even the images themselves, from base
   greed of gain. And if a Cambyses or a Darius, or any other madman, has
   made such attempts, and if one has killed the Egyptian Apis, I laugh at
   him killing their god, while pained at the outrage being perpetrated
   for the sake of gain. I will therefore willingly forget such villany,
   looking on acts like these more as deeds of covetousness, than as a
   proof of the impotence of idols. But fire and earthquakes are shrewd
   enough not to feel shy or frightened at either demons or idols, any
   more than at pebbles heaped by the waves on the shore.

   I know fire to be capable of exposing and curing superstition. If thou
   art willing to abandon this folly, the element of fire shall light thy
   way. This same fire burned the temple in Argos, with Chrysis the
   priestess; and that of Artemis in Ephesus the second time after the
   Amazons. And the Capitol in Rome was often wrapped in flames; nor did
   the fire spare the temple of Serapis, in the city of the Alexandrians.
   At Athens it demolished the temple of the Eleutherian Dionysus; and as
   to the temple of Apollo at Delphi, first a storm assailed it, and then
   the discerning fire utterly destroyed it. This is told as the preface
   of what the fire promises. And the makers of images, do they not shame
   those of you who are wise into despising matter? The Athenian Phidias
   inscribed on the finger of the Olympian Jove, Pantarkes [910] is
   beautiful. It was not Zeus that was beautiful in his eyes, but the man
   he loved. And Praxiteles, as Posidippus relates in his book about
   Cnidus, when he fashioned the statue of Aphrodite of Cnidus, made it
   like the form of Cratine, of whom he was enamoured, that the miserable
   people might have the paramour of Praxiteles to worship. And when
   Phryne the courtesan, the Thespian, was in her bloom, all the painters
   made their pictures of Aphrodite copies of the beauty of Phryne; as,
   again, the sculptors at Athens made their Mercuries like Alcibiades. It
   remains for you to judge whether you ought to worship courtesans.
   Moved, as I believe, by such facts, and despising such fables, the
   ancient kings unblushingly proclaimed themselves gods, as this involved
   no danger from men, and thus taught that on account of their glory they
   were made immortal. Ceux, the son of Eolus, was styled Zeus by his wife
   Alcyone; Alcyone, again, being by her husband styled Hera. Ptolemy the
   Fourth was called Dionysus; and Mithridates of Pontus was also called
   Dionysus; and Alexander wished to be considered the son of Ammon, and
   to have his statue made horned by the sculptors--eager to disgrace the
   beauty of the human form by the addition of a horn. And not kings only,
   but private persons dignified themselves with the names of deities, as
   Menecrates the physician, who took the name of Zeus. What need is there
   for me to instance Alexarchus? He, having been by profession a
   grammarian, assumed the character of the sun-god, as Aristus of Salamis
   relates. And why mention Nicagorus? He was a native of Zela [in
   Pontus], and lived in the days of Alexander. Nicagorus was styled
   Hermes, and used the dress of Hermes, as he himself testifies. And
   whilst whole nations, and cities with all their inhabitants, sinking
   into self-flattery, treat the myths about the gods with contempt, at
   the same time men themselves, assuming the air of equality with the
   gods, and being puffed up with vainglory, vote themselves extravagant
   honours. There is the case of the Macedonian Philip of Pella, the son
   of Amyntor, to whom they decreed divine worship in Cynosargus, although
   his collar-bone was broken, and he had a lame leg, and had one of his
   eyes knocked out. And again that of Demetrius, who was raised to the
   rank of the gods; and where he alighted from his horse on his entrance
   into Athens is the temple of Demetrius the Alighter; and altars were
   raised to him everywhere, and nuptials with Athene assigned to him by
   the Athenians. But he disdained the goddess, as he could not marry the
   statue; and taking the courtesan Lamia, he ascended the Acropolis, and
   lay with her on the couch of Athene, showing to the old virgin the
   postures of the young courtesan.

   There is no cause for indignation, then, at Hippo, who immortalized his
   own death. For this Hippo ordered the following elegy to be inscribed
   on his tomb:--


   "This is the sepulchre of Hippo, whom Destiny

   Made, through death, equal to the immortal gods."

   Well done, Hippo! thou showest to us the delusion of men. If they did
   not believe thee speaking, now that thou art dead, let them become thy
   disciples. This is the oracle of Hippo; let us consider it. The objects
   of your worship were once men, and in process of time died; and fable
   and time have raised them to honour. For somehow, what is present is
   wont to be despised through familiarity; but what is past, being
   separated through the obscurity of time from the temporary censure that
   attached to it, is invested with honour by fiction, so that the present
   is viewed with distrust, the past with admiration. Exactly in this way
   is it, then, that the dead men of antiquity, being reverenced through
   the long prevalence of delusion respecting them, are regarded as gods
   by posterity. As grounds of your belief in these, there are your
   mysteries, your solemn assemblies, bonds and wounds, and weeping
   deities.


   "Woe, woe! that fate decrees my best-belov'd,

   Sarpedon, by Patroclus' hand to fall." [911]

   The will of Zeus was overruled; and Zeus being worsted, laments for
   Sarpedon. With reason, therefore, have you yourselves called them
   shades and demons, since Homer, paying Athene and the other divinities
   sinister honour, has styled them demons:--


   "She her heavenward course pursued

   To join the immortals in the abode of Jove." [912]

   How, then, can shades and demons be still reckoned gods, being in
   reality unclean and impure spirits, acknowledged by all to be of an
   earthly and watery nature, sinking downwards by their own weight, and
   flitting about graves and tombs, about which they appear dimly, being
   but shadowy phantasms? Such things are your gods--shades and shadows;
   and to these add those maimed, wrinkled, squinting divinities the Litæ,
   daughters of Thersites rather than of Zeus. So that Bion--wittily, as I
   think--says, How in reason could men pray Zeus for a beautiful
   progeny,--a thing he could not obtain for himself?

   The incorruptible being, as far as in you lies, you sink in the earth;
   and that pure and holy essence you have buried in the grave, robbing
   the divine of its true nature.

   Why, I pray you, have you assigned the prerogatives of God to what are
   no gods? Why, let me ask, have you forsaken heaven to pay divine honour
   to earth? What else is gold, or silver, or steel, or iron, or brass, or
   ivory, or precious stones? Are they not earth, and of the earth?

   Are not all these things which you look on the progeny of one
   mother--the earth?

   Why, then, foolish and silly men (for I will repeat it), have you,
   defaming the supercelestial region, dragged religion to the ground, by
   fashioning to yourselves gods of earth, and by going after those
   created objects, instead of the uncreated Deity, have sunk into deepest
   darkness?

   The Parian stone is beautiful, but it is not yet Poseidon. The ivory is
   beautiful, but it is not yet the Olympian Zeus. Matter always needs art
   to fashion it, but the deity needs nothing. Art has come forward to do
   its work, and the matter is clothed with its shape; and while the
   preciousness of the material makes it capable of being turned to
   profitable account, it is only on account of its form that it comes to
   be deemed worthy of veneration. Thy image, if considered as to its
   origin, is gold, it is wood, it is stone, it is earth, which has
   received shape from the artist's hand. But I have been in the habit of
   walking on the earth, not of worshipping it. For I hold it wrong to
   entrust my spirit's hopes to things destitute of the breath of life. We
   must therefore approach as close as possible to the images. How
   peculiarly inherent deceit is in them, is manifest from their very
   look. For the forms of the images are plainly stamped with the
   characteristic nature of demons. If one go round and inspect the
   pictures and images, he will at a glance recognise your gods from their
   shameful forms: Dionysus from his robe; Hephæstus from his art; Demeter
   from her calamity; Ino from her head-dress; Poseidon from his trident;
   Zeus from the swan; the pyre indicates Heracles; and if one sees a
   statue of a naked woman without an inscription, he understands it to be
   the golden Aphrodite. Thus that Cyprian Pygmalion became enamoured of
   an image of ivory: the image was Aphrodite, and it was nude. The
   Cyprian is made a conquest of by the mere shape, and embraces the
   image. This is related by Philostephanus. A different Aphrodite in
   Cnidus was of stone, and beautiful. Another person became enamoured of
   it, and shamefully embraced the stone. Posidippus relates this. The
   former of these authors, in his book on Cyprus, and the latter in his
   book on Cnidus. So powerful is art to delude, by seducing amorous men
   into the pit. Art is powerful, but it cannot deceive reason, nor those
   who live agreeably to reason. The doves on the picture were represented
   so to the life by the painter's art, that the pigeons flew to them; and
   horses have neighed to well-executed pictures of mares. They say that a
   girl became enamoured of an image, and a comely youth of the statue at
   Cnidus. But it was the eyes of the spectators that were deceived by
   art; for no one in his senses ever would have embraced a goddess, or
   entombed himself with a lifeless paramour, or become enamoured of a
   demon and a stone. But it is with a different kind of spell that art
   deludes you, if it leads you not to the indulgence of amorous
   affections: it leads you to pay religious honour and worship to images
   and pictures.

   The picture is like. Well and good! Let art receive its meed of praise,
   but let it not deceive man by passing itself off for truth. The horse
   stands quiet; the dove flutters not, its wing is motionless. But the
   cow of Dædalus, made of wood, allured the savage bull; and art having
   deceived him, compelled him to meet a woman full of licentious passion.
   Such frenzy have mischief-working arts created in the minds of the
   insensate. On the other hand, apes are admired by those who feed and
   care for them, because nothing in the shape of images and girls'
   ornaments of wax or clay deceives them. You then will show yourselves
   inferior to apes by cleaving to stone, and wood, and gold, and ivory
   images, and to pictures. Your makers of such mischievous toys--the
   sculptors and makers of images, the painters and workers in metal, and
   the poets--have introduced a motley crowd of divinities: in the fields,
   Satyrs and Pans; in the woods, Nymphs, and Oreads, and Hamadryads; and
   besides, in the waters, the rivers, and fountains, the Naiads; and in
   the sea the Nereids. And now the Magi boast that the demons are the
   ministers of their impiety, reckoning them among the number of their
   domestics, and by their charms compelling them to be their slaves.
   Besides, the nuptials of the deities, their begetting and bringing
   forth of children that are recounted, their adulteries celebrated in
   song, their carousals represented in comedy, and bursts of laughter
   over their cups, which your authors introduce, urge me to cry out,
   though I would fain be silent. Oh the godlessness! You have turned
   heaven into a stage; the Divine has become a drama; and what is sacred
   you have acted in comedies under the masks of demons, travestying true
   religion by your demon-worship [superstition].


   "But he, striking the lyre, began to sing beautifully." [913]

   Sing to us, Homer, that beautiful song


   "About the amours of Ares and Venus with the beautiful crown:

   How first they slept together in the palace of Hephæstus

   Secretly; and he gave many gifts, and dishonoured the bed and chamber
   of king Hephæstus."

   Stop, O Homer, the song! It is not beautiful; it teaches adultery, and
   we are prohibited from polluting our ears with hearing about adultery
   for we are they who bear about with us, in this living and moving image
   of our human nature, the likeness of God,--a likeness which dwells with
   us, takes counsel with us, associates with us, is a guest with us,
   feels with us, feels for us. We have become a consecrated offering to
   God for Christ's sake: we are the chosen generation, the royal
   priesthood, the holy nation, the peculiar people, who once were not a
   people, but are now the people of God; who, according to John, are not
   of those who are beneath, but have learned all from Him who came from
   above; who have come to understand the dispensation of God; who have
   learned to walk in newness of life. But these are not the sentiments of
   the many; but, casting off shame and fear, they depict in their houses
   the unnatural passions of the demons. Accordingly, wedded to impurity,
   they adorn their bed-chambers with painted tablets [914] hung up in
   them, regarding licentiousness as religion; and lying in bed, in the
   midst of their embraces, they look on that Aphrodite locked in the
   embrace of her paramour. And in the hoops of their rings they cut a
   representation of the amorous bird that fluttered round Leda,--having a
   strong predilection for representations of effeminacy,--and use a seal
   stamped with an impression of the licentiousness of Zeus. Such are
   examples of your voluptuousness, such are the theologies of vice, such
   are the instructions of your gods, who commit fornication along with
   you; for what one wishes, that he thinks, according to the Athenian
   orator. And of what kind, on the other hand, are your other images?
   Diminutive Pans, and naked girls, and drunken Satyrs, and phallic
   tokens, painted naked in pictures disgraceful for filthiness. And more
   than this: you are not ashamed in the eyes of all to look at
   representations of all forms of licentiousness which are portrayed in
   public places, but set them up and guard them with scrupulous care,
   consecrating these pillars of shamelessness at home, as if, forsooth,
   they were the images of your gods, depicting on them equally the
   postures of Philænis and the labours of Heracles. Not only the use of
   these, but the sight of them, and the very hearing of them, we denounce
   as deserving the doom of oblivion. Your ears are debauched, your eyes
   commit fornication, your looks commit adultery before you embrace. O ye
   that have done violence to man, and have devoted to shame what is
   divine in this handiwork of God, you disbelieve everything that you may
   indulge your passions, and that ye may believe in idols, because you
   have a craving after their licentiousness, but disbelieve God, because
   you cannot bear a life of self-restraint. You have hated what was
   better, and valued what was worse, having been spectators indeed of
   virtue, but actors of vice. Happy, therefore, so to say, alone are all
   those with one accord,--


   "Who shall refuse to look on any temples

   And altars, worthless seats of dumb stones,

   And idols of stone, and images made by hands,

   Stained with the life's-blood, and with sacrifices

   Of quadrupeds, and bipeds, and fowls, and butcheries of wild beasts."
   [915]

   For we are expressly prohibited from exercising a deceptive art: "For
   thou shalt not make," says the prophet, "the likeness of anything which
   is in heaven above or in the earth beneath." [916]

   For can we possibly any longer suppose the Demeter, and the Core, and
   the mystic Iacchus of Praxiteles, to be gods, and not rather regard the
   art of Leucippus, or the hands of Apelles, which clothed the material
   with the form of the divine glory, as having a better title to the
   honour? But while you bestow the greatest pains that the image may be
   fashioned with the most exquisite beauty possible, you exercise no care
   to guard against your becoming like images for stupidity. Accordingly,
   with the utmost clearness and brevity, the prophetic word condemns this
   practice: "For all the gods of the nations are the images of demons;
   but God made the heavens, and what is in heaven." [917] Some, however,
   who have fallen into error, I know not how, worship God's work instead
   of God Himself,--the sun and the moon, and the rest of the starry
   choir,--absurdly imagining these, which are but instruments for
   measuring time, to be gods; "for by His word they were established, and
   all their host by the breath of His mouth." [918]

   Human art, moreover, produces houses, and ships, and cities, and
   pictures. But how shall I tell what God makes? Behold the whole
   universe; it is His work: and the heaven, and the sun, and angels, and
   men, are the works of His fingers. [919] How great is the power of God!
   His bare volition was the creation of the universe. For God alone made
   it, because He alone is truly God. By the bare exercise of volition He
   creates; His mere willing was followed by the springing into being of
   what He willed. Consequently the choir of philosophers are in error,
   who indeed most nobly confess that man was made for the contemplation
   of the heavens, but who worship the objects that appear in the heavens
   and are apprehended by sight. For if the heavenly bodies are not the
   works of men, they were certainly created for man. Let none of you
   worship the sun, but set his desires on the Maker of the sun; nor deify
   the universe, but seek after the Creator of the universe. The only
   refuge, then, which remains for him who would reach the portals of
   salvation is divine wisdom. From this, as from a sacred asylum, the man
   who presses after salvation, can be dragged by no demon.

      Chapter V.--The Opinions of the Philosophers Respecting God.

   Let us then run over, if you choose, the opinions of the philosophers,
   to which they give boastful utterance, respecting the gods; that we may
   discover philosophy itself, through its conceit making an idol of
   matter; although we are able to show, as we proceed, that even while
   deifying certain demons, it has a dream of the truth. The elements were
   designated as the first principles of all things by some of them: by
   Thales of Miletus, who celebrated water, and Anaximenes, also of
   Miletus, who celebrated air as the first principle of all things, and
   was followed afterwards by Diogenes of Apollonia. Parmenides of Elia
   introduced fire and earth as gods; one of which, namely fire, Hippasus
   of Metapontum and Heraclitus of Ephesus supposed a divinity. Empedocles
   of Agrigentum fell in with a multitude, and, in addition to those four
   elements, enumerates disagreement and agreement. Atheists surely these
   are to be reckoned, who through an unwise wisdom worshipped matter, who
   did not indeed pay religious honour to stocks and stones, but deified
   earth, the mother of these,--who did not make an image of Poseidon, but
   revered water itself. For what else, according to the original
   signification, is Poseidon, but a moist substance? the name being
   derived from posis (drink); as, beyond doubt, the warlike Ares is so
   called, from arsis (rising up) and anoeresis (destroying). For this
   reason mainly, I think, many fix a sword into the ground, and sacrifice
   to it as to Ares. The Scythians have a practice of this nature, as
   Eudoxus tells us in the second book of his Travels. The Sauromatæ, too,
   a tribe of the Scythians, worship a sabre, as Ikesius says in his work
   on Mysteries.

   This was also the case with Heraclitus and his followers, who
   worshipped fire as the first cause; for this fire others named
   Hephæstus. The Persian Magi, too, and many of the inhabitants of Asia,
   worshipped fire; and besides them, the Macedonians, as Diogenes relates
   in the first book of his Persica. Why specify the Sauromatæ, who are
   said by Nymphodorus, in his Barbaric Customs, to pay sacred honours to
   fire? or the Persians, or the Medes, or the Magi? These, Dino tells us,
   sacrifice beneath the open sky, regarding fire and water as the only
   images of the gods.

   Nor have I failed to reveal their ignorance; for, however much they
   think to keep clear of error in one form, they slide into it in
   another.

   They have not supposed stocks and stones to be images of the gods, like
   the Greeks; nor ibises and ichneumons, like the Egyptians; but fire and
   water, as philosophers. Berosus, in the third book of his Chaldaics,
   shows that it was after many successive periods of years that men
   worshipped images of human shape, this practice being introduced by
   Artaxerxes, the son of Darius, and father of Ochus, who first set up
   the image of Aphrodite Anaitis at Babylon and Susa; and Ecbatana set
   the example of worshipping it to the Persians; the Bactrians, to
   Damascus and Sardis.

   Let the philosophers, then, own as their teachers the Persians, or the
   Sauromatæ, or the Magi, from whom they have learned the impious
   doctrine of regarding as divine certain first principles, being
   ignorant of the great First Cause, the Maker of all things, and Creator
   of those very first principles, the unbeginning God, but reverencing
   "these weak and beggarly elements," [920] as the apostle says, which
   were made for the service of man. And of the rest of the philosophers
   who, passing over the elements, have eagerly sought after something
   higher and nobler, some have discanted on the Infinite, of whom were
   Anaximander of Miletus, Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ, and the Athenian
   Archelaus, both of whom set Mind (nous) above Infinity; while the
   Milesian Leucippus and the Chian Metrodorus apparently inculcated two
   first principles--fulness and vacuity. Democritus of Abdera, while
   accepting these two, added to them images ei dola; while Alcmæon of
   Crotona supposed the stars to be gods, and endowed with life (I will
   not keep silence as to their effrontery). Xenocrates of Chalcedon
   indicates that the planets are seven gods, and that the universe,
   composed of all these, is an eighth. Nor will I pass over those of the
   Porch, who say that the Divinity pervades all matter, even the vilest,
   and thus clumsily disgrace philosophy. Nor do I think will it be taken
   ill, having reached this point, to advert to the Peripatetics. The
   father of this sect, not knowing the Father of all things, thinks that
   He who is called the Highest is the soul of the universe; that is, he
   supposes the soul of the world to be God, and so is pierced by his own
   sword. For by first limiting the sphere of Providence to the orbit of
   the moon, and then by supposing the universe to be God, he confutes
   himself, inasmuch as he teaches that that which is without God is God.
   And that Eresian Theophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle, conjectures at
   one time heaven, and at another spirit, to be God. Epicurus alone I
   shall gladly forget, who carries impiety to its full length, and thinks
   that God takes no charge of the world. What, moreover, of Heraclides of
   Pontus? He is dragged everywhere to the images--the eidola--of
   Democritus.

      Chapter VI.--By Divine Inspiration Philosophers Sometimes Hit on the
      Truth.

   A great crowd of this description rushes on my mind, introducing, as it
   were, a terrifying apparition of strange demons, speaking of fabulous
   and monstrous shapes, in old wives' talk. Far from enjoining men to
   listen to such tales are we, who avoid the practice of soothing our
   crying children, as the saying is, by telling them fabulous stories,
   being afraid of fostering in their minds the impiety professed by those
   who, though wise in their own conceit, have no more knowledge of the
   truth than infants. For why (in the name of truth!) do you make those
   who believe you subject to ruin and corruption, dire and irretrievable?
   Why, I beseech you, fill up life with idolatrous images, by feigning
   the winds, or the air, or fire, or earth, or stones, or stocks, or
   steel, or this universe, to be gods; and, prating loftily of the
   heavenly bodies in this much vaunted science of astrology, not
   astronomy, to those men who have truly wandered, talk of the wandering
   stars as gods? It is the Lord of the spirits, the Lord of the fire, the
   Maker of the universe, Him who lighted up the sun, that I long for. I
   seek after God, not the works of God. Whom shall I take as a helper in
   my inquiry? We do not, if you have no objection, wholly disown Plato.
   How, then, is God to be searched out, O Plato? "For both to find the
   Father and Maker of this universe is a work of difficulty; and having
   found Him, to declare Him fully, is impossible." [921]

   Why so? by Himself, I beseech you! For He can by no means be expressed.
   Well done, Plato! Thou hast touched on the truth. But do not flag.
   Undertake with me the inquiry respecting the Good. For into all men
   whatever, especially those who are occupied with intellectual pursuits,
   a certain divine effluence has been instilled; wherefore, though
   reluctantly, they confess that God is one, indestructible, unbegotten,
   and that somewhere above in the tracts of heaven, in His own peculiar
   appropriate eminence, whence He surveys all things, He has an existence
   true and eternal.


   "Tell me what I am to conceive God to be,

   Who sees all things, and is Himself unseen,"

   Euripides says. Accordingly, Menander seems to me to have fallen into
   error when he said:--


   "O sun! for thou, first of gods, ought to be worshipped,

   By whom it is that we are able to see the other gods."

   For the sun never could show me the true God; but that healthful Word,
   that is the Sun of the soul, by whom alone, when He arises in the
   depths of the soul, the eye of the soul itself is irradiated. Whence
   accordingly, Democritus, not without reason, says, "that a few of the
   men of intellect, raising their hands upwards to what we Greeks now
   call the air (aer), called the whole expanse Zeus, or God: He, too,
   knows all things, gives and takes away, and He is King of all."

   Of the same sentiments is Plato, who somewhere alludes to God thus:
   "Around the King of all are all things, and He is the cause of all good
   things." Who, then, is the King of all? God, who is the measure of the
   truth of all existence. As, then, the things that are to be measured
   are contained in the measure, so also the knowledge of God measures and
   comprehends truth. And the truly holy Moses says: "There shall not be
   in thy bag a balance and a balance, great or small, but a true and just
   balance shall be to thee," [922] deeming the balance and measure and
   number of the whole to be God. For the unjust and unrighteous idols are
   hid at home in the bag, and, so to speak, in the polluted soul. But the
   only just measure is the only true God, always just, continuing the
   self-same; who measures all things, and weighs them by righteousness as
   in a balance, grasping and sustaining universal nature in equilibrium.
   "God, therefore, as the old saying has it, occupying the beginning, the
   middle, and the end of all that is in being, keeps the straight course,
   while He makes the circuit of nature; and justice always follows Him,
   avenging those who violate the divine law."

   Whence, O Plato, is that hint of the truth which thou givest? Whence
   this rich copiousness of diction, which proclaims piety with oracular
   utterance? The tribes of the barbarians, he says, are wiser than these;
   I know thy teachers, even if thou wouldst conceal them. You have
   learned geometry from the Egyptians, astronomy from the Babylonians;
   the charms of healing you have got from the Thracians; the Assyrians
   also have taught you many things; but for the laws that are consistent
   with truth, and your sentiments respecting God, you are indebted to the
   Hebrews, [923]


   "Who do not worship through vain deceits

   The works of men, of gold, and brass, and silver, and ivory,

   And images of dead men, of wood and stone,

   Which other men, led by their foolish inclinations, worship;

   But raise to heaven pure arms:

   When they rise from bed, purifying themselves with water,

   And worship alone the Eternal, who reigns for ever more."

   And let it not be this one man alone--Plato; but, O philosophy, hasten
   to produce many others also, who declare the only true God to be God,
   through His inspiration, if in any measure they have grasped the truth.
   For Antisthenes did not think out this doctrine of the Cynics; but it
   is in virtue of his being a disciple of Socrates that he says, "that
   God is not like to any; wherefore no one can know Him from an image."
   And Xenophon the Athenian would have in his own person committed freely
   to writing somewhat of the truth, and given the same testimony as
   Socrates, had he not been afraid of the cup of poison, which Socrates
   had to drink. But he hints nothing less; he says: "How great and
   powerful He is who moves all things, and is Himself at rest, is
   manifest; but what He is in form is not revealed. The sun himself,
   intended to be the source of light to all around, does not deem it
   fitting to allow himself to be looked at; but if any one audaciously
   gazes on him, he is deprived of sight." Whence, then, does the son of
   Gryllus learn his wisdom? Is it not manifestly from the prophetess of
   the Hebrews [924] who prophesies in the following style?--


   "What flesh can see with the eye the celestial,

   The true, the immortal God, who inhabits the vault of heaven?

   Nay, men born mortal cannot even stand

   Before the rays of the sun."

   Cleanthes Pisadeus, [925] the Stoic philosopher, who exhibits not a
   poetic theogony, but a true theology, has not concealed what sentiments
   he entertained respecting God:--


   "If you ask me what is the nature of the good, listen:

   That which is regular, just, holy, pious.

   Self-governing, useful, fair, fitting,

   Grave, independent, always beneficial;

   That feels no fear or grief; profitable, painless,

   Helpful, pleasant, safe, friendly;

   Held in esteem, agreeing with itself, honourable;

   Humble, careful, meek, zealous,

   Perennial, blameless, ever-during:

   Mean is every one who looks to opinion

   With the view of obtaining some advantage from it."

   Here, as I think, he clearly teaches of what nature God is; and that
   the common opinion and religious customs enslave those that follow
   them, but seek not after God.

   We must not either keep the Pythagoreans in the background, who say:
   "God is one; and He is not, as some suppose, outside of this frame of
   things, but within it; but, in all the entireness of His being, is in
   the whole circle of existence, surveying all nature, and blending in
   harmonious union the whole,--the author of all His own forces and
   works, the giver of light in heaven, and Father of all,--the mind and
   vital power of the whole world,--the mover of all things." For the
   knowledge of God, these utterances, written by those we have mentioned
   through the inspiration of God, and selected by us, may suffice even
   for the man that has but small power to examine into truth.

      Chapter VII.--The Poets Also Bear Testimony to the Truth.

   Let poetry also approach to us (for philosophy alone will not suffice):
   poetry which is wholly occupied with falsehood--which scarcely will
   make confession of the truth, but will rather own to God its deviations
   into fable. Let whoever of those poets chooses advance first. Aratus
   considers that the power of God pervades all things:--


   "That all may be secure,

   Him ever they propitiate first and last,

   Hail, Father I great marvel, great gain to man."

   Thus also the Ascræan Hesiod dimly speaks of God:--


   "For He is the King of all, and monarch

   Of the immortals; and there is none that may vie

   with Him in power."

   Also on the stage they reveal the truth:--


   "Look on the ether and heaven, and regard that as God,"

   says Euripides. And Sophocles, the son of Sophilus, says:--


   "One, in truth, one is God,

   Who made both heaven and the far-stretching earth,

   And ocean's blue wave, and the mighty winds;

   But many of us mortals, deceived in heart,

   Have set up for ourselves, as a consolation in our afflictions,

   Images of the gods of stone, or wood, or brass,

   Or gold, or ivory;

   And, appointing to those sacrifices and vain festal assemblages,

   Are accustomed thus to practice religion."

   In this venturous manner has he on the stage brought truth before the
   spectators. But the Thracian Orpheus, the son of OEagrus, hierophant
   and poet at once, after his exposition of the orgies, and his theology
   of idols, introduces a palinode of truth with true solemnity, though
   tardily singing the strain:--


   "I shall utter to whom it is lawful; but let the doors be closed,

   Nevertheless, against all the profane. But do thou hear,

   O Musæus, offspring of the light-bringing moon,

   For I will declare what is true. And let not these things

   Which once appeared in your breast rob you of dear life;

   But looking to the divine word, apply yourself to it,

   Keeping right the seat of intellect and feeling; and walk well

   In the straight path, and to the immortal King of the universe alone

   Direct your gaze."

   Then proceeding, he clearly adds:--


   "He is one, self-proceeding; and from Him alone all things proceed,

   And in them He Himself exerts his activity: no mortal

   Beholds Him, but He beholds all."

   Thus far Orpheus at last understood that he had been in error:--


   "But linger no longer, O man, endued with varied wisdom;

   But turn and retrace your steps, and propitiate God."

   For if, at the most, the Greeks, having received certain scintillations
   of the divine word, have given forth some utterances of truth, they
   bear indeed witness that the force of truth is not hidden, and at the
   same time expose their own weakness in not having arrived at the end.
   For I think it has now become evident to all, that those who do or
   speak aught without the word of truth are like people compelled to walk
   without feet. Let the strictures on your gods, which the poets,
   impelled by the force of truth, introduce in their comedies, shame you
   into salvation. Menander, for instance, the comic poet, in his drama of
   the Charioteer, says:--


   "No God pleases me that goes about

   With an old woman, and enters houses

   Carrying a trencher."

   For such are the begging priests of Cybele. Hence Antisthenes replies
   appropriately to their request for alms:--


   "I do not maintain the mother of the gods,

   For the gods maintain her."

   Again, the same writer of comedy, expressing his dissatisfaction with
   the common usages, tries to expose the impious arrogance of the
   prevailing error in the drama of the Priestess, sagely declaring:--


   "If a man drags the Deity

   Whither he will by the sound of cymbals,

   He that does this is greater than the Deity;

   But these are the instruments of audacity and means of living

   Invented by men."

   And not only Menander, but Homer also, and Euripides, and other poets
   in great numbers, expose your gods, and are wont to rate them, and that
   soundly too. For instance, they call Aphrodite dog-fly, and Hephæstus a
   cripple. Helen says to Aphrodite:--


   "Thy godship abdicate!

   Renounce Olympus!" [926]

   And of Dionysus, Homer writes without reserve:--


   "He, mid their frantic orgies, in the groves

   Of lovely Nyssa, put to shameful rout

   The youthful Bacchus' nurses; they in fear,

   Dropped each her thyrsus, scattered by the hand

   Of fierce Lycurgus, with an ox-goad armed." [927]

   Worthy truly of the Socratic school is Euripides, who fixes his eye on
   truth, and despises the spectators of his plays. On one occasion,
   Apollo,


   "Who inhabits the sanctuary that is in the middle of the earth,

   Dispensing most certain oracles to mortals,"

   is thus exposed:--


   "It was in obedience to him that I killed her who brought me forth;

   Him do you regard as stained with guilt--put him to death;

   It was he that sinned, not I, uninstructed as I was

   In right and justice." [928]

   He introduces Heracles, at one time mad, at another drunk and
   gluttonous. How should he not so represent the god who, when
   entertained as a guest, ate green figs to flesh, uttering discordant
   howls, that even his barbarian host remarked it? In his drama of Ion,
   too, he barefacedly brings the gods on the stage:--


   "How, then, is it right for you, who have given laws to mortals,

   To be yourselves guilty of wrong?

   And if--what will never take place, yet I will state the supposition--

   You will give satisfaction to men for your adulteries,

   You, Poseidon, and you, Zeus, the ruler of heaven,--

   You will, in order to make recompense for your misdeeds,

   Have to empty your temples." [929]

      Chapter VIII.--The True Doctrine is to Be Sought in the Prophets.

   It is now time, as we have despatched in order the other points, to go
   to the prophetic Scriptures; for the oracles present us with the
   appliances necessary for the attainment of piety, and so establish the
   truth. The divine Scriptures and institutions of wisdom form the short
   road to salvation. Devoid of embellishment, of outward beauty of
   diction, of wordiness and seductiveness, they raise up humanity
   strangled by wickedness, teaching men to despise the casualties of
   life; and with one and the same voice remedying many evils, they at
   once dissuade us from pernicious deceit, and clearly exhort us to the
   attainment of the salvation set before us. Let the Sibyl [930]
   prophetess, then, be the first to sing to us the song of salvation:--


   "So He is all sure and unerring:

   Come, follow no longer darkness and gloom;

   See, the sun's sweet-glancing light shines gloriously.

   Know, and lay up wisdom in your hearts:

   There is one God, who sends rains, and winds, and earthquakes,

   Thunderbolts, famines, plagues, and dismal sorrows,

   And snows and ice. But why detail particulars?

   He reigns over heaven, He rules earth,

   He truly is;"--

   where, in remarkable accordance with inspiration [931] she compares
   delusion to darkness, and the knowledge of God to the sun and light,
   and subjecting both to comparison, shows the choice we ought to make.
   For falsehood is not dissipated by the bare presentation of the truth,
   but by the practical improvement of the truth it is ejected and put to
   flight.

   Jeremiah the prophet, gifted with consummate wisdom, [932] or rather
   the Holy Spirit in Jeremiah, exhibits God. "Am I a God at hand," he
   says, "and not a God afar off? Shall a man do ought in secret, and I
   not see him? Do I not fill heaven and earth? Saith the Lord." [933]

   And again by Isaiah, "Who shall measure heaven with a span, and the
   whole earth with his hand?" [934] Behold God's greatness, and be filled
   with amazement. Let us worship Him of whom the prophet says, "Before
   Thy face the hills shall melt, as wax melteth before the fire!" [935]
   This, says he, is the God "whose throne is heaven, and His footstool
   the earth; and if He open heaven, quaking will seize thee." [936] Will
   you hear, too, what this prophet says of idols? "And they shall be made
   a spectacle of in the face of the sun, and their carcases shall be meat
   for the fowls of heaven and the wild beasts of the earth; and they
   shall putrefy before the sun and the moon, which they have loved and
   served; and their city shall be burned down." [937] He says, too, that
   the elements and the world shall be destroyed. "The earth," he says,
   "shall grow old, and the heaven shall pass away; but the word of the
   Lord endureth for ever." What, then, when again God wishes to show
   Himself by Moses: "Behold ye, behold ye, that I Am, and there is no
   other God beside Me. I will kill, and I will make to live; I will
   strike, and I will heal; and there is none who shall deliver out of My
   hands." [938] But do you wish to hear another seer? You have the whole
   prophetic choir, the associates of Moses. What the Holy Spirit says by
   Hosea, I will not shrink from quoting: "Lo, I am He that appointeth the
   thunder, and createth spirit; and His hands have established the host
   of heaven." [939] And once more by Isaiah. And this utterance I will
   repeat: "I am," he says, "I am the Lord; I who speak righteousness,
   announce truth. Gather yourselves together, and come. Take counsel
   together, ye that are saved from the nations. They have not known, they
   who set up the block of wood, their carved work, and pray to gods who
   will not save them." [940] Then proceeding: "I am God, and there is not
   beside Me a just God, and a Saviour: there is none except Me. Turn to
   Me, and ye will be saved, ye that are from the end of the earth. I am
   God, and there is no other; by Myself I swear." [941] But against the
   worshippers of idols he is exasperated, saying, "To whom will ye liken
   the Lord, or to what likeness will ye compare Him? Has not the
   artificer made the image, or the goldsmith melted the gold and plated
   it with gold?" [942] --and so on. Be not therefore idolaters, but even
   now beware of the threatenings; "for the graven images and the works of
   men's hands shall wail, or rather they that trust in them," [943] for
   matter is devoid of sensation. Once more he says, "The Lord will shake
   the cities that are inhabited, and grasp the world in His hand like a
   nest." [944] Why repeat to you the mysteries of wisdom, and sayings
   from the writings of the son of the Hebrews, the master of wisdom? "The
   Lord created me the beginning of His ways, in order to His works."
   [945] And, "The Lord giveth wisdom, and from His face proceed knowledge
   and understanding." [946] "How long wilt thou lie in bed, O sluggard;
   and when wilt thou be aroused from sleep?" [947] "but if thou show
   thyself no sluggard, as a fountain thy harvest shall come," [948] the
   "Word of the Father, the benign light, the Lord that bringeth light,
   faith to all, and salvation." [949] For "the Lord who created the earth
   by His power," as Jeremiah says, "has raised up the world by His
   wisdom;" [950] for wisdom, which is His word, raises us up to the
   truth, who have fallen prostrate before idols, and is itself the first
   resurrection from our fall. Whence Moses, the man of God, dissuading
   from all idolatry, beautifully exclaims, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy
   God is one Lord; and thou shall worship the Lord thy God, and Him only
   shall thou serve." [951] "Now therefore be wise, O men," according to
   that blessed psalmist David; "lay hold on instruction, lest the Lord be
   angry, and ye perish from the way of righteousness, when His wrath has
   quickly kindled. Blessed are all they who put their trust in Him."
   [952] But already the Lord, in His surpassing pity, has inspired the
   song of salvation, sounding like a battle march, "Sons of men, how long
   will ye be slow of heart? Why do you love vanity, and seek after a
   lie?" [953] What, then, is the vanity, and what the lie? The holy
   apostle of the Lord, reprehending the Greeks, will show thee: "Because
   that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were
   thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and changed the glory
   of God into the likeness of corruptible man, and worshipped and served
   the creature more than the Creator." [954] And verily this is the God
   who "in the beginning made the heaven and the earth." [955] But you do
   not know God, and worship the heaven, and how shall you escape the
   guilt of impiety? Hear again the prophet speaking: "The sun, shall
   suffer eclipse, and the heaven be darkened; but the Almighty shall
   shine for ever: while the powers of the heavens shall be shaken, and
   the heavens stretched out and drawn together shall be rolled as a
   parchment-skin (for these are the prophetic expressions), and the earth
   shall flee away from before the face of the Lord." [956]

      Chapter IX.--"That Those Grievously Sin Who Despise or Neglect God's
      Gracious Calling."

   I could adduce ten thousand Scriptures of which not "one tittle shall
   pass away," [957] without being fulfilled; for the mouth of the Lord
   the Holy Spirit hath spoken these things. "Do not any longer," he says,
   "my son, despise the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art
   rebuked of Him." [958] O surpassing love for man! Not as a teacher
   speaking to his pupils, not as a master to his domestics, nor as God to
   men, but as a father, does the Lord gently admonish his children. Thus
   Moses confesses that "he was filled with quaking and terror" [959]
   while he listened to God speaking concerning the Word. And art not thou
   afraid as thou hearest the voice of the Divine Word? Art not thou
   distressed? Do you not fear, and hasten to learn of Him,--that is, to
   salvation,--dreading wrath, loving grace, eagerly striving after the
   hope set before us, that you may shun the judgment threatened? Come,
   come, O my young people! For if you become not again as little
   children, and be born again, as saith the Scripture, you shall not
   receive the truly existent Father, nor shall you ever enter into the
   kingdom of heaven. For in what way is a stranger permitted to enter?
   Well, as I take it, then, when he is enrolled and made a citizen, and
   receives one to stand to him in the relation of father, then will he be
   occupied with the Father's concerns, then shall he be deemed worthy to
   be made His heir, then will he share the kingdom of the Father with His
   own dear Son. For this is the first-born Church, composed of many good
   children; these are "the first-born enrolled in heaven, who hold high
   festival with so many myriads of angels." We, too, are first-born sons,
   who are reared by God, who are the genuine friends of the First-born,
   who first of all other men attained to the knowledge of God, who first
   were wrenched away from our sins, first severed from the devil. And now
   the more benevolent God is, the more impious men are; for He desires us
   from slaves to become sons, while they scorn to become sons. O the
   prodigious folly of being ashamed of the Lord! He offers freedom, you
   flee into bondage; He bestows salvation, you sink down into
   destruction; He confers everlasting life, you wait for punishment, and
   prefer the fire which the Lord "has prepared for the devil and his
   angels." [960] Wherefore the blessed apostle says: "I testify in the
   Lord, that ye walk no longer as the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of
   their mind; having their understanding darkened, being alienated from
   the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the
   hardness of their heart: who, being past feeling, have given themselves
   over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness and concupiscence."
   [961] After the accusation of such a witness, and his invocation of
   God, what else remains for the unbelieving than judgment and
   condemnation? And the Lord, with ceaseless assiduity, exhorts,
   terrifies, urges, rouses, admonishes; He awakes from the sleep of
   darkness, and raises up those who have wandered in error. "Awake," He
   says, "thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall
   give thee light," [962] --Christ, the Sun of the Resurrection, He "who
   was born before the morning star," [963] and with His beams bestows
   life. Let no one then despise the Word, lest he unwittingly despise
   himself. For the Scripture somewhere says, "To-day, if ye will hear His
   voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
   temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers proved Me by trial."
   [964] And what was the trial? If you wish to learn, the Holy Spirit
   will show you: "And saw my works," He says, "forty years. Wherefore I
   was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in
   heart, and have not known My ways. So I sware in my wrath, they shall
   not enter into My rest." [965] Look to the threatening! Look to the
   exhortation! Look to the punishment! Why, then, should we any longer
   change grace into wrath, and not receive the word with open ears, and
   entertain God as a guest in pure spirits? For great is the grace of His
   promise, "if to-day we hear His voice." [966] And that to-day is
   lengthened out day by day, while it is called to-day. And to the end
   the to-day and the instruction continue; and then the true to-day, the
   never-ending day of God, extends over eternity. Let us then ever obey
   the voice of the divine word. For the to-day signifies eternity. And
   day is the symbol of light; and the light of men is the Word, by whom
   we behold God. Rightly, then, to those that have believed and obey,
   grace will superabound; while with those that have been unbelieving,
   and err in heart, and have not known the Lord's ways, which John
   commanded to make straight and to prepare, God is incensed, and those
   He threatens.

   And, indeed, the old Hebrew wanderers in the desert received typically
   the end of the threatening; for they are said not to have entered into
   the rest, because of unbelief, till, having followed the successor of
   Moses, they learned by experience, though late, that they could not be
   saved otherwise than by believing on Jesus. But the Lord, in His love
   to man, invites all men to the knowledge of the truth, and for this end
   sends the Paraclete. What, then, is this knowledge? Godliness; and
   "godliness," according to Paul, "is profitable for all things, having
   the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
   [967] If eternal salvation were to be sold, for how much, O men, would
   you propose to purchase it? Were one to estimate the value of the whole
   of Pactolus, the fabulous river of gold, he would not have reckoned up
   a price equivalent to salvation.

   Do not, however, faint. You may, if you choose, purchase salvation,
   though of inestimable value, with your own resources, love and living
   faith, which will be reckoned a suitable price. This recompense God
   cheerfully accepts; "for we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour
   of all men, especially of those who believe." [968]

   But the rest, round whom the world's growths have fastened, as the
   rocks on the sea-shore are covered over with sea-weed, make light of
   immortality, like the old man of Ithaca, eagerly longing to see, not
   the truth, not the fatherland in heaven, not the true light, but smoke.
   But godliness, that makes man as far as can be like God, designates God
   as our suitable teacher, who alone can worthily assimilate man to God.
   This teaching the apostle knows as truly divine. "Thou, O Timothy," he
   says, "from a child hast known the holy letters, which are able to make
   thee wise unto salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus." [969]
   For truly holy are those letters that sanctify and deify; and the
   writings or volumes that consist of those holy letters and syllables,
   the same apostle consequently calls "inspired of God, being profitable
   for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
   righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished
   to every good work." [970] No one will be so impressed by the
   exhortations of any of the saints, as he is by the words of the Lord
   Himself, the lover of man. For this, and nothing but this, is His only
   work--the salvation of man. Therefore He Himself, urging them on to
   salvation, cries, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand." [971] Those men
   that draw near through fear, He converts. Thus also the apostle of the
   Lord, beseeching the Macedonians, becomes the interpreter of the divine
   voice, when he says, "The Lord is at hand; take care that ye be not
   apprehended empty." [972] But are ye so devoid of fear, or rather of
   faith, as not to believe the Lord Himself, or Paul, who in Christ's
   stead thus entreats: "Taste and see that Christ is God?" [973] Faith
   will lead you in; experience will teach you; Scripture will train you,
   for it says, "Come hither, O children; listen to me, and I will teach
   you the fear of the Lord." Then, as to those who already believe, it
   briefly adds, "What man is he that desireth life, that loveth to see
   good days?" [974] It is we, we shall say--we who are the devotees of
   good, we who eagerly desire good things. Hear, then, ye who are far
   off, hear ye who are near: the word has not been hidden from any; light
   is common, it shines "on all men." No one is a Cimmerian in respect to
   the word. Let us haste to salvation, to regeneration; let us who are
   many haste that we may be brought together into one love, according to
   the union of the essential unity; and let us, by being made good,
   conformably follow after union, seeking after the good Monad.

   The union of many in one, issuing in the production of divine harmony
   out of a medley of sounds and division, becomes one symphony following
   one choir-leader and teacher, [975] the Word, reaching and resting in
   the same truth, and crying Abba, Father. This, the true utterance of
   His children, God accepts with gracious welcome--the first-fruits He
   receives from them.

      Chapter X.--Answer to the Objection of the Heathen, that It Was Not Right
      to Abandon the Customs of Their Fathers.

   But you say it is not creditable to subvert the customs handed down to
   us from our fathers. And why, then, do we not still use our first
   nourishment, milk, to which our nurses accustomed us from the time of
   our birth? Why do we increase or diminish our patrimony, and not keep
   it exactly the same as we got it? Why do we not still vomit on our
   parents' breasts, or still do the things for which, when infants, and
   nursed by our mothers, we were laughed at, but have corrected
   ourselves, even if we did not fall in with good instructors? Then, if
   excesses in the indulgence of the passions, though pernicious and
   dangerous, yet are accompanied with pleasure, why do we not in the
   conduct of life abandon that usage which is evil, and provocative of
   passion, and godless, even should our fathers feel hurt, and betake
   ourselves to the truth, and seek Him who is truly our Father, rejecting
   custom as a deleterious drug? For of all that I have undertaken to do,
   the task I now attempt is the noblest, viz., to demonstrate to you how
   inimical this insane and most wretched custom is to godliness. For a
   boon so great, the greatest ever given by God to the human race, would
   never have been hated and rejected, had not you been carried away by
   custom, and then shut your ears against us; and just as unmanageable
   horses throw off the reins, and take the bit between their teeth, you
   rush away from the arguments addressed to you, in your eager desire to
   shake yourselves clear of us, who seek to guide the chariot of your
   life, and, impelled by your folly, dash towards the precipices of
   destruction, and regard the holy word of God as an accursed thing. The
   reward of your choice, therefore, as described by Sophocles, follows:--


   "The mind a blank, useless ears, vain thoughts."

   And you know not that, of all truths, this is the truest, that the good
   and godly shall obtain the good reward, inasmuch as they held goodness
   in high esteem; while, on the other hand, the wicked shall receive meet
   punishment. For the author of evil, torment has been prepared; and so
   the prophet Zecharias threatens him: "He that hath chosen Jerusalem
   rebuke thee; lo, is not this a brand plucked from the fire?" [976] What
   an infatuated desire, then, for voluntary death is this, rooted in
   men's minds! Why do they flee to this fatal brand, with which they
   shall be burned, when it is within their power to live nobly according
   to God, and not according to custom? For God bestows life freely; but
   evil custom, after our departure from this world, brings on the sinner
   unavailing remorse with punishment. By sad experience, even a child
   knows how superstition destroys and piety saves. Let any of you look at
   those who minister before the idols, their hair matted, their persons
   disgraced with filthy and tattered clothes; who never come near a bath,
   and let their nails grow to an extraordinary length, like wild beasts;
   many of them castrated, who show the idol's temples to be in reality
   graves or prisons. These appear to me to bewail the gods, not to
   worship them, and their sufferings to be worthy of pity rather than
   piety. And seeing these things, do you still continue blind, and will
   you not look up to the Ruler of all, the Lord of the universe? And will
   you not escape from those dungeons, and flee to the mercy that comes
   down from heaven? For God, of His great love to man, comes to the help
   of man, as the mother-bird flies to one of her young that has fallen
   out of the nest; and if a serpent open its mouth to swallow the little
   bird, "the mother flutters round, uttering cries of grief over her dear
   progeny;" [977] and God the Father seeks His creature, and heals his
   transgression, and pursues the serpent, and recovers the young one, and
   incites it to fly up to the nest.

   Thus dogs that have strayed, track out their master by the scent; and
   horses that have thrown their riders, come to their master's call if he
   but whistle. "The ox," it is said, "knoweth his owner, and the ass his
   master's crib; but Israel hath not known Me." [978] What, then, of the
   Lord? He remembers not our ill desert; He still pities, He still urges
   us to repentance.

   And I would ask you, if it does not appear to you monstrous, that you
   men who are God's handiwork, who have received your souls from Him, and
   belong wholly to God, should be subject to another master, and, what is
   more, serve the tyrant instead of the rightful King--the evil one
   instead of the good? For, in the name of truth, what man in his senses
   turns his back on good, and attaches himself to evil? What, then, is he
   who flees from God to consort with demons? Who, that may become a son
   of God, prefers to be in bondage? Or who is he that pursues his way to
   Erebus, when it is in his power to be a citizen of heaven, and to
   cultivate Paradise, and walk about in heaven and partake of the tree of
   life and immortality, and, cleaving his way through the sky in the
   track of the luminous cloud, behold, like Elias, the rain of salvation?
   Some there are, who, like worms wallowing in marshes and mud in the
   streams of pleasure, feed on foolish and useless delights--swinish men.
   For swine, it is said, like mud better than pure water; and, according
   to Democritus, "doat upon dirt."

   Let us not then be enslaved or become swinish; but, as true children of
   the light, let us raise our eyes and look on the light, lest the Lord
   discover us to be spurious, as the sun does the eagles. Let us
   therefore repent, and pass from ignorance to knowledge, from
   foolishness to wisdom, from licentiousness to self-restraint, from
   unrighteousness to righteousness, from godlessness to God. It is an
   enterprise of noble daring to take our way to God; and the enjoyment of
   many other good things is within the reach of the lovers of
   righteousness, who pursue eternal life, specially those things to which
   God Himself alludes, speaking by Isaiah: "There is an inheritance for
   those who serve the Lord." [979] Noble and desirable is this
   inheritance: not gold, not silver, not raiment, which the moth assails,
   and things of earth which are assailed by the robber, whose eye is
   dazzled by worldly wealth; but it is that treasure of salvation to
   which we must hasten, by becoming lovers of the Word. Thence
   praise-worthy works descend to us, and fly with us on the wing of
   truth. This is the inheritance with which the eternal covenant of God
   invests us, conveying the everlasting gift of grace; and thus our
   loving Father--the true Father--ceases not to exhort, admonish, train,
   love us. For He ceases not to save, and advises the best course:
   "Become righteous," says the Lord. [980] Ye that thirst, come to the
   water; and ye that have no money, come, and buy and drink without
   money. [981] He invites to the laver, to salvation, to illumination,
   all but crying out and saying, The land I give thee, and the sea, my
   child, and heaven too; and all the living creatures in them I freely
   bestow upon thee. Only, O child, thirst for thy Father; God shall be
   revealed to thee without price; the truth is not made merchandise of.
   He gives thee all creatures that fly and swim, and those on the land.
   These the Father has created for thy thankful enjoyment. What the
   bastard, who is a son of perdition, foredoomed to be the slave of
   mammon, has to buy for money, He assigns to thee as thine own, even to
   His own son who loves the Father; for whose sake He still works, and to
   whom alone He promises, saying, "The land shall not be sold in
   perpetuity," for it is not destined to corruption. "For the whole land
   is mine;" and it is thine too, if thou receive God. Wherefore the
   Scripture, as might have been expected, proclaims good news to those
   who have believed. "The saints of the Lord shall inherit the glory of
   God and His power." What glory, tell me, O blessed One, which "eye hath
   not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man;"
   [982] and "they shall be glad in the kingdom of their Lord for ever and
   ever! Amen." You have, O men, the divine promise of grace; you have
   heard, on the other hand, the threatening of punishment: by these the
   Lord saves, teaching men by fear and grace. Why do we delay? Why do we
   not shun the punishment? Why do we not receive the free gift? Why, in
   fine, do we not choose the better part, God instead of the evil one,
   and prefer wisdom to idolatry, and take life in exchange for death?
   "Behold," He says, "I have set before your face death and life." [983]
   The Lord tries you, that "you may choose life." He counsels you as a
   father to obey God. "For if ye hear Me," He says, "and be willing, ye
   shall eat the good things of the land:" [984] this is the grace
   attached to obedience. "But if ye obey Me not, and are unwilling, the
   sword and fire shall devour you:" [985] this is the penalty of
   disobedience. For the mouth of the Lord--the law of truth, the word of
   the Lord--hath spoken these things. Are you willing that I should be
   your good counsellor? Well, do you hear. I, if possible, will explain.
   You ought, O men, when reflecting on the Good, to have brought forward
   a witness inborn and competent, viz., faith, which of itself, and from
   its own resources, chooses at once what is best, instead of occupying
   yourselves in painfully inquiring whether what is best ought to be
   followed. For, allow me to tell you, you ought to doubt whether you
   should get drunk, but you get drunk before reflecting on the matter;
   and whether you ought to do an injury, but you do injury with the
   utmost readiness. The only thing you make the subject of question is,
   whether God should be worshipped, and whether this wise God and Christ
   should be followed: and this you think requires deliberation and doubt,
   and know not what is worthy of God. Have faith in us, as you have in
   drunkenness, that you may be wise; have faith in us, as you have in
   injury, that you may live. But if, acknowledging the conspicuous
   trustworthiness of the virtues, you wish to trust them, come and I will
   set before you in abundance, materials of persuasion respecting the
   Word. But do you--for your ancestral customs, by which your minds are
   preoccupied, divert you from the truth,--do you now hear what is the
   real state of the case as follows.

   And let not any shame of this name preoccupy you, which does great harm
   to men, and seduces them from salvation. Let us then openly strip for
   the contest, and nobly strive in the arena of truth, the holy Word
   being the judge, and the Lord of the universe prescribing the contest.
   For 'tis no insignificant prize, the guerdon of immortality which is
   set before us. Pay no more regard, then, if you are rated by some of
   the low rabble who lead the dance of impiety, and are driven on to the
   same pit by their folly and insanity, makers of idols and worshippers
   of stones. For these have dared to deify men,--Alexander of Macedon,
   for example, whom they canonized as the thirteenth god, whose
   pretensions Babylon confuted, which showed him dead. I admire,
   therefore, the divine sophist. Theocritus was his name. After
   Alexander's death, Theocritus, holding up the vain opinions entertained
   by men respecting the gods, to ridicule before his fellow-citizens,
   said: "Men, keep up your hearts as long as you see the gods dying
   sooner than men." And, truly, he who worships gods that are visible,
   and the promiscuous rabble of creatures begotten and born, and attaches
   himself to them, is a far more wretched object than the very demons.
   For God is by no manner of means unrighteous, as the demons are, but in
   the very highest degree righteous; and nothing more resembles God than
   one of us when he becomes righteous in the highest possible degree:--


   "Go into the way, the whole tribe of you handicrafts-men,

   Who worship Jove's fierce-eyed daughter, [986] the working goddess,

   With fans duly placed, fools that ye are"--

   fashioners of stones, and worshippers of them. Let your Phidias, and
   Polycletus, and your Praxiteles and Apelles too, come, and all that are
   engaged in mechanical arts, who, being themselves of the earth, are
   workers of the earth. "For then," says a certain prophecy, "the affairs
   here turn out unfortunately, when men put their trust in images." Let
   the meaner artists, too--for I will not stop calling--come. None of
   these ever made a breathing image, or out of earth moulded soft flesh.
   Who liquefied the marrow? or who solidified the bones? Who stretched
   the nerves? who distended the veins? Who poured the blood into them? Or
   who spread the skin? Who ever could have made eyes capable of seeing?
   Who breathed spirit into the lifeless form? Who bestowed righteousness?
   Who promised immortality? The Maker of the universe alone; the Great
   Artist and Father has formed us, such a living image as man is. But
   your Olympian Jove, the image of an image, greatly out of harmony with
   truth, is the senseless work of Attic hands. For the image of God is
   His Word, the genuine Son of Mind, the Divine Word, the archetypal
   light of light; and the image of the Word is the true man, the mind
   which is in man, who is therefore said to have been made "in the image
   and likeness of God," [987] assimilated to the Divine Word in the
   affections of the soul, and therefore rational; but effigies sculptured
   in human form, the earthly image of that part of man which is visible
   and earth-born, are but a perishable impress of humanity, manifestly
   wide of the truth. That life, then, which is occupied with so much
   earnestness about matter, seems to me to be nothing else than full of
   insanity. And custom, which has made you taste bondage and unreasonable
   care, is fostered by vain opinion; and ignorance, which has proved to
   the human race the cause of unlawful rites and delusive shows, and also
   of deadly plagues and hateful images, has, by devising many shapes of
   demons, stamped on all that follow it the mark of long-continued death.
   Receive, then, the water of the word; wash, ye polluted ones; purify
   yourselves from custom, by sprinkling yourselves with the drops of
   truth. [988] The pure must ascend to heaven. Thou art a man, if we look
   to that which is most common to thee and others--seek Him who created
   thee; thou art a son, if we look to that which is thy peculiar
   prerogative--acknowledge thy Father. But do you still continue in your
   sins, engrossed with pleasures? To whom shall the Lord say, "Yours is
   the kingdom of heaven?" Yours, whose choice is set on God, if you will;
   yours, if you will only believe, and comply with the brief terms of the
   announcement; which the Ninevites having obeyed, instead of the
   destruction they looked for, obtained a signal deliverance. How, then,
   may I ascend to heaven, is it said? The Lord is the way; a strait way,
   but leading from heaven, strait in truth, but leading back to heaven,
   strait, despised on earth; broad, adored in heaven.

   Then, he that is uninstructed in the word, has ignorance as the excuse
   of his error; but as for him into whose ears instruction has been
   poured, and who deliberately maintains his incredulity in his soul, the
   wiser he appears to be, the more harm will his understanding do him;
   for he has his own sense as his accuser for not having chosen the best
   part. For man has been otherwise constituted by nature, so as to have
   fellowship with God. As, then, we do not compel the horse to plough, or
   the bull to hunt, but set each animal to that for which it is by nature
   fitted; so, placing our finger on what is man's peculiar and
   distinguishing characteristic above other creatures, we invite
   him--born, as he is, for the contemplation of heaven, and being, as he
   is, a truly heavenly plant--to the knowledge of God, counselling him to
   furnish himself with what is his sufficient provision for eternity,
   namely piety. Practise husbandry, we say, if you are a husbandman; but
   while you till your fields, know God. Sail the sea, you who are devoted
   to navigation, yet call the whilst on the heavenly Pilot. [989] Has
   knowledge taken hold of you while engaged in military service? Listen
   to the commander, who orders what is right. As those, then, who have
   been overpowered with sleep and drunkenness, do ye awake; and using
   your eyes a little, consider what mean those stones which you worship,
   and the expenditure you frivolously lavish on matter. Your means and
   substance you squander on ignorance, even as you throw away your lives
   to death, having found no other end of your vain hope than this. Not
   only unable to pity yourselves, you are incapable even of yielding to
   the persuasions of those who commiserate you; enslaved as you are to
   evil custom, and, clinging to it voluntarily till your last breath, you
   are hurried to destruction: "because light is come into the world, and
   men have loved the darkness rather than the light," [990] while they
   could sweep away those hindrances to salvation, pride, and wealth, and
   fear, repeating this poetic utterance:--


   "Whither do I bear these abundant riches? and whither

   Do I myself wander?" [991]

   If you wish, then, to cast aside these vain phantasies, and bid adieu
   to evil custom, say to vain opinion:--


   "Lying dreams, farewell; you were then nothing."

   For what, think you, O men, is the Hermes of Typho, and that of
   Andocides, and that of Amyetus? Is it not evident to all that they are
   stones, as is the veritable Hermes himself? As the Halo is not a god,
   and as the Iris is not a god, but are states of the atmosphere and of
   the clouds; and as, likewise, a day is not a god, nor a year, nor time,
   which is made up of these, so neither is sun nor moon, by which each of
   those mentioned above is determined. Who, then, in his right senses,
   can imagine Correction, and Punishment, and Justice, and Retribution to
   be gods? For neither the Furies, nor the Fates, nor Destiny are gods,
   since neither Government, nor Glory, nor Wealth are gods, which last
   [as Plutus] painters represent as blind. But if you deify Modesty, and
   Love, and Venus, let these be followed by Infamy, and Passion, and
   Beauty, and Intercourse. Therefore Sleep and Death cannot reasonably
   any more be regarded as twin deities, being merely changes which take
   place naturally in living creatures; no more will you with propriety
   call Fortune, or Destiny, or the Fates goddesses. And if Strife and
   Battle be not gods, no more are Ares and Enyo. Still further, if the
   lightnings, and thunderbolts, and rains are not gods, how can fire and
   water be gods? how can shooting stars and comets, which are produced by
   atmospheric changes? He who calls Fortune a god, let him also so call
   Action. If, then, none of these, nor of the images formed by human
   hands, and destitute of feeling, is held to be a God, while a
   providence exercised about us is evidently the result of a divine
   power, [992] it remains only to acknowledge this, that He alone who is
   truly God, only truly is and subsists. But those who are insensible to
   this are like men who have drunk mandrake or some other drug. May God
   grant that you may at length awake from this slumber, and know God; and
   that neither Gold, nor Stone, nor Tree, nor Action, nor Suffering, nor
   Disease, nor Fear, may appear in your eyes as a god. For there are, in
   sooth, "on the fruitful earth thrice ten thousand" demons, not
   immortal, nor indeed mortal; for they are not endowed with sensation,
   so as to render them capable of death, but only things of wood and
   stone, that hold despotic sway over men insulting and violating life
   through the force of custom. "The earth is the Lord's," it is said,
   "and the fulness thereof." [993] Then why darest thou, while
   luxuriating in the bounties of the Lord, to ignore the Sovereign Ruler?
   "Leave my earth," the Lord will say to thee. "Touch not the water which
   I bestow. Partake not of the fruits of the earth produced by my
   husbandry." Give to God recompense for your sustenance; acknowledge thy
   Master. Thou art God's creature. What belongs to Him, how can it with
   justice be alienated? For that which is alienated, being deprived of
   the properties that belonged to it, is also deprived of truth. For,
   after the fashion of Niobe, or, to express myself more mystically, like
   the Hebrew woman called by the ancients Lot's wife, are ye not turned
   into a state of insensibility? This woman, we have heard, was turned
   into stone for her love of Sodom. And those who are godless, addicted
   to impiety, hard-hearted and foolish, are Sodomites. Believe that these
   utterances are addressed to you from God. For think not that stones,
   and stocks, and birds, and serpents are sacred things, and men are not;
   but, on the contrary, regard men as truly sacred, [994] and take beasts
   and stones for what they are. For there are miserable wretches of human
   kind, who consider that God utters His voice by the raven and the
   jackdaw, but says nothing by man; and honour the raven as a messenger
   of God. But the man of God, who croaks not, nor chatters, but speaks
   rationally and instructs lovingly, alas, they persecute; and while he
   is inviting them to cultivate righteousness, they try inhumanly to slay
   him, neither welcoming the grace which comes from above, nor fearing
   the penalty. For they believe not God, nor understand His power, whose
   love to man is ineffable; and His hatred of evil is inconceivable. His
   anger augments punishment against sin; His love bestows blessings on
   repentance. It is the height of wretchedness to be deprived of the help
   which comes from God. Hence this blindness of eyes and dulness of
   hearing are more grievous than other inflictions of the evil one; for
   the one deprives them of heavenly vision, the other robs them of divine
   instruction. But ye, thus maimed as respects the truth, blind in mind,
   deaf in understanding, are not grieved, are not pained, have had no
   desire to see heaven and the Maker of heaven, nor, by fixing your
   choice on salvation, have sought to hear the Creator of the universe,
   and to learn of Him; for no hindrance stands in the way of him who is
   bent on the knowledge of God. Neither childlessness, nor poverty, nor
   obscurity, nor want, can hinder him who eagerly strives after the
   knowledge of God; nor does any one who has conquered [995] by brass or
   iron the true wisdom for himself choose to exchange it, for it is
   vastly preferred to everything else. Christ is able to save in every
   place. For he that is fired with ardour and admiration for
   righteousness, being the lover of One who needs nothing, needs himself
   but little, having treasured up his bliss in nothing but himself and
   God, where is neither moth, [996] robber, nor pirate, but the eternal
   Giver of good. With justice, then, have you been compared to those
   serpents who shut their ears against the charmers. For "their mind,"
   says the Scripture, "is like the serpent, like the deaf adder, which
   stoppeth her ear, and will not hear the voice of the charmers." [997]
   But allow yourselves to feel the influence of the charming strains of
   sanctity, and receive that mild word of ours, and reject the deadly
   poison, that it may be granted to you to divest yourselves as much as
   possible of destruction, as they [998] have been divested of old age.
   Hear me, and do not stop your ears; do not block up the avenues of
   hearing, but lay to heart what is said. Excellent is the medicine of
   immortality! Stop at length your grovelling reptile motions. [999] "For
   the enemies of the Lord," says Scripture, "shall lick the dust." [1000]
   Raise your eyes from earth to the skies, look up to heaven, admire the
   sight, cease watching with outstretched head the heel of the righteous,
   and hindering the way of truth. Be wise and harmless. Perchance the
   Lord will endow you with the wing of simplicity (for He has resolved to
   give wings to those that are earth-born), that you may leave your holes
   and dwell in heaven. Only let us with our whole heart repent, that we
   may be able with our whole heart to contain God. "Trust in Him, all ye
   assembled people; pour out all your hearts before Him." [1001] He says
   to those that have newly abandoned wickedness, "He pities them, and
   fills them with righteousness." Believe Him who is man and God;
   believe, O man. Believe, O man, the living God, who suffered and is
   adored. Believe, ye slaves, [1002] Him who died; believe, all ye of
   human kind, Him who alone is God of all men. Believe, and receive
   salvation as your reward. Seek God, and your soul shall live. He who
   seeks God is busying himself about his own salvation. Hast thou found
   God?--then thou hast life. Let us then seek, in order that we may live.
   The reward of seeking is life with God. "Let all who seek Thee be glad
   and rejoice in Thee; and let them say continually, God be magnified."
   [1003] A noble hymn of God is an immortal man, established in
   righteousness, in whom the oracles of truth are engraved. For where but
   in a soul that is wise can you write truth? where love? where
   reverence? where meekness? Those who have had these divine characters
   impressed on them, ought, I think, to regard wisdom as a fair port
   whence to embark, to whatever lot in life they turn; and likewise to
   deem it the calm haven of salvation: wisdom, by which those who have
   betaken themselves to the Father, have proved good fathers to their
   children; and good parents to their sons, those who have known the Son;
   and good husbands to their wives, those who remember the Bridegroom;
   and good masters to their servants, [1004] those who have been redeemed
   from utter slavery. Oh, happier far the beasts than men involved in
   error! who live in ignorance as you, but do not counterfeit the truth.
   There are no tribes of flatterers among them. Fishes have no
   superstition: the birds worship not a single image; only they look with
   admiration on heaven, since, deprived as they are of reason, they are
   unable to know God. So are you not ashamed for living through so many
   periods of life in impiety, making yourselves more irrational than
   irrational creatures? You were boys, then striplings, then youths, then
   men, but never as yet were you good. If you have respect for old age,
   be wise, now that you have reached life's sunset; and albeit at the
   close of life, acquire the knowledge of God, that the end of life may
   to you prove the beginning of salvation. You have become old in
   superstition; as young, enter on the practice of piety. God regards you
   as innocent children. Let, then, the Athenian follow the laws of Solon,
   and the Argive those of Phoroneus, and the Spartan those of Lycurgus:
   but if thou enrol thyself as one of God's people, heaven is thy
   country, God thy lawgiver. And what are the laws? "Thou shalt not kill;
   thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not seduce boys; thou shalt
   not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt love the Lord
   thy God." [1005] And the complements of these are those laws of reason
   and words of sanctity which are inscribed on men's hearts: "Thou shalt
   love thy neighbour as thyself; to him who strikes thee on the cheek,
   present also the other;" [1006] "thou shalt not lust, for by lust alone
   thou hast committed adultery." [1007] How much better, therefore, is it
   for men from the beginning not to wish to desire things forbidden, than
   to obtain their desires! But ye are not able to endure the austerity of
   salvation; but as we delight in sweet things, and prize them higher for
   the agreeableness of the pleasure they yield, while, on the other hand,
   those bitter things which are distasteful to the palate are curative
   and healing, and the harshness of medicines strengthens people of weak
   stomach, thus custom pleases and tickles; but custom pushes into the
   abyss, while truth conducts to heaven. Harsh it is at first, but a good
   nurse of youth; and it is at once the decorous place where the
   household maids and matrons dwell together, and the sage
   council-chamber. Nor is it difficult to approach, or impossible to
   attain, but is very near us in our very homes; as Moses, endowed with
   all wisdom, says, while referring to it, it has its abode in three
   departments of our constitution--in the hands, the mouth, and the
   heart: a meet emblem this of truth, which is embraced by these three
   things in all--will, action, speech. And be not afraid lest the
   multitude of pleasing objects which rise before you withdraw you from
   wisdom. You yourself will spontaneously surmount the frivolousness of
   custom, as boys when they have become men throw aside their toys. For
   with a celerity unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready
   access, the divine power, casting its radiance on the earth, hath
   filled the universe with the seed of salvation. For it was not without
   divine care that so great a work was accomplished in so brief a space
   by the Lord, who, though despised as to appearance, was in reality
   adored, the expiator of sin, the Saviour, the clement, the Divine Word,
   He that is truly most manifest Deity, He that is made equal to the Lord
   of the universe; because He was His Son, and the Word was in God, not
   disbelieved in by all when He was first preached, nor altogether
   unknown when, assuming the character of man, and fashioning Himself in
   flesh, He enacted the drama of human salvation: for He was a true
   champion and a fellow-champion with the creature. And being
   communicated most speedily to men, having dawned from His Father's
   counsel quicker than the sun, with the most perfect ease He made God
   shine on us. Whence He was and what He was, He showed by what He taught
   and exhibited, manifesting Himself as the Herald of the Covenant, the
   Reconciler, our Saviour, the Word, the Fount of life, the Giver of
   peace, diffused over the whole face of the earth; by whom, so to speak,
   the universe has already become an ocean of blessings. [1008]

      Chapter XI.--How Great are the Benefits Conferred on Man Through the
      Advent of Christ.

   Contemplate a little, if agreeable to you, the divine beneficence. The
   first man, when in Paradise, sported free, because he was the child of
   God; but when he succumbed to pleasure (for the serpent allegorically
   signifies pleasure crawling on its belly, earthly wickedness nourished
   for fuel to the flames), was as a child seduced by lusts, and grew old
   in disobedience; and by disobeying his Father, dishonoured God. Such
   was the influence of pleasure. Man, that had been free by reason of
   simplicity, was found fettered to sins. The Lord then wished to release
   him from his bonds, and clothing Himself with flesh--O divine
   mystery!--vanquished the serpent, and enslaved the tyrant death; and,
   most marvellous of all, man that had been deceived by pleasure, and
   bound fast by corruption, had his hands unloosed, and was set free. O
   mystic wonder! The Lord was laid low, and man rose up; and he that fell
   from Paradise receives as the reward of obedience something greater
   [than Paradise]--namely, heaven itself. Wherefore, since the Word
   Himself has come to us from heaven, we need not, I reckon, go any more
   in search of human learning to Athens and the rest of Greece, and to
   Ionia. For if we have as our teacher Him that filled the universe with
   His holy energies in creation, salvation, beneficence, legislation,
   prophecy, teaching, we have the Teacher from whom all instruction
   comes; and the whole world, with Athens and Greece, has already become
   the domain of the Word. [1009] For you, who believed the poetical fable
   which designated Minos the Cretan as the bosom friend of Zeus, will not
   refuse to believe that we who have become the disciples of God have
   received the only true wisdom; and that which the chiefs of philosophy
   only guessed at, the disciples of Christ have both apprehended and
   proclaimed. And the one whole Christ is not divided: "There is neither
   barbarian, nor Jew, nor Greek, neither male nor female, but a new man,"
   [1010] transformed by God's Holy Spirit. Further, the other counsels
   and precepts are unimportant, and respect particular things,--as, for
   example, if one may marry, take part in public affairs, beget children;
   but the only command that is universal, and over the whole course of
   existence, at all times and in all circumstances, tends to the highest
   end, viz., life, is piety, [1011] --all that is necessary, in order
   that we may live for ever, being that we live in accordance with it.
   Philosophy, however, as the ancients say, is "a long-lived exhortation,
   wooing the eternal love of wisdom;" while the commandment of the Lord
   is far-shining, "enlightening the eyes." Receive Christ, receive sight,
   receive thy light,


   "In order that you may know well both God and man." [1012]

   "Sweet is the Word that gives us light, precious above gold and gems;
   it is to be desired above honey and the honey-comb." [1013] For how can
   it be other than desirable, since it has filled with light the mind
   which had been buried in darkness, and given keenness to the
   "light-bringing eyes" of the soul? For just as, had the sun not been in
   existence, night would have brooded over the universe notwithstanding
   the other luminaries of heaven; so, had we nor known the Word, and been
   illuminated by Him; we should have been nowise different from fowls
   that are being fed, fattened in darkness, and nourished for death. Let
   us then admit the light, that we may admit God; let us admit the light,
   and become disciples to the Lord. This, too, He has been promised to
   the Father: "I will declare Thy name to my brethren; in the midst of
   the Church will I praise Thee." [1014] Praise and declare to me Thy
   Father God; Thy utterances save; Thy hymn teaches [1015] that hitherto
   I have wandered in error, seeking God. But since Thou leadest me to the
   light, O Lord, and I find God through Thee, and receive the Father from
   Thee, I become "Thy fellow-heir," [1016] since Thou "wert not ashamed
   of me as Thy brother." [1017] Let us put away, then, let us put away
   oblivion of the truth, viz., ignorance; and removing the darkness which
   obstructs, as dimness of sight, let us contemplate the only true God,
   first raising our voice in this hymn of praise: [1018] Hail, O light!
   For in us, buried in darkness, shut up in the shadow of death, light
   has shone forth from heaven, purer than the sun, sweeter than life here
   below. That light is eternal life; and whatever partakes of it lives.
   But night fears the light, and hiding itself in terror, gives place to
   the day of the Lord. Sleepless light is now over all, and the west has
   given credence to the east. For this was the end of the new creation.
   For "the Sun of Righteousness," who drives His chariot over all,
   pervades equally all humanity, like "His Father, who makes His sun to
   rise on all men," and distils on them the dew of the truth. He hath
   changed sunset into sunrise, and through the cross brought death to
   life; and having wrenched man from destruction, He hath raised him to
   the skies, transplanting mortality into immortality, and translating
   earth to heaven--He, the husbandman of God,


   "Pointing out the favourable signs and rousing the nations

   To good works, putting them in mind of the true sustenance;" [1019]

   having bestowed on us the truly great, divine, and inalienable
   inheritance of the Father, deifying man by heavenly teaching, putting
   His laws into our minds, and writing them on our hearts. What laws does
   He inscribe? "That all shall know God, from small to great;" and, "I
   will be merciful to them," says God, "and will not remember their
   sins." [1020] Let us receive the laws of life, let us comply with God's
   expostulations; let us become acquainted with Him, that He may be
   gracious. And though God needs nothing let us render to Him the
   grateful recompense of a thankful heart and of piety, as a kind of
   house-rent for our dwelling here below.


   "Gold for brass,

   A hundred oxen's worth for that of nine;" [1021]

   that is, for your little faith He gives you the earth of so great
   extent to till, water to drink and also to sail on, air to breathe,
   fire to do your work, a world to dwell in; and He has permitted you to
   conduct a colony from here to heaven: with these important works of His
   hand, and benefits in such numbers, He has rewarded your little faith.
   Then, those who have put faith in necromancers, receive from them
   amulets and charms, to ward off evil forsooth; and will you not allow
   the heavenly Word, the Saviour, to be bound on to you as an amulet,
   and, by trusting in God's own charm, be delivered from passions which
   are the diseases of the mind, and rescued from sin?--for sin is eternal
   death. Surely utterly dull and blind, and, like moles, doing nothing
   but eat, you spend your lives in darkness, surrounded with corruption.
   But it is truth which cries, "The light shall shine forth from the
   darkness." Let the light then shine in the hidden part of man, that is,
   the heart; and let the beams of knowledge arise to reveal and irradiate
   the hidden inner man, the disciple of the Light, the familiar friend
   and fellow-heir of Christ; especially now that we have come to know the
   most precious and venerable name of the good Father, who to a pious and
   good child gives gentle counsels, and commands what is salutary for His
   child. He who obeys Him has the advantage in all things, follows God,
   obeys the Father, knows Him through wandering, loves God, loves his
   neighbour, fulfils the commandment, seeks the prize, claims the
   promise. But it has been God's fixed and constant purpose to save the
   flock of men: for this end the good God sent the good Shepherd. And the
   Word, having unfolded the truth, showed to men the height of salvation,
   that either repenting they might be saved, or refusing to obey, they
   might be judged. This is the proclamation of righteousness: to those
   that obey, glad tidings; to those that disobey, judgment. The loud
   trumpet, when sounded, collects the soldiers, and proclaims war. And
   shall not Christ, breathing a strain of peace to the ends of the earth,
   gather together His own soldiers, the soldiers of peace? Well, by His
   blood, and by the word, He has gathered the bloodless host of peace,
   and assigned to them the kingdom of heaven. The trumpet of Christ is
   His Gospel. He hath blown it, and we have heard. "Let us array
   ourselves in the armour of peace, putting on the breastplate of
   righteousness, and taking the shield of faith, and binding our brows
   with the helmet of salvation; and the sword of the Spirit, which is the
   word of God," [1022] let us sharpen. So the apostle in the spirit of
   peace commands. These are our invulnerable weapons: armed with these,
   let us face the evil one; "the fiery darts of the evil one" let us
   quench with the sword-points dipped in water, that, have been baptized
   by the Word, returning grateful thanks for the benefits we have
   received, and honouring God through the Divine Word. "For while thou
   art yet speaking," it is said, "He will say, Behold, I am beside thee."
   [1023] O this holy and blessed power, by which God has fellowship with
   men! Better far, then, is it to become at once the imitator and the
   servant of the best of all beings; for only by holy service will any
   one be able to imitate God, and to serve and worship Him only by
   imitating Him. The heavenly and truly divine love comes to men thus,
   when in the soul itself the spark of true goodness, kindled in the soul
   by the Divine Word, is able to burst forth into flame; and, what is of
   the highest importance, salvation runs parallel with sincere
   willingness--choice and life being, so to speak, yoked together.
   Wherefore this exhortation of the truth alone, like the most faithful
   of our friends, abides with us till our last breath, and is to the
   whole and perfect spirit of the soul the kind attendant on our ascent
   to heaven. What, then, is the exhortation I give you? I urge you to be
   saved. This Christ desires. In one word, He freely bestows life on you.
   And who is He? Briefly learn. The Word of truth, the Word of
   incorruption, that regenerates man by bringing him back to the
   truth--the goad that urges to salvation--He who expels destruction and
   pursues death--He who builds up the temple of God in men, that He may
   cause God to take up His abode in men. Cleanse the temple; and
   pleasures and amusements abandon to the winds and the fire, as a fading
   flower; but wisely cultivate the fruits of self-command, and present
   thyself to God as an offering of first-fruits, that there may be not
   the work alone, but also the grace of God; and both are requisite, that
   the friend of Christ may be rendered worthy of the kingdom, and be
   counted worthy of the kingdom.

      Chapter XII.--Exhortation to Abandon Their Old Errors and Listen to the
      Instructions of Christ.

   Let us then avoid custom as we would a dangerous headland, or the
   threatening Charybdis, or the mythic sirens. It chokes man, turns him
   away from truth, leads him away from life: custom is a snare, a gulf, a
   pit, a mischievous winnowing fan.


   "Urge the ship beyond that smoke and billow." [1024]

   Let us shun, fellow-mariners, let us shun this billow; it vomits forth
   fire: it is a wicked island, heaped with bones and corpses, and in it
   sings a fair courtesan, Pleasure, delighting with music for the common
   ear.


   "Hie thee hither, far-famed Ulysses, great glory of the Achæans;

   Moor the ship, that thou mayest hear diviner voice." [1025]

   She praises thee, O mariner, and calls the illustrious; and the
   courtesan tries to win to herself the glory of the Greeks. Leave her to
   prey on the dead; a heavenly spirit comes to thy help: pass by
   Pleasure, she beguiles.


   "Let not a woman with flowing train cheat you of your senses,

   With her flattering prattle seeking your hurt."

   Sail past the song; it works death. Exert your will only, and you have
   overcome ruin; bound to the wood of the cross, thou shalt be freed from
   destruction: the word of God will be thy pilot, and the Holy Spirit
   will bring thee to anchor in the haven of heaven. Then shalt thou see
   my God, and be initiated into the sacred mysteries, and come to the
   fruition of those things which are laid up in heaven reserved for me,
   which "ear hath not heard, nor have they entered into the heart of
   any." [1026]


   "And in sooth methinks I see two suns,

   And a double Thebes," [1027]

   said one frenzy-stricken in the worship of idols, intoxicated with mere
   ignorance. I would pity him in his frantic intoxication, and thus
   frantic I would invite him to the sobriety of salvation; for the Lord
   welcomes a sinner's repentance, and not his death.

   Come, O madman, not leaning on the thyrsus, not crowned with ivy; throw
   away the mitre, throw away the fawn-skin; come to thy senses. I will
   show thee the Word, and the mysteries of the Word, expounding them
   after thine own fashion. This is the mountain beloved of God, not the
   subject of tragedies like Cithæron, but consecrated to dramas of the
   truth,--a mount of sobriety, shaded with forests of purity; and there
   revel on it not the Mænades, the sisters of Semele, who was struck by
   the thunderbolt, practising in their initiatory rites unholy division
   of flesh, but the daughters of God, the fair lambs, who celebrate the
   holy rites of the Word, raising a sober choral dance. The righteous are
   the chorus; the music is a hymn of the King of the universe. The
   maidens strike the lyre, the angels praise, the prophets speak; the
   sound of music issues forth, they run and pursue the jubilant band;
   those that are called make haste, eagerly desiring to receive the
   Father.

   Come thou also, O aged man, leaving Thebes, and casting away from thee
   both divination and Bacchic frenzy, allow thyself to be led to the
   truth. I give thee the staff [of the cross] on which to lean. Haste,
   Tiresias; believe, and thou wilt see. Christ, by whom the eyes of the
   blind recover sight, will shed on thee a light brighter than the sun;
   night will flee from thee, fire will fear, death will be gone; thou,
   old man, who saw not Thebes, shalt see the heavens. O truly sacred
   mysteries! O stainless light! My way is lighted with torches, and I
   survey the heavens and God; I become holy whilst I am initiated. The
   Lord is the hierophant, and seals while illuminating him who is
   initiated, and presents to the Father him who believes, to be kept safe
   for ever. Such are the reveries of my mysteries. If it is thy wish, be
   thou also initiated; and thou shall join the choir along with angels
   around the unbegotten and indestructible and the only true God, the
   Word of God, raising the hymn with us. [1028] This Jesus, who is
   eternal, the one great High Priest of the one God, and of His Father,
   prays for and exhorts men.

   "Hear, ye myriad tribes, rather whoever among men are endowed with
   reason, both barbarians and Greeks. I call on the whole race of men,
   whose Creator I am, by the will of the Father. Come to Me, that you may
   be put in your due rank under the one God and the one Word of God; and
   do not only have the advantage of the irrational creatures in the
   possession of reason; for to you of all mortals I grant the enjoyment
   of immortality. For I want, I want to impart to you this grace,
   bestowing on you the perfect boon of immortality; and I confer on you
   both the Word and the knowledge of God, My complete self. This am I,
   this God wills, this is symphony, this the harmony of the Father, this
   is the Son, this is Christ, this the Word of God, the arm of the Lord,
   the power of the universe, the will of the Father; of which things
   there were images of old, but not all adequate. I desire to restore you
   according to the original model, that ye may become also like Me. I
   anoint you with the ungent of faith, by which you throw off corruption,
   and show you the naked form of righteousness by which you ascend to
   God. Come to Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek
   and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest to your souls. For My yoke
   is easy, and My burden light." [1029]

   Let us haste, let us run, my fellow-men--us, who are God-loving and
   God-like images of the Word. Let us haste, let us run, let us take His
   yoke, let us receive, to conduct us to immortality, the good charioteer
   of men. Let us love Christ. He led the colt with its parent; and having
   yoked the team of humanity to God, directs His chariot to immortality,
   hastening clearly to fulfil, by driving now into heaven, what He
   shadowed forth before by riding into Jerusalem. A spectacle most
   beautiful to the Father is the eternal Son crowned with victory. [1030]
   Let us aspire, then, after what is good; let us become God-loving men,
   and obtain the greatest of all things which are incapable of being
   harmed--God and life. Our helper is the Word; let us put confidence in
   Him; and never let us be visited with such a craving for silver and
   gold, and glory, as for the Word of truth Himself. For it will not, it
   will not be pleasing to God Himself if we value least those things
   which are worth most, and hold in the highest estimation the manifest
   enormities and the utter impiety of folly, and ignorance, and
   thoughtlessness, and idolatry. For not improperly the sons of the
   philosophers consider that the foolish are guilty of profanity and
   impiety in whatever they do; and describing ignorance itself as a
   species of madness, allege that the multitude are nothing but madmen.
   There is therefore no room to doubt, the Word will say, whether it is
   better to be sane or insane; but holding on to truth with our teeth, we
   must with all our might follow God, and in the exercise of wisdom
   regard all things to be, as they are, His; and besides, having learned
   that we are the most excellent of His possessions, let us commit
   ourselves to God, loving the Lord God, and regarding this as our
   business all our life long. And if what belongs to friends be reckoned
   common property, and man be the friend of God--for through the
   mediation of the Word has he been made the friend of God--then
   accordingly all things become man's, because all things are God's, and
   the common property of both the friends, God and man.

   It is time, then, for us to say that the pious Christian alone is rich
   and wise, and of noble birth, and thus call and believe him to be God's
   image, and also His likeness, [1031] having become righteous and holy
   and wise by Jesus Christ, and so far already like God. Accordingly this
   grace is indicated by the prophet, when he says, "I said that ye are
   gods, and all sons of the Highest." [1032] For us, yea us, He has
   adopted, and wishes to be called the Father of us alone, not of the
   unbelieving. Such is then our position who are the attendants of
   Christ.


   "As are men's wishes, so are their words;

   As are their words, so are their deeds;

   And as their works, such is their life."

   Good is the whole life of those who have known Christ.

   Enough, methinks, of words, though, impelled by love to man, I might
   have gone on to pour out what I had from God, that I might exhort to
   what is the greatest of blessings--salvation. [1033] For discourses
   concerning the life which has no end, are not readily brought to the
   end of their disclosures. To you still remains this conclusion, to
   choose which will profit you most--judgment or grace. For I do not
   think there is even room for doubt which of these is the better; nor is
   it allowable to compare life with destruction.

   affect the minds of those whom they were addressing. It was unnecessary
   for them to establish, by a long train of reasoning, the probability
   that a revelation may be made from heaven to man, or to prove the
   credibility of miracles . . . The majority, both of the learned and
   unlearned, were fixed in the belief that the Deity exercised an
   immediate control over the human race, and consequently felt no
   predisposition to reject that which purported to be a communication of
   His will. . . . Accustomed as they were, however, to regard the various
   systems proposed by philosophers as matters of curious speculation,
   designed to exercise the understanding, not to influence the conduct,
   the chief difficulty of the advocate of Christianity was to prevent
   them from treating it with the same levity, and to induce them to view
   it in its true light as a revelation declaring truths of the highest
   practical importance." This remark of Bishop Kaye is a hint of vast
   importance in our study of the early Apologists. It is taken from that
   author's Account of the Writings of Clement of Alexandria (London,
   1835), to which I would refer the student, as the best introduction to
   these works that I know of. It is full of valuable comment and
   exposition. I make only sparing reference to it, however, in these
   pages, as otherwise I should hardly know what to omit, or to include.]

      Chapter I. The Office of the Instructor.

   As there are these three things in the case of man, habits, actions,
   and passions; habits are the department appropriated by hortatory
   discourse the guide to piety, which, like the ship's keel, is laid
   beneath for the building up of faith; in which, rejoicing exceedingly,
   and abjuring our old opinions, through salvation we renew our youth,
   singing with the hymning prophecy, "How good is God to Israel, to such
   as are upright in heart!" [1034] All actions, again, are the province
   of preceptive discourse; while persuasive discourse applies itself to
   heal the passions. It is, however, one and the self-same word which
   rescues man from the custom of this world in which he has been reared,
   and trains him up in the one salvation of faith in God.

   When, then, the heavenly guide, the Word, was inviting [1035] men to
   salvation, the appellation of hortatory was properly applied to Him:
   his same word was called rousing (the whole from a part). For the whole
   of piety is hortatory, engendering in the kindred faculty of reason a
   yearning after true life now and to come. But now, being at once
   curative and preceptive, following in His own steps, He makes what had
   been prescribed the subject of persuasion, promising the cure of the
   passions within us. Let us then designate this Word appropriately by
   the one name Tutor (or Pædagogue, or Instructor).

   The Instructor being practical, not theoretical, His aim is thus to
   improve the soul, not to teach, and to train it up to a virtuous, not
   to an intellectual life. Although this same word is didactic, but not
   in the present instance. For the word which, in matters of doctrine,
   explains and reveals, is that whose province it is to teach. But our
   Educator [1036] being practical, first exhorts to the attainment of
   right dispositions and character, and then persuades us to the
   energetic practice of our duties, enjoining on us pure commandments,
   and exhibiting to such as come after representations of those who
   formerly wandered in error. Both are of the highest utility,--that
   which assumes the form of counselling to obedience, and that which is
   presented in the form of example; which latter is of two kinds,
   corresponding to the former duality,--the one having for its purpose
   that we should choose and imitate the good, and the other that we
   should reject and turn away from the opposite.

   Hence accordingly ensues the healing of our passions, in consequence of
   the assuagements of those examples; the Pædagogue strengthening our
   souls, and by His benign commands, as by gentle medicines, guiding the
   sick to the perfect knowledge of the truth.

   There is a wide difference between health and knowledge; for the latter
   is produced by learning, the former by healing. One, who is ill, will
   not therefore learn any branch of instruction till he is quite well.
   For neither to learners nor to the sick is each injunction invariably
   expressed similarly; but to the former in such a way as to lead to
   knowledge, and to the latter to health. As, then, for those of us who
   are diseased in body a physician is required, so also those who are
   diseased in soul require a pædagogue to cure our maladies; and then a
   teacher, to train and guide the soul to all requisite knowledge when it
   is made able to admit the revelation of the Word. Eagerly desiring,
   then, to perfect us by a gradation conducive to salvation, suited for
   efficacious discipline, a beautiful arrangement is observed by the
   all-benignant Word, who first exhorts, then trains, and finally
   teaches.

      Chapter II.--Our Instructor's Treatment of Our Sins.

   Now, O you, my children, our Instructor is like His Father God, whose
   son He is, sinless, blameless, and with a soul devoid of passion; God
   in the form of man, stainless, the minister of His Father's will, the
   Word who is God, who is in the Father, who is at the Father's right
   hand, and with the form of God is God. He is to us a spotless image; to
   Him we are to try with all our might to assimilate our souls. He is
   wholly free from human passions; wherefore also He alone is judge,
   because He alone is sinless. As far, however, as we can, let us try to
   sin as little as possible. For nothing is so urgent in the first place
   as deliverance from passions and disorders, and then the checking of
   our liability to fall into sins that have become habitual. It is best,
   therefore, not to sin at all in any way, which we assert to be the
   prerogative of God alone; next to keep clear of voluntary
   transgressions, which is characteristic of the wise man; thirdly, not
   to fall into many involuntary offences, which is peculiar to those who
   have been excellently trained. Not to continue long in sins, let that
   be ranked last. But this also is salutary to those who are called back
   to repentance, to renew the contest.

   And the Instructor, as I think, very beautifully says, through Moses:
   "If any one die suddenly by him, straightway the head of his
   consecration shall be polluted, and shall be shaved," [1037]
   designating involuntary sin as sudden death. And He says that it
   pollutes by defiling the soul: wherefore He prescribes the cure with
   all speed, advising the head to be instantly shaven; that is,
   counselling the locks of ignorance which shade the reason to be shorn
   clean off, that reason (whose seat is in the brain), being left bare of
   the dense stuff of vice, may speed its way to repentance. Then after a
   few remarks He adds, "The days before are not reckoned irrational,"
   [1038] by which manifestly sins are meant which are contrary to reason.
   The involuntary act He calls "sudden," the sin He calls "irrational."
   Wherefore the Word, the Instructor, has taken the charge of us, in
   order to the prevention of sin, which is contrary to reason.

   Hence consider the expression of Scripture, "Therefore these things
   saith the Lord;" the sin that had been committed before is held up to
   reprobation by the succeeding expression "therefore," according to
   which the righteous judgment follows. This is shown conspicuously by
   the prophets, when they said, "Hadst thou not sinned, He would not have
   uttered these threatenings." "Therefore thus saith the Lord;" "Because
   thou hast not heard these words, therefore these things the Lord;" and,
   "Therefore, behold, the Lord saith." For prophecy is given by reason
   both of obedience and disobedience: for obedience, that we may be
   saved; for disobedience, that we may be corrected.

   Our Instructor, the Word, therefore cures the unnatural passions of the
   soul by means of exhortations. For with the highest propriety the help
   of bodily diseases is called the healing art--an art acquired by human
   skill. But the paternal Word is the only Pæonian physician of human
   infirmities, and the holy charmer of the sick soul. "Save," it is said,
   "Thy servant, O my God, who trusteth in Thee. Pity me, O Lord; for I
   will cry to Thee all the day." [1039] For a while the "physician's
   art," according to Democritus, "heals the diseases of the body; wisdom
   frees the soul from passion." But the good Instructor, the Wisdom, the
   Word of the Father, who made man, cares for the whole nature of His
   creature; the all-sufficient Physician of humanity, the Saviour, heals
   both body and soul. "Rise up," He said to the paralytic; "take the bed
   on which thou liest, and go away home;" [1040] and straightway the
   infirm man received strength. And to the dead He said, "Lazarus, go
   forth;" [1041] and the dead man issued from his coffin such as he was
   ere he died, having undergone resurrection. Further, He heals the soul
   itself by precepts and gifts--by precepts indeed, in course of time,
   but being liberal in His gifts, He says to us sinners, "Thy sins be
   forgiven thee." [1042]

   We, however, as soon as He conceived the thought, became His children,
   having had assigned us the best and most secure rank by His orderly
   arrangement, which first circles about the world, the heavens, and the
   sun's circuits, and occupies itself with the motions of the rest of the
   stars for man's behoof, and then busies itself with man himself, on
   whom all its care is concentrated; and regarding him as its greatest
   work, regulated his soul by wisdom and temperance, and tempered the
   body with beauty and proportion. And whatever in human actions is right
   and regular, is the result of the inspiration of its rectitude and
   order.

      Chapter III.--The Philanthropy of the Instructor.

   The Lord ministers all good and all help, both as man and as God: as
   God, forgiving our sins; and as man, training us not to sin. Man is
   therefore justly dear to God, since he is His workmanship. The other
   works of creation He made by the word of command alone, but man He
   framed by Himself, by His own hand, and breathed into him what was
   peculiar to Himself. What, then, was fashioned by Him, and after He
   likeness, either was created by God Himself as being desirable on its
   own account, or was formed as being desirable on account of something
   else. If, then, man is an object desirable for itself, then He who is
   good loved what is good, and the love-charm is within even in man, and
   is that very thing which is called the inspiration [or breath] of God;
   but if man was a desirable object on account of something else, God had
   no other reason for creating him, than that unless he came into being,
   it was not possible for God to be a good Creator, or for man to arrive
   at the knowledge of God. For God would not have accomplished that on
   account of which man was created otherwise than by the creation of man;
   and what hidden power in willing God possessed, He carried fully out by
   the forth-putting of His might externally in the act of creating,
   receiving from man what He made man; [1043] and whom He had He saw, and
   what He wished that came to pass; and there is nothing which God cannot
   do. Man, then, whom God made, is desirable for himself, and that which
   is desirable on his account is allied to him to whom it is desirable on
   his account; and this, too, is acceptable and liked.

   But what is loveable, and is not also loved by Him? And man has been
   proved to be loveable; consequently man is loved by God. For how shall
   he not be loved for whose sake the only-begotten Son is sent from the
   Father's bosom, the Word of faith, the faith which is superabundant;
   the Lord Himself distinctly confessing and saying, "For the Father
   Himself loveth you, because ye have loved Me;" [1044] and again, "And
   hast loved them as Thou hast loved Me?" [1045] What, then, the Master
   desires and declares, and how He is disposed in deed and word, how He
   commands what is to be done, and forbids the opposite, has already been
   shown.

   Plainly, then, the other kind of discourse, the didactic, is powerful
   and spiritual, observing precision, occupied in the contemplation of
   mysteries. But let it stand over for the present. Now, it is incumbent
   on us to return His love, who lovingly guides us to that life which is
   best; and to live in accordance with the injunctions of His will, not
   only fulfilling what is commanded, or guarding against what is
   forbidden, but turning away from some examples, and imitating others as
   much as we can, and thus to perform the works of the Master according
   to His similitude, and so fulfil what Scripture says as to our being
   made in His image and likeness. For, wandering in life as in deep
   darkness, we need a guide that cannot stumble or stray; and our guide
   is the best, not blind, as the Scripture says, "leading the blind into
   pits." [1046] But the Word is keen-sighted, and scans the recesses of
   the heart. As, then, that is not light which enlightens not, nor motion
   that moves not, nor loving which loves not, so neither is that good
   which profits not, nor guides to salvation. Let us then aim at the
   fulfilment of the commandments by the works of the Lord; for the Word
   Himself also, having openly become flesh, [1047] exhibited the same
   virtue, both practical and contemplative. Wherefore let us regard the
   Word as law, and His commands and counsels as the short and straight
   paths to immortality; for His precepts are full of persuasion, not of
   fear.

   [1043] Bishop Kaye (Some Account of the Writings and Opinions of
   Clement of Alexandria, p. 48) translates, "receiving from man that
   which made man (that on account of which man was made)." But it seems
   more likely that Clement refers to the ideal man in the divine mind,
   whom he indentifies elsewhere with the Logos, the anthropos apathes, of
   whom man was the image. The reader will notice that Clement speaks of
   man as existing in the divine mind before his creation, and creation is
   represented by God's seeing what He had previously within Him merely as
   a hidden power.

      Chapter IV.--Men and Women Alike Under the Instructor's Charge.

   Let us, then, embracing more and more this good obedience, give
   ourselves to the Lord; clinging to what is surest, the cable of faith
   in Him, and understanding that the virtue of man and woman is the same.
   For if the God of both is one, the master of both is also one; one
   church, one temperance, one modesty; their food is common, marriage an
   equal yoke; respiration, sight, hearing, knowledge, hope, obedience,
   love all alike. And those whose life is common, have common graces and
   a common salvation; common to them are love and training. "For in this
   world," he says, "they marry, and are given in marriage," [1048] in
   which alone the female is distinguished from the male; "but in that
   world it is so no more." There the rewards of this social and holy
   life, which is based on conjugal union, are laid up, not for male and
   female, but for man, the sexual desire which divides humanity being
   removed. Common therefore, too, to men and women, is the name of man.
   For this reason I think the Attics called, not boys only, but girls,
   paidarion, using it as a word of common gender; if Menander the comic
   poet, in Rhapizomena, appears to any one a sufficient authority, who
   thus speaks:--


   "My little daughter; for by nature

   The child (paidarion) is most loving.

   Arnes, too, the word for lambs, is a common name of simplicity for the
   male and female animal.

   Now the Lord Himself will feed us as His flock forever. Amen. But
   without a sheperd, neither can sheep nor any other animal live, nor
   children without a tutor, nor domestics without a master."

      Chapter V.--All Who Walk According to Truth are Children of God.

   That, then, Pædagogy is the training of children (paidon agoge), is
   clear from the word itself. It remains for us to consider the children
   whom Scripture points to; then to give the pædagogue charge of them. We
   are the children. In many ways Scripture celebrates us, and describes
   us in manifold figures of speech, giving variety to the simplicity of
   the faith by diverse names. Accordingly, in the Gospel, "the Lord,
   standing on the shore, says to the disciples"--they happened to be
   fishing--"and called aloud, Children, have ye any meat?" [1049]
   --addressing those that were already in the position of disciples as
   children. "And they brought to Him," it is said, "children, that He
   might put His hands on them and bless them; and when His disciples
   hindered them, Jesus said, Suffer the children, and forbid them not to
   come to Me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven." [1050] What the
   expression means the Lord Himself shall declare, saying, "Except ye be
   converted, and become as little chidren, ye shall not enter into the
   kingdom of heaven;" [1051] not in that place speaking figuratively of
   regeneration, but setting before us, for our imitation, the simplicity
   that is in children. [1052]

   The prophetic spirit also distinguishes us as children. "Plucking," it
   is said, "branches of olives or palms, the children went forth to meet
   the Lord, and cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He
   that cometh in the name of the Lord;" [1053] light, and glory, and
   praise, with supplication to the Lord: for this is the meaning of the
   expression Hosanna when rendered in Greek. And the Scripture appears to
   me, in allusion to the prophecy just mentioned, reproachfully to
   upbraid the thoughtless: "Have ye never read, Out of the mouths of
   babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise?" [1054] In this way the
   Lord in the Gospels spurs on His disciples, urging them to attend to
   Him, hastening as He was to the Father; rendering His hearers more
   eager by the intimation that after a little He was to depart, and
   showing them that it was requisite that they should take more unsparing
   advantage of the truth than ever before, as the Word was to ascend to
   heaven. Again, therefore, He calls them children; for He says,
   "Children, a little while I am with you." [1055] And, again, He likens
   the kingdom of heaven to children sitting in the market-places and
   saying, "We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have
   mourned, and ye have not lamented;" [1056] and whatever else He added
   agreeably thereto. And it is not alone the Gospel that holds these
   sentiments. Prophecy also agrees with it. David accordingly says,
   "Praise, O children, the Lord; praise the name of the Lord." [1057] It
   says also by Esaias, "Here am I, and the children that God hath given
   me." [1058] Are you amazed, then, to hear that men who belong to the
   nations are sons in the Lord's sight? You do not in that case appear to
   give ear to the Attic dialect, from which you may learn that beautiful,
   comely, and freeborn young maidens are still called paidiskai, and
   servant-girls paidiskaria; and that those last also are, on account of
   the bloom of youth, called by the flattering name of young maidens.

   And when He says, "Let my lambs stand on my right," [1059] He alludes
   to the simple children, as if they were sheep and lambs in nature, not
   men; and the lambs He counts worthy of preference, from the superior
   regard He has to that tenderness and simplicity of disposition in men
   which constitutes innocence. Again, when He says, "as suckling calves,"
   He again alludes figuratively to us; and "as an innocent and gentle
   dove," [1060] the reference is again to us. Again, by Moses, He
   commands "two young pigeons or a pair of turtles to be offered for
   sin;" [1061] thus saying, that the harmlessness and innocence and
   placable nature of these tender young birds are acceptable to God, and
   explaining that like is an expiation for like. Further, the
   timorousness of the turtle-doves typifies fear in reference to sin.

   And that He calls us chickens the Scripture testifies: "As a hen
   gathereth her chickens under her wings." [1062] Thus are we the Lord's
   chickens; the Word thus marvellously and mystically describing the
   simplicity of childhood. For sometimes He calls us children, sometimes
   chickens, sometimes infants, and at other times sons, and "a new
   people," and "a recent people." "And my servants shall be called by a
   new name" [1063] (a new name, He says, fresh and eternal, pure and
   simple, and childlike and true), which shall be blessed on the earth.
   And again, He figuratively calls us colts unyoked to vice, not broken
   in by wickedness; but simple, and bounding joyously to the Father
   alone; not such horses "as neigh after their neighbours' wives, that
   are under the yoke, and are female-mad;" [1064] but free and new-born,
   jubilant by means of faith, ready to run to the truth, swift to speed
   to salvation, that tread and stamp under foot the things of the world.

   "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion; tell aloud, O daughter of
   Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh, just, meek, and bringing salvation;
   meek truly is He, and riding on a beast of burden, and a young colt."
   [1065] It was not enough to have said colt alone, but He added to it
   also young, to show the youth of humanity in Christ, and the eternity
   of simplicity, which shall know no old age. And we who are little ones
   being such colts, are reared up by our divine colt-tamer. But if the
   new man in Scripture is represented by the ass, this ass is also a
   colt. "And he bound," it is said, "the colt to the vine," having bound
   this simple and childlike people to the word, whom He figuratively
   represents as a vine. For the vine produces wine, as the Word produces
   blood, and both drink for health to men--wine for the body, blood for
   the spirit.

   And that He also calls us lambs, the Spirit by the mouth of Isaiah is
   an unimpeachable witness: "He will feed His flock like a shepherd, He
   will gather the lambs with His arm," [1066] --using the figurative
   appellation of lambs, which are still more tender than sheep, to
   express simplicity. And we also in truth, honouring the fairest and
   most perfect objects in life with an appellation derived from the word
   child, have named training paideia, and discipline paidagogia.
   Discipline (paidagogia) we declare to be right guiding from childhood
   to virtue. Accordingly, our Lord revealed more distinctly to us what is
   signified by the appellation of children. On the question arising among
   the apostles, "which of them should be the greater," Jesus placed a
   little child in the midst, saying, "Whosoever, shall humble himself as
   this little child, the same shall be the greater in the kingdom of
   heaven." [1067] He does not then use the appellation of children on
   account of their very limited amount of understanding from their age,
   as some have thought. Nor, if He says, "Except ye become as these
   children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of God," are His words to
   be understood as meaning "without learning." We, then, who are infants,
   no longer roll on the ground, nor creep on the earth like serpents as
   before, crawling with the whole body about senseless lusts; but,
   stretching upwards in soul, loosed from the world and our sins,
   touching the earth on tiptoe so as to appear to be in the world, we
   pursue holy wisdom, although this seems folly to those whose wits are
   whetted for wickedness. Rightly, then, are those called children who
   know Him who is God alone as their Father, who are simple, and infants,
   and guileless, who are lovers of the horns of the unicorns. [1068]

   To those, therefore, that have made progress in the word, He has
   proclaimed this utterance, bidding them dismiss anxious care of the
   things of this world, and exhorting them to adhere to the Father alone,
   in imitation of children. Wherefore also in what follows He says: "Take
   no anxious thought for the morrow; sufficient unto the day is the evil
   thereof." [1069] Thus He enjoins them to lay aside the cares of this
   life, and depend on the Father alone. And he who fulfils this
   commandment is in reality a child and a son to God and to the
   world,--to the one as deceived, to the other as beloved. And if we have
   one Master in heaven, as the Scripture says, then by common consent
   those on the earth will be rightly called disciples. For so is the
   truth, that perfection is with the Lord, who is always teaching, and
   infancy and childishness with us, who are always learning. Thus
   prophecy hath honoured perfection, by applying to it the appellation
   man. For instance, by David, He says of the devil: "The Lord abhors the
   man of blood;" [1070] he calls him man, as perfect in wickedness. And
   the Lord is called man, because He is perfect in righteousness.
   Directly in point is the instance of the apostle, who says, writing the
   Corinthians: "For I have espoused you to one man, that I may present
   you as a chaste virgin to Christ," [1071] whether as children or
   saints, but to the Lord alone. And writing to the Ephesians, he has
   unfolded in the clearest manner the point in question, speaking to the
   following effect: "Till we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of
   the knowledge of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature
   of the fulness of Christ: that we be no longer children, tossed to and
   fro by every wind of doctrine, by the craft of men, by their cunning in
   stratagems of deceit; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up to
   Him in all things," [1072] --saying these things in order to the
   edification of the body of Christ, who is the head and man, the only
   one perfect in righteousness; and we who are children guarding against
   the blasts of heresies, which blow to our inflation; and not putting
   our trust in fathers who teach us otherwise, are then made perfect when
   we are the church, having received Christ the head. Then it is right to
   notice, with respect to the appellation of infant (nepios), that to
   nepion is not predicated of the silly: for the silly man is called
   neputios: and nepios is neepios (since he that is tender-hearted is
   called epios), as being one that has newly become gentle and meek in
   conduct. This the blessed Paul most clearly pointed out when he said,
   "When we might have been burdensome as the apostles of Christ, we were
   gentle (epioi) among you, as a nurse cherisheth her children." [1073]
   The child (nepios) is therefore gentle (epios), and therefore more
   tender, delicate, and simple, guileless, and destitute of hypocrisy,
   straightforward and upright in mind, which is the basis of simplicity
   and truth. For He says, "Upon whom shall I look, but upon him who is
   gentle and quiet?" [1074] For such is the virgin speech, tender, and
   free of fraud; whence also a virgin is wont to be called "a tender
   bride," and a child "tender-hearted." And we are tender who are pliant
   to the power of persuasion, and are easily drawn to goodness, and are
   mild, and free of the stain of malice and perverseness, for the ancient
   race was perverse and hard-hearted; but the band of infants, the new
   people which we are, is delicate as a child. On account of the hearts
   of the innocent, the apostle, in the Epistle to the Romans, owns that
   he rejoices, and furnishes a kind of definition of children, so to
   speak, when he says, "I would have you wise toward good, but simple
   towards evil." [1075] For the name of child, nepios, is not understood
   by us privatively, though the sons of the grammarians make the ne a
   privative particle. For if they call us who follow after childhood
   foolish, see how they utter blasphemy against the Lord, in regarding
   those as foolish who have betaken themselves to God. But if, which is
   rather the true sense, they themselves understand the designation
   children of simple ones, we glory in the name. For the new minds, which
   have newly become wise, which have sprung into being according to the
   new covenant, are infantile in the old folly. Of late, then, God was
   known by the coming of Christ: "For no man knoweth God but the Son, and
   he to whom the Son shall reveal Him." [1076]

   In contradistinction, therefore, to the older people, the new people
   are called young, having learned the new blessings; and we have the
   exuberance of life's morning prime in this youth which knows no old
   age, in which we are always growing to maturity in intelligence, are
   always young, always mild, always new: for those must necessarily be
   new, who have become partakers of the new Word. And that which
   participates in eternity is wont to be assimilated to the
   incorruptible: so that to us appertains the designation of the age of
   childhood, a lifelong spring-time, because the truth that is in us, and
   our habits saturated with the truth, cannot be touched by old age; but
   Wisdom is ever blooming, ever remains consistent and the same, and
   never changes. "Their children," it is said, "shall be borne upon their
   shoulders, and fondled on their knees; as one whom his mother
   comforteth, so also shall I comfort you." [1077] The mother draws the
   children to herself; and we seek our mother the Church. Whatever is
   feeble and tender, as needing help on account of its feebleness, is
   kindly looked on, and is sweet and pleasant, anger changing into help
   in the case of such: for thus horses' colts, and the little calves of
   cows, and the lion's whelp, and the stag's fawn, and the child of man,
   are looked upon with pleasure by their fathers and mothers. Thus also
   the Father of the universe cherishes affection towards those who have
   fled to Him; and having begotten them again by His Spirit to the
   adoption of children, knows them as gentle, and loves those alone, and
   aids and fights for them; and therefore He bestows on them the name of
   child. The word Isaac I also connect with child. Isaac means laughter.
   He was seen sporting with his wife and helpmeet Rebecca by the prying
   king. [1078] The king, whose name was Abimelech, appears to me to
   represent a supramundane wisdom contemplating the mystery of sport.
   They interpret Rebecca to mean endurance. O wise sport, laughter also
   assisted by endurance, and the king as spectator! The spirit of those
   that are children in Christ, whose lives are ordered in endurance,
   rejoice. And this is the divine sport. "Such a sport, of his own, Jove
   sports," says Heraclitus. For what other employment is seemly for a
   wise and perfect man, than to sport and be glad in the endurance of
   what is good--and, in the administration of what is good, holding
   festival with God? That which is signified by the prophet may be
   interpreted differently,--namely, of our rejoicing for salvation, as
   Isaac. He also, delivered from death, laughed, sporting and rejoicing
   with his spouse, who was the type of the Helper of our salvation, the
   Church, to whom the stable name of endurance is given; for this cause
   surely, because she alone remains to all generations, rejoicing ever,
   subsisting as she does by the endurance of us believers, who are the
   members of Christ. And the witness of those that have endured to the
   end, and the rejoicing on their account, is the mystic sport, and the
   salvation accompanied with decorous solace which brings us aid.

   The King, then, who is Christ, beholds from above our laughter, and
   looking through the window, as the Scripture says, views the
   thanksgiving, and the blessing, and the rejoicing, and the gladness,
   and furthermore the endurance which works together with them and their
   embrace: views His Church, showing only His face, which was wanting to
   the Church, which is made perfect by her royal Head. And where, then,
   was the door by which the Lord showed Himself? The flesh by which He
   was manifested. He is Isaac (for the narrative may be interpreted
   otherwise), who is a type of the Lord, a child as a son; for he was the
   son of Abraham, as Christ the Son of God, and a sacrifice as the Lord,
   but he was not immolated as the Lord. Isaac only bore the wood of the
   sacrifice, as the Lord the wood of the cross. And he laughed
   mystically, prophesying that the Lord should fill us with joy, who have
   been redeemed from corruption by the blood of the Lord. Isaac did
   everything but suffer, as was right, yielding the precedence in
   suffering to the Word. Furthermore, there is an intimation of the
   divinity of the Lord in His not being slain. For Jesus rose again after
   His burial, having suffered no harm, like Isaac released from
   sacrifice. And in defence of the point to be established, I shall
   adduce another consideration of the greatest weight. The Spirit calls
   the Lord Himself a child, thus prophesying by Esaias: "Lo, to us a
   child has been born, to us a son has been given, on whose own shoulder
   the government shall be; and His name has been called the Angel of
   great Counsel." Who, then, is this infant child? He according to whose
   image we are made little children. By the same prophet is declared His
   greatness: "Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
   Prince of Peace; that He might fulfil His discipline: and of His peace
   there shall be no end." [1079] O the great God! O the perfect child!
   The Son in the Father, and the Father in the Son. And how shall not the
   discipline of this child be perfect, which extends to all, leading as a
   schoolmaster us as children who are His little ones? He has stretched
   forth to us those hands of His that are conspicuously worthy of trust.
   To this child additional testimony is borne by John, "the greatest
   prophet among those born of women:" [1080] Behold the Lamb of God!"
   [1081] For since Scripture calls the infant children lambs, it has also
   called Him--God the Word--who became man for our sakes, and who wished
   in all points to be made like to us--"the Lamb of God"--Him, namely,
   that is the Son of God, the child of the Father.

      Chapter VI.--The Name Children Does Not Imply Instruction in Elementary
      Principles.

   We have ample means of encountering those who are given to carping. For
   we are not termed children and infants with reference to the childish
   and contemptible character of our education, as those who are inflated
   on account of knowledge have calumniously alleged. Straightway, on our
   regeneration, we attained that perfection after which we aspired. For
   we were illuminated, which is to know God. He is not then imperfect who
   knows what is perfect. And do not reprehend me when I profess to know
   God; for so it was deemed right to speak to the Word, and He is free.
   [1082] For at the moment of the Lord's baptism there sounded a voice
   from heaven, as a testimony to the Beloved, "Thou art My beloved Son,
   to-day have I begotten Thee." Let us then ask the wise, Is Christ,
   begotten to-day, already perfect, or--what were most
   monstrous--imperfect? If the latter, there is some addition He requires
   yet to make. But for Him to make any addition to His knowledge is
   absurd, since He is God. For none can be superior to the Word, or the
   teacher of the only Teacher. Will they not then own, though reluctant,
   that the perfect Word born of the perfect Father was begotten in
   perfection, according to oeconomic fore-ordination? And if He was
   perfect, why was He, the perfect one, baptized? It was necessary, they
   say, to fulfil the profession that pertained to humanity. Most
   excellent. Well, I assert, simultaneously with His baptism by John, He
   becomes perfect? Manifestly. He did not then learn anything more from
   him? Certainly not. But He is perfected by the washing--of
   baptism--alone, and is sanctified by the descent of the Spirit? Such is
   the case. The same also takes place in our case, whose exemplar Christ
   became. Being baptized, we are illuminated; illuminated, we become
   sons; being made sons, we are made perfect; being made perfect, we are
   made immortal. "I," says He, "have said that ye are gods, and all sons
   of the Highest." [1083] This work is variously called grace, [1084] and
   illumination, and perfection, and washing: washing, by which we cleanse
   away our sins; grace, by which the penalties accruing to transgressions
   are remitted; and illumination, by which that holy light of salvation
   is beheld, that is, by which we see God clearly. Now we call that
   perfect which wants nothing. For what is yet wanting to him who knows
   God? For it were truly monstrous that that which is not complete should
   be called a gift (or act) of God's grace. Being perfect, He
   consequently bestows perfect gifts. As at His command all things were
   made, so on His bare wishing to bestow grace, ensues the perfecting of
   His grace. For the future of time is anticipated by the power of His
   volition.

   Further release from evils is the beginning of salvation. We then
   alone, who first have touched the confines of life, are already
   perfect; and we already live who are separated from death. Salvation,
   accordingly, is the following of Christ: "For that which is in Him is
   life. [1085] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My words,
   and believeth on Him that sent Me, hath eternal life, and cometh not
   into condemnation, but hath passed from death to life." [1086] Thus
   believing alone, and regeneration, is perfection in life; for God is
   never weak. For as His will is work, and this [1087] is named the
   world; so also His counsel is the salvation of men, and this has been
   called the church. He knows, therefore, whom He has called, and whom He
   has saved; and at one and the same time He called and saved them. "For
   ye are," says the apostle, "taught of God." [1088] It is not then
   allowable to think of what is taught by Him as imperfect; and what is
   learned from Him is the eternal salvation of the eternal Saviour, to
   whom be thanks for ever and ever. Amen. And he who is only
   regenerated--as the name necessarily indicates--and is enlightened, is
   delivered forthwith from darkness, and on the instant receives the
   light.

   As, then, those who have shaken off sleep forthwith become all awake
   within; or rather, as those who try to remove a film that is over the
   eyes, do not supply to them from without the light which they do not
   possess, but removing the obstacle from the eyes, leave the pupil free;
   thus also we who are baptized, having wiped off the sins which obscure
   the light of the Divine Spirit, have the eye of the spirit free,
   unimpeded, and full of light, by which alone we contemplate the Divine,
   the Holy Spirit flowing down to us from above. This is the eternal
   adjustment of the vision, which is able to see the eternal light, since
   like loves like; and that which is holy, loves that from which holiness
   proceeds, which has appropriately been termed light. "Once ye were
   darkness, now are ye light in the Lord." [1089] Hence I am of opinion
   man was called by the ancients phos. [1090] But he has not yet
   received, say they, the perfect gift. I also assent to this; but he is
   in the light, and the darkness comprehendeth him not. There is nothing
   intermediate between light and darkness. But the end is reserved till
   the resurrection of those who believe; and it is not the reception of
   some other thing, but the obtaining of the promise previously made. For
   we do not say that both take place together at the same time--both the
   arrival at the end, and the anticipation of that arrival. For eternity
   and time are not the same, neither is the attempt and the final result;
   but both have reference to the same thing, and one and the same person
   is concerned in both. Faith, so to speak, is the attempt generated in
   time; the final result is the attainment of the promise, secured for
   eternity. Now the Lord Himself has most clearly revealed the equality
   of salvation, when He said: "For this is the will of my Father, that
   every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, should have
   everlasting life; and I will raise him up in the last day." [1091] As
   far as possible in this world, which is what he means by the last day,
   and which is preserved till the time that it shall end, we believe that
   we are made perfect. Wherefore He says, "He that believeth on the Son
   hath everlasting life." [1092] If, then, those who have believed have
   life, what remains beyond the possession of eternal life? Nothing is
   wanting to faith, as it is perfect and complete in itself. If aught is
   wanting to it, it is not wholly perfect. But faith is not lame in any
   respect; nor after our departure from this world does it make us who
   have believed, and received without distinction the earnest of future
   good, wait; but having in anticipation grasped by faith that which is
   future, after the resurrection we receive it as present, in order that
   that may be fulfilled which was spoken, "Be it according to thy faith."
   [1093] And where faith is, there is the promise; and the consummation
   of the promise is rest. So that in illumination what we receive is
   knowledge, and the end of knowledge is rest--the last thing conceived
   as the object of aspiration. As, then, inexperience comes to an end by
   experience, and perplexity by finding a clear outlet, so by
   illumination must darkness disappear. The darkness is ignorance,
   through which we fall into sins, purblind as to the truth. Knowledge,
   then, is the illumination we receive, which makes ignorance disappear,
   and endows us with clear vision. Further, the abandonment of what is
   bad is the adopting [1094] of what is better. For what ignorance has
   bound ill, is by knowledge loosed well; those bonds are with all speed
   slackened by human faith and divine grace, our transgressions being
   taken away by one Poeonian [1095] medicine, the baptism of the Word. We
   are washed from all our sins, and are no longer entangled in evil. This
   is the one grace of illumination, that our characters are not the same
   as before our washing. And since knowledge springs up with
   illumination, shedding its beams around the mind, the moment we hear,
   we who were untaught become disciples. Does this, I ask, take place on
   the advent of this instruction? You cannot tell the time. For
   instruction leads to faith, and faith with baptism is trained by the
   Holy Spirit. For that faith is the one universal salvation of humanity,
   and that there is the same equality before the righteous and loving
   God, and the same fellowship between Him and all, the apostle most
   clearly showed, speaking to the following effect: "Before faith came,
   we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should
   afterwards be revealed, so that the law became our schoolmaster to
   bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith; but after that
   faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster." [1096] Do you
   not hear that we are no longer under that law which was accompanied
   with fear, but under the Word, the master of free choice? Then he
   subjoined the utterance, clear of all partiality: "For ye are all the
   children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many as were
   baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor
   Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor
   female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus." [1097] There are not,
   then, in the same Word some "illuminated (gnostics); and some animal
   (or natural) men;" but all who have abandoned the desires of the flesh
   are equal and spiritual before the Lord. And again he writes in another
   place: "For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether
   Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free, and we have all drunk of one
   cup." [1098] Nor were it absurd to employ the expressions of those who
   call the reminiscence of better things the filtration of the spirit,
   understanding by filtration the separation of what is baser, that
   results from the reminiscence of what is better. There follows of
   necessity, in him who has come to the recollection of what is better,
   repentance for what is worse. Accordingly, they confess that the spirit
   in repentance retraces its steps. In the same way, therefore, we also,
   repenting of our sins, renouncing our iniquities, purified by baptism,
   speed back to the eternal light, children to the Father. Jesus
   therefore, rejoicing in the spirit, said: "I thank Thee, O Father, God
   of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and
   prudent, and hast revealed them to babes;" [1099] the Master and
   Teacher applying the name babes to us, who are readier to embrace
   salvation than the wise in the world, who, thinking themselves wise,
   are inflated with pride. And He exclaims in exultation and exceeding
   joy, as if lisping with the children, "Even so, Father; for so it
   seemed good in Thy sight." [1100] Wherefore those things which have
   been concealed from the wise and prudent of this present world have
   been revealed to babes. Truly, then, are we the children of God, who
   have put aside the old man, and stripped off the garment of wickedness,
   and put on the immortality of Christ; that we may become a new, holy
   people by regeneration, and may keep the man undefiled. And a babe, as
   God's little one, [1101] is cleansed from fornication and wickedness.
   With the greatest clearness the blessed Paul has solved for us this
   question in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, writing thus:
   "Brethren, be not children in understanding; howbeit in malice be
   children, but in understanding be men." [1102] And the expression,
   "When I was a child, I thought as a child, I spake as a child," [1103]
   points out his mode of life according to the law, according to which,
   thinking childish things, he persecuted, and speaking childish things
   he blasphemed the Word, not as having yet attained to the simplicity of
   childhood, but as being in its folly; for the word nepion has two
   meanings. [1104] "When I became a man," again Paul says, "I put away
   childish things." [1105] It is not incomplete size of stature, nor a
   definite measure of time, nor additional secret teachings in things
   that are manly and more perfect, that the apostle, who himself
   professes to be a preacher of childishness, alludes to when he sends
   it, as it were, into banishment; but he applies the name "children" to
   those who are under the law, who are terrified by fear as children are
   by bugbears; and "men" to us who are obedient to the Word and masters
   of ourselves, who have believed, and are saved by voluntary choice, and
   are rationally, not irrationally, frightened by terror. Of this the
   apostle himself shall testify, calling as he does the Jews heirs
   according to the first covenant, and us heirs according to promise:
   "Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a
   servant, though he be lord of all; but is under tutors and governors,
   till the time appointed by the father. So also we, when we were
   children, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world: but when
   the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, made of a
   woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that
   we might receive the adoption of sons" [1106] by Him. See how He has
   admitted those to be children who are under fear and sins; but has
   conferred manhood on those who are under faith, by calling them sons,
   in contradistinction from the children that are under the law: "For
   thou art no more a servant," he says, "but a son; and if a son, then an
   heir through God." [1107] What, then, is lacking to the son after
   inheritance? Wherefore the expression, "When I was a child," may be
   elegantly expounded thus: that is, when I was a Jew (for he was a
   Hebrew by extraction) I thought as a child, when I followed the law;
   but after becoming a man, I no longer entertain the sentiments of a
   child, that is, of the law, but of a man, that is, of Christ, whom
   alone the Scripture calls man, as we have said before. "I put away
   childish things." But the childhood which is in Christ is maturity, as
   compared with the law. Having reached this point, we must defend our
   childhood. And we have still to explain what is said by the apostle: "I
   have fed you with milk (as children in Christ), not with meat; for ye
   were not able, neither yet are ye now able." [1108] For it does not
   appear to me that the expression is to be taken in a Jewish sense; for
   I shall oppose to it also that Scripture, "I will bring you into that
   good land which flows with milk and honey." [1109] A very great
   difficulty arises in reference to the comparison of these Scriptures,
   when we consider. For if the infancy which is characterized by the milk
   is the beginning of faith in Christ, then it is disparaged as childish
   and imperfect. How is the rest that comes after the meat, the rest of
   the man who is perfect and endowed with knowledge, again distinguished
   by infant milk? Does not this, as explaining a parable, mean something
   like this, and is not the expression to be read somewhat to the
   following effect: "I have fed you with milk in Christ;" and after a
   slight stop, let us add, "as children," that by separating the words in
   reading we may make out some such sense as this: I have instructed you
   in Christ with simple, true, and natural nourishment,--namely, that
   which is spiritual: for such is the nourishing substance of milk
   swelling out from breasts of love. So that the whole matter may be
   conceived thus: As nurses nourish new-born children on milk, so do I
   also by the Word, the milk of Christ, instilling into you spiritual
   nutriment.

   Thus, then, the milk which is perfect is perfect nourishment, and
   brings to that consummation which cannot cease. Wherefore also the same
   milk and honey were promised in the rest. Rightly, therefore, the Lord
   again promises milk to the righteous, that the Word may be clearly
   shown to be both, "the Alpha and Omega, beginning and end;" [1110] the
   Word being figuratively represented as milk. Something like this Homer
   oracularly declares against his will, when he calls righteous men
   milk-fed (galaktophagoi). [1111] So also may we take the Scripture:
   "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as
   unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ;" [1112] so that the carnal
   may be understood as those recently instructed, and still babes in
   Christ. For he called those who had already believed on the Holy Spirit
   spiritual, and those newly instructed and not yet purified carnal; whom
   with justice he calls still carnal, as minding equally with the heathen
   the things of the flesh: "For whereas there is among you envy and
   strife, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?" [1113] "Wherefore also I
   have given you milk to drink," he says; meaning, I have instilled into
   you the knowledge which, from instruction, nourishes up to life
   eternal. But the expression, "I have given you to drink" (epotisa), is
   the symbol of perfect appropriation. For those who are full-grown are
   said to drink, babes to suck. "For my blood," says the Lord, "is true
   drink." [1114] In saying, therefore, "I have given you milk to drink,"
   has he not indicated the knowledge of the truth, the perfect gladness
   in the Word, who is the milk? And what follows next, "not meat, for ye
   were not able," may indicate the clear revelation in the future world,
   like food, face to face. "For now we see as through a glass," the same
   apostle says, "but then face to face." [1115] Wherefore also he has
   added, "neither yet are ye now able, for ye are still carnal," minding
   the things of the flesh,--desiring, loving, feeling jealousy, wrath,
   envy. "For we are no more in the flesh," [1116] as some suppose. For
   with it [they say], having the face which is like an angel's, we shall
   see the promise face to face. How then, if that is truly the promise
   after our departure hence, say they that they know "what eye hath not
   known, nor hath entered into the mind of man," who have not perceived
   by the Spirit, but received from instruction "what ear hath not heard,"
   [1117] or that ear alone which "was rapt up into the third heaven?"
   [1118] But it even then was commanded to preserve it unspoken.

   But if human wisdom, as it remains to understand, is the glorying in
   knowledge, hear the law of Scripture: "Let not the wise man glory in
   his wisdom, and let not the mighty man glory in his might; but let him
   that glorieth glory in the Lord." [1119] But we are God-taught, and
   glory in the name of Christ. How then are we not to regard the apostle
   as attaching this sense to the milk of the babes? And if we who preside
   over the Churches are shepherds after the image of the good Shepherd,
   and you the sheep, are we not to regard the Lord as preserving
   consistency in the use of figurative speech, when He speaks also of the
   milk of the flock? And to this meaning we may secondly accommodate the
   expression, "I have given you milk to drink, and not given you food,
   for ye are not yet able," regarding the meat not as something different
   from the milk, but the same in substance. For the very same Word is
   fluid and mild as milk, or solid and compact as meat. And entertaining
   this view, we may regard the proclamation of the Gospel, which is
   universally diffused, as milk; and as meat, faith, which from
   instruction is compacted into a foundation, which, being more
   substantial than hearing, is likened to meat, and assimilates to the
   soul itself nourishment of this kind. Elsewhere the Lord, in the Gospel
   according to John, brought this out by symbols, when He said: "Eat ye
   my flesh, and drink my blood;" [1120] describing distinctly by metaphor
   the drinkable properties of faith and the promise, by means of which
   the Church, like a human being consisting of many members, is refreshed
   and grows, is welded together and compacted of both,--of faith, which
   is the body, and of hope, which is the soul; as also the Lord of flesh
   and blood. For in reality the blood of faith is hope, in which faith is
   held as by a vital principle. And when hope expires, it is as if blood
   flowed forth; and the vitality of faith is destroyed. If, then, some
   would oppose, saying that by milk is meant the first lessons--as it
   were, the first food--and that by meat is meant those spiritual
   cognitions to which they attain by raising themselves to knowledge, let
   them understand that, in saying that meat is solid food, and the flesh
   and blood of Jesus, they are brought by their own vainglorious wisdom
   to the true simplicity. For the blood is found to be an original
   product in man, and some have consequently ventured to call it the
   substance of the soul. And this blood, transmuted by a natural process
   of assimilation in the pregnancy of the mother, through the sympathy of
   parental affection, effloresces and grows old, in order that there may
   be no fear for the child. Blood, too, is the moister part of flesh,
   being a kind of liquid flesh; and milk is the sweeter and finer part of
   blood. For whether it be the blood supplied to the foetus, and sent
   through the navel of the mother, or whether it be the menses themselves
   shut out from their proper passage, and by a natural diffusion, bidden
   by the all-nourishing and creating God, proceed to the already swelling
   breasts, and by the heat of the spirits transmuted, [whether it be the
   one or the other] that is formed into food desirable for the babe, that
   which is changed is the blood. For of all the members, the breasts have
   the most sympathy with the womb. When there is parturition, the vessel
   by which blood was conveyed to the foetus is cut off: there is an
   obstruction of the flow, and the blood receives an impulse towards the
   breasts; and on a considerable rush taking place, they are distended,
   and change the blood to milk in a manner analogous to the change of
   blood into pus in ulceration. Or if, on the other hand, the blood from
   the veins in the vicinity of the breasts, which have been opened in
   pregnancy, is poured into the natural hollows of the breasts; and the
   spirit discharged from the neighbouring arteries being mixed with it,
   the substance of the blood, still remaining pure, it becomes white by
   being agitated like a wave; and by an interruption such as this is
   changed by frothing it, like what takes place with the sea, which at
   the assaults of the winds, the poets say, "spits forth briny foam." Yet
   still the essence is supplied by the blood.

   In this way also the rivers, borne on with rushing motion, and fretted
   by contact with the surrounding air, murmur forth foam. The moisture in
   our mouth, too, is whitened by the breath. What an absurdity [1121] is
   it, then, not to acknowledge that the blood is converted into that very
   bright and white substance by the breath! The change it suffers is in
   quality, not in essence. You will certainly find nothing else more
   nourishing, or sweeter, or whiter than milk. In every respect,
   accordingly, it is like spiritual nourishment, which is sweet through
   grace, nourishing as life, bright as the day of Christ.

   The blood of the Word has been also exhibited as milk. Milk being thus
   provided in parturition, is supplied to the infant; and the breasts,
   which till then looked straight towards the husband, now bend down
   towards the child, being taught to furnish the substance elaborated by
   nature in a way easily received for salutary nourishment. For the
   breasts are not like fountains full of milk, flowing in ready prepared;
   but, by effecting a change in the nutriment, form the milk in
   themselves, and discharge it. And the nutriment suitable and wholesome
   for the new-formed and new-born babe is elaborated by God, the
   nourisher and the Father of all that are generated and regenerated,--as
   manna, the celestial food of angels, flowed down from heaven on the
   ancient Hebrews. Even now, in fact, nurses call the first-poured drink
   of milk by the same name as that food--manna. Further, pregnant women,
   on becoming mothers, discharge milk. But the Lord Christ, the fruit of
   the Virgin, did not pronounce the breasts of women blessed, nor
   selected them to give nourishment; but when the kind and loving Father
   had rained down the Word, Himself became spiritual nourishment to the
   good. O mystic marvel! The universal Father is one, and one the
   universal Word; and the Holy Spirit is one and the same everywhere, and
   one is the only virgin mother. I love to call her the Church. This
   mother, when alone, had not milk, because alone she was not a woman.
   But she is once virgin and mother--pure as a virgin, loving as a
   mother. And calling her children to her, she nurses them with holy
   milk, viz., with the Word for childhood. Therefore she had not milk;
   for the milk was this child fair and comely, the body of Christ, which
   nourishes by the Word the young brood, which the Lord Himself brought
   forth in throes of the flesh, which the Lord Himself swathed in His
   precious blood. O amazing birth! O holy swaddling bands! The Word is
   all to the child, both father and mother and tutor and nurse. "Eat ye
   my flesh," He says, "and drink my blood." [1122] Such is the suitable
   food which the Lord ministers, and He offers His flesh and pours forth
   His blood, and nothing is wanting for the children's growth. O amazing
   mystery! We are enjoined to cast off the old and carnal corruption, as
   also the old nutriment, receiving in exchange another new regimen, that
   of Christ, receiving Him if we can, to hide Him within; and that,
   enshrining the Saviour in our souls, we may correct the affections of
   our flesh.

   But you are not inclined to understand it thus, but perchance more
   generally. Hear it also in the following way. The flesh figuratively
   represents to us the Holy Spirit; for the flesh was created by Him. The
   blood points out to us the Word, for as rich blood the Word has been
   infused into life; and the union of both is the Lord, the food of the
   babes--the Lord who is Spirit and Word. The food--that is, the Lord
   Jesus--that is, the Word of God, the Spirit made flesh, the heavenly
   flesh sanctified. The nutriment is the milk of the Father, by which
   alone we infants are nourished. The Word Himself, then, the beloved
   One, and our nourisher, hath shed His own blood for us, to save
   humanity; and by Him, we, believing on God, flee to the Word, "the
   care-soothing breast" of the Father. And He alone, as is befitting,
   supplies us children with the milk of love, and those only are truly
   blessed who suck this breast. Wherefore also Peter says: "Laying
   therefore aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisy, and envy, and
   evil speaking, as new-born babes, desire the milk of the word, that ye
   may grow by it to salvation; if ye have tasted that the Lord is
   Christ." [1123] And were one to concede to them that the meat was
   something different from the milk, then how shall they avoid being
   transfixed on their own spit, through want of consideration of nature?
   [1124] For in winter, when the air is condensed, and prevents the
   escape of the heat enclosed within, the food, transmuted and digested
   and changed into blood, passes into the veins, and these, in the
   absence of exhalation, are greatly distended, and exhibit strong
   pulsations; consequently also nurses are then fullest of milk. And we
   have shown a little above, that on pregnancy blood passes into milk by
   a change which does not affect its substance, just as in old people
   yellow hair changes to grey. But again in summer, the body, having its
   pores more open, affords greater facility for diaphoretic action in the
   case of the food, and the milk is least abundant, since neither is the
   blood full, nor is the whole nutriment retained. If, then, the
   digestion of the food results in the production of blood, and the blood
   becomes milk, then blood is a preparation for milk, as blood is for a
   human beings, and the grape for the vine. With milk, then, the Lord's
   nutriment, we are nursed directly we are born; and as soon as we are
   regenerated, we are honoured by receiving the good news of the hope of
   rest, even the Jerusalem above, in which it is written that milk and
   honey fall in showers, receiving through what is material the pledge of
   the sacred food. "For meats are done away with," [1125] as the apostle
   himself says; but this nourishment on milk leads to the heavens,
   rearing up citizens of heaven, and members of the angelic choirs. And
   since the Word is the gushing fountain of life, and has been called a
   river of olive oil, Paul, using appropriate figurative language, and
   calling Him milk, adds: "I have given you to drink;" [1126] for we
   drink in the word, the nutriment of the truth. In truth, also liquid
   food is called drink; and the same thing may somehow be both meat and
   drink, according to the different aspects in which it is considered,
   just as cheese is the solidification of milk or milk solidified; for I
   am not concerned here to make a nice selection of an expression, only
   to say that one substance supplies both articles of food. Besides, for
   children at the breast, milk alone suffices; it serves both for meat
   and drink. "I," says the Lord, "have meat to eat that ye know not of.
   My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me." [1127] You see another
   kind of food which, similarly with milk, represents figuratively the
   will of God. Besides, also, the completion of His own passion He called
   catachrestically "a cup," [1128] when He alone had to drink and drain
   it. Thus to Christ the fulfilling of His Father's will was food; and to
   us infants, who drink the milk of the word of the heavens, Christ
   Himself is food. Hence seeking is called sucking; for to those babes
   that seek the Word, the Father's breasts of love supply milk.

   Further, the Word declares Himself to be the bread of heaven. "For
   Moses," He says, "gave you not that bread from heaven, but My Father
   giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is He that
   cometh down from heaven, and giveth life to the world. And the bread
   which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the
   world." [1129] Here is to be noted the mystery of the bread, inasmuch
   as He speaks of it as flesh, and as flesh, consequently, that has risen
   through fire, as the wheat springs up from decay and germination; and,
   in truth, it has risen through fire for the joy of the Church, as bread
   baked. But this will be shown by and by more clearly in the chapter on
   the resurrection. But since He said, "And the bread which I will give
   is My flesh," and since flesh is moistened with blood, and blood is
   figuratively termed wine, we are bidden to know that, as bread,
   crumbled into a mixture of wine and water, seizes on the wine and
   leaves the watery portion, so also the flesh of Christ, the bread of
   heaven absorbs the blood; that is, those among men who are heavenly,
   nourishing them up to immortality, and leaving only to destruction the
   lusts of the flesh.

   Thus in many ways the Word is figuratively described, as meat, and
   flesh, and food, and bread, and blood, and milk. The Lord is all these,
   to give enjoyment to us who have believed on Him. Let no one then think
   it strange, when we say that the Lord's blood is figuratively
   represented as milk. For is it not figuratively represented as wine?
   "Who washes," it is said, "His garment in wine, His robe in the blood
   of the grape." [1130] In His own Spirit He says He will deck the body
   of the Word; as certainly by His own Spirit He will nourish those who
   hunger for the Word.

   And that the blood is the Word, is testified by the blood of Abel,
   [1131] the righteous interceding with God. For the blood would never
   have uttered a voice, had it not been regarded as the Word: for the
   righteous man of old is the type of the new righteous one; and the
   blood of old that interceded, intercedes in the place of the new blood.
   And the blood that is the Word cries to God, since it intimated that
   the Word was to suffer.

   Further, this flesh, and the blood in it, are by a mutual sympathy
   moistened and increased by the milk. And the process of formation of
   the seed in conception ensues when it has mingled with the pure residue
   of the menses, which remains. For the force that is in the seed
   coagulating the substances of the blood, as the rennet curdles milk,
   effects the essential part of the formative process. For a suitable
   blending conduces to fruitfulness; but extremes are adverse, and tend
   to sterility. For when the earth itself is flooded by excessive rain,
   the seed is swept away, while in consequence of scarcity it is dried
   up; but when the sap is viscous, it retains the seed, and makes it
   germinate. Some also hold the hypothesis, that the seed of an animal is
   in substance the foam of the blood, which being by the natural heat of
   the male agitated and shaken out is turned into foam, and deposited in
   the seminal veins. For Diogenes Apollionates will have it, that hence
   is derived the word aphrodisia. [1132]

   From all this it is therefore evident, that the essential principle of
   the human body is blood. The contents of the stomach, too, at first are
   milky, a coagulation of fluid; then the same coagulated substance is
   changed into blood; but when it is formed into a compact consistency in
   the womb, by the natural and warm spirit by which the embryo is
   fashioned, it becomes a living creature. Further also, the child after
   birth is nourished by the same blood. For the flow of milk is the
   product of the blood; and the source of nourishment is the milk; by
   which a woman is shown to have brought forth a child, and to be truly a
   mother, by which also she receives a potent charm of affection.
   Wherefore the Holy Spirit in the apostle, using the voice of the Lord,
   says mystically, "I have given you milk to drink." [1133] For if we
   have been regenerated unto Christ, He who has regenerated us nourishes
   us with His own milk, the Word; for it is proper that what has
   procreated should forthwith supply nourishment to that which has been
   procreated. And as the regeneration was conformably spiritual, so also
   was the nutriment of man spiritual. In all respects, therefore, and in
   all things, we are brought into union with Christ, into relationship
   through His blood, by which we are redeemed; and into sympathy, in
   consequence of the nourishment which flows from the Word; and into
   immortality, through His guidance:--


   "Among men the bringing up of children

   Often produces stronger impulses to love than the procreating of them."

   The same blood and milk of the Lord is therefore the symbol of the
   Lord's passion and teaching. Wherefore each of us babes is permitted to
   make our boast in the Lord, while we proclaim:--


   "Yet of a noble sire and noble blood I boast me sprung." [1134]

   And that milk is produced from blood by a change, is already clear; yet
   we may learn it from the flocks and herds. For these animals, in the
   time of the year which we call spring, when the air has more humidity,
   and the grass and meadows are juicy and moist, are first filled with
   blood, as is shown by the distension of the veins of the swollen
   vessels; and from the blood the milk flows more copiously. But in
   summer again, the blood being burnt and dried up by the heat, prevents
   the change, and so they have less milk.

   Further, milk has a most natural affinity for water, as assuredly the
   spiritual washing has for the spiritual nutriment. Those, therefore,
   that swallow a little cold water, in addition to the above-mentioned
   milk, straightway feel benefit; for the milk is prevented from souring
   by its combination with water, not in consequence of any antipathy
   between them, but in consequence of the water taking kindly to the milk
   while it is undergoing digestion.

   And such as is the union of the Word with baptism, is the agreement of
   milk with water; for it receives it alone of all liquids, and admits of
   mixture with water, for the purpose of cleansing, as baptism for the
   remission of sins. And it is mixed naturally with honey also, and this
   for cleansing along with sweet nutriment. For the Word blended with
   love at once cures our passions and cleanses our sins; and the saying,


   "Sweeter than honey flowed the stream of speech," [1135]

   seems to me to have been spoken of the Word, who is honey. And prophecy
   oft extols Him "above honey and the honeycomb." [1136]

   Furthermore, milk is mixed with sweet wine; and the mixture is
   beneficial, as when suffering is mixed in the cup in order to
   immortality. For the milk is curdled by the wine, and separated, and
   whatever adulteration is in it is drained off. And in the same way, the
   spiritual communion of faith with suffering man, drawing off as serous
   matter the lusts of the flesh, commits man to eternity, along with
   those who are divine, immortalizing him.

   Further, many also use the fat of milk, called butter, for the lamp,
   plainly indicating by this enigma the abundant unction of the Word,
   since He alone it is who nourishes the infants, makes them grow, and
   enlightens them. Wherefore also the Scripture says respecting the Lord,
   "He fed them with the produce of the fields; they sucked honey from the
   rock, and oil from the solid rock, butter of kine, and milk of sheep,
   with fat of lambs;" [1137] and what follows He gave them. But he that
   prophesies the birth of the child says: "Butter and honey shall He
   eat." [1138] And it occurs to me to wonder how some dare call
   themselves perfect and gnostics, with ideas of themselves above the
   apostle, inflated and boastful, when Paul even owned respecting
   himself, "Not that I have already attained, or am already perfect; but
   I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which I am apprehended
   of Christ. Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this
   one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching
   forth to those that are before, I press toward the mark, for the prize
   of the high calling in Christ Jesus." [1139] And yet he reckons himself
   perfect, because he has been emancipated from his former life, and
   strives after the better life, not as perfect in knowledge, but as
   aspiring after perfection. Wherefore also he adds, "As many of us as
   are perfect, are thus minded," [1140] manifestly describing perfection
   as the renunciation of sin, and regeneration into the faith of the only
   perfect One, and forgetting our former sins.

      Chapter VII.--Who the Instructor Is, and Respecting His Instruction.

   Since, then, we have shown that all of us are by Scripture called
   children; and not only so, but that we who have followed Christ are
   figuratively called babes; and that the Father of all alone is perfect,
   for the Son is in Him, and the Father is in the Son; it is time for us
   in due course to say who our Instructor is.

   He is called Jesus. Sometimes He calls Himself a shepherd, and says, "I
   am the good Shepherd." [1141] According to a metaphor drawn from
   shepherds, who lead the sheep, is hereby understood the Instructor, who
   leads the children--the Shepherd who tends the babes. For the babes are
   simple, being figuratively described as sheep. "And they shall all," it
   is said, "be one flock, and one shepherd." [1142] The Word, then, who
   leads the children to salvation, is appropriately called the Instructor
   [1143] (Pædagogue).

   With the greatest clearness, accordingly, the Word has spoken
   respecting Himself by Hosea: "I am your Instructor." [1144] Now piety
   is instruction, being the learning of the service of God, and training
   in the knowledge of the truth, and right guidance which leads to
   heaven. And the word "instruction" [1145] is employed variously. For
   there is the instruction of him who is led and learns, and that of him
   who leads and teaches; and there is, thirdly, the guidance itself; and
   fourthly, what is taught, as the commandments enjoined.

   Now the instruction which is of God is the right direction of truth to
   the contemplation of God, and the exhibition of holy deeds in
   everlasting perseverance.

   As therefore the general directs the phalanx, consulting the safety of
   his soldiers, and the pilot steers the vessel, desiring to save the
   passengers; so also the Instructor guides the children to a saving
   course of conduct, through solicitude for us; and, in general, whatever
   we ask in accordance with reason from God to be done for us, will
   happen to those who believe in the Instructor. And just as the helmsman
   does not always yield to the winds, but sometimes, turning the prow
   towards them, opposes the whole force of the hurricanes; so the
   Instructor never yields to the blasts that blow in this world, nor
   commits the child to them like a vessel to make shipwreck on a wild and
   licentious course of life; but, wafted on by the favouring breeze of
   the Spirit of truth, stoutly holds on to the child's helm,--his ears, I
   mean,--until He bring him safe to anchor in the haven of heaven.

   What is called by men an ancestral custom passes away in a moment, but
   the divine guidance is a possession which abides for ever.

   They say that Phoenix was the instructor of Achilles, and Adrastus of
   the children of Croesus; and Leonides of Alexander, and Nausithous of
   Philip. But Phoenix was women-mad, Adrastus was a fugitive. Leonides
   did not curtail the pride of Alexander, nor Nausithous reform the
   drunken Pellæan. No more was the Thracian Zopyrus able to check the
   fornication of Alcibiades; but Zopyrus was a bought slave, and
   Sicinnus, the tutor of the children of Themistocles, was a lazy
   domestic. They say also that he invented the Sicinnian dance. Those
   have not escaped our attention who are called royal instructors among
   the Persians; whom, in number four, the kings of the Persians select
   with the greatest care from all the Persians and set over their sons.
   But the children only learn the use of the bow, and on reaching
   maturity have sexual intercourse with sisters, and mothers, and women,
   wives and courtesans innumerable, practiced in intercourse like the
   wild boars.

   But our Instructor is the holy God Jesus, the Word, who is the guide of
   all humanity. The loving God Himself is our Instructor. Somewhere in
   song the Holy Spirit says with regard to Him, "He provided sufficiently
   for the people in the wilderness. He led him about in the thirst of
   summer heat in a dry land, and instructed him, and kept him as the
   apple of His eye, as an eagle protects her nest, and shows her fond
   solicitude for her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, and
   bears them on her back. The Lord alone led them, and there was no
   strange god with them." [1146] Clearly, I trow, has the Scripture
   exhibited the Instructor in the account it gives of His guidance.

   Again, when He speaks in His own person, He confesses Himself to be the
   Instructor: "I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of
   Egypt." [1147] Who, then, has the power of leading in and out? Is it
   not the Instructor? This was He who appeared to Abraham, and said to
   him, "I am thy God, be accepted before Me;" [1148] and in a way most
   befitting an instructor, forms him into a faithful child, saying, "And
   be blameless; and I will make My covenant between Me and thee, and thy
   seed." There is the communication of the Instructor's friendship. And
   He most manifestly appears as Jacob's instructor. He says accordingly
   to him, "Lo, I am with thee, to keep thee in all the way in which thou
   shalt go; and I will bring thee back into this land: for I will not
   leave thee till I do what I have told thee." [1149] He is said, too, to
   have wrestled with Him. "And Jacob was left alone, and there wrestled
   with him a man (the Instructor) till the morning." [1150] This was the
   man who led, and brought, and wrestled with, and anointed the athlete
   Jacob against evil. [1151] Now that the Word was at once Jacob's
   trainer and the Instructor of humanity [appears from this]--"He asked,"
   it is said, "His name, and said to him, Tell me what is Thy name." And
   he said, "Why is it that thou askest My name?" For He reserved the new
   name for the new people--the babe; and was as yet unnamed, the Lord God
   not having yet become man. Yet Jacob called the name of the place,
   "Face of God." "For I have seen," he says, "God face to face; and my
   life is preserved." [1152] The face of God is the Word by whom God is
   manifested and made known. Then also was he named Israel, because he
   saw God the Lord. It was God, the Word, the Instructor, who said to him
   again afterwards, "Fear not to go down into Egypt." [1153] See how the
   Instructor follows the righteous man, and how He anoints the athlete,
   teaching him to trip up his antagonist.

   It is He also who teaches Moses to act as instructor. For the Lord
   says, "If any one sin before Me, him will I blot out of My book; but
   now, go and lead this people into the place which I told thee." [1154]
   Here He is the teacher of the art of instruction. For it was really the
   Lord that was the instructor of the ancient people by Moses; but He is
   the instructor of the new people by Himself, face to face. "For
   behold," He says to Moses, "My angel shall go before thee,"
   representing the evangelical and commanding power of the Word, but
   guarding the Lord's prerogative. "In the day on which I will visit
   them," [1155] He says, "I will bring their sins on them; that is, on
   the day on which I will sit as judge I will render the recompense of
   their sins." For the same who is Instructor is judge, and judges those
   who disobey Him; and the loving Word will not pass over their
   transgression in silence. He reproves, that they may repent. For "the
   Lord willeth the repentance of the sinner rather than his death."
   [1156] And let us as babes, hearing of the sins of others, keep from
   similar transgressions, through dread of the threatening, that we may
   not have to undergo like sufferings. What, then, was the sin which they
   committed? "For in their wrath they slew men, and in their impetuosity
   they hamstrung bulls. Cursed be their anger." [1157] Who, then, would
   train us more lovingly than He? Formerly the older people had an old
   covenant, and the law disciplined the people with fear, and the Word
   was an angel; but to the fresh and new people has also been given a new
   covenant, and the Word has appeared, and fear is turned to love, and
   that mystic angel is born--Jesus. For this same Instructor said then,
   "Thou shalt fear the Lord God;" [1158] but to us He has addressed the
   exhortation, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God." [1159] Wherefore also
   this is enjoined on us: "Cease from your own works, from your old
   sins;" "Learn to do well;" "Depart from evil, and do good;" "Thou hast
   loved righteousness, and hated iniquity." This is my new covenant
   written in the old letter. The newness of the word must not, then, be
   made ground of reproach. But the Lord hath also said in Jeremiah: "Say
   not that I am a youth: before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee,
   and before I brought thee out of the womb I sanctified thee." [1160]
   Such allusions prophecy can make to us, destined in the eye of God to
   faith before the foundation of the world; but now babes, through the
   recent fulfilment of the will of God, according to which we are born
   now to calling and salvation. Wherefore also He adds, "I have set thee
   for a prophet to the nations," [1161] saying that he must prophesy, so
   that the appellation of "youth" should not become a reproach to those
   who are called babes.

   Now the law is ancient grace given through Moses by the Word. Wherefore
   also the Scripture says, "The law was given through Moses," [1162] not
   by Moses, but by the Word, and through Moses His servant. Wherefore it
   was only temporary; but eternal grace and truth were by Jesus Christ.
   Mark the expressions of Scripture: of the law only is it said "was
   given;" but truth being the grace of the Father, is the eternal work of
   the Word; and it is not said to be given, but to be by Jesus, without
   whom nothing was. [1163] Presently, therefore, Moses prophetically,
   giving place to the perfect Instructor the Word, predicts both the name
   and the office of Instructor, and committing to the people the commands
   of obedience, sets before them the Instructor. "A prophet," says he,
   "like Me shall God raise up to you of your brethren," pointing out
   Jesus the Son of God, by an allusion to Jesus the son of Nun; for the
   name of Jesus predicted in the law was a shadow of Christ. He adds,
   therefore, consulting the advantage of the people, "Him shall ye hear;"
   [1164] and, "The man who will not hear that Prophet," [1165] him He
   threatens. Such a name, then, he predicts as that of the Instructor,
   who is the author of salvation. Wherefore prophecy invests Him with a
   rod, a rod of discipline, of rule, of authority; that those whom the
   persuasive word heals not, the threatening may heal; and whom the
   threatening heals not, the rod may heal; and whom the rod heals not,
   the fire may devour. "There shall come forth," it is said, "a rod out
   of the root of Jesse." [1166]

   See the care, and wisdom, and power of the Instructor: "He shall not
   judge according to opinion, nor according to report; but He shall
   dispense judgment to the humble, and reprove the sinners of the earth."
   And by David: "The Lord instructing, hath instructed me, and not given
   me over to death." [1167] For to be chastised of the Lord, and
   instructed, is deliverance from death. And by the same prophet He says:
   "Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron." [1168] Thus also the
   apostle, in the Epistle to the Corinthians, being moved, says, "What
   will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, in the spirit of
   meekness?" [1169] Also, "The Lord shall send the rod of strength out of
   Sion," [1170] He says by another prophet. And this same rod of
   instruction, "Thy rod and staff have comforted me," [1171] said some
   one else. Such is the power of the Instructor--sacred, soothing,
   saving.

      Chapter VIII.--Against Those Who Think that What is Just is Not Good.

   At this stage some rise up, saying that the Lord, by reason of the rod,
   and threatening, and fear, is not good; misapprehending, as appears,
   the Scripture which says, "And he that feareth the Lord will turn to
   his heart;" [1172] and most of all, oblivious of His love, in that for
   us He became man. For more suitably to Him, the prophet prays in these
   words: "Remember us, for we are dust;" [1173] that is, Sympathize with
   us; for Thou knowest from personal experience of suffering the weakness
   of the flesh. In this respect, therefore, the Lord the Instructor is
   most good and unimpeachable, sympathizing as He does from the exceeding
   greatness of His love with the nature of each man. "For there is
   nothing which the Lord hates." [1174] For assuredly He does not hate
   anything, and yet wish that which He hates to exist. Nor does He wish
   anything not to exist, and yet become the cause of existence to that
   which He wishes not to exist. Nor does He wish anything not to exist
   which yet exists. If, then, the Word hates anything, He does not wish
   it to exist. But nothing exists, the cause of whose existence is not
   supplied by God. Nothing, then, is hated by God, nor yet by the Word.
   For both are one--that is, God. For He has said, "In the beginning the
   Word was in God, and the Word was God." [1175] If then He hates none of
   the things which He has made, it follows that He loves them. Much more
   than the rest, and with reason, will He love man, the noblest of all
   objects created by Him, and a God-loving being. Therefore God is
   loving; consequently the Word is loving.

   But he who loves anything wishes to do it good. And that which does
   good must be every way better than that which does not good. But
   nothing is better than the Good. The Good, then, does good. And God is
   admitted to be good. God therefore does good. And the Good, in virtue
   of its being good, does nothing else than do good. Consequently God
   does all good. And He does no good to man without caring for him, and
   He does not care for him without taking care of him. For that which
   does good purposely, is better than what does not good purposely. But
   nothing is better than God. And to do good purposely, is nothing else
   than to take care of man. God therefore cares for man, and takes care
   of him. And He shows this practically, in instructing him by the Word,
   who is the true coadjutor of God's love to man. But the good is not
   said to be good, on account of its being possessed of virtue; as also
   righteousness is not said to be good on account of its possessing
   virtue--for it is itself virtue--but on account of its being in itself
   and by itself good.

   In another way the useful is called good, not on account of its
   pleasing, but of its doing good. All which, therefore, is
   righteousness, being a good thing, both as virtue and as desirable for
   its own sake, and not as giving pleasure; for it does not judge in
   order to win favour, but dispenses to each according to his merits. And
   the beneficial follows the useful. Righteousness, therefore, has
   characteristics corresponding to all the aspects in which goodness is
   examined, both possessing equal properties equally. And things which
   are characterized by equal properties are equal and similar to each
   other. Righteousness is therefore a good thing.

   "How then," say they, "if the Lord loves man, and is good, is He angry
   and punishes?" We must therefore treat of this point with all possible
   brevity; for this mode of treatment is advantageous to the right
   training of the children, occupying the place of a necessary help. For
   many of the passions are cured by punishment, and by the inculcation of
   the sterner precepts, as also by instruction in certain principles. For
   reproof is, as it were, the surgery of the passions of the soul; and
   the passions are, as it were, an abscess of the truth, [1176] which
   must be cut open by an incision of the lancet of reproof.

   Reproach is like the application of medicines, dissolving the
   callosities of the passions, and purging the impurities of the lewdness
   of the life; and in addition, reducing the excrescences of pride,
   restoring the patient to the healthy and true state of humanity.

   Admonition is, as it were, the regimen of the diseased soul,
   prescribing what it must take, and forbidding what it must not. And all
   these tend to salvation and eternal health.

   Furthermore, the general of an army, by inflicting fines and corporeal
   punishments with chains and the extremest disgrace on offenders, and
   sometimes even by punishing individuals with death, aims at good, doing
   so for the admonition of the officers under him.

   Thus also He who is our great General, the Word, the Commander-in-chief
   of the universe, by admonishing those who throw off the restraints of
   His law, that He may effect their release from the slavery, error, and
   captivity of the adversary, brings them peacefully to the sacred
   concord of citizenship.

   As, therefore in addition to persuasive discourse, there is the
   hortatory and the consolatory form; so also, in addition to the
   laudatory, there is the inculpatory and reproachful. And this latter
   constitutes the art of censure. Now censure is a mark of good-will, not
   of ill-will. For both he who is a friend and he who is not, reproach;
   but the enemy does so in scorn, the friend in kindness. It is not,
   then, from hatred that the Lord chides men; for He Himself suffered for
   us, whom He might have destroyed for our faults. For the Instructor
   also, in virtue of His being good, with consummate art glides into
   censure by rebuke; rousing the sluggishness of the mind by His sharp
   words as by a scourge. Again in turn He endeavours to exhort the same
   persons. For those who are not induced by praise are spurred on by
   censure; and those whom censure calls not forth to salvation being as
   dead, are by denunciation roused to the truth. "For the stripes and
   correction of wisdom are in all time." "For teaching a fool is gluing a
   potsherd; and sharpening to sense a hopeless blockhead is bringing
   earth to sensation." [1177] Wherefore He adds plainly, "rousing the
   sleeper from deep sleep," which of all things else is likest death.

   Further, the Lord shows very clearly of Himself, when, describing
   figuratively His manifold and in many ways serviceable culture,--He
   says, "I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman." Then He
   adds, "Every branch in me that beareth not fruit He taketh away; and
   every branch that beareth fruit He pruneth, that it may bring forth
   more fruit." [1178] For the vine that is not pruned grows to wood. So
   also man. The Word--the knife--clears away the wanton shoots;
   compelling the impulses of the soul to fructify, not to indulge in
   lust. Now, reproof addressed to sinners has their salvation for its
   aim, the word being harmoniously adjusted to each one's conduct; now
   with tightened, now with relaxed cords. Accordingly it was very plainly
   said by Moses, "Be of good courage: God has drawn near to try you, that
   His fear may be among you, that ye sin not." [1179] And Plato, who had
   learned from this source, says beautifully: "For all who suffer
   punishment are in reality treated well, for they are benefited; since
   the spirit of those who are justly punished is improved." And if those
   who are corrected receive good at the hands of justice, and, according
   to Plato, what is just is acknowledged to be good, fear itself does
   good, and has been found to be for men's good. "For the soul that
   feareth the Lord shall live, for their hope is in Him who saveth them."
   [1180] And this same Word who inflicts punishment is judge; regarding
   whom Esaias also says, "The Lord has assigned Him to our sins," [1181]
   plainly as a corrector and reformer of sins. Wherefore He alone is able
   to forgive our iniquities, who has been appointed by the Father,
   Instructor of us all; He alone it is who is able to distinguish between
   disobedience and obedience. And while He threatens, He manifestly is
   unwilling to inflict evil to execute His threatenings; but by inspiring
   men with fear, He cuts off the approach to sin, and shows His love to
   man, still delaying, and declaring what they shall suffer if they
   continue sinners, and is not as a serpent, which the moment it fastens
   on its prey devours it.

   God, then, is good. And the Lord speaks many a time and oft before He
   proceeds to act. "For my arrows," He says, "will make an end of them;
   they shall be consumed with hunger, and be eaten by birds; and there
   shall be incurable tetanic incurvature. I will send the teeth of wild
   beasts upon them, with the rage of serpents creeping on the earth.
   Without, the sword shall make them childless; and out of their chambers
   shall be fear." [1182] For the Divine Being is not angry in the way
   that some think; but often restrains, and always exhorts humanity, and
   shows what ought to be done. And this is a good device, to terrify lest
   we sin. "For the fear of the Lord drives away sins, and he that is
   without fear cannot be justified," [1183] says the Scripture. And God
   does not inflict punishment from wrath, but for the ends of justice;
   since it is not expedient that justice should be neglected on our
   account. Each one of us, who sins, with his own free-will chooses
   punishment, and the blame lies with him who chooses. [1184] God is
   without blame. "But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of
   God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous, who taketh vengeance? God
   forbid." [1185] He says, therefore, threatening, "I will sharpen my
   sword, and my hand shall lay hold on judgment; and I will render
   justice to mine enemies, and requite those who hate me. I will make
   mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh from the
   blood of the wounded." [1186] It is clear, then, that those who are not
   at enmity with the truth, and do not hate the Word, will not hate their
   own salvation, but will escape the punishment of enmity. "The crown of
   wisdom," then, as the book of Wisdom says, "is the fear of the Lord."
   [1187] Very clearly, therefore, by the prophet Amos has the Lord
   unfolded His method of dealing, saying, "I have overthrown you, as God
   overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah; and ye shall be as a brand plucked from
   the fire: and yet ye have not returned unto me, saith the Lord." [1188]

   See how God, through His love of goodness, seeks repentance; and by
   means of the plan He pursues of threatening silently, shows His own
   love for man. "I will avert," He says, "My face from them, and show
   what shall happen to them." [1189] For where the face of the Lord
   looks, there is peace and rejoicing; but where it is averted, there is
   the introduction of evil. The Lord, accordingly, does not wish to look
   on evil things; for He is good. But on His looking away, evil arises
   spontaneously through human unbelief. "Behold, therefore," says Paul,
   "the goodness and severity of God: on them that fell, severity; but
   upon thee, goodness, if thou continue in His goodness," [1190] that is,
   in faith in Christ.

   Now hatred of evil attends the good man, in virtue of His being in
   nature good. Wherefore I will grant that He punishes the disobedient
   (for punishment is for the good and advantage of him who is punished,
   for it is the correction of a refractory subject); but I will not grant
   that He wishes to take vengeance. Revenge is retribution for evil,
   imposed for the advantage of him who takes the revenge. He will not
   desire us to take revenge, who teaches us "to pray for those that
   despitefully use us." [1191] But that God is good, all willingly admit;
   and that the same God is just, I require not many more words to prove,
   after adducing the evangelical utterance of the Lord; He speaks of Him
   as one, "That they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in
   Thee, that they also may be one in Us: that the world also may believe
   that Thou hast sent Me. And the glory which Thou hast given Me I have
   given them; that they may be one, as We are one: I in them, and Thou in
   Me, that they may be made perfect in one." [1192] God is one, and
   beyond the one and above the Monad itself. Wherefore also the particle
   "Thou," having a demonstrative emphasis, points out God, who alone
   truly is, "who was, and is, and is to come," in which three divisions
   of time the one name (o on); "who is," [1193] has its place. And that
   He who alone is God is also alone and truly righteous, our Lord in the
   Gospel itself shall testify, saying "Father, I will that they also whom
   Thou hast given Me be with Me where I am; that they may behold My
   glory, which Thou hast given Me: For Thou lovedst Me before the
   foundation of the world. O righteous Father, the world hath not known
   Thee: but I have known Thee, and these have known that Thou hast sent
   Me. And I have declared to them Thy name, and will declare it." [1194]
   This is He "that visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the
   children, to them that hate Him, and shows mercy to those that love
   Him." [1195] For He who placed some "on the right hand, and others on
   the left," [1196] conceived as Father, being good, is called that which
   alone He is--"good;" [1197] but as He is the Son in the Father, being
   his Word, from their mutual relation, the name of power being measured
   by equality of love, He is called righteous. "He will judge," He says,
   "a man according to his works," [1198] --a good balance, even God
   having made known to us the face of righteousness in the person of
   Jesus, by whom also, as by even scales, we know God. Of this also the
   book of Wisdom plainly says, "For mercy and wrath are with Him, for He
   alone is Lord of both," Lord of propitiations, and pouring forth wrath
   according to the abundance of His mercy. "So also is His reproof."
   [1199] For the aim of mercy and of reproof is the salvation of those
   who are reproved.

   Now, that the God and Father of our Lord Jesus is good, the Word
   Himself will again avouch: "For He is kind to the unthankful and the
   evil;" and further, when He says, "Be merciful, as your Father is
   merciful." [1200] Still further also He plainly says, "None is good,
   but My Father, who is in heaven." [1201] In addition to these, again He
   says, "My Father makes His sun to shine on all." [1202] Here it is to
   be noted that He proclaims His Father to be good, and to be the
   Creator. And that the Creator is just, is not disputed. And again he
   says, "My Father sends rain on the just, and on the unjust." In respect
   of His sending rain, He is the Creator of the waters, and of the
   clouds. And in respect of His doing so on all, He holds an even balance
   justly and rightly. And as being good, He does so on just and unjust
   alike.

   Very clearly, then, we conclude Him to be one and the same God, thus.
   For the Holy Spirit has sung, "I will look to the heavens, the works of
   Thy hands;" [1203] and, "He who created the heavens dwells in the
   heavens;" and, "Heaven is Thy throne." [1204] And the Lord says in His
   prayer, "Our Father, who art in heaven." [1205] And the heavens belong
   to Him, who created the world. It is indisputable, then, that the Lord
   is the Son of the Creator. And if, the Creator above all is confessed
   to be just, and the Lord to be the Son of the Creator; then the Lord is
   the Son of Him who is just. Wherefore also Paul says, "But now the
   righteousness of God without the law is manifested;" [1206] and again,
   that you may better conceive of God, "even the righteousness of God by
   the faith of Jesus Christ upon all that believe; for there is no
   difference." [1207] And, witnessing further to the truth, he adds after
   a little, "through the forbearance of God, in order to show that He is
   just, and that Jesus is the justifier of him who is of faith." And that
   he knows that what is just is good, appears by his saying, "So that the
   law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good," [1208]
   using both names to denote the same power. But "no one is good," except
   His Father. It is this same Father of His, then, who being one is
   manifested by many powers. And this was the import of the utterance,
   "No man knew the Father," [1209] who was Himself everything before the
   coming of the Son. So that it is veritably clear that the God of all is
   only one good, just Creator, and the Son in the Father, to whom be
   glory for ever and ever, Amen. But it is not inconsistent with the
   saving Word, to administer rebuke dictated by solicitude. For this is
   the medicine of the divine love to man, by which the blush of modesty
   breaks forth, and shame at sin supervenes. For if one must censure, it
   is necessary also to rebuke; when it is the time to wound the apathetic
   soul not mortally, but salutarily, securing exemption from everlasting
   death by a little pain.

   Great is the wisdom displayed in His instruction, and manifold the
   modes of His dealing in order to salvation. For the Instructor
   testifies to the good, and summons forth to better things those that
   are called; dissuades those that are hastening to do wrong from the
   attempt, and exhorts them to turn to a better life. For the one is not
   without testimony, when the other has been testified to; and the grace
   which proceeds from the testimony is very great. Besides, the feeling
   of anger (if it is proper to call His admonition anger) is full of love
   to man, God condescending to emotion on man's account; for whose sake
   also the Word of God became man.

      Chapter IX.--That It is the Prerogative of the Same Power to Be Beneficent
      and to Punish Justly. Also the Manner of the Instruction of the Logos.

   With all His power, therefore, the Instructor of humanity, the Divine
   Word, using all the resources of wisdom, devotes Himself to the saving
   of the children, admonishing, upbraiding, blaming, chiding, reproving,
   threatening, healing, promising, favouring; and as it were, by many
   reins, curbing the irrational impulses of humanity. To speak briefly,
   therefore, the Lord acts towards us as we do towards our children.
   "Hast thou children? correct them," is the exhortation of the book of
   Wisdom, "and bend them from their youth. Hast thou daughters? attend to
   their body, and let not thy face brighten towards them," [1210]
   --although we love our children exceedingly, both sons and daughters,
   above aught else whatever. For those who speak with a man merely to
   please him, have little love for him, seeing they do not pain him;
   while those that speak for his good, though they inflict pain for the
   time, do him good for ever after. It is not immediate pleasure, but
   future enjoyment, that the Lord has in view.

   Let us now proceed to consider the mode of His loving discipline, with
   the aid of the prophetic testimony.

   Admonition, then, is the censure of loving care, and produces
   understanding. Such is the Instructor in His admonitions, as when He
   says in the Gospel, "How often would I have gathered thy children, as a
   bird gathers her young ones under her wings, and ye would not!" [1211]
   And again, the Scripture admonishes, saying, "And they committed
   adultery with stock and stone, and burnt incense to Baal." [1212] For
   it is a very great proof of His love, that, though knowing well the
   shamelessness of the people that had kicked and bounded away, He
   notwithstanding exhorts them to repentance, and says by Ezekiel, "Son
   of man, thou dwellest in the midst of scorpions; nevertheless, speak to
   them, if peradventure they will hear." [1213] Further, to Moses He
   says, "Go and tell Pharaoh to send My people forth; but I know that he
   will not send them forth." [1214] For He shows both things: both His
   divinity in His foreknowledge of what would take place, and His love in
   affording an opportunity for repentance to the self-determination of
   the soul. He admonishes also by Esaias, in His care for the people,
   when He says, "This people honour Me with their lips, but their heart
   is far from Me." What follows is reproving censure: "In vain do they
   worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men." [1215]
   Here His loving care, having shown their sin, shows salvation side by
   side.

   Upbraiding is censure on account of what is base, conciliating to what
   is noble. This is shown by Jeremiah: "They were female-mad horses; each
   one neighed after his neighbour's wife. Shall I not visit for these
   things? saith the Lord: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation
   as this?" [1216] He everywhere interweaves fear, because "the fear of
   the Lord is the beginning of sense." [1217] And again, by Hosea, He
   says, "Shall I not visit them? for they themselves were mingled with
   harlots, and sacrificed with the initiated; and the people that
   understood embraced a harlot." [1218] He shows their offence to be
   clearer, by declaring that they understood, and thus sinned wilfully.
   Understanding is the eye of the soul; wherefore also Israel means, "he
   that sees God"--that is, he that understands God.

   Complaint is censure of those who are regarded as despising or
   neglecting. He employs this form when He says by Esaias: "Hear, O
   heaven; and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have
   begotten and brought up children, but they have disregarded Me. The ox
   knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not
   known Me." [1219] For how shall we not regard it fearful, if he that
   knows God, shall not recognise the Lord; but while the ox and the ass,
   stupid and foolish animals, will know him who feeds them, Israel is
   found to be more irrational than these? And having, by Jeremiah,
   complained against the people on many grounds, He adds: "And they have
   forsaken Me, saith the Lord." [1220]

   Invective [1221] is a reproachful upbraiding, or chiding censure. This
   mode of treatment the Instructor employs in Isaiah, when He says, "Woe
   to you, children revolters. Thus saith the Lord, Ye have taken counsel,
   but not by Me; and made compacts, but not by My Spirit." [1222] He uses
   the very bitter mordant of fear in each case repressing [1223] the
   people, and at the same time turning them to salvation; as also wool
   that is undergoing the process of dyeing is wont to be previously
   treated with mordants, in order to prepare it for taking on a fast
   colour.

   Reproof is the bringing forward of sin, laying it before one. This form
   of instruction He employs as in the highest degree necessary, by reason
   of the feebleness of the faith of many. For He says by Esaias, "Ye have
   forsaken the Lord, and have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger."
   [1224] And He says also by Jeremiah: "Heaven was astonished at this,
   and the earth shuddered exceedingly. For My people have committed two
   evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, and have
   hewn out to themselves broken cisterns, which will not be able to hold
   water." [1225] And again, by the same: "Jerusalem hath sinned a sin;
   therefore it became commotion. All that glorified her dishonoured her,
   when they saw her baseness." [1226] And He uses the bitter and biting
   [1227] language of reproof in His consolations by Solomon, tacitly
   alluding to the love for children that characterizes His instruction:
   "My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord; nor faint when
   thou art rebuked of Him: for whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and
   scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;" [1228] "For a man who is a
   sinner escapes reproof." [1229] Consequently, therefore, the Scripture
   says, "Let the righteous reprove and correct me; but let not the oil of
   the sinner anoint my head." [1230]

   Bringing one to his senses (phrenosis) is censure, which makes a man
   think. Neither from this form of instruction does he abstain, but says
   by Jeremiah, "How long shall I cry, and you not hear? So your ears are
   uncircumcised." [1231] O blessed forbearance! And again, by the same:
   "All the heathen are uncircumcised, but this people is uncircumcised in
   heart:" [1232] "for the people are disobedient; children," says He, "in
   whom is not faith." [1233]

   Visitation is severe rebuke. He uses this species in the Gospel: "O
   Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that killest the prophets, and stonest them that
   are sent unto thee!" The reduplication of the name gives strength to
   the rebuke. For he that knows God, how does he persecute God's
   servants? Wherefore He says, "Your house is left desolate; for I say
   unto you, Henceforth ye shall not see Me, till ye shall say, Blessed is
   He that cometh in the name of the Lord." [1234] For if you do not
   receive His love, ye shall know His power.

   Denunciation is vehement speech. And He employs denunciation as
   medicine, by Isaiah, saying, "Ah, sinful nation, lawless sons, people
   full of sins, wicked seed!" [1235] And in the Gospel by John He says,
   "Serpents, brood of vipers." [1236]

   Accusation is censure of wrong-doers. This mode of instruction He
   employs by David, when He says: "The people whom I knew not served me,
   and at the hearing of the ear obeyed me. Sons of strangers lied to me,
   and halted from their ways." [1237] And by Jeremiah: "And I gave her a
   writing of divorcement, and covenant-breaking Judah feared not." [1238]
   And again: "And the house of Israel disregarded Me; and the house of
   Judah lied to the Lord." [1239]

   Bewailing one's fate is latent censure, and by artful aid ministers
   salvation as under a veil. He made use of this by Jeremiah: "How did
   the city sit solitary that was full of people! She that ruled over
   territories became as a widow; she came under tribute; weeping, she
   wept in the night." [1240]

   Objurgation is objurgatory censure. Of this help the Divine Instructor
   made use by Jeremiah, saying, "Thou hadst a whore's forehead; thou wast
   shameless towards all; and didst not call me to the house, who am thy
   father, and lord of thy virginity." [1241] "And a fair and graceful
   harlot skilled in enchanted potions." [1242] With consummate art, after
   applying to the virgin the opprobrious name of whoredom, He thereupon
   calls her back to an honourable life by filling her with shame.

   Indignation is a rightful upbraiding; or upbraiding on account of ways
   exalted above what is right. In this way He instructed by Moses, when
   He said, "Faulty children, a generation crooked and perverse, do ye
   thus requite the Lord? This people is foolish, and not wise. Is not
   this thy father who acquired thee?" [1243] He says also by Isaiah, "Thy
   princes are disobedient, companions of thieves, loving gifts, following
   after rewards, not judging the orphans." [1244]

   In fine, the system He pursues to inspire fear is the source of
   salvation. And it is the prerogative of goodness to save: "The mercy of
   the Lord is on all flesh, while He reproves, corrects, and teaches as a
   shepherd His flock. He pities those who receive His instruction, and
   those who eagerly seek union with Him." [1245] And with such guidance
   He guarded the six hundred thousand footmen that were brought together
   in the hardness of heart in which they were found; scourging, pitying,
   striking, healing, in compassion and discipline: "For according to the
   greatness of His mercy, so is His rebuke." [1246] For it is indeed
   noble not to sin; but it is good also for the sinner to repent; just as
   it is best to be always in good health, but well to recover from
   disease. So He commands by Solomon: "Strike thou thy son with the rod,
   that thou mayest deliver his soul from death." [1247] And again:
   "Abstain not from chastising thy son, but correct him with the rod; for
   he will not die." [1248]

   For reproof and rebuke, as also the original term implies, are the
   stripes of the soul, chastizing sins, preventing death, and leading to
   self-control those carried away to licentiousness. Thus also Plato,
   knowing reproof to be the greatest power for reformation, and the most
   sovereign purification, in accordance with what has been said,
   observes, "that he who is in the highest degree impure is uninstructed
   and base, by reason of his being unreproved in those respects in which
   he who is destined to be truly happy ought to be purest and best."

   For if rulers are not a terror to a good work, how shall God, who is by
   nature good, be a terror to him who sins not? "If thou doest evil, be
   afraid," [1249] says the apostle. Wherefore the apostle himself also in
   every case uses stringent language to the Churches, after the Lord's
   example; and conscious of his own boldness, and of the weakness of his
   hearers, he says to the Galatians: "Am I your enemy, because I tell you
   the truth?" [1250] Thus also people in health do not require a
   physician, do not require him as long as they are strong; but those who
   are ill need his skill. Thus also we who in our lives are ill of
   shameful lusts and reprehensible excesses, and other inflammatory
   effects of the passions, need the Saviour. And He administers not only
   mild, but also stringent medicines. The bitter roots of fear then
   arrest the eating sores of our sins. Wherefore also fear is salutary,
   if bitter. Sick, we truly stand in need of the Saviour; having
   wandered, of one to guide us; blind, of one to lead us to the light;
   thirsty, "of the fountain of life, of which whosoever partakes, shall
   no longer thirst;" [1251] dead, we need life; sheep, we need a
   shepherd; we who are children need a tutor, while universal humanity
   stands in need of Jesus; so that we may not continue intractable and
   sinners to the end, and thus fall into condemnation, but may be
   separated from the chaff, and stored up in the paternal garner. "For
   the fan is in the Lord's hand, by which the chaff due to the fire is
   separated from the wheat." [1252] You may learn, if you will, the
   crowning wisdom of the all-holy Shepherd and Instructor, of the
   omnipotent and paternal Word, when He figuratively represents Himself
   as the Shepherd of the sheep. And He is the Tutor of the children. He
   says therefore by Ezekiel, directing His discourse to the elders, and
   setting before them a salutary description of His wise solicitude: "And
   that which is lame I will bind up, and that which is sick I will heal,
   and that which has wandered I will turn back; and I will feed them on
   my holy mountain." [1253] Such are the promises of the good Shepherd.

   Feed us, the children, as sheep. Yea, Master, fill us with
   righteousness, Thine own pasture; yea, O Instructor, feed us on Thy
   holy mountain the Church, which towers aloft, which is above the
   clouds, which touches heaven. "And I will be," He says, "their
   Shepherd," [1254] and will be near them, as the garment to their skin.
   He wishes to save my flesh by enveloping it in the robe of immortality,
   and He hath anointed my body. "They shall call Me," He says, "and I
   will say, Here am I." [1255] Thou didst hear sooner than I expected,
   Master. "And if they pass over, they shall not slip," [1256] saith the
   Lord. For we who are passing over to immortality shall not fall into
   corruption, for He shall sustain us. For so He has said, and so He has
   willed. Such is our Instructor, righteously good. "I came not," He
   says, "to be ministered unto, but to minister." [1257] Wherefore He is
   introduced in the Gospel "wearied," [1258] because toiling for us, and
   promising "to give His life a ransom for many." [1259] For him alone
   who does so He owns to be the good shepherd. Generous, therefore, is He
   who gives for us the greatest of all gifts, His own life; and
   beneficent exceedingly, and loving to men, in that, when He might have
   been Lord, He wished to be a brother man; and so good was He that He
   died for us.

   Further, His righteousness cried, "If ye come straight to me, I also
   will come straight to you but if ye walk crooked, I also will walk
   crooked, saith the Lord of hosts;" [1260] meaning by the crooked ways
   the chastisements of sinners. For the straight and natural way which is
   indicated by the Iota of the name of Jesus is His goodness, which is
   firm and sure towards those who have believed at hearing: "When I
   called, ye obeyed not, saith the Lord; but set at nought my counsels,
   and heeded not my reproofs." [1261] Thus the Lord's reproof is most
   beneficial. David also says of them, "A perverse and provoking race; a
   race which set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not
   faithful with God: they kept not the covenant of God, and would not
   walk in His law." [1262]

   Such are the causes of provocation for which the Judge comes to inflict
   punishment on those that would not choose a life of goodness. Wherefore
   also afterwards He assailed them more roughly; in order, if possible,
   to drag them back from their impetuous rush towards death. He therefore
   tells by David the most manifest cause of the threatening: "They
   believed not in His wonderful works. When He slew them, they sought
   after Him, and turned and inquired early after God; and remembered that
   God was their Helper, and God the Most High their Redeemer." [1263]
   Thus He knew that they turned for fear, while they despised His love:
   for, for the most part, that goodness which is always mild is despised;
   but He who admonishes by the loving fear of righteousness is
   reverenced.

   There is a twofold species of fear, the one of which is accompanied
   with reverence, such as citizens show towards good rulers, and we
   towards God, as also right-minded children towards their fathers. "For
   an unbroken horse turns out unmanageable, and a son who is let take his
   own way turns out reckless." [1264] The other species of fear is
   accompanied with hatred, which slaves feel towards hard masters, and
   the Hebrews felt, who made God a master, not a father. And as far as
   piety is concerned, that which is voluntary and spontaneous differs
   much, nay entirely, from what is forced. "For He," it is said, "is
   merciful; He will heal their sins, and not destroy them, and fully turn
   away His anger, and not kindle all His wrath." [1265] See how the
   justice of the Instructor, which deals in rebukes, is shown; and the
   goodness of God, which deals in compassions. Wherefore David--that is,
   the Spirit by him--embracing them both, sings of God Himself, "Justice
   and judgment are the preparation of His throne: mercy and truth shall
   go before Thy face." [1266] He declares that it belongs to the same
   power both to judge and to do good. For there is power over both
   together, and judgment separates that which is just from its opposite.
   And He who is truly God is just and good; who is Himself all, and all
   is He; for He is God, the only God.

   For as the mirror is not evil to an ugly man because it shows him what
   like he is; and as the physician is not evil to the sick man because he
   tells him of his fever,--for the physician is not the cause of the
   fever, but only points out the fever;--so neither is He, that reproves,
   ill-disposed towards him who is diseased in soul. For He does not put
   the transgressions on him, but only shows the sins which are there; in
   order to turn him away from similar practices. So God is good on His
   own account, and just also on ours, and He is just because He is good.
   And His justice is shown to us by His own Word from there from above,
   whence the Father was. For before He became Creator He was God; He was
   good. And therefore He wished to be Creator and Father. And the nature
   of all that love was the source of righteousness--the cause, too, of
   His lighting up His sun, and sending down His own Son. And He first
   announced the good righteousness that is from heaven, when He said, "No
   man knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor the Father, but the Son."
   [1267] This mutual and reciprocal knowledge is the symbol of primeval
   justice. Then justice came down to men both in the letter and in the
   body, in the Word and in the law, constraining humanity to saving
   repentance; for it was good. But do you not obey God? Then blame
   yourself, who drag to yourself the judge.

      Chapter X.--That the Same God, by the Same Word, Restrains from Sin by
      Threatening, and Saves Humanity by Exhorting.

   If, then, we have shown that the plan of dealing stringently with
   humanity is good and salutary, and necessarily adopted by the Word, and
   conducive to repentance and the prevention of sins; we shall have now
   to look in order at the mildness of the Word. For He has been
   demonstrated to be just. He sets before us His own inclinations which
   invite to salvation; by which, in accordance with the Father's will, He
   wishes to make known to us the good and the useful. Consider these. The
   good (to kalon) belongs to the panegyrical form of speech, the useful
   to the persuasive. For the hortatory and the dehortatory are a form of
   the persuasive, and the laudatory and inculpatory of the panegyrical.

   For the persuasive style of sentence in one form becomes hortatory, and
   in another dehortatory. So also the panegyrical in one form becomes
   inculpatory, and in another laudatory. And in these exercises the
   Instructor, the Just One, who has proposed our advantage as His aim, is
   chiefly occupied. But the inculpatory and dehortatory forms of speech
   have been already shown us; and we must now handle the persuasive and
   the laudatory, and, as on a beam, balance the equal scales of justice.
   The exhortation to what is useful, the Instructor employs by Solomon,
   to the following effect: "I exhort you, O men; and I utter my voice to
   the sons of men. Hear me; for I will speak of excellent things;" [1268]
   and so on. And He counsels what is salutary: for counsel has for its
   end, choosing or refusing a certain course; as He does by David, when
   He says, "Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsels of the
   ungodly, and standeth not in the way of sinners, and sitteth not in the
   chair of pestilences; but his will is in the law of the Lord." [1269]
   And there are three departments of counsel: That which takes examples
   from past times; as what the Hebrews suffered when they worshipped the
   golden calf, and what they suffered when they committed fornication,
   and the like. The second, whose meaning is understood from the present
   times, as being apprehended by perception; as it was said to those who
   asked the Lord, "If He was the Christ, or shall we wait for another? Go
   and tell John, the blind receive their sight, the deaf hear, the lepers
   are cleansed, the dead are raised up; and blessed is he who shall not
   be offended in Me." [1270] Such was that which David said when he
   prophesied, "As we have heard, so have we seen." [1271] And the third
   department of counsel consists of what is future, by which we are
   bidden guard against what is to happen; as also that was said, "They
   that fall into sins shall be cast into outer darkness, where there
   shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth," [1272] and the like. So that
   from these things it is clear that the Lord, going the round of all the
   methods of curative treatment, calls humanity to salvation.

   By encouragement He assuages sins, reducing lust, and at the same time
   inspiring hope for salvation. For He says by Ezekiel, "If ye return
   with your whole heart, and say, Father, I will hear you, as a holy
   people." [1273] And again He says, "Come all to Me, who labour, and are
   heavy laden, and I will give you rest;" [1274] and that which is added
   the Lord speaks in His own person. And very clearly He calls to
   goodness by Solomon, when He says, "Blessed is the man who hath found
   wisdom, and the mortal who hath found understanding." [1275] "For the
   good is found by him who seeks it, and is wont to be seen by him who
   has found it." [1276] By Jeremiah, too, He sets forth prudence, when he
   says, "Blessed are we, Israel; for what is pleasing to God is known by
   us; [1277] --and it is known by the Word, by whom we are blessed and
   wise. For wisdom and knowledge are mentioned by the same prophet, when
   he says, "Hear, O Israel, the commandments of life, and give ear to
   know understanding." [1278] By Moses, too, by reason of the love He has
   to man, He promises a gift to those who hasten to salvation. For He
   says, "And I will bring you into the good land, which the Lord sware to
   your fathers." [1279] And further, "And I will bring you into the holy
   mountain, and make you glad," [1280] He says by Isaiah. And still
   another form of instruction is benediction. "And blessed is he," He
   saith by David, "who has not sinned; and he shall be as the tree
   planted near the channels of the waters, which will yield its fruit in
   its season, and his leaf shall not wither" [1281] (by this He made an
   allusion to the resurrection); "and whatsoever he shall do shall
   prosper with him." Such He wishes us to be, that we may be blessed.
   Again, showing the opposite scale of the balance of justice, He says,
   "But not so the ungodly--not so; but as the dust which the wind sweeps
   away from the face of the earth." [1282] By showing the punishment of
   sinners, and their easy dispersion, and carrying off by the wind, the
   Instructor dissuades from crime by means of punishment; and by holding
   up the merited penalty, shows the benignity of His beneficence in the
   most skilful way, in order that we may possess and enjoy its blessings.
   He invites us to knowledge also, when He says by Jeremiah, "Hadst thou
   walked in the way of God, thou wouldst have dwelt for ever in peace;"
   [1283] for, exhibiting there the reward of knowledge, He calls the wise
   to the love of it. And, granting pardon to him who has erred, He says,
   "Turn, turn, as a grape-gatherer to his basket." [1284] Do you see the
   goodness of justice, in that it counsels to repentance? And still
   further, by Jeremiah, He enlightens in the truth those who have erred.
   "Thus saith the Lord, Stand in the ways, and look, and ask for the
   eternal paths of the Lord, what is the good path, and walk in it, and
   ye shall find purification for your souls." [1285] And in order to
   promote our salvation, He leads us to repentance. Wherefore He says,
   "If thou repent, the Lord will purify thy heart, and the heart of thy
   seed." [1286] We might have adduced, as supporters on this question,
   the philosophers who say that only the perfect man is worthy of praise,
   and the bad man of blame. But since some slander beatitude, as neither
   itself taking any trouble, nor giving any to any one else, thus not
   understanding its love to man; on their account, and on account of
   those who do not associate justice with goodness, the following remarks
   are added. For it were a legitimate inference to say, that rebuke and
   censure are suitable to men, since they say that all men are bad; but
   God alone is wise, from whom cometh wisdom, and alone perfect, and
   therefore alone worthy of praise. But I do not employ such language. I
   say, then, that praise or blame, or whatever resembles praise or blame,
   are medicines most essential of all to men. Some are ill to cure, and,
   like iron, are wrought into shape with fire, and hammer, and anvil,
   that is, with threatening, and reproof, and chastisement; while others,
   cleaving to faith itself, as self-taught, and as acting of their own
   free-will, grow by praise:--


   "For virtue that is praised

   Grows like a tree."

   And comprehending this, as it seems to me, the Samian Pythagoras gives
   the injunction:--


   "When you have done base things, rebuke yourself;

   But when you have done good things, be glad."

   Chiding is also called admonishing; and the etymology of admonishing
   (nouthetesis) is (nou enthematismos) putting of understanding into one;
   so that rebuking is bringing one to one's senses.

   But there are myriads of injunctions to be found, whose aim is the
   attainment of what is good, and the avoidance of what is evil. "For
   there is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord." [1287] Wherefore by
   Solomon He commands the children to beware: "My son, let not sinners
   deceive thee, and go not after their ways; and go not, if they entice
   thee, saying, Come with us, share with us in innocent blood, and let us
   hide unjustly the righteous man in the earth; let us put him out of
   sight, all alive as he is into Hades." [1288] This is accordingly
   likewise a prediction concerning the Lord's passion. And by Ezekiel,
   the life supplies commandments: "The soul that sinneth shall die; but
   he that doeth righteousness shall be righteous. He eateth not upon the
   mountains, and hath not set his eyes on the devices of the house of
   Israel, and will not defile his neighbour's wife, and will not approach
   to a woman in her separation, and will not oppress a man, and will
   restore the debtor's pledge, and will not take plunder: he will give
   his bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked. His money he will not
   give on usury, and will not take interest; and he will turn away his
   hand from wrong, and will execute righteous judgment between a man and
   his neighbour. He has walked in my statutes, and kept my judgments to
   do them. This is a righteous man. He shall surely live, saith the
   Lord." [1289] These words contain a description of the conduct of
   Christians, a notable exhortation to the blessed life, which is the
   reward of a life of goodness--everlasting life.

      Chapter XI.--That the Word Instructed by the Law and the Prophets.

   The mode of His love and His instruction we have shown as we could.
   Wherefore He Himself, declaring Himself very beautifully, likened
   Himself to a grain of mustard-seed; [1290] and pointed out the
   spirituality of the word that is sown, and the productiveness of its
   nature, and the magnificence and conspicuousness of the power of the
   word; and besides, intimated that the pungency and the purifying virtue
   of punishment are profitable on account of its sharpness. By the little
   grain, as it is figuratively called, He bestows salvation on all
   humanity abundantly. Honey, being very sweet, generates bile, as
   goodness begets contempt, which is the cause of sinning. But mustard
   lessens bile, that is, anger, and stops inflammation, that is, pride.
   From which Word springs the true health of the soul, and its eternal
   happy temperament (eukrasia).

   Accordingly, of old He instructed by Moses, and then by the prophets.
   Moses, too, was a prophet. For the law is the training of refractory
   children. "Having feasted to the full," accordingly, it is said, "they
   rose up to play;" [1291] senseless repletion with victuals being called
   chortasma (fodder), not broma (food). And when, having senselessly
   filled themselves, they senselessly played; on that account the law was
   given them, and terror ensued for the prevention of transgressions and
   for the promotion of right actions, securing attention, and so winning
   to obedience to the true Instructor, being one and the same Word, and
   reducing to conformity with the urgent demands of the law. For Paul
   says that it was given to be a "schoolmaster to bring us to Christ."
   [1292] So that from this it is clear, that one alone, true, good, just,
   in the image and likeness of the Father, His Son Jesus, the Word of
   God, is our Instructor; to whom God hath entrusted us, as an
   affectionate father commits his children to a worthy tutor, expressly
   charging us, "This is my beloved Son: hear Him." [1293] The divine
   Instructor is trustworthy, adorned as He is with three of the fairest
   ornament"--knowledge, benevolence, and authority of utterance;--with
   knowledge, for He is the paternal wisdom: "All Wisdom is from the Lord,
   and with Him for evermore;"--with authority of utterance, for He is God
   and Creator: "For all things were made by Him, and without Him was not
   anything made;" [1294] --and with benevolence, for He alone gave
   Himself a sacrifice for us: "For the good Shepherd giveth His life for
   the sheep;" [1295] and He has so given it. Now, benevolence is nothing
   but wishing to do good to one's neighbour for his sake.

      Chapter XII.--The Instructor Characterized by the Severity and Benignity
      of Paternal Affection.

   Having now accomplished those things, it were a fitting sequel that our
   instructor Jesus should draw for us the model of the true life, and
   train humanity in Christ.

   Nor is the cast and character of the life He enjoins very formidable;
   nor is it made altogether easy by reason of His benignity. He enjoins
   His commands, and at the same time gives them such a character that
   they may be accomplished.

   The view I take is, that He Himself formed man of the dust, and
   regenerated him by water; and made him grow by his Spirit; and trained
   him by His word to adoption and salvation, directing him by sacred
   precepts; in order that, transforming earth-born man into a holy and
   heavenly being by His advent, He might fulfil to the utmost that divine
   utterance, "Let Us make man in Our own image and likeness." [1296] And,
   in truth, Christ became the perfect realization of what God spake; and
   the rest of humanity is conceived as being created merely in His image.

   But let us, O children of the good Father--nurslings of the good
   Instructor--fulfil the Father's will, listen to the Word, and take on
   the impress of the truly saving life of our Saviour; and meditating on
   the heavenly mode of life according to which we have been deified, let
   us anoint ourselves with the perennial immortal bloom of gladness--that
   ointment of sweet fragrance--having a clear example of immortality in
   the walk and conversation of the Lord; and following the footsteps of
   God, to whom alone it belongs to consider, and whose care it is to see
   to, the way and manner in which the life of men may be made more
   healthy. Besides, He makes preparation for a self-sufficing mode of
   life, for simplicity, and for girding up our loins, and for free and
   unimpeded readiness of our journey; in order to the attainment of an
   eternity of beatitude, teaching each one of us to be his own
   storehouse. For He says, "Take no anxious thought for to-morrow,"
   [1297] meaning that the man who has devoted himself to Christ ought to
   be sufficient to himself, and servant to himself, and moreover lead a
   life which provides for each day by itself. For it is not in war, but
   in peace, that we are trained. War needs great preparation, and luxury
   craves profusion; but peace and love, simple and quiet sisters, require
   no arms nor excessive preparation. The Word is their sustenance.

   Our superintendence in instruction and discipline is the office of the
   Word, from whom we learn frugality and humility, and all that pertains
   to love of truth, love of man, and love of excellence. And so, in a
   word, being assimilated to God by a participation in moral excellence,
   we must not retrograde into carelessness and sloth. But labour, and
   faint not. Thou shalt be what thou dost not hope, and canst not
   conjecture. And as there is one mode of training for philosophers,
   another for orators, and another for athletes; so is there a generous
   disposition, suitable to the choice that is set upon moral loveliness,
   resulting from the training of Christ. And in the case of those who
   have been trained according to this influence, their gait in walking,
   their sitting at table, their food, their sleep, their going to bed,
   their regimen, and the rest of their mode of life, acquire a superior
   dignity. [1298] For such a training as is pursued by the Word is not
   overstrained, but is of the right tension. Thus, therefore, the Word
   has been called also the Saviour, seeing He has found out for men those
   rational medicines which produce vigour of the senses and salvation;
   and devotes Himself to watching for the favourable moment, reproving
   evil, exposing the causes of evil affections, and striking at the roots
   of irrational lusts, pointing out what we ought to abstain from, and
   supplying all the antidotes of salvation to those who are diseased. For
   the greatest and most regal work of God is the salvation of humanity.
   The sick are vexed at a physician, who gives no advice bearing on their
   restoration to health. But how shall we not acknowledge the highest
   gratitude to the divine Instructor, who is not silent, who omits not
   those threatenings that point towards destruction, but discloses them,
   and cuts off the impulses that tend to them; and who indoctrinates in
   those counsels which result in the true way of living? We must confess,
   therefore, the deepest obligations to Him. For what else do we say is
   incumbent on the rational creature--I mean man--than the contemplation
   of the Divine? I say, too, that it is requisite to contemplate human
   nature, and to live as the truth directs, and to admire the Instructor
   and His injunctions, as suitable and harmonious to each other.
   According to which image also we ought, conforming ourselves to the
   Instructor, and making the word and our deeds agree, to live a real
   life.

      Chapter XIII.--Virtue Rational, Sin Irrational.

   Everything that is contrary to right reason is sin. Accordingly,
   therefore, the philosophers think fit to define the most generic
   passions thus: lust, as desire disobedient to reason; fear, as weakness
   disobedient to reason; pleasure, as an elation of the spirit
   disobedient to reason. If, then, disobedience in reference to reason is
   the generating cause of sin, how shall we escape the conclusion, that
   obedience to reason--the Word--which we call faith, will of necessity
   be the efficacious cause of duty? For virtue itself is a state of the
   soul rendered harmonious by reason in respect to the whole life. Nay,
   to crown all, philosophy itself is pronounced to be the cultivation of
   right reason; so that, necessarily, whatever is done through error of
   reason is transgression, and is rightly called, (hamartema) sin. Since,
   then, the first man sinned and disobeyed God, it is said, "And man
   became like to the beasts:" [1299] being rightly regarded as
   irrational, he is likened to the beasts. Whence Wisdom says: "The horse
   for covering; the libidinous and the adulterer is become like to an
   irrational beast." [1300] Wherefore also it is added: "He neighs,
   whoever may be sitting on him." The man, it is meant, no longer speaks;
   for he who transgresses against reason is no longer rational, but an
   irrational animal, given up to lusts by which he is ridden (as a horse
   by his rider).

   But that which is done right, in obedience to reason, the followers of
   the Stoics call prosekon and kathekon, that is, incumbent and fitting.
   What is fitting is incumbent. And obedience is founded on commands. And
   these being, as they are, the same as counsel--having truth for their
   aim, train up to the ultimate goal of aspiration, which is conceived of
   as the end (telos). And the end of piety is eternal rest in God. And
   the beginning of eternity is our end. The right operation of piety
   perfects duty by works; whence, according to just reasoning, duties
   consist in actions, not in sayings. And Christian conduct is the
   operation of the rational soul in accordance with a correct judgment
   and aspiration after the truth, which attains its destined end through
   the body, the soul's consort and ally. [1301] Virtue is a will in
   conformity to God and Christ in life, rightly adjusted to life
   everlasting. For the life of Christians, in which we are now trained,
   is a system of reasonable actions--that is, of those things taught by
   the Word--an unfailing energy which we have called faith. The system is
   the commandments of the Lord, which, being divine statutes and
   spiritual counsels, have been written for ourselves, being adapted for
   ourselves and our neighbours. Moreover, they turn back on us, as the
   ball rebounds on him that throws it by the repercussion. Whence also
   duties are essential for divine discipline, as being enjoined by God,
   and furnished for our salvation. And since, of those things which are
   necessary, some relate only to life here, and others, which relate to
   the blessed life yonder, wing us for flight hence; so, in an analogous
   manner, of duties, some are ordained with reference to life, others for
   the blessed life. The commandments issued with respect to natural life
   are published to the multitude; but those that are suited for living
   well, and from which eternal life springs, we have to consider, as in a
   sketch, as we read them out of the Scriptures.

      Chap. I.--On Eating.

   Keeping, then, to our aim, and selecting the Scriptures which bear on
   the usefulness of training for life, we must now compendiously describe
   what the man who is called a Christian ought to be during the whole of
   his life. We must accordingly begin with ourselves, and how we ought to
   regulate ourselves. We have therefore, preserving a due regard to the
   symmetry of this work, to say how each of us ought to conduct himself
   in respect to his body, or rather how to regulate the body itself. For
   whenever any one, who has been brought away by the Word from external
   things, and from attention to the body itself to the mind, acquires a
   clear view of what happens according to nature in man, he will know
   that he is not to be earnestly occupied about external things, but
   about what is proper and peculiar to man--to purge the eye of the soul,
   and to sanctify also his flesh. For he that is clean rid of those
   things which constitute him still dust, what else has he more
   serviceable than himself for walking in the way which leads to the
   comprehension of God.

   Some men, in truth, live that they may eat, as the irrational
   creatures, "whose life is their belly, and nothing else." But the
   Instructor enjoins us to eat that we may live. For neither is food our
   business, nor is pleasure our aim; but both are on account of our life
   here, which the Word is training up to immortality. Wherefore also
   there is discrimination to be employed in reference to food. And it is
   to be simple, truly plain, suiting precisely simple and artless
   children--as ministering to life, not to luxury. And the life to which
   it conduces consists of two things--health and strength; to which
   plainness of fare is most suitable, being conducive both to digestion
   and lightness of body, from which come growth, and health, and right
   strength, not strength that is wrong or dangerous and wretched, as is
   that of athletes produced by compulsory feeding.

   We must therefore reject different varieties, which engender various
   mischiefs, such as a depraved habit of body and disorders of the
   stomach, the taste being vitiated by an unhappy art--that of cookery,
   and the useless art of making pastry. For people dare to call by the
   name of food their dabbling in luxuries, which glides into mischievous
   pleasures. Antiphanes, the Delian physician, said that this variety of
   viands was the one cause of disease; there being people who dislike the
   truth, and through various absurd notions abjure moderation of diet,
   and put themselves to a world of trouble to procure dainties from
   beyond seas.

   For my part, I am sorry for this disease, while they are not ashamed to
   sing the praises of their delicacies, giving themselves great trouble
   to get lampreys in the Straits of Sicily, the eels of the Mæander, and
   the kids found in Melos, and the mullets in Sciathus, and the mussels
   of Pelorus, the oysters of Abydos, not omitting the sprats found in
   Lipara, and the Mantinican turnip; and furthermore, the beetroot that
   grows among the Ascræans: they seek out the cockles of Methymna, the
   turbots of Attica, and the thrushes of Daphnis, and the reddish-brown
   dried figs, on account of which the ill-starred Persian marched into
   Greece with five hundred thousand men. Besides these, they purchase
   birds from Phasis, the Egyptian snipes, and the Median peafowl.
   Altering these by means of condiments, the gluttons gape for the
   sauces. "Whatever earth and the depths of the sea, and the unmeasured
   space of the air produce," they cater for their gluttony. In their
   greed and solicitude, the gluttons seem absolutely to sweep the world
   with a drag-net to gratify their luxurious tastes. These gluttons,
   surrounded with the sound of hissing frying-pans, and wearing their
   whole life away at the pestle and mortar, cling to matter like fire.
   More than that, they emasculate plain food, namely bread, by straining
   off the nourishing part of the grain, so that the necessary part of
   food becomes matter of reproach to luxury. There is no limit to
   epicurism among men. For it has driven them to sweetmeats, and
   honey-cakes, and sugar-plums; inventing a multitude of desserts,
   hunting after all manner of dishes. A man like this seems to me to be
   all jaw, and nothing else. "Desire not," says the Scripture, "rich
   men's dainties;" [1302] for they belong to a false and base life. They
   partake of luxurious dishes, which a little after go to the dunghill.
   But we who seek the heavenly bread must rule the belly, which is
   beneath heaven, and much more the things which are agreeable to it,
   which "God shall destroy," [1303] says the apostle, justly execrating
   gluttonous desires. For "meats are for the belly," [1304] for on them
   depends this truly carnal and destructive life; whence [1305] some,
   speaking with unbridled tongue, dare to apply the name agape, [1306] to
   pitiful suppers, redolent of savour and sauces. Dishonouring the good
   and saving work of the Word, the consecrated agape, with pots and
   pouring of sauce; and by drink and delicacies and smoke desecrating
   that name, they are deceived in their idea, having expected that the
   promise of God might be bought with suppers. Gatherings for the sake of
   mirth, and such entertainments as are called by ourselves, we name
   rightly suppers, dinners, and banquets, after the example of the Lord.
   But such entertainments the Lord has not called agapæ. He says
   accordingly somewhere, "When thou art called to a wedding, recline not
   on the highest couch; but when thou art called, fall into the lowest
   place;" [1307] and elsewhere, "When thou makest a dinner or a supper;"
   and again, "But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor,"
   [1308] for whose sake chiefly a supper ought to be made. And further,
   "A certain man made a great supper, and called many." [1309] But I
   perceive whence the specious appellation of suppers flowed: "from the
   gullets and furious love for suppers"--according to the comic poet.
   For, in truth, "to many, many things are on account of the supper." For
   they have not yet learned that God has provided for His creature (man I
   mean) food and drink, for sustenance, not for pleasure; since the body
   derives no advantage from extravagance in viands. For, quite the
   contrary, those who use the most frugal fare are the strongest and the
   healthiest, and the noblest; as domestics are healthier and stronger
   than their masters, and husbandmen than the proprietors; and not only
   more robust, but wiser, as philosophers are wiser than rich men. For
   they have not buried the mind beneath food, nor deceived it with
   pleasures. But love (agape) is in truth celestial food, the banquet of
   reason. "It beareth all things, endureth all things, hopeth all things.
   Love never faileth." [1310] "Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the
   kingdom of God." [1311] But the hardest of all cases is for charity,
   which faileth not, to be cast from heaven above to the ground into the
   midst of sauces. And do you imagine that I am thinking of a supper that
   is to be done away with? "For if," it is said, "I bestow all my goods,
   and have not love, I am nothing." [1312] On this love alone depend the
   law and the Word; and if "thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy
   neighbour," this is the celestial festival in the heavens. But the
   earthly is called a supper, as has been shown from Scripture. For the
   supper is made for love, but the supper is not love (agape); only a
   proof of mutual and reciprocal kindly feeling. "Let not, then, your
   good be evil spoken of; for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink,"
   says the apostle, in order that the meal spoken of may not be conceived
   as ephemeral, "but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy
   Ghost." [1313] He who eats of this meal, the best of all, shall possess
   the kingdom of God, fixing his regards here on the holy assembly of
   love, the heavenly Church. Love, then, is something pure and worthy of
   God, and its work is communication. "And the care of discipline is
   love," as Wisdom says; "and love is the keeping of the law." [1314] And
   these joys have an inspiration of love from the public nutriment, which
   accustoms to everlasting dainties. Love (agape), then, is not a supper.
   But let the entertainment depend on love. For it is said, "Let the
   children whom Thou hast loved, O Lord, learn that it is not the
   products of fruits that nourish man; but it is Thy word which preserves
   those who believe on Thee." [1315] "For the righteous shall not live by
   bread." [1316] But let our diet be light and digestible, and suitable
   for keeping awake, unmixed with diverse varieties. Nor is this a point
   which is beyond the sphere of discipline. For love is a good nurse for
   communication; having as its rich provision sufficiency, which,
   presiding over diet measured in due quantity, and treating the body in
   a healthful way, distributes something from its resources to those near
   us. But the diet which exceeds sufficiency injures a man, deteriorates
   his spirit, and renders his body prone to disease. Besides, those
   dainty tastes, which trouble themselves about rich dishes, drive to
   practices of ill-repute, daintiness, gluttony, greed, voracity,
   insatiability. Appropriate designations of such people as so indulge
   are flies, weasels, flatterers, gladiators, and the monstrous tribes of
   parasites--the one class surrendering reason, the other friendship, and
   the other life, for the gratification of the belly; crawling on their
   bellies, beasts in human shape after the image of their father, the
   voracious beast. People first called the abandoned asotous, and so
   appear to me to indicate their end, understanding them as those who are
   (asostous) unsaved, excluding the s. For those that are absorbed in
   pots, and exquisitely prepared niceties of condiments, are they not
   plainly abject, earth-born, leading an ephemeral kind of life, as if
   they were not to live [hereafter]? Those the Holy Spirit, by Isaiah,
   denounces as wretched, depriving them tacitly of the name of love
   (agape), since their feasting was not in accordance with the word. "But
   they made mirth, killing calves, and sacrificing sheep, saying, Let us
   eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." And that He reckons such luxury
   to be sin, is shown by what He adds, "And your sin shall not be
   forgiven you till you die," [1317] --not conveying the idea that death,
   which deprives of sensation, is the forgiveness of sin, but meaning
   that death of salvation which is the recompense of sin. "Take no
   pleasure in abominable delicacies, says Wisdom. [1318] At this point,
   too, we have to advert to what are called things sacrificed to idols,
   in order to show how we are enjoined to abstain from them. Polluted and
   abominable those things seem to me, to the blood of which, fly


   "Souls from Erebus of inanimate corpses." [1319]

   "For I would not that ye should have fellowship with demons," [1320]
   says the apostle; since the food of those who are saved and those who
   perish is separate. We must therefore abstain from these viands not for
   fear (because there is no power in them); but on account of our
   conscience, which is holy, and out of detestation of the demons to
   which they are dedicated, are we to loathe them; and further, on
   account of the instability of those who regard many things in a way
   that makes them prone to fall, "whose conscience, being weak, is
   defiled: for meat commendeth us not to God." [1321] "For it is not that
   which entereth in that defileth a man, but that which goeth out of his
   mouth." [1322] The natural use of food is then indifferent. "For
   neither if we eat are we the better," it is said, "nor if we eat not
   are we the worse." [1323] But it is inconsistent with reason, for those
   that have been made worthy to share divine and spiritual food, to
   partake of the tables of demons. "Have we not power to eat and to
   drink," says the apostle, "and to lead about wives?" But by keeping
   pleasures under command we prevent lusts. See, then, that this power of
   yours never "become a stumbling-block to the weak."

   For it were not seemly that we, after the fashion of the rich man's son
   in the Gospel, [1324] should, as prodigals, abuse the Father's gifts;
   but we should use them, without undue attachment to them, as having
   command over ourselves. For we are enjoined to reign and rule over
   meats, not to be slaves to them. It is an admirable thing, therefore,
   to raise our eyes aloft to what is true, to depend on that divine food
   above, and to satiate ourselves with the exhaustless contemplation of
   that which truly exists, and so taste of the only sure and pure
   delight. For such is the agape, which, the food that comes from Christ
   shows that we ought to partake of. But totally irrational, futile, and
   not human is it for those that are of the earth, fattening themselves
   like cattle, to feed themselves up for death; looking downwards on the
   earth, and bending ever over tables; leading a life of gluttony;
   burying all the good of existence here in a life that by and by will
   end; courting voracity alone, in respect to which cooks are held in
   higher esteem than husbandmen. For we do not abolish social
   intercourse, but look with suspicion on the snares of custom, and
   regard them as a calamity. Wherefore daintiness is to be shunned, and
   we are to partake of few and necessary things. "And if one of the
   unbelievers call us to a feast, and we determine to go" (for it is a
   good thing not to mix with the dissolute), the apostle bids us "eat
   what is set before us, asking no questions for conscience sake." [1325]
   Similarly he has enjoined to purchase "what is sold in the shambles,"
   without curious questioning. [1326]

   We are not, then, to abstain wholly from various kinds of food, but
   only are not to be taken up about them. We are to partake of what is
   set before us, as becomes a Christian, out of respect to him who has
   invited us, by a harmless and moderate participation in the social
   meeting; regarding the sumptuousness of what is put on the table as a
   matter of indifference, despising the dainties, as after a little
   destined to perish. "Let him who eateth, not despise him who eateth
   not; and let him who eateth not, not judge him who eateth." [1327] And
   a little way on he explains the reason of the command, when he says,
   "He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, and giveth God thanks; and he that
   eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks." [1328]
   So that the right food is thanksgiving. And he who gives thanks does
   not occupy his time in pleasures. And if we would persuade any of our
   fellow-guests to virtue, we are all the more on this account to abstain
   from those dainty dishes; and so exhibit ourselves as a bright pattern
   of virtue, such as we ourselves have in Christ. "For if any of such
   meats make a brother to stumble, I shall not eat it as long as the
   world lasts," says he, "that I may not make my brother stumble." [1329]
   I gain the man by a little self-restraint. "Have we not power to eat
   and to drink?" [1330] And "we know"--he says the truth--"that an idol
   is nothing in the world; but we have only one true God, of whom are all
   things, and one Lord Jesus. But," he says, "through thy knowledge thy
   weak brother perishes, for whom Christ died; and they that wound the
   conscience of the weak brethren sin against Christ." [1331] Thus the
   apostle, in his solicitude for us, discriminates in the case of
   entertainments, saying, that "if any one called a brother be found a
   fornicator, or an adulterer, or an idolater, with such an one not to
   eat;" [1332] neither in discourse or food are we to join, looking with
   suspicion on the pollution thence proceeding, as on the tables of the
   demons. "It is good, then, neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine,"
   [1333] as both he and the Pythagoreans acknowledge. For this is rather
   characteristic of a beast; and the fumes arising from them being dense,
   darken the soul. If one partakes of them, he does not sin. Only let him
   partake temperately, not dependent on them, nor gaping after fine fare.
   For a voice will whisper to him, saying, "Destroy not the work of God
   for the sake of food." [1334] For it is the mark of a silly mind to be
   amazed and stupefied at what is presented at vulgar banquets, after the
   rich fare which is in the Word; and much sillier to make one's eyes the
   slaves of the delicacies, so that one's greed is, so to speak, carried
   round by the servants. And how foolish for people to raise themselves
   on the couches, all but pitching their faces into the dishes,
   stretching out from the couch as from a nest, according to the common
   saying, "that they may catch the wandering steam by breathing it in!"
   And how senseless, to besmear their hands with the condiments, and to
   be constantly reaching to the sauce, cramming themselves immoderately
   and shamelessly, not like people tasting, but ravenously seizing! For
   you may see such people, liker swine or dogs for gluttony than men, in
   such a hurry to feed themselves full, that both jaws are stuffed out at
   once, the veins about the face raised, and besides, the perspiration
   running all over, as they are tightened with their insatiable greed,
   and panting with their excess; the food pushed with unsocial eagerness
   into their stomach, as if they were stowing away their victuals for
   provision for a journey, not for digestion. Excess, which in all things
   is an evil, is very highly reprehensible in the matter of food.
   Gluttony, called opsophagia, is nothing but excess in the use of
   relishes (opson); and laimargia is insanity with respect to the gullet;
   and gastrimargia is excess with respect to food--insanity in reference
   to the belly, as the name implies; for margos is a madman. The apostle,
   checking those that transgress in their conduct at entertainments,
   [1335] says: "For every one taketh beforehand in eating his own supper;
   and one is hungry, and another drunken. Have ye not houses to eat and
   to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God, and shame those who have
   not?" [1336] And among those who have, they, who eat shamelessly and
   are insatiable, shame themselves. And both act badly; the one by
   paining those who have not, the other by exposing their own greed in
   the presence of those who have. Necessarily, therefore, against those
   who have cast off shame and unsparingly abuse meals, the insatiable to
   whom nothing is sufficient, the apostle, in continuation, again breaks
   forth in a voice of displeasure: "So that, my brethren, when ye come
   together to eat, wait for one another. And if any one is hungry, let
   him eat at home, that ye come not together to condemnation." [1337]

   From all slavish habits [1338] and excess we must abstain, and touch
   what is set before us in a decorous way; keeping the hand and couch and
   chin free of stains; preserving the grace of the countenance
   undisturbed, and committing no indecorum in the act of swallowing; but
   stretching out the hand at intervals in an orderly manner. We must
   guard against speaking anything while eating: for the voice becomes
   disagreeable and inarticulate when it is confined by full jaws; and the
   tongue, pressed by the food and impeded in its natural energy, gives
   forth a compressed utterance. Nor is it suitable to eat and to drink
   simultaneously. For it is the very extreme of intemperance to confound
   the times whose uses are discordant. And "whether ye eat or drink, do
   all to the glory of God," [1339] aiming after true frugality, which the
   Lord also seems to me to have hinted at when He blessed the loaves and
   the cooked fishes with which He feasted the disciples, introducing a
   beautiful example of simple food. That fish then which, at the command
   of the Lord, Peter caught, points to digestible and God-given and
   moderate food. And by those who rise from the water to the bait of
   righteousness, He admonishes us to take away luxury and avarice, as the
   coin from the fish; in order that He might displace vainglory; and by
   giving the stater to the tax-gatherers, and "rendering to Cæsar the
   things which are Cæsar's," might preserve "to God the things which are
   God's." [1340] The stater is capable of other explanations not unknown
   to us, but the present is not a suitable occasion for their treatment.
   Let the mention we make for our present purpose suffice, as it is not
   unsuitable to the flowers of the Word; and we have often done this,
   drawing to the urgent point of the question the most beneficial
   fountain, in order to water those who have been planted by the Word.
   "For if it is lawful for me to partake of all things, yet all things
   are not expedient." [1341] For those that do all that is lawful,
   quickly fall into doing what is unlawful. And just as righteousness is
   not attained by avarice, nor temperance by excess; so neither is the
   regimen of a Christian formed by indulgence; for the table of truth is
   far from lascivious dainties. For though it was chiefly for men's sake
   that all things were made, yet it is not good to use all things, nor at
   all times. For the occasion, and the time, and the mode, and the
   intention, materially turn the balance with reference to what is
   useful, in the view of one who is rightly instructed; and this is
   suitable, and has influence in putting a stop to a life of gluttony,
   which wealth is prone to choose, not that wealth which sees clearly,
   but that abundance which makes a man blind with reference to gluttony.
   No one is poor as regards necessaries, and a man is never overlooked.
   For there is one God who feeds the fowls and the fishes, and, in a
   word, the irrational creatures; and not one thing whatever is wanting
   to them, though "they take no thought for their food." [1342] And we
   are better than they, being their lords, and more closely allied to
   God, as being wiser; and we were made, not that we might eat and drink,
   but that we might devote ourselves to the knowledge of God. "For the
   just man who eats is satisfied in his soul, but the belly of the wicked
   shall want," [1343] filled with the appetites of insatiable gluttony.
   Now lavish expense is adapted not for enjoyment alone, but also for
   social communication. Wherefore we must guard against those articles of
   food which persuade us to eat when we are not hungry, bewitching the
   appetite. For is there not within a temperate simplicity a wholesome
   variety of eatables? Bulbs, [1344] olives, certain herbs, milk, cheese,
   fruits, all kinds of cooked food without sauces; and if flesh is
   wanted, let roast rather than boiled be set down. Have you anything to
   eat here? said the Lord [1345] to the disciples after the resurrection;
   and they, as taught by Him to practice frugality, "gave Him a piece of
   broiled fish;" and having eaten before them, says Luke, He spoke to
   them what He spoke. And in addition to these, it is not to be
   overlooked that those who feed according to the Word are not debarred
   from dainties in the shape of honey-combs. For of articles of food,
   those are the most suitable which are fit for immediate use without
   fire, since they are readiest; and second to these are those which are
   simplest, as we said before. But those who bend around inflammatory
   tables, nourishing their own diseases, are ruled by a most lickerish
   demon, whom I shall not blush to call the Belly-demon, and the worst
   and most abandoned of demons. He is therefore exactly like the one who
   is called the Ventriloquist-demon. It is far better to be happy [1346]
   than to have a demon dwelling with us. And happiness is found in the
   practice of virtue. Accordingly, the apostle Matthew partook of seeds,
   and nuts, [1347] and vegetables, without flesh. And John, who carried
   temperance to the extreme, "ate locusts and wild honey." Peter
   abstained from swine; "but a trance fell on him," as is written in the
   Acts of the Apostles, "and he saw heaven opened, and a vessel let down
   on the earth by the four corners, and all the four-looted beasts and
   creeping things of the earth and the fowls of heaven in it; and there
   came a voice to him, Rise, and slay, and eat. And Peter said, Not so,
   Lord, for I have never eaten what is common or unclean. And the voice
   came again to him the second time, What God hath cleansed, call not
   thou common." [1348] The use of them is accordingly indifferent to us.
   "For not what entereth into the mouth defileth the man," [1349] but the
   vain opinion respecting uncleanness. For God, when He created man,
   said, "All things shall be to you for meat." [1350] "And herbs, with
   love, are better than a calf with fraud." [1351] This well reminds us
   of what was said above, that herbs are not love, but that our meals are
   to be taken with love; [1352] and in these the medium state is good. In
   all things, indeed, this is the case, and not least in the preparation
   made for feasting, since the extremes are dangerous, and middle courses
   good. And to be in no want of necessaries is the medium. For the
   desires which are in accordance with nature are bounded by sufficiency.
   The Jews had frugality enjoined on them by the law in the most
   systematic manner. For the Instructor, by Moses, deprived them of the
   use of innumerable things, adding reasons--the spiritual ones hidden;
   the carnal ones apparent, to which indeed they have trusted; in the
   case of some animals, because they did not part the hoof, and others
   because they did not ruminate their food, and others because alone of
   aquatic animals they were devoid of scales; so that altogether but a
   few were left appropriate for their food. And of those that he
   permitted them to touch, he prohibited such as had died, or were
   offered to idols, or had been strangled; for to touch these was
   unlawful. For since it is impossible for those who use dainties to
   abstain from partaking of them, he appointed the opposite mode of life,
   till he should break down the propensity to indulgence arising from
   habit. Pleasure has often produced in men harm and pain; and full
   feeding begets in the soul uneasiness, and forgetfulness, and
   foolishness. And they say that the bodies of children, when shooting up
   to their height, are made to grow right by deficiency in nourishment.
   For then the spirit, which pervades the body in order to its growth, is
   not checked by abundance of food obstructing the freedom of its course.
   Whence that truth-seeking philosopher Plato, fanning the spark of the
   Hebrew philosophy when condemning a life of luxury, says: "On my coming
   hither, the life which is here called happy, full of Italian and
   Syracusan tables, pleased me not by any means, [consisting as it did]
   in being filled twice a day, and never sleeping by night alone, and
   whatever other accessories attend the mode of life. For not one man
   under heaven, if brought up from his youth in such practices, will ever
   turn out a wise man, with however admirable a natural genius he may be
   endowed." For Plato was not unacquainted with David, who "placed the
   sacred ark in his city in the midst of the tabernacle;" and bidding all
   his subjects rejoice "before the Lord, divided to the whole host of
   Israel, man and woman, to each a loaf of bread, and baked bread, and a
   cake from the frying-pan." [1353]

   This was the sufficient sustenance of the Israelites. But that of the
   Gentiles was over-abundant. No one who uses it will ever study to
   become temperate, burying as he does his mind in his belly, very like
   the fish called ass, [1354] which, Aristotle says, alone of all
   creatures has its heart in its stomach. This fish Epicharmus the comic
   poet calls "monster-paunch."

   Such are the men who believe in their belly, "whose God is their belly,
   whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things." To them the
   apostle predicted no good when he said, "whose end is destruction."

      Chapter II.--On Drinking.

   "Use a little wine," says the apostle to Timothy, who drank water, "for
   thy stomach's sake;" [1356] most properly applying its aid as a
   strengthening tonic suitable to a sickly body enfeebled with watery
   humours; and specifying "a little," lest the remedy should, on account
   of its quantity, unobserved, create the necessity of other treatment.

   The natural, temperate, and necessary beverage, therefore, for the
   thirsty is water. [1357] This was the simple drink of sobriety, which,
   flowing from the smitten rock, was supplied by the Lord to the ancient
   Hebrews. [1358] It was most requisite that in their wanderings they
   should be temperate. [1359]

   Afterwards the sacred vine produced the prophetic cluster. This was a
   sign to them, when trained from wandering to their rest; representing
   the great cluster the Word, bruised for us. For the blood of the
   grape--that is, the Word--desired to be mixed with water, as His blood
   is mingled with salvation.

   And the blood of the Lord is twofold. For there is the blood of His
   flesh, by which we are redeemed from corruption; and the spiritual,
   that by which we are anointed. And to drink the blood of Jesus, is to
   become partaker of the Lord's immortality; the Spirit being the
   energetic principle of the Word, as blood is of flesh. [1360]

   Accordingly, as wine is blended with water, [1361] so is the Spirit
   with man. And the one, the mixture of wine and water, nourishes to
   faith; while the other, the Spirit, conducts to immortality.

   And the mixture of both--of the water and of the Word--is called
   Eucharist, renowned and glorious grace; and they who by faith partake
   of it are sanctified both in body and soul. For the divine mixture,
   man, the Father's will has mystically compounded by the Spirit and the
   Word. For, in truth, the spirit is joined to the soul, which is
   inspired by it; and the flesh, by reason of which the Word became
   flesh, to the Word.

   I therefore admire those who have adopted an austere life, and who are
   fond of water, the medicine of temperance, and flee as far as possible
   from wine, shunning it as they would the danger of fire. [1362] It is
   proper, therefore, that boys and girls should keep as much as possible
   away from this medicine. For it is not right to pour into the burning
   season of life the hottest of all liquids--wine--adding, as it were,
   fire to fire. [1363] For hence wild impulses and burning lusts and
   fiery habits are kindled; and young men inflamed from within become
   prone to the indulgence of vicious propensities; so that signs of
   injury appear in their body, the members of lust coming to maturity
   sooner than they ought. The breasts and organs of generation, inflamed
   with wine, expand and swell in a shameful way, already exhibiting
   beforehand the image of fornication; and the body compels the wound of
   the soul to inflame, and shameless pulsations follow abundance,
   inciting the man of correct behaviour to transgression; and hence the
   voluptuousness of youth overpasses the bounds of modesty. And we must,
   as far as possible, try to quench the impulses of youth by removing the
   Bacchic fuel of the threatened danger; and by pouring the antidote to
   the inflammation, so keep down the burning soul, and keep in the
   swelling members, and allay the agitation of lust when it is already in
   commotion. And in the case of grown-up people, let those with whom it
   agrees sometimes partake of dinner, tasting bread only, and let them
   abstain wholly from drink; in order that their superfluous moisture may
   be absorbed and drunk up by the eating of dry food. For constant
   spitting and wiping off perspiration, and hastening to evacuations, is
   the sign of excess, from the immoderate use of liquids supplied in
   excessive quantity to the body. And if thirst come on, let the appetite
   be satisfied with a little water. For it is not proper that water
   should be supplied in too great profusion; in order that the food may
   not be drowned, but ground down in order to digestion; and this takes
   place when the victuals are collected into a mass, and only a small
   portion is evacuated.

   And, besides, it suits divine studies not to be heavy with wine. "For
   unmixed wine is far from compelling a man to be wise, much less
   temperate," according to the comic poet. But towards evening, about
   supper-time, wine may be used, when we are no longer engaged in more
   serious readings. Then also the air becomes colder than it is during
   the day; so that the failing natural warmth requires to be nourished by
   the introduction of heat. But even then it must only be a little wine
   that is to be used; for we must not go on to intemperate potations.
   Those who are already advanced in life may partake more cheerfully of
   the draught, to warm by the harmless medicine of the vine the chill of
   age, which the decay of time has produced. For old men's passions are
   not, for the most part, stirred to such agitation as to drive them to
   the shipwreck of drunkenness. For being moored by reason and time, as
   by anchors, they stand with greater ease the storm of passions which
   rushes down from intemperance. They also may be permitted to indulge in
   pleasantry at feasts. But to them also let the limit of their potations
   be the point up to which they keep their reason unwavering, their
   memory active, and their body unmoved and unshaken by wine. People in
   such a state are called by those who are skilful in these matters,
   acrothorakes. [1364] It is well, therefore, to leave off betimes, for
   fear of tripping.

   One Artorius, in his book On Long Life (for so I remember), thinks that
   drink should be taken only till the food be moistened, that we may
   attain to a longer life. It is fitting, then, that some apply wine by
   way of physic, for the sake of health alone, and others for purposes of
   relaxation and enjoyment. For first wine makes the man who has drunk it
   more benignant than before, more agreeable to his boon companions,
   kinder to his domestics, and more pleasant to his friends. But when
   intoxicated, he becomes violent instead. For wine being warm, and
   having sweet juices when duly mixed, dissolves the foul excrementitious
   matters by its warmth, and mixes the acrid and base humours with the
   agreeable scents.

   It has therefore been well said, "A joy of the soul and heart was wine
   created from the beginning, when drunk in moderate sufficiency." [1365]
   And it is best to mix the wine with as much water as possible, and not
   to have recourse to it as to water, and so get enervated to
   drunkenness, and not pour it in as water from love of wine. For both
   are works of God; and so the mixture of both, of water and of wine,
   conduces together to health, because life consists of what is necessary
   and of what is useful. With water, then, which is the necessary of
   life, and to be used in abundance, there is also to be mixed the
   useful.

   By an immoderate quantity of wine the tongue is impeded; the lips are
   relaxed; the eyes roll wildly, the sight, as it were, swimming through
   the quantity of moisture; and compelled to deceive, they think that
   everything is revolving round them, and cannot count distant objects as
   single. "And, in truth, methinks I see two suns," [1366] said the
   Theban old man in his cups. For the sight, being disturbed by the heat
   of the wine, frequently fancies the substance of one object to be
   manifold. And there is no difference between moving the eye or the
   object seen. For both have the same effect on the sight, which, on
   account of the fluctuation, cannot accurately obtain a perception of
   the object. And the feet are carried from beneath the man as by a
   flood, and hiccuping and vomiting and maudlin nonsense follow; "for
   every intoxicated man," according to the tragedy, [1367] --


   "Is conquered by anger, and empty of sense,

   And likes to pour forth much silly speech;

   And is wont to hear unwillingly,

   What evil words he with his will hath said."

   And before tragedy, Wisdom cried, "Much wine drunk abounds in
   irritation and all manner of mistakes." [1368] Wherefore most people
   say that you ought to relax over your cups, and postpone serious
   business till morning. I however think that then especially ought
   reason to be introduced to mix in the feast, to act the part of
   director (pædagogue) to wine-drinking, lest conviviality imperceptibly
   degenerate to drunkenness. For as no sensible man ever thinks it
   requisite to shut his eyes before going to sleep, so neither can any
   one rightly wish reason to be absent from the festive board, or can
   well study to lull it asleep till business is begun. But the Word can
   never quit those who belong to Him, not even if we are asleep; for He
   ought to be invited even to our sleep. [1369] For perfect wisdom, which
   is knowledge of things divine and human, which comprehends all that
   relates to the oversight of the flock of men, becomes, in reference to
   life, art; and so, while we live, is constantly, with us, always
   accomplishing its own proper work, the product of which is a good life.

   But the miserable wretches who expel temperance from conviviality,
   think excess in drinking to be the happiest life; and their life is
   nothing but revel, debauchery, baths, excess, urinals, idleness, drink.
   You may see some of them, half-drunk, staggering, with crowns round
   their necks like wine jars, vomiting drink on one another in the name
   of good fellowship; and others, full of the effects of their debauch,
   dirty, pale in the face, livid, and still above yesterday's bout
   pouring another bout to last till next morning. It is well, my friends,
   it is well to make our acquaintance with this picture at the greatest
   possible distance from it, and to frame ourselves to what is better,
   dreading lest we also become a like spectacle and laughing-stock to
   others.

   It has been appropriately said, "As the furnace proveth the steel blade
   in the process of dipping, so wine proveth the heart of the haughty."
   [1370] A debauch is the immoderate use of wine, intoxication the
   disorder that results from such use; crapulousness (kraipale) is the
   discomfort and nausea that follow a debauch; so called from the head
   shaking (kara pallein).

   Such a life as this (if life it must be called, which is spent in
   idleness, in agitation about voluptuous indulgences, and in the
   hallucinations of debauchery) the divine Wisdom looks on with contempt,
   and commands her children, "Be not a wine-bibber, nor spend your money
   in the purchase of flesh; for every drunkard and fornicator shall come
   to beggary, and every sluggard shall be clothed in tatters and rags."
   [1371] For every one that is not awake to wisdom, but is steeped in
   wine, is a sluggard. "And the drunkard," he says, "shall be clothed in
   rags, and be ashamed of his drunkenness in the presence of onlookers."
   [1372] For the wounds of the sinner are the rents of the garment of the
   flesh, the holes made by lusts, through which the shame of the soul
   within is seen--namely sin, by reason of which it will not be easy to
   save the garment, that has been torn away all round, that has rotted
   away in many lusts, and has been rent asunder from salvation.

   So he adds these most monitory words. "Who has woes, who has clamour,
   who has contentions, who has disgusting babblings, who has unavailing
   remorse?" [1373] You see, in all his raggedness, the lover of wine, who
   despises the Word Himself, and has abandoned and given himself to
   drunkenness. You see what threatening Scripture has pronounced against
   him. And to its threatening it adds again: "Whose are red eyes? Those,
   is it not, who tarry long at their wine, and hunt out the places where
   drinking goes on?" Here he shows the lover of drink to be already dead
   to the Word, by the mention of the bloodshot eyes,--a mark which
   appears on corpses, announcing to him death in the Lord. For
   forgetfulness of the things which tend to true life turns the scale
   towards destruction. With reason therefore, the Instructor, in His
   solicitude for our salvation, forbids us, "Drink not wine to
   drunkenness." Wherefore? you will ask. Because, says He, "thy mouth
   will then speak perverse things, and thou liest down as in the heart of
   the sea, and as the steersman of a ship in the midst of huge billows."
   Hence, too, poetry comes to our help, and says:--


   "Let wine which has strength equal to fire come to men.

   Then will it agitate them, as the north or south wind agitates the
   Libyan waves."

   And further:--


   "Wine wandering in speech shows all secrets.

   Soul-deceiving wine is the ruin of those who drink it."

   And so on.

   You see the danger of shipwreck. The heart is drowned in much drink.
   The excess of drunkenness is compared to the danger of the sea, in
   which when the body has once been sunken like a ship, it descends to
   the depths of turpitude, overwhelmed in the mighty billows of wine; and
   the helmsman, the human mind, is tossed about on the surge of
   drunkenness, which swells aloft; and buried in the trough of the sea,
   is blinded by the darkness of the tempest, having drifted away from the
   haven of truth, till, dashing on the rocks beneath the sea, it
   perishes, driven by itself into voluptuous indulgences.

   With reason, therefore, the apostle enjoins, "Be not drunk with wine,
   in which there is much excess;" by the term excess (asotia) intimating
   the inconsistence of drunkenness with salvation (to asoston). For if He
   made water wine at the marriage, He did not give permission to get
   drunk. He gave life to the watery element of the meaning of the law,
   filling with His blood the doer of it who is of Adam, that is, the
   whole world; supplying piety with drink from the vine of truth, the
   mixture of the old law and of the new word, in order to the fulfilment
   of the predestined time. The Scripture, accordingly, has named wine the
   symbol of the sacred blood; [1374] but reproving the base tippling with
   the dregs of wine, it says: "Intemperate is wine, and insolent is
   drunkenness." [1375] It is agreeable, therefore, to right reason, to
   drink on account of the cold of winter, till the numbness is dispelled
   from those who are subject to feel it; and on other occasions as a
   medicine for the intestines. For, as we are to use food to satisfy
   hunger, so also are we to use drink to satisfy thirst, taking the most
   careful precautions against a slip: "for the introduction of wine is
   perilous." And thus shall our soul be pure, and dry, and luminous; and
   the soul itself is wisest and best when dry. And thus, too, is it fit
   for contemplation, and is not humid with the exhalations, that rise
   from wine, forming a mass like a cloud. We must not therefore trouble
   ourselves to procure Chian wine if it is absent, or Ariousian when it
   is not at hand. For thirst is a sensation of want, and craves means
   suitable for supplying the want, and not sumptuous liquor. Importations
   of wines from beyond seas are for an appetite enfeebled by excess,
   where the soul even before drunkenness is insane in its desires. For
   there are the fragrant Thasian wine, and the pleasant-breathing
   Lesbian, and a sweet Cretan wine, and sweet Syracusan wine, and
   Mendusian, an Egyptian wine, and the insular Naxian, the "highly
   perfumed and flavoured," [1376] another wine of the land of Italy.
   These are many names. For the temperate drinker, one wine suffices, the
   product of the cultivation of the one God. For why should not the wine
   of their own country satisfy men's desires, unless they were to import
   water also, like the foolish Persian kings? The Choaspes, a river of
   India so called, was that from which the best water for drinking--the
   Choaspian--was got. As wine, when taken, makes people lovers of it, so
   does water too. The Holy Spirit, uttering His voice by Amos, pronounces
   the rich to be wretched on account of their luxury: [1377] "Those that
   drink strained wine, and recline on an ivory couch," he says; and what
   else similar he adds by way of reproach.

   Especial regard is to be paid to decency [1378] (as the myth represents
   Athene, whoever she was, out of regard to it, giving up the pleasure of
   the flute because of the unseemliness of the sight): so that we are to
   drink without contortions of the face, not greedily grasping the cup,
   nor before drinking making the eyes roll with unseemly motion; nor from
   intemperance are we to drain the cup at a draught; nor besprinkle the
   chin, nor splash the garments while gulping down all the liquor at
   once,--our face all but filling the bowl, and drowned in it. For the
   gurgling occasioned by the drink rushing with violence, and by its
   being drawn in with a great deal of breath, as if it were being poured
   into an earthenware vessel, while the throat makes a noise through the
   rapidity of ingurgitation, is a shameful and unseemly spectacle of
   intemperance. In addition to this, eagerness in drinking is a practice
   injurious to the partaker. Do not haste to mischief, my friend. Your
   drink is not being taken from you. It is given you, and waits you. Be
   not eager to burst, by draining it down with gaping throat. Your thirst
   is satiated, even if you drink slower, observing decorum, by taking the
   beverage in small portions, in an orderly way. For that which
   intemperance greedily seizes, is not taken away by taking time.

   "Be not mighty," he says, "at wine; for wine has overcome many." [1379]
   The Scythians, the Celts, the Iberians, and the Thracians, all of them
   warlike races, are greatly addicted to intoxication, and think that it
   is an honourable, happy pursuit to engage in. But we, the people of
   peace, feasting for lawful enjoyment, not to wantonness, drink sober
   cups of friendship, that our friendships may be shown in a way truly
   appropriate to the name.

   In what manner do you think the Lord drank when He became man for our
   sakes? As shamelessly as we? Was it not with decorum and propriety? Was
   it not deliberately? For rest assured, He Himself also partook of wine;
   for He, too, was man. And He blessed the wine, saying, "Take, drink:
   this is my blood"--the blood of the vine. [1380] He figuratively calls
   the Word "shed for many, for the remission of sins"--the holy stream of
   gladness. And that he who drinks ought to observe moderation, He
   clearly showed by what He taught at feasts. For He did not teach
   affected by wine. And that it was wine which was the thing blessed, He
   showed again, when He said to His disciples, "I will not drink of the
   fruit of this vine, till I drink it with you in the kingdom of my
   Father." [1381] But that it was wine which was drunk by the Lord, He
   tells us again, when He spake concerning Himself, reproaching the Jews
   for their hardness of heart: "For the Son of man," He says, "came, and
   they say, Behold a glutton and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans."
   [1382] Let this be held fast by us against those that are called
   Encratites.

   But women, making a profession, forsooth, of aiming at the graceful,
   that their lips may not be rent apart by stretching them on broad
   drinking cups, and so widening the mouth, drinking in an unseemly way
   out of alabastra quite too narrow: in the mouth, throw back their heads
   and bare their necks indecently, as I think; and distending the throat
   in swallowing, gulp down the liquor as if to make bare all they can to
   their boon companions; and drawing hiccups like men, or rather like
   slaves, revel in luxurious riot. For nothing disgraceful is proper for
   man, who is endowed with reason; much less for woman to whom it brings
   modesty even to reflect of what nature she is.

   "An intoxicated woman is great wrath," it is said, as if a drunken
   woman were the wrath of God. Why? "Because she will not conceal her
   shame." [1383] For a woman is quickly drawn down to licentiousness, if
   she only set her choice on pleasures. And we have not prohibited
   drinking from alabastra; but we forbid studying to drink from them
   alone, as arrogant; counselling women to use with indifference what
   comes in the way, and cutting up by the roots the dangerous appetites
   that are in them. Let the rush of air, then, which regurgitates so as
   to produce hiccup, be emitted silently.

   But by no manner of means are women to be allotted to uncover and
   exhibit any part of their person, lest both fall,--the men by being
   excited to look, they by drawing on themselves the eyes of the men.

   But always must we conduct ourselves as in the Lord's presence, lest He
   say to us, as the apostle in indignation said to the Corinthians, "When
   ye come together, this is not to eat the Lord's supper." [1384]

   To me, the star called by the mathematicians Acephalus (headless),
   which is numbered before the wandering star, his head resting on his
   breast, seems to be a type of the gluttonous, the voluptuous, and those
   that are prone to drunkenness. For in such [1385] the faculty of
   reasoning is not situated in the head, but among the intestinal
   appetites, enslaved to lust and anger. For just as Elpenor broke his
   neck through intoxication, [1386] so the brain, dizzied by drunkenness,
   falls down from above, with a great fall to the liver and the heart,
   that is, to voluptuousness and anger: as the sons of the poets say
   Hephæstus was hurled by Zeus from heaven to earth. [1387] "The trouble
   of sleeplessness, and bile, and cholic, are with an insatiable man," it
   is said. [1388]

   Wherefore also Noah's intoxication was recorded in writing, that, with
   the clear and written description of his transgression before us, we
   might guard with all our might against drunkenness. For which cause
   they who covered the shame [1389] of his drunkenness are blessed by the
   Lord. The Scripture accordingly, giving a most comprehensive compend,
   has expressed all in one word: "To an instructed man sufficiency is
   wine, and he will rest in his bed." [1390]

      Chapter III.--On Costly Vessels.

   And so the use of cups made of silver and gold, and of others inlaid
   with precious stones, is out of place, being only a deception of the
   vision. For if you pour any warm liquid into them, the vessels becoming
   hot, to touch them is painful. On the other hand, if you pour in what
   is cold, the material changes its quality, injuring the mixture, and
   the rich potion is hurtful. Away, then, with Thericleian cups and
   Antigonides, and Canthari, and goblets, and Lepastæ, [1391] and the
   endless shapes of drinking vessels, and wine-coolers, and wine-pourers
   also. For, on the whole, gold and silver, both publicly and privately,
   are an invidious possession when they exceed what is necessary, seldom
   to be acquired, difficult to keep, and not adapted for use. The
   elaborate vanity, too, of vessels in glass chased, more apt to break on
   account of the art, teaching us to fear while we drink, is to be
   banished from our well-ordered constitution. And silver couches, and
   pans and vinegar-saucers, and trenchers and bowls; and besides these,
   vessels of silver and gold, some for serving food, and others for other
   uses which I am ashamed to name, of easily cleft cedar and thyine wood,
   and ebony, and tripods fashioned of ivory, and couches with silver feet
   and inlaid with ivory, and folding-doors of beds studded with gold and
   variegated with tortoise-shell, and bed-clothes of purple and other
   colours difficult to produce, proofs of tasteless luxury, cunning
   devices of envy and effeminacy,--are all to be relinquished, as having
   nothing whatever worth our pains. "For the time is short," as says the
   apostle. This then remains that we do not make a ridiculous figure, as
   some are seen in the public spectacles outwardly anointed strikingly
   for imposing effect, but wretched within. Explaining this more clearly,
   he adds, "It remains that they that have wives be as though they had
   none, and they that buy as though they possessed not." [1392] And if he
   speaks thus of marriage, in reference to which God says, "Multiply,"
   how do you not think that senseless display is by the Lord's authority
   to be banished? Wherefore also the Lord says, "Sell what thou hast, and
   give to the poor; and come, follow me." [1393]

   Follow God, stripped of arrogance, stripped of fading display,
   possessed of that which is thine, which is good, what alone cannot be
   taken away--faith towards God, confession towards Him who suffered,
   beneficence towards men, which is the most precious of possessions. For
   my part, I approve of Plato, who plainly lays it down as a law, that a
   man is not to labour for wealth of gold or silver, nor to possess a
   useless vessel which is not for some necessary purpose, and moderate;
   so that the same thing may serve for many purposes, and the possession
   of a variety of things may be done away with. Excellently, therefore,
   the Divine Scripture, addressing boasters and lovers of their own
   selves, says, "Where are the rulers of the nations, and the lords of
   the wild beasts of the earth, who sport among the birds of heaven, who
   treasured up silver and gold, in whom men trusted, and there was no end
   of their substance, who fashioned silver and gold, and were full of
   care? There is no finding of their works. They have vanished, and gone
   down to Hades." [1394] Such is the reward of display. For though such
   of us as cultivate the soil need a mattock and plough, none of us will
   make a pickaxe of silver or a sickle of gold, but we employ the
   material which is serviceable for agriculture, not what is costly. What
   prevents those who are capable of considering what is similar from
   entertaining the same sentiments with respect to household utensils, of
   which let use, not expense, be the measure? For tell me, does the
   table-knife not cut unless it be studded with silver, and have its
   handle made of ivory? Or must we forge Indian steel in order to divide
   meat, as when we call for a weapon for the fight? What if the basin be
   of earthenware? will it not receive the dirt of the hands? or the
   footpan the dirt of the foot? Will the table that is fashioned with
   ivory feet be indignant at bearing a three-halfpenny loaf? Will the
   lamp not dispense light because it is the work of the potter, not of
   the goldsmith? I affirm that truckle-beds afford no worse repose than
   the ivory couch; and the goatskin coverlet being amply sufficient to
   spread on the bed, there is no need of purple or scarlet coverings. Yet
   to condemn, notwithstanding, frugality, through the stupidity of
   luxury, the author of mischief, what a prodigious error, what senseless
   conceit! See. The Lord ate from a common bowl, and made the disciples
   recline on the grass on the ground, and washed their feet, girded with
   a linen towel--He, the lowly-minded God, and Lord of the universe. He
   did not bring down a silver foot-bath from heaven. He asked to drink of
   the Samaritan woman, who drew the water from the well in an earthenware
   vessel, not seeking regal gold, but teaching us how to quench thirst
   easily. For He made use, not extravagance His aim. And He ate and drank
   at feasts, not digging metals from the earth, nor using vessels of gold
   and silver, that is, vessels exhaling the odour of rust--such fumes as
   the rust of smoking [1395] metal gives off.

   For in fine, in food, and clothes, and vessels, and everything else
   belonging to the house, I say comprehensively, that one must follow the
   institutions of the Christian [1396] man, as is serviceable and
   suitable to one's person, age, pursuits, time of life. For it becomes
   those that are servants of one God, that their possessions and
   furniture should exhibit the tokens of one beautiful [1397] life; and
   that each individually should be seen in faith, which shows no
   difference, practising all other things which are conformable to this
   uniform mode of life, and harmonious with this one scheme.

   What we acquire without difficulty, and use with ease, we praise, keep
   easily, and communicate freely. The things which are useful are
   preferable, and consequently cheap things are better than dear. In
   fine, wealth, when not properly governed, is a stronghold of evil,
   about which many casting their eyes, they will never reach the kingdom
   of heaven, sick for the things of the world, and living proudly through
   luxury. But those who are in earnest about salvation must settle this
   beforehand in their mind, "that all that we possess is given to us for
   use, and use for sufficiency, which one may attain to by a few things."
   For silly are they who, from greed, take delight in what they have
   hoarded up. "He that gathereth wages," it is said, "gathereth into a
   bag with holes." [1398] Such is he who gathers corn and shuts it up;
   and he who giveth to no one, becomes poorer.

   It is a farce, and a thing to make one laugh outright, for men to bring
   in silver urinals and crystal vases de nuit, as they usher in their
   counsellors, and for silly rich women to get gold receptacles for
   excrements made; so that being rich, they cannot even ease themselves
   except in superb way. I would that in their whole life they deemed gold
   fit for dung.

   But now love of money is found to be the stronghold of evil, which the
   apostle says "is the root of all evils, which, while some coveted, they
   have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many
   sorrows." [1399]

   But the best riches is poverty of desires; and the true magnanimity is
   not to be proud of wealth, but to despise it. Boasting about one's
   plate is utterly base. For it is plainly wrong to care much about what
   any one who likes may buy from the market. But wisdom is not bought
   with coin of earth, nor is it sold in the market-place, but in heaven.
   And it is sold for true coin, the immortal Word, the regal gold.

      Chapter IV.--How to Conduct Ourselves at Feasts.

   Let revelry keep away from our rational entertainments, and foolish
   vigils, too, that revel in intemperance. For revelry is an inebriating
   pipe, the chain [1400] of an amatory bridge, that is, of sorrow. And
   let love, and intoxication, and senseless passions, be removed from our
   choir. Burlesque singing is the boon companion of drunkenness. A night
   spent over drink invites drunkenness, rouses lust, and is audacious in
   deeds of shame. For if people occupy their time with pipes, and
   psalteries, and choirs, and dances, and Egyptian clapping of hands, and
   such disorderly frivolities, they become quite immodest and
   intractable, beat on cymbals and drums, and make a noise on instruments
   of delusion; for plainly such a banquet, as seems to me, is a theatre
   of drunkenness. For the apostle decrees that, "putting off the works of
   darkness, we should put on the armour of light, walking honestly as in
   the day, not spending our time in rioting and drunkenness, in
   chambering and wantonness." [1401] Let the pipe be resigned to the
   shepherds, and the flute to the superstitious who are engrossed in
   idolatry. For, in truth, such instruments are to be banished from the
   temperate banquet, being more suitable to beasts than men, and the more
   irrational portion of mankind. For we have heard of stags being charmed
   by the pipe, and seduced by music into the toils, when hunted by the
   huntsmen. And when mares are being covered, a tune is played on the
   flute--a nuptial song, as it were. And every improper sight and sound,
   to speak in a word, and every shameful sensation of
   licentiousnes--which, in truth, is privation of sensation--must by all
   means be excluded; and we must be on our guard against whatever
   pleasure titillates eye and ear, and effeminates. For the various
   spells of the broken strains and plaintive numbers of the Carian muse
   corrupt men's morals, drawing to perturbation of mind, by the
   licentious and mischievous art of music. [1402]

   The Spirit, distinguishing from such revelry the divine service, sings,
   "Praise Him with the sound of trumpet;" for with sound of trumpet He
   shall raise the dead. "Praise Him on the psaltery;" for the tongue is
   the psaltery of the Lord. "And praise Him on the lyre." [1403] By the
   lyre is meant the mouth struck by the Spirit, as it were by a plectrum.
   "Praise with the timbrel and the dance," refers to the Church
   meditating on the resurrection of the dead in the resounding skin.
   "Praise Him on the chords and organ." Our body He calls an organ, and
   its nerves are the strings, by which it has received harmonious
   tension, and when struck by the Spirit, it gives forth human voices.
   "Praise Him on the clashing cymbals." He calls the tongue the cymbal of
   the mouth, which resounds with the pulsation of the lips. Therefore He
   cried to humanity, "Let every breath praise the Lord," because He cares
   for every breathing thing which He hath made. For man is truly a
   pacific instrument; while other instruments, if you investigate, you
   will find to be warlike, inflaming to lusts, or kindling up amours, or
   rousing wrath.

   In their wars, therefore, the Etruscans use the trumpet, the Arcadians
   the pipe, the Sicilians the pectides, the Cretans the lyre, the
   Lacedæmonians the flute, the Thracians the horn, the Egyptians the
   drum, and the Arabians the cymbal. The one instrument of peace, the
   Word alone by which we honour God, is what we employ. We no longer
   employ the ancient psaltery, and trumpet, and timbrel, and flute, which
   those expert in war and contemners of the fear of God were wont to make
   use of also in the choruses at their festive assemblies; that by such
   strains they might raise their dejected minds. But let our genial
   feeling in drinking be twofold, in accordance with the law. For "if
   thou shalt love the Lord thy God," and then "thy neighbour," let its
   first manifestation be towards God in thanksgiving and psalmody, and
   the second toward our neighbour in decorous fellowship. For says the
   apostle, "Let the Word of the Lord dwell in you richly." [1404] And
   this Word suits and conforms Himself to seasons, to persons, to places.

   In the present instance He is a guest with us. For the apostle adds
   again, "Teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, in psalms,
   and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to
   God." And again, "Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name
   of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and His Father." This is our
   thankful revelry. And even if you wish to sing and play to the harp or
   lyre, there is no blame. [1405] Thou shalt imitate the righteous Hebrew
   king in his thanksgiving to God. "Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous;
   praise is comely to the upright," [1406] says the prophecy. "Confess to
   the Lord on the harp; play to Him on the psaltery of ten strings. Sing
   to Him a new song." And does not the ten-stringed psaltery indicate the
   Word Jesus, who is manifested by the element of the decad? And as it is
   befitting, before partaking of food, that we should bless the Creator
   of all; so also in drinking it is suitable to praise Him on partaking
   of His creatures. [1407] For the psalm is a melodious and sober
   blessing. The apostle calls the psalm "a spiritual song." [1408]

   Finally, before partaking of sleep, it is a sacred duty to give thanks
   to God, having enjoyed His grace and love, and so go straight to sleep.
   [1409] "And confess to Him in songs of the lips," he says, "because in
   His command all His good pleasure is done, and there is no deficiency
   in His salvation." [1410]

   Further, among the ancient Greeks, in their banquets over the brimming
   cups, a song was sung called a skolion, after the manner of the Hebrew
   psalms, all together raising the pæan with the voice, and sometimes
   also taking turns in the song while they drank healths round; while
   those that were more musical than the rest sang to the lyre. But let
   amatory songs be banished far away, and let our songs be hymns to God.
   "Let them praise," it is said, "His name in the dance, and let them
   play to Him on the timbrel and psaltery." [1411] And what is the choir
   which plays? The Spirit will show thee: "Let His praise be in the
   congregation (church) of the saints; let them be joyful in their King."
   [1412] And again he adds, "The Lord will take pleasure in His people."
   [1413] For temperate harmonies [1414] are to be admitted; but we are to
   banish as far as possible from our robust mind those liquid harmonies,
   which, through pernicious arts in the modulations of tones, train to
   effeminacy and scurrility. But grave and modest strains say farewell to
   the turbulence of drunkenness. [1415] Chromatic harmonies are therefore
   to be abandoned to immodest revels, and to florid and meretricious
   music.

      Chapter V.--On Laughter.

   People who are imitators of ludicrous sensations, or rather of such as
   deserve derision, are to be driven from our polity. [1416]

   For since all forms of speech flow from mind and manners, ludicrous
   expressions could not be uttered, did they not proceed from ludicrous
   practices. For the saying, "It is not a good tree which produces
   corrupt fruit, nor a corrupt tree which produces good fruit," [1417] is
   to be applied in this case. For speech is the fruit of the mind. If,
   then, wags are to be ejected from our society, we ourselves must by no
   manner of means be allowed to stir up laughter. For it were absurd to
   be found imitators of things of which we are prohibited to be
   listeners; and still more absurd for a man to set about making himself
   a laughing-stock, that is, the butt of insult and derision. For if we
   could not endure to make a ridiculous figure, such as we see some do in
   processions, how could we with any propriety bear to have the inner man
   made a ridiculous figure of, and that to one's face? Wherefore we ought
   never of our own accord to assume a ludicrous character. And how, then,
   can we devote ourselves to being and appearing ridiculous in our
   conversation, thereby travestying speech, which is the most precious of
   all human endowments? It is therefore disgraceful to set one's self to
   do this; since the conversation of wags of this description is not fit
   for our ears, inasmuch as by the very expressions used it familiarizes
   us with shameful actions. [1418]

   Pleasantry is allowable, not waggery. Besides, even laughter must be
   kept in check; for when given vent to in the right manner it indicates
   orderliness, but when it issues differently it shows a want of
   restraint.

   For, in a word, whatever things are natural to men we must not
   eradicate from them, but rather impose on them limits and suitable
   times. For man is not to laugh on all occasions because he is a
   laughing animal, any more than the horse neighs on all occasions
   because he is a neighing animal. But as rational beings, we are to
   regulate ourselves suitably, harmoniously relaxing the austerity and
   over-tension of our serious pursuits, not inharmoniously breaking them
   up altogether.

   For the seemly relaxation of the countenance in a harmonious manner--as
   of a musical instrument--is called a smile. So also is laughter on the
   face of well-regulated men termed. But the discordant relaxation of
   countenance in the case of women is called a giggle, and is
   meretricious laughter; in the case of men, a guffaw, and is savage and
   insulting laughter. "A fool raises his voice in laughter," [1419] says
   the Scripture; but a clever man smiles almost imperceptibly. The clever
   man in this case he calls wise, inasmuch as he is differently affected
   from the fool. But, on the other hand, one needs not be gloomy, only
   grave. For I certainly prefer a man to smile who has a stern
   countenance than the reverse; for so his laughter will be less apt to
   become the object of ridicule.

   Smiling even requires to be made the subject of discipline. If it is at
   what is disgraceful, we ought to blush rather than smile, lest we seem
   to take pleasure in it by sympathy; if at what is painful, it is
   fitting to look sad rather than to seem pleased. For to do the former
   is a sign of rational human thought; the other infers suspicion of
   cruelty.

   We are not to laugh perpetually, for that is going beyond bounds; nor
   in the presence of elderly persons, or others worthy of respect, unless
   they indulge in pleasantry for our amusement. Nor are we to laugh
   before all and sundry, nor in every place, nor to every one, nor about
   everything. For to children and women especially laughter is the cause
   of slipping into scandal. And even to appear stern serves to keep those
   about us at their distance. For gravity can ward off the approaches of
   licentiousness by a mere look. All senseless people, to speak in a
   word, wine


   "Commands both to laugh luxuriously and to dance,"

   changing effeminate manners to softness. We must consider, too, how
   consequently freedom of speech leads impropriety on to filthy speaking.


   "And he uttered a word which had been better unsaid." [1420]

   Especially, therefore, in liquor crafty men's characters are wont to be
   seen through, stripped as they are of their mask through the caitiff
   licence of intoxication, through which reason, weighed down in the soul
   itself by drunkenness, is lulled to sleep, and unruly passions are
   roused, which overmaster the feebleness of the mind.

      Chapter VI.--On Filthy Speaking.

   From filthy speaking we ourselves must entirely abstain, and stop the
   mouths of those who practice it by stern looks and averting the face,
   and by what we call making a mock of one: often also by a harsher mode
   of speech. "For what proceedeth out of the mouth," He says, "defileth a
   man," [1421] --shows him to be unclean, and heathenish, and untrained,
   and licentious, and not select, and proper, and honourable, and
   temperate. [1422]

   And as a similar rule holds with regard to hearing and seeing in the
   case of what is obscene, the divine Instructor, following the same
   course with both, arrays those children who are engaged in the struggle
   in words of modesty, as ear-guards, so that the pulsation of
   fornication may not penetrate to the bruising of the soul; and He
   directs the eyes to the sight of what is honourable, saying that it is
   better to make a slip with the feet than with the eyes. This filthy
   speaking the apostle beats off, saying, "Let no corrupt communication
   proceed out of your mouth, but what is good." [1423] And again, "As
   becometh saints, let not filthiness be named among you, nor foolish
   talking, nor jesting, which things are not seemly, but rather giving of
   thanks." [1424] And if "he that calls his brother a fool be in danger
   of the judgment," what shall we pronounce regarding him who speaks what
   is foolish? Is it not written respecting such: "Whosoever shall speak
   an idle word, shall give an account to the Lord in the day of
   judgment?" [1425] And again, "By thy speech thou shalt be justified,"
   He says, "and by thy speech thou shalt be condemned." [1426] What,
   then, are the salutary ear-guards, and what the regulations for
   slippery eyes? Conversations with the righteous, preoccupying and
   forearming the ears against those that would lead away from the truth.


   "Evil communications corrupt good manners,"

   says Poetry. More nobly the apostle says, "Be haters of the evil;
   cleave to the good." [1427] For he who associates with the saints shall
   be sanctified. From shameful things addressed to the ears, and words
   and sights, we must entirely abstain. [1428] And much more must we keep
   pure from shameful deeds: on the one hand, from exhibiting and exposing
   parts of the body which we ought not; and on the other, from beholding
   what is forbidden. For the modest son could not bear to look on the
   shameful exposure of the righteous man; and modesty covered what
   intoxication exposed--the spectacle of the transgression of ignorance.
   [1429] No less ought we to keep pure from calumnious reports, to which
   the ears of those who have believed in Christ ought to be inaccessible.

   It is on this account, as appears to me, that the Instructor does not
   permit us to give utterance to aught unseemly, fortifying us at an
   early stage against licentiousness. For He is admirable always at
   cutting out the roots of sins, such as, "Thou shalt not commit
   adultery," by "Thou shalt not lust." [1430] For adultery is the fruit
   of lust, which is the evil root. And so likewise also in this instance
   the Instructor censures licence in names, and thus cuts off the
   licentious intercourse of excess. For licence in names produces the
   desire of being indecorous in conduct; and the observance of modesty in
   names is a training in resistance to lasciviousness. We have shown in a
   more exhaustive treatise, that neither in the names nor in the members
   to which appellations not in common use are applied, is there the
   designation of what is really obscene.

   For neither are knee and leg, and such other members, nor are the names
   applied to them, and the activity put forth by them, obscene. And even
   the pudenda are to be regarded as objects suggestive of modesty, not
   shame. It is their unlawful activity that is shameful, and deserving
   ignominy, and reproach, and punishment. For the only thing that is in
   reality shameful is wickedness, and what is done through it. In
   accordance with these remarks, conversation about deeds of wickedness
   is appropriately termed filthy [shameful] speaking, as talk about
   adultery and pæderasty and the like. Frivolous prating, too, is to be
   put to silence. [1431] "For," it is said, "in much speaking thou shalt
   not escape sin." [1432] "Sins of the tongue, therefore, shall be
   punished." "There is he who is silent, and is found wise; and there is
   he that is hated for much speech." [1433] But still more, the prater
   makes himself the object of disgust. "For he that multiplieth speech
   abominates his own soul." [1434]

      Chapter VII.--Directions for Those Who Live Together.

   Let us keep away from us jibing, the originator of insult, from which
   strifes and contentions and enmities burst forth. Insult, we have said,
   is the servant of drunkenness. A man is judged, not from his deeds
   alone, but from his words. "In a banquet," it is said, "reprove not thy
   neighbour, nor say to him a word of reproach." [1435] For if we are
   enjoined especially to associate with saints, it is a sin to jibe at a
   saint: "For from the mouth of the foolish," says the Scripture, "is a
   staff of insult," [1436] --meaning by staff the prop of insult, on
   which insult leans and rests. Whence I admire the apostle, who, in
   reference to this, exhorts us not to utter "scurrilous nor unsuitable
   words." [1437] For if the assemblies at festivals take place on account
   of affection, and the end of a banquet is friendliness towards those
   who meet, and meat and drink accompany affection, how should not
   conversation be conducted in a rational manner, and puzzling people
   with questions be avoided from affection? For if we meet together for
   the purpose of increasing our good-will to each other, why should we
   stir up enmity by jibing? It is better to be silent than to contradict,
   and thereby add sin to ignorance. "Blessed," in truth, "is the man who
   has not made a slip with his mouth, and has not been pierced by the
   pain of sin;" [1438] or has repented of what he has said amiss, or has
   spoken so as to wound no one. On the whole, let young men and young
   women altogether keep away from such festivals, that they may not make
   a slip in respect to what is unsuitable. For things to which their ears
   are unaccustomed, and unseemly sights, inflame the mind, while faith
   within them is still wavering; and the instability of their age
   conspires to make them easily carried away by lust. Sometimes also they
   are the cause of others stumbling, by displaying the dangerous charms
   of their time of life. For Wisdom appears to enjoin well: "Sit not at
   all with a married woman, and recline not on the elbow with her;"
   [1439] that is, do not sup nor eat with her frequently. Wherefore he
   adds, "And do not join company with her in wine, lest thy heart incline
   to her, and by thy blood slide to ruin." [1440] For the licence of
   intoxication is dangerous, and prone to deflower. And he names "a
   married woman," because the danger is greater to him who attempts to
   break the connubial bond.

   But if any necessity arises, commanding the presence of married women,
   let them be well clothed--without by raiment, within by modesty. But as
   for such as are unmarried, it is the extremest scandal for them to be
   present at a banquet of men, especially men under the influence of
   wine. And let the men, fixing their eyes on the couch, and leaning
   without moving on their elbows, be present with their ears alone; and
   if they sit, let them not have their feet crossed, nor place one thigh
   on another, nor apply the hand to the chin. For it is vulgar not to
   bear one's self without support, and consequently a fault in a young
   man. And perpetually moving and changing one's position is a sign of
   frivolousness. It is the part of a temperate man also, in eating and
   drinking, to take a small portion, and deliberately, not eagerly, both
   at the beginning and during the courses, and to leave off betimes, and
   so show his indifference. "Eat," it is said, "like a man what is set
   before you. Be the first to stop for the sake of regimen; and, if
   seated in the midst of several people, do not stretch out your hand
   before them." [1441] You must never rush forward under the influence of
   gluttony; nor must you, though desirous, reach out your hand till some
   time, inasmuch as by greed one shows an uncontrolled appetite. Nor are
   you, in the midst of the repast, to exhibit yourselves hugging your
   food like wild beasts; nor helping yourselves to too much sauce, for
   man is not by nature a sauce-consumer, but a bread-eater. A temperate
   man, too, must rise before the general company, and retire quietly from
   the banquet. "For at the time for rising," it is said, "be not the
   last; haste home." [1442] The twelve, having called together the
   multitude of the disciples, said, "It is not meet for us to leave the
   word of God and serve tables." [1443] If they avoided this, much more
   did they shun gluttony. And the apostles themselves, writing to the
   brethren at Antioch, and in Syria and Cilicia, said: "It seemed good to
   the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no other burden than these
   necessary things, to abstain from things offered to idols, and from
   blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication, from which, if
   you keep yourselves, ye shall do well." [1444] But we must guard
   against drunkenness as against hemlock; for both drag down to death. We
   must also check excessive laughter and immoderate tears. For often
   people under the influence of wine, after laughing immoderately, then
   are, I know not how, by some impulse of intoxication moved to tears;
   for both effiminacy and violence are discordant with the word. And
   elderly people, looking on the young as children, may, though but very
   rarely, be playful with them, joking with them to train them in good
   behaviour. For example, before a bashful and silent youth, one might by
   way of pleasantry speak thus: "This son of mine (I mean one who is
   silent) is perpetually talking." For a joke such as this enhances the
   youth's modesty, by showing the good qualities that belong to him
   playfully, by censure of the bad quantities, which do not. For this
   device is instructive, confirming as it does what is present by what is
   not present. Such, certainly, is the intention of him who says that a
   water-drinker and a sober man gets intoxicated and drunk. But if there
   are those who like to jest at people, we must be silent, and dispense
   with superfluous words like full cups. For such sport is dangerous.
   "The mouth of the impetuous approaches to contrition." [1445] "Thou
   shalt not receive a foolish report, nor shalt thou agree with an unjust
   person to be an unjust witness," [1446] neither in calumnies nor in
   injurious speeches, much less evil practices. I also should think it
   right to impose a limit on the speech of rightly regulated persons, who
   are impelled to speak to one who maintains a conversation with them.
   "For silence is the excellence of women, and the safe prize of the
   young; but good speech is characteristic of experienced, mature age.
   Speak, old man, at a banquet, for it is becoming to you. But speak
   without embarrassment, and with accuracy of knowledge. Youth, Wisdom
   also commands thee. Speak, if you must, with hesitation, on being twice
   asked; sum up your discourse in a few words." [1447] But let both
   speakers regulate their discourse according to just proportion. For
   loudness of utterance is most insane; while an inaudible utterance is
   characteristic of a senseless man, for people will not hear: the one is
   the mark of pusillanimity, the other of arrogance. Let contentiousness
   in words, for the sake of a useless triumph, be banished; for our aim
   is to be free from perturbation. Such is the meaning of the phrase,
   [1448] "Peace to thee." Answer not a word before you hear. An enervated
   voice is the sign of effeminacy. But modulation in the voice is
   characteristic of a wise man, who keeps his utterance from loudness,
   from drawling, from rapidity, from prolixity. For we ought not to speak
   long or much, nor ought we to speak frivolously. Nor must we converse
   rapidly and rashly. For the voice itself, so to speak, ought to receive
   its just dues; and those who are vociferous and clamorous ought to be
   silenced. For this reason, the wise Ulysses chastised Thersites with
   stripes:--


   "Only Thersites, with unmeasured words,

   Of which he had good store, to rate the chiefs,

   Not over-seemly, but wherewith he thought

   To move the crowd to laughter, brawled aloud." [1449]

   "For dreadful in his destruction is a loquacious man." [1450] And it is
   with triflers as with old shoes: all the rest is worn away by evil; the
   tongue only is left for destruction. Wherefore Wisdom gives these most
   useful exhortations: "Do not talk trifles in the multitude of the
   elders." Further, eradicating frivolousness, beginning with God, it
   lays down the law for our regulation somewhat thus: "Do not repeat your
   words in your prayer." [1451] Chirruping and whistling, and sounds made
   through the fingers, by which domestics are called, being irrational
   signs, are to be given up by rational men. Frequent spitting, too, and
   violent clearing of the throat, and wiping one's nose at an
   entertainment, are to be shunned. For respect is assuredly to be had to
   the guests, lest they turn in disgust from such filthiness, which
   argues want of restraint. For we are not to copy oxen and asses, whose
   manger and dunghill are together. For many wipe their noses and spit
   even whilst supping.

   If any one is attacked with sneezing, just as in the case of hiccup, he
   must not startle those near him with the explosion, and so give proof
   of his bad breeding; but the hiccup is to be quietly transmitted with
   the expiration of the breath, the mouth being composed becomingly, and
   not gaping and yawning like the tragic masks. So the disturbance of
   hiccup may be avoided by making the respirations gently; for thus the
   threatening symptoms of the ball of wind will be dissipated in the most
   seemly way, by managing its egress so as also to conceal anything which
   the air forcibly expelled may bring up with it. To wish to add to the
   noises, instead of diminishing them, is the sign of arrogance and
   disorderliness. Those, too, who scrape their teeth, bleeding the
   wounds, are disagreeable to themselves and detestable to their
   neighbours. Scratching the ears and the irritation of sneezing are
   swinish itchings, and attend unbridled fornication. Both shameful
   sights and shameful conversation about them are to be shunned. Let the
   look be steady, and the turning and movement of the neck, and the
   motions of the hands in conversation, be decorous. In a word, the
   Christian is characterized by composure, tranquillity, calmness, and
   peace. [1452]

      Chapter VIII.--On the Use of Ointments and Crowns.

   The use of crowns and ointments is not necessary for us; for it impels
   to pleasures and indulgences, especially on the approach of night. I
   know that the woman brought to the sacred supper "an alabaster box of
   ointment," [1453] and anointed the feet of the Lord, and refreshed Him;
   and I know that the ancient kings of the Hebrews were crowned with gold
   and precious stones. But the woman not having yet received the Word
   (for she was still a sinner), honoured the Lord with what she thought
   the most precious thing in her possession--the ointment; and with the
   ornament of her person, with her hair, she wiped off the superfluous
   ointment, while she expended on the Lord tears of repentance:
   "wherefore her sins are forgiven." [1454]

   This may be a symbol of the Lord's teaching, and of His suffering. For
   the feet anointed with fragrant ointment mean divine instruction
   travelling with renown to the ends of the earth. "For their sound hath
   gone forth to the ends of the earth." [1455] And if I seem not to
   insist too much, the feet of the Lord which were anointed are the
   apostles, having, according to prophecy, received the fragrant unction
   of the Holy Ghost. Those, therefore, who travelled over the world and
   preached the Gospel, are figuratively called the feet of the Lord, of
   whom also the Holy Spirit foretells in the psalm, "Let us adore at the
   place where His feet stood," [1456] that is, where the apostles, His
   feet, arrived; since, preached by them, He came to the ends of the
   earth. And tears are repentance; and the loosened hair proclaimed
   deliverance from the love of finery, and the affliction in patience
   which, on account of the Lord, attends preaching, the old vainglory
   being done away with by reason of the new faith. [1457]

   Besides, it shows the Lord's passion, if you understand it mystically
   thus: the oil (elaion) is the Lord Himself, from whom comes the mercy
   (eleos) which reaches us. But the ointment, which is adulterated oil,
   is the traitor Judas, by whom the Lord was anointed on the feet, being
   released from His sojourn in the world. For the dead are anointed. And
   the tears are we repentant sinners, who have believed in Him, and to
   whom He has forgiven our sins. And the dishevelled hair is mourning
   Jerusalem, the deserted, for whom the prophetic lamentations were
   uttered. The Lord Himself shall teach us that Judas the deceitful is
   meant: "He that dippeth with Me in the dish, the same shall betray Me."
   [1458] You see the treacherous guest, and this same Judas betrayed the
   Master with a kiss. For he was a hypocrite, giving a treacherous kiss,
   in imitation of another hypocrite of old. And He reproves that people
   respecting whom it was said, "This people honour Me with their lips;
   but their heart is far from Me." [1459] It is not improbable,
   therefore, that by the oil He means that disciple to whom was shown
   mercy, and by the tainted and poisoned oil the traitor.

   This was, then, what the anointed feet prophesied--the treason of
   Judas, when the Lord went to His passion. And the Saviour Himself
   washing the feet of the disciples, [1460] and despatching them to do
   good deeds, pointed out their pilgrimage for the benefit of the
   nations, making them beforehand fair and pure by His power. Then the
   ointment breathed on them its fragrance, and the work of sweet savour
   reaching to all was proclaimed; for the passion of the Lord has filled
   us with sweet fragrance, and the Hebrews with guilt. This the apostle
   most clearly showed, when he said, "thanks be to God, who always makes
   us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of His
   knowledge by us in every place. For we are to God a sweet savour of the
   Lord, in them that are saved, and them that are lost; to one a savour
   of death unto death, to the other a savour of life unto life." [1461]
   And the kings of the Jews using gold and precious stones and a
   variegated crown, the anointed ones wearing Christ symbolically on the
   head, were unconsciously adorned with the head of the Lord. The
   precious stone, or pearl, or emerald, points out the Word Himself. The
   gold, again, is the incorruptible Word, who admits not the poison of
   corruption. The Magi, accordingly, brought to Him on His birth, gold,
   the symbol of royalty. And this crown, after the image of the Lord,
   fades not as a flower.

   I know, too, the words of Aristippus the Cyrenian. Aristippus was a
   luxurious man. He asked an answer to a sophistical proposition in the
   following terms: "A horse anointed with ointment is not injured in his
   excellence as a horse, nor is a dog which has been anointed, in his
   excellence as a dog; no more is a man," he added, and so finished. But
   the dog and horse take no account of the ointment, whilst in the case
   of those whose perceptions are more rational, applying girlish scents
   to their persons, its use is more censurable. Of these ointments there
   are endless varieties, such as the Brenthian, the Metallian, and the
   royal; the Plangonian and the Psagdian of Egypt. Simonides is not
   ashamed in Iambic lines to say,--


   "I was anointed with ointments and perfumes,

   And with nard."

   For a merchant was present. They use, too, the unguent made from
   lilies, and that from the cypress. Nard is in high estimation with
   them, and the ointment prepared from roses and the others which women
   use besides, both moist and dry, scents for rubbing and for fumigating;
   for day by day their thoughts are directed to the gratification of
   insatiable desire, to the exhaustless variety of fragrance. Wherefore
   also they are redolent of an excessive luxuriousness. And they fumigate
   and sprinkle their clothes, their bed-clothes, and their houses. Luxury
   all but compels vessels for the meanest uses to smell of perfume.

   There are some who, annoyed at the attention bestowed on this, appear
   to me to be rightly so averse to perfumes on account of their rendering
   manhood effeminate, as to banish their compounders and vendors from
   well-regulated states, and banish, too, the dyers of flower-coloured
   wools. For it is not right that ensnaring garments and unguents should
   be admitted into the city of truth; but it is highly requisite for the
   men who belong to us to give forth the odour not of ointments, but of
   nobleness and goodness. And let woman breathe the odour of the true
   royal ointment, that of Christ, not of unguents and scented powders;
   and let her always be anointed with the ambrosial chrism of modesty,
   and find delight in the holy unguent, the Spirit. This ointment of
   pleasant fragrance Christ prepares for His disciples, compounding the
   ointment of celestial aromatic ingredients.

   Wherefore also the Lord Himself is anointed with an ointment, as is
   mentioned by David: "Wherefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with
   the oil of gladness above thy fellows; myrrh, and stacte, and cassia
   from thy garments." [1462] But let us not unconsciously abominate
   unguents, like vultures or like beetles (for these, they say, when
   smeared with ointment, die); and let a few unguents be selected by
   women, such as will not be overpowering to a husband. For excessive
   anointings with unguents savour of a funeral and not of connubial life.
   Yet oil itself is inimical to bees and insects; and some men it
   benefits, and some it summons to the fight; and those who were formerly
   friends, when anointed with it, it turns out to deadly combat.

   Ointment being smooth oil, do you not think that it is calculated to
   render noble manners effeminate? Certainly. And as we have abandoned
   luxury in taste, so certainly do we renounce voluptuousness in sights
   and odours; lest through the senses, as through unwatched doors, we
   unconsciously give access into the soul to that excess which we have
   driven away. If, then, we say that the Lord the great High Priest
   offers to God the incense of sweet fragrance, let us not imagine that
   this is a sacrifice and sweet fragrance of incense; [1463] but let us
   understand it to mean, that the Lord lays the acceptable offering of
   love, the spiritual fragrance, on the altar.

   To resume: oil itself suffices to lubricate the skin, and relax the
   nerves, and remove any heavy smell from the body, if we require oil for
   this purpose. But attention to sweet scents is a bait which draws us in
   to sensual lust. For the licentious man is led on every hand, both by
   his food, his bed, his conversation, by his eyes, his ears, his jaws,
   and by his nostrils too. As oxen are pulled by rings and ropes, so is
   the voluptuary by fumigations and unguents, and the sweet scents of
   crowns. But since we assign no place to pleasure which is linked to no
   use serviceable to life, come let us also distinguish here too,
   selecting what is useful. For there are sweet scents which neither make
   the head heavy nor provoke love, and are not redolent of embraces and
   licentious companionship, but, along with moderation, are salutary,
   nourishing the brain when labouring under indisposition, and
   strengthening the stomach. One must not therefore refrigerate himself
   with flowers when he wishes to supple his nerves. For their use is not
   wholly to be laid aside, but ointment is to be employed as a medicine
   and help in order to bring up the strength when enfeebled, and against
   catarrhs, and colds, and ennui, as the comic poet says:--


   "The nostrils are anointed; it being

   A most essential thing for health to fill the brain with good odours."

   The rubbing of the feet also with the fatness of warming or cooling
   unguents is practiced on account of its beneficial effects; so
   consequently, in the case of those who are thus saturated, an
   attraction and flow take place from the head to the inferior members.
   But pleasure to which no utility attaches, induces the suspicion of
   meretricious habits, and is a drug provocative of the passions. Rubbing
   one's self with ointment is entirely different from anointing one's
   self with ointment. The former is effeminate, while anointing with
   ointment is in some cases beneficial. Aristippus the philosopher,
   accordingly, when anointed with ointment, said "that the wretched
   Cinoedi deserved to perish miserably for bringing the utility of
   ointment into bad repute." "Honour the physician for his usefulness,"
   says the Scripture, "for the Most High made him; and the art of healing
   is of the Lord." Then he adds, "And the compounder of unguents will
   make the mixture," [1464] since unguents have been given manifestly for
   use, not for voluptuousness. For we are by no means to care for the
   exciting properties of unguents, but to choose what is useful in them,
   since God hath permitted the production of oil for the mitigation of
   men's pains.

   And silly women, who dye their grey hair and anoint their locks, grow
   speedily greyer by the perfumes they use, which are of a drying nature.
   Wherefore also those that anoint themselves become drier, and the
   dryness makes them greyer. For if greyness is an exsiccation of the
   hair, or defect of heat, the dryness drinking up the moisture which is
   the natural nutriment of the hair, and making it grey, how can we any
   longer retain a liking for unguents, through which ladies, in trying to
   escape grey hair, become grey? And as dogs with fine sense of smell
   track the wild beasts by the scent, so also the temperate scent the
   licentious by the superfluous perfume of unguents.

   Such a use of crowns, also, has degenerated to scenes of revelry and
   intoxication. Do not encircle my head with a crown, for in the
   springtime it is delightful to while away the time on the dewy meads,
   while soft and many-coloured flowers are in bloom, and, like the bees,
   enjoy a natural and pure fragrance. [1465] But to adorn one's self with
   "a crown woven from the fresh mead," and wear it at home, were unfit
   for a man of temperance. For it is not suitable to fill the wanton hair
   with rose-leaves, or violets, or lilies, or other such flowers,
   stripping the sward of its flowers. For a crown encircling the head
   cools the hair, both on account of its moisture and its coolness.
   Accordingly, physicians, determining by physiology that the brain is
   cold, approve of anointing the breast and the points of the nostrils,
   so that the warm exhalation passing gently through, may salutarily warm
   the chill. A man ought not therefore to cool himself with flowers.
   Besides, those who crown themselves destroy the pleasure there is in
   flowers: for they enjoy neither the sight of them, since they wear the
   crown above their eyes; nor their fragrance, since they put the flowers
   away above the organs of respiration. For the fragrance ascending and
   exhaling naturally, the organ of respiration is left destitute of
   enjoyment, the fragrance being carried away. As beauty, so also the
   flower delights when looked at; and it is meet to glorify the Creator
   by the enjoyment of the sight of beautiful objects. [1466] The use of
   them is injurious, and passes swiftly away, avenged by remorse. Very
   soon their evanescence is proved; for both fade, both the flower and
   beauty. Further, whoever touches them is cooled by the former, inflamed
   by the latter. In one word, the enjoyment of them except by sight is a
   crime, and not luxury. It becomes us who truly follow the Scripture to
   enjoy ourselves temperately, as in Paradise. We must regard the woman's
   crown to be her husband, and the husband's crown to be marriage; and
   the flowers of marriage the children of both, which the divine
   husbandman plucks from meadows of flesh. "Children's children are the
   crown of old men." [1467] And the glory of children is their fathers,
   it is said; and our glory is the Father of all; and the crown of the
   whole church is Christ. As roots and plants, so also have flowers their
   individual properties, some beneficial, some injurious, some also
   dangerous. The ivy is cooling; nux emits a stupefying effluvium, as the
   etymology shows. The narcissus is a flower with a heavy odour; the name
   evinces this, and it induces a torpor (narken) in the nerves. And the
   effluvia of roses and violets being mildly cool, relieve and prevent
   headaches. But we who are not only not permitted to drink with others
   to intoxication, but not even to indulge in much wine, [1468] do not
   need the crocus or the flower of the cypress to lead us to an easy
   sleep. Many of them also, by their odours, warm the brain, which is
   naturally cold, volatilizing the effusions of the head. The rose is
   hence said to have received its name (rhodon) because it emits a
   copious stream (rheuma) of odour (odode). Wherefore also it quickly
   fades.

   But the use of crowns did not exist at all among the ancient Greeks;
   for neither the suitors nor the luxurious Phæacians used them. But at
   the games there was at first the gift to the athletes; second, the
   rising up to applaud; third, the strewing with leaves; lastly, the
   crown, Greece after the Median war having given herself up to luxury.

   Those, then, who are trained by the Word are restrained from the use of
   crowns; and do not think that this Word, which has its seat in the
   brain, ought to be bound about, not because the crown is the symbol of
   the recklessness of revelry, but because it has been dedicated to
   idols. Sophocles accordingly called the narcissus "the ancient coronet
   of the great gods," speaking of the earth-born divinities; and Sappho
   crowns the Muses with the rose:--


   "For thou dost not share in roses from Pieria."

   They say, too, that Here delights in the lily, and Artemis in the
   myrtle. For if the flowers were made especially for man, and senseless
   people have taken them not for their own proper and grateful use, but
   have abused them to the thankless service of demons, we must keep from
   them for conscience sake. The crown is the symbol of untroubled
   tranquillity. For this reason they crown the dead, and idols, too, on
   the same account, by this fact giving testimony to their being dead.
   For revellers do not without crowns celebrate their orgies; and when
   once they are encircled with flowers, at last they are inflamed
   excessively. We must have no communion with demons. Nor must we crown
   the living image of God after the manner of dead idols. For the fair
   crown of amaranth is laid up for those who have lived well. This flower
   the earth is not able to bear; heaven alone is competent to produce it.
   [1469] Further, it were irrational in us, who have heard that the Lord
   was crowned with thorns, [1470] to crown ourselves with flowers,
   insulting thus the sacred passion of the Lord. For the Lord's crown
   prophetically pointed to us, who once were barren, but are placed
   around Him through the Church of which He is the Head. But it is also a
   type of faith, of life in respect of the substance of the wood, of joy
   in respect of the appellation of crown, of danger in respect of the
   thorn, for there is no approaching to the Word without blood. But this
   platted crown fades, and the plait of perversity is untied, and the
   flower withers. For the glory of those who have not believed on the
   Lord fades. And they crowned Jesus raised aloft, testifying to their
   own ignorance. For being hard of heart, they understood not that this
   very thing, which they called the disgrace of the Lord, was a prophecy
   wisely uttered: "The Lord was not known by the people" [1471] which
   erred, which was not circumcised in understanding, whose darkness was
   not enlightened, which knew not God, denied the Lord, forfeited the
   place of the true Israel, persecuted God, hoped to reduce the Word to
   disgrace; and Him whom they crucified as a malefactor they crowned as a
   king. Wherefore the Man on whom they believed not, they shall know to
   be the loving God the Lord, the Just. Whom they provoked to show
   Himself to be the Lord, to Him when lifted up they bore witness, by
   encircling Him, who is exalted above every name, with the diadem of
   righteousness by the ever-blooming thorn. This diadem, being hostile to
   those who plot against Him, coerces them; and friendly to those who
   form the Church, defends them. This crown is the flower of those who
   have believed on the glorified One, but covers with blood and chastises
   those who have not believed. It is a symbol, too, of the Lord's
   successful work, He having borne on His head, the princely part of His
   body, all our iniquities by which we were pierced. For He by His own
   passion rescued us from offences, and sins, and such like thorns; and
   having destroyed the devil, deservedly said in triumph, "O Death, where
   is thy sting?" [1472] And we eat grapes from thorns, and figs from
   thistles; while those to whom He stretched forth His hands--the
   disobedient and unfruitful people--He lacerates into wounds. I can also
   show you another mystic meaning in it. [1473] For when the Almighty
   Lord of the universe began to legislate by the Word, and wished His
   power to be manifested to Moses, a godlike vision of light that had
   assumed a shape was shown him in the burning bush (the bush is a thorny
   plant); but when the Word ended the giving of the law and His stay with
   men, the Lord was again mystically crowned with thorn. On His departure
   from this world to the place whence He came, He repeated the beginning
   of His old descent, in order that the Word beheld at first in the bush,
   and afterwards taken up crowned by the thorn, might show the whole to
   be the work of one power, He Himself being one, the Son of the Father,
   who is truly one, the beginning and the end of time.

   But I have made a digression from the pædagogic style of speech, and
   introduced the didactic. [1474] I return accordingly to my subject.

   To resume, then: we have showed that in the department of medicine, for
   healing, and sometimes also for moderate recreation, the delight
   derived from flowers, and the benefit derived from unguents and
   perfumes, are not to be overlooked. And if some say, What pleasure,
   then, is there in flowers to those that do not use them? let them know,
   then, that unguents are prepared from them, and are most useful. The
   Susinian ointment is made from various kinds of lilies; and it is
   warming, aperient, drawing, moistening, abstergent, subtle,
   antibilious, emollient. The Narcissinian is made from the narcissus,
   and is equally beneficial with the Susinian. The Myrsinian, made of
   myrtle and myrtle berries, is a styptic, stopping effusions from the
   body; and that from roses is refrigerating. For, in a word, these also
   were created for our use. "Hear me," it is said, "and grow as a rose
   planted by the streams of waters, and give forth a sweet fragrance like
   frankincense, and bless the Lord for His works." [1475] We should have
   much to say respecting them, were we to speak of flowers and odours as
   made for necessary purposes, and not for the excesses of luxury. And if
   a concession must be made, it is enough for people to enjoy the
   fragrance of flowers; but let them not crown themselves with them. For
   the Father takes great care of man, and gives to him alone His own art.
   The Scripture therefore says, "Water, and fire, and iron, and milk, and
   fine flour of wheat, and honey, the blood of the grape, and oil, and
   clothing,--all these things are for the good of the godly." [1476]

      Chap. IX.--On Sleep.

   How, in due course, we are to go to sleep, in remembrance of the
   precepts of temperance, we must now say. For after the repast, having
   given thanks to God for our participation in our enjoyments, and for
   the [happy] passing of the day, [1477] our talk must be turned to
   sleep. Magnificence of bed-clothes, gold-embroidered carpets, and
   smooth carpets worked with gold, and long fine robes of purple, and
   costly fleecy cloaks, and manufactured rugs of purple, and mantles of
   thick pile, and couches softer than sleep, are to be banished.

   For, besides the reproach of voluptuousness, sleeping on downy feathers
   is injurious, when our bodies fall down as into a yawning hollow, on
   account of the softness of the bedding.

   For they are not convenient for sleepers turning in them, on account of
   the bed rising into a hill on either side of the body. Nor are they
   suitable for the digestion of the food, but rather for burning it up,
   and so destroying the nutriment. But stretching one's self on even
   couches, affording a kind of natural gymnasium for sleep, contributes
   to the digestion of the food. And those that can roll on other beds,
   having this, as it were, for a natural gymnasium for sleep, digest food
   more easily, and render themselves fitter for emergencies. Moreover,
   silver-footed couches argue great ostentation; and the ivory on beds,
   the body having left the soul, [1478] is not permissible for holy men,
   being a lazy contrivance for rest.

   We must not occupy our thoughts about these things, for the use of them
   is not forbidden to those who possess them; but solicitude about them
   is prohibited, for happiness is not to be found in them. On the other
   hand, it savours of cynic vanity for a man to act as Diomede,--


   "And he stretched himself under a wild bull's hide," [1479] --

   unless circumstances compel.

   Ulysses rectified the unevenness of the nuptial couch with a stone.
   Such frugality and self-help was practiced not by private individuals
   alone, but by the chiefs of the ancient Greeks. But why speak of these?
   Jacob slept on the ground, and a stone served him for a pillow; and
   then was he counted worthy to behold the vision--that was above man.
   And in conformity with reason, the bed which we use must be simple and
   frugal, and so constructed that, by avoiding the extremes [of too much
   indulgence and too much endurance], it may be comfortable: if it is
   warm, to protect us; if cold, to warm us. But let not the couch be
   elaborate, and let it have smooth feet; for elaborate turnings form
   occasionally paths for creeping things which twine themselves about the
   incisions of the work, and do not slip off.

   Especially is a moderate softness in the bed suitable for manhood; for
   sleep ought not to be for the total enervation of the body, but for its
   relaxation. Wherefore I say that it ought not to be allowed to come on
   us for the sake of indulgence, but in order to rest from action. We
   must therefore sleep so as to be easily awaked. For it is said, "Let
   your loins be girt about, and your lamps burning; and ye yourselves
   like to men that watch for their lord, that when he returns from the
   marriage, and comes and knocks, they may straightway open to him.
   Blessed are those servants whom the Lord, when He cometh, shall find
   watching." [1480] For there is no use of a sleeping man, as there is
   not of a dead man. Wherefore we ought often to rise by night and bless
   God. [1481] For blessed are they who watch for Him, and so make
   themselves like the angels, whom we call "watchers." But a man asleep
   is worth nothing, any more than if he were not alive.

   But he who has the light watches, "and darkness seizes not on him,"
   [1482] nor sleep, since darkness does not. He that is illuminated is
   therefore awake towards God; and such an one lives. "For what was made
   in Him was life." [1483] "Blessed is the man," says Wisdom, "who shall
   hear me, and the man who shall keep my ways, watching at my doors,
   daily observing the posts of my entrances." [1484] "Let us not then
   sleep, as do others, but let us watch," says the Scripture, "and be
   sober. For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be
   drunken, are drunken in the night," that is, in the darkness of
   ignorance. "But let us who are of the day be sober. For ye are all
   children of the light, and children of the day; we are not of the
   night, nor of the darkness." [1485] But whoever of us is most
   solicitous for living the true life, and for entertaining noble
   sentiments, will keep awake for as long time as possible, reserving to
   himself only what in this respect is conducive to his own health; and
   that is not very usual.

   But devotion to activity begets an everlasting vigil after toils. Let
   not food weigh us down, but lighten us; that we may be injured as
   little as possible by sleep, as those that swim with weights hanging to
   them are weighed down. But, on the other hand, let temperance raise us
   as from the abyss beneath to the enterprises of wakefulness. For the
   oppression of sleep is like death, which forces us into insensibility,
   cutting off the light by the closing of the eyelids. Let not us, then,
   who are sons of the true light, close the door against this light; but
   turning in on ourselves, illumining the eyes of the hidden man, and
   gazing on the truth itself, and receiving its streams, let us clearly
   and intelligibly reveal such dreams as are true.

   But the hiccuping of those who are loaded with wine, and the snortings
   of those who are stuffed with food, and the snoring rolled in the
   bed-clothes, and the rumblings of pained stomachs, cover over the
   clear-seeing eye of the soul, by filling the mind with ten thousand
   phantasies. And the cause is too much food, which drags the rational
   part of man down to a condition of stupidity. For much sleep brings
   advantage neither to our bodies nor our souls; nor is it suitable at
   all to those processes which have truth for their object, although
   agreeable to nature.

   Now, just Lot (for I pass over at present the account of the economy of
   regeneration [1486] ) would not have been drawn into that unhallowed
   intercourse, had he not been intoxicated by his daughters, and
   overpowered by sleep. If, therefore, we cut off the causes of great
   tendency to sleep, we shall sleep the more soberly. For those who have
   the sleepless Word dwelling in them, ought not to sleep the livelong
   night; but they ought to rise by night, especially when the days are
   coming to an end, and one devote himself to literature, another begin
   his art, the women handle the distaff, and all of us should, so to
   speak, fight against sleep, accustoming ourselves to this gently and
   gradually, so that through wakefulness we may partake of life for a
   longer period.

   We, then, who assign the best part of the night to wakefulness, must by
   no manner of means sleep by day; and fits of uselessness, and napping
   and stretching one's self, and yawning, are manifestations of frivolous
   uneasiness of soul. And in addition to all, we must know this, that the
   need of sleep is not in the soul. For it is ceaselessly active. But the
   body is relieved by being resigned to rest, the soul whilst not acting
   through the body, but exercising intelligence within itself. [1487]
   Thus also, such dreams as are true, in the view of him who reflects
   rightly, are the thoughts of a sober soul, undistracted for the time by
   the affections of the body, and counselling with itself in the best
   manner. For the soul to cease from activity within itself, were
   destruction to it. Wherefore always contemplating God, and by perpetual
   converse with Him inoculating the body with wakefulness, it raises man
   to equality with angelic grace, and from the practice of wakefulness it
   grasps the eternity of life. [1488]

      Chapter X. [1489] --Quænam de Procreatione Liberorum Tractanda Sint.
      [1490]

   Tempus autem opportunum conjunctionis solis iis relinquitur
   considerandum, qui juncti sunt matrimonio; qui autem matrimonio juncti
   sunt, iis scopus est et institutum, liberorum susceptio: finis autem,
   ut boni sint liberi: quemadmodum agricolæ seminis quidem dejectionis
   causa est, quod nutrimenti habendi curam gerat; agriculturæ autem finis
   est, fructuum perceptio. Multo autem melior est agricola, qui terram
   colit animatam: ille enim ed tempus alimentum expetens, hic vero ut
   universum permanent, curam gerens, agricolæofficio fungitur: et ille
   quidem propter se, hic vero propter Deum plantat ac seminat. Dixit
   enim: "Multiplicemini;" [1491] ubi hoc subaudiendum est: "Et ea ratione
   fit homo Dei imago, quatenus homo co-operatur ad generationem hominis."
   Non est quælibet terra apta ad suscipienda semina: quod si etiam sit
   quælibet, non tamen eidem agricolæ. Neque vero seminandum est supra
   petram, neque semen est contumlia afficiendum, quod quidem dux est et
   princeps generationis, estque substantia, quæ simul habet insitas
   naturæ rationes. Quæ sunt autem secundum naturam rationes, absque
   ratione præternaturalibus mandando meatibus, ignominia afficere, valde
   est impium. Videte itaque quomodo sapientissimus Moyses infrugiferam
   aliquando sationem symbolice repulerit: "Non comedes, inquiens,
   leporem, nec hyænam." [1492] Non vult homines esse qualitatis eorum
   participes, neque eis æqualem gustare libidinem: hæc enim animalia ad
   explendum coitum venereum feruntur insano quodam furore. Ac leporem
   quidem dicunt quotannis multiplicare anum, pro numero annorum, quos
   vixit, habentem foramina: et ea ratione dum leporis esum prohibet,
   significat se dehortari puerorum amorem. Hyænam autem vicissim singulis
   annis masculinum sexum mutare in femininum: significare autem non esse
   illi ad adulteria prorumpendum, qui ab hyæna abstinet. [1493]

   Well, I also agree that the consummately wise Moses confessedly
   indicates by the prohibition before us, that we must not resemble these
   animals; but I do not assent to the explanation of what has been
   symbolically spoken. For nature never can be forced to change. What
   once has been impressed on it, may not be transformed into the opposite
   by passion. For passion is not nature, and passion is wont to deface
   the form, not to cast it into a new shape. Though many birds are said
   to change with the seasons, both in colour and voice, as the blackbird
   (kossuphos), which becomes yellow from black, and a chatterer from a
   singing-bird. Similarly also the nightingale changes by turns both its
   colour and note. But they do not alter their nature itself, so as in
   the transformation to become female from male. But the new crop of
   feathers, like new clothes, produces a kind of colouring of the
   feathers, and a little after it evaporates in the rigour of winter, as
   a flower when its colour fades. And in like manner the voice itself,
   injured by the cold, is enfeebled. For, in consequence of the outer
   skin being thickened by the surrounding air, the arteries about the
   neck being compressed and filled, press hard on the breath; which being
   very much confined, emits a stifled sound. When, again, the breath is
   assimilated to the surrounding air and relaxed in spring, it is freed
   from its confined condition, and is carried through the dilated, though
   till then obstructed arteries, it warbles no longer a dying melody, but
   now gives forth a shrill note; and the yoice flows wide, and spring now
   becomes the song of the voice of birds.

   Nequaquam ergo credendum est, hyænam unquam mutare naturam: idem enim
   animal non habet simul ambo pudenda maris et feminæ, sicut nonnulli
   existimarunt, qui prodigiose hermaphroditos finxerunt, et inter marem
   et feminam, hanc masculo-feminam naturam innovarunt. Valde autem
   falluntur, ut qui non animadverterint, quam sit filiorum amans omnium
   mater et genetrix Natura: quoniam enim hoc animal, hyæna inquam, est
   salacissimum, sub cauda ante excrementi meatum, adnatum est ei quoddam
   carneum tuberculum, feminino pudendo figura persimile. Nullum autem
   meatum habet hæc figura carnis, qui in utilem aliquam desinat partem,
   vel in matricem inquam, vel in rectum intestinum: tantum habet magnam
   concavitatem, quæ inanem excipiat libidinem, quando aversi fuerint
   meatus, qui in concipiendo fetu occupati sunt. Hoc ipsum autem et
   masculo et feminæ hyænæ adnatum est, quod sit insigniter pathica:
   masculus enim vicissim et agit, et patitur: unde etiam rarissime
   inveniri potest hyæna femina: non enim frequenter concipit hoc animal,
   cum in eis largiter redundet ea, quæ præter naturam est, satio. Hac
   etiam ratione mihi videtur Plato in Phoedro, amorem puerorum repellens,
   eum appellate bestiam, quod frenum mordentes, qui se voluptatibus
   dedunt, libidinosi, quadrupedum coeunt more, et filios seminare
   conantur. Impios "autem tradidit Deus," ut air Apostolus, [1494] "in
   perturbationes ignominiæ: nam et feminæeorum mutaverunt naturalem usum
   in eum, qui est procter naturam: similiter autem et masculi eorum,
   relicto usu naturali, exarserunt in desiderio sui inter se invicem,
   masculi in masculos turpitudinem operantes, et mercedem, quam oportuit,
   erroris sui in se recipientes." At vero ne libidinosissimis quidem
   animantibus concessit natura in excrementi meatum semen immittere:
   urina enim in vesicam excernitur, humefactum alimentum in ventrum,
   lacryma vero in oculum, sanguis in venas, sordes in aures, mucus in
   hares defertur: fini autem recti intestini, sedes cohæret, per quam
   excrementa exponuntur. Sola ergo varia in hyænis natura, superfluo
   coitui superfluam hanc partem excogitavit, et ideo est etiam
   aliquantisper concavum, ut prurientibus partibus inserviat, exinde
   autem excæcatur concavitas: non fuit emm res fabricata ad generationem.
   Hinc nobis manifestum atque adeo in confesso est, vitandos esse cum
   masculis concubitus, et infrugiferas sationes, et Venerem præposteram,
   et quæ natura coalescere non possunt, androgynorum conjunctiones, ipsam
   naturam sequentibus, quæ id per partium prohibet constitutionem, ut quæ
   masculum non ad semen suscipiendum, sed ad id effundendum fecerit.
   Jeremias autem, hoc est, per ipsum loquens Spiritus, quando dicit:
   "Spelunca hyænæ facta est domus mea," [1495] id quod ex mortuis
   constabat corporibus detestans alimentum, sapienti allegoria
   reprehendit cultum simulacrorum: vere enim oportet ab idolis esse puram
   domum Dei viventis. Rursus Moyses lepore quoque vesci prohibet. Omni
   enim tempore coit lepus, et salit, assidente femina, earn a tergo
   aggrediens: est enim ex iis, quæ retro insiliunt. Concipit autem
   singulis mensibus, et superfetat; init autem, et parit; postquam autem
   peperit, statim a quovis initur lepore (neque enim uno contenta est
   matrimonio) et rursus concipit, adhuc lactans: habet enim matricem, cui
   sunt duo sinus, et non unus solus matricis vacuus sinus, est ei
   sufficiens sedes ad receptaculure coitus (quidquid enim est vacuum,
   desiderat repleri); verum accidit, ut cure uterum gerunt, altera pars
   matricis desiderio teneatur et libidine furiat; quocirca fiunt eis
   superfetationes. A vehementibus ergo appetitionibus, mutuisque
   congressionibus, et cure prægnantibus feminis conjunctionibus,
   alternisque initibus, puerorumque stupris, adulteriis et libidine
   abstinere, hujus nos ænigmatis adhortata est prohibitio. Idcirco
   aperte, et non per renigmata Moyses prohibuit, "Non fornicaberis; non
   moechaberis; pueris stuprum non inferes," [1496] inquiens. Logi itaque
   præscriptum totis viribus observandum, neque quidquam contra leges ullo
   modo faciendum est, neque mandata sunt infirmanda. Malæenim. cupiditati
   nomen est hubris, "petulantia;" et equum cupiditatis, "petulantem"
   vocavit Plato, cure legissit, "Facti estis mihi equi furentes in
   feminas." [1497] Libidines autem supplicium notum nobis facient illi,
   qui Sodomam accesserunt, angeli. Li eos, qui probro illos afficere
   voluerunt, una cum ipsa civitate combusserunt, evidenti hoc indicio
   ignem, qui est fructus libidinis, describentes. Quæenim veteribus
   acciderunt, sicut ante diximus, ad nos admonendos scripta sunt, ne
   eisdem teneamur vitiis, et caveamus, ne in poenas similes incidamus.
   Oportet autem filios existimare, pueros; uxores autem alienas intueri
   tanquam proprias filias: voluptates quippe continere, ventrique et iis
   quæ sunt infra ventrem, dominari, est maximi imperii. Si enim ne
   digitum quidem temere movere permittit sapienti ratio, ut confitentur
   Stoici, quomodo non multo magis iis, qui sapientiam persequuntur, in
   eam, qua coitur, particulam dominatus est obtinendus? Atque hac quidem
   de causa videtur esse nominatum pudendum, quod hac corporis parte
   magis, quam qualibet alia, cum pudore utendum sit; natura enim sicut
   alimentis, ita etiam legitimis nuptiis, quantum convenit, utile est, et
   decet, nobis uti permisit: permisit autem appetere liberorum
   procreationem. Quicumque autem, quod modum excedit, persequuntur,
   labuntur in eo quod est secundum naturam, per congressus, qui sunt
   præter leges, seipsos lædentes. Ante omnia enim recte habet, ut nunquam
   cure adolescentibus perinde ac cum feminis, Veneris utamur
   consuetudine. Et ideo "non esse in petris et lapidibus seminandum"
   dicit, qui a Moyse factus est philosophus, "quoniam nunquam actis
   radicibus genitalem sit semen naturam suscepturum." Logos itaque per
   Moysen appertissime præcepit: "Et cure masculo non dormies feminino
   concubitu: est enim abominatio." [1498] Accedit his, quod "ab omni
   quoque arvo feminino esse abstinendum" præterquam a proprio, ex divinis
   Scripturis colligens præclarus Plato consuluit lege illinc accepta: "Et
   uxori proximi tui non dabis concubitum seminis, ut polluaris apud
   ipsam. [1499] Irrita autem sunt et adulterina concubinarum semina. Ne
   semina, ubi non vis tibi nasci quod seminatum est. Neque ullam omnino
   tange mulierem, præterquam tuam ipsius uxorem," ex qua sola tibi licet
   carnis voluptates percipere ad suscipiendam legitimam successionem. Hæc
   enim Logo sola sunt legitima. Eis quidem certe, qui divini muneris in
   producendo opificio sunt participes, semen non est abjiciendum, neque
   injuria afficiendum, neque tanquam si cornibus semen mandes seminandum
   est. Hic ipse ergo Moyses cum ipsis quoque prohibet uxoribus congredi,
   si forte eas detineant purgationes menstruæ. Non enim purgamento
   corporis genitale semen, et quod mox homo futurum est, polluere est
   æquum, nec sordido materiæ profluvio, et, quæ expurgantur,
   inquinamentis inundare ac obruere; semen autem generationis degenerat,
   ineptumque redditur, simatricis sulcis privetur. Neque vero ullum
   unquam induxit veterum Hebræorum coeuntem cum sua uxore prægnante. Sola
   enim voluptas, si quis ea etiam utatur in conjugio, est præter leges,
   et injusta, eta ratione aliena. Rursus autem Moyses abducit viros a
   prægnantibus, quousque pepererint. Revera enim matrix sub vesica quidem
   collocata, super intestinum autem, quod rectum appellatur, posita,
   extendit collum inter humeros in vesica; et os colli, in quod venit
   semen, impletum occluditur, illa autem rursus inanis redditur, cum
   partu purgata fuerit: fructu autem deposito, deinde semen suscipit.
   Neque vero nobis turpe est ad auditorum utilitatem nominare partes, in
   quibus fit fetus conceptio, quæ quidem Deum fabricari non puduit.
   Matrix itaque sitiens filiorum procreationem, semen suscipit,
   probrosumque et vituperandum negat coitum, post sationem ore clauso
   omnino jam libidinem excludens. Ejus autem appetitiones, quæ prius in
   amicis versabantur complexibus, intro conversæ, in procreatione sobolis
   occupatæ, operantur una cum Opifice. Nefas est ergo operantem jam
   naturam adhuc molestia afficere, superflue ad petulantem prorumpendo
   libidinem. Petulantia autem, quæ multa quidem habet nomina, et multas
   species, cure ad hanc veneream intemperantiam deflexerit, lagneia, id
   est "lascivia," dicitur; quo nomine significatur libidinosa, publica,
   et incesta in coitum propensio: quæ cum aucta fuerit, magna simul
   morborum convenit multitudo, obsoniorum desiderium, vinolentia et amor
   in mulieres; luxus quoque, et simul universarum voluptatum studium; in
   quæ omnia tyrannidem obtinet cupidity. His autem cognatæ innumerabiles
   augentur affectiones, ex quibus mores intemperantes ad summum
   provehuntur. Dicit autem Scriptura: "Parantur intemperantibus flagella,
   et supplicia humeris insipientium:" [1500] vires intemperantiæ, ejusque
   constantem tolerantiam, vocans "humeros insipientium." Quocirca, "Amove
   a servis tuis spes inanes, et indecoras," inquit, "cupiditates averte a
   me. Ventris appetitio et coitus ne me apprehendant." [1501]

   Longe ergo sunt arcenda multifaria insidiatorum maleficia; non ad solam
   enim Cratetis Peram, sed etiam ad nostram civitatem non navigat stultus
   parasitus, nec scortator libidinosus, qui posteriori delectatur parte:
   non dolosa meretrix, nec ulla ejusmodi alia voluptatis bellua. Multa
   ergo nobis per totam vitam seminetur, quæ bona sit et honesta,
   occupatio. In summa ergo, vel jungi matrimonio, vel omnino a matrimonio
   purum esse oportet; in quæ stione enim id versatur, et hoc nobis
   declaratum est in libro De continentia. Quod si hoc ipsum, an ducenda
   sit uxor. veniat in considerationem: quomodo libere permittetur,
   quemadmodum nutrimento, ita etiam coitu semper uti, tanquam re
   necessaria? Ex eo ergo videri possunt nervi tanquam stamina distrahi,
   et in vehementi congressus intensione disrumpi. Jam vero offundit etiam
   caliginem sensibus, et vires enervat. Patet hoc et in animantibus
   rationis expertibus, et in iis, quæ in exercitatione versantur,
   corporibus; quorum hi quidem, qui abstinent, in certaminibus superant
   adversarios; illa vero a coitu abducta circumaguntur, et tantum non
   trahuntur, omnibus viribus et omni impetu tandem quasi enervata.
   "Parvam epilepsiam" dicebat "coitum" sophista Abderites morbum
   immedicabilem existimans. Annon enim consequuntur resolutiones, quæ
   exinanitionis ejusque, quod abscedit, magnitudini ascribuntur? "homo
   enim ex homine nascitur et evellitur." Vide damni magnitudinem: totus
   homo per exinanitionem coitus abstrahitur. Dicit enim: Hoc nunc os ex
   ossibus meis, et caro ex came mea." [1502] Homo ergo tantum exinanitur
   semine, quantus videtur corpore; est enim generationis initium id, quod
   recedit: quin etiam conturbat ebullitio materiæ et compagem corporis
   labefactat et commovet. Lepide ergo ille, qui interroganti, "Quomodo
   adhuc se haberet ad res venereas," respondit: "Bona verba, quæ so: ego
   vero lubentissime isthinc, tanquam ab agresti et insano domino,
   profugi." Verum concedatur quidem et admittatur matrimonium: vult enim
   Dominus humanum genus repleri; seal non dicit, Estote libidinosi: nec
   vos, tanquam ad coitum natos, voluit esse deditos voluptati. Pudore
   autem nos afficiat Pædagogus, clamans per Ezechielem: "Circumcidamini
   fornicationem vestram." Aliquod tempus ad seminandum opportunum habent
   quoque rationis expertia animantia. Aliter autem coire, quam ad
   liberorum procreationem, est facere injuriam naturæ; [1503] qua quidem
   oportetmagistra, quas prudenter introducit temporis commoditates,
   diligenter observare, senectutem, inquam, et puerilem ætatem. His enim
   nondum concessit, illos autem non vult amplius uxores ducere. Seal non
   vult homines semper dare operam matrimonio. Matrimonium autem est
   filiorum procreationis appetitio, non inordinata seminis excretio, quæ
   est et præter leges eta ratione aliena. Secundum naturam autem nobis
   vita universa processerit, [1504] si et ab initio cupiditates
   contineamus, et hominum genus, quod ex divina providentia nascitur,
   improbis et malitiosis non tollamus artibus: eæenim, ut fornicatiohem
   celent, exitialia medicamenta adhibentes, quæ prorsus in perniciem
   ducunt, simul cum fetu omnem humanitatem perdunt. Cæterum, quibus
   uxores ducere concessum est, iis Pædagogo opus fuerit, ut non interdiu
   mystica naturæ celebrentur orgia, nec ut aliquis ex ecclesia, verbi
   gratia, aut ex foro mane rediens, galli more coeat, quando orationis,
   et lectionis, et eorum quæ interdiu facere convenit, operum tempus est.
   Vespere autem oportet post convivium quiescere, et post gratiarum
   actionem, quæ fit Deo pro bonis quæ percepimus. Non semper autem
   concedit tempus natura, ut peragatur congressus matrimonii; est enim eo
   desiderabilior conjunctio, quo diuturnior. Neque vero noctu, tanquam in
   tenebris, immodeste sese ac imtemperanter gerere oportet, sed
   verecundia, ut quæ sit lux rationis, in animo est includenda. Nihil
   enim a Penelope telam texente differemus, si interdiu quidem texamus
   dogmata temperantiæ; noctu autem ea resolvamus, cum in cubile
   venerimus. Si enim honestatem exercere oportet, multo magis tuæ uxori
   honestas est ostendenda, inhonestas vitando conjunctiones: et quod
   caste cum proximis verseris, fide dignum e domo adsit testimonium. Non
   enim potest aliquid honestum ab ea existimari, apud quam honestas in
   acribus illis non probatur certo quasi testimonio voluptatibus.
   Benevolentia autem quæ præceps fertur ad congressionem, exiguo tempore
   floret, et cum corpore consenescit; nonnunquam autem etiam præ
   senescit, flaccescente jam libidine, quando matrimonialem temperantiam
   meretriciæ vitiaverint libidines. Amantium enim corda sunt volucria,
   amorisque irritamenta exstinguuntur sæpe poenitentia; amorque sæpe
   vertitur in odium, quando reprehensionera senserit satietas.
   Impudicorum vero verborum, et turpium figurarum, meretriciorumque
   osculomm, et hujusmodi lasciviarum nomina ne sunt quidem memoranda,
   beatum sequentibus Apostolum, qui aperte dicit: "Fornicatio autem et
   omnis immunditia, vel plura habendi cupiditas, ne nominetur quidem in
   vobis, sicut decet saneros." [1505] Recte ergo videtur dixisse
   quispiam: "Nulli quidem profuit coitus, recte autem cum eo agitur, quem
   non læserit." Nam et qui legitimus, est periculosus, nisi quatenus in
   liberorum procreatione versatur. De eo autem, qui est præter leges,
   dicit Scriptura: "Mulier meretrix apro similis reputabitur. Quæautem
   viro subjecta est, turris est mortis iis, qui ea utuntur." Capro, vel
   apro, meretricis comparavit affectionem. "Mortem" autem dixit "quæ
   sitam," adulterium, quod committitur in meretrice, quæ custoditur.
   "Domum" autem, et "urbem," in qua suam exercent intemperantiam. Quin
   etiam quæ est apud vos poetica, quodammodo ea exprobrans, scribit:--


   Tecum et adulterium est, tecum coitusque nefandus,

   Foedus, femineusque, urbs pessima, plane impura.

   Econtra autem pudicos admiratur:--


   Quos desiderium tenuit nec turpe cubilis

   Alterius, nec tetra invisaque stupra tulerunt

   Ulla unquam maribus.

   [1506] For many think such things to be pleasures only which are
   against nature, such as these sins of theirs. And those who are better
   than they, know them to be sins, but are overcome by pleasures, and
   darkness is the veil of their vicious practices. For he violates his
   marriage adulterously who uses it in a meretricious way, and hears not
   the voice of the Instructor, crying, "The man who ascends his bed, who
   says in his soul, Who seeth me? darkness is around me, and the walls
   are my covering, and no one sees my sins. Why do I fear lest the
   Highest will remember?" [1507] Most wretched is such a man, dreading
   men's eyes alone, and thinking that he will escape the observation of
   God. "For he knoweth not," says the Scripture, "that brighter ten
   thousand times than the sun are the eyes of the Most High, which look
   on all the ways of men, and cast their glance into hidden parts." Thus
   again the Instructor threatens them, speaking by Isaiah: "Woe be to
   those who take counsel in secret, and say, Who seeth us?" [1508] For
   one may escape the light of sense, but that of the mind it is
   impossible to escape. For how, says Heraclitus, can one escape the
   notice of that which never sets? Let us by no means, then, veil our
   selves with the darkness; for the light dwells in us. "For the
   darkness," it is said, "comprehendeth it not." [1509] And the very
   night itself is illuminated by temperate reason. The thoughts of good
   men Scripture has named "sleepless lamps;" [1510] although for one to
   attempt even to practice concealment, with reference to what he does,
   is confessedly to sin. And every one who sins, directly wrongs not so
   much his neighbour if he commits adultery, as himself, because he has
   committed adultery, besides making himself worse and less thought of.
   For he who sins, in the degree in which he sins, becomes worse and is
   of less estimation than before; and he who has been overcome by base
   pleasures, has now licentiousness wholly attached to him. Wherefore he
   who commits fornication is wholly dead to God, and is abandoned by the
   Word as a dead body by the spirit. For what is holy, as is right,
   abhors to be polluted. But it is always lawful for the pure to touch
   the pure. Do not, I pray, put off modesty at the same time that you put
   off your clothes; because it is never right for the just man to divest
   himself of continence. For, lo, this mortal shall put on immortality;
   when the insatiableness of desire, which rushes into licentiousness,
   being trained to self-restraint, and made free from the love of
   corruption, shall consign the man to everlasting chastity. "For in this
   world they marry and and are given in marriage." [1511] But having done
   with the works of the flesh, and having been clothed with immortality,
   the flesh itself being pure, we pursue after that which is according to
   the measure of the angels.

   Thus in the Philebus, Plato, who had been the disciple of the barbarian
   [1512] philosophy, mystically called those Atheists who destroy and
   pollute, as far as in them lies, the Deity dwelling in them--that is,
   the Logos--by association with their vices. Those, therefore, who are
   consecrated to God must never live mortally (thnetos). "Nor," as Paul
   says, "is it meet to make the members of Christ the members of an
   harlot; nor must the temple of God be made the temple of base
   affections." [1513] Remember the four and twenty thousand that were
   rejected for fornication. [1514] But the experiences of those who have
   committed fornication, as I have already said, are types which correct
   our lusts. Moreover, the Pædagogue warns us most distinctly: "Go not
   after thy lusts, and abstain from thine appetites; [1515] for wine and
   women will remove the wise; and he that cleaves to harlots will become
   more daring. Corruption and the worm shall inherit him, and he shall be
   held up as public example to greater shame." [1516] And again--for he
   wearies not of doing good--"He who averts his eyes from pleasure crowns
   his life."

   Non est ergo justum vinci a rebus venereis, nec libidinibus stolide
   inhiare, nec a ratione alienis appetitionibus moveri, nec desiderare
   pollui. Ei autem soli, qui uxorem duxit, ut qui tunc sit agricola,
   serere permissum est; quando tempus sementem admittit. Adversus aliam
   autem intemperantiam, optimum quidem est medicamentum, ratio. [1517]
   Fert etiam auxilium penuria satietatis, per quam accensæ libidines
   prosiliunt ad voluptates.

      Chapter XI. [1518] --On Clothes.

   Wherefore neither are we to provide for ourselves costly clothing any
   more than variety of food. The Lord Himself, therefore, dividing His
   precepts into what relates to the body, the soul, and thirdly, external
   things, counsels us to provide external things on account of the body;
   and manages the body by the soul (psuke), and disciplines the soul,
   saying, "Take no thought for your life (psuke) what ye shall eat; nor
   yet for your body, what ye shall put on; for the life is more than
   meat, and the body more than raiment." [1519] And He adds a plain
   example of instruction: "Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor
   reap, which have neither storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them."
   [1520] "Are ye not better than the fowls?" [1521] Thus far as to food.
   Similarly He enjoins with respect to clothing, which belongs to the
   third division, that of things external, saying, "Consider the lilies,
   how they spin not, nor weave. But I say unto you, that not even Solomon
   was arrayed as one of these."" [1522] And Solomon the king plumed
   himself exceedingly on his riches.

   What, I ask, more graceful, more gay-coloured, than flowers? What, I
   say, more delightful than lilies or roses? "And if God so clothe the
   grass, which is to-day in the field, and to-morrow is cast into the
   oven, how much more will He clothe you, O ye of little faith!" [1523]
   Here the particle what (ti) banishes variety in food. For this is shown
   from the Scripture, "Take no thought what things ye shall eat, or what
   things ye shall drink." For to take thought of these things argues
   greed and luxury. Now eating, considered merely by itself, is the sign
   of necessity; repletion, as we have said, of want. Whatever is beyond
   that, is the sign of superfluity. And what is superfluous, Scripture
   declares to be of the devil. The subjoined expression makes the meaning
   plain. For having said, "Seek not what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
   drink," He added, "Neither be ye of doubtful (or lofty) [1524] mind."
   Now pride and luxury make men waverers (or raise them aloft) from the
   truth; and the voluptuousness, which indulges in superfluities, leads
   away from the truth. Wherefore He says very beautifully, "And all these
   things do the nations of the world seek after." [1525] The nations are
   the dissolute and the foolish. And what are these things which He
   specifies? Luxury, voluptuousness, rich cooking, dainty feeding,
   gluttony. These are the "What?" And of bare sustenance, dry and moist,
   as being necessaries, He says, "Your Father knoweth that ye need
   these." And if, in a word, we are naturally given to seeking, let us
   not destroy the faculty of seeking by directing it to luxury, but let
   us excite it to the discovery of truth. For He says, "Seek ye the
   kingdom of God, and the materials of sustenance shall be added to you."

   If, then, He takes away anxious care for clothes and food, and
   superfluities in general, as unnecessary; what are we to imagine ought
   to be said of love of ornament, and dyeing of wool, and variety of
   colours, and fastidiousness about gems, and exquisite working of gold,
   and still more, of artificial hair and wreathed curls; and furthermore,
   of staining the eyes, and plucking out hairs, and painting with rouge
   and white lead, and dyeing of the hair, and the wicked arts that are
   employed in such deceptions? May we not very well suspect, that what
   was quoted a little above respecting the grass, has been said of those
   unornamental lovers of ornaments? For the field is the world, and we
   who are bedewed by the grace of God are the grass; and though cut down,
   we spring up again, as will be shown at greater length in the book On
   the Resurrection. But hay figuratively designates the vulgar rabble,
   attached to ephemeral pleasure, flourishing for a little, loving
   ornament, loving praise, and being everything but truth-loving, good
   for nothing but to be burned with fire. "There was a certain man," said
   the Lord, narrating, "very rich, who was clothed in purple and scarlet,
   enjoying himself splendidly every day." This was the hay. "And a
   certain poor man named Lazarus was laid at the rich man's gate, full of
   sores, desiring to be filled with the crumbs which fell from the rich
   man's table." This is the grass. Well, the rich man was punished in
   Hades, being made partaker of the fire; while the other flourished
   again in the Father's bosom. I admire that ancient city of the
   Lacedæmonians which permitted harlots alone to wear flowered clothes,
   and ornaments of gold, interdicting respectable women from love of
   ornament, and allowing courtesans alone to deck themselves. On the
   other hand, the archons of the Athenians, who affected a polished mode
   of life, forgetting their manhood, wore tunics reaching to the feet,
   and had on the crobulus--a kind of knot of the hair--adorned with a
   fastening of gold grasshoppers, to show their origin from the soil,
   forsooth, in the ostentation of licentiousness. Now rivalry of these
   archons extended also to the other Ionians, whom Homer, to show their
   effeminancy, calls "Long-robed." Those, therefore, who are devoted to
   the image of the beautiful, that is, love of finery, not the beautiful
   itself, and who under a fair name again practice idolatry, are to be
   banished far from the truth, as those who by opinion, [1526] not
   knowledge, dream of the nature of the beautiful; and so life here is to
   them only a deep sleep of ignorance; from which it becomes us to rouse
   ourselves and haste to that which is truly beautiful and comely, and
   desire to grasp this alone, leaving the ornaments of earth to the
   world, and bidding them farewell before we fall quite asleep. I say,
   then, that man requires clothes for nothing else than the covering of
   the body, for defence against excess of cold and intensity of heat,
   lest the inclemency of the air injure us. And if this is the object of
   clothing, see that one kind be not assigned to men and another to
   women. For it is common to both to be covered, as it is to eat and
   drink. The necessity, then, being common, we judge that the provision
   ought to be similar. For as it is common to both to require things to
   cover them, so also their coverings ought to be similar; although such
   a covering ought to be assumed as is requisite for covering the eyes of
   women. For if the female sex, on account of their weakness, desire
   more, we ought to blame the habit of that evil training, by which often
   men reared up in bad habits become more effeminate than women. But this
   must not be yielded to. And if some accommodation is to be made, they
   may be permitted to use softer clothes, provided they put out of the
   way fabrics foolishly thin, and of curious texture in weaving; bidding
   farewell to embroidery of gold and Indian silks and elaborate Bombyces
   (silks), which is at first a worm, then from it is produced a hairy
   caterpillar; after which the creature suffers a new transformation into
   a third form which they call larva, from which a long filament is
   produced, as the spider's thread from the spider. For these superfluous
   and diaphanous materials are the proof of a weak mind, covering as they
   do the shame of the body with a slender veil. For luxurious clothing,
   which cannot conceal the shape of the body, is no more a covering. For
   such clothing, falling close to the body, takes its form more easily,
   and adhering as it were to the flesh, receives its shape, and marks out
   the woman's figure, so that the whole make of the body is visible to
   spectators, though not seeing the body itself. [1527]

   Dyeing of clothes is also to be rejected. For it is remote both from
   necessity and truth, in addition to the fact that reproach in manners
   spring from it. [1528] For the use of colours is not beneficial, for
   they are of no service against cold; nor has it anything for covering
   more than other clothing, except the opprobrium alone. And the
   agreeableness of the colour afflicts greedy eyes, inflaming them to
   senseless blindness. But for those who are white and unstained within,
   it is most suitable to use white and simple garments. Clearly and
   plainly, therefore, Daniel the prophet says, "Thrones were set, and
   upon them sat one like the Ancient of days, and His vesture was white
   as snow." [1529] The Apocalypse says also that the Lord Himself
   appeared wearing such a robe. It says also, "I saw the souls of those
   that had witnessed, beneath the altar, and there was given to each a
   white robe." [1530] And if it were necessary to seek for any other
   colour, the natural colour of truth should suffice. [1531] But garments
   which are like flowers are to be abandoned to Bacchic fooleries, and to
   those of the rites of initiation, along with purple and silver plate,
   as the comic poet says:--


   "Useful for tragedians, not for life."

   And our life ought to be anything rather than a pageant. Therefore the
   dye of Sardis, and another of olive, and another green, a
   rose-coloured, and scarlet, and ten thousand other dyes, have been
   invented with much trouble for mischievous voluptuousness. Such
   clothing is for looking at, not for covering. Garments, too, variegated
   with gold, and those that are purple, and that piece of luxury which
   has its name from beasts (figured on it), and that saffron-coloured
   ointment-dipped robe, and those costly and many-coloured garments of
   flaring membranes, we are to bid farewell to, with the art itself. "For
   what prudent thing can these women have done," says the comedy, "who
   sit covered with flowers, wearing a saffron-coloured dress, [1532]
   painted?"

   The Instructor expressly admonishes, "Boast not of the clothing of your
   garment, and be not elated on account of any glory, as it is unlawful."
   [1533]

   Accordingly, deriding those who are clothed in luxurious garments, He
   says in the Gospel: "Lo, they who live in gorgeous apparel and luxury
   are in earthly palaces." [1534] He says in perishable palaces, where
   are love of display, love of popularity, and flattery and deceit. But
   those that wait at the court of heaven around the King of all, are
   sanctified in the immortal vesture of the Spirit, that is, the flesh,
   and so put on incorruptibility.

   As therefore she who is unmarried devotes herself to God alone, and her
   care is not divided, but the chaste married woman divides her life
   between God and her husband, while she who is otherwise disposed is
   devoted entirely to marriage, that is, to passion: in the same way I
   think the chaste wife, when she devotes herself to her husband,
   sincerely serves God; but when she becomes fond of finery, she falls
   away from God and from chaste wedlock, exchanging her husband for the
   world, after the fashion of that Argive courtesan, I mean Eriphyle,--


   "Who received gold prized above her dear husband."

   Wherefore I admire the Ceian sophist, [1535] who delineated like and
   suitable images of Virtue and Vice, representing the former of these,
   viz. Virtue, standing simply, white-robed and pure, adorned with
   modesty alone (for such ought to be the true wife, dowered with
   modesty). But the other, viz. Vice, on the contrary, he introduces
   dressed in superfluous attire, brightened up with colour not her own;
   and her gait and mien are depicted as studiously framed to give
   pleasure, forming a sketch of wanton women.

   But he who follows the Word will not addict himself to any base
   pleasure; wherefore also what is useful in the article of dress is to
   be preferred. And if the Word, speaking of the Lord by David, sings,
   "The daughters of kings made Thee glad by honour; the queen stood at
   Thy right hand, clad in cloth of gold, girt with golden fringes," it is
   not luxurious raiment that he indicates; but he shows the immortal
   adornment, woven of faith, of those that have found mercy, that is, the
   Church; in which the guileless Jesus shines conspicuous as gold, and
   the elect are the golden tassels. And if such must be woven [1536] for
   the women, let us weave apparel pleasant and soft to the touch, not
   flowered, like pictures, to delight the eye. For the picture fades in
   course of time, and the washing and steeping in the medicated juices of
   the dye wear away the wool, and render the fabrics of the garments
   weak; and this is not favourable to economy. It is the height of
   foolish ostentation to be in a flutter about peploi, and xystides, and
   ephaptides, [1537] and "cloaks," and tunics, and "what covers shame,"
   says Homer. For, in truth, I am ashamed when I see so much wealth
   lavished on the covering of the nakedness. For primeval man in Paradise
   provided a covering for his shame of branches and leaves; and now,
   since sheep have been created for us, let us not be as silly as sheep,
   but trained by the Word, let us condemn sumptuousness of clothing,
   saying, "Ye are sheep's wool." Though Miletus boast, and Italy be
   praised, and the wool, about which many rave, be protected beneath
   skins, [1538] yet are we not to set our hearts on it.

   The blessed John, despising the locks of sheep as savouring of luxury,
   chose "camel's hair," and was clad in it, making himself an example of
   frugality and simplicity of life. For he also "ate locusts and wild
   honey," [1539] sweet and spiritual fare; preparing, as he was, the
   lowly and chaste ways of the Lord. For how possibly could he have worn
   a purple robe, who turned away from the pomp of cities, and retired to
   the solitude of the desert, to live in calmness with God, far from all
   frivolous pursuits--from all false show of good--from all meanness?
   Elias used a sheepskin mantle, and fastened the sheepskin with a girdle
   made of hair. [1540] And Esaias, another prophet, was naked and
   barefooted, [1541] and often was clad in sackcloth, the garb of
   humility. And if you call Jeremiah, he had only "a linen girdle."
   [1542]

   For as well-nurtured bodies, when stripped, show their vigour more
   manifestly, so also beauty of character shows its magnanimity, when not
   involved in ostentatious fooleries. But to drag one's clothes, letting
   them down to the soles of his feet, is a piece of consummate foppery,
   impeding activity in walking, the garment sweeping the surface dirt of
   the ground like a broom; since even those emasculated creatures the
   dancers, who transfer their dumb shameless profligacy to the stage, do
   not despise the dress which flows away to such indignity; whose curious
   vestments, and appendages of fringes, and elaborate motions of figures,
   show the trailing of sordid effeminacy. [1543]

   If one should adduce the garment of the Lord reaching down to the foot,
   that many-flowered coat [1544] shows the flowers of wisdom, the varied
   and unfading Scriptures, the oracles of the Lord, resplendent with the
   rays of truth. In such another robe the Spirit arrayed the Lord through
   David, when he sang thus: "Thou wert clothed with confession and
   comeliness, putting on light as a garment." [1545]

   As, then, in the fashioning of our clothes, we must keep clear of all
   strangeness, so in the use of them we must beware of extravagance. For
   neither is it seemly for the clothes to be above the knee, as they say
   was the case with the Lacedæmonian virgins; [1546] nor is it becoming
   for any part of a woman to be exposed. Though you may with great
   propriety use the language addressed to him who said, "Your arm is
   beautiful; yes, but it is not for the public gaze. Your thighs are
   beautiful; but, was the reply, for my husband alone. And your face is
   comely. Yes; but only for him who has married me." But I do not wish
   chaste women to afford cause for such praises to those who, by praises,
   hunt after grounds of censure; and not only because it is prohibited to
   expose the ankle, but because it has also been enjoined that the head
   should be veiled and the face covered; for it is a wicked thing for
   beauty to be a snare to men. Nor is it seemly for a woman to wish to
   make herself conspicuous, by using a purple veil. Would it were
   possible to abolish purple in dress, so as not to turn the eyes of
   spectators on the face of those that wear it! But the women, in the
   manufacture of all the rest of their dress, have made everything of
   purple, thus inflaming the lusts. And, in truth, those women who are
   crazy about these stupid and luxurious purples, "purple (dark) death
   has seized," [1547] according to the poetic saying. On account of this
   purple, then, Tyre and Sidon, and the vicinity of the Lacedæmonian Sea,
   are very much desired; and their dyers and purple-fishers, and the
   purple fishes themselves, because their blood produces purple, are held
   in high esteem. But crafty women and effeminate men, who blend these
   deceptive dyes with dainty fabrics, carry their insane desires beyond
   all bounds, and export their fine linens no longer from Egypt, but some
   other kinds from the land of the Hebrews and the Cilicians. I say
   nothing of the linens made of Amorgos [1548] and Byssus. Luxury has
   outstripped nomenclature.

   The covering ought, in my judgment, to show that which is covered to be
   better than itself, as the image is superior to the temple, the soul to
   the body, and the body to the clothes. [1549] But now, quite the
   contrary, the body of these ladies, if sold, would never fetch a
   thousand Attic drachms. Buying, as they do, a single dress at the price
   of ten thousand talents, they prove themselves to be of less use and
   less value than cloth. Why in the world do you seek after what is rare
   and costly, in preference to what is at hand and cheap? It is because
   you know not what is really beautiful, what is really good, and seek
   with eagerness shows instead of realities from fools who, like people
   out of their wits, imagine black to be white.

      Chap. XII.--On Shoes.

   Women fond of display act in the same manner with regard to shoes,
   showing also in this matter great luxuriousness. Base, in truth, are
   those sandals on which golden ornaments are fastened; but they are
   thought worth having nails driven into the soles in winding rows. Many,
   too, carve on them [1550] amorous embraces, as if they would by their
   walk communicate to the earth harmonious movement, and impress on it
   the wantonness of their spirit. Farewell, therefore, must be bidden to
   gold-plated and jewelled mischievous devices of sandals, and Attic and
   Sicyonian half-boots, and Persian and Tyrrhenian buskins; and setting
   before us the right aim, as is the habit with our truth, we are bound
   to select what is in accordance with nature.

   For the use of shoes is partly for covering, partly for defence in case
   of stumbling against objects, and for saving the sole of the foot from
   the roughness of hilly paths.

   Women are to be allowed a white shoe, except when on a journey, and
   then a greased shoe must be used. When on a journey, they require
   nailed shoes. Further, they ought for the most part to wear shoes; for
   it is not suitable for the foot to be shown naked: besides, woman is a
   tender thing, easily hurt. But for a man bare feet are quite in
   keeping, except when he is on military service. "For being shod is near
   neighbour to being bound." [1551]

   To go with bare feet is most suitable for exercise, and best adapted
   for health and ease, unless where necessity prevents. But if we are not
   on a journey, and cannot endure bare feet, we may use slippers or white
   shoes; dusty-foots [1552] the Attics called them, on account of their
   bringing the feet near the dust, as I think. As a witness for
   simplicity in shoes let John suffice, who avowed that "he was not
   worthy to unloose the latchet of the Lord's shoes." [1553] For he who
   exhibited to the Hebrews the type of the true philosophy wore no
   elaborate shoes. What else this may imply, will be shown elsewhere.

      Chapter XIII--Against Excessive Fondness for Jewels and Gold Ornaments.

   It is childish to admire excessively dark or green stones, and things
   cast out by the sea on foreign shores, particles of the earth. [1554]
   For to rush after stones that are pellucid and of peculiar colours, and
   stained glass, is only characteristic of silly people, who are
   attracted by things that have a striking show. Thus children, on seeing
   the fire, rush to it, attracted by its brightness; not understanding
   through senselessness the danger of touching it. Such is the case with
   the stones which silly women wear fastened to chains and set in
   necklaces, amethysts, ceraunites, jaspers, topaz, and the Milesian


   "Emerald, most precious ware."

   And the highly prized pearl has invaded the woman's apartments to an
   extravagant extent. This is produced in a kind of oyster like mussels,
   and is about the bigness of a fish's eye of large size. And the
   wretched creatures are not ashamed at having bestowed the greatest
   pains about this little oyster, when they might adorn themselves with
   the sacred jewel, the Word of God, whom the Scripture has somewhere
   called a pearl, the pure and pellucid Jesus, the eye that watches in
   the flesh,--the transparent Word, by whom the flesh, regenerated by
   water, becomes precious. For that oyster that is in the water covers
   the flesh all round, and out of it is produced the pearl.

   We have heard, too, that the Jerusalem above is walled with sacred
   stones; and we allow that the twelve gates of the celestial city, by
   being made like precious stones, indicate the transcendent grace of the
   apostolic voice. For the colours are laid on in precious stones, and
   these colours are precious; while the other parts remain of earthy
   material. With these symbolically, as is meet, the city of the saints,
   which is spiritually built, is walled. By that brilliancy of stones,
   therefore, is meant the inimitable brilliancy of the spirit, the
   immortality and sanctity of being. But these women, who comprehend not
   the symbolism of Scripture, gape all they can for jewels, adducing the
   astounding apology, "Why may I not use what God hath exhibited?" and,
   "I have it by me, why may I not enjoy it?" and, "For whom were these
   things made, then, if not for us?" Such are the utterances of those who
   are totally ignorant of the will of God. For first necessaries, such as
   water and air, He supplies free to all; and what is not necessary He
   has hid in the earth and water. Wherefore ants dig, and griffins guard
   gold, and the sea hides the pearl-stone. But ye busy yourselves about
   what you need not. Behold, the whole heaven is lighted up, and ye seek
   not God; but gold which is hidden, and jewels, are dug up by those
   among us who are condemned to death.

   But you also oppose Scripture, seeing it expressly cries "Seek first
   the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you."
   [1555] But if all things have been conferred on you, and all things
   allowed you, and "if all things are lawful, yet all things are not
   expedient," [1556] says the apostle. God brought our race into
   communion by first imparting what was His own, when He gave His own
   Word, common to all, and made all things for all. All things therefore
   are common, and not for the rich to appropriate an undue share. That
   expression, therefore, "I possess, and possess in abundance: why then
   should I not enjoy?" is suitable neither to the man, nor to society.
   But more worthy of love is that: "I have: why should I not give to
   those who need?" For such an one--one who fulfils the command, "Thou
   shalt love thy neighbour as thyself"--is perfect. For this is the true
   luxury--the treasured wealth. But that which is squandered on foolish
   lusts is to be reckoned waste, not expenditure. For God has given to
   us, I know well, the liberty of use, but only so far as necessary; and
   He has determined that the use should be common. And it is monstrous
   for one to live in luxury, while many are in want. How much more
   glorious is it to do good to many, than to live sumptuously! How much
   wiser to spend money on human being, [1557] than on jewels and gold!
   How much more useful to acquire decorous friends, than lifeless
   ornaments! Whom have lands ever benefited so much as conferring favours
   has? It remains for us, therefore, to do away with this allegation:
   Who, then, will have the more sumptuous things, if all select the
   simpler? Men, I would say, if they make use of them impartially and
   indifferently. But if it be impossible for all to exercise
   self-restraint, yet, with a view to the use of what is necessary, we
   must seek after what can be most readily procured, bidding a long
   farewell to these superfluities.

   In fine, they must accordingly utterly cast off ornaments as girls'
   gewgaws, rejecting adornment itself entirely. For they ought to be
   adorned within, and show the inner woman beautiful. For in the soul
   alone are beauty and deformity shown. Wherefore also only the virtuous
   man is really beautiful and good. And it is laid down as a dogma, that
   only the beautiful is good. And excellence alone appears through the
   beautiful body, and blossoms out in the flesh, exhibiting the amiable
   comeliness of self-control, whenever the character like a beam of light
   gleams in the form. For the beauty of each plant and animal consists in
   its individual excellence. And the excellence of man is righteousness,
   and temperance, and manliness, and godliness. The beautiful man is,
   then, he who is just, temperate, and in a word, good, not he who is
   rich. But now even the soldiers wish to be decked with gold, not having
   read that poetical saying:--


   "With childish folly to the war he came,

   Laden with store of gold." [1558]

   But the love of ornament, which is far from caring for virtue, but
   claims the body for itself, when the love of the beautiful has changed
   to empty show, is to be utterly expelled. For applying things
   unsuitable to the body, as if they were suitable, begets a practice of
   lying and a habit of falsehood; and shows not what is decorous, simple,
   and truly childlike, but what is pompous, luxurious, and effeminate.
   But these women obscure true beauty, shading it with gold. And they
   know not how great is their transgression, in fastening around
   themselves ten thousand rich chains; as they say that among the
   barbarians malefactors are bound with gold. The women seem to me to
   emulate these rich prisoners. For is not the golden necklace a collar,
   and do not the necklets which they call catheters [1559] occupy the
   place of chains? and indeed among the Attics they are called by this
   very name. The ungraceful things round the feet of women, Philemon in
   the Synephebus called ankle-fetters:--


   "Conspicuous garments, and a kind of a golden fetter."

   What else, then, is this coveted adorning of yourselves, O ladies, but
   the exhibiting of yourselves fettered? For if the material does away
   with the reproach, the endurance [of your fetters] is a thing
   indifferent. To me, then, those who voluntarily put themselves into
   bonds seem to glory in rich calamities.

   Perchance also it is such chains that the poetic fable says were thrown
   around Aphrodite when committing adultery, referring to ornaments as
   nothing but the badge of adultery. For Homer called those, too, golden
   chains. But new women are not ashamed to wear the most manifest badges
   of the evil one. For as the serpent deceived Eve, so also has ornament
   of gold maddened other women to vicious practices, using as a bait the
   form of the serpent, and by fashioning lampreys and serpents for
   decoration. Accordingly the comic poet Nicostratus says, "Chains,
   collars, rings, bracelets, serpents, anklets, earrings." [1560]

   In terms of strongest censure, therefore, Aristophanes in the
   Thesmophoriazousæ exhibits the whole array of female ornament in a
   catalogue:--


   "Snoods, fillets, natron, and steel;

   Pumice-stone, band, back-band,

   Back-veil, paint, necklaces,

   Paints for the eyes, soft garment, hair-net,

   Girdle, shawl, fine purple border,

   Long robe, tunic, Barathrum, round tunic."

   But I have not yet mentioned the principal of them. Then what?


   "Ear-pendants, jewelry, ear-rings;

   Mallow-coloured cluster-shaped anklets;

   Buckles, clasps, necklets,

   Fetters, seals, chains, rings, powders,

   Bosses, bands, olisbi, Sardian stones,

   Fans, helicters."

   I am weary and vexed at enumerating the multitude of ornaments; [1561]
   and I am compelled to wonder how those who bear such a burden are not
   worried to death. O foolish trouble! O silly craze for display! They
   squander meretriciously wealth on what is disgraceful; and in their
   love for ostentation disfigure God's gifts, emulating the art of the
   evil one. The rich man hoarding up in his barns, and saying to himself,
   "Thou hast much goods laid up for many years; eat, drink, be merry,"
   the Lord in the Gospel plainly called "fool." "For this night they
   shall take of thee thy soul; whose then shall those things which thou
   hast prepared be?" [1562]

   Apelles, the painter, seeing one of his pupils painting a figure loaded
   with gold colour to represent Helen, said to him, "Boy, being incapable
   of painting her beautiful, you have made her rich."

   Such Helens are the ladies of the present day, not truly beautiful, but
   richly got up. To these the Spirit prophesies by Zephaniah: "And their
   silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of
   the Lord's anger." [1563]

   But for those women who have been trained under Christ, it is suitable
   to adorn themselves not with gold, but with the Word, through whom
   alone the gold comes to light. [1564]

   Happy, then, would have been the ancient Hebrews, had they cast away
   their women's ornaments, or only melted them; but having cast their
   gold into the form of an ox, and paid it idolatrous worship, they
   consequently reap no advantage either from their art or their attempt.
   But they taught our women most expressively to keep clear of ornaments.
   The lust which commits fornication with gold becomes an idol, and is
   tested by fire; for which alone luxury is reserved, as being an idol,
   not a reality. [1565] Hence the Word, upbraiding the Hebrews by the
   prophet, says, "They made to Baal things of silver and gold," that is,
   ornaments. And most distinctly threatening, He says, "I will punish her
   for the days of Baalim, in which they offered sacrifice for her, and
   she put on her earrings and her necklaces." [1566] And He subjoined the
   cause of the adornment, when He said, "And she went after her lovers,
   but forgot Me, saith the Lord. [1567]

   Resigning, therefore, these baubles to the wicked master of cunning
   himself, let us not take part in this meretricious adornment, nor
   commit idolatry through a specious pretext. Most admirably, therefore,
   the blessed Peter [1568] says, "In like manner also, that women adorn
   themselves not with braids, or gold, or costly array, but (which
   becometh women professing godliness) with good works." For it is with
   reason that he bids decking of themselves to be kept far from them.
   For, granting that they are beautiful, nature suffices. Let not art
   contend against nature; that is, let not falsehood strive with truth.
   And if they are by nature ugly, they are convicted, by the things they
   apply to themselves, of what they do not possess [i.e., of the want of
   beauty]. It is suitable, therefore, for women who serve Christ to adopt
   simplicity. For in reality simplicity provides for sanctity, by
   reducing redundancies to equality, and by furnishing from whatever is
   at hand the enjoyment sought from superfluities. For simplicity, as the
   name shows, is not conspicuous, is not inflated or puffed up in aught,
   but is altogether even, and gentle, and equal, and free of excess, and
   so is sufficient. And sufficiency is a condition which reaches its
   proper end without excess or defect. The mother of these is Justice,
   and their nurse "Independence;" and this is a condition which is
   satisfied with what is necessary, and by itself furnishes what
   contributes to the blessed life.

   Let there, then, be in the fruits of thy hands, sacred order, liberal
   communication, and acts of economy. "For he that giveth to the poor,
   lendeth to God." [1569] "And the hands of the manly shall be enriched."
   [1570] Manly He calls those who despise wealth, and are free in
   bestowing it. And on your feet [1571] let active readiness to
   well-doing appear, and a journeying to righteousness. Modesty and
   chastity are collars and necklaces; such are the chains which God
   forges. "Happy is the man who hath found wisdom, and the mortal who
   knows understanding," says the Spirit by Solomon: "for it is better to
   buy her than treasures of gold and silver; and she is more valuable
   than precious stones." [1572] For she is the true decoration.

   And let not their ears be pierced, contrary to nature, in order to
   attach to them ear-rings and ear-drops. For it is not right to force
   nature against her wishes. Nor could there be any better ornament for
   the ears than true instruction, which finds its way naturally into the
   passages of hearing. And eyes anointed by the Word, and ears pierced
   for perception, make a man a hearer and contemplator of divine and
   sacred things, the Word truly exhibiting the true beauty "which eye
   hath not seen nor ear heard before." [1573]

      Chapter I.--On the True Beauty.

   It is then, as appears, the greatest of all lessons to know one's self.
   For if one knows himself, he will know God; and knowing God, he will be
   made like God, not by wearing gold or long robes, but by well-doing,
   and by requiring as few things as possible. [1574]

   Now, God alone is in need of nothing, and rejoices most when He sees us
   bright with the ornament of intelligence; and then, too, rejoices in
   him who is arrayed in chastity, the sacred stole of the body. Since
   then the soul consists of three divisions; [1575] the intellect, which
   is called the reasoning faculty, is the inner man, which is the ruler
   of this man that is seen. And that one, in another respect, God guides.
   But the irascible part, being brutal, dwells near to insanity. And
   appetite, which is the third department, is many-shaped above Proteus,
   the varying sea-god, who changed himself now into one shape, now into
   another; and it allures to adulteries, to licentiousness, to
   seductions.


   "At first he was a lion with ample beard." [1576]

   While he yet retained the ornament, the hair of the chin showed him to
   be a man.


   "But after that a serpent, a pard, or a big sow."

   Love of ornament has degenerated to wantonness. A man no longer appears
   like a strong wild beast,


   "But he became moist water, and a tree of lofty branches."

   Passions break out, pleasures overflow; beauty fades, and falls quicker
   than the leaf on the ground, when the amorous storms of lust blow on it
   before the coming of autumn, and is withered by destruction. For lust
   becomes and fabricates all things, and wishes to cheat, so as to
   conceal the man. But that man with whom the Word dwells does not alter
   himself, does not get himself up: he has the form which is of the Word;
   he is made like to God; he is beautiful; he does not ornament himself:
   his is beauty, the true beauty, for it is God; and that man becomes
   God, since God so wills. Heraclitus, then, rightly said, "Men are gods,
   and gods are men." For the Word Himself is the manifest mystery: God in
   man, and man God. And the Mediator executes the Father's will; for the
   Mediator is the Word, who is common to both--the Son of God, the
   Saviour of men; His Servant, our Teacher. And the flesh being a slave,
   as Paul testifies, how can one with any reason adorn the handmaid like
   a pimp? For that which is of flesh has the form of a servant. Paul
   says, speaking of the Lord, "Because He emptied Himself, taking the
   form of a servant," [1577] calling the outward man servant, previous to
   the Lord becoming a servant and wearing flesh. But the compassionate
   God Himself set the flesh free, and releasing it from destruction, and
   from bitter and deadly bondage, endowed it with incorruptibility,
   arraying the flesh in this, the holy embellishment of
   eternity--immortality.

   There is, too, another beauty of men--love. "And love," according to
   the apostle, "suffers long, and is kind; envieth not; vaunteth not
   itself, is not puffed up." [1578] For the decking of one's self
   out--carrying, as it does, the look of superfluity and uselessness--is
   vaunting one's self. Wherefore he adds, "doth not behave itself
   unseemly:" for a figure which is not one's own, and is against nature,
   is unseemly; but what is artificial is not one's own, as is clearly
   explained: "seeketh not," it is said, "what is not her own." For truth
   calls that its own which belongs to it; but the love of finery seeks
   what is not its own, being apart from God, and the Word, from love.

   And that the Lord Himself was uncomely in aspect, the Spirit testifies
   by Esaias: "And we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness but His
   form was mean, inferior to men." [1579] Yet who was more admirable than
   the Lord? But it was not the beauty of the flesh visible to the eye,
   but the true beauty of both soul and body, which He exhibited, which in
   the former is beneficence; in the latter--that is, the
   flesh--immortality.

      Chapter II.--Against Embellishing the Body.

   It is not, then, the aspect of the outward man, but the soul that is to
   be decorated with the ornament of goodness; we may say also the flesh
   with the adornment of temperance. But those women who beautify the
   outside, are unawares all waste in the inner depths, as is the case
   with the ornaments of the Egyptians; among whom temples with their
   porticos and vestibules are carefully constructed, and groves and
   sacred fields adjoining; the halls are surrounded with many pillars;
   and the walls gleam with foreign stones, and there is no want of
   artistic painting; and the temples gleam with gold, and silver, and
   amber, and glitter with parti-coloured gems from India and Ethiopia;
   and the shrines are veiled with gold-embroidered hangings.

   But if you enter the penetralia of the enclosure, and, in haste to
   behold something better, seek the image that is the inhabitant of the
   temple, and if any priest of those that offer sacrifice there, looking
   grave, and singing a pæan in the Egyptian tongue, remove a little of
   the veil to show the god, he will give you a hearty laugh at the object
   of worship. For the deity that is sought, to whom you have rushed, will
   not be found within, but a cat, or a crocodile, or a serpent of the
   country, or some such beast unworthy of the temple, but quite worthy of
   a den, a hole, or the dirt. The god of the Egyptians appears a beast
   rolling on a purple couch.

   So those women who wear gold, occupying themselves in curling at their
   locks, and engaged in anointing their cheeks, painting their eyes, and
   dyeing their hair, and practising the other pernicious arts of luxury,
   decking the covering of flesh,--in truth, imitate the Egyptians, in
   order to attract their infatuated lovers.

   But if one withdraw the veil of the temple, I mean the head-dress, the
   dye, the clothes, the gold, the paint, the cosmetics,--that is, the web
   consisting of them, the veil, with the view of finding within the true
   beauty, he will be disgusted, I know well. For he will not find the
   image of God dwelling within, as is meet; but instead of it a
   fornicator and adulteress has occupied the shrine of the soul. And the
   true beast will thus be detected--an ape smeared with white paint. And
   that deceitful serpent, devouring the understanding part of man through
   vanity, has the soul as its hole, filling all with deadly poisons; and
   injecting his own venom of deception, this pander of a dragon has
   changed women into harlots. For love of display is not for a lady, but
   a courtesan. Such women care little for keeping at home with their
   husbands; but loosing their husbands' purse-strings, they spend its
   supplies on their lusts, that they may have many witnesses of their
   seemingly fair appearance; and, devoting the whole day to their toilet,
   they spend their time with their bought slaves. Accordingly they season
   the flesh like a pernicious sauce; and the day they bestow on the
   toilet shut up in their rooms, so as not to be caught decking
   themselves. But in the evening this spurious beauty creeps out to
   candle-light as out of a hole; for drunkenness and the dimness of the
   light aid what they have put on. The woman who dyes her hair yellow,
   Menander the comic poet expels from the house:--


   "Now get out of this house, for no chaste

   Woman ought to make her hair yellow,"

   nor, I would add, stain her cheeks, nor paint her eyes. Unawares the
   poor wretches destroy their own beauty, by the introduction of what is
   spurious. At the dawn of day, mangling, racking, and plastering
   themselves over with certain compositions, they chill the skin, furrow
   the flesh with poisons, and with curiously prepared washes, thus
   blighting their own beauty. Wherefore they are seen to be yellow from
   the use of cosmetics, and susceptible to disease, their flesh, which
   has been shaded with poisons, being now in a melting state. So they
   dishonour the Creator of men, as if the beauty given by Him were
   nothing worth. As you might expect, they become lazy in housekeeping,
   sitting like painted things to be looked at, not as if made for
   domestic economy. Wherefore in the comic poet the sensible woman says,
   "What can we women do wise or brilliant, who sit with hair dyed yellow,
   outraging the character of gentlewomen; causing the overthrow of
   houses, the ruin of nuptials, and accusations on the part of children?"
   [1580] In the same way, Antiphanes the comic poet, in Malthaca,
   ridicules the meretriciousness of women in words that apply to them
   all, and are framed against the rubbing of themselves with cosmetics,
   saying:--


   "She comes,

   She goes back, she approaches, she goes back.

   She has come, she is here, she washes herself, she advances,

   She is soaped, she is combed, she goes out, is rubbed,

   She washes herself, looks in the glass, robes herself,

   Anoints herself, decks herself, besmears herself;

   And if aught is wrong, chokes [with vexation]."

   Thrice, I say, not once, do they deserve to perish, who use crocodiles'
   excrement, and anoint themselves with the froth of putrid humours, and
   stain their eyebrows with soot, and rub their cheeks with white lead.

   These, then, who are disgusting even to the heathen poets for their
   fashions, how shall they not be rejected by the truth? [1581]
   Accordingly another comic poet, Alexis, reproves them. For I shall
   adduce his words, which with extravagance of statement shame the
   obstinacy of their impudence. For he was not very far beyond the mark.
   And I cannot for shame come to the assistance of women held up to such
   ridicule in comedy.

   Then she ruins her husband.


   "For first, in comparison with gain and the spoiling of neighbours,

   All else is in their eyes superfluous."

   "Is one of them little? She stitches cork into her shoe-sole.

   Is one tall? She wears a thin sole,

   And goes out keeping her head down on her shoulder:

   This takes away from her height. Has one no flanks?

   She has something sewed on to her, so that the spectators

   May exclaim on her fine shape behind. Has she a prominent stomach?

   By making additions, to render it straight, such as the nurses we see
   in the comic poets,

   She draws back, as it were, by these poles, the protuberance of the
   stomach in front.

   Has one yellow eyebrows? She stains them with soot.

   Do they happen to be black? She smears them with ceruse.

   Is one very white-skinned? She rouges.

   Has one any part of the body beautiful? She shows it bare.

   Has she beautiful teeth? She must needs laugh,

   That those present may see what a pretty mouth she has;

   But if not in the humour for laughing, she passes the day within,

   With a slender sprig of myrtle between her lips,

   Like what cooks have always at hand when they have goats' heads to
   sell,

   So that she must keep them apart the whilst, whether she will or not."

   I set these quotations from the comic poets [1582] before you, since
   the Word most strenuously wishes to save us. And by and by I will
   fortify them with the divine Scriptures. For he who does not escape
   notice is wont to abstain from sins, on account of the shame of
   reproof. Just as the plastered hand and the anointed eye exhibit from
   their very look the suspicion of a person in illness, so also cosmetics
   and dyes indicate that the soul is deeply diseased.

   The divine Instructor enjoins us not to approach to another's river,
   meaning by the figurative expression "another's river," "another's
   wife;" the wanton that flows to all, and out of licentiousness gives
   herself up to meretricious enjoyment with all. "Abstain from water that
   is another's," He says, "and drink not of another's well," admonishing
   us to shun the stream of "voluptuousness," that we may live long, and
   that years of life may be added to us; [1583] both by not hunting after
   pleasure that belongs to another, and by diverting our inclinations.

   Love of dainties and love of wine, though great vices, are not of such
   magnitude as fondness for finery. [1584] "A full table and repeated
   cups" are enough to satisfy greed. But to those who are fond of gold,
   and purple, and jewels, neither the gold that is above the earth and
   below it is sufficient, nor the Tyrian Sea, nor the freight that comes
   from India and Ethiopia, nor yet Pactolus flowing with gold; not even
   were a man to become a Midas would he be satisfied, but would be still
   poor, craving other wealth. Such people are ready to die with their
   gold.

   And if Plutus [1585] is blind, are not those women that are crazy about
   him, and have a fellow-feeling with him, blind too? Having, then, no
   limit to their lust, they push on to shamelessness. For the theatre,
   and pageants, and many spectators, and strolling in the temples, and
   loitering in the streets, that they may be seen conspicuously by all,
   are necessary to them. For those that glory in their looks, not in
   heart, [1586] dress to please others. For as the brand shows the slave,
   so do gaudy colours the adulteress. "For though thou clothe thyself in
   scarlet, and deck thyself with ornaments of gold, and anoint thine eyes
   with stibium, in vain is thy beauty," [1587] says the Word by Jeremiah.
   Is it not monstrous, that while horses, birds, and the rest of the
   animals, spring and bound from the grass and meadows, rejoicing in
   ornament that is their own, in mane, and natural colour, and varied
   plumage; woman, as if inferior to the brute creation, should think
   herself so unlovely as to need foreign, and bought, and painted beauty?

   Head-dresses and varieties of head-dresses, and elaborate braidings,
   and infinite modes of dressing the hair, and costly specimens of
   mirrors, in which they arrange their costume,--hunting after those
   that, like silly children, are crazy about their figures,--are
   characteristic of women who have lost all sense of shame. If any one
   were to call these courtesans, he would make no mistake, for they turn
   their faces into masks. But us the Word enjoins "to look not on the
   things that are seen, but the things that are not seen; for the things
   that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are
   eternal." [1588]

   But what passes beyond the bounds of absurdity, is that they have
   invented mirrors for this artificial shape of theirs, as if it were
   some excellent work or masterpiece. The deception rather requires a
   veil thrown over it. For as the Greek fable has it, it was not a
   fortunate thing for the beautiful Narcissus to have been the beholder
   of his own image. And if Moses commanded men to make not an image to
   represent God by art, how can these women be right, who by their own
   reflection produce an imitation of their own likeness, in order to the
   falsifying of their faces? Likewise also, when Samuel the prophet was
   sent to anoint one of the sons of Jesse for king, and on seeing the
   eldest of his sons to be fair and tall, produced the anointing oil,
   being delighted with him, the Lord said to him, "Look not to his
   appearance, nor the height of his stature: for I have rejected him. For
   man looketh on the eyes, but the Lord into the heart." [1589]

   And he anointed not him that was comely in person, but him that was
   comely in soul. If, then, the Lord counts the natural beauty of the
   body inferior to that of the soul, what thinks He of spurious beauty,
   rejecting utterly as He does all falsehood? "For we walk by faith, not
   by sight." [1590] Very clearly the Lord accordingly teaches by Abraham,
   that he who follows God must despise country, and relations, and
   possessions, and all wealth, by making him a stranger. And therefore
   also He called him His friend who had despised the substance which he
   had possessed at home. For he was of good parentage, and very opulent;
   and so with three hundred and eighteen servants of his own he subdued
   the four kings who had taken Lot captive.

   Esther alone we find justly adorned. The spouse adorned herself
   mystically for her royal husband; but her beauty turns out the
   redemption price of a people that were about to be massacred. And that
   decoration makes women courtesans, and men effeminate and adulterers,
   the tragic poet is a witness; thus discoursing:--


   "He that judged the goddesses,

   As the myth of the Argives has it, having come from Phrygia

   To Lacedæmon, arrayed in flowery vestments,

   Glittering with gold and barbaric luxury,

   Loving, departed, carrying away her he loved,

   Helen, to the folds of Ida, having found that

   Menelaus was away from home." [1591]

   O adulterous beauty! Barbarian finery and effeminate luxury overthrew
   Greece; Lacedæmonian chastity was corrupted by clothes, and luxury, and
   graceful beauty; barbaric display proved Jove's daughter a courtesan.

   They had no instructor [1592] to restrain their lusts, nor one to say,
   "Do not commit adultery;" nor, "Lust not;" or, "Travel not by lust into
   adultery;" or further, "Influence not thy passions by desire of
   adornment."

   What an end was it that ensued to them, and what woes they endured, who
   would not restrain their self-will! Two continents were convulsed by
   unrestrained pleasures, and all was thrown into confusion by a
   barbarian boy. The whole of Hellas puts to sea; the ocean is burdened
   with the weight of continents; a protracted war breaks out, and fierce
   battles are waged, and the plains are crowded with dead: the barbarian
   assails the fleet with outrage; wickedness prevails, and the eye of
   that poetic Jove looks on the Thracians:--


   "The barbarian plains drink noble blood,

   And the streams of the rivers are choked with dead bodies."

   Breasts are beaten in lamentations, and grief desolates the land; and
   all the feet, and the summits of many-fountained Ida, and the cities of
   the Trojans, and the ships of the Achæans, shake.

   Where, O Homer, shall we flee and stand? Show us a spot of ground that
   is not shaken!--


   "Touch not the reins, inexperienced boy,

   Nor mount the seat, not having learned to drive." [1593]

   Heaven delights in two charioteers, by whom alone the chariot of fire
   is guided. For the mind is carried away by pleasure; and the unsullied
   principle of reason, when not instructed by the Word, slides down into
   licentiousness, and gets a fall as the due reward of its transgression.
   An example of this are the angels, who renounced the beauty of God for
   a beauty which fades, and so fell from heaven to earth. [1594]

   The Shechemites, too, were punished by an overthrow for dishonouring
   the holy virgin. The grave was their punishment, and the monument of
   their ignominy leads to salvation.

      Chapter III.--Against Men Who Embellish Themselves.

   To such an extent, then, has luxury advanced, that not only are the
   female sex deranged about this frivolous pursuit, but men also are
   infected with the disease. [1595] For not being free of the love of
   finery, they are not in health; but inclining to voluptuousness, they
   become effeminate, cutting their hair in an ungentlemanlike and
   meretricious way, clothed in fine and transparent garments, chewing
   mastich, [1596] smelling of perfume. [1597] What can one say on seeing
   them? Like one who judges people by their foreheads, he will divine
   them to be adulterers and effeminate, addicted to both kinds of venery,
   haters of hair, destitute of hair, detesting the bloom of manliness,
   and adorning their locks like women. "Living for unholy acts of
   audacity, these fickle wretches do reckless and nefarious deeds," says
   the Sibyl. For their service the towns are full of those who take out
   hair by pitch-plasters, shave, and pluck out hairs from these womanish
   creatures. And shops are erected and opened everywhere; and adepts at
   this meretricious fornication make a deal of money openly by those who
   plaster themselves, and give their hair to be pulled out in all ways by
   those who make it their trade, feeling no shame before the onlookers or
   those who approach, nor before themselves, being men. Such are those
   addicted to base passions, whose whole body is made smooth by the
   violent tuggings of pitch-plasters. It is utterly impossible to get
   beyond such effrontery. If nothing is left undone by them, neither
   shall anything be left unspoken by me. Diogenes, when he was being
   sold, chiding like a teacher one of these degenerate creatures, said
   very manfully, "Come, youngster, buy for yourself a man," chastising
   his meretriciousness by an ambiguous speech. But for those who are men
   to shave and smooth themselves, how ignoble! As for dyeing of hair, and
   anointing of grey locks, and dyeing them yellow, these are practices of
   abandoned effeminates; and their feminine combing of themselves is a
   thing to be let alone. For they think, that like serpents they divest
   themselves of the old age of their head by painting and renovating
   themselves. But though they do doctor the hair cleverly, they will not
   escape wrinkles, nor will they elude death by tricking time. For it is
   not dreadful, it is not dreadful to appear old, when you are not able
   to shut your eyes to the fact that you are so.

   The more, then, a man hastes to the end, the more truly venerable is
   he, having God alone as his senior, since He is the eternal aged One,
   He who is older than all things. Prophecy has called him the "Ancient
   of days; and the hair of His head was as pure wool," says the prophet.
   [1598] "And none other," says the Lord, "can make the hair white or
   black." [1599] How, then, do these godless ones work in rivalry with
   God, or rather violently oppose Him, when they transmute the hair made
   white by Him? "The crown of old men is great experience," [1600] says
   Scripture; and the hoary hair of their countenance is the blossom of
   large experience. But these dishonour the reverence of age, the head
   covered with grey hairs. It is not, it is not possible for him to show
   the head true who has a fraudulent head. "But ye have not so learned
   Christ; if so be that ye have heard Him, and have been taught by Him,
   as the truth is in Jesus: that ye put off, concerning the former
   conversation, the old man (not the hoary man, but him that is) corrupt
   according to deceitful lusts; and be renewed (not by dyeings and
   ornaments), but in the spirit of your mind; and put on the new man,
   which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness." [1601]

   But for one who is a man to comb himself and shave himself with a
   razor, for the sake of fine effect, to arrange his hair at the
   looking-glass, to shave his cheeks, pluck hairs out of them, and smooth
   them, how womanly! And, in truth, unless you saw them naked, you would
   suppose them to be women. For although not allowed to wear gold, yet
   out of effeminate desire they enwreath their latches and fringes with
   leaves of gold; or, getting certain spherical figures of the same metal
   made, they fasten them to their ankles, and hang them from their necks.
   This is a device of enervated men, who are dragged to the women's
   apartments, amphibious and lecherous beasts. For this is a meretricious
   and impious form of snare. For God wished women to be smooth, and
   rejoice in their locks alone growing spontaneously, as a horse in his
   mane; but has adorned man, like the lions, with a beard, and endowed
   him, as an attribute of manhood, with shaggy breasts,--a sign this of
   strength and rule. So also cocks, which fight in defence of the hens,
   he has decked with combs, as it were helmets; and so high a value does
   God set on these locks, that He orders them to make their appearance on
   men simultaneously with discretion, and delighted with a venerable
   look, has honoured gravity of countenance with grey hairs. But wisdom,
   and discriminating judgments that are hoary with wisdom, attain
   maturity with time, and by the vigour of long experience give strength
   to old age, producing grey hairs, the admirable flower of venerable
   wisdom, conciliating confidence. This, then, the mark of the man, the
   beard, by which he is seen to be a man, is older than Eve, and is the
   token of the superior nature. In this God deemed it right that he
   should excel, and dispersed hair over man's whole body. Whatever
   smoothness and softness was in him He abstracted from his side when He
   formed the woman Eve, physically receptive, his partner in parentage,
   his help in household management, while he (for he had parted with all
   smoothness) remained a man, and shows himself man. And to him has been
   assigned action, as to her suffering; for what is shaggy is drier and
   warmer than what is smooth. Wherefore males have both more hair and
   more heat than females, animals that are entire than the emasculated,
   perfect than imperfect. It is therefore impious to desecrate the symbol
   of manhood, hairiness. [1602] But the embellishment of smoothing (for I
   am warned by the Word), if it is to attract men, is the act of an
   effeminate person,--if to attract women, is the act of an adulterer;
   and both must be driven as far as possible from our society. "But the
   very hairs of your head are all numbered," says the Lord; [1603] those
   on the chin, too, are numbered, and those on the whole body. There must
   be therefore no plucking out, contrary to God's appointment, which has
   counted [1604] them in according to His will. "Know ye not yourselves,"
   says the apostle, "that Christ Jesus is in you?" [1605] Whom, had we
   known as dwelling in us, I know not how we could have dared to
   dishonour. But the using of pitch to pluck out hair (I shrink from even
   mentioning the shamelessness connected with this process), and in the
   act of bending back and bending down, the violence done to nature's
   modesty by stepping out and bending backwards in shameful postures, yet
   the doers not ashamed of themselves, but conducting themselves without
   shame in the midst of the youth, and in the gymnasium, where the
   prowess of man is tried; the following of this unnatural practice, is
   it not the extreme of licentiousness? For those who engage in such
   practices in public will scarcely behave with modesty to any at home.
   Their want of shame in public attests their unbridled licentiousness in
   private. [1606] For he who in the light of day denies his manhood, will
   prove himself manifestly a woman by night. "There shall not be," said
   the Word by Moses, "a harlot of the daughters of Israel; there shall
   not be a fornicator of the sons of Israel." [1607]

   But the pitch does good, it is said. Nay, it defames, say I. No one who
   entertains right sentiments would wish to appear a fornicator, were he
   not the victim of that vice, and study to defame the beauty of his
   form. No one would, I say, voluntarily choose to do this. "For if God
   foreknew those who are called, according to His purpose, to be
   conformed to the image of His Son," for whose sake, according to the
   blessed apostle, He has appointed "Him to be the first-born among many
   brethren," [1608] are they not godless who treat with indignity the
   body which is of like form with the Lord?

   The man, who would be beautiful, must adorn that which is the most
   beautiful thing in man, his mind, which every day he ought to exhibit
   in greater comeliness; and should pluck out not hairs, but lusts. I
   pity the boys possessed by the slave-dealers, that are decked for
   dishonour. But they are not treated with ignominy by themselves, but by
   command the wretches are adorned for base gain. But how disgusting are
   those who willingly practice the things to which, if compelled, they
   would, if they were men, die rather than do?

   But life has reached this pitch of licentiousness through the
   wantonness of wickedness, and lasciviousness is diffused over the
   cities, having become law. Beside them women stand in the stews,
   offering their own flesh for hire for lewd pleasure, and boys, taught
   to deny their sex, act the part of women.

   Luxury has deranged all things; it has disgraced man. A luxurious
   niceness seeks everything, attempts everything, forces everything,
   coerces nature. Men play the part of women, and women that of men,
   contrary to nature; women are at once wives and husbands: no passage is
   closed against libidinousness; and their promiscuous lechery is a
   public institution, and luxury is domesticated. O miserable spectacle!
   horrible conduct! Such are the trophies of your social licentiousness
   which are exhibited: the evidence of these deeds are the prostitutes.
   Alas for such wickedness! Besides, the wretches know not how many
   tragedies the uncertainty of intercourse produces. For fathers,
   unmindful of children of theirs that have been exposed, often without
   their knowledge, have intercourse with a son that has debauched
   himself, and daughters that are prostitutes; and licence in lust shows
   them to be the men that have begotten them. These things your wise laws
   allow: people may sin legally; and the execrable indulgence in pleasure
   they call a thing indifferent. They who commit adultery against nature
   think themselves free from adultery. Avenging justice follows their
   audacious deeds, and, dragging on themselves inevitable calamity, they
   purchase death for a small sum of money. The miserable dealers in these
   wares sail, bringing a cargo of fornication, like wine or oil; and
   others, far more wretched, traffic in pleasures as they do in bread and
   sauce, not heeding the words of Moses, "Do not prostitute thy daughter,
   to cause her to be a whore, lest the land fall to whoredom, and the
   land become full of wickedness." [1609]

   Such was predicted of old, and the result is notorious: the whole earth
   has now become full of fornication and wickedness. I admire the ancient
   legislators of the Romans: these detested effeminacy of conduct; and
   the giving of the body to feminine purposes, contrary to the law of
   nature, they judged worthy of the extremest penalty, according to the
   righteousness of the law.

   For it is not lawful to pluck out the beard, [1610] man's natural and
   noble ornament.


   "A youth with his first beard: for with this, youth is most graceful."

   By and by he is anointed, delighting in the beard "on which descended"
   the prophetic "ointment" [1611] with which Aaron was honoured.

   And it becomes him who is rightly trained, on whom peace has pitched
   its tent, to preserve peace also with his hair.

   What, then, will not women with strong propensities to lust practice,
   when they look on men perpetrating such enormities? Rather we ought not
   to call such as these men, but lewd wretches (bataloi), and effeminate
   (gunides), whose voices are feeble, and whose clothes are womanish both
   in feel and dye. And such creatures are manifestly shown to be what
   they are from their external appearance, their clothes, shoes, form,
   walk, cut of their hair, look. "For from his look shall a man be
   known," says the Scripture, "from meeting a man the man is known: the
   dress of a man, the step of his foot, the laugh of his teeth, tell
   tales of him." [1612]

   For these, for the most part, plucking out the rest of their hair, only
   dress that on the head, all but binding their locks with fillets like
   women. Lions glory in their shaggy hair, but are armed by their hair in
   the fight; and boars even are made imposing by their mane; the hunters
   are afraid of them when they see them bristling their hair.


   "The fleecy sheep are loaded with their wool." [1613]

   And their wool the loving Father has made abundant for thy use, O man,
   having taught thee to sheer their fleeces. Of the nations, the Celts
   and Scythians wear their hair long, but do not deck themselves. The
   bushy hair of the barbarian has something fearful in it; and its auburn
   (xanthon) colour threatens war, the hue being somewhat akin to blood.
   Both these barbarian races hate luxury. As clear witnesses will be
   produced by the German, the Rhine; [1614] and by the Scythian, the
   waggon. Sometimes the Scythian despises even the waggon: its size seems
   sumptuousness to the barbarian; and leaving its luxurious ease, the
   Scythian man leads a frugal life. For a house sufficient, and less
   encumbered than the waggon, he takes his horse, and mounting it, is
   borne where he wishes. And when faint with hunger, he asks his horse
   for sustenance; and he offers his veins, and supplies his master with
   all he possesses--his blood. To the nomad the horse is at once
   conveyance and sustenance; and the warlike youth of the Arabians (these
   are other nomads) are mounted on camels. They sit on breeding camels;
   and these feed and run at the same time, carrying their masters the
   whilst, and bear the house with them. And if drink fail the barbarians,
   they milk them; and after that their food is spent, they do not spare
   even their blood, as is reported of furious wolves. And these, gentler
   than the barbarians, when injured, bear no remembrance of the wrong,
   but sweep bravely over the desert, carrying and nourishing their
   masters at the same time.

   Perish, then, the savage beasts whose food is blood! For it is unlawful
   for men, whose body is nothing but flesh elaborated of blood, to touch
   blood. For human blood has become a partaker of the Word: [1615] it is
   a participant of grace by the Spirit; and if any one injure him, he
   will not escape unnoticed. Man may, though naked in body, address the
   Lord. But I approve the simplicity of the barbarians: loving an
   unencumbered life, the barbarians have abandoned luxury. Such the Lord
   calls us to be--naked of finery, naked of vanity, wrenched from our
   sins, bearing only the wood of life, aiming only at salvation.

      Chapter IV.--With Whom We are to Associate.

   But really I have unwittingly deviated in spirit from the order, to
   which I must now revert, and must find fault with having large numbers
   of domestics. For, avoiding working with their own hands and serving
   themselves, men have recourse to servants, purchasing a great crowd of
   fine cooks, and of people to lay out the table, and of others to divide
   the meat skilfully into pieces. And the staff of servants is separated
   into many divisions; some labour for their gluttony, carvers and
   seasoners, and the compounders and makers of sweetmeats, and
   honey-cakes, and custards; others are occupied with their too numerous
   clothes; others guard the gold, like griffins; others keep the silver,
   and wipe the cups, and make ready what is needed to furnish the festive
   table; others rub down the horses; and a crowd of cup-bearers exert
   themselves in their service, and herds of beautiful boys, like cattle,
   from whom they milk away their beauty. And male and female assistants
   at the toilet are employed about the ladies--some for the mirrors, some
   for the head-dresses, others for the combs. Many are eunuchs; and these
   panders serve without suspicion those that wish to be free to enjoy
   their pleasures, because of the belief that they are unable to indulge
   in lust. But a true eunuch is not one who is unable, but one who is
   unwilling, to indulge in pleasure. The Word, testifying by the prophet
   Samuel to the Jews, who had transgressed when the people asked for a
   king, promised not a loving lord, but threatened to give them a
   self-willed and voluptuous tyrant, "who shall," He says, "take your
   daughters to be perfumers, and cooks, and bakers," [1616] ruling by the
   law of war, not desiring a peaceful administration. And there are many
   Celts, who bear aloft on their shoulders women's litters. But workers
   in wool, and spinners, and weavers, and female work and housekeeping,
   are nowhere.

   But those who impose on the women, spend the day with them, telling
   them silly amatory stories, and wearing out body and soul with their
   false acts and words. "Thou shalt not be with many," it is said, "for
   evil, nor give thyself to a multitude;" [1617] for wisdom shows itself
   among few, but disorder in a multitude. But it is not for grounds of
   propriety, on account of not wishing to be seen, that they purchase
   bearers, for it were commendable if out of such feelings they put
   themselves under a covering; but it is out of luxuriousness that they
   are carried on their domestics' shoulders, and desire to make a show.

   So, opening the curtain, and looking keenly round on all that direct
   their eyes towards them, they show their manners; and often bending
   forth from within, disgrace this superficial propriety by their
   dangerous restlessness. "Look not round," it is said, "in the streets
   of the city, and wander not in its lonely places." [1618] For that is,
   in truth, a lonely place, though there be a crowd of the licentious in
   it, where no wise man is present.

   And these women are carried about over the temples, sacrificing and
   practising divination day by day, spending their time with
   fortune-tellers, and begging priests, and disreputable old women; and
   they keep up old wives' whisperings over their cups, learning charms
   and incantations from soothsayers, to the ruin of the nuptial bonds.
   And some men they keep; by others they are kept; and others are
   promised them by the diviners. They know not that they are cheating
   themselves, and giving up themselves as a vessel of pleasure to those
   that wish to indulge in wantonness; and exchanging their purity for the
   foulest outrage, they think what is the most shameful ruin a great
   stroke of business. And there are many ministers to this meretricious
   licentiousness, insinuating themselves, one from one quarter, another
   from another. For the licentious rush readily into uncleanness, like
   swine rushing to that part of the hold of the ship which is depressed.
   Whence the Scripture most strenuously exhorts, "Introduce not every one
   into thy house, for the snares of the crafty are many." [1619] And in
   another place, "Let just men be thy guests, and in the fear of the Lord
   let thy boast remain." [1620] Away with fornication. "For know this
   well," says the apostle, "that no fornicator, or unclean person, or
   covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom
   of Christ and of God." [1621]

   But these women delight in intercourse with the effeminate. And crowds
   of abominable creatures (kinaides) flow in, of unbridled tongue, filthy
   in body, filthy in language; men enough for lewd offices, ministers of
   adultery, giggling and whispering, and shamelessly making through their
   noses sounds of lewdness and fornication to provoke lust, endeavouring
   to please by lewd words and attitudes, inciting to laughter, the
   precursor of fornication. And sometimes, when inflamed by any
   provocation, either these fornicators, or those that follow the rabble
   of abominable creatures to destruction, make a sound in their nose like
   a frog, as if they had got anger dwelling in their nostrils. But those
   who are more refined than these keep Indian birds and Median pea-fowls,
   and recline with peak-headed [1622] creatures; playing with satyrs,
   delighting in monsters. They laugh when they hear Thersites; and these
   women, purchasing Thersiteses highly valued, pride themselves not in
   their husbands, but in those wretches which are a burden on the earth,
   and overlook the chaste widow, who is of far higher value than a
   Melitæan pup, and look askance at a just old man, who is lovelier in my
   estimation than a monster purchased for money. And though maintaining
   parrots and curlews, they do not receive the orphan child; [1623] but
   they expose children that are born at home, and take up the young of
   birds, and prefer irrational to rational creatures; although they ought
   to undertake the maintenance of old people with a character for
   sobriety, who are fairer in my mind than apes, and capable of uttering
   something better than nightingales; and to set before them that saying,
   "He that pitieth the poor lendeth to the Lord;" [1624] and this,
   "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these My brethren, ye
   have done it to Me." [1625] But these, on the other hand, prefer
   ignorance to wisdom, turning their wealth into stone, that is, into
   pearls and Indian emeralds. And they squander and throw away their
   wealth on fading dyes, and bought slaves; like crammed fowls scraping
   the dung of life. "Poverty," it is said, "humbles a man." [1626] By
   poverty is meant that niggardliness by which the rich are poor, having
   nothing to give away.

      Chapter V.--Behaviour in the Baths.

   And of what sort are their baths? Houses skilfully constructed,
   compact, portable, transparent, covered with fine linen. And
   gold-plated chairs, and silver ones, too, and ten thousand vessels of
   gold and silver, some for drinking, some for eating, some for bathing,
   are carried about with them. Besides these, there are even braziers of
   coals; for they have arrived at such a pitch of self-indulgence, that
   they sup and get drunk while bathing. And articles of silver with which
   they make a show, they ostentatiously set out in the baths, and thus
   display perchance their wealth out of excessive pride, but chiefly the
   capricious ignorance, through which they brand effeminate men, who have
   been vanquished by women; proving at least that they themselves cannot
   meet and cannot sweat without a multitude of vessels, although poor
   women who have no display equally enjoy their baths. The dirt of
   wealth, then, has an abundant covering of censure. With this, as with a
   bait, they hook the miserable creatures that gape at the glitter of
   gold. For dazzling thus those fond of display, they artfully try to win
   the admiration of their lovers, who after a little insult them naked.
   They will scarce strip before their own husbands affecting a plausible
   pretence of modesty; but any others who wish, may see them at home shut
   up naked in their baths. For there they are not ashamed to strip before
   spectators, as if exposing their persons for sale. But Hesiod advises


   "Not to wash the skin in the women's bath." [1627]

   The baths are opened promiscuously to men and women; and there they
   strip for licentious indulgence (for from looking, men get to loving),
   as if their modesty had been washed away in the bath. [1628] Those who
   have not become utterly destitute of modesty shut out strangers; but
   bathe with their own servants, and strip naked before their slaves, and
   are rubbed by them; giving to the crouching menial liberty to lust, by
   permitting fearless handling. For those who are introduced before their
   naked mistresses while in the bath, study to strip themselves in order
   to audacity in lust, casting off fear in consequence of the wicked
   custom. The ancient athletes, [1629] ashamed to exhibit a man naked,
   preserved their modesty by going through the contest in drawers; but
   these women, divesting themselves of their modesty along with their
   tunic, wish to appear beautiful, but contrary to their wish are simply
   proved to be wicked. [1630] For through the body itself the wantonness
   of lust shines clearly; as in the case of dropsical people, the water
   covered by the skin. Disease in both is known from the look. Men,
   therefore, affording to women a noble example of truth, ought to be
   ashamed at their stripping before them, and guard against these
   dangerous sights; "for he who has looked curiously," it is said, "hath
   sinned already." [1631] At home, therefore, they ought to regard with
   modesty parents and domestics; in the ways, those they meet; in the
   baths, women; in solitude, themselves; and everywhere the Word, who is
   everywhere, "and without Him was not anything." [1632] For so only
   shall one remain without falling, if he regard God as ever present with
   him.

      Chapter VI.--The Christian Alone Rich.

   Riches are then to be partaken of rationally, bestowed lovingly, not
   sordidly, or pompously; nor is the love of the beautiful to be turned
   into self-love and ostentation; lest perchance some one say to us, "His
   horse, or land, or domestic, or gold, is worth fifteen talents; but the
   man himself is dear at three coppers."

   Take away, then, directly the ornaments from women, and domestics from
   masters, and you will find masters in no respect different from bought
   slaves in step, or look, or voice, so like are they to their slaves.
   But they differ in that they are feebler than their slaves, and have a
   more sickly upbringing.

   This best of maxims, then, ought to be perpetually repeated, "That the
   good man, being temperate and just," treasures up his wealth in heaven.
   He who has sold his worldly goods, and given them to the poor, finds
   the imperishable treasure, "where is neither moth nor robber." Blessed
   truly is he, "though he be insignificant, and feeble, and obscure;" and
   he is truly rich with the greatest of all riches. "Though a man, then,
   be richer than Cinyras and Midas, and is wicked," and haughty as he who
   was luxuriously clothed in purple and fine linen, and despised Lazarus,
   "he is miserable, and lives in trouble," and shall not live. Wealth
   seems to me to be like a serpent, which will twist round the hand and
   bite; unless one knows how to lay hold of it without danger by the
   point of the tail. And riches, wriggling either in an experienced or
   inexperienced grasp, are dexterous at adhering and biting; unless one,
   despising them, use them skilfully, so as to crush the creature by the
   charm of the Word, and himself escape unscathed.

   But, as is reasonable, he alone, who possesses what is worth most,
   turns out truly rich, though not recognised as such. And it is not
   jewels, or gold, or clothing, or beauty of person, that are of high
   value, but virtue; which is the Word given by the Instructor to be put
   in practice. This is the Word, who abjures luxury, but calls self-help
   as a servant, and praises frugality, the progeny of temperance.
   "Receive," he says, "instruction, and not silver, and knowledge rather
   than tested gold; for Wisdom is better than precious stones, nor is
   anything that is valuable equal in worth to her." [1633] And again:
   "Acquire me rather than gold, and precious stones, and silver; for my
   produce is better than choice silver." [1634]

   But if we must distinguish, let it be granted that he is rich who has
   many possessions, loaded with gold like a dirty purse; but the
   righteous alone is graceful, because grace is order, observing a due
   and decorous measure in managing and distributing. "For there are those
   who sow and reap more," [1635] of whom it is written, "He hath
   dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for
   ever." [1636] So that it is not he who has and keeps, but he who gives
   away, that is rich; and it is giving away, not possession, which
   renders a man happy; and the fruit of the Spirit is generosity. It is
   in the soul, then, that riches are. Let it, then, be granted that good
   things are the property only of good men; and Christians are good. Now,
   a fool or a libertine can neither have any perception of what is good,
   nor obtain possession of it. Accordingly, good things are possessed by
   Christians alone. And nothing is richer than these good things;
   therefore these alone are rich. For righteousness is true riches; and
   the Word is more valuable than all treasure, not accruing from cattle
   and fields, but given by God--riches which cannot be taken away. The
   soul alone is its treasure. It is the best possession to its possessor,
   rendering man truly blessed. For he whose it is to desire nothing that
   is not in our power, and to obtain by asking from God what he piously
   desires, does he not possess much, nay all, having God as his
   everlasting treasure? "To him that asks," it is said, "shall be given,
   and to him that knocketh it shall be opened." [1637] If God denies
   nothing, all things belong to the godly.

      Chapter VII.--Frugality a Good Provision for the Christian.

   Delicacies spent on pleasures become a dangerous shipwreck to men; for
   this voluptuous and ignoble life of the many is alien to true love for
   the beautiful and to refined pleasures. For man is by nature an erect
   and majestic being, aspiring after the good as becomes the creature of
   the One. But the life which crawls on its belly is destitute of
   dignity, is scandalous, hateful, ridiculous. And to the divine nature
   voluptuousness is a thing most alien; for this is for a man to be like
   sparrows in feeding, and swine and goats in lechery. For to regard
   pleasure as a good thing, is the sign of utter ignorance of what is
   excellent. Love of wealth displaces a man from the right mode of life,
   and induces him to cease from feeling shame at what is shameful; if
   only, like a beast, he has power to eat all sorts of things, and to
   drink in like manner, and to satiate in every way his lewd desires. And
   so very rarely does he inherit the kingdom of God. For what end, then,
   are such dainty dishes prepared, but to fill one belly? The filthiness
   of gluttony is proved by the sewers into which our bellies discharge
   the refuse of our food. For what end do they collect so many
   cupbearers, when they might satisfy themselves with one cup? For what
   the chests of clothes? and the gold ornaments for what? Those things
   are prepared for clothes-stealers, and scoundrels, and for greedy eyes.
   "But let alms and faith not fail thee," [1638] says the Scripture.

   Look, for instance, to Elias the Thesbite, in whom we have a beautiful
   example of frugality, when he sat down beneath the thorn, and the angel
   brought him food. "It was a cake of barley and a jar of water." [1639]
   Such the Lord sent as best for him. We, then, on our journey to the
   truth, must be unencumbered. "Carry not," said the Lord, "purse, nor
   scrip, nor shoes;" [1640] that is, possess not wealth, which is only
   treasured up in a purse; fill not your own stores, as if laying up
   produce in a bag, but communicate to those who have need. Do not
   trouble yourselves about horses and servants, who, as bearing burdens
   when the rich are travelling, are allegorically called shoes.

   We must, then, cast away the multitude of vessels, silver and gold
   drinking cups, and the crowd of domestics, receiving as we have done
   from the Instructor the fair and grave attendants, Self-help and
   Simplicity. And we must walk suitably to the Word; and if there be a
   wife and children, the house is not a burden, having learned to change
   its place along with the sound-minded traveller. The wife who loves her
   husband must be furnished for travel similarly to her husband. A fair
   provision for the journey to heaven is theirs who bear frugality with
   chaste gravity. And as the foot is the measure of the shoe, so also is
   the body of what each individual possesses. But that which is
   superfluous, what they call ornaments and the furniture of the rich, is
   a burden, not an ornament to the body. He who climbs to the heavens by
   force, must carry with him the fair staff of beneficence, and attain to
   the true rest by communicating to those who are in distress. For the
   Scripture avouches, "that the true riches of the soul are a man's
   ransom," [1641] that is, if he is rich, he will be saved by
   distributing it. For as gushing wells, when pumped out, rise again to
   their former measure, [1642] so giving away, being the benignant spring
   of love, by communicating of its drink to the thirsty, again increases
   and is replenished, just as the milk is wont to flow into the breasts
   that are sucked or milked. For he who has the almighty God, the Word,
   is in want of nothing, and never is in straits for what he needs. For
   the Word is a possession that wants nothing, and is the cause of all
   abundance. If one say that he has often seen the righteous man in need
   of food, this is rare, and happens only where there is not another
   righteous man. [1643] Notwithstanding let him read what follows: "For
   the righteous man shall not live by bread alone, but by the word of the
   Lord," [1644] who is the true bread, the bread of the heavens. The good
   man, then, can never be in difficulties so long as he keeps intact his
   confession towards God. For it appertains to him to ask and to receive
   whatever he requires from the Father of all; and to enjoy what is his
   own, if he keep the Son. And this also appertains to him, to feel no
   want.

   This Word, who trains us, confers on us the true riches. Nor is the
   growing rich an object of envy to those who possess through Him the
   privilege of wanting nothing. He that has this wealth shall inherit the
   kingdom of God.

      Chapter VIII.--Similitudes and Examples a Most Important Part of Right
      Instruction.

   And if any one of you shall entirely avoid luxury, he will, by a frugal
   upbringing, train himself to the endurance of involuntary labours, by
   employing constantly voluntary afflictions as training exercises for
   persecutions; so that when he comes to compulsory labours, and fears,
   and griefs, he will not be unpracticed in endurance.

   Wherefore we have no country on earth, that we may despise earthly
   possessions. And frugality [1645] is in the highest degree rich, being
   equal to unfailing expenditure, bestowed on what is requisite, and to
   the degree requisite. For tele has the meaning of expenses.

   How a husband is to live with his wife, and respecting self-help, and
   housekeeping, and the employment of domestics; and further, with
   respect to the time of marriage, and what is suitable for wives, we
   have treated in the discourse concerning marriage. What pertains to
   discipline alone is reserved now for description, as we delineate the
   life of Christians. The most indeed has been already said, and laid
   down in the form of disciplinary rules. What still remains we shall
   subjoin; for examples are of no small moment in determining to
   salvation. [1646]

   See, says the tragedy,


   "The consort of Ulysses was not killed

   By Telemachus; for she did not take a husband in addition to a husband,

   But in the house the marriage-bed remains unpolluted." [1647]

   Reproaching foul adultery, he showed the fair image of chastity in
   affection to her husband.

   The Lacedæmonians compelling the Helots, their servants (Helots is the
   name of their servants), to get drunk, exhibited their drunken pranks
   before themselves, who were temperate, for cure and correction.

   Observing, accordingly, their unseemly behaviour, in order that they
   themselves might not fall into like censurable conduct, they trained
   themselves, turning the reproach of the drunkards to the advantage of
   keeping themselves free from fault.

   For some men being instructed are saved; and others, self-taught,
   either aspire after or seek virtue.


   "He truly is the best of all who himself perceives all things." [1648]

   Such is Abraham, who sought God.


   "And good, again, is he who obeys him who advises well." [1649]

   Such are those disciples who obeyed the Word. Wherefore the former was
   called "friend," the latter "apostles;" the one diligently seeking, and
   the other preaching one and the same God. And both are peoples, and
   both these have hearers, the one who is profited through seeking, the
   other who is saved through finding.


   "But whoever neither himself perceives, nor, hearing another,

   Lays to heart--he is a worthless man." [1650]

   The other people is the Gentile--useless; this is the people that
   followeth not Christ. Nevertheless the Instructor, lover of man,
   helping in many ways, partly exhorts, partly upbraids. Others having
   sinned, He shows us their baseness, and exhibits the punishment
   consequent upon it, alluring while admonishing, planning to dissuade us
   in love from evil, by the exhibition of those who have suffered from it
   before. By which examples He very manifestly checked those who had been
   evil-disposed, and hindered those who were daring like deeds; and
   others He brought to a foundation of patience; others He stopped from
   wickedness; and others He cured by the contemplation of what is like,
   bringing them over to what is better.

   For who, when following one in the way, and then on the former falling
   into a pit, would not guard against incurring equal danger, by taking
   care not to follow him in his slip? What athlete, again, who has
   learned the way to glory, and has seen the combatant who had preceded
   him receiving the prize, does not exert himself for the crown,
   imitating the elder one?

   Such images of divine wisdom are many; but I shall mention one
   instance, and expound it in a few words. The fate of the Sodomites was
   judgment to those who had done wrong, instruction to those who hear.
   The Sodomites having, through much luxury, fallen into uncleanness,
   practising adultery shamelessly, and burning with insane love for boys;
   the All-seeing Word, whose notice those who commit impieties cannot
   escape, cast His eye on them. Nor did the sleepless guard of humanity
   observe their licentiousness in silence; but dissuading us from the
   imitation of them, and training us up to His own temperance, and
   falling on some sinners, lest lust being unavenged, should break loose
   from all the restraints of fear, ordered Sodom to be burned, pouring
   forth a little of the sagacious fire on licentiousness; lest lust,
   through want of punishment, should throw wide the gates to those that
   were rushing into voluptuousness. Accordingly, the just punishment of
   the Sodomites became to men an image of the salvation which is well
   calculated for men. For those who have not committed like sins with
   those who are punished, will never receive a like punishment. By
   guarding against sinning, we guard against suffering. "For I would have
   you know," says Jude, "that God, having once saved His people from the
   land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed them that believed not; and the
   angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own
   habitation, He hath reserved to the judgment of the great day, in
   everlasting chains under darkness of the savage angels." [1651] And a
   little after he sets forth, in a most instructive manner,
   representations of those that are judged: "Woe unto them, for they have
   gone in the way of Cain, and run greedily after the error of Balaam,
   and perished in the gainsaying of Core." For those, who cannot attain
   the privilege of adoption, fear keeps from growing insolent. For
   punishments and threats are for this end, that fearing the penalty we
   may abstain from sinning. I might relate to you punishments for
   ostentation, and punishments for vainglory, not only for
   licentiousness; and adduce the censures pronounced on those whose
   hearts are bad through wealth, [1652] in which censures the Word
   through fear restrains from evil acts. But sparing prolixity in my
   treatise, I shall bring forward the following precepts of the
   Instructor, that you may guard against His threatenings.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1645] The word used by Clement here for frugality is euteleia, and he
   supposes the word to mean originally "spending well." A proper way of
   spending money is as good as unfailing riches, since it always has
   enough for all that is necessary.

      Chapter IX.--Why We are to Use the Bath.

   There are, then, four reasons for the bath (for from that point I
   digressed in my oration), for which we frequent it: for cleanliness, or
   heat, or health, or lastly, for pleasure. Bathing for pleasure is to be
   omitted. For unblushing pleasure must be cut out by the roots; and the
   bath is to be taken by women for cleanliness and health, by men for
   health alone. [1653] To bathe for the sake of heat is a superfluity,
   since one may restore what is frozen by the cold in other ways.
   Constant use of the bath, too, impairs strength and relaxes the
   physical energies, and often induces debility and fainting. For in a
   way the body drinks, like trees, not only by the mouth, but also over
   the whole body in bathing, by what they call the pores. In proof of
   this often people, when thirsty, by going afterwards into the water,
   have assuaged their thirst. Unless, then, the bath is for some use, we
   ought not to indulge in it. The ancients called them places for fulling
   [1654] men, since they wrinkle men's bodies sooner than they ought, and
   by cooking them, as it were, compel them to become prematurely old. The
   flesh, like iron, being softened by the heat, hence we require cold, as
   it were, to temper and give an edge. Nor must we bathe always; but if
   one is a little exhausted, or, on the other hand, filled to repletion,
   the bath is to be forbidden, regard being had to the age of the body
   and the season of the year. For the bath is not beneficial to all, or
   always, as those who are skilled in these things own. But due
   proportion, which on all occasions we call as our helper in life,
   suffices for us. For we must not so use the bath as to require an
   assistant, nor are we to bathe constantly and often in the day as we
   frequent the market-place. But to have the water poured over us by
   several people is an outrage on our neighbours, through fondness for
   luxuriousness, and is done by those who will not understand that the
   bath is common to all the bathers equally.

   But most of all is it necessary to wash the soul in the cleansing Word
   (sometimes the body too, on account of the dirt which gathers and grows
   to it, sometimes also to relieve fatigue). "Woe unto you, scribes and
   Pharisees, hypocrites!" saith the Lord, "for ye are like to whited
   sepulchres. Without, the sepulchre appears beautiful, but within it is
   full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness." [1655] And again He says
   to the same people, "Woe unto you! for ye cleanse the outside of the
   cup and platter, but within are full of uncleanness. Cleanse first the
   inside of the cup, that the outside may be clean also." [1656] The best
   bath, then, is what rubs off the pollution of the soul, and is
   spiritual. Of which prophecy speaks expressly: "The Lord will wash away
   the filth of the sons and daughters of Israel, and will purge the blood
   from the midst of them" [1657] --the blood of crime and the murders of
   the prophets. And the mode of cleansing, the Word subjoined, saying,
   "by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning." The bathing
   which is carnal, that is to say, of the body, is accomplished by water
   alone, as often in the country where there is not a bath. [1658]

      Chapter X.--The Exercises Suited to a Good Life.

   The gymnasium is sufficient for boys, even if a bath is within reach.
   And even for men to prefer gymnastic exercises by far to the baths, is
   perchance not bad, since they are in some respects conducive to the
   health of young men, and produce exertion--emulation to aim at not only
   a healthy habit of body, but courageousness of soul. When this is done
   without dragging a man away from better employments, it is pleasant,
   and not unprofitable. Nor are women to be deprived of bodily exercise.
   But they are not to be encouraged to engage in wrestling or running,
   but are to exercise themselves in spinning, and weaving, and
   superintending the cooking if necessary. And they are, with their own
   hand, to fetch from the store what we require. And it is no disgrace
   for them to apply themselves to the mill. Nor is it a reproach to a
   wife--housekeeper and helpmeet--to occupy herself in cooking, so that
   it may be palatable to her husband. And if she shake up the couch,
   reach drink to her husband when thirsty, set food on the table as
   neatly as possible, and so give herself exercise tending to sound
   health, the Instructor will approve of a woman like this, who
   "stretches forth her arms to useful tasks, rests her hands on the
   distaff, opens her hand to the poor, and extends her wrist to the
   beggar." [1659]

   She who emulates Sarah is not ashamed of that highest of ministries,
   helping wayfarers. For Abraham said to her, "Haste, and knead three
   measures of meal, and make cakes." [1660] "And Rachel, the daughter of
   Laban, came," it is said, "with her father's sheep." [1661] Nor was
   this enough; but to teach humility it is added, "for she fed her
   father's sheep." [1662] And innumerable such examples of frugality and
   self-help, and also of exercises, are furnished by the Scriptures. In
   the case of men, let some strip and engage in wrestling; let some play
   at the small ball, especially the game they call Pheninda, [1663] in
   the sun. To others who walk into the country, or go down into the town,
   the walk is sufficient exercise. And were they to handle the hoe, this
   stroke of economy in agricultural labour would not be ungentleman like.

   I had almost forgot to say that the well-known Pittacus, king of
   Miletus, practiced the laborious exercise of turning the mill. [1664]
   It is respectable for a man to draw water for himself, and to cut
   billets of wood which he is to use himself. Jacob fed the sheep of
   Laban that were left in his charge, having as a royal badge "a rod of
   storax," [1665] which aimed by its wood to change and improve nature.
   And reading aloud is often an exercise to many. But let not such
   athletic contests, as we have allowed, be undertaken for the sake of
   vainglory, but for the exuding of manly sweat. Nor are we to straggle
   with cunning and showiness, but in a stand-up wrestling bout, by
   disentangling of neck, hands, and sides. For such a struggle with
   graceful strength is more becoming and manly, being undertaken for the
   sake of serviceable and profitable health. But let those others, who
   profess the practice of illiberal postures in gymnastics, be dismissed.
   We must always aim at moderation. For as it is best that labour should
   precede food, so to labour above measure is both very bad, very
   exhausting, and apt to make us ill. Neither, then, should we be idle
   altogether, nor completely fatigued. For similarly to what we have laid
   down with respect to food, are we to do everywhere and with everything.
   Our mode of life is not to accustom us to voluptuousness and
   licentiousness, nor to the opposite extreme, but to the medium between
   these, that which is harmonious and temperate, and free of either evil,
   luxury and parsimony. And now, as we have also previously remarked,
   attending to one's own wants is an exercise free of pride,--as, for
   example, putting on one's own shoes, washing one's own feet, and also
   rubbing one's self when anointed with oil. To render one who has rubbed
   you the same service in return, is an exercise of reciprocal justice;
   and to sleep beside a sick friend, help the infirm, and supply him who
   is in want, are proper exercises. "And Abraham," it is said, "served up
   for three, dinner under a tree, and waited on them as they ate." [1666]
   The same with fishing, [1667] as in the case of Peter, if we have
   leisure from necessary instructions in the Word. But that is the better
   enjoyment which the Lord assigned to the disciple, when He taught him
   to "catch men" as fishes in the water.

      Chapter XI.--A Compendious View of the Christian Life.

   Wherefore the wearing of gold and the use of softer clothing is not to
   be entirely prohibited. But irrational impulses must be curbed, lest,
   carrying us away through excessive relaxation, they impel us to
   voluptuousness. For luxury, that has dashed on to surfeit, is prone to
   kick up its heels and toss its mane, and shake off the charioteer, the
   Instructor; who, pulling back the reins from far, leads and drives to
   salvation the human horse--that is, the irrational part of the
   soul--which is wildly bent on pleasures, and vicious appetites, and
   precious stones, and gold, and variety of dress, and other luxuries.

   Above all, we are to keep in mind what was spoken sacredly: "Having
   your conversation honest among the Gentiles; that, whereas they speak
   against you as evil-doers, they may, by the good works which they
   behold, glorify God." [1668]

        Clothes.

   The Instructor permits us, then, to use simple clothing, and of a white
   colour, as we said before. So that, accommodating ourselves not to
   variegated art, but to nature as it is produced, and pushing away
   whatever is deceptive and belies the truth, we may embrace the
   uniformity and simplicity of the truth. [1669]

   Sophocles, reproaching a youth, says:--


   "Decked in women's clothes."

   For, as in the case of the soldier, the sailor, and the ruler, so also
   the proper dress of the temperate man is what is plain, becoming, and
   clean. Whence also in the law, the law enacted by Moses about leprousy
   rejects what has many colours and spots, like the various scales of the
   snake. He therefore wishes man, no longer decking himself gaudily in a
   variety of colours, but white all over from the crown of the head to
   the sole of the foot, to be clean; so that, by a transition from the
   body, we may lay aside the varied and versatile passions of the man,
   and love the unvaried, and unambiguous, and simple colour of truth. And
   he who also in this emulates Moses--Plato best of all--approves of that
   texture on which not more than a chaste woman's work has been employed.
   And white colours well become gravity. And elsewhere he says, "Nor
   apply dyes or weaving, except for warlike decorations." [1670]

   To men of peace and of light, therefore, white is appropriate. [1671]
   As, then, signs, which are very closely allied to causes, by their
   presence indicate, or rather demonstrate, the existence of the result;
   as smoke is the sign of fire, and a good complexion and a regular pulse
   of health; so also clothing of this description shows the character of
   our habits. Temperance is pure and simple; since purity is a habit
   which ensures pure conduct unmixed with what is base. Simplicity is a
   habit which does away with superfluities.

   Substantial clothing also, and chiefly what is unfulled, protects the
   heat which is in the body; not that the clothing has heat in itself,
   but that it turns back the heat issuing from the body, and refuses it a
   passage. And whatever heat falls upon it, it absorbs and retains, and
   being warmed by it, warms in turn the body. And for this reason it is
   chiefly to be worn in winter.

   It also (temperance) is contented. And contentment is a habit which
   dispenses with superfluities, and, that there may be no failure, is
   receptive of what suffices for the healthful and blessed life according
   to the Word. [1672]

   Let the women wear a plain and becoming dress, but softer than what is
   suitable for a man, yet not quite immodest or entirely gone in luxury.
   And let the garments be suited to age, person, figure, nature,
   pursuits. For the divine apostle most beautifully counsels us "to put
   on Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the lusts of the flesh."
   [1673]

        Ear-rings.

   The Word prohibits us from doing violence to nature [1674] by boring
   the lobes of the ears. For why not the nose too?--so that, what was
   spoken, may be fulfilled: "As an ear-ring in a swine's nose, so is
   beauty to a woman without discretion." [1675] For, in a word, if one
   thinks himself made beautiful by gold, he is inferior to gold; and he
   that is inferior to gold is not lord of it. But to confess one's self
   less ornamental than the Lydian ore, how monstrous! As, then, the gold
   is polluted by the dirtiness of the sow, which stirs up the mire with
   her snout, so those women that are luxurious to excess in their
   wantonness, elated by wealth, dishonour by the stains of amatory
   indulgences what is the true beauty.

        Finger-rings.

   The Word, then, permits them a finger-ring of gold. [1676] Nor is this
   for ornament, but for sealing things which are worth keeping safe in
   the house in the exercise of their charge of housekeeping.

   For if all were well trained, there would be no need of seals, if
   servants and masters were equally honest. But since want of training
   produces an inclination to dishonesty, we require seals.

   But there are circumstances in which this strictness may relaxed. For
   allowance must sometimes be made in favour of those women who have not
   been fortunate [1677] in falling in with chaste husbands, and adorn
   themselves in order to please their husbands. But let desire for the
   admiration of their husbands alone be proposed as their aim. I would
   not have them to devote themselves to personal display, but to attract
   their husbands by chaste love for them--a powerful and legitimate
   charm. But since they wish their wives to be unhappy in mind, let the
   latter, if they would be chaste, make it their aim to allay by degrees
   the irrational impulses and passions of their husbands. And they are to
   be gently drawn to simplicity, by gradually accustoming them to
   sobriety. For decency is not produced by the imposition of what is
   burdensome, but by the abstraction of excess. For women's articles of
   luxury are to be prohibited, as things of swift wing producing unstable
   follies and empty delights; by which, elated and furnished with wings,
   they often fly away from the marriage bonds. Wherefore also women ought
   to dress neatly, and bind themselves around with the band of chaste
   modesty, lest through giddiness they slip away from the truth. It is
   right, then, for men to repose confidence in their wives, and commit
   the charge of the household to them, as they are given to be their
   helpers in this.

   And if it is necessary for us, while engaged in public business, or
   discharging other avocations in the country, and often away from our
   wives, to seal anything for the sake of safety, He (the Word) allows us
   a signet for this purpose only. Other finger-rings are to be cast off,
   since, according to the Scripture, "instruction is a golden ornament
   for a wise man." [1678]

   But women who wear gold seem to me to be afraid, lest, if one strip
   them of their jewellery, they should be taken for servants, without
   their ornaments. But the nobility of truth, discovered in the native
   beauty which has its seat in the soul, judges the slave not by buying
   and selling, but by a servile disposition. And it is incumbent on us
   not to seem, but to be free, trained by God, adopted by God.

   Wherefore we must adopt a mode of standing and motion, and a step, and
   dress, and in a word, a mode of life, in all respects as worthy as
   possible of freemen. But men are not to wear the ring on the joint; for
   this is feminine; but to place it on the little finger at its root. For
   so the hand will be freest for work, in whatever we need it; and the
   signet will not very easily fall off, being guarded by the large knot
   of the joint.

   And let our seals be either a dove, or a fish, or a ship scudding
   before the wind, or a musical lyre, which Polycrates used, or a ship's
   anchor, which Seleucus got engraved as a device; and if there be one
   fishing, he will remember the apostle, and the children drawn out of
   the water. For we are not to delineate the faces of idols, [1679] we
   who are prohibited to cleave to them; nor a sword, nor a bow, following
   as we do, peace; nor drinking-cups, being temperate.

   Many of the licentious have their lovers [1680] engraved, [1681] or
   their mistresses, as if they wished to make it impossible ever to
   forget their amatory indulgences, by being perpetually put in mind of
   their licentiousness.

        The Hair.

   About the hair, the following seems right. Let the head of men be
   shaven, unless it has curly hair. But let the chin have the hair. But
   let not twisted locks hang far down from the head, gliding into
   womanish ringlets. For an ample beard suffices for men. And if one,
   too, shave a part of his beard, it must not be made entirely bare, for
   this is a disgraceful sight. The shaving of the chin to the skin is
   reprehensible, approaching to plucking out the hair and smoothing. For
   instance, thus the Psalmist, delighted with the hair of the beard,
   says, "As the ointment that descends on the beard, the beard of Aaron."
   [1682]

   Having celebrated the beauty of the beard by a repetition, he made the
   face to shine with the ointment of the Lord.

   Since cropping is to be adopted not for the sake of elegance, but on
   account of the necessity of the case; the hair of the head, that it may
   not grow so long as to come down and interfere with the eyes, and that
   of the moustache similarly, which is dirtied in eating, is to be cut
   round, not by the razor, for that were not well-bred, but by a pair of
   cropping scissors. But the hair on the chin is not to be disturbed, as
   it gives no trouble, and lends to the face dignity and paternal terror.
   [1683]

   Moreover, the shape instructs many not to sin, because it renders
   detection easy. To those who do [not] [1684] wish to sin openly, a
   habit that will escape observation and is not conspicuous is most
   agreeable, which, when assumed, will allow them to transgress without
   detection; so that, being undistinguishable from others, they may
   fearlessly go their length in sinning. [1685] A cropped head not only
   shows a man to be grave, but renders the cranium less liable to injury,
   by accustoming it to the presence of both cold and heat; and it averts
   the mischiefs arising from these, which the hair absorbs into itself
   like a sponge, and so inflicts on the brain constant mischief from the
   moisture.

   It is enough for women to protect [1686] their locks, and bind up their
   hair simply along the neck with a plain hair-pin, nourishing chaste
   locks with simple care to true beauty. For meretricious plaiting of the
   hair, and putting it up in tresses, contribute to make them look ugly,
   cutting the hair and plucking off it those treacherous braidings; on
   account of which they do not touch their head, being afraid of
   disordering their hair. Sleep, too, comes on, not without fear lest
   they pull down without knowing the shape of the braid.

   But additions of other people's hair are entirely to be rejected, and
   it is a most sacrilegious thing for spurious hair to shade the head,
   covering the skull with dead locks. For on whom does the presbyter lay
   his hand? [1687] Whom does he bless? Not the woman decked out, but
   another's hair, and through them another head. And if "the man is head
   of the woman, and God of the man," [1688] how is it not impious that
   they should fall into double sins? For they deceive the men by the
   excessive quantity of their hair; and shame the Lord as far as in them
   lies, by adorning themselves meretriciously, in order to dissemble the
   truth. And they defame the head, which is truly beautiful.

   Consequently neither is the hair to be dyed, nor grey hair to have its
   colour changed. For neither are we allowed to diversify our dress. And
   above all, old age, which conciliates trust, is not to be concealed.
   But God's mark of honour is to be shown in the light of day, to win the
   reverence of the young. For sometimes, when they have been behaving
   shamefully, the appearance of hoary hairs, arriving like an instructor,
   has changed them to sobriety, and paralyzed juvenile lust with the
   splendour of the sight.

        Painting the Face.

   Nor are the women to smear their faces with the ensnaring devices of
   wily cunning. But let us show to them the decoration of sobriety. For,
   in the first place, the best beauty is that which is spiritual, as we
   have often pointed out. For when the soul is adorned by the Holy
   Spirit, and inspired with the radiant charms which proceed from
   Him,--righteousness, wisdom, fortitude, temperance, love of the good,
   modesty, than which no more blooming colour was ever seen,--then let
   corporeal beauty be cultivated too, symmetry of limbs and members, with
   a fair complexion. The adornment of health is here in place, through
   which the transition of the artificial image to the truth, in
   accordance with the form which has been given by God, is effected. But
   temperance in drinks, and moderation in articles of food, are effectual
   in producing beauty according to nature; for not only does the body
   maintain its health from these, but they also make beauty to appear.
   For from what is fiery arises a gleam and sparkle; and from moisture,
   brightness and grace; and from dryness, strength and firmness; and from
   what is aërial, free-breathing and equipoise; from which this
   well-proportioned and beautiful image of the Word is adorned. Beauty is
   the free flower of health; for the latter is produced within the body;
   while the former, blossoming out from the body, exhibits manifest
   beauty of complexion. Accordingly, these most decorous and healthful
   practices, by exercising the body, produce true and lasting beauty, the
   heat attracting to itself all the moisture and cold spirit. Heat, when
   agitated by moving causes, is a thing which attracts to itself; and
   when it does attract, it gently exhales through the flesh itself, when
   warmed, the abundance of food, with some moisture, but with excess of
   heat. Wherefore also the first food is carried off. But when the body
   is not moved, the food consumed does not adhere, but falls away, as the
   loaf from a cold oven, either entire, or leaving only the lower part.
   Accordingly, the foeces are in excess in the case of those who do not
   throw off the excrementitious matters by the rubbings necessitated by
   exercise. And other superfluous matters abound in their case too, and
   also perspiration, as the food is not assimilated by the body, but is
   flowing out to waste. Thence also lusts are excited, the redundance
   flowing to the pudenda by commensurate motions. Wherefore this
   redundance ought to be liquefied and dispersed for digestion, by which
   beauty acquires its ruddy hue. But it is monstrous for those who are
   made in "the image and likeness of God," to dishonour the archetype by
   assuming a foreign ornament, preferring the mischievous contrivance of
   man to the divine creation.

   The Instructor orders them to go forth "in becoming apparel, and adorn
   themselves with shamefacedness and sobriety," [1689] "subject to their
   own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they may without the word
   be won by the conversation of the wives; while they behold," he says,
   "your chaste conversation. Whose adorning, let it not be that outward
   adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on
   of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
   not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is
   in the sight of God of great price." [1690]

   For the labour of their own hands, above all, adds genuine beauty to
   women, exercising their bodies and adorning themselves by their own
   exertions; not bringing unornamental ornament wrought by others, which
   is vulgar and meretricious, but that of every good woman, supplied and
   woven by her own hands whenever she most requires. For it is never
   suitable for women whose lives are framed according to God, to appear
   arrayed in things bought from the market, but in their own home-made
   work. For a most beautiful thing is a thrifty wife, who clothes both
   herself and her husband with fair array of her own working; [1691] in
   which all are glad--the children on account of their mother, the
   husband on account of his wife, she on their account, and all in God.

   In brief, "A store of excellence is a woman of worth, who eateth not
   the bread of idleness; and the laws of mercy are on her tongue; who
   openeth her mouth wisely and rightly; whose children rise up and call
   her blessed," as the sacred Word says by Solomon: "Her husband also,
   and he praiseth her. For a pious woman is blessed; and let her praise
   the fear of the Lord." [1692]

   And again, "A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband." [1693] They
   must, as far as possible, correct their gestures, looks, steps, and
   speech. For they must not do as some, who, imitating the acting of
   comedy, and practising the mincing motions of dancers, conduct
   themselves in society as if on the stage, with voluptuous movements,
   and gliding steps, and affected voices, casting languishing glances
   round, tricked out with the bait of pleasure. "For honey drops from the
   lips of a woman who is an harlot; who, speaking to please, lubricates
   thy throat. But at last thou wilt find it bitterer than bile, and
   sharper than a two-edged sword. For the feet of folly lead those who
   practice it to hell after death." [1694]

   The noble Samson was overcome by the harlot, and by another woman was
   shorn of his manhood. But Joseph was not thus beguiled by another
   woman. The Egyptian harlot was conquered. And chastity, [1695] assuming
   to itself bonds, appears superior to dissolute licence. Most excellent
   is what has been said:--


   "In fine, I know not how

   To whisper, nor effeminately,

   To walk about with my neck awry,

   As I see others--lechers there

   In numbers in the city, with hair plucked out." [1696]

   But feminine motions, dissoluteness, and luxury, are to be entirely
   prohibited. For voluptuousness of motion in walking, "and a mincing
   gait," as Anacreon says, are altogether meretricious.

   "As seems to me," says the comedy, "it is time [1697] to abandon
   meretricious steps and luxury." And the steps of harlotry lean not to
   the truth; for they approach not the paths of life. Her tracks are
   dangerous, and not easily known. [1698] The eyes especially are to be
   sparingly used, since it is better to slip with the feet than with the
   eyes. [1699] Accordingly, the Lord very summarily cures this malady:
   "If thine eye offend thee, cut it out," [1700] He says, dragging lust
   up from the foundation. But languishing looks, and ogling, which is to
   wink with the eyes, is nothing else than to commit adultery with the
   eyes, lust skirmishing through them. For of the whole body, the eyes
   are first destroyed. "The eye contemplating beautiful objects (kala),
   gladdens the heart;" that is, the eye which has learned rightly (kalos)
   to see, gladdens. "Winking with the eye, with guile, heaps woes on
   men." [1701] Such they introduce the effeminate Sardanapalus, king of
   the Assyrians, sitting on a couch with his legs up, fumbling at his
   purple robe, and casting up the whites of his eyes. Women that follow
   such practices, by their looks offer themselves for prostitution. "For
   the light of the body is the eye," says the Scripture, by which the
   interior illuminated by the shining light appears. Fornication in a
   woman is in the raising of the eyes. [1702]

   "Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
   uncleanness, inordinate affection, and concupiscence, and covetousness,
   which is idolatry: for which things' sake cometh the wrath of God upon
   the children of disobedience," [1703] cries the apostle.

   But we enkindle the passions, and are not ashamed.

   Some of these women eating mastich, [1704] going about, show their
   teeth to those that come near. And others, as if they had not fingers,
   give themselves airs, scratching their heads with pins; and these made
   either of tortoise or ivory, or some other dead creature they procure
   at much pains. And others, as if they had certain efflorescences, in
   order to appear comely in the eyes of spectators, stain their faces by
   adorning them with gay-coloured unguents. Such a one is called by
   Solomon "a foolish and bold woman," who "knows not shame. She sits at
   the door of her house, conspicuously in a seat, calling to all that
   pass by the way, who go right on their ways;" by her style and whole
   life manifestly saying, "Who among you is very silly? let him turn to
   me." And those devoid of wisdom she exhorts, saying, "Touch sweetly
   secret bread, and sweet stolen water;" meaning by this, clandestine
   love (from this point the Boeotian Pindar, coming to our help, says,
   "The clandestine pursuit of love is something sweet"). But the
   miserable man "knoweth not that the sons of earth perish beside her,
   and that she tends to the level of hell." But says the Instructor: "Hie
   away, and tarry not in the place; nor fix thine eye on her: for thus
   shalt thou pass over a strange water, and cross to Acheron." [1705]
   Wherefore thus saith the Lord by Isaiah, "Because the daughters of Sion
   walk with lofty neck, and with winkings of the eyes, and sweeping their
   garments as they walk, and playing with their feet; the Lord shall
   humble the daughters of Sion, and will uncover their form" [1706]
   --their deformed form. I, deem it wrong that servant girls, who follow
   women of high rank, should either speak or act unbecomingly to them.
   But I think it right that they should be corrected by their mistresses.
   With very sharp censure, accordingly, the comic poet Philemon says:
   "You may follow at the back of a pretty servant girl, seen behind a
   gentlewoman; and any one from the Platæicum may follow close, and ogle
   her." For the wantonness of the servant recoils on the mistress;
   allowing those who attempt to take lesser liberties not to be afraid to
   advance to greater; since the mistress, by allowing improprieties,
   shows that she does not disapprove of them. And not to be angry at
   those who act wantonly, is a clear proof of a disposition inclining to
   the like. "For like mistress like wench," [1707] as they say in the
   proverb.

        Walking.

   Also we must abandon a furious mode of walking, and choose a grave and
   leisurely, but not a lingering step.

   Nor is one to swagger in the ways, nor throw back his head to look at
   those he meets, if they look at him, as if he were strutting on the
   stage, and pointed at with the finger. Nor, when pushing up hill, are
   they to be shoved up by their domestics, as we see those that are more
   luxurious, who appear strong, but are enfeebled by effeminacy of soul.

   A true gentleman must have no mark of effeminacy visible on his face,
   or any other part of his body. Let no blot on his manliness, then, be
   ever found either in his movements or habits. Nor is a man in health to
   use his servants as horses to bear him. For as it is enjoined on them,
   "to be subject to their masters with all fear, not only to the good and
   gentle, but also to the froward," [1708] as Peter says; so fairness,
   and forbearance, and kindness, are what well becomes the masters. For
   he says: "Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of
   another; love as brethren, be pitiful, be humble," and so forth, "that
   ye may inherit a blessing," [1709] excellent and desirable.

        The Model Maiden.

   Zeno the Cittiæan thought fit to represent the image of a young maid,
   and executed the statue thus: "Let her face be clean, her eyebrows not
   let down, nor her eyelids open nor turned back. Let her neck not be
   stretched back, nor the members of her body be loose. But let the parts
   that hang from the body look as if they were well strung; let there be
   the keenness of a well-regulated mind [1710] for discourse, and
   retention of what has been rightly spoken; and let her attitudes and
   movements give no ground of hope to the licentious; but let there be
   the bloom of modesty, and an expression of firmness. But far from her
   be the wearisome trouble that comes from the shops of perfumers, and
   goldsmiths, and dealers in wool, and that which comes from the other
   shops where women, meretriciously dressed, pass whole days as if
   sitting in the stews."

        Amusements and Associates.

   And let not men, therefore, spend their time in barbers' shops and
   taverns, babbling nonsense; and let them give up hunting for the women
   who sit near, [1711] and ceaselessly talking slander against many to
   raise a laugh.

   The game of dice [1712] is to be prohibited, and the pursuit of gain,
   especially by dicing, [1713] which many keenly follow. Such things the
   prodigality of luxury invents for the idle. For the cause is idleness,
   and a love [1714] for frivolities apart from the truth. For it is not
   possible otherwise to obtain enjoyment without injury; and each man's
   preference of a mode of life is a counterpart of his disposition.

   But, as appears, only intercourse with good men benefits; on the other
   hand, the all-wise Instructor, by the mouth of Moses, recognising
   companionship with bad men as swinish, forbade the ancient people to
   partake of swine; to point out that those who call on God ought not to
   mingle with unclean men, who, like swine, delight in corporeal
   pleasures, in impure food, and in itching with filthy pruriency after
   the mischievous delights of lewdness.

   Further, He says: "Thou art not to eat a kite or swift-winged ravenous
   bird, or an eagle," [1715] meaning: Thou shalt not come near men who
   gain their living by rapine. And other things also are exhibited
   figuratively.

   With whom, then, are we to associate? With the righteous, He says
   again, speaking figuratively; for everything "which parts the hoof and
   chews the cud is clean." For the parting of the hoof indicates the
   equilibrium of righteousness, and ruminating points to the proper food
   of righteousness, the word, which enters from without, like food, by
   instruction, but is recalled from the mind, as from the stomach, to
   rational recollection. And the spiritual man, having the word in his
   mouth, ruminates the spiritual food; and righteousness parts the hoof
   rightly, because it sanctifies us in this life, and sends us on our way
   to the world to come.

        Public Spectacles.

   The Instructor will not then bring us to public spectacles; nor
   inappropriately might one call the racecourse and the theatre "the seat
   of plagues;" [1716] for there is evil counsel as against the Just One,
   [1717] and therefore the assembly against Him is execrated. These
   assemblies, indeed, are full of confusion [1718] and iniquity; and
   these pretexts for assembling are the cause of disorder--men and women
   assembling promiscuously if for the sight of one another. In this
   respect the assembly has already shown itself bad: for when the eye is
   lascivious, [1719] the desires grow warm; and the eyes that are
   accustomed to look impudently at one's neighbours during the leisure
   granted to them, inflame the amatory desires. Let spectacles,
   therefore, and plays that are full of scurrility and of abundant
   gossip, be forbidden. [1720] For what base action is it that is not
   exhibited in the theatres? And what shameless saying is it that is not
   brought forward by the buffoons? And those who enjoy the evil that is
   in them, stamp the clear images of it at home. And, on the other hand,
   those that are proof against these things, and unimpressible, will
   never make a stumble in regard to luxurious pleasures.

   For if people shall say that they betake themselves to the spectacles
   as a pastime for recreation, I should say that the cities which make a
   serious business of pastime are not wise; for cruel contests for glory
   which have been so fatal are not sport. No more is senseless
   expenditure of money, nor are the riots that are occasioned by them
   sport. And ease of mind is not to be purchased by zealous pursuit of
   frivolities, for no one who has his senses will ever prefer what is
   pleasant to what is good.

        Religion in Ordinary Life.

   But it is said we do not all philosophize. Do we not all, then, follow
   after life? What sayest thou? How hast thou believed? How, pray, dost
   thou love God and thy neighbour, if thou dost not philosophize? And how
   dost thou love thyself, if thou dost not love life? It is said, I have
   not learned letters; but if thou hast not learned to read, thou canst
   not excuse thyself in the case of hearing, for it is not taught. And
   faith is the possession not of the wise according to the world, but of
   those according to God; and it is taught without letters; and its
   handbook, at once rude and divine, is called love--a spiritual book. It
   is in your power to listen to divine wisdom, ay, and to frame your life
   in accordance with it. Nay, you are not prohibited from conducting
   affairs in the world decorously according to God. Let not him who sells
   or buys aught name two prices for what he buys or sells; but stating
   the net price, and studying to speak the truth, if he get not his
   price, he gets the truth, and is rich in the possession of rectitude.
   But, above all, let an oath on account of what is sold be far from you;
   and let swearing, too, on account of other things be banished.

   And in this way those who frequent the market-place and the shop
   philosophize. "For thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
   vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in
   vain." [1721]

   But those who act contrary to these things--the avaricious, the liars,
   the hypocrites, those who make merchandise of the truth--the Lord cast
   out of His Father's court, [1722] not willing that the holy house of
   God should be the house of unrighteous traffic either in words or in
   material things.

        Going to Church.

   Woman and man are to go to church [1723] decently attired, with natural
   step, embracing silence, possessing unfeigned love, pure in body, pure
   in heart, fit to pray to God. Let the woman observe this, further. Let
   her be entirely covered, unless she happen to be at home. For that
   style of dress is grave, and protects from being gazed at. And she will
   never fall, who puts before her eyes modesty, and her shawl; nor will
   she invite another to fall into sin by uncovering her face. For this is
   the wish of the Word, since it is becoming for her to pray veiled.
   [1724]

   They say that the wife of Æneas, through excess of propriety, did not,
   even in her terror at the capture of Troy, uncover herself; but, though
   fleeing from the conflagration, remained veiled.

        Out of Church.

   Such ought those who are consecrated to Christ appear, and frame
   themselves in their whole life, as they fashion themselves in the
   church [1725] for the sake of gravity; and to be, not to seem such--so
   meek, so pious, so loving. But now I know not how people change their
   fashions and manners with the place. As they say that polypi,
   assimilated to the rocks to which they adhere, are in colour such as
   they; so, laying aside the inspiration of the assembly, after their
   departure from it, they become like others with whom they associate.
   Nay, in laying aside the artificial mask of solemnity, they are proved
   to be what they secretly were. After having paid reverence to the
   discourse about God, they leave within [the church] what they have
   heard. And outside they foolishly amuse themselves with impious
   playing, and amatory quavering, occupied with flute-playing, and
   dancing, and intoxication, and all kinds of trash. They who sing thus,
   and sing in response, are those who before hymned immortality,--found
   at last wicked and wickedly singing this most pernicious palinode, "Let
   us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." But not to-morrow in truth,
   but already, are these dead to God; burying their dead, [1726] that is,
   sinking themselves down to death. The apostle very firmly assails them.
   "Be not deceived; neither adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of
   themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
   railers," and whatever else he adds to these, "shall inherit the
   kingdom of God." [1727]

        Love and the Kiss of Charity.

   And if we are called to the kingdom of God, let us walk worthy of the
   kingdom, loving God and our neighbour. But love is not proved by a
   kiss, but by kindly feeling. But there are those, that do nothing but
   make the churches resound with a kiss, [1728] not having love itself
   within. For this very thing, the shameless use of a kiss, which ought
   to be mystic, occasions foul suspicions and evil reports. The apostle
   calls the kiss holy. [1729]

   When the kingdom is worthily tested, we dispense the affection of the
   soul by a chaste and closed mouth, by which chiefly gentle manners are
   expressed.

   But there is another unholy kiss, full of poison, counterfeiting
   sanctity. Do you not know that spiders, merely by touching the mouth,
   afflict men with pain? And often kisses inject the poison of
   licentiousness. It is then very manifest to us, that a kiss is not
   love. For the love meant is the love of God. "And this is the love of
   God," says John, "that we keep His commandments;" [1730] not that we
   stroke each other on the mouth. "And His commandments are not
   grievous." But salutations of beloved ones in the ways, full as they
   are of foolish boldness, are characteristic of those who wish to be
   conspicuous to those without, and have not the least particle of grace.
   For if it is proper mystically "in the closet" to pray to God, it will
   follow that we are also to greet mystically our neighbour, whom we are
   commanded to love second similarly to God, within doors, "redeeming the
   time." "For we are the salt of the earth." [1731] "Whosoever shall
   bless his friend early in the morning with a loud voice, shall be
   regarded not to differ from cursing." [1732]

        The Government of the Eyes.

   But, above all, it seems right that we turn away from the sight of
   women. For it is sin not only to touch, but to look; and he who is
   rightly trained must especially avoid them. "Let thine eyes look
   straight, and thine eyelids wink right." [1733] For while it is
   possible for one who looks to remain stedfast; yet care must be taken
   against falling. For it is possible for one who looks to slip; but it
   is impossible for one, who looks not, to lust. For it is not enough for
   the chaste to be pure; but they must give all diligence, to be beyond
   the range of censure, shutting out all ground of suspicion, in order to
   the consummation of chastity; so that we may not only be faithful, but
   appear worthy of trust. For this is also consequently to be guarded
   against, as the apostle says, "that no man should blame us; providing
   things honourable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the
   sight of men." [1734] "But turn away thine eyes from a graceful woman,
   and contemplate not another's beauty," says the Scripture. [1735] And
   if you require the reason, it will further tell you, "For by the beauty
   of woman many have gone astray, and at it affection blazes up like
   fire;" [1736] the affection which arises from the fire which we call
   love, leading to the fire which will never cease in consequence of sin.

      Chapter XII.--Continuation: with Texts from Scripture.

   I would counsel the married never to kiss their wives in the presence
   of their domestics. For Aristotle does not allow people to laugh to
   their slaves. And by no means must a wife be seen saluted in their
   presence. It is moreover better that, beginning at home with marriage,
   we should exhibit propriety in it. For it is the greatest bond of
   chastity, breathing forth pure pleasure. Very admirably the tragedy
   says:--


   "Well! well! ladies, how is it, then, that among men,

   Not gold, not empire, or luxury of wealth,

   Conferred to such an extent signal delights,

   As the right and virtuous disposition

   Of a man of worth and a dutiful wife?"

   Such injunctions of righteousness uttered by those who are conversant
   with worldly wisdom are not to be refused. Knowing, then, the duty of
   each, "pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: forasmuch as ye
   know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, such as silver
   or gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your
   fathers; but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
   blemish and without spot." [1737] "For," says Peter, "the time past of
   our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when
   we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings,
   banquetings, and abominable idolatries." [1738] We have as a limit the
   cross of the Lord, by which we are fenced and hedged about from our
   former sins. Therefore, being regenerated, let us fix ourselves to it
   in truth, and return to sobriety, and sanctify ourselves; "for the eyes
   of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their
   prayer; but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil." [1739]
   And who is he that will harm us, if we be followers of that which is
   good?" [1740] --"us" for "you." But the best training is good order,
   which is perfect decorum, and stable and orderly power, which in action
   maintains consistence in what it does. If these things have been
   adduced by me with too great asperity, in order to effect the salvation
   which follows from your correction; they have been spoken also, says
   the Instructor, by me: "Since he who reproves with boldness is a
   peacemaker." [1741] And if ye hear me, ye shall be saved. And if ye
   attend not to what is spoken, it is not my concern. And yet it is my
   concern thus: "For he desires the repentance rather than the death of a
   sinner." [1742] "If ye shall hear me, ye shall eat the good of the
   land," the Instructor again says, calling by the appellation "the good
   of the land," beauty, wealth, health, strength, sustenance. For those
   things which are really good, are what "neither ear hath heard, not
   hath ever entered into the heart" [1743] respecting Him who is really
   King, and the realities truly good which await us. For He is the giver
   and the guard of good things. And with respect to their participation,
   He applies the same names of things in this world, the Word thus
   training in God the feebleness of men from sensible things to
   understanding.

   What has to be observed at home, and how our life is to be regulated,
   the Instructor has abundantly declared. And the things which He is wont
   to say to children by the way, [1744] while He conducts them to the
   Master, these He suggests, and adduces the Scriptures themselves in a
   compendious form, setting forth bare injunctions, accommodating them to
   the period of guidance, and assigning the interpretation of them to the
   Master. [1745] For the intention of His law is to dissipate fear,
   emancipating free-will in order to faith. "Hear," He says, "O child,"
   who art rightly instructed, the principal points of salvation. For I
   will disclose my ways, and lay before thee good commandments; by which
   thou wilt reach salvation. And I lead thee by the way of salvation.
   Depart from the paths of deceit.

   "For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the
   ungodly shall perish." [1746] "Follow, therefore, O son, the good way
   which I shall describe, lending to me attentive ears." "And I will give
   to thee the treasures of darkness, hidden and unseen" [1747] by the
   nations, but seen by us. And the treasures of wisdom are unfailing, in
   admiration of which the apostle says, "O the depth of the riches and
   the wisdom!" [1748] And by one God are many treasures dispensed; some
   disclosed by the law, others by the prophets; some to the divine mouth,
   and others to the heptad of the spirit singing accordant. And the Lord
   being one, is the same Instructor by all these. Here is then a
   comprehensive precept, and an exhortation of life, all-embracing: "As
   ye would that men should do unto you, do ye likewise to, them." [1749]
   We may comprehend the commandments in two, as the Lord says, "Thou
   shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and
   with all thy strength; and thy neighbour as thyself." Then from these
   He infers, "on this hang the law and the prophets." [1750] Further, to
   him that asked, "What good thing shall I do, that I may inherit eternal
   life?" He answered, "Thou knowest the commandments?" And on him
   replying Yea, He said, "This do, and thou shalt be saved." Especially
   conspicuous is the love of the Instructor set forth in various salutary
   commandments, in order that the discovery may be readier, from the
   abundance and arrangement of the Scriptures. We have the Decalogue
   [1751] given by Moses, which, indicating by an elementary principle,
   simple and of one kind, defines the designation of sins in a way
   conducive to salvation: "Thou shall not commit adultery. Thou shall not
   worship idols. Thou shalt not corrupt boys. Thou shalt not steal. Thou
   shall not bear false witness. Honour thy father and thy mother." [1752]
   And so forth. These things are to be observed, and whatever else is
   commanded in reading the Bible. And He enjoins on us by Isaiah: "Wash
   you, and make you clean. Put away iniquities from your souls before
   mine eyes. Learn to do well. Seek judgment. Deliver the wronged. Judge
   for the orphan, and justify the widow. And come, and let us reason
   together, saith the Lord." [1753] And we shall find many examples also
   in other places,--as, for instance, respecting prayer: "Good works are
   an acceptable prayer to the Lord," says the Scripture. [1754] And the
   manner of prayer is described. "If thou seest," it is said, "the naked,
   cover him; and thou shalt not overlook those who belong to thy seed.
   Then shall thy light spring forth early, and thy healing shall spring
   up quickly; and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory
   of God shall encompass thee." What, then, is the fruit of such prayer?
   "Then shall thou call, and God will hear thee; whilst thou art yet
   speaking, He will say, I am here." [1755]

   In regard to fasting it is said, "Wherefore do ye fast to me? saith the
   Lord. Is it such a fast that I have chosen, even a day for a man to
   humble his soul? Thou shall not bend thy neck like a circle, and spread
   sackcloth and ashes under thee. Not thus shall ye call it an acceptable
   fast."

   What means a fast, then? "Lo, this is the fast which I have chosen,
   saith the Lord. Loose every band of wickedness. Dissolve the knots of
   oppressive contracts. Let the oppressed go free, and tear every unjust
   bond. Break thy bread to the hungry; and lead the houseless poor into
   thy house. If thou see the naked cover him." [1756] About sacrifices
   too: "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? saith
   the Lord. I am full of burnt-offerings and of rams; and the fat of
   lambs, and the blood of bulls and kids I do not wish; nor that ye
   should come to appear before me. Who hath required this at your hands?
   You shall no more tread my court. If ye bring fine flour, the vain
   oblation is an abomination to me. Your new moons and your sabbaths I
   cannot away with." [1757] How, then, shall I sacrifice to the Lord?
   "The sacrifice of the Lord is," He says, "a broken heart." [1758] How,
   then, shall I crown myself, or anoint with ointment, or offer incense
   to the Lord? "An odour of a sweet fragrance," it is said, [1759] "is
   the heart that glorifies Him who made it." These are the crowns and
   sacrifices, aromatic odours, and flowers of God.

   Further, in respect to forbearance. "If thy brother," it is said, "sin
   against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. If he sin
   against thee seven times in a day, and turn to thee the seventh time,
   and say, I repent, forgive him." [1760] Also to the soldiers, by John,
   He commands, "to be content with their wages only;" and to the
   publicans, "to exact no more than is appointed." To the judges He says,
   "Thou shalt not show partiality in judgment. For gifts blind the eyes
   of those who see, and corrupt just words. Rescue the wronged."

   And to householders: "A possession which is acquired with iniquity
   becomes less." [1761]

   Also of "love." "Love," He says, "covers a multitude of sins." [1762]

   And of civil government: "Render to Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's;
   and unto God the things which are God's." [1763]

   Of swearing and the remembrance of injuries: "Did I command your
   fathers, when they went out of Egypt, to offer burnt-offerings and
   sacrifices? But I commanded them, Let none of you bear malice in his
   heart against his neighbour, or love a false oath." [1764]

   The liars and the proud, too, He threatens; the former thus: "Woe to
   them that call bitter sweet, and sweet bitter;" and the latter: "Woe
   unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own
   sight." [1765] "For he that humbleth himself shall be exalted, and he
   that exalteth himself shall be humbled." [1766]

   And "the merciful" He blesses, "for they shall obtain mercy."

   Wisdom pronounces anger a wretched thing, because "it will destroy the
   wise." [1767] And now He bids us "love our enemies, bless them that
   curse us, and pray for them that despitefully use us." And He says: "If
   any one strike thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other also; and
   if any one take away thy coat, hinder him not from taking thy cloak
   also." [1768]

   Of faith He says: "Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye
   shall receive." [1769] "To the unbelieving nothing is trustworthy,"
   according to Pindar.

   Domestics, too, are to be treated like ourselves; for they are human
   beings, as we are. For God is the same to free and bond, if you
   consider.

   Such of our brethren as transgress, we must not punish, but rebuke.
   "For he that spareth the rod hateth his son." [1770]

   Further, He banishes utterly love of glory, saying, "Woe to you,
   Pharisees! for ye love the chief seat in the synagogues, and greetings
   in the markets." [1771] But He welcomes the repentance of the
   sinner--loving repentance--which follows sins. For this Word of whom we
   speak alone is sinless. For to sin is natural and common to all. But to
   return [to God] after sinning is characteristic not of any man, but
   only of a man of worth.

   Respecting liberality He said: "Come to me, ye blessed, inherit the
   kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an
   hungry, and ye gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was
   a stranger, and ye took Me in; naked, and ye clothed Me; sick, and ye
   visited Me; in prison, and ye came unto Me." And when have we done any
   of these things to the Lord?

   The Instructor Himself will say again, loving to refer to Himself the
   kindness of the brethren, "Inasmuch as ye have done it to these least,
   ye have done it to Me. And these shall go away into everlasting life."
   [1772]

   Such are the laws of the Word, the consolatory words not on tables of
   stone which were written by the finger of the Lord, but inscribed on
   men's hearts, on which alone they can remain imperishable. Wherefore
   the tablets of those who had hearts of stone are broken, that the faith
   of the children may be impressed on softened hearts.

   However, both the laws served the Word for the instruction of humanity,
   both that given by Moses and that by the apostles. What, therefore, is
   the nature of the training by the apostles, appears to me to require to
   be treated of. Under this head, I, or rather the Instructor by me,
   [1773] will recount; and I shall again set before you the precepts
   themselves, as it were in the germ.

   "Putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we
   are members one of another. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath;
   neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole steal no more: but
   rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good,
   that he may have to give to him that needeth. Let all bitterness, and
   wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you,
   with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted,
   forgiving one another, as God in Christ hath forgiven you. Be therefore
   wise, [1774] followers of God, as dear children; and walk in love, as
   Christ also hath loved us. Let wives be subject to their own husbands,
   as to the Lord. And let husbands love their wives as Christ also hath
   loved the Church." Let those who are yoked together love one another
   "as their own bodies." "Children, be obedient to your parents. Parents,
   provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up in the nurture
   and admonition of the Lord. Servants, be obedient to those that are
   your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the
   singleness of your hearts, as unto Christ; with good-will from the soul
   doing service. ye masters, treat your servants well, forbearing
   threatening: knowing that both their and your Lord is in heaven; and
   there is no respect of persons with Him." [1775]

   "If we live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit. Let us not be
   desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying one another. Bear
   ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. Be not
   deceived; God is not mocked. Let us not be weary in well-doing: for in
   due time we shall reap, if we faint not." [1776]

   "Be at peace among yourselves. Now we admonish you, brethren, warn them
   who are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient
   toward all men. See that none render evil for evil to any man. Quench
   not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all things: hold fast
   that which is good. Abstain from every form of evil." [1777]

   "Continue in prayer, watching thereunto with thanksgiving. Walk in
   wisdom towards them that are without, redeeming the time. Let your
   speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how
   ye ought to answer every man." [1778]

   "Nourish yourselves up in the words of faith. Exercise yourselves unto
   godliness: for bodily exercise profiteth little; but godliness is
   profitable for all things, having the promise of the life which now is,
   and that which is to come." [1779]

   "Let those who have faithful masters not despise them, because they are
   brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful."
   [1780]

   "He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with
   diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be
   without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which
   is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love, in
   honour preferring one another. Not slothful in business; fervent in
   spirit, serving the Lord. Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation;
   continuing instant in prayer. Given to hospitality; communicating to
   the necessities of the saints." [1781]

   Such are a few injunctions out of many, for the sake of example, which
   the Instructor, running over the divine Scriptures, sets before His
   children; by which, so to speak, vice is cut up by the roots, and
   iniquity is circumscribed.

   Innumerable commands such as these are written in the holy Bible
   appertaining to chosen persons, some to presbyters, some to bishops,
   some to deacons, others to widows, [1782] of whom we shall have another
   opportunity of speaking. Many things spoken in enigmas, many in
   parables, may benefit such as fall in with them. But it is not my
   province, says the Instructor, to teach these any longer. But we need a
   Teacher of the exposition of those sacred words, to whom we must direct
   our steps.

   And now, in truth, it is time for me to cease from my instruction, and
   for you to listen to the Teacher. [1783] And He, receiving you who have
   been trained up in excellent discipline, will teach you the oracles. To
   noble purpose has the Church sung, and the Bridegroom also, the only
   Teacher, the good Counsel, of the good Father, the true Wisdom, the
   Sanctuary of knowledge. "And He is the propitiation for our sins," as
   John says; Jesus, who heals both our body and soul--which are the
   proper man. "And not for our sins only, but also for the whole world.
   And by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. He
   that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar;
   and the truth is not in Him. But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily
   is the love of God perfected. Hereby know we that we are in Him. He
   that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself to walk even as He also
   walked." [1784] O nurslings of His blessed training! let us complete
   the fair face of the church; and let us run as children to our good
   mother. And if we become listeners to the Word, let us glorify the
   blessed dispensation by which man is trained and sanctified as a child
   of God, and has his conversation in heaven, being trained from earth,
   and there receives the Father, whom he learns to know on earth. The
   Word both does and teaches all things, and trains in all things.

   A horse is guided by a bit, and a bull is guided by a yoke, and a wild
   beast is caught in a noose. But man is transformed by the Word, by whom
   wild beasts are tamed, and fishes caught, and birds drawn down. He it
   is, in truth, who fashions the bit for the horse, the yoke for the
   bull, the noose for the wild beast, the rod for the fish, the snare for
   the bird. He both manages the state and tills the ground; commands, and
   helps, and creates the universe.


   "There were figured earth, and sky, and sea,

   The ever-circling sun, and full-orbed moon,

   And all the signs that crown the vault of heaven." [1785]

   O divine works! O divine commands! "Let this water undulate within
   itself; let this fire restrain its wrath; let this air wander into
   ether; and this earth be consolidated, and acquire motion! When I want
   to form man, I want matter, and have matter in the elements. I dwell
   with what I have formed. If you know me, the fire will be your slave."

   Such is the Word, such is the Instructor, the Creator of the world and
   of man: and of Himself, now the world's Instructor, by whose command we
   and the universe subsist, and await judgment. "For it is not he who
   brings a stealthy vocal word to men," as Bacchylidis says, "who shall
   be the Word of Wisdom;" but "the blameless, the pure, and faultless
   sons of God," according to Paul, "in the midst of a crooked and
   perverse generation, to shine as lights in the world." [1786]

   All that remains therefore now, in such a celebration of the Word as
   this, is that we address to the Word our prayer.

      Prayer to the Pædagogus.

   Be gracious, O Instructor, to us Thy children, Father, Charioteer of
   Israel, Son and Father, both in One, O Lord. Grant to us who obey Thy
   precepts, that we may perfect the likeness of the image, and with all
   our power know Him who is the good God and not a harsh judge. And do
   Thou Thyself cause that all of us who have our conversation in Thy
   peace, who have been translated into Thy commonwealth, having sailed
   tranquilly over the billows of sin, may be wafted in calm by Thy Holy
   Spirit, by the ineffable wisdom, by night and day to the perfect day;
   and giving thanks may praise, and praising thank the Alone Father and
   Son, Son and Father, the Son, Instructor and Teacher, with the Holy
   Spirit, all in One, in whom is all, for whom all is One, for whom is
   eternity, whose members we all are, whose glory the æons [1787] are;
   for the All-good, All-lovely, All-wise, All-just One. To whom be glory
   both now and for ever. Amen.

   And since the Instructor, by translating us into His Church, has united
   us to Himself, the teaching and all-surveying Word, it were right that,
   having got to this point, we should offer to the Lord the reward of due
   thanksgiving--praise suitable to His fair instruction.

    A Hymn to Christ the Saviour.

   Composed by St. Clement. [1788]

   I.


   Bridle of colts untamed,

   Over our wills presiding;

   Wing of unwandering birds,

   Our flight securely guiding.

   Rudder of youth unbending,

   Firm against adverse shock;

   Shepherd, with wisdom tending

   Lambs of the royal flock:

   Thy simple children bring

   In one, that they may sing

   In solemn lays

   Their hymns of praise

   With guileless lips to Christ their King.

   II.


   King of saints, almighty Word

   Of the Father highest Lord;

   Wisdom's head and chief;

   Assuagement of all grief;

   Lord of all time and space,

   Jesus, Saviour of our race;

   Shepherd, who dost us keep;

   Husbandman, who tillest,

   Bit to restrain us, Rudder

   To guide us as Thou willest;

   Of the all-holy flock celestial wing;

   Fisher of men, whom Thou to life dost bring;

   From evil sea of sin,

   And from the billowy strife,

   Gathering pure fishes in,

   Caught with sweet bait of life:

   Lead us, Shepherd of the sheep,

   Reason-gifted, holy One;

   King of youths, whom Thou dost keep,

   So that they pollution shun:

   Steps of Christ, celestial Way;

   Word eternal, Age unending;

   Life that never can decay;

   Fount of mercy, virtue-sending;

   Life august of those who raise

   Unto God their hymn of praise,

   Jesus Christ!

   III.


   Nourished by the milk of heaven,

   To our tender palates given;

   Milk of wisdom from the breast

   Of that bride of grace exprest;

   By a dewy spirit filled

   From fair Reason's breast distilled;

   Let us sucklings join to raise

   With pure lips our hymns of praise

   As our grateful offering,

   Clean and pure, to Christ our King.

   Let us, with hearts undefiled,

   Celebrate the mighty Child.

   We, Christ-born, the choir of peace;

   We, the people of His love,

   Let us sing, nor ever cease,

   To the God of peace above.

   We subjoin the following literal translation of the foregoing hymn:--

   Bridle of untamed colts, Wing of unwandering birds, sure Helm of babes,
   [1789] Shepherd of royal lambs, assemble Thy simple children to praise
   holily, to hymn guilelessly with innocent mouths, Christ the guide of
   children. O King of saints, all-subduing Word of the most high Father,
   Ruler of wisdom, Support of sorrows, that rejoicest in the ages, [1790]
   Jesus, Saviour of the human race, Shepherd, Husbandman, Helm, Bridle,
   Heavenly Wing of the all-holy flock, Fisher of men who are saved,
   catching the chaste fishes with sweet life from the hateful wave of a
   sea of vices,--Guide [us], Shepherd of rational sheep; guide unharmed
   children, O holy King, [1791] O footsteps of Christ, O heavenly way,
   perennial Word, immeasurable Age, Eternal Light, Fount of mercy,
   performer of virtue; noble [is the] life of those who hymn God, O
   Christ Jesus, heavenly milk of the sweet breasts of the graces of the
   Bride, pressed out of Thy wisdom. Babes nourished with tender mouths,
   filled with the dewy spirit of the rational pap, let us sing together
   simple praises, true hymns to Christ [our] King, holy fee for the
   teaching of life; let us sing in simplicity the powerful Child. O choir
   of peace, the Christ-begotten, O chaste people, let us sing together
   [1792] the God of peace. [1793]

      To the Pædagogus.


   Teacher, to Thee a chaplet I present,

   Woven of words culled from the spotless mead,

   Where Thou dost feed Thy flocks; like to the bee,

   That skilful worker, which from many a flower

   Gathers its treasures, that she may convey

   A luscious offering to the master's hand.

   Though but the least, I am Thy servant still,

   (Seemly is praise to Thee for Thy behests).

   O King, great Giver of good gifts to men,

   Lord of the good, Father, of all the Maker,

   Who heaven and heaven's adornment, by Thy word

   Divine fitly disposed, alone didst make;

   Who broughtest forth the sunshine and the day;

   Who didst appoint their courses to the stars,

   And how the earth and sea their place should keep;

   And when the seasons, in their circling course,

   Winter and summer, spring and autumn, each [1794]

   Should come, according to well-ordered plan;

   Out of a confused heap who didst create

   This ordered sphere, and from the shapeless mass

   Of matter didst the universe adorn;--

   Grant to me life, and be that life well spent,

   Thy grace enjoying; let me act and speak

   In all things as Thy Holy Scriptures teach; [1795]

   Thee and Thy co-eternal Word, All-wise,

   From Thee proceeding, ever may I praise;

   Give me nor poverty nor wealth, but what is meet,

   Father, in life, and then life's happy close. [1796]

   [1787] Aiones, "celestial spirits and angels."--Grabe, in a note on
   Bull's Defence of the Nicene Creed. [I wish a more definite reference
   had been furnished by the learned translator. Even Kaye's reference is
   not precise. Consulting Grabe's annotations in vain, I was then obliged
   to go through the foot-notes, where, at last (vol. v. part i. p. 246.),
   I found in comparative obscurity Grabe's language. It may be rendered:
   "These words I think should be thus construed--cujus gloria sunt
   soecula--whose glory are the heavenly spirits or angels. Concerning
   which signification of ton aionon, note what I have said among divers
   annotations on Irenæus, p. 32. ed. Benedict."]

   [1788] [Elucidation III.] The translator has done what he could to
   render this hymn literally. He has been obliged, however, to add
   somewhat to it in the way of expansion, for otherwise it would have
   been impossible to secure anything approaching the flow of English
   versification. The original is in many parts a mere string of epithets,
   which no ingenuity could render in rhymed verse without some additions.

   [1789] Or, "ships:" neon, instead of nepion, has been suggested as
   better sense and better metre.

   [1790] Or, "rejoicing in eternity."

   [1791] By altering the punctuation, we can translate thus: "Guide, O
   holy King, Thy children safely along the footsteps of Christ."

   [1792] The word used here is psalomen, originally signifying, "Let us
   celebrate on a stringed instrument." Whether it is so used here or not,
   may be matter of dispute.

   [1793] [The holy virgin of Nazareth is the author of the first
   Christian hymn, The Magnificat. It is a sequel to the psalms of her
   father David, and interprets them. To Clement of Alexandria belongs the
   praise of leading the choir of uninspired Christian poets, whom he thus
   might seem to invoke to carry on the strain through all time.]

   [1794] [The hymn suffixed to Thomson's Seasons might seem to have been
   suggested by this ancient example of praise to the Maker. But, to feel
   this hymn, we must reflect upon its superiority, in a moral point of
   view, to all the Attic Muse had ever produced before.]

   [1795] [The Scriptures are the rule of faith.]

   [1796] [Kaye's careful criticism of M. Barbeyrac's captious complains
   against Clement, are specially instructive. p. 109.]

  Elucidations.

      I

   (Pædagogue, book II. chap. 3, p. 247.)

   This fine paragraph is in many ways interesting. The tourist who has
   visited the catacombs, is familiar, among tokens of the first rude art
   of Christians, with relics of various articles, realizing this idea of
   Clement's, that even our furniture should be distinctively Christian.
   In Pompeii, one finds lamps and other vessels marked by heathenish
   devices, some of them gross and revolting. On the contrary, these
   Christian utensils bear the sacred monograms ChR, AO, or the figure of
   the fish, conveying to the user, by the letters of the Greek word for a
   fish (IChThUS), the initials of the words "Jesus Christ, Son of God,
   The Saviour." Often we have the anchor, the palm-branch, or the cross
   itself. But I never looked at one of those Christian lamps without
   imagining its owner, singing, as it was lighted, the eventide hymn (of
   which see Elucidation III.), and reciting probably, therewith, the
   text, "Let your loins be girded, and your lamps burning," etc. For a
   valuable elucidation of subjects illustrated by Christian art, see
   Testimony of the Catacombs, by the late Wharton B. Marriott (London,
   Hatchards, 1870).

      II.

   (Book iii. Going to Church. p. 290, supra.)

   Frequent references become necessary, at this point, to the
   ecclesiastical usages of the early Christians. These have been largely
   treated of by the great Anglican divines, whose works are recognised as
   part of the standard literature of Christendom; but the nature of this
   publication seems to impose on me the duty of choosing from external
   sources, rather than from authors who have been more or less associated
   with the controversies of our great "Anglo-Saxon" family. Happily the
   writings of the late Dr. Bunsen supply us with all that is requisite of
   this sort. In that very curious and characteristic medley, Hippolytus
   and His Age, he has gathered into a convenient form nearly every point
   which requires antiquarian elucidation, under the title of The Church
   and Home Book of the Ancient Christians. Its contents he professes to
   have rescued "from the rubbish in which they were enveloped for
   centuries, and disencumbered of the fraud and misunderstanding by which
   they are defaced." Now, while by no means satisfied with this work
   myself, it affords an interesting specimen of the conclusions to which
   an earnest and scholarly mind has been brought, in the course of
   original and industrious research. It is the more interesting, as
   illustrating a conviction, which he expresses elsewhere, that, in
   shaping "the Church of the future," all Christians must revert to these
   records of primitive antiquity, as of practical interest for our own
   times. The proverbial faults of its author are indeed conspicuous in
   this work, which, though the product of a mere inquirer, is presented
   to us with entire self-reliance, as if he were competent to pronounce
   upon all questions with something like pontifical infallibility. It is
   also greatly mixed up with his personal theories, which are always
   interesting, but rarely satisfactory to his readers. In spite of all
   this, he has brought together, in a condensed form, what is undoubtedly
   the result of patient investigation. It is the rather useful, because
   it is the work of a genuine disciple of Niebuhr, who doubts and
   questions at every step, and who always suspects a fraud. He is
   committed, by his religious persuasions, to no system whatever, with
   respect to such matters, and he professes to have produced a manual of
   Christian antiquity, entirely scientific; that is to say, wholly
   impartial, indifferent as to consequences, and following only the lead
   of truth and evidence. In my references to Bunsen, therefore, let it be
   understood, that, without accepting him as my own master, I yet wish to
   respect his opinion and to commend his performance to the candid
   investigation of others.

      III.

   The one ancient hymn, not strictly liturgical, which probably was not
   new even to Clement, and to which we have already made reference once
   or twice, is the following, which we give from Bunsen. He calls it "The
   Evening Hymn of the Greek Christians," but it was not confined to the
   Greeks any more than was the Greek of the Gospels and the Creeds. Its
   proper name is "The Eventide Hymn," or "The Hymn for the Lighting of
   the Lamps," and was doubtless uttered in the family at "candlelight,"
   as we say a grace before meat. It is thus rendered:--

      Hymn.


   Serene light of the Holy Glory

   Of the Father Everlasting,

   Jesus Christ:

   Having come to the setting of the sun,

   And seeing the evening light,

   We praise the Father and the Son,

   And the Holy Spirit of God.

   It behooveth to praise Thee,

   At all times with holy songs,

   Son of God, who hast given life;

   Therefore the world glorifieth Thee.

   The modern Italians, at sunset, recite the Ave Maria, which has been
   imposed upon them by mediæval Rome. Nothing but the coincidence of the
   hour reminds us of the ancient hymn which it has superseded; and a
   healthy mind, one would think, would note the contrast. This pure "hymn
   to Christ as God," and to the Godhead in unity, gives place to an act
   of worship addressed to the creature, more than to the Creator. One
   might indeed call this Ave Maria the eventide hymn of modern Italy; but
   the scatter-brain processes of Dr. Bunsen come out in the strange
   reversal of thought, by which he would throw back the utterly
   incongruous title of its Italian substitute upon a primitive hymn to
   the Trinity,--"the Ave-Maria hymn, as we might call it from the present
   Italian custom," etc. The strange confusion of ideas which constantly
   characterizes this author, whenever some association, however remote,
   strikes his fancy, is well illustrated by this instance. Let it serve
   as a caution in following his lead. See Hippolytus (vol. iii. pp. 68,
   138, etc.) and also Routh (Reliquiæ, vol. iii. pp. 515-520). Concerning
   the morning hymn, Gloria in Excelsis, which Dr. Bunsen gives from the
   Alexandrian ms., and to which reference is made in his Analecta
   Ante-Nicæna (iii. 86), see Warren's Celtic Liturgy (p. 197, and index
   references. Ed. Oxford, 1881).

      Chapter I.--Preface--The Author's Object--The Utility of Written
      Compositions. [1797]

   [Wants the beginning] .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  that you may read
   them under your hand, and may be able to preserve them. Whether written
   compositions are not to be left behind at all; or if they are, by whom?
   And if the former, what need there is for written compositions? and if
   the latter, is the composition of them to be assigned to earnest men,
   or the opposite? It were certainly ridiculous for one to disapprove of
   the writing of earnest men, and approve of those, who are not such,
   engaging in the work of composition. Theopompus and Timæus, who
   composed fables and slanders, and Epicurus the leader of atheism, and
   Hipponax and Archilochus, are to be allowed to write in their own
   shameful manner. But he who proclaims the truth is to be prevented from
   leaving behind him what is to benefit posterity. It is a good thing, I
   reckon, to leave to posterity good children. This is the case with
   children of our bodies. But words are the progeny of the soul. Hence we
   call those who have instructed us, fathers. Wisdom is a communicative
   and philanthropic thing. Accordingly, Solomon says, "My son, if thou
   receive the saying of my commandment, and hide it with thee, thine ear
   shall hear wisdom." [1798] He points out that the word that is sown is
   hidden in the soul of the learner, as in the earth, and this is
   spiritual planting. Wherefore also he adds, "And thou shalt apply thine
   heart to understanding, and apply it for the admonition of thy son."
   For soul, methinks, joined with soul, and spirit with spirit, in the
   sowing of the word, will make that which is sown grow and germinate.
   And every one who is instructed, is in respect of subjection the son of
   his instructor. "Son," says he, "forget not my laws." [1799]

   And if knowledge belong not to all (set an ass to the lyre, as the
   proverb goes), yet written compositions are for the many. "Swine, for
   instance, delight in dirt more than in clean water." "Wherefore," says
   the Lord, "I speak to them in parables: because seeing, they see not;
   and hearing, they hear not, and do not understand;" [1800] not as if
   the Lord caused the ignorance: for it were impious to think so. But He
   prophetically exposed this ignorance, that existed in them, and
   intimated that they would not understand the things spoken. And now the
   Saviour shows Himself, out of His abundance, dispensing goods to His
   servants according to the ability of the recipient, that they may
   augment them by exercising activity, and then returning to reckon with
   them; when, approving of those that had increased His money, those
   faithful in little, and commanding them to have the charge over many
   things, He bade them enter into the joy of the Lord. But to him who had
   hid the money, entrusted to him to be given out at interest, and had
   given it back as he had received it, without increase, He said, "Thou
   wicked and slothful servant, thou oughtest to have given my money to
   the bankers, and at my coming I should have received mine own."
   Wherefore the useless servant "shall be cast into outer darkness."
   [1801] "Thou, therefore, be strong," says Paul, "in the grace that is
   in Christ Jesus. And the things which thou hast heard of me among many
   witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to
   teach others also." [1802] And again: "Study to show thyself approved
   unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing
   the word of truth."

   If, then, both proclaim the Word--the one by writing, the other by
   speech--are not both then to be approved, making, as they do, faith
   active by love? It is by one's own fault that he does not choose what
   is best; God is free of blame. As to the point in hand, it is the
   business of some to lay out the word at interest, and of others to test
   it, and either choose it or not. And the judgment is determined within
   themselves. But there is that species of knowledge which is
   characteristic of the herald, and that which is, as it were,
   characteristic of a messenger, and it is serviceable in whatever way it
   operates, both by the hand and tongue. "For he that soweth to the
   Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. And let us not be
   weary in well-doing." [1803] On him who by Divine Providence meets in
   with it, it confers the very highest advantages,--the beginning of
   faith, readiness for adopting a right mode of life, the impulse towards
   the truth, a movement of inquiry, a trace of knowledge; in a word, it
   gives the means of salvation. And those who have been rightly reared in
   the words of truth, and received provision for eternal life, wing their
   way to heaven. Most admirably, therefore, the apostle says, "In
   everything approving ourselves as the servants of God; as poor, and yet
   making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things. Our
   mouth is opened to you." [1804] "I charge thee," he says, writing to
   Timothy, "before God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou
   observe these things, without preferring one before another, doing
   nothing by partiality." [1805]

   Both must therefore test themselves: the one, if he is qualified to
   speak and leave behind him written records; the other, if he is in a
   right state to hear and read: as also some in the dispensation of the
   Eucharist, according to [1806] custom enjoin that each one of the
   people individually should take his part. One's own conscience is best
   for choosing accurately or shunning. And its firm foundation is a right
   life, with suitable instruction. But the imitation of those who have
   already been proved, and who have led correct lives, is most excellent
   for the understanding and practice of the commandments. "So that
   whosoever shall eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord unworthily,
   shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man
   examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup."
   [1807] It therefore follows, that every one of those who undertake to
   promote the good of their neighbours, ought to consider whether he has
   betaken himself to teaching rashly and out of rivalry to any; if his
   communication of the word is out of vainglory; if the the only reward
   he reaps is the salvation of those who hear, and if he speaks not in
   order to win favour: if so, he who speaks by writings escapes the
   reproach of mercenary motives. "For neither at any time used we
   flattering words, as ye know," says the apostle, "nor a cloak of
   covetousness. God is witness. Nor of men sought we glory, neither of
   you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome as the
   apostles of Christ. But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse
   cherisheth her children." [1808]

   In the same way, therefore, those who take part in the divine words,
   ought to guard against betaking themselves to this, as they would to
   the building of cities, to examine them out of curiosity; that they do
   not come to the task for the sake of receiving worldly things, having
   ascertained that they who are consecrated to Christ are given to
   communicate the necessaries of life. But let such be dismissed as
   hypocrites. But if any one wishes not to seem, but to be righteous, to
   him it belongs to know the things which are best. If, then, "the
   harvest is plenteous, but the labourers few," it is incumbent on us "to
   pray" that there may be as great abundance of labourers as possible.
   [1809]

   But the husbandry is twofold,--the one unwritten, and the other
   written. And in whatever way the Lord's labourer sow the good wheat,
   and grow and reap the ears, he shall appear a truly divine husbandman.
   "Labour," says the Lord, "not for the meat which perisheth, but for
   that which endureth to everlasting life." [1810] And nutriment is
   received both by bread and by words. And truly "blessed are the
   peace-makers," [1811] who instructing those who are at war in their
   life and errors here, lead them back to the peace which is in the Word,
   and nourish for the life which is according to God, by the distribution
   of the bread, those "that hunger after righteousness." For each soul
   has its own proper nutriment; some growing by knowledge and science,
   and others feeding on the Hellenic philosophy, the whole of which, like
   nuts, is not eatable. "And he that planteth and he that watereth,"
   "being ministers" of Him "that gives the increase, are one" in the
   ministry. "But every one shall receive his own reward, according to his
   own work. For we are God's husbandmen, God's husbandry. Ye are God's
   building," [1812] according to the apostle. Wherefore the hearers are
   not permitted to apply the test of comparison. Nor is the word, given
   for investigation, to be committed to those who have been reared in the
   arts of all kinds of words, and in the power of inflated attempts at
   proof; whose minds are already pre-occupied, and have not been
   previously emptied. But whoever chooses to banquet on faith, is
   stedfast for the reception of the divine words, having acquired already
   faith as a power of judging, according to reason. Hence ensues to him
   persuasion in abundance. And this was the meaning of that saying of
   prophecy, "If ye believe not, neither shall ye understand." [1813] "As,
   then, we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to the
   household of faith." [1814] And let each of these, according to the
   blessed David, sing, giving thanks. "Thou shalt sprinkle me with
   hyssop, and I shall be cleansed. Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be
   whiter than the snow. Thou shalt make me to hear gladness and joy, and
   the bones which have been humbled shall rejoice. Turn Thy face from my
   sins. Blot out mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and
   renew a right spirit in my inward parts. Cast me not away from Thy
   face, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of
   Thy salvation, and establish me with Thy princely spirit." [1815]

   He who addresses those who are present before him, both tests them by
   time, and judges by his judgment, and from the others distinguishes him
   who can hear; watching the words, the manners, the habits, the life,
   the motions, the attitudes, the look, the voice; the road, the rock,
   the beaten path, the fruitful land, the wooded region, the fertile and
   fair and cultivated spot, that is able to multiply the seed. But he
   that speaks through books, consecrates himself before God, crying in
   writing thus: Not for gain, not for vainglory, not to be vanquished by
   partiality, nor enslaved by fear nor elated by pleasure; but only to
   reap the salvation of those who read, which he does, not at present
   participate in, but awaiting in expectation the recompense which will
   certainly be rendered by Him, who has promised to bestow on the
   labourers the reward that is meet. But he who is enrolled in the number
   of men [1816] ought not to desire recompense. For he that vaunts his
   good services, receives glory as his reward. And he who does any duty
   for the sake of recompense, is he not held fast in the custom of the
   world, either as one who has done well, hastening to receive a reward,
   or as an evil-doer avoiding retribution? We must, as far as we can,
   imitate the Lord. And he will do so, who complies with the will of God,
   receiving freely, giving freely, and receiving as a worthy reward the
   citizenship itself. "The hire of an harlot shall not come into the
   sanctuary," it is said: accordingly it was forbidden to bring to the
   altar the price of a dog. And in whomsoever the eye of the soul has
   been blinded by ill-nurture and teaching, let him advance to the true
   light, to the truth, which shows by writing the things that are
   unwritten. "Ye that thirst, go to the waters," [1817] says Esaias. And
   "drink water from thine own vessels," [1818] Solomon exhorts.
   Accordingly in "The Laws," the philosopher who learned from the
   Hebrews, Plato, commands husbandmen not to irrigate or take water from
   others, until they have first dug down in their own ground to what is
   called the virgin soil, and found it dry. For it is right to supply
   want, but it is not well to support laziness. For Pythagoras said that,
   "although it be agreeable to reason to take a share of a burden, it is
   not a duty to take it away."

   Now the Scripture kindles the living spark of the soul, and directs the
   eye suitably for contemplation; perchance inserting something, as the
   husbandman when he ingrafts, but, according to the opinion of the
   divine apostle, exciting what is in the soul. "For there are certainly
   among us many weak and sickly, and many sleep. But if we judge
   ourselves, we shall not be judged." [1819] Now this work of mine in
   writing is not artfully constructed for display; but my memoranda are
   stored up against old age, as a remedy against forgetfulness, truly an
   image and outline of those vigorous and animated discourses which I was
   privileged to hear, and of blessed and truly remarkable men.

   Of these the one, in Greece, an Ionic; [1820] the other in Magna
   Græcia: the first of these from Coele-Syria, the second from Egypt, and
   others in the East. The one was born in the land of Assyria, and the
   other a Hebrew in Palestine.

   When I came upon the last [1821] (he was the first in power), having
   tracked him out concealed in Egypt, I found rest. He, the true, the
   Sicilian bee, gathering the spoil of the flowers of the prophetic and
   apostolic meadow, engendered in the souls of his hearers a deathless
   element of knowledge.

   Well, they preserving the tradition of the blessed doctrine derived
   directly from the holy apostles, Peter, James, John, and Paul, the sons
   receiving it from the father (but few were like the fathers), came by
   God's will to us also to deposit those ancestral and apostolic seeds.
   And well I know that they will exult; I do not mean delighted with this
   tribute, but solely on account of the preservation of the truth,
   according as they delivered it. For such a sketch as this, will, I
   think, be agreeable to a soul desirous of preserving from escape the
   blessed tradition. [1822] "In a man who loves wisdom the father will be
   glad." [1823] Wells, when pumped out, yield purer water; and that of
   which no one partakes, turns to putrefaction. Use keeps steel brighter,
   but disuse produces rust in it. For, in a word, exercise produces a
   healthy condition both in souls and bodies. "No one lighteth a candle,
   and putteth it under a bushel, but upon a candlestick, that it may give
   light to those who are regarded worthy of the feast." [1824] For what
   is the use of wisdom, if it makes not him who can hear it wise? For
   still the Saviour saves, "and always works, as He sees the Father."
   [1825] For by teaching, one learns more; and in speaking, one is often
   a hearer along with his audience. For the teacher of him who speaks and
   of him who hears is one--who waters both the mind and the word. Thus
   the Lord did not hinder from doing good while keeping the Sabbath;
   [1826] but allowed us to communicate of those divine mysteries, and of
   that holy light, to those who are able to receive them. He did not
   certainly disclose to the many what did not belong to the many; but to
   the few to whom He knew that they belonged, who were capable of
   receiving and being moulded according to them. But secret things are
   entrusted to speech, not to writing, as is the case with God. [1827]

   And if one say that it is written, "There is nothing secret which shall
   not be revealed, nor hidden which shall not be disclosed," [1828] let
   him also hear from us, that to him who hears secretly, even what is
   secret shall be manifested. This is what was predicted by this oracle.
   And to him who is able secretly to observe what is delivered to him,
   that which is veiled shall be disclosed as truth; and what is hidden to
   the many, shall appear manifest to the few. For why do not all know the
   truth? why is not righteousness loved, if righteousness belongs to all?
   But the mysteries are delivered mystically, that what is spoken may be
   in the mouth of the speaker; rather not in his voice, but in his
   understanding. "God gave to the Church, some apostles, and some
   prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the
   perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
   edifying of the body of Christ." [1829]

   The writing of these memoranda of mine, I well know, is weak when
   compared with that spirit, full of grace, which I was privileged to
   hear. [1830] But it will be an image to recall the archetype to him who
   was struck with the thyrsus. For "speak," it is said, "to a wise man,
   and he will grow wiser; and to him that hath, and there shall be added
   to him." And we profess not to explain secret things sufficiently--far
   from it--but only to recall them to memory, whether we have forgot
   aught, or whether for the purpose of not forgetting. Many things, I
   well know, have escaped us, through length of time, that have dropped
   away unwritten. Whence, to aid the weakness of my memory, and provide
   for myself a salutary help to my recollection in a systematic
   arrangement of chapters, I necessarily make use of this form. There are
   then some things of which we have no recollection; for the power that
   was in the blessed men was great. [1831] There are also some things
   which remained unnoted long, which have now escaped; and others which
   are effaced, having faded away in the mind itself, since such a task is
   not easy to those not experienced; these I revive in my commentaries.
   Some things I purposely omit, in the exercise of a wise selection,
   afraid to write what I guarded against speaking: not grudging--for that
   were wrong--but fearing for my readers, lest they should stumble by
   taking them in a wrong sense; and, as the proverb says, we should be
   found "reaching a sword to a child." For it is impossible that what has
   been written should not escape, although remaining unpublished by me.
   But being always revolved, using the one only voice, that of writing,
   they answer nothing to him that makes inquiries beyond what is written;
   for they require of necessity the aid of some one, either of him who
   wrote, or of some one else who has walked in his footsteps. Some things
   my treatise will hint; on some it will linger; some it will merely
   mention. It will try to speak imperceptibly, to exhibit secretly, and
   to demonstrate silently. The dogmas taught by remarkable sects will be
   adduced; and to these will be opposed all that ought to be premised in
   accordance with the profoundest contemplation of the knowledge, which,
   as we proceed to the renowned and venerable canon of tradition, from
   the creation of the world, [1832] will advance to our view; setting
   before us what according to natural contemplation necessarily has to be
   treated of beforehand, and clearing off what stands in the way of this
   arrangement. So that we may have our ears ready for the reception of
   the tradition of true knowledge; the soil being previously cleared of
   the thorns and of every weed by the husbandman, in order to the
   planting of the vine. For there is a contest, and the prelude to the
   contest; and there are some mysteries before other mysteries.

   Our book will not shrink from making use of what is best in philosophy
   and other preparatory instruction. "For not only for the Hebrews and
   those that are under the law," according to the apostle, "is it right
   to become a Jew, but also a Greek for the sake of the Greeks, that we
   may gain all." [1833] Also in the Epistle to the Colossians he writes,
   "Admonishing every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we
   may present every man perfect in Christ." [1834] The nicety of
   speculation, too, suits the sketch presented in my commentaries. In
   this respect the resources of learning are like a relish mixed with the
   food of an athlete, who is not indulging in luxury, but entertains a
   noble desire for distinction.

   By music we harmoniously relax the excessive tension of gravity. And as
   those who wish to address the people, do so often by the herald, that
   what is said may be better heard; so also in this case. For we have the
   word, that was spoken to many, before the common tradition. Wherefore
   we must set forth the opinions and utterances which cried individually
   to them, by which those who hear shall more readily turn.

   And, in truth, to speak briefly: Among many small pearls there is the
   one; and in a great take of fish there is the beauty-fish; and by time
   and toil truth will gleam forth, if a good helper is at hand. For most
   benefits are supplied, from God, through men. All of us who make use of
   our eyes see what is presented before them. But some look at objects
   for one reason, others for another. For instance, the cook and the
   shepherd do not survey the sheep similarly: for the one examines it if
   it be fat; the other watches to see if it be of good breed. Let a man
   milk the sheep's milk if he need sustenance: let him shear the wool if
   he need clothing. And in this way let me produce the fruit of the Greek
   erudition. [1835]

   For I do not imagine that any composition can be so fortunate as that
   no one will speak against it. But that is to be regarded as in
   accordance with reason, which nobody speaks against, with reason. And
   that course of action and choice is to be approved, not which is
   faultless, but which no one rationally finds fault with. For it does
   not follow, that if a man accomplishes anything not purposely, he does
   it through force of circumstances. But he will do it, managing it by
   wisdom divinely given, and in accommodation to circumstances. For it is
   not he who has virtue that needs the way to virtue, any more than he,
   that is strong, needs recovery. For, like farmers who irrigate the land
   beforehand, so we also water with the liquid stream of Greek learning
   what in it is earthy; so that it may receive the spiritual seed cast
   into it, and may be capable of easily nourishing it. The Stromata will
   contain the truth mixed up in the dogmas of philosophy, or rather
   covered over and hidden, as the edible part of the nut in the shell.
   For, in my opinion, it is fitting that the seeds of truth be kept for
   the husbandmen of faith, and no others. I am not oblivious of what is
   babbled by some, who in their ignorance are frightened at every noise,
   and say that we ought to occupy ourselves with what is most necessary,
   and which contains the faith; and that we should pass over what is
   beyond and superfluous, which wears out and detains us to no purpose,
   in things which conduce nothing to the great end. Others think that
   philosophy was introduced into life by an evil influence, for the ruin
   of men, by an evil inventor. But I shall show, throughout the whole of
   these Stromata, that evil has an evil nature, and can never turn out
   the producer of aught that is good; indicating that philosophy is in a
   sense a work of Divine Providence. [1836]

      Chapter II.--Objection to the Number of Extracts from Philosophical
      Writings in These Books Anticipated and Answered.

   In reference to these commentaries, which contain as the exigencies of
   the case demand, the Hellenic opinions, I say thus much to those who
   are fond of finding fault. First, even if philosophy were useless, if
   the demonstration of its uselessness does good, it is yet useful. Then
   those cannot condemn the Greeks, who have only a mere hearsay knowledge
   of their opinions, and have not entered into a minute investigation in
   each department, in order to acquaintance with them. For the
   refutation, which is based on experience, is entirely trustworthy. For
   the knowledge of what is condemned is found the most complete
   demonstration. Many things, then, though not contributing to the final
   result, equip the artist. And otherwise erudition commends him, who
   sets forth the most essential doctrines so as to produce persuasion in
   his hearers, engendering admiration in those who are taught, and leads
   them to the truth. And such persuasion is convincing, by which those
   that love learning admit the truth; so that philosophy does not ruin
   life by being the originator of false practices and base deeds,
   although some have calumniated it, though it be the clear image of
   truth, a divine gift to the Greeks; [1837] nor does it drag us away
   from the faith, as if we were bewitched by some delusive art, but
   rather, so to speak, by the use of an ampler circuit, obtains a common
   exercise demonstrative of the faith. Further, the juxtaposition of
   doctrines, by comparison, saves the truth, from which follows
   knowledge.

   Philosophy came into existence, not on its own account, but for the
   advantages reaped by us from knowledge, we receiving a firm persuasion
   of true perception, through the knowledge of things comprehended by the
   mind. For I do not mention that the Stromata, forming a body of varied
   erudition, wish artfully to conceal the seeds of knowledge. As, then,
   he who is fond of hunting captures the game after seeking, tracking,
   scenting, hunting it down with dogs; so truth, when sought and got with
   toil, appears a delicious [1838] thing. Why, then, you will ask, did
   you think it fit that such an arrangement should be adopted in your
   memoranda? Because there is great danger in divulging the secret of the
   true philosophy to those, whose delight it is unsparingly to speak
   against everything, not justly; and who shout forth all kinds of names
   and words indecorously, deceiving themselves and beguiling those who
   adhere to them. "For the Hebrews seek signs," as the apostle says, "and
   the Greeks seek after wisdom." [1839]

      Chapter III.--Against the Sophists.

   There is a great crowd of this description: some of them, enslaved to
   pleasures and willing to disbelieve, laugh at the truth which is worthy
   of all reverence, making sport of its barbarousness. Some others,
   exalting themselves, endeavour to discover calumnious objections to our
   words, furnishing captious questions, hunters out of paltry sayings,
   practicers of miserable artifices, wranglers, dealers in knotty points,
   as that Abderite says:--


   "For mortals' tongues are glib, and on them are many speeches;

   And a wide range for words of all sorts in this place and that."

   And--


   "Of whatever sort the word you have spoken, of the same sort you must
   hear."

   Inflated with this art of theirs, the wretched Sophists, babbling away
   in their own jargon; toiling their whole life about the division of
   names and the nature of the composition and conjunction of sentences,
   show themselves greater chatterers than turtle-doves; scratching and
   tickling, not in a manly way, in my opinion, the ears of those who wish
   to be tickled.


   "A river of silly words--not a dropping;"

   just as in old shoes, when all the rest is worn and is falling to
   pieces, and the tongue alone remains. The Athenian Solon most
   excellently enlarges, and writes:--


   "Look to the tongue, and to the words of the glozing man,

   But you look on no work that has been done;

   But each one of you walks in the steps of a fox,

   And in all of you is an empty mind."

   This, I think, is signified by the utterance of the Saviour, "The foxes
   have holes, but the Son of man hath not where to lay His head." [1840]
   For on the believer alone, who is separated entirely from the rest, who
   by the Scripture are called wild beasts, rests the head of the
   universe, the kind and gentle Word, "who taketh the wise in their own
   craftiness. For the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they
   are vain;" [1841] the Scripture calling those the wise (sophous) who
   are skilled in words and arts, sophists (sophistas). Whence the Greeks
   also applied the denominative appellation of wise and sophists (sophoi,
   sophistai) to those who were versed in anything Cratinus accordingly,
   having in the Archilochii enumerated the poets, said:--


   "Such a hive of sophists have ye examined."

   And similarly Iophon, the comic poet, in Flute-playing Satyrs, says:--


   "For there entered

   A band of sophists, all equipped."

   Of these and the like, who devote their attention to empty words, the
   divine Scripture most excellently says, "I will destroy the wisdom of
   the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."

      Chapter IV.--Human Arts as Well as Divine Knowledge Proceed from God.

   Homer calls an artificer wise; and of Margites, if that is his work, he
   thus writes:--


   "Him, then, the Gods made neither a delver nor a ploughman,

   Nor in any other respect wise; but he missed every art."

   Hesiod further said the musician Linus was "skilled in all manner of
   wisdom;" and does not hesitate to call a mariner wise, seeing he
   writes:--


   "Having no wisdom in navigation."

   And Daniel the prophet says, "The mystery which the king asks, it is
   not in the power of the wise, the Magi, the diviners, the Gazarenes, to
   tell the king; but it is God in heaven who revealeth it." [1843]

   Here he terms the Babylonians wise. And that Scripture calls every
   secular science or art by the one name wisdom (there are other arts and
   sciences invented over and above by human reason), and that artistic
   and skilful invention is from God, will be clear if we adduce the
   following statement: "And the Lord spake to Moses, See, I have called
   Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Or, of the tribe of Judah; and I
   have filled him with the divine spirit of wisdom, and understanding,
   and knowledge, to devise and to execute in all manner of work, to work
   gold, and silver, and brass, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and in
   working stone work, and in the art of working wood," and even to "all
   works." [1844] And then He adds the general reason, "And to every
   understanding heart I have given understanding;" [1845] that is, to
   every one capable of acquiring it by pains and exercise. And again, it
   is written expressly in the name of the Lord: "And speak thou to all
   that are wise in mind, whom I have filled with the spirit of
   perception." [1846]

   Those who are wise in mind have a certain attribute of nature peculiar
   to themselves; and they who have shown themselves capable, receive from
   the Supreme Wisdom a spirit of perception in double measure. For those
   who practice the common arts, are in what pertains to the senses highly
   gifted: in hearing, he who is commonly called a musician; in touch, he
   who moulds clay; in voice the singer, in smell the perfumer, in sight
   the engraver of devices on seals. Those also that are occupied in
   instruction, train the sensibility according to which the poets are
   susceptible to the influence of measure; the sophists apprehend
   expression; the dialecticians, syllogisms; and the philosophers are
   capable of the contemplation of which themselves are the objects. For
   sensibility finds and invents; since it persuasively exhorts to
   application. And practice will increase the application which has
   knowledge for its end. With reason, therefore, the apostle has called
   the wisdom of God "manifold," and which has manifested its power "in
   many departments and in many modes" [1847] --by art, by knowledge, by
   faith, by prophecy--for our benefit. "For all wisdom is from the Lord,
   and is with Him for ever," as says the wisdom of Jesus. [1848]

   "For if thou call on wisdom and knowledge with a loud voice, and seek
   it as treasures of silver, and eagerly track it out, thou shalt
   understand godliness and find divine knowledge." [1849] The prophet
   says this in contradiction to the knowledge according to philosophy,
   which teaches us to investigate in a magnanimous and noble manner, for
   our progress in piety. He opposes, therefore, to it the knowledge which
   is occupied with piety, when referring to knowledge, when he speaks as
   follows: "For God gives wisdom out of His own mouth, and knowledge
   along with understanding, and treasures up help for the righteous." For
   to those who have been justified [1850] by philosophy, the knowledge
   which leads to piety is laid up as a help.

      Chapter V.--Philosophy the Handmaid of Theology.

   Accordingly, before the advent of the Lord, philosophy was necessary to
   the Greeks for righteousness. [1851] And now it becomes conducive to
   piety; being a kind of preparatory training to those who attain to
   faith through demonstration. "For thy foot," it is said, "will not
   stumble, if thou refer what is good, whether belonging to the Greeks or
   to us, to Providence." [1852] For God is the cause of all good things;
   but of some primarily, as of the Old and the New Testament; and of
   others by consequence, as philosophy. Perchance, too, philosophy was
   given to the Greeks directly and primarily, till the Lord should call
   the Greeks. For this was a schoolmaster to bring "the Hellenic mind,"
   as the law, the Hebrews, "to Christ." [1853] Philosophy, therefore, was
   a preparation, paving the way for him who is perfected in Christ.
   [1854]

   "Now," says Solomon, "defend wisdom, and it will exalt thee, and it
   will shield thee with a crown of pleasure." [1855] For when thou hast
   strengthened wisdom with a cope by philosophy, and with right
   expenditure, thou wilt preserve it unassailable by sophists. The way of
   truth is therefore one. But into it, as into a perennial river, streams
   flow from all sides. It has been therefore said by inspiration: "Hear,
   my son, and receive my words; that thine may be the many ways of life.
   For I teach thee the ways of wisdom; that the fountains fail thee not,"
   [1856] which gush forth from the earth itself. Not only did He
   enumerate several ways of salvation for any one righteous man, but He
   added many other ways of many righteous, speaking thus: "The paths of
   the righteous shine like the light." [1857] The commandments and the
   modes of preparatory training are to be regarded as the ways and
   appliances of life.

   "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy children, as
   a hen her chickens!" [1858] And Jerusalem is, when interpreted, "a
   vision of peace." He therefore shows prophetically, that those who
   peacefully contemplate sacred things are in manifold ways trained to
   their calling. What then? He "would," and could not. How often, and
   where? Twice; by the prophets, and by the advent. The expression, then,
   "How often," shows wisdom to be manifold; every mode of quantity and
   quality, it by all means saves some, both in time and in eternity. "For
   the Spirit of the Lord fills the earth." [1859] And if any should
   violently say that the reference is to the Hellenic culture, when it is
   said, "Give not heed to an evil woman; for honey drops from the lips of
   a harlot," let him hear what follows: "who lubricates thy throat for
   the time." But philosophy does not flatter. Who, then, does He allude
   to as having committed fornication? He adds expressly, "For the feet of
   folly lead those who use her, after death, to Hades. But her steps are
   not supported." Therefore remove thy way far from silly pleasure.
   "Stand not at the doors of her house, that thou yield not thy life to
   others." And He testifies, "Then shall thou repent in old age, when the
   flesh of thy body is consumed." For this is the end of foolish
   pleasure. Such, indeed, is the case. And when He says, "Be not much
   with a strange woman," [1860] He admonishes us to use indeed, but not
   to linger and spend time with, secular culture. For what was bestowed
   on each generation advantageously, and at seasonable times, is a
   preliminary training for the word of the Lord. "For already some men,
   ensnared by the charms of handmaidens, have despised their consort
   philosophy, and have grown old, some of them in music, some in
   geometry, others in grammar, the most in rhetoric." [1861] "But as the
   encyclical branches of study contribute to philosophy, which is their
   mistress; so also philosophy itself co-operates for the acquisition of
   wisdom. For philosophy is the study of wisdom, and wisdom is the
   knowledge of things divine and human; and their causes." Wisdom is
   therefore queen of philosophy, as philosophy is of preparatory culture.
   For if philosophy "professes control of the tongue, and the belly, and
   the parts below the belly, it is to be chosen on its own account. But
   it appears more worthy of respect and pre-eminence, if cultivated for
   the honour and knowledge of God." [1862] And Scripture will afford a
   testimony to what has been said in what follows. Sarah was at one time
   barren, being Abraham's wife. Sarah having no child, assigned her maid,
   by name Hagar, the Egyptian, to Abraham, in order to get children.
   Wisdom, therefore, who dwells with the man of faith (and Abraham was
   reckoned faithful and righteous), was still barren and without child in
   that generation, not having brought forth to Abraham aught allied to
   virtue. And she, as was proper, thought that he, being now in the time
   of progress, should have intercourse with secular culture first (by
   Egyptian the world is designated figuratively); and afterwards should
   approach to her according to divine providence, and beget Isaac."
   [1863]

   And Philo interprets Hagar to mean "sojourning." [1864] For it is said
   in connection with this, "Be not much with a strange woman." [1865]
   Sarah he interprets to mean "my princedom." He, then, who has received
   previous training is at liberty to approach to wisdom, which is
   supreme, from which grows up the race of Israel. These things show that
   that wisdom can be acquired through instruction, to which Abraham
   attained, passing from the contemplation of heavenly things to the
   faith and righteousness which are according to God. And Isaac is shown
   to mean "self-taught;" wherefore also he is discovered to be a type of
   Christ. He was the husband of one wife Rebecca, which they translate
   "Patience." And Jacob is said to have consorted with several, his name
   being interpreted "Exerciser." And exercises are engaged in by means of
   many and various dogmas. Whence, also, he who is really "endowed with
   the power of seeing" is called Israel, [1866] having much experience,
   and being fit for exercise.

   Something else may also have been shown by the three patriarchs,
   namely, that the sure seal of knowledge is composed of nature, of
   education, and exercise.

   You may have also another image of what has been said, in Thamar
   sitting by the way, and presenting the appearance of a harlot, on whom
   the studious Judas (whose name is interpreted "powerful"), who left
   nothing unexamined and uninvestigated, looked; and turned aside to her,
   preserving his profession towards God. Wherefore also, when Sarah was
   jealous at Hagar being preferred to her, Abraham, as choosing only what
   was profitable in secular philosophy, said, "Behold, thy maid is in
   thine hands: deal with her as it pleases thee;" [1867] manifestly
   meaning, "I embrace secular culture as youthful, and a handmaid; but
   thy knowledge I honour and reverence as true wife." And Sarah afflicted
   her; which is equivalent to corrected and admonished her. It has
   therefore been well said, "My son, despise not thou the correction of
   God; nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him. For whom the Lord loveth
   He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth." [1868] And
   the foresaid Scriptures, when examined in other places, will be seen to
   exhibit other mysteries. We merely therefore assert here, that
   philosophy is characterized by investigation into truth and the nature
   of things (this is the truth of which the Lord Himself said, "I am the
   truth" [1869] ); and that, again, the preparatory training for rest in
   Christ exercises the mind, rouses the intelligence, and begets an
   inquiring shrewdness, by means of the true philosophy, which the
   initiated possess, having found it, or rather received it, from the
   truth itself.

      Chapter VI.--The Benefit of Culture.

   The readiness acquired by previous training conduces much to the
   perception of such things as are requisite; but those things which can
   be perceived only by mind are the special exercise for the mind. And
   their nature is triple according as we consider their quantity, their
   magnitude, and what can be predicated of them. For the discourse which
   consists of demonstrations, implants in the spirit of him who follows
   it, clear faith; so that he cannot conceive of that which is
   demonstrated being different; and so it does not allow us to succumb to
   those who assail us by fraud. In such studies, therefore, the soul is
   purged from sensible things, and is excited, so as to be able to see
   truth distinctly. For nutriment, and the training which is maintained
   gentle, make noble natures; and noble natures, when they have received
   such training, become still better than before both in other respects,
   but especially in productiveness, as is the case with the other
   creatures. Wherefore it is said, "Go to the ant, thou sluggard, and
   become wiser than it, which provideth much and, varied food in the
   harvest against the inclemency of winter." [1870] Or go to the bee, and
   learn how laborious she is; for she, feeding on the whole meadow,
   produces one honey-comb. And if "thou prayest in the closet," as the
   Lord taught, "to worship in spirit," [1871] thy management will no
   longer be solely occupied about the house, but also about the soul,
   what must be bestowed on it, and how, and how much; and what must be
   laid aside and treasured up in it; and when it ought to be produced,
   and to whom. For it is not by nature, but by learning, that people
   become noble and good, as people also become physicians and pilots. We
   all in common, for example, see the vine and the horse. But the
   husbandman will know if the vine be good or bad at fruit-bearing; and
   the horseman will easily distinguish between the spiritless and the
   swift animal. But that some are naturally predisposed to virtue above
   others, certain pursuits of those, who are so naturally predisposed
   above others, show. But that perfection in virtue is not the exclusive
   property of those, whose natures are better, is proved, since also
   those who by nature are ill-disposed towards virtue, in obtaining
   suitable training, for the most part attain to excellence; and, on the
   other hand, those whose natural dispositions are apt, become evil
   through neglect.

   Again, God has created us naturally social and just; whence justice
   must not be said to take its rise from implantation alone. But the good
   imparted by creation is to be conceived of as excited by the
   commandment; the soul being trained to be willing to select what is
   noblest.

   But as we say that a man can be a believer without learning, [1872] so
   also we assert that it is impossible for a man without learning to
   comprehend the things which are declared in the faith. But to adopt
   what is well said, and not to adopt the reverse, is caused not simply
   by faith, but by faith combined with knowledge. But if ignorance is
   want of training and of instruction, then teaching produces knowledge
   of divine and human things. But just as it is possible to live rightly
   in penury of this world's good things, so also in abundance. And we
   avow, that at once with more ease and more speed will one attain to
   virtue through previous training. But it is not such as to be
   unattainable without it; but it is attainable only when they have
   learned, and have had their senses exercised. [1873] "For hatred," says
   Solomon, "raises strife, but instruction guardeth the ways of life;"
   [1874] in such a way that we are not deceived nor deluded by those who
   are practiced in base arts for the injury of those who hear. "But
   instruction wanders reproachless," [1875] it is said. We must be
   conversant with the art of reasoning, for the purpose of confuting the
   deceitful opinions of the sophists. Well and felicitously, therefore,
   does Anaxarchus write in his book respecting "kingly rule:" "Erudition
   benefits greatly and hurts greatly him who possesses it; it helps him
   who is worthy, and injures him who utters readily every word, and
   before the whole people. It is necessary to know the measure of time.
   For this is the end of wisdom. And those who sing at the doors, even if
   they sing skilfully, are not reckoned wise, but have the reputation of
   folly." And Hesiod:--


   "Of the Muses, who make a man loquacious, divine, vocal."

   For him who is fluent in words he calls loquacious; and him who is
   clever, vocal; and "divine," him who is skilled, a philosopher, and
   acquainted with the truth.

      Chapter VII.--The Eclectic Philosophy Paves the Way for Divine Virtue.

   The Greek preparatory culture, therefore, with philosophy itself, is
   shown to have come down from God to men, not with a definite direction
   but in the way in which showers fall down on the good land, and on the
   dunghill, and on the houses. And similarly both the grass and the wheat
   sprout; and the figs and any other reckless trees grow on sepulchres.
   And things that grow, appear as a type of truths. For they enjoy the
   same influence of the rain. But they have not the same grace as those
   which spring up in rich soil, inasmuch as they are withered or plucked
   up. And here we are aided by the parable of the sower, which the Lord
   interpreted. For the husbandman of the soil which is among men is one;
   He who from the beginning, from the foundation of the world, sowed
   nutritious seeds; He who in each age rained down the Lord, the Word.
   But the times and places which received [such gifts], created the
   differences which exist. Further, the husbandman sows not only wheat
   (of which there are many varieties), but also other seeds--barley, and
   beans, and peas, and vetches, and vegetable and flower seeds. And to
   the same husbandry belongs both planting and the operations necessary
   in the nurseries, and gardens, and orchards, and the planning and
   rearing of all sorts of trees.

   In like manner, not only the care of sheep, but the care of herds, and
   breeding of horses, and dogs, and bee-craft, all arts, and to speak
   comprehensively, the care of flocks and the rearing of animals, differ
   from each other more or less, but are all useful for life. And
   philosophy--I do not mean the Stoic, or the Platonic, or the Epicurean,
   or the Aristotelian, but whatever has been well said by each of those
   sects, which teach righteousness along with a science pervaded by
   piety,--this eclectic whole I call philosophy. [1876] But such
   conclusions of human reasonings, as men have cut away and falsified, I
   would never call divine.

   And now we must look also at this, that if ever those who know not how
   to do well, live well; [1877] for they have lighted on well-doing.
   Some, too, have aimed well at the word of truth through understanding.
   "But Abraham was not justified by works, but by faith." [1878] It is
   therefore of no advantage to them after the end of life, even if they
   do good works now, if they have not faith. Wherefore also the
   Scriptures [1879] were translated into the language of the Greeks, in
   order that they might never be able to allege the excuse of ignorance,
   inasmuch as they are able to hear also what we have in our hands, if
   they only wish. One speaks in one way of the truth, in another way the
   truth interprets itself. The guessing at truth is one thing, and truth
   itself is another. Resemblance is one thing, the thing itself is
   another. And the one results from learning and practice, the other from
   power and faith. For the teaching of piety is a gift, but faith is
   grace. "For by doing the will of God we know the will of God." [1880]
   "Open, then," says the Scripture, "the gates of righteousness; and I
   will enter in, and confess to the Lord." [1881] But the paths to
   righteousness (since God saves in many ways, for He is good) are many
   and various, and lead to the Lord's way and gate. And if you ask the
   royal and true entrance, you will hear, "This is the gate of the Lord,
   the righteous shall enter in by it." [1882] While there are many gates
   open, that in righteousness is in Christ, by which all the blessed
   enter, and direct their steps in the sanctity of knowledge. Now
   Clemens, in his Epistle to the Corinthians, while expounding the
   differences of those who are approved according to the Church, says
   expressly, "One may be a believer; one may be powerful in uttering
   knowledge; one may be wise in discriminating between words; one may be
   terrible in deeds." [1883]

      Chapter VIII.--The Sophistical Arts Useless.

   But the art of sophistry, which the Greeks cultivated, is a fantastic
   power, which makes false opinions like true by means of words. For it
   produces rhetoric in order to persuasion, and disputation for
   wrangling. These arts, therefore, if not conjoined with philosophy,
   will be injurious to every one. For Plato openly called sophistry "an
   evil art." And Aristotle, following him, demonstrates it to be a
   dishonest art, which abstracts in a specious manner the whole business
   of wisdom, and professes a wisdom which it has not studied. To speak
   briefly, as the beginning of rhetoric is the probable, and an attempted
   proof [1884] the process, and the end persuasion, so the beginning of
   disputation is what is matter of opinion, and the process a contest,
   and the end victory. For in the same manner, also, the beginning of
   sophistry is the apparent, and the process twofold; one of rhetoric,
   continuous and exhaustive; and the other of logic, and is
   interrogatory. And its end is admiration. The dialectic in vogue in the
   schools, on the other hand, is the exercise of a philosopher in matters
   of opinion, for the sake of the faculty of disputation. But truth is
   not in these at all. With reason, therefore, the noble apostle,
   depreciating these superfluous arts occupied about words, says, "If any
   man do not give heed to wholesome words, but is puffed up by a kind of
   teaching, knowing nothing, but doting (noson) about questions and
   strifes of words, whereof cometh contention, envy, railings, evil
   surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, destitute of
   the truth." [1885]

   You see how he is moved against them, calling their art of logic--on
   which, those to whom this garrulous mischievous art is dear, whether
   Greeks or barbarians, plume themselves--a disease (nosos). Very
   beautifully, therefore, the tragic poet Euripides says in the
   Phoenissæ,--


   "But a wrongful speech

   Is diseased in itself, and needs skilful medicines." [1886]

   For the saving Word [1887] is called "wholesome," He being the truth;
   and what is wholesome (healthful) remains ever deathless. But
   separation from what is healthful and divine is impiety, and a deadly
   malady. These are rapacious wolves hid in sheep-skins, men-stealers,
   and glozing soul-seducers, secretly, but proved to be robbers; striving
   by fraud and force to catch us who are unsophisticated and have less
   power of speech.


   "Often a man, impeded through want of words, carries less weight

   In expressing what is right, than the man of eloquence.

   But now in fluent mouths the weightiest truths

   They disguise, so that they do not seem what they ought to seem,"

   says the tragedy. Such are these wranglers, whether they follow the
   sects, or practice miserable dialectic arts. These are they that
   "stretch the warp and weave nothing," says the Scripture; [1888]
   prosecuting a bootless task, which the apostle has called "cunning
   craftiness of men whereby they lie in wait to deceive." [1889] "For
   there are," he says, "many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers."
   [1890] Wherefore it was not said to all, "Ye are the salt of the
   earth." [1891] For there are some even of the hearers of the word who
   are like the fishes of the sea, which, reared from their birth in
   brine, yet need salt to dress them for food. Accordingly I wholly
   approve of the tragedy, when it says:--


   "O son, false words can be well spoken,

   And truth may be vanquished by beauty of words.

   But this is not what is most correct, but nature and what is right;

   He who practices eloquence is indeed wise,

   But I consider deeds always better than words."

   We must not, then, aspire to please the multitude. For we do not
   practice what will please them, but what we know is remote from their
   disposition. "Let us not be desirous of vainglory," says the apostle,
   "provoking one another, envying one another." [1892]

   Thus the truth-loving Plato says, as if divinely inspired, "Since I am
   such as to obey nothing but the word, which, after reflection, appears
   to me the best." [1893]

   Accordingly he charges those who credit opinions without intelligence
   and knowledge, with abandoning right and sound reason unwarrantably,
   and believing him who is a partner in falsehood. For to cheat one's
   self of the truth is bad; but to speak the truth, and to hold as our
   opinions positive realities, is good.

   Men are deprived of what is good unwillingly. Nevertheless they are
   deprived either by being deceived or beguiled, or by being compelled
   and not believing. He who believes not, has already made himself a
   willing captive; and he who changes his persuasion is cozened, while he
   forgets that time imperceptibly takes away some things, and reason
   others. And after an opinion has been entertained, pain and anguish,
   and on the other hand contentiousness and anger, compel. Above all, men
   are beguiled who are either bewitched by pleasure or terrified by fear.
   And all these are voluntary changes, but by none of these will
   knowledge ever be attained.

      Chapter IX.--Human Knowledge Necessary for the Understanding of the
      Scriptures.

   Some, who think themselves naturally gifted, do not wish to touch
   either philosophy or logic; nay more, they do not wish to learn natural
   science. They demand bare faith alone, as if they wished, without
   bestowing any care on the vine, straightway to gather clusters from the
   first. Now the Lord is figuratively described as the vine, from which,
   with pains and the art of husbandry, according to the word, the fruit
   is to be gathered.

   We must lop, dig, bind, and perform the other operations. The
   pruning-knife, I should think, and the pick-axe, and the other
   agricultural implements, are necessary for the culture of the vine, so
   that it may produce eatable fruit. And as in husbandry, so also in
   medicine: he has learned to purpose, who has practiced the various
   lessons, so as to be able to cultivate and to heal. So also here, I
   call him truly learned who brings everything to bear on the truth; so
   that, from geometry, and music, and grammar, and philosophy itself,
   culling what is useful, he guards the faith against assault. Now, as
   was said, the athlete is despised who is not furnished for the contest.
   For instance, too, we praise the experienced helmsman who "has seen the
   cities of many men," and the physician who has had large experience;
   thus also some describe the empiric. [1894] And he who brings
   everything to bear on a right life, procuring examples from the Greeks
   and barbarians, this man is an experienced searcher after truth, and in
   reality a man of much counsel, like the touch-stone (that is, the
   Lydian), which is believed to possess the power of distinguishing the
   spurious from the genuine gold. And our much-knowing gnostic can
   distinguish sophistry from philosophy, the art of decoration from
   gymnastics, cookery from physic, and rhetoric from dialectics, and the
   other sects which are according to the barbarian philosophy, from the
   truth itself. And how necessary is it for him who desires to be
   partaker of the power of God, to treat of intellectual subjects by
   philosophising! And how serviceable is it to distinguish expressions
   which are ambiguous, and which in the Testaments are used synonymously!
   For the Lord, at the time of His temptation, skilfully matched the
   devil by an ambiguous expression. And I do not yet, in this connection,
   see how in the world the inventor of philosophy and dialectics, as some
   suppose, is seduced through being deceived by the form of speech which
   consists in ambiguity. And if the prophets and apostles knew not the
   arts by which the exercises of philosophy are exhibited, yet the mind
   of the prophetic and instructive spirit, uttered secretly, because all
   have not an intelligent ear, demands skilful modes of teaching in order
   to clear exposition. For the prophets and disciples of the Spirit knew
   infallibly their mind. For they knew it by faith, in a way which others
   could not easily, as the Spirit has said. But it is not possible for
   those who have not learned to receive it thus. "Write," it is said,
   "the commandments doubly, in counsel and knowledge, that thou mayest
   answer the words of truth to them who send unto thee." [1895] What,
   then, is the knowledge of answering? or what that of asking? It is
   dialectics. What then? Is not speaking our business, and does not
   action proceed from the Word? For if we act not for the Word, we shall
   act against reason. But a rational work is accomplished through God.
   "And nothing," it is said, "was made without Him"--the Word of God.
   [1896]

   And did not the Lord make all things by the Word? Even the beasts work,
   driven by compelling fear. And do not those who are called orthodox
   apply themselves to good works, knowing not what they do?

      Chapter X.--To Act Well of Greater Consequence Than to Speak Well.

   Wherefore the Saviour, taking the bread, first spake and blessed. Then
   breaking the bread, [1897] He presented it, that we might eat it,
   according to reason, and that knowing the Scriptures [1898] we might
   walk obediently. And as those whose speech is evil are no better than
   those whose practice is evil (for calumny is the servant of the sword,
   and evil-speaking inflicts pain; and from these proceed disasters in
   life, such being the effects of evil speech); so also those who are
   given to good speech are near neighbours to those who accomplish good
   deeds. Accordingly discourse refreshes the soul and entices it to
   nobleness; and happy is he who has the use of both his hands. Neither,
   therefore, is he who can act well to be vilified by him who is able to
   speak well; nor is he who is able to speak well to be disparaged by him
   who is capable of acting well. But let each do that for which he is
   naturally fitted. What the one exhibits as actually done, the other
   speaks, preparing, as it were, the way for well-doing, and leading the
   hearers to the practice of good. For there is a saving word, as there
   is a saving work. Righteousness, accordingly, [1899] is not constituted
   without discourse. And as the receiving of good is abolished if we
   abolish the doing of good; so obedience and faith are abolished when
   neither the command, nor one to expound the command, is taken along
   with us. [1900] But now we are benefited mutually and reciprocally by
   words and deeds; but we must repudiate entirely the art of wrangling
   and sophistry, since these sentences of the sophists not only bewitch
   and beguile the many, but sometimes by violence win a Cadmean victory.
   [1901] For true above all is that Psalm, "The just shall live to the
   end, for he shall not see corruption, when he beholds the wise dying."
   [1902] And whom does he call wise? Hear from the Wisdom of Jesus:
   "Wisdom is not the knowledge of evil." [1903] Such he calls what the
   arts of speaking and of discussing have invented. "Thou shalt therefore
   seek wisdom among the wicked, and shalt not find it." [1904] And if you
   inquire again of what sort this is, you are told, "The mouth of the
   righteous man will distil wisdom." [1905] And similarly with truth, the
   art of sophistry is called wisdom.

   But it is my purpose, as I reckon, and not without reason, to live
   according to the Word, and to understand what is revealed; [1906] but
   never affecting eloquence, to be content merely with indicating my
   meaning. And by what term that which I wish to present is shown, I care
   not. For I well know that to be saved, and to aid those who desire to
   be saved, is the best thing, and not to compose paltry sentences like
   gewgaws. "And if," says the Pythagorean in the Politicus of Plato, "you
   guard against solicitude about terms, you will be richer in wisdom
   against old age." [1907] And in the Theoetetus you will find again,
   "And carelessness about names, and expressions, and the want of nice
   scrutiny, is not vulgar and illiberal for the most part, but rather the
   reverse of this, and is sometimes necessary." [1908] This the Scripture
   [1909] has expressed with the greatest possible brevity, when it said,
   "Be not occupied much about words." For expression is like the dress on
   the body. The matter is the flesh and sinews. We must not therefore
   care more for the dress than the safety of the body. For not only a
   simple mode of life, but also a style of speech devoid of superfluity
   and nicety, must be cultivated by him who has adopted the true life, if
   we are to abandon luxury as treacherous and profligate, as the ancient
   Lacedæmonians adjured ointment and purple, deeming and calling them
   rightly treacherous garments and treacherous unguents; since neither is
   that mode of preparing food right where there is more of seasoning than
   of nutriment; nor is that style of speech elegant which can please
   rather than benefit the hearers. Pythagoras exhorts us to consider the
   Muses more pleasant than the Sirens, teaching us to cultivate wisdom
   apart from pleasure, and exposing the other mode of attracting the soul
   as deceptive. For sailing past the Sirens one man has sufficient
   strength, and for answering the Sphinx another one, or, if you please,
   not even one. [1910] We ought never, then, out of desire for vainglory,
   to make broad the phylacteries. It suffices the gnostic [1911] if only
   one hearer is found for him. [1912] You may hear therefore Pindar the
   Boeotian, [1913] who writes, "Divulge not before all the ancient
   speech. The way of silence is sometimes the surest. And the mightiest
   word is a spur to the fight." Accordingly, the blessed apostle very
   appropriately and urgently exhorts us "not to strive about words to no
   profit, but to the subverting of the hearers, but to shun profane and
   vain babblings, for they increase unto more ungodliness, and their word
   will eat as doth a canker." [1914]

      Chapter XI.--What is the Philosophy Which the Apostle Bids Us Shun?

   This, then, "the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God," and of
   those who are "the wise the Lord knoweth their thoughts that they are
   vain." [1915] Let no man therefore glory on account of pre-eminence in
   human thought. For it is written well in Jeremiah, "Let not the wise
   man glory in his wisdom, and let not the mighty man glory in his might,
   and let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth
   glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth that I am the Lord,
   that executeth mercy and judgment and righteousness upon the earth: for
   in these things is my delight, saith the Lord." [1916] "That we should
   trust not in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead," says the
   apostle, "who delivered us from so great a death, that our faith should
   not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God." "For the
   spiritual man judgeth all things, but he himself is judged of no man."
   [1917] I hear also those words of his, "And these things I say, lest
   any man should beguile you with enticing words, or one should enter in
   to spoil you." [1918] And again, "Beware lest any man spoil you through
   philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the
   rudiments of the world, and not after Christ;" [1919] branding not all
   philosophy, but the Epicurean, which Paul mentions in the Acts of the
   Apostles, [1920] which abolishes providence and deifies pleasure, and
   whatever other philosophy honours the elements, but places not over
   them the efficient cause, nor apprehends the Creator. [1921]

   The Stoics also, whom he mentions too, say not well that the Deity,
   being a body, pervades the vilest matter. He calls the jugglery of
   logic "the tradition of men." Wherefore also he adds, "Avoid juvenile
   [1922] questions. For such contentions are puerile." "But virtue is no
   lover of boys," says the philosopher Plato. And our struggle, according
   to Gorgias Leontinus, requires two virtues--boldness and
   wisdom,--boldness to undergo danger, and wisdom to understand the
   enigma. For the Word, like the Olympian proclamation, calls him who is
   willing, and crowns him who is able to continue unmoved as far as the
   truth is concerned. And, in truth, the Word does not wish him who has
   believed to be idle. For He says, "Seek, and ye shall find." [1923] But
   seeking ends in finding, driving out the empty trifling, and approving
   of the contemplation which confirms our faith. "And this I say, lest
   any man beguile you with enticing words," [1924] says the apostle,
   evidently as having learned to distinguish what was said by him, and as
   being taught to meet objections. "As ye have therefore received Christ
   Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, rooted and built up in Him, and
   stablished in the faith." [1925] Now persuasion is [the means of] being
   established in the faith. "Beware lest any man spoil you of faith in
   Christ by philosophy and vain deceit," which does away with providence,
   "after the tradition of men;" for the philosophy which is in accordance
   with divine tradition establishes and confirms providence, which, being
   done away with, the economy of the Saviour appears a myth, while we are
   influenced "after the elements of the world, and not after Christ."
   [1926] For the teaching which is agreeable to Christ deifies the
   Creator, and traces providence in particular events, [1927] and knows
   the nature of the elements to be capable of change and production, and
   teaches that we ought to aim at rising up to the power which
   assimilates to God, and to prefer the dispensation [1928] as holding
   the first rank and superior to all training.

   The elements are worshipped,--the air by Diogenes, the water by Thales,
   the fire by Hippasus; and by those who suppose atoms to be the first
   principles of things, arrogating the name of philosophers, being
   wretched creatures devoted to pleasure. [1929] "Wherefore I pray," says
   the apostle, "that your love may abound yet more and more, in knowledge
   and in all judgment, that ye may approve things that are excellent."
   [1930] "Since, when we were children," says the same apostle, "we were
   kept in bondage under the rudiments of the world. And the child, though
   heir, differeth nothing from a servant, till the time appointed of the
   father." [1931] Philosophers, then, are children, unless they have been
   made men by Christ. "For if the son of the bond woman shall not be heir
   with the son of the free," [1932] at least he is the seed of Abraham,
   though not of promise, receiving what belongs to him by free gift. "But
   strong meat belongeth to those that are of full age, even those who by
   reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and
   evil." [1933] "For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word
   of righteousness; for he is a babe," [1934] and not yet acquainted with
   the word, according to which he has believed and works, and not able to
   give a reason in himself. "Prove all things," the apostle says, "and
   hold fast that which is good," [1935] speaking to spiritual men, who
   judge what is said according to truth, whether it seems or truly holds
   by the truth. "He who is not corrected by discipline errs, and stripes
   and reproofs give the discipline of wisdom," the reproofs manifestly
   that are with love. "For the right heart seeketh knowledge." [1936]
   "For he that seeketh the Lord shall find knowledge with righteousness;
   and they who have sought it rightly have found peace." [1937] "And I
   will know," it is said, "not the speech of those which are puffed up,
   but the power." In rebuke of those who are wise in appearance, and
   think themselves wise, but are not in reality wise, he writes: "For the
   kingdom of God is not in word." [1938] It is not in that which is not
   true, but which is only probable according to opinion; but he said "in
   power," for the truth alone is powerful. And again: "If any man
   thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought
   to know." For truth is never mere opinion. But the "supposition of
   knowledge inflates," and fills with pride; "but charity edifieth,"
   which deals not in supposition, but in truth. Whence it is said, "If
   any man loves, he is known." [1939]

      Chapter XII.--The Mysteries of the Faith Not to Be Divulged to All.

   But since this tradition is not published alone for him who perceives
   the magnificence of the word; it is requisite, therefore, to hide in a
   mystery the wisdom spoken, which the Son of God taught. Now, therefore,
   Isaiah the prophet has his tongue purified by fire, so that he may be
   able to tell the vision. And we must purify not the tongue alone, but
   also the ears, if we attempt to be partakers of the truth.

   Such were the impediments in the way of my writing. And even now I
   fear, as it is said, "to cast the pearls before swine, lest they tread
   them under foot, and turn and rend us." [1940] For it is difficult to
   exhibit the really pure and transparent words respecting the true
   light, to swinish and untrained hearers. For scarcely could anything
   which they could hear be more ludicrous than these to the multitude;
   nor any subjects on the other hand more admirable or more inspiring to
   those of noble nature. "But the natural man receiveth not the things of
   the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him." [1941] But the
   wise do not utter with their mouth what they reason in council. "But
   what ye hear in the ear," says the Lord, "proclaim upon the houses;"
   [1942] bidding them receive the secret traditions [1943] of the true
   knowledge, and expound them aloft and conspicuously; and as we have
   heard in the ear, so to deliver them to whom it is requisite; but not
   enjoining us to communicate to all without distinction, what is said to
   them in parables. But there is only a delineation in the memoranda,
   which have the truth sowed sparse [1944] and broadcast, that it may
   escape the notice of those who pick up seeds like jackdaws; but when
   they find a good husbandman, each one of them will germinate and
   produce corn.

      Chapter XIII.--All Sects of Philosophy Contain a Germ of Truth.

   Since, therefore, truth is one (for falsehood has ten thousand
   by-paths); just as the Bacchantes tore asunder the limbs of Pentheus,
   so the sects both of barbarian and Hellenic philosophy have done with
   truth, and each vaunts as the whole truth the portion which has fallen
   to its lot. But all, in my opinion, [1945] are illuminated by the dawn
   of Light. [1946] Let all, therefore, both Greeks and barbarians, who
   have aspired after the truth,--both those who possess not a little, and
   those who have any portion,--produce whatever they have of the word of
   truth.

   Eternity, for instance, presents in an instant the future and the
   present, also the past of time. But truth, much more powerful than
   limitless duration, can collect its proper germs, though they have
   fallen on foreign soil. For we shall find that very many of the dogmas
   that are held by such sects as have not become utterly senseless, and
   are not cut out from the order of nature (by cutting off Christ, as the
   women of the fable dismembered the man), [1947] though appearing unlike
   one another, correspond in their origin and with the truth as a whole.
   For they coincide in one, either as a part, or a species, or a genus.
   For instance, though the highest note is different from the lowest
   note, yet both compose one harmony. And in numbers an even number
   differs from an odd number; but both suit in arithmetic; as also is the
   case with figure, the circle, and the triangle, and the square, and
   whatever figures differ from one another. Also, in the whole universe,
   all the parts, though differing one from another, preserve their
   relation to the whole. So, then, the barbarian and Hellenic philosophy
   has torn off a fragment of eternal truth not from the mythology of
   Dionysus, but from the theology of the ever-living Word. And He who
   brings again together the separate fragments, and makes them one, will
   without peril, be assured, contemplate the perfect Word, the truth.
   Therefore it is written in Ecclesiastes: "And I added wisdom above all
   who were before me in Jerusalem; and my heart saw many things; and
   besides, I knew wisdom and knowledge, parables and understanding. And
   this also is the choice of the spirit, because in abundance of wisdom
   is abundance of knowledge." [1948] He who is conversant with all kinds
   of wisdom, will be pre-eminently a gnostic. [1949] Now it is written,
   "Abundance of the knowledge of wisdom will give life to him who is of
   it." [1950] And again, what is said is confirmed more clearly by this
   saying, "All things are in the sight of those who understand"--all
   things, both Hellenic and barbarian; but the one or the other is not
   all. "They are right to those who wish to receive understanding. Choose
   instruction, and not silver, and knowledge above tested gold," and
   prefer also sense to pure gold; "for wisdom is better than precious
   stones, and no precious thing is worth it." [1951]

      Chapter XIV.--Succession of Philosophers in Greece.

   The Greeks say, that after Orpheus and Linus, and the most ancient of
   the poets that appeared among them, the seven, called wise, were the
   first that were admired for their wisdom. Of whom four were of
   Asia--Thales of Miletus, and Bias of Priene, Pittacus of Mitylene, and
   Cleobulus of Lindos; and two of Europe, Solon the Athenian, and Chilon
   the Lacedæmonian; and the seventh, some say, was Periander of Corinth;
   others, Anacharsis the Scythian; others, Epimenides the Cretan, whom
   Paul knew as a Greek prophet, whom he mentions in the Epistle to Titus,
   where he speaks thus: "One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said,
   The Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. And this
   witness is true." [1952] You see how even to the prophets of the Greeks
   he attributes something of the truth, and is not ashamed, [1953] when
   discoursing for the edification of some and the shaming of others, to
   make use of Greek poems. Accordingly to the Corinthians (for this is
   not the only instance), while discoursing on the resurrection of the
   dead, he makes use of a tragic Iambic line, when he said, "What
   advantageth it me if the dead are not raised? Let us eat and drink, for
   to-morrow we die. Be not deceived; evil communications corrupt good
   manners." [1954] Others have enumerated Acusilaus the Argive among the
   seven wise men; and others, Pherecydes of Syros. And Plato substitutes
   Myso the Chenian for Periander, whom he deemed unworthy of wisdom, on
   account of his having reigned as a tyrant. That the wise men among the
   Greeks flourished after the age of Moses, will, a little after, be
   shown. But the style of philosophy among them, as Hebraic and
   enigmatical, is now to be considered. They adopted brevity, as suited
   for exhortation, and most useful. Even Plato says, that of old this
   mode was purposely in vogue among all the Greeks, especially the
   Lacedæmonians and Cretans, who enjoyed the best laws.

   The expression, "Know thyself," some supposed to be Chilon's. But
   Chamæleon, in his book About the Gods, ascribes it to Thales; Aristotle
   to the Pythian. It may be an injunction to the pursuit of knowledge.
   For it is not possible to know the parts without the essence of the
   whole; and one must study the genesis of the universe, that thereby we
   may be able to learn the nature of man. Again, to Chilon the
   Lacedæmonian they attribute, "Let nothing be too much." [1955] Strato,
   in his book Of Inventions, ascribes the apophthegm to Stratodemus of
   Tegea. Didymus assigns it to Solon; as also to Cleobulus the saying, "A
   middle course is best." And the expression, "Come under a pledge, and
   mischief is at hand," Cleomenes says, in his book Concerning Hesiod,
   was uttered before by Homer in the lines:--


   "Wretched pledges, for the wretched, to be pledged." [1956]

   The Aristotelians judge it to be Chilon's; but Didymus says the advice
   was that of Thales. Then, next in order, the saying, "All men are bad,"
   or, "The most of men are bad" (for the same apophthegm is expressed in
   two ways), Sotades the Byzantian says that it was Bias's. And the
   aphorism, "Practice conquers everything," [1957] they will have it to
   be Periander's; and likewise the advice, "Know the opportunity," to
   have been a saying of Pittacus. Solon made laws for the Athenians,
   Pittacus for the Mitylenians. And at a late date, Pythagoras, the pupil
   of Pherecydes, first called himself a philosopher. Accordingly, after
   the fore-mentioned three men, there were three schools of philosophy,
   named after the places where they lived: the Italic from Pythagoras,
   the Ionic from Thales, the Eleatic from Xenophanes. Pythagoras was a
   Samian, the son of Mnesarchus, as Hippobotus says: according to
   Aristoxenus, in his life of Pythagoras and Aristarchus and Theopompus,
   he was a Tuscan; and according to Neanthes, a Syrian or a Tyrian. So
   that Pythagoras was, according to the most, of barbarian extraction.
   Thales, too, as Leander and Herodotus relate, was a Phoenician; as some
   suppose, a Milesian. He alone seems to have met the prophets of the
   Egyptians. But no one is described as his teacher, nor is any one
   mentioned as the teacher of Pherecydes of Syros, who had Pythagoras as
   his pupil. But the Italic philosophy, that of Pythagoras, grew old in
   Metapontum in Italy. Anaximander of Miletus, the son of Praxiades,
   succeeded Thales; and was himself succeeded by Anaximenes of Miletus,
   the son of Eurustratus; after whom came Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ, the
   son of Hegesibulus. [1958] He transferred his school from Ionia to
   Athens. He was succeeded by Archelaus, whose pupil Socrates was.


   "From these turned aside, the stone-mason;

   Talker about laws; the enchanter of the Greeks,"

   says Timon in his Satirical Poems, on account of his quitting physics
   for ethics. Antisthenes, after being a pupil of Socrates, introduced
   the Cynic philosophy; and Plato withdrew to the Academy. Aristotle,
   after studying philosophy under Plato, withdrew to the Lyceum, and
   founded the Peripatetic sect. He was succeeded by Theophrastus, who was
   succeeded by Strato, and he by Lycon, then Critolaus, and then
   Diodorus. Speusippus was the successor of Plato; his successor was
   Xenocrates; and the successor of the latter, Polemo. And the disciples
   of Polemo were Crates and Crantor, in whom the old Academy founded by
   Plato ceased. Arcesilaus was the associate of Crantor; from whom, down
   to Hegesilaus, the Middle Academy flourished. Then Carneades succeeded
   Hegesilaus, and others came in succession. The disciple of Crates was
   Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic sect. He was succeeded by
   Cleanthes; and the latter by Chrysippus, and others after him.
   Xenophanes of Colophon was the founder of the Eleatic school, who,
   Timæus says, lived in the time of Hiero, lord of Sicily, and Epicharmus
   the poet; and Apollodorus says that he was born in the fortieth
   Olympiad, and reached to the times of Darius and Cyrus. Parmenides,
   accordingly, was the disciple of Xenophanes, and Zeno of him; then came
   Leucippus, and then Democritus. Disciples of Democritus were Protagoras
   of Abdera, and Metrodorus of Chios, whose pupil was Diogenes of Smyrna;
   and his again Anaxarchus, and his Pyrrho, and his Nausiphanes. Some say
   that Epicurus was a scholar of his.

   Such, in an epitome, is the succession of the philosophers among the
   Greeks. The periods of the originators of their philosophy are now to
   be specified successively, in order that, by comparison, we may show
   that the Hebrew philosophy was older by many generations. [1959]

   It has been said of Xenophanes that he was the founder of the Eleatic
   philosophy. And Eudemus, in the Astrological Histories, says that
   Thales foretold the eclipse of the sun, which took place at the time
   that the Medians and the Lydians fought, in the reign of Cyaxares the
   father of Astyages over the Medes, and of Alyattus the son of Croesus
   over the Lydians. Herodotus in his first book agrees with him. The date
   is about the fiftieth Olympiad. Pythagoras is ascertained to have lived
   in the days of Polycrates the tyrant, about the sixty-second Olympiad.
   Mnesiphilus is described as a follower of Solon, and was a contemporary
   of Themistocles. Solon therefore flourished about the forty-sixth
   Olympiad. For Heraclitus, the son of Bauso, persuaded Melancomas the
   tyrant to abdicate his sovereignty. He despised the invitation of king
   Darius to visit the Persians.

      Chapter XV.--The Greek Philosophy in Great Part Derived from the
      Barbarians.

   These are the times of the oldest wise men and philosophers among the
   Greeks. And that the most of them were barbarians by extraction, and
   were trained among barbarians, what need is there to say? Pythagoras is
   shown to have been either a Tuscan or a Tyrian. And Antisthenes was a
   Phrygian. And Orpheus was an Odrysian or a Thracian. The most, too,
   show Homer to have been an Egyptian. Thales was a Phoenician by birth,
   and was said to have consorted with the prophets of the Egyptians; as
   also Pythagoras did with the same persons, by whom he was circumcised,
   that he might enter the adytum and learn from the Egyptians the mystic
   philosophy. He held converse with the chief of the Chaldeans and the
   Magi; and he gave a hint of the church, now so called, in the common
   hall [1960] which he maintained.

   And Plato does not deny that he procured all that is most excellent in
   philosophy from the barbarians; and he admits that he came into Egypt.
   Whence, writing in the Phoedo that the philosopher can receive aid from
   all sides, he said: "Great indeed is Greece, O Cebes, in which
   everywhere there are good men, and many are the races of the
   barbarians." [1961] Thus Plato thinks that some of the barbarians, too,
   are philosophers. But Epicurus, on the other hand, supposes that only
   Greeks can philosophise. And in the Symposium, Plato, lauding the
   barbarians as practising philosophy with conspicuous excellence, [1962]
   truly says: "And in many other instances both among Greeks and
   barbarians, whose temples reared for such sons are already numerous."
   And it is clear that the barbarians signally honoured their lawgivers
   and teachers, designating them gods. For, according to Plato, "they
   think that good souls, on quitting the super-celestial region, submit
   to come to this Tartarus; and assuming a body, share in all the ills
   which are involved in birth, from their solicitude for the race of
   men;" and these make laws and publish philosophy, "than which no
   greater boon ever came from the gods to the race of men, or will come."
   [1963]

   And as appears to me, it was in consequence of perceiving the great
   benefit which is conferred through wise men, that the men themselves
   were honoured and philosophy cultivated publicly by all the Brahmins,
   and the Odrysi, and the Getæ. And such were strictly deified by the
   race of the Egyptians, by the Chaldeans and the Arabians, called the
   Happy, and those that inhabited Palestine, by not the least portion of
   the Persian race, and by innumerable other races besides these. And it
   is well known that Plato is found perpetually celebrating the
   barbarians, remembering that both himself and Pythagoras learned the
   most and the noblest of their dogmas among the barbarians. Wherefore he
   also called the races of the barbarians, "races of barbarian
   philosophers," recognising, in the Phoedrus, the Egyptian king, and
   shows him to us wiser than Theut, whom he knew to be Hermes. But in the
   Charmides, it is manifest that he knew certain Thracians who were said
   to make the soul immortal. And Pythagoras is reported to have been a
   disciple of Sonches the Egyptian arch-prophet; and Plato, of Sechnuphis
   of Heliopolis; and Eudoxus, of Cnidius of Konuphis, who was also an
   Egyptian. And in his book, On the Soul, [1964] Plato again manifestly
   recognises prophecy, when he introduces a prophet announcing the word
   of Lachesis, uttering predictions to the souls whose destiny is
   becoming fixed. And in the Timæus he introduces Solon, the very wise,
   learning from the barbarian. The substance of the declaration is to the
   following effect: "O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always children. And
   no Greek is an old man. For you have no learning that is hoary with
   age." [1965]

   Democritus appropriated the Babylonian ethic discourses, for he is said
   to have combined with his own compositions a translation of the column
   of Acicarus. [1966] And you may find the distinction notified by him
   when he writes, "Thus says Democritus." About himself, too, where,
   pluming himself on his erudition, he says, "I have roamed over the most
   ground of any man of my time, investigating the most remote parts. I
   have seen the most skies and lands, and I have heard of learned men in
   very great numbers. And in composition no one has surpassed me; in
   demonstration, not even those among the Egyptians who are called
   Arpenodaptæ, with all of whom I lived in exile up to eighty years." For
   he went to Babylon, and Persis, and Egypt, to learn from the Magi and
   the priests.

   Zoroaster the Magus, Pythagoras showed to be a Persian. Of the secret
   books of this man, those who follow the heresy of Prodicus boast to be
   in possession. Alexander, in his book On the Pythagorean Symbols,
   relates that Pythagoras was a pupil of Nazaratus the Assyrian [1967]
   (some think that he is Ezekiel; but he is not, as will afterwards be
   shown), and will have it that, in addition to these, Pythagoras was a
   hearer of the Galatæ and the Brahmins. Clearchus the Peripatetic says
   that he knew a Jew who associated with Aristotle. [1968] Heraclitus
   says that, not humanly, but rather by God's aid, the Sibyl spoke.
   [1969] They say, accordingly, that at Delphi a stone was shown beside
   the oracle, on which, it is said, sat the first Sibyl, who came from
   Helicon, and had been reared by the Muses. But some say that she came
   from Milea, being the daughter of Lamia of Sidon. [1970] And Serapion,
   in his epic verses, says that the Sibyl, even when dead, ceased not
   from divination. And he writes that, what proceeded from her into the
   air after her death, was what gave oracular utterances in voices and
   omens; and on her body being changed into earth, and the grass as
   natural growing out of it, whatever beasts happening to be in that
   place fed on it exhibited to men an accurate knowledge of futurity by
   their entrails. He thinks also, that the face seen in the moon is her
   soul. So much for the Sibyl.

   Numa the king of the Romans was a Pythagorean, and aided by the
   precepts of Moses, prohibited from making an image of God in human
   form, and of the shape of a living creature. Accordingly, during the
   first hundred and seventy years, though building temples, they made no
   cast or graven image. For Numa secretly showed them that the Best of
   Beings could not be apprehended except by the mind alone. Thus
   philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity
   among the barbarians, shedding its light over the nations. And
   afterwards it came to Greece. First in its ranks were the prophets of
   the Egyptians; and the Chaldeans among the Assyrians; and the Druids
   among the Gauls; and the Samanæans among the Bactrians; and the
   philosophers of the Celts; and the Magi of the Persians, who foretold
   the Saviour's birth, and came into the land of Judæa guided by a star.
   The Indian gymnosophists are also in the number, and the other
   barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of
   them called Sarmanæ, [1971] and others Brahmins. And those of the
   Sarmanæ who are called Hylobii [1972] neither inhabit cities, nor have
   roofs over them, but are clothed in the bark of trees, feed on nuts,
   and drink water in their hands. Like those called Encratites in the
   present day, they know not marriage nor begetting of children.

   Some, too, of the Indians obey the precepts of Buddha; [1973] whom, on
   account of his extraordinary sanctity, they have raised to divine
   honours.

   Anacharsis was a Scythian, and is recorded to have excelled many
   philosophers among the Greeks. And the Hyperboreans, Hellanicus
   relates, dwelt beyond the Riphæan mountains, and inculcated justice,
   not eating flesh, but using nuts. Those who are sixty years old they
   take without the gates, and do away with. There are also among the
   Germans those called sacred women, who, by inspecting the whirlpools of
   rivers and the eddies, and observing the noises of streams, presage and
   predict future events. [1974] These did not allow the men to fight
   against Cæsar till the new moon shone.

   Of all these, by far the oldest is the Jewish race; and that their
   philosophy committed to writing has the precedence of philosophy among
   the Greeks, the Pythagorean Philo [1975] shows at large; and, besides
   him, Aristobulus the Peripatetic, and several others, not to waste
   time, in going over them by name. Very clearly the author Megasthenes,
   the contemporary of Seleucus Nicanor, writes as follows in the third of
   his books, On Indian Affairs: "All that was said about nature by the
   ancients is said also by those who philosophise beyond Greece: some
   things by the Brahmins among the Indians, and others by those called
   Jews in Syria." Some more fabulously say that certain of those called
   the Idæan Dactyli were the first wise men; to whom are attributed the
   invention of what are called the "Ephesian letters," and of numbers in
   music. For which reason dactyls in music received their name. And the
   Idæan Dactyli were Phrygians and barbarians. Herodotus relates that
   Hercules, having grown a sage and a student of physics, received from
   the barbarian Atlas, the Phrygian, the columns of the universe; the
   fable meaning that he received by instruction the knowledge of the
   heavenly bodies. And Hermippus of Berytus calls Charon the Centaur
   wise; about whom, he that wrote The Battle of the Titans says, "that he
   first led the race of mortals to righteousness, by teaching them the
   solemnity of the oath, and propitiatory sacrifices and the figures of
   Olympus." By him Achilles, who fought at Troy, was taught. And Hippo,
   the daughter of the Centaur, who dwelt with Æolus, taught him her
   father's science, the knowledge of physics. Euripides also testifies of
   Hippo as follows:--


   "Who first, by oracles, presaged,

   And by the rising stars, events divine."

   By this Æolus, Ulysses was received as a guest after the taking of
   Troy. Mark the epochs by comparison with the age of Moses, and with the
   high antiquity of the philosophy promulgated by him.

      Chapter XVI.--That the Inventors of Other Arts Were Mostly Barbarians.

   And barbarians were inventors not only of philosophy, but almost of
   every art. The Egyptians were the first to introduce astrology among
   men. Similarly also the Chaldeans. The Egyptians first showed how to
   burn lamps, and divided the year into twelve months, prohibited
   intercourse with women in the temples, and enacted that no one should
   enter the temples [1976] from a woman without bathing. Again, they were
   the inventors of geometry. There are some who say that the Carians
   invented prognostication by the stars. The Phrygians were the first who
   attended to the flight of birds. And the Tuscans, neighbours of Italy,
   were adepts at the art of the Haruspex. The Isaurians and the Arabians
   invented augury, as the Telmesians divination by dreams. The Etruscans
   invented the trumpet, and the Phrygians the flute. For Olympus and
   Marsyas were Phrygians. And Cadmus, the inventor of letters among the
   Greeks, as Euphorus says, was a Phoenician; whence also Herodotus
   writes that they were called Phoenician letters. And they say that the
   Phoenicians and the Syrians first invented letters; and that Apis, an
   aboriginal inhabitant of Egypt, invented the healing art before Io came
   into Egypt. But afterwards they say that Asclepius improved the art.
   Atlas the Libyan was the first who built a ship and navigated the sea.
   Kelmis and Damnaneus, Idæan Dactyli, first discovered iron in Cyprus.
   Another Idæan discovered the tempering of brass; according to Hesiod, a
   Scythian. The Thracians first invented what is called a scimitar
   (harpe),--it is a curved sword,--and were the first to use shields on
   horseback. Similarly also the Illyrians invented the shield (pelte).
   Besides, they say that the Tuscans invented the art of moulding clay;
   and that Itanus (he was a Samnite) first fashioned the oblong shield
   (thureos). Cadmus the Phoenician invented stonecutting, and discovered
   the gold mines on the Pangæan mountain. Further, another nation, the
   Cappadocians, first invented the instrument called the nabla, [1977]
   and the Assyrians in the same way the dichord. The Carthaginians were
   the first that constructed a trireme; and it was built by Bosporus, an
   aboriginal. [1978] Medea, the daughter of Æetas, a Colchian, first
   invented the dyeing of hair. Besides, the Noropes (they are a Pæonian
   race, and are now called the Norici) worked copper, and were the first
   that purified iron. Amycus the king of the Bebryci was the first
   inventor of boxing-gloves. [1979] In music, Olympus the Mysian
   practiced the Lydian harmony; and the people called Troglodytes
   invented the sambuca, [1980] a musical instrument. It is said that the
   crooked pipe was invented by Satyrus the Phrygian; likewise also
   diatonic harmony by Hyagnis, a Phrygian too; and notes by Olympus, a
   Phrygian; as also the Phrygian harmony, and the half-Phrygian and the
   half-Lydian, by Marsyas, who belonged to the same region as those
   mentioned above. And the Doric was invented by Thamyris the Thracian.
   We have heard that the Persians were the first who fashioned the
   chariot, and bed, and footstool; and the Sidonians the first to
   construct a trireme. The Sicilians, close to Italy, were the first
   inventors of the phorminx, which is not much inferior to the lyre. And
   they invented castanets. In the time of Semiramis queen of the
   Assyrians, [1981] they relate that linen garments were invented. And
   Hellanicus says that Atossa queen of the Persians was the first who
   composed a letter. These things are reported by Scamo of Mitylene,
   Theophrastus of Ephesus, Cydippus of Mantinea, also Antiphanes,
   Aristodemus, and Aristotle; and besides these, Philostephanus, and also
   Strato the Peripatetic, in his books Concerning Inventions. I have
   added a few details from them, in order to confirm the inventive and
   practically useful genius of the barbarians, by whom the Greeks
   profited in their studies. And if any one objects to the barbarous
   language, Anacharsis says, "All the Greeks speak Scythian to me." It
   was he who was held in admiration by the Greeks, who said, "My covering
   is a cloak; my supper, milk and cheese." You see that the barbarian
   philosophy professes deeds, not words. The apostle thus speaks: "So
   likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue a word easy to be
   understood, how shall ye know what is spoken? for ye shall speak into
   the air. There are, it may be, so many kind of voices in the world, and
   none of them is without signification. Therefore if I know not the
   meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian,
   and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me." And, "Let him that
   speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret." [1982]

   Nay more, it was late before the teaching and writing of discourses
   reached Greece. Alcmæon, the son of Perithus, of Crotona, first
   composed a treatise on nature. And it is related that Anaxagoras of
   Clazomenæ, the son of Hegesibulus, first published a book in writing.
   The first to adapt music to poetical compositions was Terpander of
   Antissa; and he set the laws of the Lacedæmonians to music. Lasus of
   Hermione invented the dithyramb; Stesichorus of Himera, the hymn;
   Alcman the Spartan, the choral song; Anacreon of Teos, love songs;
   Pindar the Theban, the dance accompanied with song. Timotheus of
   Miletus was the first to execute those musical compositions called
   nomoi on the lyre, with dancing. Moreover, the iambus was invented by
   Archilochus of Paros, and the choliambus by Hipponax of Ephesus.
   Tragedy owed its origin to Thespis the Athenian, and comedy to Susarion
   of Icaria. Their dates are handed down by the grammarians. But it were
   tedious to specify them accurately: presently, however, Dionysus, on
   whose account the Dionysian spectacles are celebrated, will be shown to
   be later than Moses. They say that Antiphon of Rhamnusium, the son of
   Sophilus, first invented scholastic discourses and rhetorical figures,
   and was the first who pled causes for a fee, and wrote a forensic
   speech for delivery, [1983] as Diodorus says. And Apollodorus of Cuma
   first assumed the name of critic, and was called a grammarian. Some say
   it was Eratosthenes of Cyrene who was first so called, since he
   published two books which he entitled Grammatica.The first who was
   called a grammarian, as we now use the term, was Praxiphanes, the son
   of Disnysophenes of Mitylene. Zeleucus the Locrian was reported to have
   been the first to have framed laws (in writing). Others say that it was
   Menos the son of Zeus, in the time of Lynceus. He comes after Danaus,
   in the eleventh generation from Inachus and Moses; as we shall show a
   little further on. And Lycurgus, who lived many years after the taking
   of Troy, legislated for the Lacedæmonians a hundred and fifty years
   before the Olympiads. We have spoken before of the age of Solon. Draco
   (he was a legislator too) is discovered to have lived about the three
   hundred and ninth Olympiad. Antilochus, again, who wrote of the learned
   men from the age of Pythagoras to the death of Epicurus, which took
   place in the tenth day of the month Gamelion, makes up altogether three
   hundred and twelve years. Moreover, some say that Phanothea, the wife
   of Icarius, invented the heroic hexameter; others Themis, one of the
   Titanides. Didymus, however, in his work On the Pythagorean Philosophy,
   relates that Theano of Crotona was the first woman who cultivated
   philosophy and composed poems. The Hellenic philosophy then, according
   to some, apprehended the truth accidentally, dimly, partially; as
   others will have it, was set a-going by the devil. Several suppose that
   certain powers, descending from heaven, inspired the whole of
   philosophy. But if the Hellenic philosophy comprehends not the whole
   extent of the truth, and besides is destitute of strength to perform
   the commandments of the Lord, yet it prepares the way for the truly
   royal teaching; training in some way or other, and moulding the
   character, and fitting him who believes in Providence for the reception
   of the truth. [1984]

      Chapter XVII.--On the Saying of the Saviour, "All that Came Before Me Were
      Thieves and Robbers." [1985]

   But, say they, it is written, "All who were before the Lord's advent
   are thieves and robbers." All, then, who are in the Word (for it is
   these that were previous to the incarnation of the Word) are understood
   generally. But the prophets, being sent and inspired by the Lord, were
   not thieves, but servants. The Scripture accordingly says, "Wisdom sent
   her servants, inviting with loud proclamation to a goblet of wine."
   [1986]

   But philosophy, it is said, was not sent by the Lord, but came stolen,
   or given by a thief. It was then some power or angel that had learned
   something of the truth, but abode not in it, that inspired and taught
   these things, not without the Lord's knowledge, who knew before the
   constitution of each essence the issues of futurity, but without His
   prohibition.

   For the theft which reached men then, had some advantage; not that he
   who perpetrated the theft had utility in his eye, but Providence
   directed the issue of the audacious deed to utility. I know that many
   are perpetually assailing us with the allegation, that not to prevent a
   thing happening, is to be the cause of it happening. For they say, that
   the man who does not take precaution against a theft, or does not
   prevent it, is the cause of it: as he is the cause of the conflagration
   who has not quenched it at the beginning; and the master of the vessel
   who does not reef the sail, is the cause of the shipwreck. Certainly
   those who are the causes of such events are punished by the law. For to
   him who had power to prevent, attaches the blame of what happens. We
   say to them, that causation is seen in doing, working, acting; but the
   not preventing is in this respect inoperative. Further, causation
   attaches to activity; as in the case of the shipbuilder in relation to
   the origin of the vessel, and the builder in relation to the
   construction of the house. But that which does not prevent is separated
   from what takes place. Wherefore the effect will be accomplished;
   because that which could have prevented neither acts nor prevents. For
   what activity does that which prevents not exert? Now their assertion
   is reduced to absurdity, if they shall say that the cause of the wound
   is not the dart, but the shield, which did not prevent the dart from
   passing through; and if they blame not the thief, but the man who did
   not prevent the theft. Let them then say, that it was not Hector that
   burned the ships of the Greeks, but Achilles; because, having the power
   to prevent Hector, he did not prevent him; but out of anger (and it
   depended on himself to be angry or not) did not keep back the fire, and
   was a concurring cause. Now the devil, being possessed of free-will,
   was able both to repent and to steal; and it was he who was the author
   of the theft, not the Lord, who did not prevent him. But neither was
   the gift hurtful, so as to require that prevention should intervene.

   But if strict accuracy must be employed in dealing with them, let them
   know, that that which does not prevent what we assert to have taken
   place in the theft, is not a cause at all; but that what prevents is
   involved in the accusation of being a cause. For he that protects with
   a shield is the cause of him whom he protects not being wounded;
   preventing him, as he does, from being wounded. For the demon of
   Socrates was a cause, not by not preventing, but by exhorting, even if
   (strictly speaking) he did not exhort. And neither praises nor
   censures, neither rewards nor punishments, are right, when the soul has
   not the power of inclination and disinclination, but evil is
   involuntary. Whence he who prevents is a cause; while he who prevents
   not judges justly the soul's choice. So in no respect is God the author
   of evil. But since free choice and inclination originate sins, and a
   mistaken judgment sometimes prevails, from which, since it is ignorance
   and stupidity, we do not take pains to recede, punishments are rightly
   inflicted. For to take fever is involuntary; but when one takes fever
   through his own fault, from excess, we blame him. Inasmuch, then, as
   evil is involuntary,--for no one prefers evil as evil; but induced by
   the pleasure that is in it, and imagining it good, considers it
   desirable;--such being the case, to free ourselves from ignorance, and
   from evil and voluptuous choice, and above all, to withhold our assent
   from those delusive phantasies, depends on ourselves. The devil is
   called "thief and robber;" having mixed false prophets with the
   prophets, as tares with the wheat. "All, then, that came before the
   Lord, were thieves and robbers;" not absolutely all men, but all the
   false prophets, and all who were not properly sent by Him. For the
   false prophets possessed the prophetic name dishonestly, being
   prophets, but prophets of the liar. For the Lord says, "Ye are of your
   father the devil; and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a
   murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there
   is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for
   he is a liar, and the father of it." [1987]

   But among the lies, the false prophets also told some true things. And
   in reality they prophesied "in an ecstasy," as [1988] the servants of
   the apostate. And the Shepherd, the angel of repentance, says to
   Hermas, of the false prophet: "For he speaks some truths. For the devil
   fills him with his own spirit, if perchance he may be able to cast down
   any one from what is right." All things, therefore, are dispensed from
   heaven for good, "that by the Church may be made known the manifold
   wisdom of God, according to the eternal foreknowledge, [1989] which He
   purposed in Christ." [1990] Nothing withstands God: nothing opposes
   Him: seeing He is Lord and omnipotent. Further, the counsels and
   activities of those who have rebelled, being partial, proceed from a
   bad disposition, as bodily diseases from a bad constitution, but are
   guided by universal Providence to a salutary issue, even though the
   cause be productive of disease. It is accordingly the greatest
   achievement of divine Providence, not to allow the evil, which has
   sprung from voluntary apostasy, to remain useless, and for no good, and
   not to become in all respects injurious. For it is the work of the
   divine wisdom, and excellence, and power, not alone to do good (for
   this is, so to speak, the nature of God, as it is of fire to warm and
   of light to illumine), but especially to ensure that what happens
   through the evils hatched by any, may come to a good and useful issue,
   and to use to advantage those things which appear to be evils, as also
   the testimony which accrues from temptation.

   There is then in philosophy, though stolen as the fire by Prometheus, a
   slender spark, capable of being fanned into flame, a trace of wisdom
   and an impulse from God. Well, be it so that "the thieves and robbers"
   are the philosophers among the Greeks, who from the Hebrew prophets
   before the coming of the Lord received fragments of the truth, not with
   full knowledge, and claimed these as their own teachings, disguising
   some points, treating others sophistically by their ingenuity, and
   discovering other things, for perchance they had "the spirit of
   perception." [1991] Aristotle, too, assented to Scripture, and declared
   sophistry to have stolen wisdom, as we intimated before. And the
   apostle says, "Which things we speak, not in the words which man's
   wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth." [1992] For of the
   prophets it is said, "We have all received of His fulness," [1993] that
   is, of Christ's. So that the prophets are not thieves. "And my doctrine
   is not Mine," saith the Lord, "but the Father's which sent me." And of
   those who steal He says: "But he that speaketh of himself, seeketh his
   own glory." [1994] Such are the Greeks, "lovers of their own selves,
   and boasters." [1995] Scripture, when it speaks of these as wise, does
   not brand those who are really wise, but those who are wise in
   appearance.

      Chapter XVIII.--He Illustrates the Apostle's Saying, "I Will Destroy the
      Wisdom of the Wise."

   And of such it is said, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise: I will
   bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent." The apostle
   accordingly adds, "Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the
   disputer of this world?" setting in contradistinction to the scribes,
   the disputers [1996] of this world, the philosophers of the Gentiles.
   "Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?" [1997] which is
   equivalent to, showed it to be foolish, and not true, as they thought.
   And if you ask the cause of their seeming wisdom, he will say, "because
   of the blindness of their heart;" since "in the wisdom of God," that
   is, as proclaimed by the prophets, "the world knew not," in the wisdom
   "which spake by the prophets," "Him," [1998] that is, God,--"it pleased
   God by the foolishness of preaching"--what seemed to the Greeks
   foolishness--"to save them that believe. For the Jews require signs,"
   in order to faith; "and the Greeks seek after wisdom," plainly those
   reasonings styled "irresistible," and those others, namely, syllogisms.
   "But we preach Jesus Christ crucified; to the Jews a stumbling-block,"
   because, though knowing prophecy, they did not believe the event: "to
   the Greeks, foolishness;" for those who in their own estimation are
   wise, consider it fabulous that the Son of God should speak by man and
   that God should have a Son, and especially that that Son should have
   suffered. Whence their preconceived idea inclines them to disbelieve.
   For the advent of the Saviour did not make people foolish, and hard of
   heart, and unbelieving, but made them understanding, amenable to
   persuasion, and believing. But those that would not believe, by
   separating themselves from the voluntary adherence of those who obeyed,
   were proved to be without understanding, unbelievers and fools. "But to
   them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God,
   and the wisdom of God." Should we not understand (as is better) the
   words rendered, "Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?"
   negatively: "God hath not made foolish the wisdom of the world?"--so
   that the cause of their hardness of heart may not appear to have
   proceeded from God, "making foolish the wisdom of the world." For on
   all accounts, being wise, they incur greater blame in not believing the
   proclamation. For the preference and choice of truth is voluntary. But
   that declaration, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise," declares Him
   to have sent forth light, by bringing forth in opposition the despised
   and contemned barbarian philosophy; as the lamp, when shone upon by the
   sun, is said to be extinguished, on account of its not then exerting
   the same power. All having been therefore called, those who are willing
   to obey have been named [1999] "called." For there is no
   unrighteousness with God. Those of either race who have believed, are
   "a peculiar people." [2000] And in the Acts of the Apostles you will
   find this, word for word, "Those then who received his word were
   baptized;" [2001] but those who would not obey kept themselves aloof.
   To these prophecy says, "If ye be willing and hear me, ye shall eat the
   good things of the land;" [2002] proving that choice or refusal depends
   on ourselves. The apostle designates the doctrine which is according to
   the Lord, "the wisdom of God," in order to show that the true
   philosophy has been communicated by the Son. Further, he, who has a
   show of wisdom, has certain exhortations enjoined on him by the
   apostle: "That ye put on the new man, which after God is renewed in
   righteousness and true holiness. Wherefore, putting away lying, speak
   every man truth. Neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole,
   steal no more; but rather let him labour, working that which is good"
   (and to work is to labour in seeking the truth; for it is accompanied
   with rational well-doing), "that ye may have to give to him that has
   need," [2003] both of worldly wealth and of divine wisdom. For he
   wishes both that the word be taught, and that the money be put into the
   bank, accurately tested, to accumulate interest. Whence he adds, "Let
   no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,"--that is "corrupt
   communication" which proceeds out of conceit,--"but that which is good
   for the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers."
   And the word of the good God must needs be good. And how is it possible
   that he who saves shall not be good?

   Since, then, the Greeks are testified to have laid down some true
   opinions, we may from this point take a glance at the testimonies.
   Paul, in the Acts of the Apostles, is recorded to have said to the
   Areopagites, "I perceive that ye are more than ordinarily religious.
   For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with
   the inscription, To The Unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly
   worship, Him declare I unto you. God, that made the world and all
   things therein, seeing that He is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth
   not in temples made with hands; neither is worshipped with men's hands,
   as though He needed anything, seeing He giveth to all life, and breath,
   and all things; and hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell
   on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before
   appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek
   God, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him; though He be not
   far from every one of us: for in Him we live, and move, and have our
   being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we also are His
   offspring." [2004] Whence it is evident that the apostle, by availing
   himself of poetical examples from the Phenomena of Aratus, approves of
   what had been well spoken by the Greeks; and intimates that, by the
   unknown God, God the Creator was in a roundabout way worshipped by the
   Greeks; but that it was necessary by positive knowledge to apprehend
   and learn Him by the Son. "Wherefore, then, I send thee to the
   Gentiles," it is said, "to open their eyes, and to turn them from
   darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that they may
   receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them that are
   sanctified by faith which is in Me." [2005] Such, then, are the eyes of
   the blind which are opened. The knowledge of the Father by the Son is
   the comprehension of the "Greek circumlocution;" [2006] and to turn
   from the power of Satan is to change from sin, through which bondage
   was produced. We do not, indeed, receive absolutely all philosophy, but
   that of which Socrates [2007] speaks in Plato. "For there are (as they
   say) in the mysteries many bearers of the thyrsus, but few bacchanals;"
   meaning, "that many are called, but few chosen." He accordingly plainly
   adds: "These, in my opinion, are none else than those who have
   philosophized right; to belong to whose number, I myself have left
   nothing undone in life, as far as I could, but have endeavoured in
   every way. Whether we have endeavoured rightly and achieved aught, we
   shall know when we have gone there, if God will, a little afterwards."
   Does he not then seem to declare from the Hebrew Scriptures the
   righteous man's hope, through faith, after death? And in Demodocus
   [2008] (if that is really the work of Plato): "And do not imagine that
   I call it philosophizing to spend life pottering about the arts, or
   learning many things, but something different; since I, at least, would
   consider this a disgrace." For he knew, I reckon, "that the knowledge
   of many things does not educate the mind," [2009] according to
   Heraclitus. And in the fifth book of the Republic, [2010] he says,
   "Shall we then call all these, and the others which study such things,
   and those who apply themselves to the meaner arts, philosophers?' By no
   means,' I said, but like philosophers.' And whom,' said he, do you call
   true?' Those,' said I, who delight in the contemplation of truth. For
   philosophy is not in geometry, with its postulates and hypotheses; nor
   in music, which is conjectural; nor in astronomy, crammed full of
   physical, fluid, and probable causes. But the knowledge of the good and
   truth itself are requisite,--what is good being one thing, and the ways
   to the good another.'" [2011] So that he does not allow that the
   curriculum of training suffices for the good, but co-operates in
   rousing and training the soul to intellectual objects. Whether, then,
   they say that the Greeks gave forth some utterances of the true
   philosophy by accident, it is the accident of a divine administration
   (for no one will, for the sake of the present argument with us, deify
   chance); or by good fortune, good fortune is not unforeseen. Or were
   one, on the other hand, to say that the Greeks possessed a natural
   conception of these things, we know the one Creator of nature; just as
   we also call righteousness natural; or that they had a common
   intellect, let us reflect who is its father, and what righteousness is
   in the mental economy. For were one to name "prediction," [2012] and
   assign as its cause "combined utterance," [2013] he specifies forms of
   prophecy. Further, others will have it that some truths were uttered by
   the philosophers, in appearance.

   The divine apostle writes accordingly respecting us: "For now we see as
   through a glass;" [2014] knowing ourselves in it by reflection, and
   simultaneously contemplating, as we can, the efficient cause, from
   that, which, in us, is divine. For it is said, "Having seen thy
   brother, thou hast seen thy God:" methinks that now the Saviour God is
   declared to us. But after the laying aside of the flesh, "face to
   face,"--then definitely and comprehensively, when the heart becomes
   pure. And by reflection and direct vision, those among the Greeks who
   have philosophized accurately, see God. For such, through our weakness,
   are our true views, as images are seen in the water, and as we see
   things through pellucid and transparent bodies. Excellently therefore
   Solomon says: "He who soweth righteousness, worketh faith." [2015] "And
   there are those who, sewing their own, make increase." [2016] And
   again: "Take care of the verdure on the plain, and thou shalt cut grass
   and gather ripe hay, that thou mayest have sheep for clothing." [2017]
   You see how care must be taken for external clothing and for keeping.
   "And thou shalt intelligently know the souls of thy flock." [2018] "For
   when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things
   contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto
   themselves; uncircumcision observing the precepts of the law," [2019]
   according to the apostle, both before the law and before the advent. As
   if making comparison of those addicted to philosophy with those called
   heretics, [2020] the Word most clearly says: "Better is a friend that
   is near, than a brother that dwelleth afar off." [2021] "And he who
   relies on falsehoods, feeds on the winds, and pursues winged birds."
   [2022] I do not think that philosophy directly declares the Word,
   although in many instances philosophy attempts and persuasively teaches
   us probable arguments; but it assails the sects. Accordingly it is
   added: "For he hath forsaken the ways of his own vineyard, and wandered
   in the tracks of his own husbandry." Such are the sects which deserted
   the primitive Church. [2023] Now he who has fallen into heresy passes
   through an arid wilderness, abandoning the only true God, destitute of
   God, seeking waterless water, reaching an uninhabited and thirsty land,
   collecting sterility with his hands. And those destitute of prudence,
   that is, those involved in heresies, "I enjoin," remarks Wisdom,
   saying, "Touch sweetly stolen bread and the sweet water of theft;"
   [2024] the Scripture manifestly applying the terms bread and water to
   nothing else but to those heresies, which employ bread and water in the
   oblation, not according to the canon of the Church. For there are those
   who celebrate the Eucharist with mere water. "But begone, stay not in
   her place:" place is the synagogue, not the Church. He calls it by the
   equivocal name, place. Then He subjoins: "For so shalt thou pass
   through the water of another;" reckoning heretical baptism not proper
   and true water. "And thou shalt pass over another's river," that rushes
   along and sweeps down to the sea; into which he is cast who, having
   diverged from the stability which is according to truth, rushes back
   into the heathenish and tumultous waves of life.

      Chapter XX.--In What Respect Philosophy Contributes to the Comprehension
      of Divine Truth.

   As many men drawing down the ship, cannot be called many causes, but
   one cause consisting of many;--for each individual by himself is not
   the cause of the ship being drawn, but along with the rest;--so also
   philosophy, being the search for truth, contributes to the
   comprehension of truth; not as being the cause of comprehension, but a
   cause along with other things, and co-operator; perhaps also a joint
   cause. And as the several virtues are causes of the happiness of one
   individual; and as both the sun, and the fire, and the bath, and
   clothing are of one getting warm: so while truth is one, many things
   contribute to its investigation. But its discovery is by the Son. If
   then we consider, virtue is, in power, one. But it is the case, that
   when exhibited in some things, it is called prudence, in others
   temperance, and in others manliness or righteousness. By the same
   analogy, while truth is one, in geometry there is the truth of
   geometry; in music, that of music; and in the right philosophy, there
   will be Hellenic truth. But that is the only authentic truth,
   unassailable, in which we are instructed by the Son of God. In the same
   way we say, that the drachma being one and the same, when given to the
   shipmaster, is called the fare; to the tax-gatherer, tax; to the
   landlord, rent; to the teacher, fees; to the seller, an earnest. And
   each, whether it be virtue or truth, called by the same name, is the
   cause of its own peculiar effect alone; and from the blending of them
   arises a happy life. For we are not made happy by names alone, when we
   say that a good life is happiness, and that the man who is adorned in
   his soul with virtue is happy. But if philosophy contributes remotely
   to the discovery of truth, by reaching, by diverse essays, after the
   knowledge which touches close on the truth, the knowledge possessed by
   us, it aids him who aims at grasping it, in accordance with the Word,
   to apprehend knowledge. But the Hellenic truth is distinct from that
   held by us (although it has got the same name), both in respect of
   extent of knowledge, certainly of demonstration, divine power, and the
   like. For we are taught of God, being instructed in the truly "sacred
   letters" [2025] by the Son of God. Whence those, to whom we refer,
   influence souls not in the way we do, but by different teaching. And
   if, for the sake of those who are fond of fault-finding, we must draw a
   distinction, by saying that philosophy is a concurrent and cooperating
   cause of true apprehension, being the search for truth, then we shall
   avow it to be a preparatory training for the enlightened man (tou
   gnostikou); not assigning as the cause that which is but the
   joint-cause; nor as the upholding cause, what is merely co-operative;
   nor giving to philosophy the place of a sine quâ non. Since almost all
   of us, without training in arts and sciences, and the Hellenic
   philosophy, and some even without learning at all, through the
   influence of a philosophy divine and barbarous, and by power, have
   through faith received the word concerning God, trained by
   self-operating wisdom. But that which acts in conjunction with
   something else, being of itself incapable of operating by itself, we
   describe as co-operating and concausing, and say that it becomes a
   cause only in virtue of its being a joint-cause, and receives the name
   of cause only in respect of its concurring with something else, but
   that it cannot by itself produce the right effect.

   Although at one time philosophy justified the Greeks, [2026] not
   conducting them to that entire righteousness to which it is ascertained
   to cooperate, as the first and second flight of steps help you in your
   ascent to the upper room, and the grammarian helps the philosopher. Not
   as if by its abstraction, the perfect Word would be rendered
   incomplete, or truth perish; since also sight, and hearing, and the
   voice contribute to truth, but it is the mind which is the appropriate
   faculty for knowing it. But of those things which co-operate, some
   contribute a greater amount of power; some, a less. Perspicuity
   accordingly aids in the communication of truth, and logic in preventing
   us from falling under the heresies by which we are assailed. But the
   teaching, which is according to the Saviour, is complete in itself and
   without defect, being "the power and wisdom of God;" [2027] and the
   Hellenic philosophy does not, by its approach, make the truth more
   powerful; but rendering powerless the assault of sophistry against it,
   and frustrating the treacherous plots laid against the truth, is said
   to be the proper "fence and wall of the vineyard." And the truth which
   is according to faith is as necessary for life as bread; while the
   preparatory discipline is like sauce and sweetmeats. "At the end of the
   dinner, the dessert is pleasant," according to the Theban Pindar. And
   the Scripture has expressly said, "The innocent will become wiser by
   understanding, and the wise will receive knowledge." [2028] "And he
   that speaketh of himself," saith the Lord, "seeketh his own glory; but
   He that seeketh His glory that sent Him is true, and there is no
   unrighteousness in Him." [2029] On the other hand, therefore, he who
   appropriates what belongs to the barbarians, and vaunts it is his own,
   does wrong, increasing his own glory, and falsifying the truth. It is
   such an one that is by Scripture called a "thief." It is therefore
   said, "Son, be not a liar; for falsehood leads to theft." Nevertheless
   the thief possesses really, what he has possessed himself of
   dishonestly, [2030] whether it be gold, or silver, or speech, or dogma.
   The ideas, then, which they have stolen, and which are partially true,
   they know by conjecture and necessary logical deduction: on becoming
   disciples, therefore, they will know them with intelligent
   apprehension.

      Chapter XXI.--The Jewish Institutions and Laws of Far Higher Antiquity
      Than the Philosophy of the Greeks.

   On the plagiarizing of the dogmas of the philosophers from the Hebrews,
   we shall treat a little afterwards. But first, as due order demands, we
   must now speak of the epoch of Moses, by which the philosophy of the
   Hebrews will be demonstrated beyond all contradiction to be the most
   ancient of all wisdom. This has been discussed with accuracy by Tatian
   in his book To the Greeks, and by Cassian in the first book of his
   Exegetics. Nevertheless our commentary demands that we too should run
   over what has been said on the point. Apion, then, the grammarian,
   surnamed Pleistonices, in the fourth book of The Egyptian Histories,
   although of so hostile a disposition towards the Hebrews, being by race
   an Egyptian, as to compose a work against the Jews, when referring to
   Amosis king of the Egyptians, and his exploits, adduces, as a witness,
   Ptolemy of Mendes. And his remarks are to the following effect: Amosis,
   who lived in the time of the Argive Inachus, overthrew Athyria, as
   Ptolemy of Mendes relates in his Chronology. Now this Ptolemy was a
   priest; and setting forth the deeds of the Egyptian kings in three
   entire books, he says, that the exodus of the Jews from Egypt, under
   the conduct of Moses, took place while Amosis was king of Egypt. Whence
   it is seen that Moses flourished in the time of Inachus. And of the
   Hellenic states, the most ancient is the Argolic, I mean that which
   took its rise from Inachus, as Dionysius of Halicarnassus teaches in
   his Times. And younger by forty generations than it was Attica, founded
   by Cecrops, who was an aboriginal of double race, as Tatian expressly
   says; and Arcadia, founded by Pelasgus, younger too by nine
   generations; and he, too, is said to have been an aboriginal. And more
   recent than this last by fifty-two generations, was Pthiotis, founded
   by Deucalion. And from the time of Inachus to the Trojan war twenty
   generations or more are reckoned; let us say, four hundred years and
   more. And if Ctesias says that the Assyrian power is many years older
   than the Greek, the exodus of Moses from Egypt will appear to have
   taken place in the forty-second year of the Assyrian empire, [2031] in
   the thirty-second year of the reign of Belochus, in the time of Amosis
   the Egyptian, and of Inachus the Argive. And in Greece, in the time of
   Phoroneus, who succeeded Inachus, the flood of Ogyges occurred; and
   monarchy subsisted in Sicyon first in the person of Ægialeus, then of
   Europs, then of Telches; in Crete, in the person of Cres. For Acusilaus
   says that Phoroneus was the first man. Whence, too, the author of
   Phoronis said that he was "the father of mortal men." Thence Plato in
   the Timoeus, following Acusilaus, writes: "And wishing to draw them out
   into a discussion respecting antiquities, he [2032] said that he
   ventured to speak of the most remote antiquities of this city [2033]
   respecting Phoroneus, called the first man, and Niobe, and what
   happened after the deluge." And in the time of Phorbus lived Actæus,
   from whom is derived Actaia, Attica; and in the time of Triopas lived
   Prometheus, and Atlas, and Epimetheus, and Cecrops of double race, and
   Ino. And in the time of Crotopus occurred the burning of Phaëthon, and
   the deluge [2034] of Deucalion; and in the time of Sthenelus, the reign
   of Amphictyon, and the arrival of Danaus in the Peloponnesus; and
   trader Dardanus happened the building of Dardania, whom, says Homer,


   "First cloud-compelling Zeus begat,"--

   and the transmigration from Crete into Phoenicia. And in the time of
   Lynceus took place the abduction of Proserpine, and the dedication of
   the sacred enclosure in Eleusis, and the husbandry of Triptolemus, and
   the arrival of Cadmus in Thebes, and the reign of Minos. And in the
   time of Proetus the war of Eumolpus with the Athenians took place; and
   in the time of Acrisius, the removal of Pelops from Phrygia, the
   arrival of Ion at Athens; and the second Cecrops appeared, and the
   exploits of Perseus and Dionysus took place, and Orpheus and Musæus
   lived. And in the eighteenth year of the reign of Agamemnon, Troy was
   taken, in the first year of the reign of Demophon the son of Theseus at
   Athens, on the twelfth day of the month Thargelion, as Dionysius the
   Argive says; but Ægias and Dercylus, in the third book, say that it was
   on the eighth day of the last division of the month Panemus; Hellanicus
   says that it was on the twelfth of the month Thargelion; and some of
   the authors of the Attica say that it was on the eighth of the last
   division of the month in the last year of Menestheus, at full moon.


   "It was midnight,"

   says the author of the Little Iliad,


   "And the moon shone clear."

   Others say, it took place on the same day of Scirophorion. But Theseus,
   the rival of Hercules, is older by a generation than the Trojan war.
   Accordingly Tlepolemus, a son of Hercules, is mentioned by Homer, as
   having served at Troy.

   Moses, then, is shown to have preceded the deification of Dionysus six
   hundred and four years, if he was deified in the thirty-second year of
   the reign of Perseus, as Apollodorus says in his Chronology. From
   Bacchus to Hercules and the chiefs that sailed with Jason in the ship
   Argo, are comprised sixty-three years. Æsculapius and the Dioscuri
   sailed with them, as Apollonius Rhodius testifies in his Argonautics.
   And from the reign of Hercules, in Argos, to the deification of
   Hercules and of Æsculapius, are comprised thirty-eight years, according
   to Apollodorus the chronologist; from this to the deification of Castor
   and Pollux, fifty-three years. And at this time Troy was taken. And if
   we may believe the poet Hesiod, let us hear him:--


   "Then to Jove, Maia, Atlas' daughter, bore renowned Hermes,

   Herald of the immortals, having ascended the sacred couch.

   And Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, too, bore an illustrious son,

   Dionysus, the joy-inspiring, when she mingled with him in love." [2035]

   Cadmus, the father of Semele, came to Thebes in the time of Lynceus,
   and was the inventor of the Greek letters. Triopas was a contemporary
   of Isis, in the seventh generation from Inachus. And Isis, who is the
   same as Io, is so called, it is said, from her going (ienai) roaming
   over the whole earth. Her, Istrus, in his work on the migration of the
   Egyptians, calls the daughter of Prometheus. Prometheus lived in the
   time of Triopas, in the seventh generation after Moses. So that Moses
   appears to have flourished even before the birth of men, according to
   the chronology of the Greeks. Leon, who treated of the Egyptian
   divinities, says that Isis by the Greeks was called Ceres, who lived in
   the time of Lynceus, in the eleventh generation after Moses. And Apis
   the king of Argos built Memphis, as Aristippus says in the first book
   of the Arcadica. And Aristeas the Argive says that he was named
   Serapis, and that it is he that the Egyptians worship. And Nymphodorus
   of Amphipolis, in the third book of the Institutions of Asia, says that
   the bull Apis, dead and laid in a coffin (soros), was deposited in the
   temple of the god (daimonos) there worshipped, and thence was called
   Soroapis, and afterwards Serapis by the custom of the natives. And Apis
   is third after Inachus. Further, Latona lived in the time of Tityus.
   "For he dragged Latona, the radiant consort of Zeus." Now Tityus was
   contemporary with Tantalus. Rightly, therefore, the Boeotian Pindar
   writes, "And in time was Apollo born;" and no wonder when he is found
   along with Hercules, serving Admetus "for a long year." Zethus and
   Amphion, the inventors of music, lived about the age of Cadmus. And
   should one assert that Phemonoe was the first who sang oracles in verse
   to Acrisius, let him know that twenty-seven years after Phemonoe, lived
   Orpheus, and Musæus, and Linus the teacher of Hercules. And Homer and
   Hesiod are much more recent than the Trojan war; and after them the
   legislators among the Greeks are far more recent, Lycurgus and Solon,
   and the seven wise men, and Pherecydes of Syros, and Pythagoras the
   great, who lived later, about the Olympiads, as we have shown. We have
   also demonstrated Moses to be more ancient, not only than those called
   poets and wise men among the Greeks, but than the most of their
   deities. Nor he alone, but the Sibyl also is more ancient than Orpheus.
   For it is said, that respecting her appellation and her oracular
   utterances there are several accounts; that being a Phrygian, she was
   called Artemis; and that on her arrival at Delphi, she sang--


   "O Delphians, ministers of far-darting Apollo,

   I come to declare the mind of Ægis-bearing Zeus,

   Enraged as I am at my own brother Apollo."

   There is another also, an Erythræan, called Herophile. These are
   mentioned by Heraclides of Pontus in his work On Oracles. I pass over
   the Egyptian Sibyl, and the Italian, who inhabited the Carmentale in
   Rome, whose son was Evander, who built the temple of Pan in Rome,
   called the Lupercal.

   It is worth our while, having reached this point, to examine the dates
   of the other prophets among the Hebrews who succeeded Moses. After the
   close of Moses's life, Joshua succeeded to the leadership of the
   people, and he, after warring for sixty-five years, rested in the good
   land other five-and-twenty. As the book of Joshua relates, the above
   mentioned man was the successor of Moses twenty-seven years. Then the
   Hebrews having sinned, were delivered to Chusachar [2036] king of
   Mesopotamia for eight years, as the book of Judges mentions. But having
   afterwards besought the Lord, they receive for leader Gothoniel, [2037]
   the younger brother of Caleb, of the tribe of Judah, who, having slain
   the king of Mesopotamia, ruled over the people forty years in
   succession. And having again sinned, they were delivered into the hands
   of Æglom [2038] king of the Moabites for eighteen years. But on their
   repentance, Aod, [2039] a man who had equal use of both hands, of the
   tribe of Ephraim, was their leader for eighty years. It was he that
   despatched Æglom. On the death of Aod, and on their sinning again, they
   were delivered into the hand of Jabim [2040] king of Canaan twenty
   years. After him Deborah the wife of Lapidoth, of the tribe of Ephraim,
   prophesied; and Ozias the son of Rhiesu was high priest. At her
   instance Barak the son of Bener, [2041] of the tribe of Naphtali,
   commanding the army, having joined battle with Sisera, Jabim's
   commander-in-chief, conquered him. And after that Deborah ruled,
   judging the people forty years. On her death, the people having again
   sinned, were delivered into the hands of the Midianites seven years.
   After these events, Gideon, of the tribe of Manasseh, the son of Joas,
   having fought with his three hundred men, and killed a hundred and
   twenty thousand, ruled forty years; after whom the son of Ahimelech,
   three years. He was succeeded by Boleas, the son of Bedan, the son of
   Charran, [2042] of the tribe of Ephraim, who ruled twenty-three years.
   After whom, the people having sinned again, were delivered to the
   Ammonites eighteen years; and on their repentance were commanded by
   Jephtha the Gileadite, of the tribe of Manasseh; and he ruled six
   years. After whom, Abatthan [2043] of Bethlehem, of the tribe of Juda,
   ruled seven years. Then Ebron [2044] the Zebulonite, eight years. Then
   Eglom of Ephraim, eight years. Some add to the seven years of Abatthan
   the eight of Ebrom. [2045] And after him, the people having again
   transgressed, came under the power of the foreigners, the Philistines,
   for forty years. But on their returning [to God], they were led by
   Samson, of the tribe of Dan, who conquered the foreigners in battle. He
   ruled twenty years. And after him, there being no governor, Eli the
   priest judged the people for forty years. He was succeeded by Samuel
   the prophet; contemporaneously with whom Saul reigned, who held sway
   for twenty-seven years. He anointed David. Samuel died two years before
   Saul, while Abimelech was high priest. He anointed Saul as king, who
   was the first that bore regal sway over Israel after the judges; the
   whole duration of whom, down to Saul, was four hundred and sixty-three
   years and seven months.

   Then in the first book of Kings there are twenty years of Saul, during
   which he reigned after he was renovated. And after the death of Saul,
   David the son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah, reigned next in Hebron,
   forty years, as is contained in the second book of Kings. And Abiathar
   the son of Abimelech, of the kindred of Eli, was high priest. In his
   time Gad and Nathan prophesied. From Joshua the son of Nun, then, till
   David received the kingdom, there intervene, according to some, four
   hundred and fifty years. But, as the chronology set forth shows, five
   hundred and twenty-three years and seven months are comprehended till
   the death of David.

   And after this Solomon the son of David reigned forty years. Under him
   Nathan continued to prophesy, who also exhorted him respecting the
   building of the temple. Achias of Shilo also prophesied. And both the
   kings, David and Solomon, were prophets. And Sadoc the high priest was
   the first who ministered in the temple which Solomon built, being the
   eighth from Aaron, the first high priest. From Moses, then, to the age
   of Solomon, as some say, are five hundred and ninety-five years, and as
   others, five hundred and seventy-six.

   And if you count, along with the four hundred and fifty years from
   Joshua to David, the forty years of the rule of Moses, and the other
   eighty years of Moses's life previous to the exodus of the Hebrews from
   Egypt, you will make up the sum in all of six hundred and ten years.
   But our chronology will run more correctly, if to the five hundred and
   twenty-three years and seven months till the death of David, you add
   the hundred and twenty years of Moses and the forty years of Solomon.
   For you will make up in all, down to the death of Solomon, six hundred
   and eighty-three years and seven months.

   Hiram gave his daughter to Solomon about the time of the arrival of
   Menelaus in Phoenicia, after the capture of Troy, as is said by
   Menander of Pergamus, and Lætus in The Phoenicia. And after Solomon,
   Roboam his son reigned for seventeen years; and Abimelech the son of
   Sadoc was high priest. In his reign, the kingdom being divided,
   Jeroboam, of the tribe of Ephraim, the servant of Solomon, reigned in
   Samaria; and Achias the Shilonite continued to prophesy; also Samæas
   the son of Amame, and he who came from Judah to Jeroboam, [2046] and
   prophesied against the altar. After him his son Abijam, twenty-three
   years; and likewise his son Asaman. [2047] The last, in his old age,
   was diseased in his feet; and in his reign prophesied Jehu the son of
   Ananias.

   After him Jehosaphat his son reigned twenty-five years. [2048] In his
   reign prophesied Elias the Thesbite, and Michæas the son of Jebla, and
   Abdias the son of Ananias. And in the time of Michæas there was also
   the false prophet Zedekias, the son of Chonaan. These were followed by
   the reign of Joram the son of Jehosaphat, for eight years; during whose
   time prophesied Elias; and after Elias, Elisæus the son of Saphat. In
   his reign the people in Samaria ate doves' dung and their own children.
   The period of Jehosaphat extends from the close of the third book of
   Kings to the fourth. And in the reign of Joram, Elias was translated,
   and Elisæus the son of Saphat commenced prophesying, and prophesied for
   six years, being forty years old.

   Then Ochozias reigned a year. In his time Elisæus continued to
   prophesy, and along with him Adadonæus. [2049] After him the mother of
   Ozias, [2050] Gotholia, [2051] reigned eight [2052] years, having slain
   the children of her brother. [2053] For she was of the family of Ahab.
   But the sister of Ozias, Josabæa, stole Joas the son of Ozias, and
   invested him afterwards with the kingdom. And in the time of this
   Gotholia, Elisæus was still prophesying. And after her reigned, as I
   said before, Joash, rescued by Josabæa the wife of Jodæ the high
   priest, and lived in all forty years.

   There are comprised, then, from Solomon to the death of Elisæus the
   prophet, as some say, one hundred and five years; according to others,
   one hundred and two; and, as the chronology before us shows, from the
   reign of Solomon an hundred and eighty-one.

   Now from the Trojan war to the birth of Homer, according to
   Philochorus, a hundred and eighty years elapsed; and he was posterior
   to the Ionic migration. But Aristarchus, in the Archilochian Memoirs,
   says that he lived during the Ionic migration, which took place a
   hundred and twenty years after the siege of Troy. But Apollodorus
   alleges it was an hundred and twenty years after the Ionic migration,
   while Agesilaus son of Doryssæus was king of the Lacedæmonians: so that
   he brings Lycurgus the legislator, while still a young man, near him.
   Euthymenes, in the Chronicles, says that he flourished
   contemporaneously with Hesiod, in the time of Acastus, and was born in
   Chios about the four hundredth year after the capture of Troy. And
   Archimachus, in the third book of his Euboean History, is of this
   opinion. So that both he and Hesiod were later than Elisæus, the
   prophet. And if you choose to follow the grammarian Crates, and say
   that Homer was born about the time of the expedition of the Heraclidæ,
   eighty years after the taking of Troy, he will be found to be later
   again than Solomon, in whose days occurred the arrival of Menelaus in
   Phoenicia, as was said above. Eratosthenes says that Homer's age was
   two hundred years after the capture of Troy. Further, Theopompus, in
   the forty-third book of the Philippics, relates that Homer was born
   five hundred years after the war at Troy. And Euphorion, in his book
   about the Aleuades, maintains that he was born in the time of Gyges,
   who began to reign in the eighteenth Olympiad, who, also he says, was
   the first that was called tyrant (turannos). Sosibius Lacon, again, in
   his Record of Dates, brings Homer down to the eighth year of the reign
   of Charillus the son of Polydectus. Charillus reigned for sixty-four
   years, after whom the son of Nicander reigned thirty-nine years. In his
   thirty-fourth year it is said that the first Olympiad was instituted;
   so that Homer was ninety years before the introduction of the Olympic
   games.

   After Joas, Amasias his son reigned as his successor thirty-nine years.
   He in like manner was succeeded by his son Ozias, who reigned for
   fifty-two years, and died a leper. And in his time prophesied Amos, and
   Isaiah his son, [2054] and Hosea the son of Beeri, and Jonas the son of
   Amathi, who was of Geth-chober, who preached to the Ninevites, and
   passed through the whale's belly.

   Then Jonathan the son of Ozias reigned for sixteen years. In his time
   Esaias still prophesied, and Hosea, and Michæas the Morasthite, and
   Joel the son of Bethuel.

   Next in succession was his son Ahaz, who reigned for sixteen years. In
   his time, in the fifteenth year, Israel was carried away to Babylon.
   And Salmanasar the king of the Assyrians carried away the people of
   Samaria into the country of the Medes and to Babylon.

   Again Ahaz was succeeded by Osee, [2055] who reigned for eight years.
   Then followed Hezekiah, for twenty-nine years. For his sanctity, when
   he had approached his end, God, by Isaiah, allowed him to live for
   other fifteen years, giving as a sign the going back of the sun. Up to
   his times Esaias, Hosea, and Micah continued prophesying.

   And these are said to have lived after the age of Lycurgus, the
   legislator of the Lacedæmonians. For Dieuchidas, in the fourth book of
   the Megarics, places the era of Lycurgus about the two hundred and
   ninetieth year after the capture of Troy.

   After Hezekiah, his son Manasses reigned for fifty-five years. Then his
   son Amos for two years. After him reigned his son Josias, distinguished
   for his observance of the law, for thirty-one years. He "laid the
   carcases of men upon the carcases of the idols," as is written in the
   book of Leviticus. [2056] In his reign, in the eighteenth year, the
   passover was celebrated, not having been kept from the days of Samuel
   in the intervening period. [2057] Then Chelkias the priest, the father
   of the prophet Jeremiah, having fallen in with the book of the law,
   that had been laid up in the temple, read it and died. [2058] And in
   his days Olda [2059] prohesied, and Sophonias, [2060] and Jeremiah. And
   in the days of Jeremiah was Ananias the son of Azor, [2061] the false
   prophet. He [2062] having disobeyed Jeremiah the prophet, was slain by
   Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt at the river Euphrates, having encountered
   the latter, who was marching on the Assyrians.

   Josiah was succeeded by Jechoniah, called also Joachas, [2063] his son,
   who reigned three months and ten days. Necho king of Egypt bound him
   and led him to Egypt, after making his brother Joachim king in his
   stead, who continued his tributary for eleven years. After him his
   namesake [2064] Joakim reigned for three months. Then Zedekiah reigned
   for eleven years; and up to his time Jeremiah continued to prophesy.
   Along with him Ezekiel [2065] the son of Buzi, and Urias [2066] the son
   of Samæus, and Ambacum [2067] prophesied. Here end the Hebrew kings.

   There are then from the birth of Moses till this captivity nine hundred
   and seventy-two years; but according to strict chronological accuracy,
   one thousand and eighty-five, six months, ten days. From the reign of
   David to the captivity by the Chaldeans, four hundred and fifty-two
   years and six months; but as the accuracy we have observed in reference
   to dates makes out, four hundred and eighty-two and six months ten
   days.

   And in the twelfth year of the reign of Zedekiah, forty years before
   the supremacy of the Persians, Nebuchodonosor made war against the
   Phoenicians and the Jews, as Berosus asserts in his Chaldæan Histories.
   And Joabas, [2068] writing about the Assyrians, acknowledges that he
   had received the history from Berosus, and testifies to his accuracy.
   Nebuchodonosor, therefore, having put out the eyes of Zedekiah, took
   him away to Babylon, and transported the whole people (the captivity
   lasted seventy years), with the exception of a few who fled to Egypt.

   Jeremiah and Ambacum were still prophesying in the time of Zedekiah. In
   the fifth year of his reign Ezekiel prophesied at Babylon; after him
   Nahum, then Daniel. After him, again, Haggai and Zechariah prophesied
   in the time of Darius the First for two years; and then the angel among
   the twelve. [2069] After Haggai and Zechariah, Nehemiah, the chief
   cup-bearer of Artaxerxes, the son of Acheli the Israelite, built the
   city of Jerusalem and restored the temple. During the captivity lived
   Esther and Mordecai, whose book is still extant, as also that of the
   Maccabees. During this captivity Mishael, Ananias, and Azarias,
   refusing to worship the image, and being thrown into a furnace of fire,
   were saved by the appearance of an angel. At that time, on account of
   the serpent, [2070] Daniel was thrown into the den of lions; but being
   preserved through the providence of God by Ambacub, he is restored on
   the seventh day. At this period, too, occurred the sign of Jona; and
   Tobias, through the assistance of the angel Raphael, married Sarah, the
   demon having killed her seven first suitors; and after the marriage of
   Tobias, his father Tobit recovered his sight. At that time Zorobabel,
   having by his wisdom overcome his opponents, and obtained leave from
   Darius for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, returned with Esdras to his
   native land; and by him the redemption of the people and the revisal
   and restoration of the inspired oracles were effected; and the passover
   of deliverance celebrated, and marriage with aliens dissolved.

   Cyrus had, by proclamation, previously enjoined the restoration of the
   Hebrews. And his promise being accomplished in the time of Darius, the
   feast of the dedication was held, as also the feast of tabernacles.

   There were in all, taking in the duration of the captivity down to the
   restoration of the people, from the birth of Moses, one thousand one
   hundred and fifty-five years, six months, and ten days; and from the
   reign of David, according to some, four hundred and fifty-two; more
   correctly, five hundred and seventy-two years, six months, and ten
   days.

   From the captivity at Babylon, which took place in the time of Jeremiah
   the prophet, was fulfilled what was spoken by Daniel the prophet as
   follows: "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy
   holy city, to finish the transgression, and to seal sins, and to wipe
   out and make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
   righteousness, and to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint
   the Holy of Holies. Know therefore, and understand, that from the going
   forth of the word commanding an answer to be given, and Jerusalem to be
   built, to Christ the Prince, are seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; and
   the street shall be again built, and the wall; and the times shall be
   expended. And after the sixty-two weeks the anointing shall be
   overthrown, and judgment shall not be in him; and he shall destroy the
   city and the sanctuary along with the coming Prince. And they shall be
   destroyed in a flood, and to the end of the war shall be cut off by
   desolations. And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week;
   and in the middle of the week the sacrifice and oblation shall be taken
   away; and in the holy place shall be the abomination of desolations,
   and until the consummation of time shall the consummation be assigned
   for desolation. And in the midst of the week shall he make the incense
   of sacrifice cease, and of the wing of destruction, even till the
   consummation, like the destruction of the oblation." [2071] That the
   temple accordingly was built in seven weeks, is evident; for it is
   written in Esdras. And thus Christ became King of the Jews, reigning in
   Jerusalem in the fulfilment of the seven weeks. And in the sixty and
   two weeks the whole of Judæa was quiet, and without wars. And Christ
   our Lord, "the Holy of Holies," having come and fulfilled the vision
   and the prophecy, was anointed in His flesh by the Holy Spirit of His
   Father. In those "sixty and two weeks," as the prophet said, and "in
   the one week," was He Lord. The half of the week Nero held sway, and in
   the holy city Jerusalem placed the abomination; and in the half of the
   week he was taken away, and Otho, and Galba, and Vitellius. And
   Vespasian rose to the supreme power, and destroyed Jerusalem, and
   desolated the holy place. And that such are the facts of the case, is
   clear to him that is able to understand, as the prophet said.

   On the completion, then, of the eleventh year, in the beginning of the
   following, in the reign of Joachim, occurred the carrying away captive
   to Babylon by Nabuchodonosor the king, in the seventh year of his reign
   over the Assyrians, in the second year of the reign of Vaphres over the
   Egyptians, in the archonship of Philip at Athens, in the first year of
   the forty-eighth Olympiad. The captivity lasted for seventy years, and
   ended in the second year of Darius Hystaspes, who had become king of
   the Persians, Assyrians, and Egyptians; in whose reign, as I said
   above, Haggai and Zechariah and the angel of the twelve prophesied. And
   the high priest was Joshua the son of Josedec. And in the second year
   of the reign of Darius, who, Herodotus says, destroyed the power of the
   Magi, Zorobabel the son of Salathiel was despatched to raise and adorn
   the temple at Jerusalem.

   The times of the Persians are accordingly summed up thus: Cyrus reigned
   thirty years; Cambyses, nineteen; Darius, forty-six; Xerxes,
   twenty-six; Artaxerxes, forty-one; Darius, eight; Artaxerxes,
   forty-two; Ochus or Arses, three. The sum total of the years of the
   Persian monarchy is two hundred and thirty-five years.

   Alexander of Macedon, having despatched this Darius, during this
   period, began to reign. Similarly, therefore, the times of the
   Macedonian kings are thus computed: Alexander, eighteen years; Ptolemy
   the son of Lagus, forty years; Ptolemy Philadelphus, twenty-seven
   years; then Euergetes, five-and-twenty years; then Philopator,
   seventeen years; then Epiphanes, four-and-twenty years; he was
   succeeded by Philometer, who reigned five-and-thirty years; after him
   Physcon, twenty-nine years; then Lathurus, thirty-six years; then he
   that was surnamed Dionysus, twenty-nine years; and last Cleopatra
   reigned twenty-two years. And after her was the reign of the
   Cappadocians for eighteen days.

   Accordingly the period embraced by the Macedonian kings is, in all,
   three hundred and twelve years and eighteen days.

   Therefore those who prophesied in the time of Darius Hystaspes, about
   the second year of his reign,--Haggai, and Zechariah, and the angel of
   the twelve, who prophesied about the first year of the forty-eighth
   Olympiad,--are demonstrated to be older than Pythagoras, who is said to
   have lived in the sixty-second Olympiad, and than Thales, the oldest of
   the wise men of the Greeks, who lived about the fiftieth Olympiad.
   Those wise men that are classed with Thales were then contemporaneous,
   as Andron says in the Tripos. For Heraclitus being posterior to
   Pythagoras, mentions him in his book. Whence indisputably the first
   Olympiad, which was demonstrated to be four hundred and seven years
   later than the Trojan war, is found to be prior to the age of the
   above-mentioned prophets, together with those called the seven wise
   men. Accordingly it is easy to perceive that Solomon, who lived in the
   time of Menelaus (who was during the Trojan war), was earlier by many
   years than the wise men among the Greeks. And how many years Moses
   preceded him we showed, in what we said above. And Alexander, surnamed
   Polyhistor, in his work on the Jews, has transcribed some letters of
   Solomon to Vaphres king of Egypt, and to the king of the Phoenicians at
   Tyre, and theirs to Solomon; in which it is shown that Vaphres sent
   eighty thousand Egyptian men to him for the building of the temple, and
   the other as many, along with a Tyrian artificer, the son of a Jewish
   mother, of the tribe of Dan, [2072] as is there written, of the name of
   Hyperon. [2073] Further, Onomacritus the Athenian, who is said to have
   been the author of the poems ascribed to Orpheus, is ascertained to
   have lived in the reign of the Pisistratidæ, about the fiftieth
   Olympiad. And Orpheus, who sailed with Hercules, was the pupil of
   Musæus. Amphion precedes the Trojan war by two generations. And
   Demodocus and Phemius were posterior to the capture of Troy; for they
   were famed for playing on the lyre, the former among the Phæacians, and
   the latter among the suitors. And the Oracles ascribed to Musæus are
   said to be the production of Onomacritus, and the Crateres of Orpheus
   the production of Zopyrus of Heraclea, and The Descent to Hades that of
   Prodicus of Samos. Ion of Chios relates in the Triagmi, [2074] that
   Pythagoras ascribed certain works [of his own] to Orpheus. Epigenes, in
   his book respecting The Poetry attributed to Orpheus, says that The
   Descent to Hades and the Sacred Discourse were the production of
   Cecrops the Pythagorean; and the Peplus and the Physics of Brontinus.
   Some also make Terpander out ancient. Hellanicus, accordingly, relates
   that he lived in the time of Midas: but Phanias, who places Lesches the
   Lesbian before Terpander, makes Terpander younger than Archilochus, and
   relates that Lesches contended with Arctinus, and gained the victory.
   Xanthus the Lydian says that he lived about the eighteenth Olympiad; as
   also Dionysius says that Thasus was built about the fifteenth Olympiad:
   so that it is clear that Archilochus [2075] was already known after the
   twentieth Olympiad. He accordingly relates the destruction of Magnetes
   as having recently taken place. Simonides is assigned to the time of
   Archilochus. Callinus is not much older; for Archilochus refers to
   Magnetes as destroyed, while the latter refers to it as flourishing.
   Eumelus of Corinth being older, is said to have met Archias, who
   founded Syracuse.

   We were induced to mention these things, because the poets of the epic
   cycle are placed amongst those of most remote antiquity. Already, too,
   among the Greeks, many diviners are said to have made their appearance,
   as the Bacides, one a Boeotian, the other an Arcadian, who uttered many
   predictions to many. By the counsel of Amphiletus the Athenian, [2076]
   who showed the time for the onset, Pisistratus, too, strengthened his
   government. For we may pass over in silence Cometes of Crete, Cinyras
   of Cyprus, Admetus the Thessalian, Aristæas the Cyrenian, Amphiaraus
   the Athenian, Timoxeus [2077] the Corcyræan, Demænetus the Phocian,
   Epigenes the Thespian, Nicias the Carystian, Aristo the Thessalian,
   Dionysius the Carthaginian, Cleophon the Corinthian, Hippo the daughter
   of Chiro, and Boeo, and Manto, and the host of Sibyls, the Samian, the
   Colophonian, the Cumæan, the Erythræan, the Pythian, [2078] the
   Taraxandrian, the Macetian, the Thessalian, and the Thesprotian. And
   Calchas again, and Mopsus, who lived during the Trojan war. Mopsus,
   however, was older, having sailed along with the Argonants. And it is
   said that Battus the Cyrenian composed what is called the Divination of
   Mopsus. Dorotheus in the first Pandect relates that Mopsus was the
   disciple of Alcyon and Corone. And Pythagoras the Great always applied
   his mind to prognostication, and Abaris the Hyperborean, and Aristæas
   the Proconnesian, and Epimenides the Cretan, who came to Sparta, and
   Zoroaster the Mede, and Empedocles of Agrigentum, and Phormion the
   Lacedæmonian; Polyaratus, too, of Thasus, and Empedotimus of Syracuse;
   and in addition to these, Socrates the Athenian in particular. "For,"
   he says in the Theages, "I am attended by a supernatural intimation,
   which has been assigned me from a child by divine appointment. This is
   a voice which, when it comes, prevents what I am about to do, but
   exhorts never." [2079] And Execestus, the tyrant of the Phocians, wore
   two enchanted rings, and by the sound which they uttered one against
   the other determined the proper times for actions. But he died,
   nevertheless, treacherously murdered, although warned beforehand by the
   sound, as Aristotle says in the Polity of the Phocians.

   Of those, too, who at one time lived as men among the Egyptians, but
   were constituted gods by human opinion, were Hermes the Theban, and
   Asclepius of Memphis; Tireseus and Manto, again, at Thebes, as
   Euripides says. Helenus, too, and Laocoön, and OEnone, and Crenus in
   Ilium. For Crenus, one of the Heraclidæ, is said to have been a noted
   prophet. Another was Jamus in Elis, from whom came the Jamidæ; and
   Polyidus at Argos and Megara, who is mentioned by the tragedy. Why
   enumerate Telemus, who, being a prophet of the Cyclops, predicted to
   Polyphemus the events of Ulysses' wandering; or Onomacritus at Athens;
   or Amphiaraus, who campaigned with the seven at Thebes, and is reported
   to be a generation older than the capture of Troy; or Theoclymenus in
   Cephalonia, or Telmisus in Caria, or Galeus in Sicily?

   There are others, too, besides these: Idmon, who was with the
   Argonauts, Phemonoe of Delphi, Mopsus the son of Apollo and Manto in
   Pamphylia, and Amphilochus the son of Amphiaraus in Cilicia, Alcmæon
   among the Acarnanians, Anias in Delos, Aristander of Telmessus, who was
   along with Alexander. Philochorus also relates in the first book of the
   work, On Divination, that Orpheus was a seer. And Theopompus, and
   Ephorus, and Timæus, write of a seer called Orthagoras; as the Samian
   Pythocles in the fourth book of The Italics writes of Caius Julius
   Nepos.

   But some of these "thieves and robbers," as the Scripture says,
   predicted for the most part from observation and probabilities, as
   physicians and soothsayers judge from natural signs; and others were
   excited by demons, or were disturbed by waters, and fumigations, and
   air of a peculiar kind. But among the Hebrews the prophets were moved
   by the power and inspiration of God. Before the law, Adam spoke
   prophetically in respect to the woman, and the naming of the creatures;
   Noah preached repentance; [2080] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob gave many
   clear utterances respecting future and present things. Contemporaneous
   with the law, Moses and Aaron; and after these prophesied Jesus the son
   of Nave, Samuel, Gad, Nathan, Achias, Samæas, Jehu, Elias, Michæas,
   Abdiu, Elisæus, Abbadonai, Amos, Esaias, Osee, Jonas, Joel, Jeremias,
   Sophonias the son of Buzi, Ezekiel, Urias, Ambacum, Naum, Daniel,
   Misael, who wrote the syllogisms, Aggai, Zacharias, and the angel among
   the twelve. These are, in all, five-and-thirty prophets. And of women
   (for these too prophesied), Sara, and Rebecca, and Mariam, and Debbora,
   and Olda, i.e., Huldah.

   Then within the same period John prophesied till the baptism of
   salvation; [2081] and after the birth of Christ, Anna and Simeon.
   [2082] For Zacaharias, John's father, is said in the Gospels to have
   prophesied before his son. Let us then draw up the chronology of the
   Greeks from Moses.

   From the birth of Moses to the exodus of the Jews from Egypt, eighty
   years; and the period down to his death, other forty years. The exodus
   took place in the time of Inachus, before the wandering of Sothis,
   [2083] Moses having gone forth from Egypt three hundred and forty-five
   years before. From the rule of Moses, and from Inachus to the flood of
   Deucalion, I mean the second inundation, and to the conflagration of
   Phaethon, which events happened in the time of Crotopus, forty
   generations are enumerated (three generations being reckoned for a
   century). From the flood to the conflagration of Ida, and the discovery
   of iron, and the Idæan Dactyls, are seventy-three years, according to
   Thrasyllus; and from the conflagration of Ida to the rape of Ganymede,
   sixty-five years. From this to the expedition of Perseus, when Glaucus
   established the Isthmian games in honour of Melicerta, fifteen years;
   and from the expedition of Perseus to the building of Troy, thirty-four
   years. From this to the voyage of the Argo, sixty-four years. From this
   to Theseus and the Minotaur, thirty-two years; then to the seven at
   Thebes, ten years. And to the Olympic contest, which Hercules
   instituted in honour of Pelops, three years; and to the expedition of
   the Amazons against Athens, and the rape of Helen by Theseus, nine
   years. From this to the deification of Hercules, eleven years; then to
   the rape of Helen by Alexander, four years. From the taking of Troy to
   the descent of Æneas and the founding of Lavinium, ten years; and to
   the government of Ascanius, eight years; and to the descent of the
   Heraclidæ, sixty-one years; and to the Olympiad of Iphitus, three
   hundred and thirty-eight years. Eratosthenes thus sets down the dates:
   "From the capture of Troy to the descent of the Heraclidæ, eighty
   years. From this to the founding of Ionia, sixty years; and the period
   following to the protectorate of Lycurgus, a hundred and fifty-nine
   years; and to the first year of the first Olympiad, a hundred and eight
   years. From which Olympiad to the invasion of Xerxes, two hundred and
   ninety-seven years; from which to the beginning of the Peloponnesian
   war, forty-eight years; and to its close, and the defeat of the
   Athenians, twenty-seven years; and to the battle at Leuctra,
   thirty-four years; after which to the death of Philip, thirty-five
   years. And after this to the decease of Alexander, twelve years."

   Again, from the first Olympiad, some say, to the building of Rome, are
   comprehended twenty-four years; and after this to the expulsion of the
   kings, [2084] when consuls were created, about two hundred and
   forty-three years. And from the taking of Babylon to the death of
   Alexander, a hundred and eighty-six years. From this to the victory of
   Augustus, when Antony killed himself at Alexandria, two hundred and
   ninety-four years, when Augustus was made consul for the fourth time.
   And from this time to the games which Domitian instituted at Rome, are
   a hundred and fourteen years; and from the first games to the death of
   Commodus, a hundred and eleven years.

   There are some that from Cecrops to Alexander of Macedon reckon a
   thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight years; and from Demophon, a
   thousand two hundred and fifty; and from the taking of Troy to the
   expedition of the Heraclidæ, a hundred and twenty or a hundred and
   eighty years. From this to the archonship of Evænetus at Athens, in
   whose time Alexander is said to have marched into Asia, according to
   Phanias, are seven hundred and fifty years; according to Ephorus, seven
   hundred and thirty-five; according to Timæus and Clitarchus, eight
   hundred and twenty; according to Eratosthenes, seven hundred and
   seventy-four. As also Duris, from the taking of Troy to the march of
   Alexander into Asia, a thousand years; and from that to the archonship
   of Hegesias, in whose time Alexander died eleven years. From this date
   to the reign of Germanicus Claudius Cæsar, three hundred and sixty-five
   years. From which time the years summed up to the death of Commodus are
   manifest.

   After the Grecian period, and in accordance with the dates, as computed
   by the barbarians, very large intervals are to be assigned.

   From Adam to the deluge are comprised two thousand one hundred and
   forty-eight years, four days. From Shem to Abraham, a thousand two
   hundred and fifty years. From Isaac to the division of the land, six
   hundred and sixteen years. Then from the judges to Samuel, four hundred
   and sixty-three years, seven months. And after the judges there were
   five hundred and seventy-two years, six months, ten days of kings.

   After which periods, there were two hundred and thirty-five years of
   the Persian monarchy. Then of the Macedonian, till the death of Antony,
   three hundred and twelve years and eighteen days. After which time, the
   empire of the Romans, till the death of Commodus, lasted for two
   hundred and twenty-two years.

   Then, from the seventy years' captivity, and the restoration of the
   people into their own land to the captivity in the time of Vespasian,
   are comprised four hundred and ten years. Finally, from Vespasian to
   the death of Commodus, there are ascertained to be one hundred and
   twenty-one years, six months, and twenty-four days.

   Demetrius, in his book, On the Kings in Judæa, says that the tribes of
   Juda, Benjamin, and Levi were not taken captive by Sennacherim; but
   that there were from this captivity to the last, which Nabuchodonosor
   made out of Jerusalem, a hundred and twenty-eight years and six months;
   and from the time that the ten tribes were carried captive from Samaria
   till Ptolemy the Fourth, were five hundred and seventy-three years,
   nine months; and from the time that the captivity from Jerusalem took
   place, three hundred and thirty-eight years and three months.

   Philo himself set down the kings differently from Demetrius.

   Besides, Eupolemus, in a similar work, says that all the years from
   Adam to the fifth year of Ptolemy Demetrius, who reigned twelve years
   in Egypt, when added, amount to five thousand a hundred and forty-nine;
   and from the time that Moses brought out the Jews from Egypt to the
   above-mentioned date, there are, in all, two thousand five hundred and
   eighty years. And from this time till the consulship in Rome of Caius
   Domitian and Casian, a hundred and twenty years are computed.

   Euphorus and many other historians say that there are seventy-five
   nations and tongues, in consequence of hearing the statement made by
   Moses: "All the souls that sprang from Jacob, which went down into
   Egypt, were seventy-five." [2085] According to the true reckoning,
   there appear to be seventy-two generic dialects, as our Scriptures hand
   down. The rest of the vulgar tongues are formed by the blending of two,
   or three, or more dialects. A dialect is a mode of speech which
   exhibits a character peculiar to a locality, or a mode of speech which
   exhibits a character peculiar or common to a race. The Greeks say, that
   among them are five dialects--the Attic, Ionic, Doric, Æolic, and the
   fifth the Common; and that the languages of the barbarians, which are
   innumerable, are not called dialects, but tongues.

   Plato attributes a dialect also to the gods, forming this conjecture
   mainly from dreams and oracles, and especially from demoniacs, who do
   not speak their own language or dialect, but that of the demons who
   have taken possession of them. He thinks also that the irrational
   creatures have dialects, which those that belong to the same genus
   understand. [2086] Accordingly, when an elephant falls into the mud and
   bellows out any other one that is at hand, on seeing what has happened,
   shortly turns, and brings with him a herd of elephants, and saves the
   one that has fallen in. It is said also in Libya, that a scorpion, if
   it does not succeed in stinging a man, goes away and returns with
   several more; and that, hanging on one to the other like a chain they
   make in this way the attempt to succeed in their cunning design.

   The irrational creatures do not make use of an obscure intimation, or
   hint their meaning by assuming a particular attitude, but, as I think,
   by a dialect of their own. [2087] And some others say, that if a fish
   which has been taken escape by breaking the line, no fish of the same
   kind will be caught in the same place that day. But the first and
   generic barbarous dialects have terms by nature, since also men confess
   that prayers uttered in a barbarian tongue are more powerful. And
   Plato, in the Cratylus, when wishing to interpret pur (fire), says that
   it is a barbaric term. He testifies, accordingly, that the Phrygians
   use this term with a slight deviation.

   And nothing, in my opinion, after these details, need stand in the way
   of stating the periods of the Roman emperors, in order to the
   demonstration of the Saviour's birth. Augustus, forty-three years;
   Tiberius, twenty-two years; Caius, four years; Claudius, fourteen
   years; Nero, fourteen years; Galba, one year; Vespasian, ten years;
   Titus, three years; Domitian, fifteen years; Nerva, one year; Trajan,
   nineteen years; Adrian, twenty-one years; Antoninus, twenty-one years;
   likewise again, Antoninus and Commodus, thirty-two. In all, from
   Augustus to Commodus, are two hundred and twenty-two years; and from
   Adam to the death of Commodus, five thousand seven hundred and
   eighty-four years, two months, twelve days.

   Some set down the dates of the Roman emperors thus:--

   Caius Julius Cæsar, three years, four months, five days; after him
   Augustus reigned forty-six years, four months, one day. Then Tiberius,
   twenty-six years, six months, nineteen days. He was succeeded by Caius
   Cæsar, who reigned three years, ten months, eight days; and he by
   Claudius for thirteen years, eight months, twenty-eight days. Nero
   reigned thirteen years, eight months, twenty-eight days; Galba, seven
   months and six days; Otho, five months, one day; Vitellius, seven
   months, one day; Vespasian, eleven years, eleven months, twenty-two
   days; Titus, two years, two months; Domitian, fifteen years, eight
   months, five days; Nerva, one year, four months, ten days; Trajan,
   nineteen years, seven months, ten days; Adrian, twenty years, ten
   months, twenty-eight days. Antoninus, twenty-two years, three months,
   and seven days; Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, nineteen years, eleven days;
   Commodus, twelve years, nine months, fourteen days.

   From Julius Cæsar, therefore, to the death of Commodus, are two hundred
   and thirty-six years, six months. And the whole from Romulus, who
   founded Rome, till the death of Commodus, amounts to nine hundred and
   fifty-three years, six months. And our Lord was born in the
   twenty-eighth year, when first the census was ordered to be taken in
   the reign of Augustus. And to prove that this is true, it is written in
   the Gospel by Luke as follows: "And in the fifteenth year, in the reign
   of Tiberius Cæsar, the word of the Lord came to John, the son of
   Zacharias." And again in the same book: "And Jesus was coming to His
   baptism, being about thirty years old," [2088] and so on. And that it
   was necessary for Him to preach only a year, this also is written:
   [2089] "He hath sent Me to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."
   This both the prophet spake, and the Gospel. Accordingly, in fifteen
   years of Tiberius and fifteen years of Augustus; so were completed the
   thirty years till the time He suffered. And from the time that He
   suffered till the destruction of Jerusalem are forty-two years and
   three months; and from the destruction of Jerusalem to the death of
   Commodus, a hundred and twenty-eight years, ten months, and three days.
   From the birth of Christ, therefore, to the death of Commodus are, in
   all, a hundred and ninety-four years, one month, thirteen days. And
   there are those who have determined not only the year of our Lord's
   birth, but also the day; and they say that it took place in the
   twenty-eighth year of Augustus, and in the twenty-fifth day of Pachon.
   And the followers of Basilides hold the day of his baptism as a
   festival, spending the night before in readings.

   And they say that it was the fifteenth year of Tiberius Cæsar, the
   fifteenth day of the month Tubi; and some that it was the eleventh of
   the same month. And treating of His passion, with very great accuracy,
   some say that it took place in the sixteenth year of Tiberius, on the
   twenty-fifth of Phamenoth; and others the twenty-fifth of Pharmuthi and
   others say that on the nineteenth of Pharmuthi the Saviour suffered.
   Further, others say that He was born on the twenty-fourth or
   twenty-fifth of Pharmuthi. [2090]

   We have still to add to our chronology the following,--I mean the days
   which Daniel indicates from the desolation of Jerusalem, the seven
   years and seven months of the reign of Vespasian. For the two years are
   added to the seventeen months and eighteen days of Otho, and Galba, and
   Vitellius; and the result is three years and six months, which is "the
   half of the week," as Daniel the prophet said. For he said that there
   were two thousand three hundred days from the time that the abomination
   of Nero stood in the holy city, till its destruction. For thus the
   declaration, which is subjoined, shows: "How long shall be the vision,
   the sacrifice taken away, the abomination of desolation, which is
   given, and the power and the holy place shall be trodden under foot?
   And he said to him, Till the evening and morning, two thousand three
   hundred days, and the holy place shall be taken away." [2091]

   These two thousand three hundred days, then, make six years four
   months, during the half of which Nero held sway, and it was half a
   week; and for a half, Vespasian with Otho, Galba, and Vitellius
   reigned. And on this account Daniel says, "Blessed is he that cometh to
   the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days." [2092] For up to
   these days was war, and after them it ceased. And this number is
   demonstrated from a subsequent chapter, which is as follows: "And from
   the time of the change of continuation, and of the giving of the
   abomination of desolation, there shall be a thousand two hundred and
   ninety days. Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand
   three hundred and thirty-five days." [2093]

   Flavius Josephus the Jew, who composed the history of the Jews,
   computing the periods, says that from Moses to David were five hundred
   and eighty-five years; from David to the second year of Vespasian, a
   thousand one hundred and seventy-nine; then from that to the tenth year
   of Antoninus, seventy-seven. So that from Moses to the tenth year of
   Antoninus there are, in all, two thousand one hundred and thirty-three
   years.

   Of others, counting from Inachus and Moses to the death of Commodus,
   some say there were three thousand one hundred and forty-two years; and
   others, two thousand eight hundred and thirty-one years.

   And in the Gospel according to Matthew, the genealogy which begins with
   Abraham is continued down to Mary the mother of the Lord. "For," it is
   said, [2094] "from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from
   David to the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and
   from the carrying away into Babylon till Christ are likewise other
   fourteen generations,"--three mystic intervals completed in six weeks.

      Chapter XXII.--On the Greek Translation of the Old Testament.

   So much for the details respecting dates, as stated variously by many,
   and as set down by us.

   It is said that the Scriptures both of the law and of the prophets were
   translated from the dialect of the Hebrews into the Greek language in
   the reign of Ptolemy the son of Lagos, or, according to others, of
   Ptolemy surnamed Philadelphus; Demetrius Phalereus bringing to this
   task the greatest earnestness, and employing painstaking accuracy on
   the materials for the translation. For the Macedonians being still in
   possession of Asia, and the king being ambitious of adorning the
   library he had at Alexandria with all writings, desired the people of
   Jerusalem to translate the prophecies they possessed into the Greek
   dialect. And they being the subjects of the Macedonians, selected from
   those of highest character among them seventy elders, versed in the
   Scriptures, and skilled in the Greek dialect, and sent them to him with
   the divine books. And each having severally translated each prophetic
   book, and all the translations being compared together, they agreed
   both in meaning and expression. For it was the counsel of God carried
   out for the benefit of Grecian ears. It was not alien to the
   inspiration of God, who gave the prophecy, also to produce the
   translation, and make it as it were Greek prophecy. Since the
   Scriptures having perished in the captivity of Nabuchodonosor, Esdras
   [2096] the Levite, the priest, in the time of Artaxerxes king of the
   Persians, having become inspired in the exercise of prophecy restored
   again the whole of the ancient Scriptures. And Aristobulus, in his
   first book addressed to Philometor, writes in these words: "And Plato
   followed the laws given to us, and had manifestly studied all that is
   said in them." And before Demetrius there had been translated by
   another, previous to the dominion of Alexander and of the Persians, the
   account of the departure of our countrymen the Hebrews from Egypt, and
   the fame of all that happened to them, and their taking possession of
   the land, and the account of the whole code of laws; so that it is
   perfectly clear that the above-mentioned philosopher derived a great
   deal from this source, for he was very learned, as also Pythagoras, who
   transferred many things from our books to his own system of doctrines.
   And Numenius, the Pythagorean philosopher, expressly writes: "For what
   is Plato, but Moses speaking in Attic Greek?" This Moses was a
   theologian and prophet, and as some say, an interpreter of sacred laws.
   His family, his deeds, and life, are related by the Scriptures
   themselves, which are worthy of all credit; but have nevertheless to be
   stated by us also as well as we can. [2097]

      Chapter XXIII.--The Age, Birth, and Life of Moses.

   Moses, originally of a Chaldean [2098] family, was born in Egypt, his
   ancestors having migrated from Babylon into Egypt on account of a
   protracted famine. Born in the seventh generation, [2099] and having
   received a royal education, the following are the circumstances of his
   history. The Hebrews having increased in Egypt to a great multitude,
   and the king of the country being afraid of insurrection in consequence
   of their numbers, he ordered all the female children born to the
   Hebrews to be reared (woman being unfit for war), but the male to be
   destroyed, being suspicious of stalwart youth. But the child being
   goodly, his parents nursed him secretly three months, natural affection
   being too strong for the monarch's cruelty. But at last, dreading lest
   they should be destroyed along with the child, they made a basket of
   the papyrus that grew there, put the child in it, and laid it on the
   banks of the marshy river. The child's sister stood at a distance, and
   watched what would happen. In this emergency, the king's daughter, who
   for a long time had not been pregnant, and who longed for a child, came
   that day to the river to bathe and wash herself; and hearing the child
   cry, she ordered it to be brought to her; and touched with pity, sought
   a nurse. At that moment the child's sister ran up, and said that, if
   she wished, she could procure for her as nurse one of the Hebrew women
   who had recently had a child. And on her consenting and desiring her to
   do so, she brought the child's mother to be nurse for a stipulated fee,
   as if she had been some other person. Thereupon the queen gave the babe
   the name of Moses, with etymological propriety, from his being drawn
   out of "the water," [2100] --for the Egyptians call water "mou,"--in
   which he had been exposed to die. For they call Moses one who "who
   breathed [on being taken] from the water." It is clear that previously
   the parents gave a name to the child on his circumcision; and he was
   called Joachim. And he had a third name in heaven, after his ascension,
   [2101] as the mystics say--Melchi. Having reached the proper age, he
   was taught arithmetic, geometry, poetry, harmony, and besides, medicine
   and music, by those that excelled in these arts among the Egyptians;
   and besides, the philosophy which is conveyed by symbols, which they
   point out in the hieroglyphical inscriptions. The rest of the usual
   course of instruction, Greeks taught him in Egypt as a royal child, as
   Philo says in his life of Moses. He learned, besides, the literature of
   the Egyptians, and the knowledge of the heavenly bodies from the
   Chaldeans and the Egyptians; whence in the Acts [2102] he is said "to
   have been instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians." And
   Eupolemus, in his book On the Kings in Judea, says that "Moses was the
   first wise man, and the first that imparted grammar to the Jews, that
   the Phoenicians received it from the Jews, and the Greeks from the
   Phoenicians." And betaking himself to their philosophy, [2103] he
   increased his wisdom, being ardently attached to the training received
   from his kindred and ancestors, till he struck and slew the Egyptian
   who wrongfully attacked the Hebrew. And the mystics say that he slew
   the Egyptian by a word only; as, certainly, Peter in the Acts is
   related to have slain by speech those who appropriated part of the
   price of the field, and lied. [2104] And so Artapanus, in his work On
   the Jews, relates "that Moses, being shut up in custody by Chenephres,
   king of the Egyptians, on account of the people demanding to be let go
   from Egypt, the prison being opened by night, by the interposition of
   God, went forth, and reaching the palace, stood before the king as he
   slept, and aroused him; and that the latter, struck with what had taken
   place, bade Moses tell him the name of the God who had sent him; and
   that he, bending forward, told him in his ear; and that the king on
   hearing it fell speechless, but being supported by Moses, revived
   again." And respecting the education of Moses, we shall find a
   harmonious account in Ezekiel, [2105] the composer of Jewish tragedies
   in the drama entitled The Exodus. He thus writes in the person of
   Moses:--


   "For, seeing our race abundantly increase,

   His treacherous snares King Pharaoh 'gainst us laid,

   And cruelly in brick-kilns some of us,

   And some, in toilsome works of building, plagued.

   And towns and towers by toil of ill-starred men

   He raised. Then to the Hebrew race proclaimed,

   That each male child should in deep-flowing Nile

   Be drowned. My mother bore and hid me then

   Three months (so afterwards she told). Then took,

   And me adorned with fair array, and placed

   On the deep sedgy marsh by Nilus bank,

   While Miriam, my sister, watched afar.

   Then, with her maids, the daughter of the king,

   To bathe her beauty in the cleansing stream,

   Came near, straight saw, and took and raised me up;

   And knew me for a Hebrew. Miriam

   My sister to the princess ran, and said,

   Is it thy pleasure, that I haste and find

   A nurse for thee to rear this child

   Among the Hebrew women?' The princess

   Gave assent. The maiden to her mother sped,

   And told, who quick appeared. My own

   Dear mother took me in her arms. Then said

   The daughter of the king: Nurse me this child,

   And I will give thee wages.' And my name

   Moses she called, because she drew and saved

   Me from the waters on the river's bank.

   And when the days of childhood had flown by,

   My mother brought me to the palace where

   The princess dwelt, after disclosing all

   About my ancestry, and God's great gifts.

   In boyhood's years I royal nurture had,

   And in all princely exercise was trained,

   As if the princess's very son. But when

   The circling days had run their course,

   I left the royal palace."

   Then, after relating the combat between the Hebrew and the Egyptian,
   and the burying of the Egyptian in the sand, he says of the other
   contest:--


   "Why strike one feebler than thyself?

   And he rejoined: Who made thee judge o'er us,

   Or ruler? Wilt thou slay me, as thou didst

   Him yesterday? And I in terror said,

   How is this known?"

   Then he fled from Egypt and fed sheep, being thus trained beforehand
   for pastoral rule. For the shepherd's life is a preparation for
   sovereignty in the case of him who is destined to rule over the
   peaceful flock of men, as the chase for those who are by nature
   warlike. Thence God brought him to lead the Hebrews. Then the
   Egyptians, oft admonished, continued unwise; and the Hebrews were
   spectators of the calamities that others suffered, learning in safety
   the power of God. And when the Egyptians gave no heed to the effects of
   that power, through their foolish infatuation disbelieving, then, as is
   said, "the children knew" what was done; and the Hebrews afterwards
   going forth, departed carrying much spoil from the Egyptians, not for
   avarice, as the cavillers say, for God did not persuade them to covet
   what belonged to others. But, in the first place, they took wages for
   the services they had rendered the Egyptians all the time; and then in
   a way recompensed the Egyptians, by afflicting them in requital as
   avaricious, by the abstraction of the booty, as they had done the
   Hebrews by enslaving them. Whether, then, as may be alleged is done in
   war, they thought it proper, in the exercise of the rights of
   conquerors, to take away the property of their enemies, as those who
   have gained the day do from those who are worsted (and there was just
   cause of hostilities. The Hebrews came as suppliants to the Egyptians
   on account of famine; and they, reducing their guests to slavery,
   compelled them to serve them after the manner of captives, giving them
   no recompense); or as in peace, took the spoil as wages against the
   will of those who for a long period had given them no recompense, but
   rather had robbed them, [it is all one.]

      Chapter XXIV.--How Moses Discharged the Part of a Military Leader.

   Our Moses then is a prophet, a legislator, skilled in military tactics
   and strategy, a politician, a philosopher. And in what sense he was a
   prophet, shall be by and by told, when we come to treat of prophecy.
   Tactics belong to military command, and the ability to command an army
   is among the attributes of kingly rule. Legislation, again, is also one
   of the functions of the kingly office, as also judicial authority.

   Of the kingly office one kind is divine,--that which is according to
   God and His holy Son, by whom both the good things which are of the
   earth, and external and perfect felicity too, are supplied. "For," it
   is said, "seek what is great, and the little things shall be added."
   [2106] And there is a second kind of royalty, inferior to that
   administration which is purely rational and divine, which brings to the
   task of government merely the high mettle of the soul; after which
   fashion Hercules ruled the Argives, and Alexander the Macedonians. The
   third kind is what aims after one thing--merely to conquer and
   overturn; but to turn conquest either to a good or a bad purpose,
   belongs not to such rule. Such was the aim of the Persians in their
   campaign against Greece. For, on the one hand, fondness for strife is
   solely the result of passion, and acquires power solely for the sake of
   domination; while, on the other, the love of good is characteristic of
   a soul which uses its high spirit for noble ends. The fourth, the worst
   of all, is the sovereignty which acts according to the promptings of
   the passions, as that of Sardanapalus, and those who propose to
   themselves as their end the gratification of the passions to the
   utmost. But the instrument of regal sway--the instrument at once of
   that which overcomes by virtue, and that which does so by force--is the
   power of managing (or tact). And it varies according to the nature and
   the material. In the case of arms and of fighting animals the ordering
   power is the soul and mind, by means animate and inanimate; and in the
   case of the passions of the soul, which we master by virtue, reason is
   the ordering power, by affixing the seal of continence and
   self-restraint, along with holiness, and sound knowledge with truth,
   making the result of the whole to terminate in piety towards God. For
   it is wisdom which regulates in the case of those who so practice
   virtue; and divine things are ordered by wisdom, and human affairs by
   politics--all things by the kingly faculty. He is a king, then, who
   governs according to the laws, and possesses the skill to sway willing
   subjects. Such is the Lord, who receives all who believe on Him and by
   Him. For the Father has delivered and subjected all to Christ our King,
   "that at the name of Jesus every knee may bow, of things in heaven, and
   things in earth, and things under the earth, and every tongue confess
   that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." [2107]

   Now, generalship involves three ideas: caution, enterprise, and the
   union of the two. And each of these consists of three things, acting as
   they do either by word, or by deeds, or by both together. And all this
   can be accomplished either by persuasion, or by compulsion, or by
   inflicting harm in the way of taking vengeance on those who ought to be
   punished; and this either by doing what is right, or by telling what is
   untrue, or by telling what is true, or by adopting any of these means
   conjointly at the same time.

   Now, the Greeks had the advantage of receiving from Moses all these,
   and the knowledge of how to make use of each of them. And, for the sake
   of example, I shall cite one or two instances of leadership. Moses, on
   leading the people forth, suspecting that the Egyptians would pursue,
   left the short and direct route, and turned to the desert, and marched
   mostly by night. For it was another kind of arrangement by which the
   Hebrews were trained in the great wilderness, and for a protracted
   time, to belief in the existence of one God alone, being inured by the
   wise discipline of endurance to which they were subjected. The strategy
   of Moses, therefore, shows the necessity of discerning what will be of
   service before the approach of dangers, and so to encounter them. It
   turned out precisely as he suspected, for the Egyptians pursued with
   horses and chariots, but were quickly destroyed by the sea breaking on
   them and overwhelming them with their horses and chariots, so that not
   a remnant of them was left. Afterwards the pillar of fire, which
   accompanied them (for it went before them as a guide), conducted the
   Hebrews by night through an untrodden region, training and bracing
   them, by toils and hardships, to manliness and endurance, that after
   their experience of what appeared formidable difficulties, the benefits
   of the land, to which from the trackless desert he was conducting them,
   might become apparent. Furthermore, he put to flight and slew the
   hostile occupants of the land, falling upon them from a desert and
   rugged line of march (such was the excellence of his generalship). For
   the taking of the land of those hostile tribes was a work of skill and
   strategy.

   Perceiving this, Miltiades, the Athenian general, who conquered the
   Persians in battle at Marathon, imitated it in the following fashion.
   Marching over a trackless desert, he led on the Athenians by night, and
   eluded the barbarians that were set to watch him. For Hippias, who had
   deserted from the Athenians, conducted the barbarians into Attica, and
   seized and held the points of vantage, in consequence of having a
   knowledge of the ground. The task was then to elude Hippias. Whence
   rightly Miltiades, traversing the desert and attacking by night the
   Persians commanded by Dates, led his soldiers to victory.

   But further, when Thrasybulus was bringing back the exiles from Phyla,
   and wished to elude observation, a pillar became his guide as he
   marched over a trackless region. To Thrasybulus by night, the sky being
   moonless and stormy, a fire appeared leading the way, which, having
   conducted them safely, left them near Munychia, where is now the altar
   of the light-bringer (Phosphorus).

   From such an instance, therefore, let our accounts become credible to
   the Greeks, namely, that it was possible for the omnipotent God to make
   the pillar of fire, which was their guide on their march, go before the
   Hebrews by night. It is said also in a certain oracle,--


   "A pillar to the Thebans is joy-inspiring Bacchus,"

   from the history of the Hebrews. Also Euripides says, in Antiope,--


   "In the chambers within, the herdsman,

   With chaplet of ivy, pillar of the Evoean god."

   The pillar indicates that God cannot be portrayed. The pillar of light,
   too, in addition to its pointing out that God cannot be represented,
   shows also the stability and the permanent duration of the Deity, and
   His unchangeable and inexpressible light. Before, then, the invention
   of the forms of images, the ancients erected pillars, and reverenced
   them as statues of the Deity. Accordingly, he who composed the Phoronis
   writes,--


   "Callithoe, key-bearer of the Olympian queen:

   Argive Hera, who first with fillets and with fringes

   The queen's tall column all around adorned."

   Further, the author of Europia relates that the statue of Apollo at
   Delphi was a pillar in these words:--


   "That to the god first-fruits and tithes we may

   On sacred pillars and on lofty column hang."

   Apollo, interpreted mystically by "privation of many," [2108] means the
   one God. Well, then, that fire like a pillar, and the fire in the
   desert, is the symbol of the holy light which passed through from earth
   and returned again to heaven, by the wood [of the cross], by which also
   the gift of intellectual vision was bestowed on us.

      Chapter XXV.--Plato an Imitator of Moses in Framing Laws.

   Plato the philosopher, aided in legislation by the books of Moses,
   censured the polity of Minos, and that of Lycurgus, as having bravery
   alone as their aim; while he praised as more seemly the polity which
   expresses some one thing, and directs according to one precept. For he
   says that it becomes us to philosophize with strength, and dignity, and
   wisdom,--holding unalterably the same opinions about the same things,
   with reference to the dignity of heaven. Accordingly, therefore, he
   interprets what is in the law, enjoining us to look to one God and to
   do justly. Of politics, he says there are two kinds,--the department of
   law, and that of politics, strictly so called.

   And he refers to the Creator, as the Statesman (ho politikos) by way of
   eminence, in his book of this name (ho politikos); and those who lead
   an active and just life, combined with contemplation, he calls
   statesmen (politikoi). That department of politics which is called
   "Law," he divides into administrative magnanimity and private good
   order, which he calls orderliness; and harmony, and sobriety, which are
   seen when rulers suit their subjects, and subjects are obedient to
   their rulers; a result which the system of Moses sedulously aims at
   effecting. Further, that the department of law is founded on
   generation, that of politics on friendship and consent, Plato, with the
   aid he received, affirms; and so, coupled with the laws the philosopher
   in the Epinomis, who knew the course of all generation, which takes
   place by the instrumentality of the planets; and the other philosopher,
   Timæus, who was an astronomer and student of the motions of the stars,
   and of their sympathy and association with one another, he consequently
   joined to the "polity" (or "republic"). Then, in my opinion, the end
   both of the statesman, and of him who lives according to the law, is
   contemplation. It is necessary, therefore, that public affairs should
   be rightly managed. But to philosophize is best. For he who is wise
   will live concentrating all his energies on knowledge, directing his
   life by good deeds, despising the opposite, and following the pursuits
   which contribute to truth. And the law is not what is decided by law
   (for what is seen is not vision), nor every opinion (not certainly what
   is evil). But law is the opinion which is good, and what is good is
   that which is true, and what is true is that which finds "true being,"
   and attains to it. "He who is," [2109] says Moses, "sent me." In
   accordance with which, namely, good opinion, some have called law,
   right reason, which enjoins what is to be done and forbids what is not
   to be done.

      Chapter XXVI.--Moses Rightly Called a Divine Legislator, And, Though
      Inferior to Christ, Far Superior to the Great Legislators of the Greeks,
      Minos and Lycurgus.

   Whence the law was rightly said to have been given by Moses, being a
   rule of right and wrong; and we may call it with accuracy the divine
   ordinance (thesmos [2110] ), inasmuch as it was given by God through
   Moses. It accordingly conducts to the divine. Paul says: "The law was
   instituted because of transgressions, till the seed should come, to
   whom the promise was made." Then, as if in explanation of his meaning,
   he adds: "But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up,"
   manifestly through fear, in consequence of sins, "unto the faith which
   should afterwards be revealed; so that the law was a schoolmaster to
   bring us to Christ, that we should be justified by faith." [2111] The
   true legislator is he who assigns to each department of the soul what
   is suitable to it and to its operations. Now Moses, to speak
   comprehensively, was a living law, governed by the benign Word.
   Accordingly, he furnished a good polity, which is the right discipline
   of men in social life. He also handled the administration of justice,
   which is that branch of knowledge which deals with the correction of
   transgressors in the interests of justice. Co-ordinate with it is the
   faculty of dealing with punishments, which is a knowledge of the due
   measure to be observed in punishments. And punishment, in virtue of its
   being so, is the correction of the soul. In a word, the whole system of
   Moses is suited for the training of such as are capable of becoming
   good and noble men, and for hunting out men like them; and this is the
   art of command. And that wisdom, which is capable of treating rightly
   those who have been caught by the Word, is legislative wisdom. For it
   is the property of this wisdom, being most kingly, to possess and use,

   It is the wise man, therefore, alone whom the philosophers proclaim
   king, legislator, general, just, holy, God-beloved. And if we discover
   these qualities in Moses, as shown from the Scriptures themselves, we
   may, with the most assured persuasion, pronounce Moses to be truly
   wise. As then we say that it belongs to the shepherd's art to care for
   the sheep; for so "the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep;"
   [2112] so also we shall say that legislation, inasmuch as it presides
   over and cares for the flock of men, establishes the virtue of men, by
   fanning into flame, as far as it can, what good there is in humanity.

   And if the flock figuratively spoken of as belonging to the Lord is
   nothing but a flock of men, then He Himself is the good Shepherd and
   Lawgiver of the one flock, "of the sheep who hear Him," the one who
   cares for them, "seeking," and finding by the law and the word, "that
   which was lost;" since, in truth, the law is spiritual and leads to
   felicity. For that which has arisen through the Holy Spirit is
   spiritual. And he is truly a legislator, who not only announces what is
   good and noble, but understands it. The law of this man who possesses
   knowledge is the saving precept; or rather, the law is the precept of
   knowledge. For the Word is "the power and the wisdom of God." [2113]
   Again, the expounder of the laws is the same one by whom the law was
   given; the first expounder of the divine commands, who unveiled the
   bosom of the Father, the only-begotten Son.

   Then those who obey the law, since they have some knowledge of Him,
   cannot disbelieve or be ignorant of the truth. But those who
   disbelieve, and have shown a repugnance to engage in the works of the
   law, whoever else may, certainly confess their ignorance of the truth.

   What, then, is the unbelief of the Greeks? Is it not their
   unwillingness to believe the truth which declares that the law was
   divinely given by Moses, whilst they honour Moses in their own writers?
   They relate that Minos received the laws from Zeus in nine years, by
   frequenting the cave of Zeus; and Plato, and Aristotle, and Ephorus
   write that Lycurgus was trained in legislation by going constantly to
   Apollo at Delphi. Chamæleo of Heraclea, in his book On Drunkenness, and
   Aristotle in The Polity of Locrians, mention that Zaleucus the Locrian
   received the laws from Athene.

   But those who exalt the credit of Greek legislation as far as in them
   lies, by referring it to a divine source, after the model of Mosaic
   prophecy, are senseless in not owning the truth, and the archetype of
   what is related among them.

      Chapter XXVII.--The Law, Even in Correcting and Punishing, Aims at the
      Good of Men.

   Let no, one then, run down law, as if, on account of the penalty, it
   were not beautiful and good. For shall he who drives away bodily
   disease appear a benefactor; and shall not he who attempts to deliver
   the soul from iniquity, as much more appear a friend, as the soul is a
   more precious thing than the body? Besides, for the sake of bodily
   health we submit to incisions, and cauterizations, and medicinal
   draughts; and he who administers them is called saviour and healer,
   [2114] even though amputating parts, not from grudge or ill-will
   towards the patient, but as the principles of the art prescribe, so
   that the sound parts may not perish along with them, and no one accuses
   the physician's art of wickedness; and shall we not similarly submit,
   for the soul's sake, to either banishment, or punishment, or bonds,
   provided only from unrighteousness we shall attain to righteousness?

   For the law, in its solicitude for those who obey, trains up to piety,
   and prescribes what is to be done, and restrains each one from sins,
   imposing penalties even on lesser sins.

   But when it sees any one in such a condition as to appear incurable,
   posting to the last stage of wickedness, then in its solicitude for the
   rest, that they may not be destroyed by it (just as if amputating a
   part from the whole body), it condemns such an one to death, as the
   course most conducive to health. "Being judged by the Lord," says the
   apostle, "we are chastened, that we may not be condemned with the
   world." [2115] For the prophet had said before, "Chastening, the Lord
   hath chastised me, but hath not given me over unto death." [2116] "For
   in order to teach thee His righteousness," it is said, "He chastised
   thee and tried thee, and made thee to hunger and thirst in the desert
   land; that all His statutes and His judgments may be known in thy
   heart, as I command thee this day; and that thou mayest know in thine
   heart, that just as if a man were chastising his son, so the Lord our
   God shall chastise thee." [2117]

   And to prove that example corrects, he says directly to the purpose: "A
   clever man, when he seeth the wicked punished, will himself be severely
   chastised, for the fear of the Lord is the source of wisdom." [2118]

   But it is the highest and most perfect good, when one is able to lead
   back any one from the practice of evil to virtue and well-doing, which
   is the very function of the law. So that, when one fails into any
   incurable evil,--when taken possession of, for example, by wrong or
   covetousness,--it will be for his good if he is put to death. For the
   law is beneficent, being able to make some righteous from unrighteous,
   if they will only give ear to it, and by releasing others from present
   evils; for those who have chosen to live temperately and justly, it
   conducts to immortality. To know the law is characteristic of a good
   disposition. And again: "Wicked men do not understand the law; but they
   who seek the Lord shall have understanding in all that is good." [2119]

   It is essential, certainly, that the providence which manages all, be
   both supreme and good. For it is the power of both that dispenses
   salvation--the one correcting by punishment, as supreme, the other
   showing kindness in the exercise of beneficence, as a benefactor. It is
   in your power not to be a son of disobedience, but to pass from
   darkness to life, and lending your ear to wisdom, to be the legal slave
   of God, in the first instance, and then to become a faithful servant,
   fearing the Lord God. And if one ascend higher, he is enrolled among
   the sons.

   But when "charity covers the multitude of sins," [2120] by the
   consummation of the blessed hope, then may we welcome him as one who
   has been enriched in love, and received into the elect adoption, which
   is called the beloved of God, while he chants the prayer, saying, "Let
   the Lord be my God."

   The beneficent action of the law, the apostle showed in the passage
   relating to the Jews, writing thus: "Behold, thou art called a Jew and
   restest in the law, and makest thy boast in God, and knowest the will
   of God, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being
   instructed out of the law, and art confident that thou thyself art a
   guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness, an instructor
   of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who hast the form of knowledge and
   of truth in the law." [2121] For it is admitted that such is the power
   of the law, although those whose conduct is not according to the law,
   make a false pretence, as if they lived in the law. "Blessed is the man
   that hath found wisdom, and the mortal who has seen understanding; for
   out of its mouth," manifestly Wisdom's, "proceeds righteousness, and it
   bears law and mercy on its tongue." [2122] For both the law and the
   Gospel are the energy of one Lord, who is "the power and wisdom of
   God;" and the terror which the law begets is merciful and in order to
   salvation. "Let not alms, and faith, and truth fail thee, but hang them
   around thy neck." [2123] In the same way as Paul, prophecy upbraids the
   people with not understanding the law. "Destruction and misery are in
   their ways, and the way of peace have they not known." [2124] "There is
   no fear of God before their eyes." [2125] "Professing themselves wise,
   they became fools." [2126] "And we know that the law is good, if a man
   use it lawfully." [2127] "Desiring to be teachers of the law, they
   understand," says the apostle, "neither what they say, nor whereof they
   affirm." [2128] "Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a
   pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned." [2129]

      Chapter XXVIII.--The Fourfold Division of the Mosaic Law.

   The Mosaic philosophy is accordingly divided into four parts,--into the
   historic, and that which is specially called the legislative, which two
   properly belong to an ethical treatise; and the third, that which
   relates to sacrifice, which belongs to physical science; and the
   fourth, above all, the department of theology, "vision," [2130] which
   Plato predicates of the truly great mysteries. And this species
   Aristotle calls metaphysics. Dialectics, according to Plato, is, as he
   says in The Statesman, a science devoted to the discovery of the
   explanation of things. And it is to be acquired by the wise man, not
   for the sake of saying or doing aught of what we find among men (as the
   dialecticians, who occupy themselves in sophistry, do), but to be able
   to say and do, as far as possible, what is pleasing to God. But the
   true dialectic, being philosophy mixed with truth, by examining things,
   and testing forces and powers, gradually ascends in relation to the
   most excellent essence of all, and essays to go beyond to the God of
   the universe, professing not the knowledge of mortal affairs, but the
   science of things divine and heavenly; in accordance with which follows
   a suitable course of practice with respect to words and deeds, even in
   human affairs. Rightly, therefore, the Scripture, in its desire to make
   us such dialecticians, exhorts us: "Be ye skilful money-changers"
   [2131] rejecting some things, but retaining what is good. For this true
   dialectic is the science which analyses the objects of thought, and
   shows abstractly and by itself the individual substratum of existences,
   or the power of dividing things into genera, which descends to their
   most special properties, and presents each individual object to be
   contemplated simply such as it is.

   Wherefore it alone conducts to the true wisdom, which is the divine
   power which deals with the knowledge of entities as entities, which
   grasps what is perfect, and is freed from all passion; not without the
   Saviour, who withdraws, by the divine word, the gloom of ignorance
   arising from evil training, which had overspread the eye of the soul,
   and bestows the best of gifts,--


   "That we might well know or God or man." [2132]

   It is He who truly shows how we are to know ourselves. It is He who
   reveals the Father of the universe to whom He wills, and as far as
   human nature can comprehend. "For no man knoweth the Son but the
   Father, nor the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son shall reveal
   Him." [2133] Rightly, then, the apostle says that it was by revelation
   that he knew the mystery: "As I wrote afore in few words, according as
   ye are able to understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ."
   [2134] "According as ye are able," he said, since he knew that some had
   received milk only, and had not yet received meat, nor even milk
   simply. The sense of the law is to be taken in three ways, [2135]
   --either as exhibiting a symbol, or laying down a precept for right
   conduct, or as uttering a prophecy. But I well know that it belongs to
   men [of full age] to distinguish and declare these things. For the
   whole Scripture is not in its meaning a single Myconos, as the
   proverbial expression has it; but those who hunt after the connection
   of the divine teaching, must approach it with the utmost perfection of
   the logical faculty.

      Chapter XXIX.--The Greeks But Children Compared with the Hebrews.

   Whence most beautifully the Egyptian priest in Plato said, "O Solon,
   Solon, you Greeks are always children, not having in your souls a
   single ancient opinion received through tradition from antiquity. And
   not one of the Greeks is an old man;" [2136] meaning by old, I suppose,
   those who know what belongs to the more remote antiquity, that is, our
   literature; and by young, those who treat of what is more recent and
   made the subject of study by the Greeks,--things of yesterday and of
   recent date as if they were old and ancient. Wherefore he added, "and
   no study hoary with time;" for we, in a kind of barbarous way, deal in
   homely and rugged metaphor. Those, therefore, whose minds are rightly
   constituted approach the interpretation utterly destitute of artifice.
   And of the Greeks, he says that their opinions "differ but little from
   myths." For neither puerile fables nor stories current among children
   are fit for listening to. And he called the myths themselves
   "children," as if the progeny of those, wise in their own conceits
   among the Greeks, who had but little insight; meaning by the "hoary
   studies" the truth which was possessed by the barbarians, dating from
   the highest antiquity. To which expression he opposed the phrase "child
   fable," censuring the mythical character of the attempts of the
   moderns, as, like children, having nothing of age in them, and
   affirming both in common--their fables and their speeches--to be
   puerile.

   Divinely, therefore, the power which spoke to Hermas by revelation
   said, "The visions and revelations are for those who are of double
   mind, who doubt in their hearts if these things are or are not." [2137]

   Similarly, also, demonstrations from the resources of erudition,
   strengthen, confirm, and establish demonstrative reasonings, in so far
   as men's minds are in a wavering state like young people's. "The good
   commandment," then, according to the Scripture, "is a lamp, and the law
   is a light to the path; for instruction corrects the ways of life."
   [2138] "Law is monarch of all, both of mortals and of immortals," says
   Pindar. I understand, however, by these words, Him who enacted law. And
   I regard, as spoken of the God of all, the following utterance of
   Hesiod, though spoken by the poet at random and not with
   comprehension:--


   "For the Saturnian framed for men this law:

   Fishes, and beasts, and winged birds may eat

   Each other, since no rule of right is theirs;

   But Right (by far the best) to men he gave."

   Whether, then, it be the law which is connate and natural, or that
   given afterwards, which is meant, it is certainly of God; and both the
   law of nature and that of instruction are one. Thus also Plato, in The
   Statesman, says that the lawgiver is one; and in The Laws, that he who
   shall understand music is one; teaching by these words that the Word is
   one, and God is one. And Moses manifestly calls the Lord a covenant:
   "Behold I am my Covenant with thee," [2139] having previously told him
   not to seek the covenant in writing. [2140] For it is a covenant which
   God, the Author of all, makes. For God is called Theos, from thesis
   (placing), and order or arrangement. And in the Preaching [2141] of
   Peter you will find the Lord called Law and Word. But at this point,
   let our first Miscellany [2142] of gnostic notes, according to the true
   philosophy, come to a close.

  Elucidations.

      I.

   (Purpose of the Stromata [2143] )

   The Alexandrian Gnostics were the pestilent outgrowth of
   pseudo-Platonism; and nobody could comprehend their root-errors, and
   their branching thorns and thistles, better than Clement. His
   superiority in philosophy and classical culture was exhibited,
   therefore, in his writings, as a necessary preliminary. Like a good
   nautical combatant, his effort was to "get to windward," and so bear
   down upon the enemy (to use an anachronism) with heavy-shotted
   broadsides. And we must not blame Clement for his plan of "taking the
   wind out of their sails," by showing that an eclectic philosophy might
   be made to harmonize with the Gospel. His plan was that of melting the
   gold out of divers ores, and throwing the dross away. Pure gold, he
   argues, is gold wherever it may be found, and even in the purse of
   "thieves and robbers." So, then, he "takes from them the armour in
   which they trusted, and divides the spoils." He will not concede to
   them the name of "Gnostics," but wrests it from them, just as we
   reclaim the name of "Catholics" from the Tridentine innovators, who
   have imposed a modern creed (and are constantly adding to it) upon the
   Latin churches. Here, then, let me quote the Account of Bishop Kaye. He
   says, "The object of Clement, in composing the Stromata, was to
   describe the true Gnostic,' or perfect Christian, in order to furnish
   the believer with a model for his imitation, and to prevent him from
   being led astray by the representations of the Valentinians and other
   gnostic sects." ... "Before we proceed to consider his description of
   the Gnostic, however, it will be necessary briefly to review his
   opinions respecting the nature and condition of man."

   Here follows a luminous analysis (occupying pp. 229-238 of Kaye's
   work), after which he says,--

   "The foregoing brief notice of Clement's opinions respecting man, his
   soul, and his fallen state, appeared necessary as an introduction to
   the description of the true Gnostic. By gnosis, Clement understood the
   perfect knowledge of all that relates to God, His nature, and
   dispensations. He speaks of a twofold knowledge,--one, common to all
   men, and born of sense; the other, the genuine gnosis, bred from the
   intellect, the mind, and its reason. This latter is not born with men,
   but must be gained and by practice formed into a habit. The initiated
   find its perfection in a loving mysticism, which this never-failing
   love makes lasting."

   So, further, this learned analyst, not blindly, but always with
   scientific conscience and judicial impartiality, expounds his author;
   and, without some such guide, I despair of securing the real interest
   of the youthful student. Butler's Analogy and Aristotle's Ethics are
   always analyzed for learners, by editors of their works; and hence I
   have ventured to direct attention to this "guide, philosopher, and
   friend" of my own inquiries. [2144]

      II.

   (Pantænus and His School. [2145] )

   The catechetical school at Alexandria was already ancient; for Eusebius
   describes it as ex archaiou ethousand St. Jerome dates its origin from
   the first planting of Christianity. Many things conspired to make this
   city the very head of Catholic Christendom, at this time; for the whole
   East centred here, and the East was Christendom while the West was yet
   a missionary field almost entirely. Demetrius, then bishop, at the
   times with which we are now concerned, sent Pantænus to convert the
   Hindoos, and, whatever his success or failure there, he brought back
   reports that Christians were there before him, the offspring of St.
   Bartholomew's preaching; and, in proof thereof, he brought with him a
   copy of St. Matthew's Gospel in the Hebrew tongue [2146] which became
   one of the treasures of the church on the Nile.

   But it deserves note, that, because of the learning concentrated in
   this place, the bishops of Alexandria were, from the beginning, the
   great authorities as to the Easter cycle and the annual computation of
   Easter, which new created the science of astronomy as one result. The
   Council of Nice, in settling the laws for the observance of the Feast
   of the Resurrection, extended the function of the Alexandrian See in
   this respect; for it was charged with the duty of giving notice of the
   day when Easter should fall every year, to all the churches. And easily
   might an ambitious primate of Egypt have imagined himself superior to
   all other bishops at that time; for, as Bingham observes, [2147] he was
   the greatest in the world, "for the absoluteness of his power, and the
   extent of his jurisdiction." And this greatness of Alexandria was
   ancient, we must remember, at the Nicene epoch; for their celebrated
   canon (VI.) reads, "Let ancient customs prevail; so that in Egypt,
   Lybia, and Pentapolis, the Bishop of Alexandria shall have power over
   all these." Similar powers and privileges, over their own regions, were
   recognised in Rome and Antioch.

      III.

   (Tradition. [2148] )

   The apostles distinguish between vain traditions of the Jews, and their
   own Christian paradoseisthe tradita apostolica (2 Tim. i. 13, 14; 2
   Tim. ii. 2; 1 Cor. xi. 2; 2 Thess. iii. 6; 1 Cor. v. 8; 1 Cor. xvi. 2).
   Among these were (1) the authentication of their own Scriptures; (2)
   certain "forms of sound words," afterwards digested into liturgies; (3)
   the rules for celebrating the Lord's Supper, and of administering
   baptism; (4) the Christian Passover and the weekly Lord's Day; (5) the
   Jewish Sabbath and ordinances, how far to be respected while the temple
   yet stood; (6) the kiss of charity, and other observances of public
   worship; (7) the agapæ, the rules about widows, etc.

   In some degree these were the secret of the Church, with which
   "strangers intermeddled not" lawfully. The Lord's Supper was celebrated
   after the catechumens and mere hearers had withdrawn, and nobody was
   suffered to be present without receiving the sacrament. But, after the
   conversion of the empire, the canons and constitutions universally
   dispersed made public all these tradita; and the liturgies also were
   everywhere made known. It is idle, therefore, to shelter under theories
   of the Disciplina Arcani, those Middle-Age inventions, of which
   antiquity shows no trace but in many ways contradicts emphatically;
   e.g., the Eucharist, celebrated after the withdrawal of the
   non-communicants, and received, in both kinds, by all present, cannot
   be pleaded as the "secret" which justifies a ceremony in an unknown
   tongue and otherwise utterly different; in which the priest alone
   partakes, in which the cup is denied to the laity and which is
   exhibited with great pomp before all comers with no general
   participation.

      IV.

   (Esoteric Doctrine. [2149] )

   Early Christians, according to Clement, taught to all alike, (1) all
   things necessary to salvation, (2) all the whole Scriptures, and (3)
   all the apostolic traditions. This is evident from passages noted here
   and hereafter. But, in the presence of the heathen, they remembered our
   Lord's words, and were careful not "to cast pearls before swine." Like
   St. Paul before Felix, they "reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and
   judgment to come," when dealing with men who knew not God, preaching
   Christ to them in a practical way. In their instructions to the
   churches, they were able to say with the same apostle, "I am pure from
   the blood of all men, for I have not shunned to declare unto you all
   the counsel of God." Yet, even in the Church, they fed babes with milk,
   and the more intelligent with the meat of God's word. What that meat
   was, we discover in the Stromata, when our author defines the true
   Gnostic, who follows whithersoever God leads him in the divinely
   inspired Scriptures. He recognises many who merely taste the Scriptures
   as believers; but the true Gnostic is a gnomon of truth, an index to
   others of the whole knowledge of Christ.

   What we teach children in the Sunday school, and what we teach young
   men in the theological seminary, must illustrate the two ideas; the
   same truths to babes in element, but to men in all their bearings and
   relations.

   The defenders of the modern creed of Pius the Fourth (a.d. 1564),
   finding no authority in Holy Scripture for most of its peculiarities,
   which are all imposed as requisite to salvation as if it were the
   Apostles' Creed itself, endeavour to support them, by asserting that
   they belonged to the secret teaching of the early Church, of which they
   claim Clement as a witness. But the fallacy is obvious. Either they
   were thus secreted, or they were not. If not, as is most evident
   (because they contradict what was openly professed), then no ground for
   the pretence. But suppose they were, what follows? Such secrets were no
   part of the faith, and could not become so at a later period. If they
   were kept secret by the new theologians, and taught to "Gnostics" only,
   they would still be without primitive example, but might be less
   objectionable. But, no! they are imposed upon all, as if part of the
   ancient creeds; imposed, as if articles of the Catholic faith, on the
   most illiterate peasant, whose mere doubt as to any of them excludes
   him from the Church here, and from salvation hereafter. Such, then, is
   a fatal departure from Catholic orthodoxy and the traditions of the
   ancients. The whole system is a novelty, and the product of the most
   barren and corrupt period of Occidental history.

   The Church, as Clement shows, never made any secret of any article of
   the Christian faith; and, as soon as she was free from persecution, the
   whole testimony of the Ante-Nicene Fathers was summed up in the
   Nicæno-Constantinopolitan Confession. This only is the Catholic faith,
   and the council forbade any additions thereto, in the way of a symbol.
   See Professor Shedd's Christian Doctrine, vol. ii. p. 438. Ed. 1864,
   New York.

      V.

   (p. 302, [38]note 9, Elucidation III., continued.)

   This is a valuable passage for the illustration of our author's views
   of the nature of tradition, (kata ton semnon tes paradoseos kanona as a
   canon "from the creation of the world;" a tradition preluding the
   tradition of true knowledge; a divine mystery preparing for the
   knowledge of mysteries,--clearing the ground from thorns and weeds,
   beforehand, so that the seed of the Word may not be choked. Now, in
   this tradition, he includes a true idea of Gentilism as well as of the
   Hebrew Church and its covenant relations; in short, whatever a
   Christian scholar is obliged to learn from "Antiquities" and
   "Introductions" and "Bible Dictionaries," authenticated by universal
   and orthodox approbation. These are the providential provisions of the
   Divine OEconomy, for the communication of truth. Dr. Watts has a sermon
   on the Inward Witness to Christianity, which I find quoted by Vicesimus
   Knox (Works, vol. vii. p. 73, et seqq.) in a choice passage that
   forcibly expands and expounds some of Clement's suggestions, though
   without referring to our author.

      VI.

   (Justification, p. 305 [39]note 7.)

   Without reference to my own views on this great subject, and desiring
   merely to illustrate our author, it shall suffice to remark, here, that
   to suppose that Clement uses the word technically, as we now use the
   language of the schools and of post-Reformation theologians, would
   hopelessly confuse the argument of our author. It is clear that he has
   no idea of any justification apart from the merits of Christ: but he
   uses the term loosely to express his idea, that as the Law led the
   Hebrews to the great Healer, who rose from the dead for our
   justification, in that sense, and in no other, the truth that was to be
   found in Greek Philosophy, although a minimum, did the same for heathen
   who loved truth, and followed it so far as they knew. Whether his views
   even in this were correct, it would not become me, here, to express any
   opinion. (See below, Elucidation XIV.)

      VII.

   (Philosophy, p. 305, [40]note 8.)

   It is so important to grasp just what our author understands by this
   "philosophy," that I had designed to introduce, here, a long passage
   from Bishop Kaye's lucid exposition. Finding, however, that these
   elucidations are already, perhaps, over multiplied, I content myself
   with a reference to his Account, etc. (pp. 118-121).

      VIII.

   (Overflow of the Spirit, p. 306, [41]note 1.)

   Here, again, I wished to introduce textual citations from several
   eminent authors: I content myself with a very short one from Kaye, to
   illustrate the intricacy, not to say the contradictory character, of
   some of Clement's positions as to the extent of grace bestowed on the
   heathen. "Clement says that an act, to be right, must be done through
   the love of God. He says that every action of the heathen is sinful,
   since it is not sufficient that an action is right: its object or aim
   must also be right" (Account, etc., p. 426). For a most interesting,
   but I venture to think overdrawn, statement of St. Paul's position as
   to heathen "wisdom," etc., see Farrar's Life of St. Paul (p. 20, et
   seqq., ed. New York). Without relying on this popular author, I cannot
   but refer the reader to his Hulsean Lecture (1870, p. 135, et seqq.).

      IX.

   (Faith without Learning, p. 307, [42]note 5.)

   The compassion of Christ for poverty, misery, for childhood, and for
   ignorance, is everywhere illustrated in Holy Scripture; and faith, even
   "as a grain of mustard seed," is magnified, accordingly, in the
   infinite love of his teaching. Again I am willing to refer to Farrar
   (though I read him always with something between the lines, before I
   can adopt his sweeping generalizations) for a fine passage, I should
   quote entire, did space permit (The Witness of History to Christ, p.
   172, ed. London, 1872). See also the noble sermon of Jeremy Taylor on
   John vii. 17 (Works, vol. ii. p. 53, ed. Bohn, 1844).

      X.

   (The Open Secret, p. 313, [43]note 3.)

   The esoteric system of Clement is here expounded in few words: there is
   nothing in it which may not be proclaimed from the house-tops, for all
   who have ears to hear. It is the mere swine (with seed-pickers and
   jack-daws, the spermologoi of the Athenians) who must be denied the
   pearls of gnostic truth. And this, on the same merciful principle on
   which the Master was silent before Pilate, and turned away from cities
   where they were not prepared to receive his message.

      XI.

   (Bodily Purity, p. 317, [44]note 1.)

   From a familiar quotation, I have often argued that the fine instinct
   of a woman, even among heathen, enforces a true idea: "If from her
   husband's bed, as soon as she has bathed: if from adulterous commerce,
   not at all." This is afterwards noted by our author; [2150] but it is
   extraordinary to find the mind of the great missionary to our Saxon
   forefathers, troubled about such questions, even in the seventh
   century. I have less admiration for the elaborate answers of the great
   Patriarch of Rome (Gregory), to the scrupulous inquiries of Augustine,
   than for the instinctive and aphoristic wisdom of poor Theano, in all
   the darkness of her heathenism. (See Ven. Bede, Eccles. Hist., book i.
   cap. 27, p. 131. Works, ed. London, 1843.)

      XII.

   (Clement's View of Philosophy, p. 318, [45]note 4.)

   I note the concluding words of this chapter (xvi.), as epitomizing the
   whole of what Clement means to say on this great subject; and, for
   more, see the Elucidation infra, on Justification.

      XIII.

   (The Ecstacy of Sibyl, etc., p. 319, [46]note 3.)

   No need to quote Virgil's description (Æneid, vi. 46, with Heyne's
   references in Excursus V.); but I would compare with his picture of
   Sibylline inspiration, that of Balaam (Numbers 24:3, 4, 15, 16), and
   leave with the student an inquiry, how far we may credit to a divine
   motion, the oracles of the heathen, i.e., some of them. I wish to refer
   the student, also, as to a valuable bit of introductory learning, to
   the essay of Isaac Casaubon (Exercitationes ad Baronii Prolegom., pp.
   65-85, ed. Genevæ, 1663).

      XIV.

   (Justification, p. 323, [47]note 2.)

   Casaubon, in the work just quoted above (Exercitat., i.) examines this
   passage of our author, and others, comparing them with passages from
   St. Chrysostom and St. Augustine, and with Justin Martyr (see vol. i.
   p. 178, this series, cap. 46). Bishop Kaye (p. 428) justly remarks:
   "The apparent incorrectness of Clement's language arises from not
   making that clear distinction which the controversies at the time of
   the Reformation introduced." The word "incorrectness," though for
   myself I do not object to it, might be said "to beg the question;" and
   hence I should prefer to leave it open to the divers views of readers,
   by speaking, rather, of his lack of precision in the use of a term not
   then defined with theological delicacy of statement.

      XV.

   (Chronology, p. 334, [48]note 5.)

   Here an invaluable work for comparison and reference must be consulted
   by the student; viz., the Chronicon of Julius Africanus, in Routh's
   Reliquiæ (tom ii. p. 220, et seqq.), with learned annotations, in which
   (e.g., p. 491) Clement's work is cited. Africanus took up chronological
   science in the imperfect state where it was left by Clement, with whom
   he was partially contemporary; for he was Bishop of Emmaus in Palestine
   (called also Nicopolis), and composed his fine books of chronological
   history, under Marcus Aurelius. [2151] On the Alexandrian era consult a
   paragraph in Encyc. Britannica (vol. v. p. 714). It was adopted for
   Christian computation, after Africanus. See Eusebius (book vi. cap.
   31), and compare (this volume, p. 85) what is said of Theophilus of
   Antioch, by Abp. Usher. [2152]

      Chapter I.--Introductory. [2153]

   As Scripture has called the Greeks pilferers of the Barbarian [2154]
   philosophy, it will next have to be considered how this may be briefly
   demonstrated. For we shall not only show that they have imitated and
   copied the marvels recorded in our books; but we shall prove, besides,
   that they have plagiarized and falsified (our writings being, as we
   have shown, older) the chief dogmas they hold, both on faith and
   knowledge and science, and hope and love, and also on repentance and
   temperance and the fear of God,--a whole swarm, verily, of the virtues
   of truth.

   Whatever the explication necessary on the point in hand shall demand,
   shall be embraced, and especially what is occult in the barbarian
   philosophy, the department of symbol and enigma; which those who have
   subjected the teaching of the ancients to systematic philosophic study
   have affected, as being in the highest degree serviceable, nay,
   absolutely necessary to the knowledge of truth. In addition, it will in
   my opinion form an appropriate sequel to defend those tenets, on
   account of which the Greeks assail us, making use of a few Scriptures,
   if perchance the Jew also may listen [2155] and be able quietly to turn
   from what he has believed to Him on whom he has not believed. The
   ingenuous among the philosophers will then with propriety be taken up
   in a friendly exposure both of their life and of the discovery of new
   dogmas, not in the way of our avenging ourselves on our detractors (for
   that is far from being the case with those who have learned to bless
   those who curse, even though they needlessly discharge on us words of
   blasphemy), but with a view to their conversion; if by any means these
   adepts in wisdom may feel ashamed, being brought to their senses by
   barbarian demonstration; so as to be able, although late, to see
   clearly of what sort are the intellectual acquisitions for which they
   make pilgrimages over the seas. Those they have stolen are to be
   pointed out, that we may thereby pull down their conceit; and of those
   on the discovery of which through investigation they plume themselves,
   the refutation will be furnished. By consequence, also we must treat of
   what is called the curriculum of study--how far it is serviceable;
   [2156] and of astrology, and mathematics, and magic, and sorcery. For
   all the Greeks boast of these as the highest sciences. "He who reproves
   boldly is a peacemaker." [2157] We have often said already that we have
   neither practiced nor do we study the expressing ourselves in pure
   Greek; for this suits those who seduce the multitude from the truth.
   But true philosophic demonstration will contribute to the profit not of
   the listeners' tongues, but of their minds. And, in my opinion, he who
   is solicitous about truth ought not to frame his language with
   artfulness and care, but only to try to express his meaning as he best
   can. For those who are particular about words, and devote their time to
   them, miss the things. [2158] It is a feat fit for the gardener to
   pluck without injury the rose that is growing among the thorns; and for
   the craftsman to find out the pearl buried in the oyster's flesh. And
   they say that fowls have flesh of the most agreeable quality, when,
   through not being supplied with abundance of food, they pick their
   sustenance with difficulty, scraping with their feet. If any one, then,
   speculating on what is similar, wants to arrive [2159] at the truth
   [that is] in the numerous Greek plausibilities, like the real face
   beneath masks, he will hunt it out with much pains. For the power that
   appeared in the vision to Hermas said, "Whatever may be revealed to
   you, shall be revealed." [2160]

      Chapter II.--The Knowledge of God Can Be Attained Only Through Faith.

   "Be not elated on account of thy wisdom," say the Proverbs. "In all thy
   ways acknowledge her, that she may direct thy ways, and that thy foot
   may not stumble." By these remarks he means to show that our deeds
   ought to be conformable to reason, and to manifest further that we
   ought to select and possess what is useful out of all culture. Now the
   ways of wisdom are various that lead right to the way of truth. Faith
   is the way. "Thy foot shall not stumble" is said with reference to some
   who seem to oppose the one divine administration of Providence. Whence
   it is added, "Be not wise in thine own eyes," according to the impious
   ideas which revolt against the administration of God. "But fear God,"
   who alone is powerful. Whence it follows as a consequence that we are
   not to oppose God. The sequel especially teaches clearly, that "the
   fear of God is departure from evil;" for it is said, "and depart from
   all evil." Such is the discipline of wisdom ("for whom the Lord loveth
   He chastens" [2161] ), causing pain in order to produce understanding,
   and restoring to peace and immortality. Accordingly, the Barbarian
   philosophy, which we follow, is in reality perfect and true. And so it
   is said in the book of Wisdom: "For He hath given me the unerring
   knowledge of things that exist, to know the constitution of the word,"
   and so forth, down to "and the virtues of roots." Among all these he
   comprehends natural science, which treats of all the phenomena in the
   world of sense. And in continuation, he alludes also to intellectual
   objects in what he subjoins: "And what is hidden or manifest I know;
   for Wisdom, the artificer of all things, taught me." [2162] You have,
   in brief, the professed aim of our philosophy; and the learning of
   these branches, when pursued with right course of conduct, leads
   through Wisdom, the artificer of all things, to the Ruler of all,--a
   Being difficult to grasp and apprehend, ever receding and withdrawing
   from him who pursues. But He who is far off has--oh ineffable
   marvel!--come very near. "I am a God that draws near," says the Lord.
   He is in essence remote; "for how is it that what is begotten can have
   approached the Unbegotten?" But He is very near in virtue of that power
   which holds all things in its embrace. "Shall one do aught in secret,
   and I see him not?" [2163] For the power of God is always present, in
   contact with us, in the exercise of inspection, of beneficence, of
   instruction. Whence Moses, persuaded that God is not to be known by
   human wisdom, said, "Show me Thy glory;" [2164] and into the thick
   darkness where God's voice was, pressed to enter--that is, into the
   inaccessible and invisible ideas respecting Existence. For God is not
   in darkness or in place, but above both space and time, and qualities
   of objects. Wherefore neither is He at any time in a part, either as
   containing or as contained, either by limitation or by section. "For
   what house will ye build to Me?" saith the Lord. [2165] Nay, He has not
   even built one for Himself, since He cannot be contained. And though
   heaven be called His throne, not even thus is He contained, but He
   rests delighted in the creation.

   It is clear, then, that the truth has been hidden from us; and if that
   has been already shown by one example, we shall establish it a little
   after by several more. How entirely worthy of approbation are they who
   are both willing to learn, and able, according to Solomon, "to know
   wisdom and instruction, and to perceive the words of wisdom, to receive
   knotty words, and to perceive true righteousness," there being another
   [righteousness as well], not according to the truth, taught by the
   Greek laws, and by the rest of the philosophers. "And to direct
   judgments," it is said--not those of the bench, but he means that we
   must preserve sound and free of error the judicial faculty which is
   within us--"That I may give subtlety to the simple, to the young man
   sense and understanding." [2166] "For the wise man," who has been
   persuaded to obey the commandments, "having heard these things, will
   become wiser" by knowledge; and "the intelligent man will acquire rule,
   and will understand a parable and a dark word, the sayings and enigmas
   of the wise." [2167] For it is not spurious words which those inspired
   by God and those who are gained over by them adduce, nor is it snares
   in which the most of the sophists entangle the young, spending their
   time on nought true. But those who possess the Holy Spirit "search the
   deep things of God," [2168] --that is, grasp the secret that is in the
   prophecies. "To impart of holy things to the dogs" is forbidden, so
   long as they remain beasts. For never ought those who are envious and
   perturbed, and still infidel in conduct, shameless in barking at
   investigation, to dip in the divine and clear stream of the living
   water. "Let not the waters of thy fountain overflow, and let thy waters
   spread over thine own streets." [2169] For it is not many who
   understand such things as they fall in with; or know them even after
   learning them, though they think they do, according to the worthy
   Heraclitus. Does not even he seem to thee to censure those who believe
   not? "Now my just one shall live by faith," [2170] the prophet said.
   And another prophet also says, "Except ye believe, neither shall ye
   understand." [2171] For how ever could the soul admit the
   transcendental contemplation of such themes, while unbelief respecting
   what was to be learned struggled within? But faith, which the Greeks
   disparage, deeming it futile and barbarous, is a voluntary
   preconception, [2172] the assent of piety--"the subject of things hoped
   for, the evidence of things not seen," according to the divine apostle.
   "For hereby," pre-eminently, "the elders obtained a good report. But
   without faith it is impossible to please God." [2173] Others have
   defined faith to be a uniting assent to an unseen object, as certainly
   the proof of an unknown thing is an evident assent. If then it be
   choice, being desirous of something, the desire is in this instance
   intellectual. And since choice is the beginning of action, faith is
   discovered to be the beginning of action, being the foundation of
   rational choice in the case of any one who exhibits to himself the
   previous demonstration through faith. Voluntarily to follow what is
   useful, is the first principle of understanding. Unswerving choice,
   then, gives considerable momentum in the direction of knowledge. The
   exercise of faith directly becomes knowledge, reposing on a sure
   foundation. Knowledge, accordingly, is defined by the sons of the
   philosophers as a habit, which cannot be overthrown by reason. Is there
   any other true condition such as this, except piety, of which alone the
   Word is teacher? [2174] I think not. Theophrastus says that sensation
   is the root of faith. For from it the rudimentary principles extend to
   the reason that is in us, and the understanding. He who believeth then
   the divine Scriptures with sure judgment, receives in the voice of God,
   who bestowed the Scripture, a demonstration that cannot be impugned.
   Faith, then, is not established by demonstration. "Blessed therefore
   those who, not having seen, yet have believed." [2175] The Siren's
   songs, exhibiting a power above human, fascinated those that came near,
   conciliating them, almost against their will, to the reception of what
   was said.

      Chapter III.--Faith Not a Product of Nature.

   Now the followers of Basilides regard faith as natural, as they also
   refer it to choice, [representing it] as finding ideas by intellectual
   comprehension without demonstration; while the followers of Valentinus
   assign faith to us, the simple, but will have it that knowledge springs
   up in their own selves (who are saved by nature) through the advantage
   of a germ of superior excellence, saying that it is as far removed from
   faith as [2176] the spiritual is from the animal. Further, the
   followers of Basilides say that faith as well as choice is proper
   according to every interval; and that in consequence of the
   supramundane selection mundane faith accompanies all nature, and that
   the free gift of faith is comformable to the hope of each. Faith, then,
   is no longer the direct result of free choice, if it is a natural
   advantage.

   Nor will he who has not believed, not being the author [of his
   unbelief], meet with a due recompense; and he that has believed is not
   the cause [of his belief]. And the entire peculiarity and difference of
   belief and unbelief will not fall under either praise or censure, if we
   reflect rightly, since there attaches to it the antecedent natural
   necessity proceeding from the Almighty. And if we are pulled like
   inanimate things by the puppet-strings of natural powers, willingness
   [2177] and unwillingness, and impulse, which is the antecedent of both,
   are mere redundancies. And for my part, I am utterly incapable of
   conceiving such an animal as has its appetencies, which are moved by
   external causes, under the dominion of necessity. And what place is
   there any longer for the repentance of him who was once an unbeliever,
   through which comes forgiveness of sins? So that neither is baptism
   rational, nor the blessed seal, [2178] nor the Son, nor the Father. But
   God, as I think, turns out to be the distribution to men of natural
   powers, which has not as the foundation of salvation voluntary faith.

     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter IV.--Faith the Foundation of All Knowledge.

   But we, who have heard by the Scriptures that self-determining choice
   and refusal have been given by the Lord to men, rest in the infallible
   criterion of faith, manifesting a willing spirit, since we have chosen
   life and believe God through His voice. And he who has believed the
   Word knows the matter to be true; for the Word is truth. But he who has
   disbelieved Him that speaks, has disbelieved God.

   "By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God,
   so that what is seen was not made of things which appear," says the
   apostle. "By faith Abel offered to God a fuller sacrifice than Cain, by
   which he received testimony that he was righteous, God giving testimony
   to him respecting his gifts; and by it he, being dead, yet speaketh,"
   and so forth, down to "than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season."
   [2179] Faith having, therefore, justified these before the law, made
   them heirs of the divine promise. Why then should I review and adduce
   any further testimonies of faith from the history in our hands? "For
   the time would fail me were I to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson,
   Jephtha, David, and Samuel, and the prophets," and what follows. [2180]
   Now, inasmuch as there are four things in which the truth
   resides--Sensation, Understanding, Knowledge, Opinion,--intellectual
   apprehension is first in the order of nature; but in our case, and in
   relation to ourselves, Sensation is first, and of Sensation and
   Understanding the essence of Knowledge is formed; and evidence is
   common to Understanding and Sensation. Well, Sensation is the ladder to
   Knowledge; while Faith, advancing over the pathway of the objects of
   sense, leaves Opinion behind, and speeds to things free of deception,
   and reposes in the truth.

   Should one say that Knowledge is founded on demonstration by a process
   of reasoning, let him hear that first principles are incapable of
   demonstration; for they are known neither by art nor sagacity. For the
   latter is conversant about objects that are susceptible of change,
   while the former is practical solely, and not theoretical. [2181] Hence
   it is thought that the first cause of the universe can be apprehended
   by faith alone. For all knowledge is capable of being taught; and what
   is capable of being taught is founded on what is known before. But the
   first cause of the universe was not previously known to the Greeks;
   neither, accordingly, to Thales, who came to the conclusion that water
   was the first cause; nor to the other natural philosophers who
   succeeded him, since it was Anaxagoras who was the first who assigned
   to Mind the supremacy over material things. But not even he preserved
   the dignity suited to the efficient cause, describing as he did certain
   silly vortices, together with the inertia and even foolishness of Mind.
   Wherefore also the Word says, "Call no man master on earth." [2182] For
   knowledge is a state of mind that results from demonstration; but faith
   is a grace which from what is indemonstrable conducts to what is
   universal and simple, what is neither with matter, nor matter, nor
   under matter. But those who believe not, as to be expected, drag all
   down from heaven, and the region of the invisible, to earth,
   "absolutely grasping with their hands rocks and oaks," according to
   Plato. For, clinging to all such things, they asseverate that that
   alone exists which can be touched and handled, defining body and
   essence to be identical: disputing against themselves, they very
   piously defend the existence of certain intellectual and bodiless forms
   descending somewhere from above from the invisible world, vehemently
   maintaining that there is a true essence. "Lo, I make new things,"
   saith the Word, "which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it
   entered into the heart of man." [2183] With a new eye, a new ear, a new
   heart, whatever can be seen and heard is to be apprehended, by the
   faith and understanding of the disciples of the Lord, who speak, hear,
   and act spiritually. For there is genuine coin, and other that is
   spurious; which no less deceives unprofessionals, that it does not the
   money-changers; who know through having learned how to separate and
   distinguish what has a false stamp from what is genuine. So the
   money-changer only says to the unprofessional man that the coin is
   counterfeit. But the reason why, only the banker's apprentice, and he
   that is trained to this department, learns.

   Now Aristotle says that the judgment which follows knowledge is in
   truth faith. Accordingly, faith is something superior to knowledge, and
   is its criterion. Conjecture, which is only a feeble supposition,
   counterfeits faith; as the flatterer counterfeits a friend, and the
   wolf the dog. And as the workman sees that by learning certain things
   he becomes an artificer, and the helmsman by being instructed in the
   art will be able to steer; he does not regard the mere wishing to
   become excellent and good enough, but he must learn it by the exercise
   of obedience. But to obey the Word, whom we call Instructor, is to
   believe Him, going against Him in nothing. For how can we take up a
   position of hostility to God? Knowledge, accordingly, is characterized
   by faith; and faith, by a kind of divine mutual and reciprocal
   correspondence, becomes characterized by knowledge.

   Epicurus, too, who very greatly preferred pleasure to truth, supposes
   faith to be a preconception of the mind; and defines preconception to
   be a grasping at something evident, and at the clear understanding of
   the thing; and asserts that, without preconception, no one can either
   inquire, or doubt, or judge, or even argue. How can one, without a
   preconceived idea of what he is aiming after, learn about that which is
   the subject of his investigation? He, again, who has learned has
   already turned his preconception [2184] into comprehension. And if he
   who learns, learns not without a preconceived idea which takes in what
   is expressed, that man has ears to hear the truth. And happy is the man
   that speaks to the ears of those who hear; as happy certainly also is
   he who is a child of obedience. Now to hear is to understand. If, then,
   faith is nothing else than a preconception of the mind in regard to
   what is the subject of discourse, and obedience is so called, and
   understanding and persuasion; no one shall learn aught without faith,
   since no one [learns aught] without preconception. Consequently there
   is a more ample demonstration of the complete truth of what was spoken
   by the prophet, "Unless ye believe, neither will ye understand."
   Paraphrasing this oracle, Heraclitus of Ephesus says, "If a man hope
   not, he will not find that which is not hoped for, seeing it is
   inscrutable and inaccessible." Plato the philosopher, also, in The
   Laws, says, "that he who would be blessed and happy, must be straight
   from the beginning a partaker of the truth, so as to live true for as
   long a period as possible; for he is a man of faith. But the unbeliever
   is one to whom voluntary falsehood is agreeable; and the man to whom
   involuntary falsehood is agreeable is senseless; [2185] neither of
   which is desirable. For he who is devoid of friendliness, is faithless
   and ignorant." And does he not enigmatically say in Euthydemus, that
   this is "the regal wisdom"? In The Statesman he says expressly, "So
   that the knowledge of the true king is kingly; and he who possesses it,
   whether a prince or private person, shall by all means, in consequence
   of this act, be rightly styled royal." Now those who have believed in
   Christ both are and are called Chrestoi (good), [2186] as those who are
   cared for by the true king are kingly. For as the wise are wise by
   their wisdom, and those observant of law are so by the law; so also
   those who belong to Christ the King are kings, and those that are
   Christ's Christians. Then, in continuation, he adds clearly, "What is
   right will turn out to be lawful, law being in its nature right reason,
   and not found in writings or elsewhere." And the stranger of Elea
   pronounces the kingly and statesmanlike man "a living law." Such is he
   who fulfils the law, "doing the will of the Father," [2187] inscribed
   on a lofty pillar, and set as an example of divine virtue to all who
   possess the power of seeing. The Greeks are acquainted with the staves
   of the Ephori at Lacedæmon, inscribed with the law on wood. But my law,
   as was said above, is both royal and living; and it is right reason.
   "Law, which is king of all--of mortals and immortals," as the Boeotian
   Pindar sings. For Speusippus, [2188] in the first book against
   Cleophon, seems to write like Plato on this wise: "For if royalty be a
   good thing, and the wise man the only king and ruler, the law, which is
   right reason, is good;" [2189] which is the case. The Stoics teach what
   is in conformity with this, assigning kinghood, priesthood, prophecy,
   legislation, riches, true beauty, noble birth, freedom, to the wise man
   alone. But that he is exceedingly difficult to find, is confessed even
   by them.

      Chapter V.--He Proves by Several Examples that the Greeks Drew from the
      Sacred Writers.

   Accordingly all those above-mentioned dogmas appear to have been
   transmitted from Moses the great to the Greeks. That all things belong
   to the wise man, is taught in these words: "And because God hath showed
   me mercy, I have all things." [2190] And that he is beloved of God, God
   intimates when He says, "The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God
   of Jacob." [2191] For the first is found to have been expressly called
   "friend;" [2192] and the second is shown to have received a new name,
   signifying "he that sees God;" [2193] while Isaac, God in a figure
   selected for Himself as a consecrated sacrifice, to be a type to us of
   the economy of salvation.

   Now among the Greeks, Minos the king of nine years' reign, and familiar
   friend of Zeus, is celebrated in song; they having heard how once God
   conversed with Moses, "as one speaking with his friend." [2194] Moses,
   then, was a sage, king, legislator. But our Saviour surpasses all human
   nature. [2195] He is so lovely, as to be alone loved by us, whose
   hearts are set on the true beauty, for "He was the true light." [2196]
   He is shown to be a King, as such hailed by unsophisticated children
   and by the unbelieving and ignorant Jews, and heralded by the prophets.
   So rich is He, that He despised the whole earth, and the gold above and
   beneath it, with all glory, when given to Him by the adversary. What
   need is there to say that He is the only High Priest, who alone
   possesses the knowledge of the worship of God? [2197] He is
   Melchizedek, "King of peace," [2198] the most fit of all to head the
   race of men. A legislator too, inasmuch as He gave the law by the mouth
   of the prophets, enjoining and teaching most distinctly what things are
   to be done, and what not. Who of nobler lineage than He whose only
   Father is God? Come, then, let us produce Plato assenting to those very
   dogmas. The wise man he calls rich in the Phoedrus, when he says, "O
   dear Pan, and whatever other gods are here, grant me to become fair
   within; and whatever external things I have, let them be agreeable to
   what is within. I would reckon the wise man rich." [2199] And the
   Athenian stranger, [2200] finding fault with those who think that those
   who have many possessions are rich, speaks thus: "For the very rich to
   be also good is impossible--those, I mean, whom the multitude count
   rich. Those they call rich, who, among a few men, are owners of the
   possessions worth most money; which any bad man may possess." "The
   whole world of wealth belongs to the believer," [2201] Solomon says,
   "but not a penny to the unbeliever." Much more, then, is the Scripture
   to be believed which says, "It is easier for a camel to go through the
   eye of a needle, than for a rich man" [2202] to lead a philosophic
   life. But, on the other hand, it blesses "the poor;" [2203] as Plato
   understood when he said, "It is not the diminishing of one's resources,
   but the augmenting of insatiableness, that is to be considered poverty;
   for it is not slender means that ever constitutes poverty, but
   insatiableness, from which the good man being free, will also be rich."
   And in Alcibiades he calls vice a servile thing, and virtue the
   attribute of freemen. "Take away from you the heavy yoke, and take up
   the easy one," [2204] says the Scripture; as also the poets call [vice]
   a slavish yoke. And the expression, "Ye have sold yourselves to your
   sins," agrees with what is said above: "Every one, then, who committeth
   sin is a slave; and the slave abideth not in the house for ever. But if
   the Son shall make you free, then shall ye be free, and the truth shall
   make you free." [2205]

   And again, that the wise man is beautiful, the Athenian stranger
   asserts, in the same way as if one were to affirm that certain persons
   were just, even should they happen to be ugly in their persons. And in
   speaking thus with respect to eminent rectitude of character, no one
   who should assert them to be on this account beautiful would be thought
   to speak extravagantly. And "His appearance was inferior to all the
   Sons of men," [2206] prophecy predicted.

   Plato, moreover, has called the wise man a king, in The Statesman. The
   remark is quoted above.

   These points being demonstrated, let us recur again to our discourse on
   faith. Well, with the fullest demonstration, Plato proves, that there
   is need of faith everywhere, celebrating peace at the same time: "For
   no man will ever be trusty and sound in seditions without entire
   virtue. There are numbers of mercenaries full of fight, and willing to
   die in war; but, with a very few exceptions, the most of them are
   desperadoes and villains, insolent and senseless." If these
   observations are right, "every legislator who is even of slight use,
   will, in making his laws, have an eye to the greatest virtue. Such is
   fidelity," [2207] which we need at all times, both in peace and in war,
   and in all the rest of our life, for it appears to embrace the other
   virtues. "But the best thing is neither war nor sedition, for the
   necessity of these is to be deprecated. But peace with one another and
   kindly feeling are what is best." From these remarks the greatest
   prayer evidently is to have peace, according to Plato. And faith is the
   greatest mother of the virtues. Accordingly it is rightly said in
   Solomon, "Wisdom is in the mouth of the faithful." [2208] Since also
   Xenocrates, in his book on "Intelligence," says "that wisdom is the
   knowledge of first causes and of intellectual essence." He considers
   intelligence as twofold, practical and theoretical, which latter is
   human wisdom. Consequently wisdom is intelligence, but all intelligence
   is not wisdom. And it has been shown, that the knowledge of the first
   cause of the universe is of faith, but is not demonstration. For it
   were strange that the followers of the Samian Pythagoras, rejecting
   demonstrations of subjects of question, should regard the bare ipse
   dixit [2209] as ground of belief; and that this expression alone
   sufficed for the confirmation of what they heard, while those devoted
   to the contemplation of the truth, presuming to disbelieve the
   trustworthy Teacher, God the only Saviour, should demand of Him tests
   of His utterances. But He says, "He that hath ears to hear, let him
   hear." And who is he? Let Epicharmus say:--


   "Mind sees, mind hears; all besides is deaf and blind." [2210]

   Rating some as unbelievers, Heraclitus says, "Not knowing how to hear
   or to speak;" aided doubtless by Solomon, who says, "If thou lovest to
   hear, thou shalt comprehend; and if thou incline thine ear, thou shalt
   be wise." [2211]

      Chapter VI.--The Excellence and Utility of Faith.

   "Lord, who hath believed our report?" [2212] Isaiah says. For "faith
   cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God," saith the apostle.
   "How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And
   how shall they believe on Him whom they have not heard? And how shall
   they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach except they be
   sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those that
   publish glad tidings of good things." [2213] You see how he brings
   faith by hearing, and the preaching of the apostles, up to the word of
   the Lord, and to the Son of God. We do not yet understand the word of
   the Lord to be demonstration.

   As, then, playing at ball not only depends on one throwing the ball
   skilfully, but it requires besides one to catch it dexterously, that
   the game may be gone through according to the rules for ball; so also
   is it the case that teaching is reliable when faith on the part of
   those who hear, being, so to speak, a sort of natural art, contributes
   to the process of learning. So also the earth co-operates, through its
   productive power, being fit for the sowing of the seed. For there is no
   good of the very best instruction without the exercise of the receptive
   faculty on the part of the learner, not even of prophecy, when there is
   the absence of docility on the part of those who hear. For dry twigs,
   being ready to receive the power of fire, are kindled with great ease;
   and the far-famed stone [2214] attracts steel through affinity, as the
   amber tear-drop drags to itself twigs, and the lump sets chaff in
   motion. And the substances attracted obey them, influenced by a subtle
   spirit, not as a cause, but as a concurring cause.

   There being then a twofold species of vice--that characterized by craft
   and stealth, and that which leads and drives with violence--the divine
   Word cries, calling all together; knowing perfectly well those that
   will not obey; notwithstanding then since to obey or not is in our own
   power, provided we have not the excuse of ignorance to adduce. He makes
   a just call, and demands of each according to his strength. For some
   are able as well as willing, having reached this point through practice
   and being purified; while others, if they are not yet able, already
   have the will. Now to will is the act of the soul, but to do is not
   without the body. Nor are actions estimated by their issue alone; but
   they are judged also according to the element of free choice in
   each,--if he chose easily, if he repented of his sins, if he reflected
   on his failures and repented (metegno), which is (meta tauta egno)
   "afterwards knew." For repentance is a tardy knowledge, and primitive
   innocence is knowledge. Repentance, then, is an effect of faith. For
   unless a man believe that to which he was addicted to be sin, he will
   not abandon it; and if he do not believe punishment to be impending
   over the transgressor, and salvation to be the portion of him who lives
   according to the commandments, he will not reform.

   Hope, too, is based on faith. Accordingly the followers of Basilides
   define faith to be, the assent of the soul to any of those things, that
   do not affect the senses through not being present. And hope is the
   expectation of the possession of good. Necessarily, then, is
   expectation founded on faith. Now he is faithful who keeps inviolably
   what is entrusted to him; and we are entrusted with the utterances
   respecting God and the divine words, the commands along with the
   execution of the injunctions. This is the faithful servant, who is
   praised by the Lord. And when it is said, "God is faithful," it is
   intimated that He is worthy to be believed when declaring aught. Now
   His Word declares; and "God" Himself is "faithful." [2215] How, then,
   if to believe is to suppose, do the philosophers think that what
   proceeds from themselves is sure? For the voluntary assent to a
   preceding demonstration is not supposition, but it is assent to
   something sure. Who is more powerful than God? Now unbelief is the
   feeble negative supposition of one opposed to Him: as incredulity is a
   condition which admits faith with difficulty. Faith is the voluntary
   supposition and anticipation of pre-comprehension. Expectation is an
   opinion about the future, and expectation about other things is opinion
   about uncertainty. Confidence is a strong judgment about a thing.
   Wherefore we believe Him in whom we have confidence unto divine glory
   and salvation. And we confide in Him, who is God alone, whom we know,
   that those things nobly promised to us, and for this end benevolently
   created and bestowed by Him on us, will not fail.

   Benevolence is the wishing of good things to another for his sake. For
   He needs nothing; and the beneficence and benignity which flow from the
   Lord terminate in us, being divine benevolence, and benevolence
   resulting in beneficence. And if to Abraham on his believing it was
   counted for righteousness; and if we are the seed of Abraham, then we
   must also believe through hearing. For we are Israelites, who are
   convinced not by signs, but by hearing. Wherefore it is said, "Rejoice,
   O barren, that barest not; break forth and cry, thou that didst not
   travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than of
   her who hath an husband." [2216] "Thou hast lived for the fence of the
   people, thy children were blessed in the tents of their fathers."
   [2217] And if the same mansions are promised by prophecy to us and to
   the patriarchs, the God of both the covenants is shown to be one.
   Accordingly it is added more clearly, "Thou hast inherited the covenant
   of Israel," [2218] speaking to those called from among the nations,
   that were once barren, being formerly destitute of this husband, who is
   the Word,--desolate formerly,--of the bridegroom. "Now the just shall
   live by faith," [2219] which is according to the covenant and the
   commandments; since these, which are two in name and time, given in
   accordance with the [divine] economy--being in power one--the old and
   the new, are dispensed through the Son by one God. As the apostle also
   says in the Epistle to the Romans, "For therein is the righteousness of
   God revealed from faith to faith," teaching the one salvation which
   from prophecy to the Gospel is perfected by one and the same Lord.
   "This charge," he says, "I commit to thee, son Timothy, according to
   the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest
   war the good warfare; holding faith, and a good conscience; which some
   having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck," [2220] because
   they defiled by unbelief the conscience that comes from God.
   Accordingly, faith may not, any more, with reason, be disparaged in an
   offhand way, as simple and vulgar, appertaining to anybody. For, if it
   were a mere human habit, as the Greeks supposed, it would have been
   extinguished. But if it grow, and there be no place where it is not;
   then I affirm, that faith, whether founded in love, or in fear, as its
   disparagers assert, is something divine; which is neither rent asunder
   by other mundane friendship, nor dissolved by the presence of fear. For
   love, on account of its friendly alliance with faith, makes men
   believers; and faith, which is the foundation of love, in its turn
   introduces the doing of good; since also fear, the pædagogue of the
   law, is believed to be fear by those, by whom it is believed. For, if
   its existence is shown in its working, it is yet believed when about to
   do and threatening, and when not working and present; and being
   believed to exist, it does not itself generate faith, but is by faith
   tested and proved trustworthy. Such a change, then, from unbelief to
   faith--and to trust in hope and fear, is divine. And, in truth, faith
   is discovered, by us, to be the first movement towards salvation; after
   which fear, and hope, and repentance, advancing in company with
   temperance and patience, lead us to love and knowledge. Rightly,
   therefore, the Apostle Barnabas says, "From the portion I have received
   I have done my diligence to send by little and little to you; that
   along with your faith you may also have perfect knowledge. [2221] Fear
   and patience are then helpers of your faith; and our allies are
   long-suffering and temperance. These, then," he says, "in what respects
   the Lord, continuing in purity, there rejoice along with them, wisdom,
   understanding, intelligence, knowledge." The fore-mentioned virtues
   being, then, the elements of knowledge; the result is that faith is
   more elementary, being as necessary to the Gnostic, [2222] as
   respiration to him that lives in this world is to life. And as without
   the four elements it is not possible to live, so neither can knowledge
   be attained without faith. It is then the support of truth.

      Chapter VII.--The Utility of Fear. Objections Answered.

   Those, who denounce fear, assail the law; and if the law, plainly also
   God, who gave the law. For these three elements are of necessity
   presented in the subject on hand: the ruler, his administration, and
   the ruled. If, then, according to hypothesis, they abolish the law;
   then, by necessary consequence, each one who is led by lust, courting
   pleasure, must neglect what is right and despise the Deity, and
   fearlessly indulge in impiety and injustice together, having dashed
   away from the truth.

   Yea, say they, fear is an irrational aberration, [2223] and
   perturbation of mind. What sayest thou? And how can this definition be
   any longer maintained, seeing the commandment is given me by the Word?
   But the commandment forbids, hanging fear over the head of those who
   have incurred [2224] admonition for their discipline.

   Fear is not then irrational. It is therefore rational. How could it be
   otherwise, exhorting as it does, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not
   commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Than shalt not bear false
   witness? But if they will quibble about the names, let the philosophers
   term the fear of the law, cautious fear, (eulabeia) which is a shunning
   (ekklisis) agreeable to reason. Such Critolaus of Phasela not inaptly
   called fighters about names (onomatomakoi). The commandment, then, has
   already appeared fair and lovely even in the highest degree, when
   conceived under a change of name. Cautious fear (eulabeia) is therefore
   shown to be reasonable, being the shunning of what hurts; from which
   arises repentance for previous sins. "For the fear of the Lord is the
   beginning of wisdom; good understanding is to all that do it." [2225]
   He calls wisdom a doing, which is the fear of the Lord paving the way
   for wisdom. But if the law produces fear, the knowledge of the law is
   the beginning of wisdom; and a man is not wise without law. Therefore
   those who reject the law are unwise; and in consequence they are
   reckoned godless (atheoi). Now instruction is the beginning of wisdom.
   "But the ungodly despise wisdom and instruction," [2226] saith the
   Scripture.

   Let us see what terrors the law announces. If it is the things which
   hold an intermediate place between virtue and vice, such as poverty,
   disease, obscurity, and humble birth, and the like, these things civil
   laws hold forth, and are praised for so doing. And those of the
   Peripatetic school, who introduce three kinds of good things, and think
   that their opposites are evil, this opinion suits. But the law given to
   us enjoins us to shun what are in reality bad things--adultery,
   uncleanness, pæderasty, ignorance, wickedness, soul-disease, death (not
   that which severs the soul from the body, but that which severs the
   soul from truth). For these are vices in reality, and the workings that
   proceed from them are dreadful and terrible. "For not unjustly," say
   the divine oracles, "are the nets spread for birds; for they who are
   accomplices in blood treasure up evils to themselves." [2227] How,
   then, is the law still said to be not good by certain heresies that
   clamorously appeal to the apostle, who says, "For by the law is the
   knowledge of sin?" [2228] To whom we say, The law did not cause, but
   showed sin. For, enjoining what is to be done, it reprehended what
   ought not to be done. And it is the part of the good to teach what is
   salutary, and to point out what is deleterious; and to counsel the
   practice of the one, and to command to shun the other. Now the apostle,
   whom they do not comprehend, said that by the law the knowledge of sin
   was manifested, not that from it it derived its existence. And how can
   the law be not good, which trains, which is given as the instructor
   (paidagogos) to Christ, [2229] that being corrected by fear, in the way
   of discipline, in order to the attainment of the perfection which is by
   Christ? "I will not," it is said, "the death of the sinner, as his
   repentance." [2230] Now the commandment works repentance; inasmuch as
   it deters [2231] from what ought not to be done, and enjoins good
   deeds. By ignorance he means, in my opinion, death. "And he that is
   near the Lord is full of stripes." [2232] Plainly, he, that draws near
   to knowledge, has the benefit of perils, fears, troubles, afflictions,
   by reason of his desire for the truth. "For the son who is instructed
   turns out wise, and an intelligent son is saved from burning. And an
   intelligent son will receive the commandments." [2233] And Barnabas the
   apostle having said, "Woe to those who are wise in their own conceits,
   clever in their own eyes," [2234] added, "Let us become spiritual, a
   perfect temple to God; let us, as far as in us lies, practice the fear
   of God, and strive to keep His commands, that we may rejoice in His
   judgments." [2235] Whence "the fear of God" is divinely said to be the
   beginning of wisdom. [2236]

      Chapter VIII.--The Vagaries of Basilides and Valentinus as to Fear Being
      the Cause of Things.

   Here the followers of Basilides, interpreting this expression, say,
   "that the Prince, [2237] having heard the speech of the Spirit, who was
   being ministered to, was struck with amazement both with the voice and
   the vision, having had glad tidings beyond his hopes announced to him;
   and that his amazement was called fear, which became the origin of
   wisdom, which distinguishes classes, and discriminates, and perfects,
   and restores. For not the world alone, but also the election, He that
   is over all has set apart and sent forth."

   And Valentinus appears also in an epistle to have adopted such views.
   For he writes in these very words: "And as [2238] terror fell on the
   angels at this creature, because he uttered things greater than
   proceeded from his formation, by reason of the being in him who had
   invisibly communicated a germ of the supernal essence, and who spoke
   with free utterance; so also among the tribes of men in the world, the
   works of men became terrors to those who made them,--as, for example,
   images and statues. And the hands of all fashion things to bear the
   name of God: for Adam formed into the name of man inspired the dread
   attaching to the pre-existent man, as having his being in him; and they
   were terror-stricken, and speedily marred the work."

   But there being but one First Cause, as will be shown afterwards, these
   men will be shown to be inventors of chatterings and chirpings. But
   since God deemed it advantageous, that from the law and the prophets,
   men should receive a preparatory discipline by the Lord, the fear of
   the Lord was called the beginning of wisdom, being given by the Lord,
   through Moses, to the disobedient and hard of heart. For those whom
   reason convinces not, fear tames; which also the Instructing Word,
   foreseeing from the first, and purifying by each of these methods,
   adapted the instrument suitably for piety. Consternation is, then, fear
   at a strange apparition, or at an unlooked-for representation--such as,
   for example, a message; while fear is an excessive wonderment on
   account of something which arises or is. They do not then perceive that
   they represent by means of amazement the God who is highest and is
   extolled by them, as subject to perturbation and antecedent to
   amazement as having been in ignorance. If indeed ignorance preceded
   amazement; and if this amazement and fear, which is the beginning of
   wisdom, is the fear of God, then in all likelihood ignorance as cause
   preceded both the wisdom of God and all creative work, and not only
   these, but restoration and even election itself. Whether, then, was it
   ignorance of what was good or what was evil?

   Well, if of good, why does it cease through amazement? And minister and
   preaching and baptism are [in that case] superfluous to them. And if of
   evil, how can what is bad be the cause of what is best? For had not
   ignorance preceded, the minister would not have come down, nor would
   have amazement seized on "the Prince," as they say; nor would he have
   attained to a beginning of wisdom from fear, in order to discrimination
   between the elect and those that are mundane. And if the fear of the
   pre-existent man made the angels conspire against their own handiwork,
   under the idea that an invisible germ of the supernal essence was
   lodged within that creation, or through unfounded suspicion excited
   envy, which is incredible, the angels became murderers of the creature
   which had been entrusted to them, as a child might be, they being thus
   convicted of the grossest ignorance. Or suppose they were influenced by
   being involved in foreknowledge. But they would not have conspired
   against what they foreknew in the assault they made; nor would they
   have been terror-struck at their own work, in consequence of
   foreknowledge, on their perceiving the supernal germ. Or, finally,
   suppose, trusting to their knowledge, they dared (but this also were
   impossible for them), on learning the excellence that is in the
   Pleroma, to conspire against man. Furthermore also they laid hands on
   that which was according to the image, in which also is the archetype,
   and which, along with the knowledge that remains, is indestructible.

   To these, then, and certain others, especially the Marcionites, the
   Scripture cries, though they listen not, "He that heareth Me shall rest
   with confidence in peace, and shall be tranquil, fearless of all evil."
   [2239]

   What, then, will they have the law to be? They will not call it evil,
   but just; distinguishing what is good from what is just. But the Lord,
   when He enjoins us to dread evil, does not exchange one evil for
   another, but abolishes what is opposite by its opposite. Now evil is
   the opposite of good, as what is just is of what is unjust. If, then,
   that absence of fear, which the fear of the Lord produces, is called
   the beginning of what is good, [2240] fear is a good thing. And the
   fear which proceeds from the law is not only just, but good, as it
   takes away evil. But introducing absence of fear by means of fear, it
   does not produce apathy by means of mental perturbation, but moderation
   of feeling by discipline. When, then, we hear, "Honour the Lord, and be
   strong: but fear not another besides Him," [2241] we understand it to
   be meant fearing to sin, and following the commandments given by God,
   which is the honour that cometh from God. For the fear of God is Deos
   [in Greek]. But if fear is perturbation of mind, as some will have it
   that fear is perturbation of mind, yet all fear is not perturbation.
   Superstition is indeed perturbation of mind; being the fear of demons,
   that produce and are subject to the excitement of passion. On the other
   hand, consequently, the fear of God, who is not subject to
   perturbation, is free of perturbation. For it is not God, but falling
   away from God, that the man is terrified for. And he who fears
   this--that is, falling into evils--fears and dreads those evils. And he
   who fears a fall, wishes himself to be free of corruption and
   perturbation. "The wise man, fearing, avoids evil: but the foolish,
   trusting, mixes himself with it," says the Scripture; and again it
   says, "In the fear of the Lord is the hope of strength." [2242]

      Chapter IX.--The Connection of the Christian Virtues.

   Such a fear, accordingly, leads to repentance and hope. Now hope is the
   expectation of good things, or an expectation sanguine of absent good;
   and favourable circumstances are assumed in order to good hope, which
   we have learned leads on to love. Now love turns out to be consent in
   what pertains to reason, life, and manners, or in brief, fellowship in
   life, or it is the intensity of friendship and of affection, with right
   reason, in the enjoyment of associates. And an associate (hetairos) is
   another self; [2243] just as we call those, brethren, who are
   regenerated by the same word. And akin to love is hospitality, being a
   congenial art devoted to the treatment of strangers. And those are
   strangers, to whom the things of the world are strange. For we regard
   as worldly those, who hope in the earth and carnal lusts. "Be not
   conformed," says the apostle, "to this world: but be ye transformed in
   the renewal of the mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
   acceptable, and perfect, will of God." [2244]

   Hospitality, therefore, is occupied in what is useful for strangers;
   and guests (epixenoi) are strangers (xenoi); and friends are guests;
   and brethren are friends. "Dear brother," [2245] says Homer.

   Philanthropy, in order to which also, is natural affection, being a
   loving treatment of men, and natural affection, which is a congenial
   habit exercised in the love of friends or domestics, follow in the
   train of love. And if the real man within us is the spiritual,
   philanthropy is brotherly love to those who participate, in the same
   spirit. Natural affection, on the other hand, is the preservation of
   good-will, or of affection; and affection is its perfect demonstration;
   [2246] and to be beloved is to please in behaviour, by drawing and
   attracting. And persons are brought to sameness by consent, which is
   the knowledge of the good things that are enjoyed in common. For
   community of sentiment (homognomosune) is harmony of opinions
   (sumphonia gnomon). "Let your love be without dissimulation," it is
   said; "and abhorring what is evil, let us become attached to what is
   good, to brotherly love," and so on, down to "If it be possible, as
   much as lieth in you, living peaceably with all men." Then "be not
   overcome of evil," it is said, "but overcome evil with good." [2247]
   And the same apostle owns that he bears witness to the Jews, "that they
   have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For, being ignorant
   of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they have
   not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God." [2248] For they
   did not know and do the will of the law; but what they supposed, that
   they thought the law wished. And they did not believe the law as
   prophesying, but the bare word; and they followed through fear, not
   through disposition and faith. "For Christ is the end of the law for
   righteousness," [2249] who was prophesied by the law to every one that
   believeth. Whence it was said to them by Moses, "I will provoke you to
   jealousy by them that are not a people; and I will anger you by a
   foolish nation, that is, by one that has become disposed to obedience."
   [2250] And by Isaiah it is said, "I was found of them that sought Me
   not; I was made manifest to them that inquired not after Me," [2251]
   --manifestly previous to the coming of the Lord; after which to Israel,
   the things prophesied, are now appropriately spoken: "I have stretched
   out My hands all the day long to a disobedient and gainsaying people."
   Do you see the cause of the calling from among the nations, clearly
   declared, by the prophet, to be the disobedience and gainsaying of the
   people? Then the goodness of God is shown also in their case. For the
   apostle says, "But through their transgression salvation is come to the
   Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy" [2252] and to willingness to
   repent. And the Shepherd, speaking plainly of those who had fallen
   asleep, recognises certain righteous among Gentiles and Jews, not only
   before the appearance of Christ, but before the law, in virtue of
   acceptance before God,--as Abel, as Noah, as any other righteous man.
   He says accordingly, "that the apostles and teachers, who had preached
   the name of the Son of God, and had fallen asleep, in power and by
   faith, preached to those that had fallen asleep before." Then he
   subjoins: "And they gave them the seal of preaching. They descended,
   therefore, with them into the water, and again ascended. But these
   descended alive, and again ascended alive. But those, who had fallen
   asleep before, descended dead, but ascended alive. By these, therefore,
   they were made alive, and knew the name of the Son of God. Wherefore
   also they ascended with them, and fitted into the structure of the
   tower, and unhewn were built up together; they fell asleep in
   righteousness and in great purity, but wanted only this seal." [2253]
   "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things
   of the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves,"
   [2254] according to the apostle.

   As, then, the virtues follow one another, why need I say what has been
   demonstrated already, that faith hopes through repentance, and fear
   through faith; and patience and practice in these along with learning
   terminate in love, which is perfected by knowledge? But that is
   necessarily to be noticed, that the Divine alone is to be regarded as
   naturally wise. Therefore also wisdom, which has taught the truth, is
   the power of God; and in it the perfection of knowledge is embraced.
   The philosopher loves and likes the truth, being now considered as a
   friend, on account of his love, from his being a true servant. The
   beginning of knowledge is wondering at objects, as Plato says is in his
   Theætetus; and Matthew exhorting in the Traditions, says, "Wonder at
   what is before you;" laying this down first as the foundation of
   further knowledge. So also in the Gospel to the Hebrews it is written,
   "He that wonders shall reign, and he that has reigned shall rest. It is
   impossible, therefore, for an ignorant man, while he remains ignorant,
   to philosophize, not having apprehended the idea of wisdom; since
   philosophy is an effort to grasp that which truly is, and the studies
   that conduce thereto. And it is not the rendering of one [2255]
   accomplished in good habits of conduct, but the knowing how we are to
   use and act and labour, according as one is assimilated to God. I mean
   God the Saviour, by serving the God of the universe through the High
   Priest, the Word, by whom what is in truth good and right is beheld.
   Piety is conduct suitable and corresponding to God.

      Chapter X.--To What the Philosopher Applies Himself.

   These three things, therefore, our philosopher attaches himself to:
   first, speculation; second, the performance of the precepts; third, the
   forming of good men;--which, concurring, form the Gnostic. Whichever of
   these is wanting, the elements of knowledge limp. Whence the Scripture
   divinely says, "And the Lord spake to Moses, saying, Speak to the
   children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, I am the Lord your God.
   According to the customs of the land of Egypt, in which ye have dwelt,
   ye shall not do; and according to the customs of Canaan, into which I
   bring you, ye shall not do; and in their usages ye shall not walk. Ye
   shall perform My judgments, and keep My precepts, and walk in them: I
   am the Lord your God. And ye shall keep all My commandments, and do
   them. He that doeth them shall live in them. I am the Lord your God."
   [2256] Whether, then, Egypt and the land of Canaan be the symbol of the
   world and of deceit, or of sufferings and afflictions; the oracle shows
   us what must be abstained from, and what, being divine and not worldly,
   must be observed. And when it is said, "The man that doeth them shall
   live in them," [2257] it declares both the correction of the Hebrews
   themselves, and the training and advancement of us who are nigh: [2258]
   it declares at once their life and ours. For "those who were dead in
   sins are quickened together with Christ," [2259] by our covenant. For
   Scripture, by the frequent reiteration of the expression, "I am the
   Lord your God," shames in such a way as most powerfully to dissuade, by
   teaching us to follow God who gave the commandments, and gently
   admonishes us to seek God and endeavour to know Him as far as possible;
   which is the highest speculation, that which scans the greatest
   mysteries, the real knowledge, that which becomes irrefragable by
   reason. This alone is the knowledge of wisdom, from which rectitude of
   conduct is never disjoined.

      Chapter XI.--The Knowledge Which Comes Through Faith the Surest of All.

   But the knowledge of those who think themselves wise, whether the
   barbarian sects or the philosophers among the Greeks, according to the
   apostle, "puffeth up." [2260] But that knowledge, which is the
   scientific demonstration of what is delivered according to the true
   philosophy, is founded on faith. Now, we may say that it is that
   process of reason which, from what is admitted, procures faith in what
   is disputed. Now, faith being twofold--the faith of knowledge and that
   of opinion--nothing prevents us from calling demonstration twofold, the
   one resting on knowledge, the other on opinion; since also knowledge
   and foreknowledge are designated as twofold, that which is essentially
   accurate, that which is defective. And is not the demonstration, which
   we possess, that alone which is true, as being supplied out of the
   divine Scriptures, the sacred writings, and out of the "God-taught
   wisdom," according to the apostle? Learning, then, is also obedience to
   the commandments, which is faith in God. And faith is a power of God,
   being the strength of the truth. For example, it is said, "If ye have
   faith as a grain of mustard, ye shall remove the mountain." [2261] And
   again, "According to thy faith let it be to thee." [2262] And one is
   cured, receiving healing by faith; and the dead is raised up in
   consequence of the power of one believing that he would be raised. The
   demonstration, however, which rests on opinion is human, and is the
   result of rhetorical arguments or dialectic syllogisms. For the highest
   demonstration, to which we have alluded, produces intelligent faith by
   the adducing and opening up of the Scriptures to the souls of those who
   desire to learn; the result of which is knowledge (gnosis). For if what
   is adduced in order to prove the point at issue is assumed to be true,
   as being divine and prophetic, manifestly the conclusion arrived at by
   inference from it will consequently be inferred truly; and the
   legitimate result of the demonstration will be knowledge. When, then,
   the memorial of the celestial and divine food was commanded to be
   consecrated in the golden pot, it was said, "The omer was the tenth of
   the three measures." [2263] For in ourselves, by the three measures are
   indicated three criteria; sensation of objects of sense, speech,--of
   spoken names and words, and the mind,--of intellectual objects. The
   Gnostic, therefore, will abstain from errors in speech, and thought,
   and sensation, and action, having heard "that he that looks so as to
   lust hath committed adultery;" [2264] and reflecting that "blessed are
   the pure in heart, for they shall see God;" [2265] and knowing this,
   "that not what enters into the mouth defileth, but that it is what
   cometh forth by the mouth that defileth the man. For out of the heart
   proceed thoughts." [2266] This, as I think, is the true and just
   measure according to God, by which things capable of measurement are
   measured, the decad which is comprehensive of man; which summarily the
   three above-mentioned measures pointed out. There are body and soul,
   the five senses, speech, the power of reproduction--the intellectual or
   the spiritual faculty, or whatever you choose to call it. And we must,
   in a word, ascending above all the others, stop at the mind; as also
   certainly in the universe overleaping the nine divisions, the first
   consisting of the four elements put in one place for equal interchange:
   and then the seven wandering stars and the one that wanders not, the
   ninth, to the perfect number, which is above the nine, [2267] and the
   tenth division, we must reach to the knowledge of God, to speak
   briefly, desiring the Maker after the creation. Wherefore the tithes
   both of the ephah and of the sacrifices were presented to God; and the
   paschal feast began with the tenth day, being the transition from all
   trouble, and from all objects of sense.

   The Gnostic is therefore fixed by faith; but the man who thinks himself
   wise touches not what pertains to the truth, moved as he is by unstable
   and wavering impulses. It is therefore reasonably written, "Cain went
   forth from the face of God, and dwelt in the land of Naid, over against
   Eden." Now Naid is interpreted commotion, and Eden delight; and Faith,
   and Knowledge, and Peace are delight, from which he that has disobeyed
   is cast out. But he that is wise in his own eyes will not so much as
   listen to the beginning of the divine commandments; but, as if his own
   teacher, throwing off the reins, plunges voluntarily into a billowy
   commotion, sinking down to mortal and created things from the uncreated
   knowledge, holding various opinions at various times. "Those who have
   no guidance fall like leaves." [2268]

   Reason, the governing principle, remaining unmoved and guiding the
   soul, is called its pilot. For access to the Immutable is obtained by a
   truly immutable means. Thus Abraham was stationed before the Lord, and
   approaching spoke. [2269] And to Moses it is said, "But do thou stand
   there with Me." [2270] And the followers of Simon wish be assimilated
   in manners to the standing form which they adore. Faith, therefore, and
   the knowledge of the truth, render the soul, which makes them its
   choice, always uniform and equable. For congenial to the man of
   falsehood is shifting, and change, and turning away, as to the Gnostic
   are calmness, and rest, and peace. As, then, philosophy has been
   brought into evil repute by pride and self-conceit, so also gnosis by
   false gnosis called by the same name; of which the apostle writing
   says, "O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding
   the profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science (gnosis)
   falsely so called; which some professing, have erred concerning the
   faith." [2271]

   Convicted by this utterance, the heretics reject the Epistles to
   Timothy. [2272] Well, then, if the Lord is the truth, and wisdom, and
   power of God, as in truth He is, it is shown that the real Gnostic is
   he that knows Him, and His Father by Him. For his sentiments are the
   same with him who said, "The lips of the righteous know high things."

      Chapter XII.--Twofold Faith.

   Faith as also Time being double, we shall find virtues in pairs both
   dwelling together. For memory is related to past time, hope to future.
   We believe that what is past did, and that what is future will take
   place. And, on the other hand, we love, persuaded by faith that the
   past was as it was, and by hope expecting the future. For in everything
   love attends the Gnostic, who knows one God. "And, behold, all things
   which He created were very good." [2274] He both knows and admires.
   Godliness adds length of life; and the fear of the Lord adds days. As,
   then, the days are a portion of life in its progress, so also fear is
   the beginning of love, becoming by development faith, then love. But it
   is not as I fear and hate a wild beast (since fear is twofold) that I
   fear the father, whom I fear and love at once. Again, fearing lest I be
   punished, I love myself in assuming fear. He who fears to offend his
   father, loves himself. Blessed then is he who is found possessed of
   faith, being, as he is, composed of love and fear. And faith is power
   in order to salvation, and strength to eternal life. Again, prophecy is
   foreknowledge; and knowledge the understanding of prophecy; being the
   knowledge of those things known before by the Lord who reveals all
   things.

   The knowledge, then, of those things which have been predicted shows a
   threefold result--either one that has happened long ago, or exists now,
   or about to be. Then the extremes [2275] either of what is accomplished
   or of what is hoped for fall under faith; and the present action
   furnishes persuasive arguments of the confirmation of both the
   extremes. For if, prophecy being one, one part is accomplishing and
   another is fulfilled; hence the truth, both what is hoped for and what
   is passed is confirmed. For it was first present; then it became past
   to us; so that the belief of what is past is the apprehension of a past
   event, and a hope which is future the apprehension of a future event.

   And not only the Platonists, but the Stoics, say that assent is in our
   own power. All opinion then, and judgment, and supposition, and
   knowledge, by which we live and have perpetual intercourse with the
   human race, is an assent; which is nothing else than faith. And
   unbelief being defection from faith, shows both assent and faith to be
   possessed of power; for non-existence cannot be called privation. And
   if you consider the truth, you will find man naturally misled so as to
   give assent to what is false, though possessing the resources necessary
   for belief in the truth. "The virtue, then, that encloses the Church in
   its grasp," as the Shepherd says, [2276] "is Faith, by which the elect
   of God are saved; and that which acts the man is Self-restraint. And
   these are followed by Simplicity, Knowledge, Innocence, Decorum, Love,"
   and all these are the daughters of Faith. And again, "Faith leads the
   way, fear upbuilds, and love perfects." Accordingly he [2277] says, the
   Lord is to be feared in order to edification, but not the devil to
   destruction. And again, the works of the Lord--that is, His
   commandments--are to be loved and done; but the works of the devil are
   to be dreaded and not done. For the fear of God trains and restores to
   love; but the fear of the works of the devil has hatred dwelling along
   with it. The same also says "that repentance is high intelligence. For
   he that repents of what he did, no longer does or says as he did. But
   by torturing himself for his sins, he benefits his soul. Forgiveness of
   sins is therefore different from repentance; but both show what is in
   our power."

      Chapter XIII.--On First and Second Repentance.

   He, then, who has received the forgiveness of sins ought to sin no
   more. For, in addition to the first and only repentance from sins (this
   is from the previous sins in the first and heathen life--I mean that in
   ignorance), there is forthwith proposed to those who have been called,
   the repentance which cleanses the seat of the soul from transgressions,
   that faith may be established. And the Lord, knowing the heart, and
   foreknowing the future, foresaw both the fickleness of man and the
   craft and subtlety of the devil from the first, from the beginning; how
   that, envying man for the forgiveness of sins, he would present to the
   servants of God certain causes of sins; skilfully working mischief,
   that they might fall together with himself. Accordingly, being very
   merciful, He has vouch-safed, in the case of those who, though in
   faith, fall into any transgression, a second repentance; so that should
   any one be tempted after his calling, overcome by force and fraud, he
   may receive still a repentance not to be repented of. "For if we sin
   wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there
   remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for
   of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."
   [2278] But continual and successive repentings for sins differ nothing
   from the case of those who have not believed at all, except only in
   their consciousness that they do sin. And I know not which of the two
   is worst, whether the case of a man who sins knowingly, or of one who,
   after having repented of his sins, transgresses again. For in the
   process of proof sin appears on each side,--the sin which in its
   commission is condemned by the worker of the iniquity, and that of the
   man who, foreseeing what is about to be done, yet puts his hand to it
   as a wickedness. And he who perchance gratifies himself in anger and
   pleasure, gratifies himself in he knows what; and he who, repenting of
   that in which he gratified himself, by rushing again into pleasure, is
   near neighbour to him who has sinned wilfully at first. For one, who
   does again that of which he has repented, and condemning what he does,
   performs it willingly.

   He, then, who from among the Gentiles and from that old life has
   betaken himself to faith, has obtained forgiveness of sins once. But he
   who has sinned after this, on his repentance, though he obtain pardon,
   ought to fear, as one no longer washed to the forgiveness of sins. For
   not only must the idols which he formerly held as gods, but the works
   also of his former life, be abandoned by him who has been "born again,
   not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh," [2279] but in the Spirit;
   which consists in repenting by not giving way to the same fault. For
   frequent repentance and readiness to change easily from want of
   training, is the practice of sin again. [2280] The frequent asking of
   forgiveness, then, for those things in which we often transgress, is
   the semblance of repentance, not repentance itself. "But the
   righteousness of the blameless cuts straight paths," [2281] says the
   Scripture. And again, "The righteousness of the innocent will make his
   way right." [2282] Nay, "as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord
   pitieth them that fear Him." [2283] David writes, "They who sow," then,
   "in tears, shall reap in joy;" [2284] those, namely, who confess in
   penitence. "For blessed are all those that fear the Lord." [2285] You
   see the corresponding blessing in the Gospel. "Fear not," it is said,
   "when a man is enriched, and when the glory of his house is increased:
   because when he dieth he shall leave all, and his glory shall not
   descend after him." [2286] "But I in Thy I mercy will enter into Thy
   house. I will worship toward Thy holy temple, in Thy fear: Lord, lead
   me in Thy righteousness." [2287] Appetite is then the movement of the
   mind to or from something. [2288] Passion is an excessive appetite
   exceeding the measures of reason, or appetite unbridled and disobedient
   to the word. Passions, then, are a perturbation of the soul contrary to
   nature, in disobedience to reason. But revolt and distraction and
   disobedience are in our own power, as obedience is in our power.
   Wherefore voluntary actions are judged. But should one examine each one
   of the passions, he will find them irrational impulses.

      Chapter XIV.--How a Thing May Be Involuntary.

   What is involuntary is not matter for judgment. But this is
   twofold,--what is done in ignorance, and what is done through
   necessity. For how will you judge concerning those who are said to sin
   in involuntary modes? For either one knew not himself, as Cleomenes and
   Athamas, who were mad; or the thing which he does, as Æschylus, who
   divulged the mysteries on the stage, who, being tried in the Areopagus,
   was absolved on his showing that he had not been initiated. Or one
   knows not what is done, as he who has let off his antagonist, and slain
   his domestic instead of his enemy; or that by which it is done, as he
   who, in exercising with spears having buttons on them, has killed some
   one in consequence of the spear throwing off the button; or knows not
   the manner how, as he who has killed his antagonist in the stadium, for
   it was not for his death but for victory that he contended; or knows
   not the reason why it is done, as the physician gave a salutary
   antidote and killed, for it was not for this purpose that he gave it,
   but to save. The law at that time punished him who had killed
   involuntarily, as e.g., him who was subject involuntarily to
   gonorrhoea, but not equally with him who did so voluntarily. Although
   he also shall be punished as for a voluntary action, if one transfer
   the affection to the truth. For, in reality, he that cannot contain the
   generative word is to be punished; for this is an irrational passion of
   the soul approaching garrulity. "The faithful man chooses to conceal
   things in his spirit." [2289] Things, then, that depend on choice are
   subjects for judgment. "For the Lord searcheth the hearts and reins."
   [2290] "And he that looketh so as to lust" [2291] is judged. Wherefore
   it is said, "Thou shalt not lust." [2292] And "this people honoureth Me
   with their lips," it is said, "but their heart is far from Me." [2293]
   For God has respect to the very thought, since Lot's wife, who had
   merely voluntarily turned towards worldly wickedness, He left a
   senseless mass, rendering her a pillar of salt, and fixed her so that
   she advanced no further, not as a stupid and useless image, but to
   season and salt him who has the power of spiritual perception.

      Chapter XV.--On the Different Kinds of Voluntary Actions, and the Sins
      Thence Proceeding.

   What is voluntary is either what is by desire, or what is by choice, or
   what is of intention. Closely allied to each other are these
   things--sin, mistake, crime. It is sin, for example, to live
   luxuriously and licentiously; a misfortune, to wound one's friend in
   ignorance, taking him for an enemy; and crime, to violate graves or
   commit sacrilege. Sinning arises from being unable to determine what
   ought to be done, or being unable to do it; as doubtless one falls into
   a ditch either through not knowing, or through inability to leap across
   through feebleness of body. But application to the training of
   ourselves, and subjection to the commandments, is in our own power;
   with which if we will have nothing to do, by abandoning ourselves
   wholly to lust, we shall sin, nay rather, wrong our own soul. For the
   noted Laius says in the tragedy:--


   "None of these things of which you admonish me have escaped me;

   But notwithstanding that I am in my senses, Nature compels me;"

   i.e., his abandoning himself to passion. Medea, too, herself cries on
   the stage:--


   "And I am aware what evils I am to perpetrate,

   But passion is stronger than my resolutions." [2294]

   Further, not even Ajax is silent; but, when about to kill himself,
   cries:--


   "No pain gnaws the soul of a free man like dishonour.

   Thus do I suffer; and the deep stain of calamity

   Ever stirs me from the depths, agitated

   By the bitter stings of rage." [2295]

   Anger made these the subjects of tragedy, and lust made ten thousand
   others--Phædra, Anthia, Eriphyle,--


   "Who took the precious gold for her dear husband."

   For another play represents Thrasonides of the comic drama as saying:--


   "A worthless wench made me her slave."

   Mistake is a sin contrary to calculation; and voluntary sin is crime
   (adikia); and crime is voluntary wickedness. Sin, then, is on my part
   voluntary. Wherefore says the apostle, "Sin shall not have dominion
   over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace." [2296]
   Addressing those who have believed, he says, "For by His stripes we
   were healed." [2297] Mistake is the involuntary action of another
   towards me, while a crime (adikia) alone is voluntary, whether my act
   or another's. These differences of sins are alluded to by the Psalmist,
   when he calls those blessed whose iniquities (anomias) God hath blotted
   out, and whose sins (hamartias) He hath covered. Others He does not
   impute, and the rest He forgives. For it is written, "Blessed are they
   whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the
   man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and in whose mouth there is
   no fraud." [2298] This blessedness came on those who had been chosen by
   God through Jesus Christ our Lord. For "love hides the multitude of
   sins." [2299] And they are blotted out by Him "who desireth the
   repentance rather than the death of a sinner." [2300] And those are not
   reckoned that are not the effect of choice; "for he who has lusted has
   already committed adultery," [2301] it is said. And the illuminating
   Word forgives sins: "And in that time, saith the Lord, they shall seek
   for the iniquity of Israel, and it shall not exist; and the sins of
   Judah, and they shall not be found." [2302] "For who is like Me? and
   who shall stand before My face? [2303] You see the one God declared
   good, rendering according to desert, and forgiving sins. John, too,
   manifestly teaches the differences of sins, in his larger Epistle, in
   these words: "If any man see his brother sin a sin that is not unto
   death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life: for these that sin not
   unto death," he says. For "there is a sin unto death: I do not say that
   one is to pray for it. All unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin
   not unto death." [2304]

   David, too, and Moses before David, show the knowledge of the three
   precepts in the following words: "Blessed is the man who walks not in
   the counsel of the ungodly;" as the fishes go down to the depths in
   darkness; for those which have not scales, which Moses prohibits
   touching, feed at the bottom of the sea. "Nor standeth in the way of
   sinners," as those who, while appearing to fear the Lord, commit sin,
   like the sow, for when hungry it cries, and when full knows not its
   owner. "Nor sitteth in the chair of pestilences," as birds ready for
   prey. And Moses enjoined not to eat the sow, nor the eagle, nor the
   hawk, nor the raven, nor any fish without scales. So far Barnabas.
   [2305] And I heard one skilled in such matters say that "the counsel of
   the ungodly" was the heathen, and "the way of sinners" the Jewish
   persuasion, and explain "the chair of pestilence" of heresies. And
   another said, with more propriety, that the first blessing was assigned
   to those who had not followed wicked sentiments which revolt from God;
   the second to those who do not remain in the wide and broad road,
   whether they be those who have been brought up in the law, or Gentiles
   who have repented. And "the chair of pestilences" will be the theatres
   and tribunals, or rather the compliance with wicked and deadly powers,
   and complicity with their deeds. "But his delight is in the law of the
   Lord." [2306] Peter in his Preaching called the Lord, Law and Logos.
   The legislator seems to teach differently the interpretation of the
   three forms of sin--understanding by the mute fishes sins of word, for
   there are times in which silence is better than speech, for silence has
   a safe recompense; sins of deed, by the rapacious and carnivorous
   birds. The sow delights in dirt and dung; and we ought not to have "a
   conscience" that is "defiled." [2307]

   Justly, therefore, the prophet says, "The ungodly are not so: but as
   the chaff which the wind driveth away from the face of the earth.
   Wherefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment" [2308] (being
   already condemned, for "he that believeth not is condemned already"
   [2309] ), "nor sinners in the counsel of the righteous," inasmuch as
   they are already condemned, so as not to be united to those that have
   lived without stumbling. "For the Lord knoweth the way of the
   righteous; and the way of the ungodly shall perish." [2310]

   Again, the Lord clearly shows sins and transgressions to be in our own
   power, by prescribing modes of cure corresponding to the maladies;
   showing His wish that we should be corrected by the shepherds, in
   Ezekiel; blaming, I am of opinion, some of them for not keeping the
   commandments. "That which was enfeebled ye have not strengthened," and
   so forth, down to, "and there was none to search out or turn away."
   [2311]

   For "great is the joy before the Father when one sinner is saved,"
   [2312] saith the Lord. So Abraham was much to be praised, because "he
   walked as the Lord spake to him." Drawing from this instance, one of
   the wise men among the Greeks uttered the maxim, "Follow God." [2313]
   "The godly," says Esaias, "framed wise counsels." [2314] Now counsel is
   seeking for the right way of acting in present circumstances, and good
   counsel is wisdom in our counsels. And what? Does not God, after the
   pardon bestowed on Cain, suitably not long after introduce Enoch, who
   had repented? [2315] showing that it is the nature of repentance to
   produce pardon; but pardon does not consist in remission, but in
   remedy. An instance of the same is the making of the calf by the people
   before Aaron. Thence one of the wise men among the Greeks uttered the
   maxim, "Pardon is better than punishment;" as also, "Become surety, and
   mischief is at hand," is derived from the utterance of Solomon which
   says, "My son, if thou become surety for thy friend, thou wilt give
   thine hand to thy enemy; for a man's own lips are a strong snare to
   him, and he is taken in the words of his own mouth." [2316] And the
   saying, "Know thyself," has been taken rather more mystically from
   this, "Thou hast seen thy brother, thou hast seen thy God." [2317] Thus
   also, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy
   neighbour as thyself;" for it is said, "On these commandments the law
   and the prophets hang and are suspended." [2318] With these also agree
   the following: "These things have I spoken to you, that My joy might be
   fulfilled: and this is My commandment, That ye love one another, as I
   have loved you." [2319] "For the Lord is merciful and pitiful; and
   gracious [2320] is the Lord to all." [2321] "Know thyself" is more
   clearly and often expressed by Moses, when he enjoins, "Take heed to
   thyself." [2322] "By alms then, and acts of faith, sins are purged."
   [2323] "And by the fear of the Lord each one departs from evil." [2324]
   "And the fear of the Lord is instruction and wisdom." [2325]

      Chapter XVI.--How We are to Explain the Passages of Scripture Which
      Ascribe to God Human Affections.

   Here again arise the cavillers, who say that joy and pain are passions
   of the soul: for they define joy as a rational elevation and
   exultation, as rejoicing on account of what is good; and pity as pain
   for one who suffers undeservedly; and that such affections are moods
   and passions of the soul. But we, as would appear, do not cease in such
   matters to understand the Scriptures carnally; and starting from our
   own affections, interpret the will of the impassible Deity similarly to
   our perturbations; and as we are capable of hearing; so, supposing the
   same to be the case with the Omnipotent, err impiously. For the Divine
   Being cannot be declared as it exists: but as we who are fettered in
   the flesh were able to listen, so the prophets spake to us; the Lord
   savingly accommodating Himself to the weakness of men. [2326] Since,
   then, it is the will of God that he, who is obedient to the commands
   and repents of his sins should be saved, and we rejoice on account of
   our salvation, the Lord, speaking by the prophets, appropriated our joy
   to Himself; as speaking lovingly in the Gospel He says, "I was hungry,
   and ye gave Me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me to drink. For
   inasmuch as ye did it to one of the least of these, ye did it to Me."
   [2327] As, then, He is nourished, though not personally, by the
   nourishing of one whom He wishes nourished; so He rejoices, without
   suffering change, by reason of him who has repented being in joy, as He
   wished. And since God pities richly, being good, and giving commands by
   the law and the prophets, and more nearly still by the appearance of
   his Son, saving and pitying, as was said, those who have found mercy;
   and properly the greater pities the less; and a man cannot be greater
   than man, being by nature man; but God in everything is greater than
   man; if, then, the greater pities the less, it is God alone that will
   pity us. For a man is made to communicate by righteousness, and bestows
   what he received from God, in consequence of his natural benevolence
   and relation, and the commands which he obeys. But God has no natural
   relation to us, as the authors of the heresies will have it; neither on
   the supposition of His having made us of nothing, nor on that of having
   formed us from matter; since the former did not exist at all, and the
   latter is totally distinct from God unless we shall dare to say that we
   are a part of Him, and of the same essence as God. And I know not how
   one, who knows God, can bear to hear this when he looks to our life,
   and sees in what evils we are involved. For thus it would turn out,
   which it were impiety to utter, that God sinned in [certain] portions,
   if the portions are parts of the whole and complementary of the whole;
   and if not complementary, neither can they be parts. But God being by
   nature rich in pity, in consequence of His own goodness, cares for us,
   though neither portions of Himself, nor by nature His children. And
   this is the greatest proof of the goodness of God: that such being our
   relation to Him, and being by nature wholly estranged, He nevertheless
   cares for us. For the affection in animals to their progeny is natural,
   and the friendship of kindred minds is the result of intimacy. But the
   mercy of God is rich toward us, who are in no respect related to Him; I
   say either in our essence or nature, or in the peculiar energy of our
   essence, but only in our being the work of His will. And him who
   willingly, with discipline and teaching, accepts the knowledge of the
   truth, He calls to adoption, which is the greatest advancement of all.
   "Transgressions catch a man; and in the cords of his own sins each one
   is bound." [2328] And God is without blame. And in reality, "blessed is
   the man who feareth alway through piety." [2329]

      Chapter XVII.--On the Various Kinds of Knowledge.

   As, then, Knowledge (episteme) is an intellectual state, from which
   results the act of knowing, and becomes apprehension irrefragable by
   reason; so also ignorance is a receding impression, which can be
   dislodged by reason. And that which is overthrown as well as that which
   is elaborated by reason, is in our power. Akin to Knowledge is
   experience, cognition (eidesis), Comprehension (sunesis), perception,
   and Science. Cognition (eidesis) is the knowledge of universals by
   species; and Experience is comprehensive knowledge, which investigates
   the nature of each thing. Perception (noesis) is the knowledge of
   intellectual objects; and Comprehension (sunesis) is the knowledge of
   what is compared, or a comparison that cannot be annulled, or the
   faculty of comparing the objects with which Judgment and Knowledge are
   occupied, both of one and each and all that goes to make up one reason.
   And Science (gnosis) is the knowledge of the thing in itself, or the
   knowledge which harmonizes with what takes place. Truth is the
   knowledge of the true; and the mental habit of truth is the knowledge
   of the things which are true. Now knowledge is constituted by the
   reason, and cannot be overthrown by another reason. [2330] What we do
   not, we do not either from not being able, or not being willing--or
   both. Accordingly we don't fly, since we neither can nor wish; we do
   not swim at present, for example, since we can indeed, but do not
   choose; and we are not as the Lord, since we wish, but cannot be: "for
   no disciple is above his master, and it is sufficient if we be as the
   master:" [2331] not in essence (for it is impossible for that, which is
   by adoption, to be equal in substance to that, which is by nature); but
   [we are as Him] only in our [2332] having been made immortal, and our
   being conversant with the contemplation of realities, and beholding the
   Father through what belongs to Him.

   Therefore volition takes the precedence of all; for the intellectual
   powers are ministers of the Will. "Will," it is said, "and thou shalt
   be able." [2333] And in the Gnostic, Will, Judgment, and Exertion are
   identical. For if the determinations are the same, the opinions and
   judgments will be the same too; so that both his words, and life, and
   conduct, are conformable to rule. "And a right heart seeketh knowledge,
   and heareth it." "God taught me wisdom, and I knew the knowledge of the
   holy." [2334]

      Chapter XVIII.--The Mosaic Law the Fountain of All Ethics, and the Source
      from Which the Greeks Drew Theirs. [2335]

   It is then clear also that all the other virtues, delineated in Moses,
   supplied the Greeks with the rudiments of the whole department of
   morals. I mean valour, and temperance, and wisdom, and justice, and
   endurance, and patience, and decorum, and self-restraint; and in
   addition to these, piety.

   But it is clear to every one that piety, which teaches to worship and
   honour, is the highest and oldest cause; and the law itself exhibits
   justice, and teaches wisdom, by abstinence from sensible images, and by
   inviting to the Maker and Father of the universe. And from this
   sentiment, as from a fountain, all intelligence increases. "For the
   sacrifices of the wicked are abomination to the Lord; but the prayers
   of the upright are acceptable before Him," [2336] since "righteousness
   is more acceptable before God than sacrifice." Such also as the
   following we find in Isaiah: "To what purpose to me is the multitude of
   your sacrifices? saith the Lord;" and the whole section. [2337] "Break
   every bond of wickedness; for this is the sacrifice that is acceptable
   to the Lord, a contrite heart that seeks its Maker." [2338] "Deceitful
   balances are abomination before God; but a just balance is acceptable
   to Him." [2339] Thence Pythagoras exhorts "not to step over the
   balance;" and the profession of heresies is called deceitful
   righteousness; and "the tongue of the unjust shall be destroyed, but
   the mouth of the righteous droppeth wisdom." [2340] "For they call the
   wise and prudent worthless." [2341] But it were tedious to adduce
   testimonies respecting these virtues, since the whole Scripture
   celebrates them. Since, then, they define manliness to be knowledge
   [2342] of things formidable, and not formidable, and what is
   intermediate; and temperance to be a state of mind which by choosing
   and avoiding preserves the judgments of wisdom; and conjoined with
   manliness is patience, which is called endurance, the knowledge of what
   is bearable and what is unbearable; and magnanimity is the knowledge
   which rises superior to circumstances. With temperance also is
   conjoined caution, which is avoidance in accordance with reason. And
   observance of the commandments, which is the innoxious keeping of them,
   is the attainment of a secure life. And there is no endurance without
   manliness, nor the exercise of self-restraint without temperance. And
   these virtues follow one another; and with whom are the sequences of
   the virtues, with him is also salvation, which is the keeping of the
   state of well-being. Rightly, therefore, in treating of these virtues,
   we shall inquire into them all; for he that has one virtue gnostically,
   by reason of their accompanying each other, has them all.
   Self-restraint is that quality which does not overstep what appears in
   accordance with right reason. He exercises self-restraint, who curbs
   the impulses that are contrary to right reason, or curbs himself so as
   not to indulge in desires contrary to right reason. Temperance, too, is
   not without manliness; since from the commandments spring both wisdom,
   which follows God who enjoins, and that which imitates the divine
   character, namely righteousness; in virtue of which, in the exercise of
   self-restraint, we address ourselves in purity to piety and the course
   of conduct thence resulting, in conformity with God; being assimilated
   to the Lord as far as is possible for us beings mortal in nature. And
   this is being just and holy with wisdom; for the Divinity needs nothing
   and suffers nothing; whence it is not, strictly speaking, capable of
   self-restraint, for it is never subjected to perturbation, over which
   to exercise control; while our nature, being capable of perturbation,
   needs self-constraint, by which disciplining itself to the need of
   little, it endeavours to approximate in character to the divine nature.
   For the good man, standing as the boundary between an immortal and a
   mortal nature, has few needs; having wants in consequence of his body,
   and his birth itself, but taught by rational self-control to want few
   things.

   What reason is there in the law's prohibiting a man from "wearing
   woman's clothing "? [2343] Is it not that it would have us to be manly,
   and not to be effeminate neither in person and actions, nor in thought
   and word? For it would have the man, that devotes himself to the truth,
   to be masculine both in acts of endurance and patience, in life,
   conduct, word, and discipline by night and by day; even if the
   necessity were to occur, of witnessing by the shedding of his blood.
   Again, it is said, "If any one who has newly built a house, and has not
   previously inhabited it; or cultivated a newly-planted vine, and not
   yet partaken of the fruit; or betrothed a virgin, and not yet married
   her;" [2344] --such the humane law orders to be relieved from military
   service: from military reasons in the first place, lest, bent on their
   desires, they turn out sluggish in war; for it is those who are
   untrammelled by passion that boldly encounter perils; and from motives
   of humanity, since, in view of the uncertainties of war, the law
   reckoned it not right that one should not enjoy his own labours, and
   another should without bestowing pains, receive what belonged to those
   who had laboured. The law seems also to point out manliness of soul, by
   enacting that he who had planted should reap the fruit, and he that
   built should inhabit, and he that had betrothed should marry: for it is
   not vain hopes which it provides for those who labour; according to the
   gnostic word: "For the hope of a good man dead or living does not
   perish," [2345] says Wisdom; "I love them that love me; and they who
   seek me shall find peace," [2346] and so forth. What then? Did not the
   women of the Midianites, by their beauty, seduce from wisdom into
   impiety, through licentiousness, the Hebrews when making war against
   them? For, having seduced them from a grave mode of life, and by their
   beauty ensnared them in wanton delights, they made them insane upon
   idol sacrifices and strange women; and overcome by women and by
   pleasure at once, they revolted from God, and revolted from the law.
   And the whole people was within a little of falling under the power of
   the enemy through female stratagem, until, when they were in peril,
   fear by its admonitions pulled them back. Then the survivors, valiantly
   undertaking the struggle for piety, got the upper hand of their foes.
   "The beginning, then, of wisdom is piety, and the knowledge of holy
   things is understanding; and to know the law is the characteristic of a
   good understanding." [2347] Those, then, who suppose the law to be
   productive of agitating fear, are neither good at understanding the
   law, nor have they in reality comprehended it; for "the fear of the
   Lord causes life, but he who errs shall be afflicted with pangs which
   knowledge views not." [2348] Accordingly, Barnabas says mystically,
   "May God who rules the universe vouchsafe also to you wisdom, and
   understanding, and science, and knowledge of His statutes, and
   patience. Be therefore God-taught, seeking what the Lord seeks from
   you, that He may find you in the day of judgment lying in wait for
   these things." "Children of love and peace," he called them
   gnostically. [2349]

   Respecting imparting and communicating, though much might be said, let
   it suffice to remark that the law prohibits a brother from taking
   usury: designating as a brother not only him who is born of the same
   parents, but also one of the same race and sentiments, and a
   participator in the same word; deeming it right not to take usury for
   money, but with open hands and heart to bestow on those who need. For
   God, the author and the dispenser of such grace, takes as suitable
   usury the most precious things to be found among men--mildness,
   gentleness, magnanimity, reputation, renown. Do you not regard this
   command as marked by philanthropy? As also the following, "To pay the
   wages of the poor daily," teaches to discharge without delay the wages
   due for service; for, as I think, the alacrity of the poor with
   reference to the future is paralyzed when he has suffered want.
   Further, it is said, "Let not the creditor enter the debtor's house to
   take the pledge with violence." But let the former ask it to be brought
   out, and let not the latter, if he have it, hesitate. [2350] And in the
   harvest the owners are prohibited from appropriating what falls from
   the handfuls; as also in reaping [the law] enjoins a part to be left
   unreaped; signally thereby training those who possess to sharing and to
   large-heartedness, by foregoing of their own to those who are in want,
   and thus providing means of subsistence for the poor. [2351] You see
   how the law proclaims at once the righteousness and goodness of God,
   who dispenses food to all ungrudgingly. And in the vintage it
   prohibited the grape-gatherers from going back again on what had been
   left, and from gathering the fallen grapes; and the same injunctions
   are given to the olive-gatherers. [2352] Besides, the tithes of the
   fruits and of the flocks taught both piety towards the Deity, and not
   covetously to grasp everything, but to communicate gifts of kindness to
   one's neighbours. For it was from these, I reckon, and from the
   first-fruits that the priests were maintained. We now therefore
   understand that we are instructed in piety, and in liberality, and in
   justice, and in humanity by the law. For does it not command the land
   to be left fallow in the seventh year, and bids the poor fearlessly use
   the fruits that grow by divine agency, nature cultivating the ground
   for behoof of all and sundry? [2353] How, then, can it be maintained
   that the law is not humane, and the teacher of righteousness? Again, in
   the fiftieth year, it ordered the same things to be performed as in the
   seventh; besides restoring to each one his own land, if from any
   circumstance he had parted with it in the meantime; setting bounds to
   the desires of those who covet possession, by measuring the period of
   enjoyment, and choosing that those who have paid the penalty of
   protracted penury should not suffer a life-long punishment. "But alms
   and acts of faith are royal guards, and blessing is on the head of him
   who bestows; and he who pities the poor shall be blessed." [2354] For
   he shows love to one like himself, because of his love to the Creator
   of the human race. The above-mentioned particulars have other
   explanations more natural, both respecting rest and the recovery of the
   inheritance; but they are not discussed at present.

   Now love is conceived in many ways, in the form of meekness, of
   mildness, of patience, of liberality, of freedom from envy, of absence
   of hatred, of forgetfulness of injuries. In all it is incapable of
   being divided or distinguished: its nature is to communicate. Again, it
   is said, "If you see the beast of your relatives, or friends, or, in
   general, of anybody you know, wandering in the wilderness, take it back
   and restore it; [2355] and if the owner be far away, keep it among your
   own till he return, and restore it." It teaches a natural
   communication, that what is found is to be regarded as a deposit, and
   that we are not to bear malice to an enemy. "The command of the Lord
   being a fountain of life" truly, "causeth to turn away from the snare
   of death." [2356] And what? Does it not command us "to love strangers
   not only as friends and relatives, but as ourselves, both in body and
   soul?" [2357] Nay more, it honoured the nations, and bears no grudge
   [2358] against those who have done ill. Accordingly it is expressly
   said, "Thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, for thou wast a sojourner in
   Egypt;" [2359] designating by the term Egyptian either one of that
   race, or any one in the world. And enemies, although drawn up before
   the walls attempting to take the city, are not to be regarded as
   enemies till they are by the voice of the herald summoned to peace.
   [2360]

   Further, it forbids intercourse with a female captive so as to
   dishonour her. "But allow her," it says, "thirty days to mourn
   according to her wish, and changing her clothes, associate with her as
   your lawful wife." [2361] For it regards it not right that this should
   take place either in wantonness or for hire like harlots, but only for
   the birth of children. Do you see humanity combined with continence?
   The master who has fallen in love with his captive maid it does not
   allow to gratify his pleasure, but puts a check on his lust by
   specifying an interval of time; and further, it cuts off the captive's
   hair, in order to shame disgraceful love: for if it is reason that
   induces him to marry, he will cleave to her even after she has become
   disfigured. Then if one, after his lust, does not care to consort any
   longer with the captive, it ordains that it shall not be lawful to sell
   her, or to have her any longer as a servant, but desires her to be
   freed and released from service, lest on the introduction of another
   wife she bear any of the intolerable miseries caused through jealousy.

   What more? The Lord enjoins to ease and raise up the beasts of enemies
   when labouring beneath their burdens; remotely teaching us not to
   indulge in joy at our neighbour's ills, or exult over our enemies; in
   order to teach those who are trained in these things to pray for their
   enemies. For He does not allow us either to grieve at our neighbour's
   good, or to reap joy at our neighbour's ill. And if you find any
   enemy's beast straying, you are to pass over the incentives of
   difference, and take it back and restore it. For oblivion of injuries
   is followed by goodness, and the latter by dissolution of enmity. From
   this we are fitted for agreement, and this conducts to felicity. And
   should you suppose one habitually hostile, and discover him to be
   unreasonably mistaken either through lust or anger, turn him to
   goodness. Does the law then which conducts to Christ appear humane and
   mild? And does not the same God, good, while characterized by
   righteousness from the beginning to the end, employ each kind suitably
   in order to salvation? "Be merciful," says the Lord, "that you may
   receive mercy; forgive, that you may be forgiven. As ye do, so shall it
   be done to you; as ye give, so shall it be given to you; as ye judge,
   so shall ye be judged; as ye show kindness, so shall kindness be shown
   to you: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again."
   [2362] Furthermore, [the law] prohibits those, who are in servitude for
   their subsistence, to be branded with disgrace; and to those, who have
   been reduced to slavery through money borrowed, it gives a complete
   release in the seventh year. Further, it prohibits suppliants from
   being given up to punishment. True above all, then, is that oracle. "As
   gold and silver are tried in the furnace, so the Lord chooseth men's
   hearts. The merciful man is long-suffering; and in every one who shows
   solicitude there is wisdom. For on a wise man solicitude will fall; and
   exercising thought, he will seek life; and he who seeketh God shall
   find knowledge with righteousness. And they who have sought Him rightly
   have found peace." [2363] And Pythagoras seems to me, to have derived
   his mildness towards irrational creatures from the law. For instance,
   he interdicted the immediate use of the young in the flocks of sheep,
   and goats, and herds of cattle, on the instant of their birth; not even
   on the pretext of sacrifice allowing it, both on account of the young
   ones and of the mothers; training man to gentleness by what is beneath
   him, by means of the irrational creatures. "Resign accordingly," he
   says, "the young one to its dam for even the first seven days." For if
   nothing takes place without a cause, and milk comes in a shower to
   animals in parturition for the sustenance of the progeny, he that tears
   that, which has been brought forth, away from the supply of the milk,
   dishonours nature. Let the Greeks, then, feel ashamed, and whoever else
   inveighs against the law; since it shows mildness in the case of the
   irrational creatures, while they expose the offspring of men; though
   long ago and prophetically, the law, in the above-mentioned
   commandment, threw a check in the way of their cruelty. For if it
   prohibits the progeny of the irrational creatures to be separated from
   the dam before sucking, much more in the case of men does it provide
   beforehand a cure for cruelty and savageness of disposition; so that
   even if they despise nature, they may not despise teaching. For they
   are permitted to satiate themselves with kids and lambs, and perhaps
   there might be some excuse for separating the progeny from its dam. But
   what cause is there for the exposure of a child? For the man who did
   not desire to beget children had no right to marry at first; certainly
   not to have become, through licentious indulgence, the murderer of his
   children. Again, the humane law forbids slaying the offspring and the
   dam together on the same day. Thence also the Romans, in the case of a
   pregnant woman being condemned to death, do not allow her to undergo
   punishment till she is delivered. The law too, expressly prohibits the
   slaying of such animals as are pregnant till they have brought forth,
   remotely restraining the proneness of man to do wrong to man. Thus also
   it has extended its clemency to the irrational creatures; that from the
   exercise of humanity in the case of creatures of different species, we
   might practice among those of the same species a large abundance of it.
   Those, too, that kick the bellies of certain animals before
   parturition, in order to feast on flesh mixed with milk, make the womb
   created for the birth of the foetus its grave, though the law expressly
   commands, "But neither shalt thou seethe a lamb in its mother's milk."
   [2364] For the nourishment of the living animal, it is meant, may not
   become sauce for that which has been deprived of life; and that, which
   is the cause of life, may not co-operate in the consumption of the
   body. And the same law commands "not to muzzle the ox which treadeth
   out the corn: for the labourer must be reckoned worthy of his food."
   [2365]

   And it prohibits an ox and ass to be yoked in the plough together;
   [2366] pointing perhaps to the want of agreement in the case of the
   animals; and at the same time teaching not to wrong any one belonging
   to another race, and bring him under the yoke, when there is no other
   cause to allege than difference of race, which is no cause at all,
   being neither wickedness nor the effect of wickedness. To me the
   allegory also seems to signify that the husbandry of the Word is not to
   be assigned equally to the clean and the unclean, the believer and the
   unbeliever; for the ox is clean, but the ass has been reckoned among
   the unclean animals. But the benignant Word, abounding in humanity,
   teaches that neither is it right to cut down cultivated trees, or to
   cut down the grain before the harvest, for mischiefs sake; nor that
   cultivated fruit is to be destroyed at all--either the fruit of the
   soil or that of the soul: for it does not permit the enemy's country to
   be laid waste.

   Further, husbandmen derived advantage from the law in such things. For
   it orders newly planted trees to be nourished three years in
   succession, and the superfluous growths to be cut off, to prevent them
   being loaded and pressed down; and to prevent their strength being
   exhausted from want, by the nutriment being frittered away, enjoins
   tilling and digging round them, so that [the tree] may not, by sending
   out suckers, hinder its growth. And it does not allow imperfect fruit
   to be plucked from immature trees, but after three years, in the fourth
   year; dedicating the first-fruits to God after the tree has attained
   maturity.

   This type of husbandry may serve as a mode of instruction, teaching
   that we must cut the growths of sins, and the useless weeds of the mind
   that spring up round the vital fruit, till the shoot of faith is
   perfected and becomes strong. [2367] For in the fourth year, since
   there is need of time to him that is being solidly catechized, the four
   virtues are consecrated to God, the third alone being already joined to
   the fourth, [2368] the person of the Lord. And a sacrifice of praise is
   above holocausts: "for He," it is said, "giveth strength to get power."
   [2369] And if your affairs are in the sunshine of prosperity, get and
   keep strength, and acquire power in knowledge. For by these instances
   it is shown that both good things and gifts are supplied by God; and
   that we, becoming ministers of the divine grace, ought to sow the
   benefits of God, and make those who approach us noble and good; so
   that, as far as possible, the temperate man may make others continent,
   he that is manly may make them noble, he that is wise may make them
   intelligent, and the just may make them just.

      Chapter XIX.--The True Gnostic is an Imitator of God, Especially in
      Beneficence.

   He is the Gnostic, who is after the image and likeness of God, who
   imitates God as far as possible, deficient in none of the things which
   contribute to the likeness as far as compatible, practising
   self-restraint and endurance, living righteously, reigning over the
   passions, bestowing of what he has as far as possible, and doing good
   both by word and deed. "He is the greatest," it is said, "in the
   kingdom who shall do and teach;" [2370] imitating God in conferring
   like benefits. For God's gifts are for the common good. "Whoever shall
   attempt to do aught with presumption, provokes God," [2371] it is said.
   For haughtiness is a vice of the soul, of which, as of other sins, He
   commands us to repent; by adjusting our lives from their state of
   derangement to the change for the better in these three things--mouth,
   heart, hands. These are signs--the hands of action, the heart of
   volition, the mouth of speech. Beautifully, therefore, has this oracle
   been spoken with respect to penitents: "Thou hast chosen God this day
   to be thy God; and God hath chosen thee this day to be His people."
   [2372] For him who hastes to serve the self-existent One, being a
   suppliant, [2373] God adopts to Himself; and though he be only one in
   number, he is honoured equally with the people. For being a part of the
   people, he becomes complementary of it, being restored from what he
   was; and the whole is named from a part.

   But nobility is itself exhibited in choosing and practising what is
   best. For what benefit to Adam was such a nobility as he had? No mortal
   was his father; for he himself was father of men that are born. What is
   base he readily chose, following his wife, and neglected what is true
   and good; on which account he exchanged his immortal life for a mortal
   life, but not for ever. And Noah, whose origin was not the same as
   Adam's, was saved by divine care. For he took and consecrated himself
   to God. And Abraham, who had children by three wives, not for the
   indulgence of pleasure, but in the hope, as I think, of multiplying the
   race at the first, was succeeded by one alone, who was heir of his
   father's blessings, while the rest were separated from the family; and
   of the twins who sprang from him, the younger having won his father's
   favour and received his prayers, became heir, and the elder served him.
   For it is the greatest boon to a bad man not to be master of himself.
   [2374]

   And this arrangement was prophetical and typical. And that all things
   belong to the wise, Scripture clearly indicates when it is said,
   "Because God hath had mercy on me, I have all things." [2375] For it
   teaches that we are to desire one thing, by which are all things, and
   what is promised is assigned to the worthy. Accordingly, the good man
   who has become heir of the kingdom, it registers also as
   fellow-citizen, through divine wisdom, with the righteous of the olden
   time, who under the law and before the law lived according to law,
   whose deeds have become laws to us; and again, teaching that the wise
   man is king, introduces people of a different race, saying to him,
   "Thou art a king before God among us;" [2376] those who were governed
   obeying the good man of their own accord, from admiration of his
   virtue.

   Now Plato the philosopher, defining the end of happiness, says that it
   is likeness to God as far as possible; whether concurring with the
   precept of the law (for great natures that are free of passions somehow
   hit the mark respecting the truth, as the Pythagorean Philo says in
   relating the history of Moses), or whether instructed by certain
   oracles of the time, thirsting as he always was for instruction. For
   the law says, "Walk after the Lord your God, and keep my commandments."
   [2377] For the law calls assimilation following; and such a following
   to the utmost of its power assimilates. "Be," says the Lord, "merciful
   and pitiful, as your heavenly Father is pitiful." [2378] Thence also
   the Stoics have laid down the doctrine, that living agreeably to nature
   is the end, fitly altering the name of God into nature; since also
   nature extends to plants, to seeds, to trees, and to stones. It is
   therefore plainly said, "Bad men do not understand the law; but they
   who love the law fortify themselves with a wall." [2379] "For the
   wisdom of the clever knows its ways; but the folly of the foolish is in
   error." [2380] "For on whom will I look, but on him who is mild and
   gentle, and trembleth at my words?" says the prophecy.

   We are taught that there are three kinds of friendship: and that of
   these the first and the best is that which results from virtue, for the
   love that is founded on reason is firm; that the second and
   intermediate is by way of recompense, and is social, liberal, and
   useful for life; for the friendship which is the result of favour is
   mutual. And the third and last we assert to be that which is founded on
   intimacy; others, again, that it is that variable and changeable form
   which rests on pleasure. And Hippodamus the Pythagorean seems to me to
   describe friendships most admirably: "That founded on knowledge of the
   gods, that founded on the gifts of men, and that on the pleasures of
   animals." There is the friendship of a philosopher,--that of a man and
   that of an animal. For the image of God is really the man who does
   good, in which also he gets good: as the pilot at once saves, and is
   saved. Wherefore, when one obtains his request, he does not say to the
   giver, Thou hast given well, but, Thou hast received well. So he
   receives who gives, and he gives who receives. "But the righteous pity
   and show mercy." [2381] "But the mild shall be inhabitants of the
   earth, and the innocent shall be left in it. But the transgressors
   shall be extirpated from it." [2382] And Homer seems to me to have said
   prophetically of the faithful, "Give to thy friend." And an enemy must
   be aided, that he may not continue an enemy. For by help good feeling
   is compacted, and enmity dissolved. "But if there be present readiness
   of mind, according to what a man hath it is acceptable, and not
   according to what he hath not: for it is not that there be ease to
   others, but tribulation to you, but of equality at the present time,"
   and so forth. [2383] "He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his
   righteousness endureth for ever," the Scripture says. [2384] For
   conformity with the image and likeness is not meant of the body (for it
   were wrong for what is mortal to be made like what is immortal), but in
   mind and reason, on which fitly the Lord impresses the seal of
   likeness, both in respect of doing good and of exercising rule. For
   governments are directed not by corporeal qualities, but by judgments
   of the mind. For by the counsels of holy men states are managed well,
   and the household also.

      Chapter XX.--The True Gnostic Exercises Patience and Self-Restraint.

   Endurance also itself forces its way to the divine likeness, reaping as
   its fruit impassibility through patience, if what is related of Ananias
   be kept in mind; who belonged to a number, of whom Daniel the prophet,
   filled with divine faith, was one. Daniel dwelt at Babylon, as Lot at
   Sodom, and Abraham, who a little after became the friend of God, in the
   land of Chaldea. The king of the Babylonians let Daniel down into a pit
   full of wild beasts; the King of all, the faithful Lord, took him up
   unharmed. Such patience will the Gnostic, as a Gnostic, possess. He
   will bless when under trial, like the noble Job; like Jonas, when
   swallowed up by the whale, he will pray, and faith will restore him to
   prophesy to the Ninevites; and though shut up with lions, he will tame
   the wild beasts; though cast into the fire, he will be besprinkled with
   dew, but not consumed. He will give his testimony by night; he will
   testify by day; by word, by life, by conduct, he will testify. Dwelling
   with the Lord [2385] he will continue his familiar friend, sharing the
   same hearth according to the Spirit; pure in the flesh, pure in heart,
   sanctified in word. "The world," it is said, "is crucified to him, and
   he to the world." [2386] He, bearing about the cross of the Saviour,
   will follow the Lord's footsteps, as God, having become holy of holies.

   The divine law, then, while keeping in mind all virtue, trains man
   especially to self-restraint, laying this as the foundation of the
   virtues; and disciplines us beforehand to the attainment of
   self-restraint by forbidding us to partake of such things as are by
   nature fat, as the breed of swine, which is full-fleshed. For such a
   use is assigned to epicures. It is accordingly said that one of the
   philosophers, giving the etymology of hus (sow), said that it was thus,
   as being fit only for slaughter (thusin) and killing; for life was
   given to this animal for no other purpose than that it might swell in
   flesh. Similarly, repressing our desires, it forbade partaking of
   fishes which have neither fins nor scales; for these surpass other
   fishes in fleshiness and fatness. From this it was, in my opinion, that
   the mysteries not only prohibited touching certain animals, but also
   withdrew certain parts of those slain in sacrifice, for reasons which
   are known to the initiated. If, then, we are to exercise control over
   the belly, and what is below the belly, it is clear that we have of old
   heard from the Lord that we are to check lust by the law.

   And this will be completely effected, if we unfeignedly condemn what is
   the fuel of lust: I mean pleasure. Now they say that the idea of it is
   a gentle and bland excitement, accompanied with some sensation.
   Enthralled by this, Menelaus, they say, after the capture of Troy,
   having rushed to put Helen to death, as having been the cause of such
   calamities, was nevertheless not able to effect it, being subdued by
   her beauty, which made him think of pleasure. Whence the tragedians,
   jeering, exclaimed insultingly against him:--


   "But thou, when on her breast thou lookedst, thy sword

   Didst cast away, and with a kiss the traitress,

   Ever-beauteous wretch, [2387] thou didst embrace."

   And again:--


   "Was the sword then by beauty blunted?"

   And I agree with Antisthenes when he says, "Could I catch Aphrodite, I
   would shoot her; for she has destroyed many of our beautiful and good
   women." And he says that "Love [2388] is a vice of nature, and the
   wretches who fall under its power call the disease a deity." For in
   these words it is shown that stupid people are overcome from ignorance
   of pleasure, to which we ought to give no admittance, even though it be
   called a god, that is, though it be given by God for the necessity of
   procreation. And Xenophon, expressly calling pleasure a vice, says:
   "Wretch, what good dost thou know, or what honourable aim hast thou?
   which does not even wait for the appetite for sweet things, eating
   before being hungry, drinking before being thirsty; and that thou
   mayest eat pleasantly, seeking out fine cooks; and that thou mayest
   drink pleasantly, procuring costly wines; and in summer runnest about
   seeking snow; and that thou mayest sleep pleasantly, not only providest
   soft beds, but also supports [2389] to the couches." Whence, as Aristo
   said, "against the whole tetrachord of pleasure, pain, fear, and lust,
   there is need of much exercise and struggle."


   "For it is these, it is these that go through our bowels,

   And throw into disorder men's hearts."

   "For the minds of those even who are deemed grave, pleasure makes
   waxen," according to Plato; since "each pleasure and pain nails to the
   body the soul" of the man, that does not sever and crucify himself from
   the passions. "He that loses his life," says the Lord, "shall save it;"
   either giving it up by exposing it to danger for the Lord's sake, as He
   did for us, or loosing it from fellowship with its habitual life. For
   if you would loose, and withdraw, and separate (for this is what the
   cross means) your soul from the delight and pleasure that is in this
   life, you will possess it, found and resting in the looked-for hope.
   And this would be the exercise of death, if we would be content with
   those desires which are measured according to nature alone, which do
   not pass the limit of those which are in accordance with nature--by
   going to excess, or going against nature--in which the possibility of
   sinning arises. "We must therefore put on the panoply of God, that we
   may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil; since the weapons
   of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling
   down of strongholds, casting down reasonings, and every lofty thing
   which exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing every
   thought into captivity unto the obedience of Christ," [2390] says the
   divine apostle. There is need of a man who shall use in a praiseworthy
   and discriminating manner the things from which passions take their
   rise, as riches and poverty, honour and dishonour, health and sickness,
   life and death, toil and pleasure. For, in order that we may treat
   things, that are different, indifferently, there is need of a great
   difference in us, as having been previously afflicted with much
   feebleness, and in the distortion of a bad training and nurture
   ignorantly indulged ourselves. The simple word, then, of our philosophy
   declares the passions to be impressions on the soul that is soft and
   yielding, and, as it were, the signatures of the spiritual powers with
   whom we have to struggle. For it is the business, in my opinion, of the
   malificent powers to endeavour to produce somewhat of their own
   constitution in everything, so as to overcome and make their own those
   who have renounced them. And it follows, as might be expected, that
   some are worsted; but in the case of those who engage in the contest
   with more athletic energy, the powers mentioned above, after carrying
   on the conflict in all forms, and advancing even as far as the crown
   wading in gore, decline the battle, and admire the victors.

   For of objects that are moved, some are moved by impulse and
   appearance, as animals; and some by transposition, as inanimate
   objects. And of things without life, plants, they say, are moved by
   transposition in order to growth, if we will concede to them that
   plants are without life. To stones, then, belongs a permanent state.
   Plants have a nature; and the irrational animals possess impulse and
   perception, and likewise the two characteristics already specified.
   [2391] But the reasoning faculty, being peculiar to the human soul,
   ought not to be impelled similarly with the irrational animals, but
   ought to discriminate appearances, and not to be carried away by them.
   The powers, then, of which we have spoken hold out beautiful sights,
   and honours, and adulteries, and pleasures, and such like alluring
   phantasies before facile spirits; [2392] as those who drive away cattle
   hold out branches to them. Then, having beguiled those incapable of
   distinguishing the true from the false pleasure, and the fading and
   meretricious from the holy beauty, they lead them into slavery. And
   each deceit, by pressing constantly on the spirit, impresses its image
   on it; and the soul unwittingly carries about the image of the passion,
   which takes its rise from the bait and our consent.

   The adherents of Basilides are in the habit of calling the passions
   appendages: saying that these are in essence certain spirits attached
   to the rational soul, through some original perturbation and confusion;
   and that, again, other bastard and heterogeneous natures of spirits
   grow on to them, like that of the wolf, the ape, the lion, the goat,
   whose properties showing themselves around the soul, they say,
   assimilate the lusts of the soul to the likeness of the animals. For
   they imitate the actions of those whose properties they bear. And not
   only are they associated with the impulses and perceptions of the
   irrational animals, but they affect [2393] the motions and the beauties
   of plants, on account of their bearing also the properties of plants
   attached to them. They have also the properties of a particular state,
   as the hardness of steel. But against this dogma we shall argue
   subsequently, when we treat of the soul. At present this only needs to
   be pointed out, that man, according to Basilides, preserves the
   appearance of a wooden horse, according to the poetic myth, embracing
   as he does in one body a host of such different spirits. Accordingly,
   Basilides' son himself, Isidorus, in his book, About the Soul attached
   to us, while agreeing in the dogma, as if condemning himself, writes in
   these words: "For if I persuade any one that the soul is undivided, and
   that the passions of the wicked are occasioned by the violence of the
   appendages, the worthless among men will have no slight pretence for
   saying, I was compelled, I was carried away, I did it against my will,
   I acted unwillingly;' though he himself led the desire of evil things,
   and did not fight against the assaults of the appendages. But we must,
   by acquiring superiority in the rational part, show ourselves masters
   of the inferior creation in us." For he too lays down the hypothesis of
   two souls in us, like the Pythagoreans, at whom we shall glance
   afterwards.

   Valentinus too, in a letter to certain people, writes in these very
   words respecting the appendages: "There is one good, by whose presence
   [2394] is the manifestation, which is by the Son, and by Him alone can
   the heart become pure, by the expulsion of every evil spirit from the
   heart: for the multitude of spirits dwelling in it do not suffer it to
   be pure; but each of them performs his own deeds, insulting it oft with
   unseemly lusts. And the heart seems to be treated somewhat like a
   caravanserai. For the latter has holes and ruts made in it, and is
   often filled with dung; men living filthily in it, and taking no care
   for the place as belonging to others. So fares it with the heart as
   long as there is no thought taken for it, being unclean, and the abode
   of many demons. But when the only good Father visits it, it is
   sanctified, and gleams with light. And he who possesses such a heart is
   so blessed, that "he shall see God." [2395]

   What, then, let them tell us, is the cause of such a soul not being
   cared for from the beginning? Either that it is not worthy (and somehow
   a care for it comes to it as from repentance), or it is a saved nature,
   as he would have it; and this, of necessity, from the beginning, being
   cared for by reason of its affinity, afforded no entrance to the impure
   spirits, unless by being forced and found feeble. For were he to grant
   that on repentance it preferred what was better, he will say this
   unwillingly, being what the truth we hold teaches; namely, that
   salvation is from a change due to obedience, but not from nature. For
   as the exhalations which arise from the earth, and from marshes, gather
   into mists and cloudy masses; so the vapours of fleshly lusts bring on
   the soul an evil condition, scattering about the idols of pleasure
   before the soul. Accordingly they spread darkness over the light of
   intelligence, the spirit attracting the exhalations that arise from
   lust, and thickening the masses of the passions by persistency in
   pleasures. Gold is not taken from the earth in the lump, but is
   purified by smelting; then, when made pure, it is called gold, the
   earth being purified. For "Ask, and it shall be given you," [2396] it
   is said to those who are able of themselves to choose what is best. And
   how we say that the powers of the devil, and the unclean spirits, sow
   into the sinner's soul, requires no more words from me, on adducing as
   a witness the apostolic Barnabas (and he was one of the seventy, [2397]
   and a fellow-worker of Paul), who speaks in these words: "Before we
   believed in God, the dwelling-place of our heart was unstable, truly a
   temple built with hands. For it was full of idolatry, and was a house
   of demons, through doing what was opposed to God." [2398]

   He says, then, that sinners exercise activities appropriate to demons;
   but he does not say that the spirits themselves dwell in the soul of
   the unbeliever. Wherefore he also adds, "See that the temple of the
   Lord be gloriously built. Learn, having received remission of sins; and
   having set our hope on the Name, let us become new, created again from
   the beginning." For what he says is not that demons are driven out of
   us, but that the sins which like them we commit before believing are
   remitted. Rightly thus he puts in opposition what follows: "Wherefore
   God truly dwells in our home. He dwells in us. How? The word of His
   faith, the calling of His promise, the wisdom of His statutes, the
   commandments of His communication, [dwell in us]."

   "I know that I have come upon a heresy; and its chief was wont to say
   that he fought with pleasure by pleasure, this worthy Gnostic advancing
   on pleasure in feigned combat, for he said he was a Gnostic; since he
   said it was no great thing for a man that had not tried pleasure to
   abstain from it, but for one who had mixed in it not to be overcome
   [was something]; and that therefore by means of it he trained himself
   in it. The wretched man knew not that he was deceiving himself by the
   artfulness of voluptuousness. To this opinion, then, manifestly
   Aristippus the Cyrenian adhered--that of the sophist who boasted of the
   truth. Accordingly, when reproached for continually cohabiting with the
   Corinthian courtezan, he said, "I possess Lais, and am not possessed by
   her."

   Such also are those (who say that they follow Nicolaus, quoting an
   adage of the man, which they pervert, [2399] "that the flesh must be
   abused." But the worthy man showed that it was necessary to check
   pleasures and lusts, and by such training to waste away the impulses
   and propensities of the flesh. But they, abandoning themselves to
   pleasure like goats, as if insulting the body, lead a life of
   self-indulgence; not knowing that the body is wasted, being by nature
   subject to dissolution; while their soul is buried in the mire of vice;
   following as they do the teaching of pleasure itself, not of the
   apostolic man. For in what do they differ from Sardanapalus, whose life
   is shown in the epigram:--


   "I have what I ate--what I enjoyed wantonly;

   And the pleasures I felt in love. But those

   Many objects of happiness are left,

   For I too am dust, who ruled great Ninus."

   For the feeling of pleasure is not at all a necessity, but the
   accompaniment of certain natural needs--hunger, thirst, cold, marriage.
   If, then, it were possible to drink without it, or take food, or beget
   children, no other need of it could be shown. For pleasure is neither a
   function, nor a state, nor any part of us; but has been introduced into
   life as an auxiliary, as they say salt was to season food. But when it
   casts off restraint and rules the house, it generates first
   concupiscence, which is an irrational propension and impulse towards
   that which gratifies it; and it induced Epicurus to lay down pleasure
   as the aim of the philosopher. Accordingly he deifies a sound condition
   of body, and the certain hope respecting it. For what else is luxury
   than the voluptuous gluttony and the superfluous abundance of those who
   are abandoned to self-indulgence? Diogenes writes significantly in a
   tragedy:--


   "Who to the pleasures of effeminate

   And filthy luxury attached in heart,

   Wish not to undergo the slightest toil."

   And what follows, expressed indeed in foul language, but in a manner
   worthy of the voluptuaries.

   Wherefore the divine law appears to me necessarily to menace with fear,
   that, by caution and attention, the philosopher may acquire and retain
   absence of anxiety, continuing without fall and without sin in all
   things. For peace and freedom are not otherwise won, than by ceaseless
   and unyielding struggles with our lusts. For these stout and Olympic
   antagonists are keener than wasps, so to speak; and Pleasure
   especially, not by day only, but by night, is in dreams with witchcraft
   ensnaringly plotting and biting. How, then, can the Greeks any more be
   right in running down the law, when they themselves teach that Pleasure
   is the slave of fear? Socrates accordingly bids "people guard against
   enticements to eat when they are not hungry, and to drink when not
   thirsty, and the glances and kisses of the fair, as fitted to inject a
   deadlier poison than that of scorpions and spiders." And Antisthenes
   chose rather "to be demented than delighted." And the Theban Crates
   says:--


   "Master these, exulting in the disposition of the soul,

   Vanquished neither by gold nor by languishing love,

   Nor are they any longer attendants to the wanton."

   And at length infers:--


   "Those, unenslaved and unbended by servile Pleasure,

   Love the immortal kingdom and freedom."

   He writes expressly, in other words, "that the stop [2400] to the
   unbridled propensity to amorousness is hunger or a halter."

   And the comic poets attest, while they depreciate the teaching of Zeno
   the Stoic, to be to the following effect:--


   "For he philosophizes a vain philosophy:

   He teaches to want food, and gets pupils

   One loaf, and for seasoning a dry fig, and to drink water."

   All these, then, are not ashamed clearly to confess the advantage which
   accrues from caution. And the wisdom which is true and not contrary to
   reason, trusting not in mere words and oracular utterances, but in
   invulnerable armour of defence and energetic mysteries, and devoting
   itself to divine commands, and exercise, and practice, receives a
   divine power according to its inspiration from the Word.

   Already, then, the ægis of the poetic Jove is described as


   "Dreadful, crowned all around by Terror,

   And on it Strife and Prowess, and chilling Rout;

   On it, too, the Gorgon's head, dread monster,

   Terrible, dire, the sign of Ægis-bearing Jove." [2401]

   But to those, who are able rightly to understand salvation, I know not
   what will appear dearer than the gravity of the Law, and Reverence,
   which is its daughter. For when one is said to pitch too high, as also
   the Lord says, with reference to certain; so that some of those whose
   desires are towards Him may not sing out of pitch and tune, I do not
   understand it as pitching too high in reality, but only as spoken with
   reference to such as will not take up the divine yoke. For to those,
   who are unstrung and feeble, what is medium seems too high; and to
   those, who are unrighteous, what befalls them seems severe justice. For
   those, who, on account of the favour they entertain for sins, are prone
   to pardon, suppose truth to be harshness, and severity to be
   savageness, and him who does not sin with them, and is not dragged with
   them, to be pitiless. Tragedy writes therefore well of Pluto:--


   "And to what sort of a deity wilt thou come, [2402] dost thou ask,

   Who knows neither clemency nor favour,

   But loves bare justice alone."

   For although you are not yet able to do the things enjoined by the Law,
   yet, considering that the noblest examples are set before us in it, we
   are able to nourish and increase the love of liberty; and so we shall
   profit more eagerly as far as we can, inviting some things, imitating
   some things, and fearing others. For thus the righteous of the olden
   time, who lived according to the law, "were not from a storied oak, or
   from a rock;" because they wish to philosophize truly, took and devoted
   themselves entirely to God, and were classified under faith. Zeno said
   well of the Indians, that he would rather have seen one Indian roasted,
   than have learned the whole of the arguments about bearing pain. But we
   have exhibited before our eyes every day abundant sources of martyrs
   that are burnt, impaled, beheaded. All these the fear inspired by the
   law,--leading as a pædagogue to Christ, trained so as to manifest their
   piety by their blood. "God stood in the congregation of the gods; He
   judgeth in the midst of the gods." [2403] Who are they? Those that are
   superior to Pleasure, who rise above the passions, who know what they
   do--the Gnostics, who are greater than the world. "I said, Ye are Gods;
   and all sons of the Highest." [2404] To whom speaks the Lord? To those
   who reject as far as possible all that is of man. And the apostle says,
   "For ye are not any longer in the flesh, but in the Spirit." [2405] And
   again he says, "Though in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh."
   [2406] "For flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither
   doth corruption inherit incorruption." [2407] "Lo, ye shall die like
   men," the Spirit has said, confuting us.

   We must then exercise ourselves in taking care about those things which
   fall under the power of the passions, fleeing like those who are truly
   philosophers such articles of food as excite lust, and dissolute
   licentiousness in chambering and luxury; and the sensations that tend
   to luxury, which are a solid reward to others, must no longer be so to
   us. For God's greatest gift is self-restraint. For He Himself has said,
   "I will neyer leave thee, nor forsake thee," [2408] as having judged
   thee worthy according to the true election. Thus, then, while we
   attempt piously to advance, we shall have put on us the mild yoke of
   the Lord from faith to faith, one charioteer driving each of us onward
   to salvation, that the meet fruit of beatitude may be won. "Exercise
   is" according to Hippocrates of Cos, "not only the health of the body,
   but of the soul--fearlessness of labours--a ravenous appetite for
   food."

      Chapter XXI.--Opinions of Various Philosophers on the Chief Good.

   Epicurus, in placing happiness in not being hungry, or thirsty, or
   cold, uttered that godlike word, saying impiously that he would fight
   in these points even with Father Jove; teaching, as if it were the case
   of pigs that live in filth and not that of rational philosophers, that
   happiness was victory. For of those that are ruled by pleasure are the
   Cyrenaics and Epicurus; for these expressly said that to live
   pleasantly was the chief end, and that pleasure was the only perfect
   good. Epicurus also says that the removal of pain is pleasure; and says
   that that is to be preferred, which first attracts from itself to
   itself, being, that is, wholly in motion. Dinomachus and Callipho said
   that the chief end was for one to do what he could for the attainment
   and enjoyment of pleasure; and Hieronymus the Peripatetic said the
   great end was to live unmolested, and that the only final good was
   happiness; and Diodorus likewise, who belonged to the same sect,
   pronounces the end to be to live undisturbed and well. Epicurus indeed,
   and the Cyrenaics, say that pleasure is the first duty; for it is for
   the sake of pleasure, they say, that virtue was introduced, and
   produced pleasure. According to the followers of Calliphon, virtue was
   introduced for the sake of pleasure, but that subsequently, on seeing
   its own beauty, it made itself equally prized with the first principle,
   that is, pleasure.

   But the Aristotelians lay it down, that to live in accordance with
   virtue is the end, but that neither happiness nor the end is reached by
   every one who has virtue. For the wise man, vexed and involved in
   involuntary mischances, and wishing gladly on these accounts to flee
   from life, is neither fortunate nor happy. For virtue needs time; for
   that is not acquired in one day which exists [only] in the perfect man
   since, as they say, a child is never happy. But human life is a perfect
   time, and therefore happiness is completed by the three kinds of good
   things. Neither, then, the poor, nor the mean nor even the diseased,
   nor the slave, can be one of them.

   Again, on the other hand, Zeno the Stoic thinks the end to be living
   according to virtue; and, Cleanthes, living agreeably to nature in the
   right exercise of reason, which he held to consist of the selection of
   things according to nature. And Antipatrus, his friend, supposes the
   end to consist in choosing continually and unswervingly the things
   which are according to nature, and rejecting those contrary to nature.
   Archedamus, on the other hand, explained the end to be such, that in
   selecting the greatest and chief things according to nature, it was
   impossible to overstep it. In addition to these, Panætius pronounced
   the end to be, to live according to the means given to us by nature.
   And finally, Posidonius said that it was to live engaged in
   contemplating the truth and order of the universe, and forming himself
   as he best can, in nothing influenced by the irrational part of his
   soul. And some of the later Stoics defined the great end to consist in
   living agreeably to the constitution of man. Why should I mention
   Aristo? He said that the end was indifference; but what is indifferent
   simply abandons the indifferent. Shall I bring forward the opinions of
   Herillus? Herillus states the end to be to live according to science.
   For some think that the more recent disciples of the Academy define the
   end to be, the steady abstraction of the mind to its own impressions.
   Further, Lycus the Peripatetic used to say that the final end was the
   true joy of the soul; as Leucimus, that it was the joy it had in what
   was good. Critolaus, also a Peripatetic, said that it was the
   perfection of a life flowing rightly according to nature, referring to
   the perfection accomplished by the three kinds according to tradition.

   We must, however, not rest satisfied with these, but endeavour as we
   best can to adduce the doctrines laid down on the point by the
   naturalist; for they say that Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ affirmed
   contemplation and the freedom flowing from it to be the end of life;
   Heraclitus the Ephesian, complacency. The Pontic Heraclides relates,
   that Pythagoras taught that the knowledge of the perfection of the
   numbers [2409] was happiness of the soul. The Abderites also teach the
   existence of an end. Democritus, in his work On the Chief End, said it
   was cheerfulness, which he also called well-being, and often exclaims,
   "For delight and its absence are the boundary of those who have reached
   full age;" Hecatæus, that it was sufficiency to one's self; Apollodotus
   of Cyzicum, that it was delectation; as Nausiphanes, that it was
   undauntedness, [2410] for he said that it was this that was called by
   Democritus imperturbability. In addition to these still, Diotimus
   declared the end to be perfection of what is good, which he said was
   termed well-being. Again, Antisthenes, that it was humility. And those
   called Annicereans, of the Cyrenaic succession, laid down no definite
   end for the whole of life; but said that to each action belonged, as
   its proper end, the pleasure accruing from the action. These Cyrenaics
   reject Epicurus' definition of pleasure, that is the removal of pain,
   calling that the condition of a dead man; because we rejoice not only
   on account of pleasures, but companionships and distinctions; while
   Epicurus thinks that all joy of the soul arises from previous
   sensations of the flesh. Metrodorus, in his book On the Source of
   Happiness in Ourselves being greater than that which arises from
   Objects, says: What else is the good of the soul but the sound state of
   the flesh, and the sure hope of its continuance?

      Chapter XXII.--Plato's Opinion, that the Chief Good Consists in
      Assimilation to God, and Its Agreement with Scripture.

   Further, Plato the philosopher says that the end is twofold: that which
   is communicable, and exists first in the ideal forms themselves, which
   he also calls "the good;" and that which partakes of it, and receives
   its likeness from it, as is the case in the men who appropriate virtue
   and true philosophy. Wherefore also Cleanthes, in the second book, On
   Pleasure, says that Socrates everywhere teaches that the just man and
   the happy are one and the same, and execrated the first man who
   separated the just from the useful, as having done an impious thing.
   For those are in truth impious who separate the useful from that which
   is right according to the law. Plato himself says that happiness
   (eudaimonia) is to possess rightly the dæmon, and that the ruling
   faculty of the soul is called the dæmon; and he terms happiness
   (eudaimonia) the most perfect and complete good. Sometimes he calls it
   a consistent and harmonious life, sometimes the highest perfection in
   accordance with virtue; and this he places in the knowledge of the
   Good, and in likeness to God, demonstrating likeness to be justice and
   holiness with wisdom. For is it not thus that some of our writers have
   understood that man straightway on his creation received what is
   "according to the image," but that what is according "to the likeness"
   he will receive afterwards on his perfection? Now Plato, teaching that
   the virtuous man shall have this likeness accompanied with humility,
   explains the following: "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
   [2411] He says, accordingly, in The Laws: "God indeed, as the ancient
   saying has it, occupying the beginning, the middle, and the end of all
   things, goes straight through while He goes round the circumference.
   And He is always attended by Justice, the avenger of those who revolt
   from the divine law." You see how he connects fear with the divine law.
   He adds, therefore: "To which he, who would be happy, cleaving, will
   follow lowly and beautified." Then, connecting what follows these
   words, and admonishing by fear, he adds: "What conduct, then, is dear
   and conformable to God? That which is characterized by one word of old
   date: Like will be dear to like, as to what is in proportion; but
   things out of proportion are neither dear to one another, nor to those
   which are in proportion. And that therefore he that would be dear to
   God, must, to the best of his power, become such as He is. And in
   virtue of the same reason, our self-controlling man is dear to God. But
   he that has no self-control is unlike and diverse." In saying that it
   was an ancient dogma, he indicates the teaching which had come to him
   from the law. And having in the Theatoetus admitted that evils make the
   circuit of mortal nature and of this spot, he adds: "Wherefore we must
   try to flee hence as soon as possible. For flight is likeness to God as
   far as possible. And likeness is to become holy and just with wisdom."
   Speusippus, the nephew of Plato, says that happiness is a perfect state
   in those who conduct themselves in accordance with nature, or the state
   of the good: for which condition all men have a desire, but the good
   only attained to quietude; consequently the virtues are the authors of
   happiness. And Xenocrates the Chalcedonian defines happiness to be the
   possession of virtue, strictly so called, and of the power subservient
   to it. Then he clearly says, that the seat in which it resides is the
   soul; that by which it is effected, the virtues; and that of these as
   parts are formed praiseworthy actions, good habits and dispositions,
   and motions, and relations; and that corporeal and external objects are
   not without these. For Polemo, the disciple of Xenocrates, seems of the
   opinion that happiness is sufficiency of all good things, or of the
   most and greatest. He lays down the doctrine, then, that happiness
   never exists without virtue; and that virtue, apart from corporeal and
   external objects, is sufficient for happiness. Let these things be so.
   The contradictions to the opinions specified shall be adduced in due
   time. But on us it is incumbent to reach the unaccomplished end,
   obeying the commands--that is, God--and living according to them,
   irreproachably and intelligently, through knowledge of the divine will;
   and assimilation as far as possible in accordance with right reason is
   the end, and restoration to perfect adoption by the Son, which ever
   glorifies the Father by the great High Priest who has deigned to call
   us brethren and fellow-heirs. And the apostle, succinctly describing
   the end, writes in the Epistle to the Romans: "But now, being made free
   from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness,
   and the end everlasting life." [2412] And viewing the hope as
   twofold--that which is expected, and that which has been received--he
   now teaches the end to be the restitution of the hope. "For patience,"
   he says, "worketh experience, and experience hope: and hope maketh not
   ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
   Holy Spirit that is given to us." [2413] On account of which love and
   the restoration to hope, he says, in another place, "which rest is laid
   up for us." [2414] You will find in Ezekiel the like, as follows: "The
   soul that sinneth, it shall die. And the man who shall be righteous,
   and shall do judgment and justice, who has not eaten on the mountains,
   nor lifted his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not
   defiled his neighbour's wife, and hath not approached to a woman in the
   time of her uncleanness (for he does not wish the seed of man to be
   dishonoured), and will not injure a man; will restore the debtor's
   pledge, and will not take usury; will turn away his hand from wrong;
   will do true judgment between a man and his neighbour; will walk in my
   ordinances, and keep my commandments, so as to do the truth; he is
   righteous, he shall surely live, saith Adonai the Lord." [2415] Isaiah
   too, in exhorting him that hath not believed to gravity of life, and
   the Gnostic to attention, proving that man's virtue and God's are not
   the same, speaks thus: "Seek the Lord, and on finding Him call on Him.
   And when He shall draw near to you, let the wicked forsake his ways,
   and the unrighteous man his ways; and let him return to the Lord, and
   he shall obtain mercy," down to "and your thoughts from my thoughts."
   [2416] "We," then, according to the noble apostle, "wait for the hope
   of righteousness by faith. For in Christ neither circumcision availeth
   anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love." [2417]
   And we desire that every one of you show the same diligence to the full
   assurance of hope," down to "made an high priest for ever, after the
   order of Melchizedek." [2418] Similarly with Paul "the All-virtuous
   Wisdom" says, "He that heareth me shall dwell trusting in hope." [2419]
   For the restoration of hope is called by the same term "hope." To the
   expression "will dwell" it has most beautifully added "trusting,"
   showing that such an one has obtained rest, having received the hope
   for which he hoped. Wherefore also it is added, "and shall be quiet,
   without fear of any evil." And openly and expressly the apostle, in the
   first Epistle to the Corinthians says, "Be ye followers of me, as also
   I am of Christ," [2420] in order that that may take place. If ye are of
   me, and I am of Christ, then ye are imitators of Christ, and Christ of
   God. Assimilation to God, then, so that as far as possible a man
   becomes righteous and holy with wisdom he lays down as the aim of
   faith, and the end to be that restitution of the promise which is
   effected by faith. From these doctrines gush the fountains, which we
   specified above, of those who have dogmatized about "the end." But of
   these enough.

      Chapter XXIII.--On Marriage.

   Since pleasure and lust seem to fall under marriage, it must also be
   treated of. Marriage is the first conjunction of man and woman for the
   procreation of legitimate children. [2421] Accordingly Menander the
   comic poet says:--


   "For the begetting of legitimate children,

   I give thee my daughter."

   We ask if we ought to marry; which is one of the points, which are said
   to be relative. For some must marry, and a man must be in some
   condition, and he must marry some one in some condition. For every one
   is not to marry, nor always. But there is a time in which it is
   suitable, and a person for whom it is suitable, and an age up to which
   it is suitable. Neither ought every one to take a wife, nor is it every
   woman one is to take, nor always, nor in every way, nor
   inconsiderately. But only he who is in certain circumstances, and such
   an one and at such time as is requisite, and for the sake of children,
   and one who is in every respect similar, and who does not by force or
   compulsion love the husband who loves her. Hence Abraham, regarding his
   wife as a sister, says, "She is my sister by my father, but not by my
   mother; and she became my wife," [2422] teaching us that children of
   the same mothers ought not to enter into matrimony. Let us briefly
   follow the history. Plato ranks marriage among outward good things,
   providing for the perpetuity of our race, and handing down as a torch a
   certain perpetuity to children's children. Democritus repudiates
   marriage and the procreation of children, on account of the many
   annoyances thence arising, and abstractions from more necessary things.
   Epicurus agrees, and those who place good in pleasure, and in the
   absence of trouble and pain. According to the opinion of the Stoics,
   marriage and the rearing of children are a thing indifferent; and
   according to the Peripatetics, a good. In a word, these, following out
   their dogmas in words, became enslaved to pleasures; some using
   concubines, some mistresses, and the most youths. And that wise
   quaternion in the garden with a mistress, honoured pleasure by their
   acts. Those, then, will not escape the curse of yoking an ass with an
   ox, who, judging certain things not to suit them, command others to do
   them, or the reverse. This Scripture has briefly showed, when it says,
   "What thou hatest, thou shalt not do to another." [2423]

   But they who approve of marriage say, Nature has adapted us for
   marriage, as is evident from the structure of our bodies, which are
   male and female. And they constantly proclaim that command, "Increase
   and replenish." [2424] And though this is the case, yet it seems to
   them shameful that man, created by God, should be more licentious than
   the irrational creatures, which do not mix with many licentiously, but
   with one of the same species, such as pigeons and ringdoves, [2425] and
   creatures like them. Furthermore, they say, "The childless man fails in
   the perfection which is according to nature, not having substituted his
   proper successor in his place. For he is perfect that has produced from
   himself his like, or rather, when he sees that he has produced the
   same; that is, when that which is begotten attains to the same nature
   with him who begat." Therefore we must by all means marry, both for our
   country's sake, for the succession of children, and as far as we are
   concerned, the perfection of the world; since the poets also pity a
   marriage half-perfect and childless, but pronounce the fruitful one
   happy. But it is the diseases of the body that principally show
   marriage to be necessary. For a wife's care and the assiduity of her
   constancy appear to exceed the endurance of all other relations and
   friends, as much as to excel them in sympathy; and most of all, she
   takes kindly to patient watching. And in truth, according to Scripture,
   she is a needful help. [2426] The comic poet then, Menander, while
   running down marriage, and yet alleging on the other side its
   advantages, replies to one who had said:--


   "I am averse to the thing,

   For you take it awkwardly."

   Then he adds:--


   "You see the hardships and the things which annoy you in it.

   But you do not look on the advantages."

   And so forth.

   Now marriage is a help in the case of those advanced in years, by
   furnishing a spouse to take care of one, and by rearing children of her
   to nourish one's old age.


   "For to a man after death his children bring renown,

   Just as corks bear the net,

   Saving the fishing-line from the deep." [2427]

   according to the tragic poet Sophocles.

   Legislators, moreover, do not allow those who are unmarried to
   discharge the highest magisterial offices. For instance, the legislator
   of the Spartans imposed a fine not on bachelorhood only, but on
   monogamy, [2428] and late marriage, and single life. And the renowned
   Plato orders the man who has not married to pay a wife's maintenance
   into the public treasury, and to give to the magistrates a suitable sum
   of money as expenses. For if they shall not beget children, not having
   married, they produce, as far as in them lies, a scarcity of men, and
   dissolve states and the world that is composed of them, impiously doing
   away with divine generation. It is also unmanly and weak to shun living
   with a wife and children. For of that of which the loss is an evil, the
   possession is by all means a good; and this is the case with the rest
   of things. But the loss of children is, they say, among the chiefest
   evils: the possession of children is consequently a good thing; and if
   it be so, so also is marriage. It is said:--


   "Without a father there never could be a child,

   And without a mother conception of a child could not be.

   Marriage makes a father, as a husband a mother." [2429]

   Accordingly Homer makes a thing to be earnestly prayed for:--


   "A husband and a house;"

   yet not simply, but along with good agreement. For the marriage of
   other people is an agreement for indulgence; but that of philosophers
   leads to that agreement which is in accordance with reason, bidding
   wives adorn themselves not in outward appearance, but in character; and
   enjoining husbands not to treat their wedded wives as mistresses,
   making corporeal wantonness their aim; but to take advantage of
   marriage for help in the whole of life, and for the best
   self-restraint.

   Far more excellent, in my opinion, than the seeds of wheat and barley
   that are sown at appropriate seasons, is man that is sown, for whom all
   things grow; and those seeds temperate husbandmen ever sow. Every foul
   and polluting practice must therefore be purged away from marriage;
   that the intercourse of the irrational animals may not be cast in our
   teeth, as more accordant with nature than human conjunction in
   procreation. Some of these, it must be granted, desist at the time in
   which they are directed, leaving creation to the working of Providence.

   By the tragedians, Polyxena, though being murdered, is described
   nevertheless as having, when dying, taken great care to fall
   decently,--


   "Concealing what ought to be hid from the eyes of men."

   Marriage to her was a calamity. To be subjected, then, to the passions,
   and to yield to them, is the extremest slavery; as to keep them in
   subjection is the only liberty. The divine Scripture accordingly says,
   that those who have transgressed the commandments are sold to
   strangers, that is, to sins alien to nature, till they return and
   repent. Marriage, then, as a sacred image, must be kept pure from those
   things which defile it. [2430] We are to rise from our slumbers with
   the Lord, and retire to sleep with thanksgiving and prayer,--


   "Both when you sleep, and when the holy light comes,"

   confessing the Lord in our whole life; possessing piety in the soul,
   and extending self-control to the body. For it is pleasing to God to
   lead decorum from the tongue to our actions. Filthy speech is the way
   to effrontery; and the end of both is filthy conduct.

   Now that the Scripture counsels marriage, and allows no release from
   the union, is expressly contained in the law, "Thou shalt not put away
   thy wife, except for the cause of fornication;" and it regards as
   fornication, the marriage of those separated while the other is alive.
   Not to deck and adorn herself beyond what is becoming, renders a wife
   free of calumnious suspicion, while she devotes herself assiduously to
   prayers and supplications; avoiding frequent departures from the house,
   and shutting herself up as far as possible from the view of all not
   related to her, and deeming housekeeping of more consequence than
   impertinent trifling. "He that taketh a woman that has been put away,"
   it is said, "committeth adultery; and if one puts away his wife, he
   makes her an adulteress," [2431] that is, compels her to commit
   adultery. And not only is he who puts her away guilty of this, but he
   who takes her, by giving to the woman the opportunity of sinning; for
   did he not take her, she would return to her husband. What, then, is
   the law? [2432] In order to check the impetuosity of the passions, it
   commands the adulteress to be put to death, on being convicted of this;
   and if of priestly family, to be committed to the flames. [2433] And
   the adulterer also is stoned to death, but not in the same place, that
   not even their death may be in common. And the law is not at variance
   with the Gospel, but agrees with it. How should it be otherwise, one
   Lord being the author of both? She who has committed fornication liveth
   in sin, and is dead to the commandments; but she who has repented,
   being as it were born again by the change in her life, has a
   regeneration of life; the old harlot being dead, and she who has been
   regenerated by repentance having come back again to life. The Spirit
   testifies to what has been said by Ezekiel, declaring, "I desire not
   the death of the sinner, but that he should turn." [2434] Now they are
   stoned to death; as through hardness of heart dead to the law which
   they believed not. But in the case of a priestess the punishment is
   increased, because "to whom much is given, from him shall more be
   required." [2435]

   Let us conclude this second book of the Stromata at this point, on
   account of the length and number of the chapters.

  Elucidations.

      I.

   (On the Greeks, cap. i. [53]note 3, p. 347.)

   The admirable comments of Stier on the Greeks, who said to Philip, "We
   would see Jesus," [2436] seem to me vindicated by the history of the
   Gospel, and by the part which the Greeks were called to take in its
   propagation. Clement seems to me the man of Providence, who gives rich
   significance to "the corn of wheat," and its multiplication in Gentile
   discipleship. And in this I am a convert to Stier's view, against my
   preconceptions. That the Greeks who were at Jerusalem at the Passover
   were other than Hellenistic Jews, or Greek proselytes, always seemed to
   me improbable; but, more and more, I discover a design in this
   narrative, which seems to me thoroughly sustained by the history of the
   Gentile churches, which were Greek everywhere originally, and for the
   use of which the Septuagint had been prepared in the providence of God.
   To say nothing of the New-Testament Scriptures, the whole symbolic and
   liturgic system of the early Christians and all the Catholic councils
   which were Greek in their topography, language, and legislation,
   confirm the sublime thought which Stier has elucidated. "The Pharisees
   said, The world is gone after him; and there were certain Greeks," etc.
   So the story is introduced. Jesus is told of their desire to see him;
   and he answers, "The hour is come that the Son of man should be
   glorified;" and he goes on to speak of his death as giving life to the
   world. I feel grateful to Stier for his bold originality in treating
   the subject; and I trust others will find that it invests the study of
   the ante-Nicene Fathers with a fresh interest, and throws back from
   their writings a peculiar reflex light on the New-Testament Scriptures
   themselves.

      II.

   (See p. 352, note 9.)

   Monos ho sophos eleupheros. Stier, in his comments [2437] on St. John
   (viii. 32-36), may well be compared with this chapter of Clement's. The
   eighteenth chapter of this book must also be kept in view if we would
   do full justice to the true position of Clement, who recognises nothing
   in heathen philosophy as true wisdom, save as it flows from God, in
   Moses, and through the Hebrew Church. That Greek philosophy, so viewed,
   did lead to Christ, and that this great principle is recognised in the
   apostolic teachings, seems to me indisputable. This illustrates what
   has been noted above in [54]Elucidation I.

      III.

   (See p. 359.)

   Clement notes that the false Gnostics rejected the Epistles to Timothy,
   [2438] chiefly because of 1 Tim. vi. 20. Beausobre (Histoire du
   Manichéisme, tom. ii. p. v.) doubts as to Basilides, whether he is open
   to this charge; but Jerome accuses him expressly of rejecting the
   pastoral epistles, and that to the Hebrews. For this, and Neander's
   qualifying comment, see Kaye, p. 263. Clement is far from charging
   Basilides, personally, with an immoral life, or from lending his
   sanction to impurity; but a study of the Gnostic sects, with whom our
   Alexandrian doctor was forced to contend, will show that they were
   introducing, under the pretence of Christianity, such abominations as
   made their defeat and absolute overthrow a matter of life and death for
   the Church. To let such teachers be confounded with Christians, was to
   neutralize the very purpose for which the Church existed. Now, it was
   in the deadly grapple with such loathsome errorists, that the idea of
   "Catholic orthodoxy" became so precious to the primitive faithful. They
   were forced to make even the heathen comprehend the existence of that
   word-wide confederation of churches already explained, [2439] and to
   exhibit their Scriptural creed and purity of discipline, in the
   strongest contrast with these pestilent "armies of the aliens," who
   were neither Gnostics nor Christians indeed, much less Catholic or
   Orthodox teachers and believers.

   Now, if in dealing with counterfeits Clement was obliged to meet them
   on their own grounds, and defeat them on a plan, at once intelligible
   to the heathen, and enabling all believers to "fight the good fight of
   faith" successfully, we must concede that he knew better than we can,
   what was suited to the Alexandrian schools, their intellect, and their
   false mysticism. His works were a great safeguard to those who came
   after him; though they led to the false system of exposition by which
   Origen so greatly impaired his services to the Church, and perhaps to
   other evils, which, in the issue, shook the great patriarchate of
   Alexandria to its foundations. It is curious to trace the influence of
   Clement, through Tertullian and St. Augustine, upon the systems of the
   schoolmen, and again, through them, on the Teutonic reformers. The
   mysticism of Fénelon as well, may be traced, more than is generally
   credited, to the old Alexandrian school, which was itself the product
   of some of the most subtle elements of our nature, sanctified, but not
   wholly controlled, by the wisdom that is from above. Compare the
   interminable controversies of the period, in the writings of Fénelon
   and Bossuet; and, for a succinct history, see L'Histoire de l'église de
   France, par l'Abbe Guettée, tom. xi. p. 156 et seqq.

      Caput I.--Basilidis Sententiam de Continentia Et Nuptiis Refutat.

   Ac Valentiniani quidem, qui desuper ex divinis emissionibus deduxere
   conjugationes, acceptum habent matrimonium: Basilidis autem sectatores,
   "Cum interrogassent, inquiunt, apostoli, nun sit melius uxorem non
   ducere, dicunt respondisse Dominum: Non omnes capiunt verbum hoc. Sunt
   enim eunuchi alii a nativitate, alii vero a necessitate.'" [2441] Hoc
   dictum autem sic interpretantur: "Quidam ex quo nati sunt, naturaliter
   feminam aversantur, qui quidem hoc naturali utentes temperamento, recte
   faciunt, si uxorem non ducant. Hi, inquiunt, eunuchi sunt ex
   nativitate. Qui autem sunt a necessitate, ii sunt theatrici
   exercitatores, qui, gloriæ studio retracti, se continent. Quinetiam qui
   casu aliquo excisi sunt, eunuchi facti sunt per necessitatem. Qui
   itaque eunuchi fiunt per necessitatem, non fiunt eunuchi secundum
   logon, seu rationem. Qui autem regni sempiterni gratia seipsos
   castrarunt, id ad declinandas, inquiunt, conjugii molestias fecerunt,
   quod procurandæ rei familiaris onus ac sollicitudinem timerent. Et
   illud: Melius est nubere quam uri,' [2442] dicentem Apostolum aiunt
   velle: Ne animam tuam in ignem injicias, noctu et interdiu resistens,
   et timens ne a continentia excidas. Nam cum in resistendo occupata
   fuerit anima, a spe est divisa"--Patienter igitur sustine," inquit his
   verbis Isidoms in Moralibus, "contentiosam mulierem, ne a Dei gratia
   avellaris; et cum ignem in semine excreveris, cum bona ores
   conscientia. Quando autem, inquit, tua gratiarum actio delapsa fuerit
   in petitionem, et deinceps' steteris, ut tamen labi ac timbare non
   desinas, duc uxorem. Sin est aliquis juvenis, vel pauper, vel infirmus,
   et non ei libel logo, seu rationi, convenienter uxorem ducere, is a
   fratre ne discedat; dicat: Ingressus sum in sancta, nihil possum pati.
   Quod si eum suspicio aliqua subeat, dicat: Frater, impone mihi manure,
   ne peccem; et confestim turn in mente, turn in corpore opem experietur.
   Velit modo quod bonum est perficere, et assequetur. Nonnunquam autem
   ore tenus dicimus: Nolumus peccare; animus autem noster propendet in
   pectatum. Qui est ejusmodi, propier meturn, quod vult, non facit, ne ei
   constituatur supplicium. At hominum generi quædam necessaria sunt ac
   naturalia duntaxat. Quod indumentis egeat, necessarium simul est et
   naturale: est autem venerea voluptas naturalis, sed non necessaria."
   Has voces adduxi ad reprehendendos Basilidianos, qui non recte vivunt,
   ut qui vel peccandi potestatem habeant propier perfectionera, vel
   omnino quidera natura salvi futuri sint, etsi nunc peccent, quod naturæ
   dignitate sunt electi. Neque vero primi dogmaturn architecti eorumdem
   perpetrandorum potestatem illis faciunt. Ne ergo Christi nomen
   suspicientes, et iis, qui sunt in gentibus intemperantissimi,
   incontinentius viventes, nomini maledictum inurant. "Qui enim sunt
   ejusmodi, pseudapostoli, operarii dolosi," usque ad illud: "Quorum
   finis erit secundum opera eorum." [2443] Est ergo continentia, corporis
   despicientia secundum confessionem in Deum; non solum enim in rebus
   venereis, sed etiam in aliis, quæ anima perperam concupiscit, non
   contenta necessariis, versatur continentia. Est autem et in lingua, et
   in acquirendo, et in utendo, et in concupiscendo continentia. Non docet
   autem ea solummodo esse temperantes, siquidem præbet nobis
   temperantiam, ut quæ sit divina potestas et gratia. Dicendum est ergo,
   quidnam nostris videatur de eo, quod est propositum. Nos quidem
   castitatem, et eos, quibus hoc a Deo datum est, beatos decimus:
   monogamiam autem, et quæ consistit in uno solum matrimonio, honestatem
   admira tour; dicerites tamen oportere aliorum misereri, et "alterum
   alterius onera portare," [2444] ne "quis, cure" recte "stare videatur,"
   [2445] ipse quoque "cadat." De secundis autum nuptiis: "Si uraris,"
   inquit Apostolus, "jungere matrimonio." [2446]

      Caput II.--Carpocratis Et Epiphanis Sententiam de Feminarum Communitate
      Refutat.

   Qui autem a Carpocrate descendunt et Epiphane, censent oportere uxores
   esse communes; a quibus contra nomen Christi maximum emanavit probruin.
   Hic autem Epiphanes, cujus etiam scripta feruntur, filius erat
   Carpocratis, et matris Alexandriæ nomine, ex patre quidera
   Alexandrinus, ex matre vero Cephalleneus. Vixit autem solum septemdecim
   annos, et Same, quæ est urbs Cephalleniæ, ut deus est honore affectus.
   Quo in loco templum ex ingentibus lapidibus, altaria, delubra, museum,
   ædificatum est et consecratum; et cure est nova luna, convenientes
   Cephallenei, diem natalem, quo in deos relatus est Epiphanes,
   sacrificant, libantque, et convivantur, et hymnos canunt. A patre autem
   didicit et orbem disciplinarum et Platonis philosophiam. Fuit autem
   princeps monadicæ [2447] cognitionis. A quo etiam profluxit hæresis
   eorum, qui nunc sunt, Carpocratianorum. Is ergo dicit in libro De
   justitia, "Justitiam Dei esse quamdam cure æqualitate communionem.
   Æquale quidera certe coelum undequaque extensum totam terrain cingit.
   Et nox ex æquo stellas omnes ostendit; et diei auctorem et lucis
   patrem, solem, Deus ex alto æqualem effudit omnibus, qui possunt videre
   (illi autem omnes communiter respiciunt), quoniam non discernit divitem
   vel pauperem vel populi principem, insipientes et sapientes, femmas et
   masculos, liberos, servos. Sed neque secus facit in brutis. Cure autem
   omnibus animantibus æque ipsum communem effuderit. bonis et malis
   justitiam suam confirmat, cure nemo possit plus habere, neque auferre a
   proximo, ut ipse illius lucem habeat duplicatam. Sol facit omnibus
   animantibus communia exorm nutrimenta, communi justitia ex æquo data
   omnibus: et ad ea, quæ sunt hujusmodi, similiter se habet genus boum,
   ut bores; et suum, at sues, et ovium, ut oves; et reliqua omnia.
   Justitia enim in iis apparel esse communitas. Deinde per communitatem
   omnia similiter secundum sua genera seminantur, et commune nutrimentum
   editur humi pascentibus jumentis omnibus, et omnibus ex æquo; ut quod
   nulla liege circumscriptum sit, sed ejus, qui donat, jubentis
   suppeditatione, convenienter justeque adsit omnibus. Sed neque
   generationi posita est lex, esset enim jamdiu abolita: ex æquo autem
   seminant et generant, habentia innatam a justitia communionera: ex æquo
   communiter omnibus oculum ad videndum, creator et pater omnium, sua
   justitia legera ferens, præbuit, non discernens feminam a masculor non
   id quod est rationis particeps, ab experte rationis, el, ut semel
   dicam, nullum a nullo; sed æqualitate et communitate visum similiter
   dividens, uno jussu omnibus est largitus. Leges autem, inquit, hominum,
   cum ignorationem castigare non possent, contra leges facere docuerunt:
   legum enim proprietas dissecuit divinæ legis communionem et arrodit;
   non intelligens dictum Apostoli dicentis: Per legem peccatum cognovi.'
   Et meum et tuum dicit subiisse per leges, ut quæ non amplius communiter
   fruantur (sunt enim communia), neque terra, neque possessionibus, sed
   neque matrimonio. Fecit enim rites communiter omnibus, quæ neque
   passerem, neque furem abnegant; et frumentum similiter, et alios
   fructus. Violata autem communio et æqualitas, genuit furem pecorum et
   fructuum. Cum ergo Deus communiter omnia fecisset homini, et feminam
   cure masculo communiter conjunxisset, et omnia similiter animantia
   conglutinasset, pronuntiavit justitiam, communionem cum æqualilate. Qui
   autem sic nati sunt, communionera, quæeorum conciliat generationem,
   abnegaverunt. Et dicit, si unam ducens habeat, cure omnium possint esse
   participes, sicut reliqua recit animantia." Hæc cum his verbis
   dixisset, subjungit rursus his verbis: "Intensam enim et vehementiorem
   ingeneravit masculis cupiditatem ad generum perpetuitatem, quam nec
   lex, nec mos, nec aliquid aliud potest abolere: est enim Dei decretum."
   Et quomodo amplius hic in nostra examinetur oratione, cum legem et
   Evangelium perhæc aperte destruat? Ilia enim dicit: "Non moechaberis."
   [2448] Hoc autem dicit: "Quicunque respicit ad concupiscentiam, jam
   moechatus est." [2449] Illud enim: "Non concupisces," [2450] quod a
   lege dicitur, ostendit unum esse Deum, qui præ dicatur per legem et
   prophetas et Evangelium. Dicit enim: "Non concupisces uxorem proximi
   tui." Proximus autem non est Judæus Judæo: frater enim est et eumdem
   habet Spiritum; restat ergo, ut propinquum dicat eum qui est alterius
   gentis. Quomodo autem non propinquus, qui aptus est esse Spiritus
   particeps? Non solum enim Hebræorum, sed etiam gentium pater est
   Abraham. Si autem quæ est adulterata, et qui in eam fornicatus est,
   capite punitur: [2451] clarum est utique præceptum, quod dicit: "Non
   concupisces uxorem propinqui tui," loqui de gentibus: ut cure quis
   secundum legera et ab uxore proximi eta sorore abstinuefit, aperte
   audiat a Domino: "Ego autem dico, non concupisces." Additio autem hujus
   particulæ "ego," majorem præcepti vim ostendit. Quod autem cure Deo
   bellum gerat Carpocrates, et Epiphanes etiam in eo, qui vulgo jactatur,
   libro De justilia, patet ex eo quod subjungit his verbis: "Hinc ut qui
   ridiculum dixerit, legislatoris hoc verbum audiendum est: Non
   concupisces:' usque ad id, quod magis ridicule dicit: Res proximi tui.'
   Ipse enim, qui dedit cupiditatem, ut quæ contineret generationem, jubet
   eam auferre, cum a nullo earn auferat animali. Illud autem: Uxorein
   proximi mi,' quo communionera cogit ad proprietatem, dixit adhuc magis
   ridicule." Ethæc quidera dogmata constituunt egregii Carpocratiani. Hos
   dicunt et aliquos alios similium malorum æmulatores, ad coenas
   convenientes (neque enim dixerim "agapen" eorum congressionem) [2452]
   viros simul et mulieres, postquam cibis venerem excitantibus se
   expleverint, lumine amoto, quod eorum fornicatoriam hanc justitiam
   pudore afficiebat, aversa lucema, coire quomodo velint, et cure quibus
   velint: meditatos autem inejusmodi "agape" communionem, interdiu jam, a
   quibus velint mulieribus exigere Carpocrateæ (divinæ enim nefas est
   discere) legis obedientiam. Has leges, ut sentio, ferre opportuit
   Carpocratem canum et suum et hircorum libidinibus. Mihi autem videtur,
   Platonem quoque mate intellexisse, in Republica dicentem, oportere esse
   communes omnium uxores: ut qui diceret eas quidem, quæ nondum
   nupserant, esse communes eorum, qui essent petituri, quemadmodum
   theatram quoque est commune spectatorum; esse autem unamquamque
   uniuscujusque qui præoccupasset, et non amplius communem esse earn quæ
   nupsisset. Xanthus autem in iis, quæ scribuntur Magica: "Coeunt autem,"
   inquit, "magi cum matribus et filiabus: et fas esse aiunt coire cure
   sororibus, et communes esse uxores, non vi et clam, sed utrisque
   consentientibus, cure velit alter ducere uxorem alterius." De his et
   similibus hæresibus existimo Judam prophetice dixisse in epistola:
   "Similiter quidera hi quoque somniantes" (non enim vigilantes ad
   veritatem se applicant), usque ad illud: "Et os eorum loquitur
   superba." [2453]

      Caput III.--Quatenus Plato Aliique E Veteribus Præiverint Marcionitis
      Aliisque Hæreticis, Qui a Nuptiis Ideo Abstinent Quia Creaturam Malam
      Existimant Et Nasci Homines in Poenam Opinantur.

   Jam vero si et ipse Plato et Pythagorei, sicut etiam postea Marcionitæ,
   malam existimarunt esse generationem, longe abfuit, ut communes ipse
   poneret uxores. Sed Marcionitæ [2454] quidem dicunt malam esse naturam,
   ex mala materia, et a justo factam opifice ac Creatore. Qua quidera
   ratione nolentes implere mundum, qui factus est a Creatore, volunt
   abstinere a nuptiis, resistentes suo Creatori, et contendentes ad
   bonum, qui vocavit: sed non ad eum, qui, ut dicunt, Deus est diversis
   moribus præditus. Unde cum nihil hic velint relinquere proprium, non
   sunt ex destinato animi proposito continentes, sed propter odium
   conceptum adversum eum, qui creavit, nolentes iis uti, quæ ab ipso sunt
   creata. Sed hi quidem, qui propter impium, quod cum Deo gerunt, bellum,
   emoti sunt ab iis cogitationibus, quæ sunt secundum naturam, Dei
   longanimitatem contemnentes et benignitatem, etsi nolunt uxorem ducere,
   cibis tamen utuntur creatis, et ærem respirant Creatoris, ut quiet ejus
   sint opera, et in iis, quæ sunt ejus, permaneant, et inauditam ac novam
   quamdam, ut aiunt, annuntiatam audiunt cognitionem, etiamsi hoc quoque
   nomine mundi Domino deberent agere gratias, quod hic acceperint
   Evangelium. Sed adversus eos quidera, cure de principiis tractabimus,
   accuratissime disseremus. Philosophi autem, quorum mentionera fecimus,
   a quibus cure malam esse generationem irapie didicissent Marcionitæ,
   tanquam suo dogmate gloriantur, non eam volunt esse natura malam, sed
   anima, quæ veritatem divulgavit. Artimam enim, quam esse divinam
   fatentur, in hunc mundum deducunt, tanquam in locum supplicii. Oportet
   autem animas in corpus immissas expiari ex eorum sententia. Non
   convenit autem plius hoc dogma Marcionistis, sed iis, qui censent in
   corpora intrudi, et iis alligari, et quasi ex vase in vas aliud
   transfundi animas. Adversus quos fuerit aliud dicendi tempus, quando de
   anima tractabimus. Videtur itaque Heraclitus maledictis insequi
   generationem: "Quoniam autem," inquit, "nati volunt vivere, et mortes
   habere, vel potius quiescere; filios quoque relinquunt, ut mortes
   fiant." Clarum est autem cum eo conyenire Empedoclem quoque dicentem:--


   Deflevi et luxi, insolitum cernens miser orbem.

   Et amplius:--


   Mortua nam ex vivis fecit, species commutans.

   Et rursus:--


   Hei mihi! quam infelix horninure genus atque misellum

   Litibus ex quantis prognati et planctibus estis?

   Dicit autem Sibylla quoque:--


   Mortales homines, caro qui tantum, et nihil estis;

   Similiter atque poeta, qui scribit:--


   Haud homine infelix tellus mage quldquam alit alma.

   Quin etiam Theognis malam ostendit esse generationera, dicens hoc
   modo:--


   Optima non nasci res est mortalibus ægris,

   Nec nitidi soils luce micante frui,

   Extemplo aut natum portas invadere Ditis.

   His autem consequenria scribit quoque Euripides, poeta tragicus:--


   Nam nos decebat convenire publice, et

   Deflere natum, quod tot ingreditur mala:

   Ast mortuum, cuique jam quies data est,

   Efferre lætis gratulationibus.

   Et rursus similia sic dicit:--


   Quis novit, an vivere quidera siet mori,

   Siet mori autem vivere?

   Idem quod hi, videtur Herodotus quoque inducere dicentem Solonera: "O
   Croese, quivis homo nihil est aliud quam calamitas." Jam vero ejus de
   Cleobide et Bitone fabula plane nihil aliud vult, quam vituperare
   generationera, laudare autern morterm.

   Et qualis folii, est heminum generatia talis, ait Homerus. Plato autem
   in Cratylo, Orpheo tribuit eum sermonem, quo anima puniri in corpore
   dicitur: "Nempe corpus hoc animæ sema," monumentum, "quidam esse
   tradunt: quasi ipsa præsenti in tempore sit sepulta; atque etiam quia
   anima per corpus semainei," significat, "quæcunclue significare potest:
   iedo sema jure vocari. Videatur mihi præterea Orpheus nomen hoc ob id
   potissimum imposuisse, quod anima in corpore hoc delictorum luat
   poenas." Operæ pretium est autem meminisse etiam eorum, quæ dicit
   Philolaus. Sic enim dicit hic Pythagoreus: "Testantur autem veteres
   quoque theologi et vates, ad luenda supplicia animam conjunctam esse
   corpori, et in eo tanquam in monumento esse sepultam." Quin etiam
   Pindarus de iis, quæ sunt in Eleusine, mysteriis loquens, infert:
   "Beatus, qui cum ilia sub terra videtit communia, novit quidem vitæ
   finem, novit autem datum Jovis imperium." Et Plato similiter in
   Pædonene non veretur hoc modo scribere: "Porto autem hi, qui nobishæc
   constituerunt mysteria, non aliquid aliud," usque ad: "Et cure diis
   habitatlone." Quid vero, cum dieit: "Quandiu corpus habuefimus, et
   anima nostra cum ejusmodi malo admista fuerit, illud, quod desideramus,
   nunquam satis assequemur?" annon significat generationem esse causam
   maximorum malorum? Jam vero in Phædone quoque testatur: "Evenit enim,
   ut qui recte philosophantur, non animadvertantur ab aliis in nullam rem
   aliam suum studium conferre, quam ut emoriantur, et sint mortui." Et
   runus: "Ergo hic quoque philosophi anima corpus maxime vilipendit, et
   ab eo fugit, ipsa autem secum seorsim esse quærit." Nunquid autem
   consentit cum divino Apostolo, qui dicit: "Infelix ego homo, quis me
   liberabit a corpore mortis hujus?" [2455] nisi forte eorum
   consensionem, qui trahuntur in vitium, "corpus morris" dicit tropice.
   Atque coitum quoque, qui est principium generationis, vel ante
   Marcionem vietur Plato aversari in primo De republica: ubi cum
   laudasset senectutem, subjungit: "Velim scias, quod quo magis me
   deficiunt alise," nempe corporis, "voluptates, eo magis confabulandi
   cupiditas, et voluptas, quam ex ea re capio, augetur." rei veneree
   injecta esset menrio: "Bona verba quæso," inquit: "ego vero lubenter
   isthinc, tanquam ad insano aliquo et agresti domino, effugi?' Rursus in
   Phædone, vituperans generationem, dicit: "Quæ ergo de his in arcanis
   dicitur, hæc est oratio, quod nos homines sumus in custodia allqua." Et
   rursus: "Qui autem pie præcæ teris vixisse inveniuntur, hi sunt, qui ex
   his terrenis locis, tanquam e carcere, soluti atque liberati, ad puram
   in altioribus locis habitationem transcendunt." Sed tamen quamvis ita
   se habeat, recte a Deo mundum administrari existimat; unde dicit: "Non
   oportet autem seipsum solvere, nec effugere." Et ut paucis dicam, non
   dedit Marcioni occasionem, ut malam existimaret materiam, cum ipse pie
   de mundohæc dixerit: "Ab eoenim, qui ipsum construxit, habet omnia
   bona: a priori autem deformirate incommoda et injusta omnia, quæ intra
   coelum nascuntur, mundus ipse sustinet, et animantibus inserit." Adhuc
   autem subjungit manifestius: "Cujus quidem defectus est coporea
   temperatura, priscæ naturge comes; ham quiddam valde deforme erat, et
   ordinis expert, priusquampræsenti ornatu decoraretur." Nihilominus
   autem in Legibus quoque deflet humanum genus, sic dicens: "Dii autem
   hominum genus laboribus naturæ pressum miserati, remissiones ipsis
   statuerunt laborum, solemnium videlicit festorum vicissitudines." Et in
   Epinomide persequitur etiam causas, cur sint horninure miserti, et sic
   dicit: "Ab initio ipsum esse genitum, est grave cuilibet animanti:
   primum quidem, quod eorum constitutionis sint participes, quæ in utero
   gestantur; deinde ipsum nasci, et præterea nutriri et erudiri, per
   irmumerabiles labores universa fiunt, ut omnes dicimus." Quid vero?
   annon Heraclitus generationera quoque dicit esse mortem? Pythagoras
   autem similiter atque Socrates in Gorgia, cum dicit: "Mors est, quæ
   unque experrecti videmus: quæ cunque autem dormientes, somnus." Sed de
   his quidem satis. Quando autem tractabimus de principiis, tune et has
   repugnantias, quas et innuunt philosophi, et suis dogmatibus decernunt
   Marcionistæ, considerabimus. Cæterum satis dilucide ostensas esse
   existimo, externorum alienorumque dogmaturn occasiones Marcionem
   ingrate et indocte accepisse a Platone. Nobis autem procedar sermo de
   continentia. Dicebamus autem" Græcos adversus liberorum generationem
   multa dixisse, incommoda, quæ comitari eam solent, respicientes: quæ
   cum impie excepissent Marcionitæ, impie fuisse ingratos in Creatorem.
   Dicit enim tragoedia:--


   Non nascier præstat homines, quam nastier.

   Dein filios acerbis cum coloribus

   Enitor, ast enixa, si stolidi scient,

   Afflictor, intuendo quod servo malos,

   Bonosque perdo. Si bonos servo, tamen


   Mihi miscellum cor timore liquitur.

   Quid hic boni ergo est? unicam annon sufficit

   Effundere animam, nisi crucieris amplius?

   Et adhuc similiter:--


   Vetus stat mihi persuasio,

   Plantare filios nunquam hominem oportuit,

   Dum cernit ad quot gignimus natos mala.

   In his autem, quæ deinceps sequuntur, malorum quoque causam evidenter
   reducit ad principia, sic dicens:--


   O! miser natus, malisque obnoxius

   Editus, homo, es, vitæ tuæque miserriam

   Hinc inchoasti: coepit æther omnibus

   Spiramen unde alens tradere mortalibus;

   Mortalis ægre ne feras mortalia.

   Rursus autem his similia tradit:--


   Mortalium omnium beatus non fuit

   Quisquam, molestia et nemo carens fuit.

   Et deinde rursus:--


   Heu! quanta, quotque hominibus eveniunt mala,

   Quam vana, quorum terminus nullus datur.

   Et adhuc similiter:--


   Nemo beatus semper est mortalium.

   Hac itaque ratione dicunt etiam Pythagoreos abstinere a rebus venereis.
   Mihi autem contra videntur uxores quidem ducere, ut liberos suscipiant,
   velle autem a venerea voluptate se continere post susceptos liberos.
   Proinde mystice uti fabis prohibent, non quod sit legumen flatum
   excitens, et concoctu difficile, et somnia efficiat turbulenta; neque
   quod hominis capiti sit sireills ut vult ille versiculus:--


   Idem est namque fabam atque caput corrodere patris;

   sed potius quod fabæ, si comedantur, steriles efficiant mulieres.
   Theophrastus quidem certe in quinto libro De causis plantarum, fabarum
   siliquas, si ponantur ad radices arborum quæ nuper sunt plantatæ,
   refert plantas exsiccare. Quinetiam gallinæ domesticæ, quæ eas assidue
   comedunt, efficiuntur steriles.

      Caput IV.--Quibus Prætextibus Utantur Hæretici ad Omnis Genetis Licentiam
      Et Libidinem Exercendam.

   Ex iis autem, qui ab hæresi ducuntur, Marciohis quidem Pontici fecimus
   mentionem, qui propter certamen, quod adversus Creatorem suscepit,
   mundanarum rerum usum recusat. Ei autem continentiæ causa est, si modo
   est ea dicenda continentia, ipse Creator, cui se adversari existimans
   gigas iste cum Deo pugnans, est invitus continens, dum in creationem et
   Dei opus invehitur. Quod si usurpent vocem Domini, qui dicit Philippo:
   "Sine mortuos sepelire mortuos suos, tu autem sequere me:" [2456] at
   illud considerent, quod similem cam is formationem fert quoque
   Philippus, non habens cadaver pollutum. Quomodo ergo cum carhem
   haberet, non habuit cadaver? Quoniam surrexit ex monumento, Domino ejus
   vitia morte afficiente, vixit autem Christo. Meminimus autem nefariæ
   quoque ex Carpocratis sententia mulierum communionis. Cum autem de
   dicto Nicolai loqueremur, illud præ termisimus: Cum formosam, aiunt,
   haberet uxorem, et post Servatoris assumptionem ei fuisset ab apostolis
   exprobrata zelotypia, in medium adducta muliere, permisit cui vellet
   eam nubere. Aiunt enim hanc actionem illi voci consentaneam, quæ dicit,
   quod "carne abuti oporteat." Proinde ejus factum et dictum absolute et
   inconsiderate sequentes, qui ejus hæresim persequuntur, impudenter
   effuseque fornicantur. Ego autem audio Nicolaum quidem nulla unquam
   alia, quam ea, quæ ei nupserat, uxore usum esse; et ex illius liberis,
   filias quidem consenuisse virgines, filium autem permansisse
   incorruptum. Quæ cum ita se habeant, vitii erat depulsio atque
   expurgatio, in medium apostolorum circumactio uxoris, cujus dicebatur
   laborare zelotypia: et continentia a voluptatibus, quæ magno studio
   parari solent, docebat illud, "abuti carne," hoc est, exercere carnem.
   Neque enim, ut existimo, volebant, convenienter Domini præcepto,
   "duobus dominis servire," [2457] voluptati et Deo. Dicunt itaque
   Matthiam [2458] quoque sic docuisse: "Cum carne quidem pugnare, et ea
   uti, nihil ei impudicum largiendo ad voluptatem; augere autem animam
   per fidem et cognitionem." Sunt autem, qui etiam publicam venerem
   pronuntiant mysticam communionem; et sic ipsum nomen contumelia
   afficiunt. Sicut enim operari eum dicimus, tum qui malum aliquod facit,
   tum etiam qui bonum, idem nomen utrique tribuentes; haud aliter
   "communio" usurpari solet; nam bona quidem est in communicatione tum
   peeuniæ, tum nutrimenti et yestitus: illi autem quamlibet veneream
   conjunctionem impie vocaverunt "communionem." Dicunt itaque ex iis
   quemdam, cum ad hostram virginem vultu formosam accessisset, dixisse:
   Scriptum est: "Da omni te petenti:" [2459] illam autem honeste admodum
   respondisse, ut quse non intelligeret hominis petulantiam: At tu matrem
   conveni de matrimonio. O impietatem! etiam voces Domini ementiuntur
   isti intemperantiæ communicatores, fratresque libidinis, non solum
   probrum philosophiæ, sed etiam totius vitæ; qui veritatem, quantum in
   eis situm est, adulterant ac corrumpunt, vel potius defodiunt; homines
   infelicissimi carnalem concubitus communionem consecrant, et hanc ipsos
   putant ad regnum Dei perducere. Ad lupanaria ergo deducithæc communio,
   et cure eis communicaverint sues et hirci, maximaque apud illos in spe
   fuerint meretrices, quæ in prostibulis præsto sunt, et volentes omnes
   admittunt. "Vos autem non sic Christum didicistis, siquidem ipsum
   audiistis, et in eo docti estis, quemadmodum est veritas in Christo
   Jesu, ut deponatis quæ sunt secundum veterem conversationem, veterem
   hominem, qui corrumpitur secundum desideria deceptionis. Renovamini
   autem spiritu mentis vestræ, et induatis novum hominem, qui creatus est
   secundum Deum in justitia et sanctitate veritatis," [2460] ad Dei
   similitudinem. "Efficimini ergo Dei imitatores, ut filii dilecti, et
   ambulate in dilectione, sicut Christus quoque dilexit nos, et tradidit
   seipsum pro nobis oblationem et hostiam Deo in odorem suavitatis.
   Fornicatio autem, et omnis immunditia, vel avaritia, ne nominetur
   quidem in vobis, sicut decet sanctos, et turpitudo, et stultiloquium."
   [2461] Etenim docens Apostolus meditari vel ipsa voce esse castos,
   scribit: "Hoc enim scitote, quod omnis fornicator," et cætera, usque ad
   illud: "Magis autem arguite." [2462] Effluxit autem eis dogma ex quodam
   apocrypho libro. Atque adeo afferam dictionem, quæ mater eorum
   intemperantiæ et origo est: et sive ipsi hujus libri scriptores se
   fateantur, en eorum recordiam, licet Deo eum falso ascribant libidinis
   intemperantia ducti: sive ab aliis, eos perverse audientes, hoc
   præclarum dogma acceperint, sic porto se habent ejus verba: "Unum erant
   omnia: postquam autem ejus unitati visum est non esse solam, exiit ab
   eo inspiratio, et cum ea iniit communionem, et fecit dilectum. Exhinc
   autem egressa est ab ipso inspiratio, cum qua cure communionem
   iniisset, fecit porestates, quæ nec possunt videri nec audiri," usque
   ad illud, "unamquamque in nomine proprio." Si enim hi quoque, sicut
   Valentiniani, spiritales posuissent communiones, suscepisset forte
   aliquis eorum opinionem: carnalis autem libidinis communionem ad
   sanctam inducere prophetiam, est ejus qui desperat salutem. Talia etiam
   statuunt Prodici quoque asseclæ, qui seipsos falso nomine vocant
   Gnosticos: seipsos quidem dicentes esse natura filios primi Dei; ea
   vero nobilitate et libertate abutentes, vivunt ut volunt; volunt autem
   libidinose; se nulla re teneri arbitrati, ut "domini sabbati," et qui
   sint quovis genere superiores, filii regales. Regi autem, inquiunt, lex
   scripta non est. Primum quidem, quod non faciant omnia quæ volunt:
   multa enim cos prohibebunt, etsi cupiant et conentur. Quinetiam quæ
   faciunt, non faciunt ut reges, sed ut mastigiæ: clanculum enim
   commitrunt adulteria, timerites ne deprehendantur, et vitantes ne
   condemntur, et metuentes ne supplicio afficiantur. Quomodo etiam res
   est libera, intemperantia et turpis sermo? "Omnis enim, qui peccat, est
   servus," inquit Apostolus. [2463] Sed quomodo vitiam ex Deo instituit,
   qui seipsum præ buit dedititium cuivis concupiscentiæ? cum dixerit
   Dominus: "Ego autem dico: Ne concupiscas." Vultne autem aliquis sua
   sponte peccare, et decernere adulteria esse committenda,
   voluptatibusque et deliciis se explendum, et aliorum violanda
   matrimonia, cum aliorum etiam, qui inviti peccant, misereamur? Quod si
   in externum mundum venerint, qui in alieno non fuerint fideles, verum
   non babebunt. Afficit autem hospes aliquis elves contumelia, et eis
   injuriam facit; et non potius ut peregrinus, utens necessariis, vivit,
   cives non offendens? Quomodo autem, cum eadem faciant, ac ii, quos
   gentes odio habent, quod legibus obtemperare nolint, nempe iniqui, et
   incontinentes, et avari, et adulteri, dicunt se solos Deum nosse?
   Oporteret enim eos, cum in alienis adsunt, recte vivere, ut revera
   regiam indolem ostenderent. Jam vero et humanos legislatores, et
   divinam legera habent sibi infensam, cum inique et præter leges vivere
   instituerint. Is certe, qui scortatorein "confodit," a Deo plus esse
   ostenditur in Numeris. "Et si dixerimus," inquit Joannes in epistola,
   "quod societatem habemus cum eo," nempe Deo, "et in tenebris ambulamus,
   mentitour, et veritatem non facimus. Si autem in luce ambulamus, sicut
   et ipse est in luce, societatem habemus cum ipso, et sanguis Jesu filii
   ejus emundat nos a peccato." [2464] Quomodo ergo sunt hi hujus mundi
   hominibus meliores, qui hæc faciunt, et vel pessimis hujus mundi sunt
   similes? sunt enim, ut arbitror, similes natura, qui sunt factis
   similes. Quibus autem se esse censent nobilitate superiores, eos debent
   etiam superare moribus, ut vitent ne includantur in carcere. Revera
   enim, ut dixit Dominus: "Nisi abundavetit justitia vestra plus quam
   scribarum et Pharisæorum, non intrabitis in regnum Dei." [2465] De
   abstinentia autem a cibis ostenditur a Daniele. [2466] Ut semel autem
   dicam, de obedientia dicit psallens David: "In quo diriget junior viam
   suam?" [2467] Et statim audit: "In custodiendo sermones tuos in toto
   corde." Et dicit Jeremias: "Hæc autem dicit Dominus: Per vias gentium
   ne ambulaveritis." [2468] Hinc moti aliqui alii, pusilli et nullius
   pretii, dicunt formatum fuisse hominem a diversis potestatibus: et quæ
   sunt quidem usque ad umbilicum esse artis divinioris; quæ autem subter,
   minoris; qua de causa coitum quoque appetere. Non animadvertunt autem,
   quod superiores quoque partes nutrimentum appetunt, et quibusdam
   libidinantur. Adversantur autem Christo quoque, qui dixit Pharisæis,
   eundem Deum et "internum" nostrum et "externum" fecisse hominem. [2469]
   Quinetiam appetitio non est corporis, etsi fiat per corpus. Quidam
   alii, quos etiam vocamus Antitactas, hoc est "adversarios" et
   repugnantes, dicunt quod Deus quidera universorum noster est natura
   pater, et omnia quæ cunque fecit, bona sunt; unus autem quispiam ex
   iis, qui ab ipso facti sunt, seminatis zizaniis, malorum naturam
   generavit: quibus etiam nos omnes implicavit, ut nos efficeret Patri
   adversarios. Quare nos etiam ipsi huic adversamur ad Patrem
   ulciscendum, contra secundi voluntatem facientes. Quoniam ergo hic
   dixit: "Non moechaberis:" nos, inquiunt, moechamur, ut ejus mandatum
   dissolvamus. Quibus responderimus quoque, quod pseudoprophetas, et eos
   qui veritatem simulant, ex operibus cognosci accepimus: si male audiunt
   autem vestra opera, quomodo adhuc dicetis vos veritatem tenere? Aut
   enim nullum est malum, et non est utique dignus reprehensione is, quem
   vos insimulatis, ut qui Deo sit adversatus, neque fuit alicujus mali
   effector; una enim cum malo arbor quoque interimitur: aut si est malum
   ac consistit, dicant nobis, quid dicunt esse ea, quæ data sunt,
   præcepta, de justitia, de continentia, de tolerantia, de patientia, et
   iis, quæ sunt hujusmodi, bona an mala? et si fuerit quidera malum
   præceptum, quod plurima prohibet facere turpia, adversus seipsum legem
   feret vitium, ut seipsum dissolvat, quod quidem non potest fieri; sin
   autem bonum, cure bonis adversentur præceptis, se bono adversari, et
   mala facere confitentur. Jam vero ipse quoque Servator, cui soil
   censent esse parendum, odio bere, et maledictis insequi prohibuit et,
   "Cum adversario," inquit, "vadens, ejus amicus conare discedere."
   [2470] Aut ergo Christi quoque negabunt suasionem, adversantes
   adversario: aut, si sint amici, contra eum certamen suscipere nolunt.
   Quid vero? an nescitis, viri egregii (loquor enim tanquam præsentibus),
   quod cure præceptis, quæ se recte habent, pugnantes, propriæ saluti
   resistis? Non enim ea, quæ sunt utiliter edicta, sed vos ipsos
   evertitis. Et Dominus: "Luceant" quidera, inquit, "bona vestra opera:"
   [2471] vos autem libidines et intemperantias vestras manifestas
   redditis. Et alioqui si vultis legislatoris præcepta dissolvere, quanam
   de causa, illud quidem: "Non moechaberis;" et hoc: "Stuprom puero non
   inferes," et quæ cunque ad continentiam conferunt, dissolvere conamini,
   propter vestram intemperantiam non dissolvitis autem, quæ ab ipso fit,
   hiemem, ut media adhuc hieme æstatem faciatis: neque terram
   navigabilem, mare autem pedibus pervium, facitis, ut qui historias
   composuerunt, barbarum Xerxem dicunt voluisse facere? Cur vero non
   omnibus præceptis repugnatis? Nam cum ille dicat; "Crescite et
   multiplicamini," [2472] oporteret vos, qui adversamini, nullo modo uti
   coitu. Et cure dixit: "Dedi vobis omnia ad vescendum" [2473] et
   fruendum, vos nullo frui oportuit. Quinetiam eo dicente: "Oculum pro
   oculo," [2474] oportuit vos decertationem contraria non rependere
   decertatione. Et cure furem jusserit reddere "quadruplum," [2475]
   oportuit vos furl aliquid etiam adhere. Rursus vero similiter, cum
   præcepto: "Diliges Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo," [2476] repugnetis,
   oportuit nec universomm quidem Deum diligere. Et rursus, cum dixent:
   "Non facies sculptile neque fusile," [2477] consequens erat ut etiam
   sculptilia adoraretis. Quomodo ergo non impie facitis, qui Creatori
   quidem, ut dicitis, resistiris; quæ sunt autem meretricibus et
   adulteris similia, sectamini? Quomodo autem non sentiris vos eum
   majorem facere, quem pro imbecillo habetis; si quidera id fit, quod hic
   vult; non autem illud, quod voluit bonus? contra enim ostenditur quodam
   modo a vobis ipsis, imbecillum esse, quem vestrum patrem dicitis.
   Recensent etiam ex quibusdam locis propheticis decerptas dictiones, et
   male consarcinatas, quæ allegorice dicta sunt tanquam recto ductu et
   citra figuram dicta sumentes. Dicunt enim scriptum esse: "Deo
   restiterunt, et salvi facti sunt:" [2478] illi autem "Deo impudenti"
   addunt; et hoc eloquium tanquam consilium præceptum accipiunt: et hoc
   ad salutem conferre existimant, quod Creatori resistant. At "impudenti"
   quidem "Deo," non est scriptum. Si autem sic quoque habeat, eum, qui
   vocatus est diabolus, inteligite impudentem: vel quod hominem calumniis
   impetat, vel quod accuset peccatores, vel quod sit apostata. Populus
   ergo, de quo hoc dictum est, cum castigaretur propter sua peocata, ægre
   ferentes et gementes, his verbis, quædicta sunt, murmurabant, quod aliæ
   quidem gentes cum inique se gerant non puniantur, ipsi autem in
   singulis vexentur; adeo ut Jeremias quoque dixerit: "Cur via impiorum
   prosperatur?" [2479] quod simile est ie, quod prius allatum est ex
   Malachia: "Deo restiterunt, et salvi facti sunt." Nam prophetæ
   divinitus inspirati, non solum quæ a Deo audierint, se loqui
   profitentur; sed et ipsi etiam solent ea, quæ vulgo jactantur a populo,
   exceptionis modo, edicere, et tanquam quæ stiones ab hominibus motas
   referre: cujusmodi est illud dictum, cujus mentio jam facta est.
   Nunquid autem ad hos verba sua dirigens, scribit Apostolus in Epistola
   ad Romanos: "Et non sicut blasphemamur, et sicut dicunt aliqui nos
   dicere: Faciamus mala, ut eveniant bona, quorum justa est damnatio?"
   [2480] Ii sunt, qui inter legendum tono vocis pervertunt Scripturas ad
   proprias voluptates, et quorumdam accentuum et punctorum
   transpositione, quæ prudenter et utiliter præcepta sunt, as suas
   trahunt delicias. "Qui irritatis Deum sermonibus vestris," inquit
   Malachias, "et dicitis, in quonam eum irritavimus; Dum vos dicitis:
   Quicunque facit malum, bonus est coram Domino, et ipse in eis
   complacuit; et ubi est Deus justitiæ?" [2481]

      Caput V.--Duo Genera Hæreticorum Notat: Prius Illorum Qui Omnia Omnibus
      Licere Pronuntiant, Quos Refutat.

   Ne ergo hunc locum ungue amplius fodicantes plurium absurdalum hæresium
   meminerimus; nec rursus dum in singulis adversus unamquamque dicere
   necesse habemus, propterea pudore afficiamur, et nimis prolixos hos
   faciamus commenratios, age in duo dividentes omnes hæreses, eis
   respondeamus. [2482] Aut enim docent indiscrete vivere: aut modum
   excedentes, per inpietatem et odium profitentur continentiam. Prius
   autem tractandum est de prima parte. Quod si quodlibet vitæ genus licet
   eligere, tum earn scilicet etiam licet, quæ est continens: et si
   electus tute poterit quodlibet vitæ genus sectari, manifestum est eam,
   quæ temperanter et secundum virtutem agitur, longe tutissimam esse. Nam
   cum "domino sabbati," etiamsi intemperanter vivat, nulla ratio reddenda
   sit, multo magis qui vitam moderate et temperate instituit, nulli erit
   rationi reddendæ obnoxius. "Omnia enim licent, sed non omnia
   expediunt," [2483] ait Apostolus. Quod si omnia licent, videlicet
   moderatum quoque esse et temperantem. Quemadmodum ergo is est
   laudandus, qui libertate sua usus est ad vivendum ex virtute: ita multo
   magis qui dedit nobis liberam nostri potestatem, et concessit vivere ut
   vellemus, est venerandus et adorandus, quod non permiserit, ut nostra
   electio et vitatio cuiquam necessario serviret. Si est autem uterque
   æque securus, et qui incontinentiam, et qui continentiam elegerit, non
   est tamen ex æquo honestum et decorum. Qui enim impegit in voluptates,
   gratificatur corpori: temperans autem animam corporis dominam liberat a
   perturbationibus. Et si dicant nos "vocatos fuisse in libertatem,
   solummodo ne præbeamus libertatem, in occasionem carni," [2484] ex
   sententia Apostoli. Si autem cupiditati est obsequendum, et quæ
   probrosa estet turpis vita tanquam indifferens est eligenda, ut ipsi
   dicunt; aut cupiditatibus est omnino parendum, et si hoc ita est,
   facienda sunt quævis impudicissima et maxime nefaria, eos sequendo, qui
   nobis persuadent: ant sunt aliquæ declinandæ cupiclitates, et non est
   amplius vivendum indifferenter, neque est impudenter serviendum
   vilissimis et abjectissimis nostris partibus, ventri et pudendis, dum
   cupidate ducti nostro blandimur cadaveri. Nutritur enim et vivificatur
   cupiditas, dum ei voluptates ministrantur: quemadmodum rursus si
   impediatur et interturbetur, flaccescit. Quomodo autem fieri potest, ut
   qui victus est a voluptatibus corporis, Domino assimiletur, ant Dei
   habeat cognitionem? Omnis enim voluptatis principium est cupiditas:
   cupiditas autem est molestia et sollicitudo, quæ propter egestatem
   aliquid appetit. Quare nihil aliud mihi videntur, qui hanc vitæ
   ratiohem suscipiunt, quam quod dicitur,


   Ultra ignominiam sentire dolores;

   ut qui malum a se accersitum, nunc et in posterum eligant. Si ergo
   "omnia licerent," nec timendum esset ne a spe excideremus propter malas
   actiones, esset fortasse eis aliquis præ textus, cur male viverent et
   miserabiliter. Quoniam autem vita beata nobis ostensa est per præcepta,
   quam oportet omnes sequentes, nec aliquid eorum, quæ dicta sunt,
   perperam intelligentes, nec eorum, quæ convenit, aliquid, etsi sit vel
   minimum, contemnentes, sequi quo Iogos ducit; quiâ, si ab eo
   aberraverimus, in malum immortale incidamus necesse est; si divinam
   autem Scripturam secuti fuerimus, per quam ingrediuntur, qui
   crediderunt, ut Domino, quoad fieri potest, assimilentur, non est
   vivendum indifferenter, sed pro viribus mundos esse oportet a
   voluptatibus et cupiditatibus, curaque est gerenda animæ, qua apud
   solum Deum perseverandum est. Mens enim, quæ est munda et ab omni vitio
   libera, est quodammodo apta ad potestatem Dei suscipiendam, cum divina
   in ea assurgat imago: "Et quicunque habet hanc spem in Domino,
   seipsum," inquit, "mundum castumque facit, quatenus ille est castus."
   [2485] Ut ii autem accipiant Dei cognitionem, qui adhuc ducuntur ab
   affectibus, minime potest fieri: ergo nec ut finem assequantur, cum
   nullam habeant Dei cognitionem. Et eum quidem, qui hunc finem non
   assequitur, accusare videtur Dei ignoratio; ut Deus autem ignoretur,
   efficit vitæ institutio. Omnino enim fieri non potest, ut quis simul
   sit et scientia præditus, et blandiri corpori non erubescat. Neque enim
   potest unquam convenire, quod voluptas sit bonum, cure eo, quod bonum
   sit solum pulchrum et honesturn: vel etiam cure eo, quod solus sit
   pulcher Dominus, et solus bonus Dens, et solus amabilis. "In Christo
   autem circumcisi estis, circumcisione non manu facta, in exspoliatione
   corporis carnis, in circumcisione Christi. [2486] Si ergo cum Christo
   consurrexistis, quæ sursum sunt quærite, quæ sursum sunt sapite, non
   quæ sunt super terram. Mortui enim estis, et vita vestra absconsa est
   cum Christo in Deo;" non autem ea, quam exercent, fornicatio.
   "Mortificate ergo membra, quæ sunt super terram, fornicationem,
   immunditiam, passionem, desiderium, propter quæ venit ira Dei.
   Deportant ergo ipsi quoque iram, indignationem, vitium, maledictum,
   turpem sermonem ex ore suo, exuentes veterem hominem cum
   concupiscentiis, et induentes novum, qui renovatur in agnitionem, ad
   imaginem ejus, qui creavit ipsum." [2487] Vitæ enim institutio aperte
   eos arguit, qui mandata novere: qualis enim sermo, tails est vita.
   Arbor autem cognoscitur ex fructibus, non ex floribus et foliis ac
   ramis. Cognitio ergo est ex fructu et vitæ institutione, non ex sermone
   et flore. Non enim nudum sermonera dicimus esse cognitionem, sed
   quamdam divinam scientiam, et lucem illam, quæ innata animæ ex
   præceptorum obedientia, omnia, quæ per generationem oriuntur, manifesta
   facit, et hominem instruit, ut seipsum cognoscat, et qua ratione compos
   fieri possit, edocet. Quod enim oculus est in corpore, hoc est in mente
   cognitio. Neque dicant libertatem, qua quis voluptati servit, sicut ii,
   qui bilem dicunt dulcem. Nos enim didicimus libertatem, qua Dominus
   noster nos liberat a voluptatibus, eta cupiditatibus, et aliis
   perturbationibus solvens. "Qui dicit: Novi Dominum, et mandata ejus non
   setvat, mendax est, et in eo veritas non est," [2488] ait Joannes.

      Caput VI.--Secundum Genus Hæreticorum Aggreditur, Illorum Scilicet Qui Ex
      Impia de Deo Omnium Conditore Sententia, Continentiam Exercent.

   Adversus autem alterurn genus hæreticorum, [2489] qui speciose per
   continentiam impie se gerunt, tum in creaturam, tum in sanctum
   Opificem, qui est solus Deus omnipotens; et dicunt non esse admittendum
   matrimonium et liberorum procreationem, nec in mundum esse inducendos
   alios infelices futuros, nec suppeditandum morti nutrimenturn, hæc sunt
   opponenda: primum quidem illud Joannis: "Et nunc antichristi multifacti
   sunt, unde scimus quod novissima hora est. Ex nobis exierunt, sed non
   erant ex nobis. Nam si fuissent ex nobis, permansissent utique
   nobiscum." [2490] Deinde sunt etiam evertendi, et dissolvenda, quæ ab
   eis afferuntur, hoc modo: "Salomæ interroganti, quousque vigebit mors,"
   non quasi vita esset mala, et mala creatura, "Dominus, Quoadusque,
   inquit, vos mulieres paritis," sed quasi naturalem docens
   consequentiam: ortum enim omnino sequitur interitus. Vult ergo lex
   quidem nos a deliciis omnique probro et dedecore educere. Et hic est
   ejus finis, ut nos ab injustitia ad justitiam deducamur, honesta
   eligendo matrimonia, et liberorum procreationem, bonamque vitæ
   institutionem. Dominus autem "Non venit ad solvendam legem, sed ad
   implendam:" [2491] ad implendam autem, non ut cui aliquid deesset, sed
   quod legis prophetiæ per ejus adventum completæ fuerint. Nam recta vitæ
   institutio, iis etiam, qui juste vixerunt ante legem, per Logon præ
   dicabatur. Vulgus ergo hominum, quod non novit continentiam, corpore
   vitam degit, sed non spiritu: sine spiritu autem corpus nihil aliud est
   quam terra et cinis. lam adulterium judicat Dominus ex cogitatione.
   Quid enim? annon licet etiam continenter uti matrimonio, et non conari
   dissolvere, quod "conjunxit Deus?" [2492] Talia enim docent conjugii
   divisores, propter quod nomen probris ac maledictis appetitur inter
   gentes. Sceleratum autem dicentes isti esse coitum, qui ipsi quoque
   suam essentiam ex coitu accepere, quomodo non fuerint scelerati? Eorum
   autem, qui sunt sanctificati, sanctum quoque, ut puto, semen est. Ac
   nobis quidera debet esse sanctificatus, non solum spiritus, sed et
   mores, et vita, et corpus. Nam quaham ratione dicit Paulus apostolus
   esse "sanctificatam mulierem a viro," aut "virum a muliere?" [2493]
   Quid est autem, quod Dominus quoque dixit iis, qui interrogabant de
   divortio: "An liceat uxorem dimittere, cum Moyses id permiserit?" "Ad
   duritiam cordis vestri, inquit, Moyseshæc scripsit. Vos autem non
   legistis, quod protoplasto Deus dixit: Eritis duo in carne una? Quare
   qui dimittit uxorem, præterquam fornicationis causa, facit eam
   moechari. [2494] Sed post resurrectionem, inquit, nec uxorem ducunt,
   nec hubnut.'" [2495] Etenim de ventre et cibis dictum est: "Escæ
   ventri, et venter escis; Deus antem et illum et has destruet;" [2496]
   hos impetens, qui instar caprorum et hircorum sibi vivendum esse
   censent, ne secure ac sine terrore comessent et coirent.

   Si resurrectionem itaque receperint, ut ipsi dienut, et ideo
   matrimonium infirmant et abrogant; nec comedant, nec bibant: "destrui"
   enim "ventrem et cibos," dicit Apostolus in resurrectione. Quomodo ergo
   esuriunt, et sitiunt, et camis patiuntur affectiones, et alia, quæ non
   patietur, qui per Christum accepit perfectam, quæ speratur,
   resurrectionem? Quin etiam ii, qui colunt idola, a cibis et venere
   abstinent. "Non est" autem, inquit, "regnum Dei cibus est potus."
   [2497] Certe magis quoque curæ est, qui angelos colunt et dæmones,
   simul a vino et animatis et rebus abstinere venereis. Quemadmodum autem
   humilitas est mansuetudo, non autem afflictio corporis: ita etiam
   continentia est animæ virtus, quæ non est in manifesto, sed in occulto.
   Sunt autem etiam, qui matrimonium aperte dicunt fornicationem, et
   decernunt id traditum esse a diabolo. Dicunt autem gloriosi isti
   jactatores se imitari Dominum, qui neque uxorem duxit, neque in mundo
   aliquid possedit; se magis quam alii Evangelium intellexisse
   gloriantes. Eis autem dicit Scriptura: "Deus superbis resistit,
   humilibus autem dat gratiam." [2498] Deinde nesciunt causam cur Dominas
   uxorem non duxerit. Primum quidem, propriam sponsam habuit Ecclesiam:
   deinde vero, nec homo erat communis, ut opus haberet etiam adjutore
   aliquo secundum carnem; neque erat ei necesse procreare filios, qui
   manet in æternum, et natus est solus Dei Filius. Hic ipse autem Dominus
   dicit: "Quod Deus conjunxit, homo ne separet." [2499] Et rursus: "Sicut
   autem erat in diebus Noe, erant nubentes, et nuptui dantes,
   ædificantes, et plantantes; et sicut erat in diebus Lot, ita erit
   adventus Filii hominis." [2500] Et quod hoc non dicit ad genies,
   ostendit, cum subjungit: "Num cum venerit Filius hominis, inveniet
   fidem in terra?" [2501] Et rursus: "Væ prægnantibus et lactantibus in
   illis diebus." [2502] Quanquamhæc quoque dicuntur allegorice. Propterea
   nec "tempora" præ finiit, "quge Pater posuit in sua potestate," [2503]
   ut permaneret mundus per generationes. Illud autem: "Non omnes capiunt
   verbum hoc: sunt enim eunuchi, qui sic nati sunt; et sunt eunuchi, qui
   castrati sunt ab hominibus; et sunt eunuchi, qui seipsos castrarunt
   propier regnum coelorum. Qui potest capere, capiat;" [2504] nesciunt
   quod, postquam de divortio esset locutus, cum quidam rogassent: "Si sic
   sit causa uxoris, non expedit homini uxorem ducere;" tunc dixit
   Dominus: "Non omnes capiunt vetbum hoc, sed quibus datum est." [2505]
   Hoc enim qui rogabant, volebant ex eo scire, an uxore damnata et ejecta
   propter fornicationem, concedar aliam ducere. Aiunt autem athletas
   quoque non paucos abstinere a venere, propier exercitationem corporis
   continentes: quemadmodum Crotoniatem Astylum, et Crisonem Himeræum.
   Quinetiam Amoebeus citharoedus, cum recenter matrimonio junctus esset,
   a sponsa abstinuit: et Cyrenæus Aristoteles amantem Laidem solus
   despexit. Cum meretrici itaque jurasset, se eam esse in patriam
   abducturum, si sibi adversus decertantes advesarios in aliquibus opem
   tulisset, postquam id perfecisset, lepide a se dictum jusjurandum
   exsequens, cum curasset imaginem ejus quam simillimam depingi, eam
   Cyrenæ statuit, ut scribit Ister in libro De proprietate certaminum.
   Quare nec castitas est bonum, nisi fiat propter delectionem Dei. Jam de
   iis, qui matrimonium abhorrent, dicit beatus Paulus: "In novissimis
   diebus deficient quidam a fide, attendentes spiritibus erroris, et
   doctrinis dæmoniorum, prohibentium nubere, abstinere a cibis." [2506]
   Et rursus dicit: "Nemo vos seducat in voluntaria humilitatis religione,
   et parcimonia corporis." [2507] Idem autem ilia quoque scribit:
   "Alligatus es uxori? ne quæras solutionem. Solutus es ab uxore? ne
   quæras uxorem." [2508] Et rursus: "Unusquisque autem suam uxorem
   habeat, ne tenter vos Satanas." [2509] Quid vero? non etiam justi
   veteres creaturam cum gratiarum actione participabant? Aliqui autem
   etiam liberos susceperunt, continenter versati in matrimonio. Et Eliæ
   quidem corvi alimentum afferebant, panes et carnes. Quinetiam Samuel
   propheta armum, quem ex iis, quæ comedisset, reliquerat, allatum, dedit
   edenalum Sauli. Hi autem, qui se cos dicunt vitæ institutis excellere,
   cum illorum actionibus ne poterunt quidem conferri. "Qui" itaque "non
   comedit, comedentem ne spernat. Qui autem comedit, eum qui non comedit
   non judicet: Deus enim ipsum accepit." [2510] Quin etiam Dominus de
   seipso dicens: "Venit," inquit, "Joannes, nec comedens, nec bibens, et
   dicunt: dæmonium habet; venit Filius hominis comedarts et bibens, et
   dicunt: Ecce homo vorax et vini potor, amicus publicanorum, et
   peccator." [2511] An etiam reprobant apostolos? Petrus enim et
   Philippu" [2512] filios procrearunt: Philippus autem filias quoque suas
   viris locavit. Et Paulus quidem certe non veretur in quadam epistola
   suam appellare "conjugem," quam non circumferebat, quod non magno ei
   esset opus ministerio. Dicit itaque in quadam epistola: "Non habemus
   potestatem sororem uxorem circumducendi, sicut et reliqui apostoli?"
   [2513] Sed hi quidem, ut erat consentaneum, ministerio, quod divelli
   non poterat, prædicationi scilicet, attendentes, non ut uxores, sed ut
   sorores circumducebant mulieres, quæ una ministraturæ essent apud
   mulieres quæ domos custodiebant: per quas etiam in gynæceum, absque
   ulla reprehensione malave suspicione, ingredi posset doctrina Domini.
   Scimus enim quæ cunque de feminis diaconis in altera ad Timotheum
   præstantissimus [2514] docet Paulus. Atqui hic ipse exclamavit: "Non
   est regnum Dei esca et potus:" neque vero abstinentia a vino et
   carnibus; "sed justitia, et pax, et gaudium in Spiritu sancto." [2515]
   Quis eorum, ovilla pelle indutus, zona pellicea accinctus, circuit ut
   Elias? Quis cilicium induit, cætera nudus, et discalceatus, ut Isaias?
   vel subligaculum tantum habet lineum, ut Jeremias? Joannis autem vitæ
   institutum gnosticum quis imitabitur? Sed sic quoque viventes, gratias
   Creatori agebant beati prophetic. Carpocratis autem justitia, et eorum,
   qui æque atque ipse impudicam prosequuntur communionem, hoc modo
   dissolvitur; simul enim ac dixerit: "Te petenti des;" subjungit: "Et
   eum, qui velit mutuo accipere, ne averseris;" [2516] hanc docens
   communionem, non autem illam incestam et impudicam.

   Quomodo autem fuerit is qui petit et accipit, et is qui mutuatur, si
   nullus sit qui habeat etdet mutuo? Quid vero? quando dicit Dominus:
   "Esurivi, et me pavistis; sitii, et potum mihi dedistis; hospes cram,
   et me collegistis; nudus, et me vestiistis;" [2517] deinde subjungit:
   "Quatenus fecistis uni horum minimorum, mihi fecistis." [2518] Nunquid
   easdem quoque tulit leges in Veteri Testamento? "Qui dat mendico,
   foeneratur Deo." [2519] Et: "Ne abstinueris a benefaciendo egeno,"
   [2520] inquit. Et rursus: "Eleemosynæ et fides ne te deficiant," [2521]
   inquit. "Paupertas" autem "virum humiliat, ditant autem manus virorum."
   [2522] Subjungit autem: "Qui pecuniam suam non dedit ad usuram, fit
   acceptus." Et: "Pretium redemptionis anima, propriæ judicantur
   divitiæ." [2523] Annon aperte indicat, quod sicut mundus componitur ex
   contrariis, nempe ex calido et frigido, humido et sicco, ita etiam ex
   iis qui dant, et ex iis qui accipiunt? Et rursus cum dixit: "Si vis
   perfectus esse, vende quæ habes, et da pauperibus," refellit eum qui
   gloriabatur quod "omnia a juventute præcepta servaverat;" non enim
   impleverat illud: "Diliges proximum tuum sicut teipsum:" [2524] tunc
   autem cum a Domino perficeretur, docebatur communicare et impertiri per
   charitatem. Honeste ergo non prohibuit esse divitem, sed esse divitem
   injuste et inexplebiliter. "Possessio (enim,) quæ cure iniquitate
   acceleratur, minor redditur." [2525] "Sunt (enim,) qui seminantes
   multiplicant, et qui colligentes minus habent." [2526] De quibus
   scripture est: "Dispersit, dedit pauperibus, justitia ejus manet in
   sæculum sæculi." [2527] Qui enim "seminal et plura colligit," is est,
   qui per terrenam et temporalem communicationem ac distributionem,
   coelestia acquirit et æterna. Est autem alius, qui nemini impertit, let
   incassum "thesauros in terra colligit, ubi ærugo et tinea destruunt."
   [2528] De quo scriptum est: "Qui colligit mercedes, colligit in saccum
   perforatum." [2529] Hujus "agrum" Dominus in Evangelio dicet "fuisse
   fertilem:" [2530] deinde cum vellet fructus reponere, et esset "majora
   horrea ædificaturus," sibi dixisse per prosopopoeiam: "Habes bona multa
   reposita tibi in multos annos, ede, bibe, lætare:" "Stulte ergo,
   inquit, hac nocte animam tuam ate repetunt; quæ ergo parasti, cujus
   erunt?"

      Caput VII.--Qua in Re Christianorum Continentia Eam Quam Sibi Vindicant
      Philosophi Antecellat.

   Humana ergo continentia, [2531] ea, inquam, quæ est ex sententia
   philosophorum Græcorum, profitetur pugnare cum cupiditate, et in factis
   ei non inservire; quæ est autem ex nostra sententia continentia, non
   concupiscere; non ut quis concupiscens se fortiter gerat, sed ut etiam
   a concupiscendo se contineat. Non potest autem ea aliter comparari
   continentia, nisi gratia Dei. Et ideo dixit: "Petite, et dabitur
   vobis." [2532] Hanc gratiam Moyses quoque accepit, qui indigo corpore
   erat indutus, ut quadraginta diebus neque esuriret, neque sitiret.
   Quemadmodum autem melius est sanum esse, quam ægrotantem disserere de
   sanitate: ita lucem esse, quam loqui de luce; et quæ est ex veritate
   continentia, ea quæ docetur a philosophis. Non enim ubi est lux, illic
   tenebræ: ubi autem sola insidet cupiditas, etiamsi quiescat a corporea
   operatione, at memoria cure eo, quod non est præsens, congreditur.
   Generatim autem nobis procedar oratio de matrimonio, nutrimento, et
   aliis, ut nihil faciamus ex cupiditate, velimus autem ea sola, quæ sunt
   necessaria. Non sumus enim filii cupiditatis, sed voluntatis; et eum,
   qui uxorem duxit propter liberorum procreationem, exercere oportet
   continentiam, ut ne suam quidem concupiscat uxorem, quam debet
   diligere, honesta et moderata voluntate operam dans liberis. Non enim
   "carnis curam gerere ad concupiscentias" didicimus; "honeste autem
   tanquam in die," Christo, et Dominica lucida vitæ institutione,
   "ambulantes, non in comessationibus et ebrietatibus, non in cubilibus
   et impudicitiis, non in litibus et contentionibus." [2533]
   Verumenimvero non oportet considerare continentiam in uno solum genere,
   nempe in rebus venereis, sed etiam in quibuscunque aliis, qua:
   luxuriosa concupiscit anima, non contenta necessariis, sed sollicita de
   deliciis. Continentia est pecuniam despicere; voluptatem, possessionem,
   spectaculum magno et excelso animo contemnere; os continere, ratione
   qua: sunt mala vincere. Jam vero angeli quoque quidam, cum fuissent
   incontinentes, victi cupiditate, huc e coelo deciderunt. Valentinus
   autem in Epistola ad Agathopodem: "Cum omnia, inquit, sustinuisset,
   erat continens, divinitatem sibi comparavit Jesus; edebat et bibebat
   peculiari modo, non reddens cibos; tanta ei inerat vis continentiæ, ut
   etiam nutrimentum in eo non interierit, quoniam ipse non habuit
   interitum." Nos ergo propter dilectionem in Dominum, et propter ipsum
   honestum, amplectimur continentiam, templum Spiritus sanctificantes.
   Honestum enim est, "propter regnum coelorum seipsum castrare" [2534] ab
   omni cupidirate, et "emundare conscientiam a mortuis operibus, ad
   serviendum Deo viventi." [2535] Qui autem propier odium adversus carnem
   susceptum a conjugali conjunctione, et eorum qui conveniunt ciborum
   participatione, liberari desiderant, indocti sunt et impii, et absque
   ratione continentes, sicut aliæ genres plurimæ. Brachmanes quidem certe
   neque animatum comedunt, neque vinum bibunt; sed aliqui quidera ex iis
   quotidie sicut nos cibum capiunt; nonnulli autem ex iis tertio quoque
   die, ut ait Alexander Polyhistor in Indicis; mortem autem contemnunt,
   et vivere nihili faciunt; credunt enim esse regenerationem: aliqui
   autem colunt Herculem et Pana. Qui autem ex Indis vocantur Semnoi, hoc
   est, venerandi, nudi totam vitam transigunt: ii veritatem exercent, et
   futura prædicunt, et colunt quamdam pyramidera, sub qua existimant
   alicujus dei ossa reposita. Neque vero Gymnosophistæ, nec qui dicuntur
   Semnoi, utuntur mulieribus, hoc enim præter naturam et iniquum esse
   existimant; qua de causa seipsos castos conservant. Virgines autem sunt
   etiam mulieres, qua: dicuntur Semnai, hoc est, venerandæ. Videntur
   autem observare coelestia, et per eorum significationem quæ dam futura
   prædicere.

      Caput VIII.--Loca S. Scripturæ Ab Hæreticis in Vituperium Matrimonii
      Adducta Explicat; Et Primo Verba Apostoli Romans 6:14, Ab Hæreticorum
      Perversa Interpretatione Vindicat. [2536]

   Quoniam autem qui introducunt indifferentiam, paucas quasdam Scripturas
   detorquentes, titillanti suæ voluptati eas suffragari existimant; rum
   præcipue illam quoque: "Peccatum enim vestri non dominabitur; non estis
   enim sub lege, sed sub gratia;" [2537] et aliquas alias hujusmodi,
   quarum posthæc non est rationi consentaneum ut faciam mentionem (non
   enim nayera instruo piraticam), age paucis eorum argumentum
   perfringamus. Ipse enim egregius Apostolus in verbis, quæ prædictæ
   dictioni subjungit, intentati criminis afferet solutionem: "Quid ergo?
   peccabimus, quiâ non sumus sub lege, sed sub gratia? Absit." [2538]
   Adeo divine et prophetice e vestigio dissolvit artem voluptatis
   sophisticam. Non intelligunt ergo, ut videtur, quod "omnes nos oportet
   manifestari ante tribunal Christi, ut referat unusquisque per corpus ea
   quæ fecit, sire bonum, sive malum:" [2539] ut quæ per corpus fecit
   aliquis, recipiat. "Quare si quis est in Christo, nova creatura est,"
   nec amplius peccatis dedita: "Vetera præterierunt," vitam antiquam
   exuimus: "Ecce enim nova facta sunt," [2540] castitas ex fornicatione,
   et continentia ex incontinentia, justitia ex injustitia. "Quæ est enim
   participatio justitiæ et injustitiæ? aut quæ luci cure tenebris
   societas? quæ est autem conventio Christo cum Belial? quæ pars est
   fideli cum infideli? quæ est autem consensio templo Dei cum idolis?
   [2541] Has ergo habentes promissiones, mundemus nos ipsos ab omni
   inquinamento carnis et spiritus, perficientes sanctitatem in timore
   Dei." [2542]

      Caput IX.--Dictum Christi ad Salomen Exponit, Quod Tanquam in Vituperium
      Nuptiarum Prolatum Hæretici Allegabant.

   Qui autem Dei creaturæ resistunt per speciosam illam continentiam, illa
   quoque dicunt, quæ ad Salomen dicta sunt, quorum prius meminimus:
   habentur autem, ut existimo, in Evangelio secundum Ægyptios. [2543]
   Aiunt enim ipsum dixisse Servatorem: "Veni ad dissolvendum opera
   feminæ;" feminæ quidem, cupiditatis; opera autem generationem et
   interitum. Quid ergo dixerint? Desiithæc administratio? Non dixerint:
   manet enim mundus in eadem ceconomia. Sed non falsum dixit Dominus;
   revera enim opera dissolvit cupiditatis, avaritiam, contentionem,
   gloriæ cupiditatem, mulierum insanum amorem, pædicatum, ingluviem,
   luxum et profusionem, et quæ sunt his similia. Horum autem ortus, est
   animæ interitus: siquidem "delictis mortui" efficimur. [2544] Ea vero
   femina est intemperantia. Ortum autem et interitum creaturarum propter
   ipsorum naturas fieri necesse est, usque ad perfectam distinctionem et
   restitutionem electionis, per quam, quæ etiam sunt mundo permistæ et
   confusæ substantiæ, proprietati suæ restituuntur. Unde merito cum de
   consummatione Logos locutus fuerat, ait Salome: "Quousque morientur
   homines?" Hominem autem vocat Scriptura dupliciter: et eum, qui
   apparet, et animam; et eum rursus, qui servatur, et eum qui non. Mors
   autem animæ dicitur peccatum. Quare caute et considerate respondet
   Dominus: "Quoadusque pepererint mulieres," hoc est quandiu operabuntur
   cupiditates. "Et ideo quemadmodum per unum hominem peccatum ingressum
   est in mundum, per peccaturn quoque mors ad omnes homines pervasit,
   quatenus omnes peccaverunt; et regnavit mors ab Adam usque ad Moysen,"
   [2545] inquit Apostolus: naturali autem divinæ ceconomiæ necessitate
   mors sequitur generationem: et corporis et animæ conjunctionem
   consequitur eorum dissolutio. Si est autem propter doctrinam et
   agnitionem generatio, restitutionis causa erit dissolutio. Quomodo
   autem existimatur mulier causa morris, propterea quod pariat: ita etiam
   dicetur dux vitæ propter eamdem causam. Proinde qua, prior inchoavit
   transgressionem, Vita est appellata, [2546] propter causam
   successionis: et eorum, qui generantur, et qui peccant, tam justorum
   quam injustorum, mater est, unoquoque nostrum, seipsum justificante,
   vel contra inobedientem constituente. Unde non ego quidem arbitror
   Apostolum abhorrere vitam, quæ est in came, cum dicit: "Sed in omni
   fiducia, ut semper, nunc quoque Christus magnificabitur in corpore meo,
   sire per vitam, sire per mortera. Mihi enim vivere Christus et mori
   lucrum. Si autem vivere in carne, et hoc quoque mihi fructus operis,
   quid eligam nescio, et coarctor ex duobus, cupiens resolvi, et esse cum
   Christo: multo enim melius: manere autem in carne, est magis
   necessarium propter vos." [2547] Per hæc enim, ut puto, aperte
   ostendit, exitus quidem e corpore perfectionem, esse in Dei
   dilectionem: ejus autem præ sentiæ in carne, ex grato animo profectam
   tolerantiam, propter eos, qui salute indigent. Quid vero? non etiam ea,
   quæ deinceps sequuntur, ex ils, quæ dicta sunt ad Salomen, subjungunt
   ii, qui quidvis potius quam quæ est ex veritate, evangelicam regulam
   sunt secuti? Cum ea enim dixisset: "Recteergo feci, quæ non peperi:"
   scilicet, quod generatio non esset ut oportet assumpta; excipit
   Dominus, dicens: "Omni herba vescere, ea autem, quæ habet amaritudinem,
   ne yescaris." Perhæc enim significat, esse in nostra potestate, et non
   esse necessarium ex prohibitione præcepti, vel continentiam, vel etiam
   matrimonium; et quod matrimonium creationi aliquid affert auxilii,
   præterea explicans. Ne quis ergo eum deliquisse existlimet, qui
   secundum Logon matrimonium inierit, nisi existimet amaram esse filiorum
   educationem: contra tamen, permultis videtur esse molestissimum liberis
   carere. Neque amara cuiquam videatur liberorum procreatio, eo quod
   negotiis implicatos a divinis abstrahat. Est enim, qui vitam solitariam
   facile ferre non valens, expetit matrimonium: quandoquidem res grata,
   qua quis temperanter fruitur, et innoxia: et unusquisque nostrum
   eatenus sui dominus est, ut eligat, an velit liberos procreate.
   Intelligo autem, quod aliqui quidem, qui prætextu matrimonii
   difficultatum ab eo abstinuerunt, non convenienter sanctæ cognitioni ad
   inhumanitatem et odium hominum defluxerunt; et petit apud ipsos
   charitas; alii autem matrimonio ligati, et luxui ac voluptatibus
   dediti, lege quodammodo eos comitante, fuerunt, ut ait Propheta,
   "assimilati jumentis." [2548]

      Caput X.--Verba Christi Matt. xviii. 20, Mystice Exponit. [2549]

   Quinam sunt autem illi "duo et tres, qui congregantur in nomine Domini,
   in" quorum "medio" est Dominus? [2550] annon virum et mulierem et
   filium tres dicit, quoniam mulier cum viro per Deum conjungitur? Quod
   si accinctus quis esse velit et expeditus, non volens procreate
   liberos, propter eam, quæ est in procreandis liberis, molestiam et
   occupationem, "maneat," inquit Apostolus, absque uxore "ut ego." [2551]
   Quiam vero effatum Domini exponunt, ac si dixisset, cure pluribus
   quidera esse Creatorem ac præ sidem generationis Deum; cum uno autem,
   nempe electo, Servatorem, qui alterius, boni scilicet, Dei Filius sit.
   Hoc autem non ira habet: sed est quidem etiam cure iis, qui honeste ac
   moderate in matrimonio versati sunt, et Iiberos susceperunt, Deus per
   Filium: est autem etiam cure eo, qui secundum Logon, seu rationem, fuit
   continens, idem Dens. Fuerint autem aliter quoque tres quidera, ira,
   cupiditas, et ratio: caro antera at anima et spiritus, alia ratione.
   Forte antera et vocationem et electionem secundam, et tertium genus,
   quod in primo honore collocatur, innuit trias prius dicta: cum quibus
   est, quæ omnia considerat, Dei potestas, absque divisione cadens in
   divisionem. Qui ergo animæ naturalibus, ita ut oportet, utitur
   operationibus, desiderat quidem ea, quæ sunt convenientia, odio autem
   habet ea, quæ lædunt, sicut jubent mandata: "Benedices" enim, inquit,
   "benedicenti, et maledices maledicenti." Quando autem his, ira scilicet
   et cupidirate, superior factus, et creaturæ amore vere affectus propter
   eum, qui est Deus et effector omnium, gnostice vitam instituerit, et
   Salvatori similis evadens, facilem temperantiæ habitum acquisiverit, et
   cognitionem, fidem, ac dilectionem conjunxerit, simplici hac in parte
   judicio utens, et vere spiritalis factus, nec earum quæ ex ira et
   cupiditate procedunt, cogitationum omnino capax, ad Domini imaginem ab
   ipso artifice efficitur homo perfectus, is sane dignus jam est, qui
   frater a Domino nominetur, is simul est amicus et filius. Sic ergo "duo
   et tres" in eodem "congregantur," nempe in homine gnosrico. Poterit
   etiam multorum quoque concordia ex tribus æstimata, cum quibus est
   Dominus, significare unam Ecclesiam, unum hominem, genus unum. Annon
   cum uno quidem Judæo erat Dominus, cum legera tulit: at prophetans, et
   Jeremiam mittens Babylonem, quinetiam cos qui erant ex gentibus vocans
   per prophetiam, congregavit duos populos: tertius autem est unus, qui
   ex duobus "creatur in riorum hominem, quo inambulat et inhabitat" in
   ipsa Ecclesia? Et lex simul et prophetæ, una cum Evangelio, in nomine
   Christi congregantur in unam cognitionem. Qui ergo propter odium uxorem
   non ducunt, vel propter concupiscentiam carne indifferenter abutuntur,
   non sunt in numero illorum qui servantur, cum quibus est Dominus.

      Caput XI.--Legis Et Christi Mandatum de Non Concupiscendo Exponit. [2552]

   His sic ostensis, age Scripturas, quæ adversantur sophistis hæreticis,
   jam adducamus, et regulam continentiæ secundum logon seu rationem
   observandam declaremus. Qui vero intelligit, quæ Scriptura cuique
   hæresi contraria sit, cam tempestive adhibendo refutabit eos, qui
   dogmata mandatis contraria fingunt. Atque ut ab alto rem repetamus, lex
   quidem, sicut prius diximus, illud, "Non concupisces uxorem proximi
   tui," [2553] prius exclamavit ante conjunctam Domini in Novo Testamento
   vocem, quæ dicit ex sua ipsius persona: "Audivistis legem præcipientem:
   Non moechaberis. Ego autem dico: Non concupisces." [2554] Quod enim
   vellet lex viros uti moderate uxoribus, et propter solam liberorum
   susceptionem, ex eo clarum est, quod prohibet quidem eum, qui non habet
   uxorem, statim cum" captiva" habere consuetudinem. [2555] Quod si semel
   desideraverit, ei, cum tonsa fuerit capillos, permittere ut lugeat
   triginta diebus. Si autem ne sic quidem emarcescat cupiditas, tunc
   liberis operam dare, cum quæ dominatur impulsio, probata sit præ finito
   tempore consentanea rationi appetitio. Unde nullum ex veteribus ex
   Scripturn ostenderis, qui cum prægnante rem habuerit: sed postquam
   gestavit uterum, et postquam editum fetum a lacte depulit, rursus a
   viris cognitas fuisse uxores. Jam hunc scopum et institutum invenies
   servantera Moysis patrem, cure triennium post Aaronem editum
   intermisisset, genuisse Moysem. Et rursus Levitica tribus, servans hanc
   naturæ legem a Deo traditam, aliis numero minor ingressa est in terram
   promissam. Non enim facile multiplicatur genus, cum viii quidera
   seminant, legitimo juncti matrimonio; exspectant autem non solum uteri
   gestationem, sed etiam a lacte depulsionem. Unde merito Moyses, quoque
   Judæos paulatim proveheris ad continentiam, cure "tribus diebus" [2556]
   deinceps consequentibus a venerea voluptate abstinuissent, jussit
   audire verba Dei. "Nosergo Dei templa sumus, sicut dixit propheta:
   Inhabitabo in eis, et inambulabo, et ero eorum Deus, et ipsi erunt meus
   populus," si ex præceptis vitam instituamus, sive singuli nostrum, sire
   tota simul Ecclesia. "Quareegredimini e medio ipsorum, et separamini,
   dicit Dominus, et immundum ne tangatis; et ego vos suscipiam, et ero
   vobis in patrem, et vos eritis mihi in filios et filias, dicit Dominus
   omnipotens." [2557] Non ab iis, qui uxores duxerunt, ut aiunt, sed a
   gentibus, quæ adhuc vivebant in fornicatione, præterea autem a prius
   quoque dictis hæresibus, ut immundis et impiis, prophetice nos jubet
   separari. Unde etiam Panlus quoque verba dirigens ad eos, qu ierant
   iis, qui dicti sunt, similes: "Has ergo promissiones habete, inquit,
   dilecti: mundemus corda nostra ab omni inquinamento carnis et spiritus,
   perficientes sanctitatem in timore Dei. [2558] Zelo enim vos zelo Dei;
   despondi enim vos uni viro, virginem castam exhibere Christo." [2559]
   Et Ecclesia quidem alii non jungitur matrimonio, cum sponsum hubeat:
   sed unusquisque nostrum habet potestatem ducendi, quamcunque velit,
   legitimam uxorem, in prim is, inquam, nuptiis. "Vereor autem, ne sicut
   serpens seduxit Evam in astutia, corrumpantur sensus vestri a
   simplicitate, quæ in Christo est," [2560] pie admodum et doctoris
   instar dixit Apostolus. Quocirca admirabilis quoque Petrus:
   "Charissimi, inquit, obsecro vos tanquam advernas et peregrinos,
   abstinete vos a carnalibus desideriis, quæ militant adversus animam,
   conversationem vestram inter gentes habentes bonam: quoniam sic est
   voluntas Dei, ut bene facientes obmutescere faciatis imprudentium
   hominum ignorantiam; quasi liberi, et non quasi velamen habentes
   malitiæ libertatem, sed ut servi Dei." [2561] Similiter etiam scribit
   Paulus in Epistola ad Romanos: "Quimortui sumus peccato, quomodo adhuc
   riveruns in ipso? Quoniam veins homo nosier simul est crucifixus, ut
   destruatur corpus peccati," [2562] usque ad illud: "Neque exhibete
   membra vestra, arma injustitiæ peccato." [2563] Atque adeo cure in hunc
   locum devenerim, videor mihi non esse prætermissurus, quirt notem, quod
   eumdem Deum per legem et prophetas et Evangelium prædicet Apostolus.
   Illud enim: "Non concupisces," quod scriptum est in Evangelio, legi
   attribuit in Epistola ad Romanos, sciens esse unum eum, qui prædicavit
   per legem et prophetas, Patrem, et qui per ipsum est annuntiatus. Dicit
   enim: "Quid dicemus? Lex estne peccatum? Absit. Sed peccatum non
   cognovi, nisi per legem. Concupiscentiam enim non cognovissem, nisi lex
   diceret: Non concupisces." [2564] Quod si ii, qui sunt diversæ
   sententiæ, repugnantes, existiment Paulum verba sua dirigentem adversus
   Creatorem, dixisse ea, quæ deinceps sequuntur: "Novi enim, quod non
   habitat in me, hoc est, in came mea, bonum;" [2565] legant æ, quæ prius
   dicta sunt; et ea, quæ consequuntur. Prius enim dixit: "Sed inhabitarts
   in me peccatum;" propter quod consentaneum erat dicere illud: "Non
   habitat in came mea bonum." [2566] Consequenter subjunxit: "Si autem
   quod nolo, hoc ego facio, non utique ego id operor, sed quod inhabitat
   in me peccatum:" quod "repugnans," inquit, "legi" Dei et "mentis meæ,
   captivat me in lege peccati, quæ est in membris meis. Miser ego homo,
   quis me liberabit de corpore morris hujus?" [2567] Et rursus (nunquam
   enim quovis modo juvando defatigatur) non veretur veluti concludere:
   "Lex enim spiritus liberavit me a lege peccati et morris:" quoniam "per
   Filium Dens condemnavit peccaturn in carne, ut justificatio legis
   impleatur in nobis, qui non secundum carnem ambulamus, seal secundum
   spiritum." [2568] Præterhæc adhuc declarans ea, qum prius dicta sunt,
   exclamat: "Corpus quidem mortunto propter peccatum:" significans id non
   esse templum, sed sepulcum animæ. Quando enim sanctificatum fuerit Deo,
   "Spiritus ejus," infert, "qui suscitavit Jesum a mortuis, habitat in
   vobis: qui vivificabit etiam mortalia vestra corpora, per ejus
   Spiritum, qui habitat in vobis." [2569] Rursus itaque voluptaxios
   increpans, illa adjicit: "Prudentia enim carnis, mors; quoniam qui ex
   came vivunt, ea, quæ sunt carnis, cogitant; et prudentia carnis est cum
   Deo gerere inimicitias; legi enim Dei non subjicitur. Qui autem sunt in
   carne," non ut quidam decemunt, "Deo placere non possunt," sed ut prius
   diximus. Deinde ut eos distinguat, dicit Ecclesiæ: "Vos autem non estis
   in carne sed in spiritu, si quidem spiritus Dei habitat in vobis. Si
   quis autem spiritum Christi non habet, is non est ejus. Si autem
   Christus in vobis, corpus quidem est mortuum per peccatum, spiritus
   autem vivus per justitiam. Debitores itaque sumus, fratres, non carni,
   ut secundum carnem vivamus. Si enim secundum camera vivitis, estis
   morituri: si vero spiritu facta carnis mortificaveritis, vivetis.
   Quicunque enim spiritu Dei aguntur, ii sunt filii Dei." Et adversus
   nobilitatem et adversus libertatem, qum exsecrabiliter ab iis, qui sunt
   diversæ sententiæ, introducitur, qui de libidine gloriantur, subjungit
   dicens: "Non enim accepistis spiritum servitutis rursus in timorein,
   sed accepistis spiritum adoptionis filiorum, in quo clamamus, Abba
   Pater;" [2570] hoc est, ad hoc accepimus, ut cognoscamus eum, quem
   oramus, qui est vere Pater, qui rerum omnium solus est Pater, qui ad
   salutem erudit et castigat at pater, et timorem minatur.

      Caput XII.--Verba Apostoli 1 Cor. vii. 5, 39, 40, Aliaque S. Scripturæ
      Loca Eodem Spectantia Explicat.

   Quod autem "ex consensu ad tempus orationi vacat" conjugium, doctrina
   est continentiæ. Adjecit enim illud quidem, "ex consensu," ne quis
   dissolveret matrimonium; "ad tempus autem," [2571] ne, dum ex
   necessitate exercet continentiam is, qui uxorem duxerit, labatur in
   peccatum, et dum suo conjugio parcit, alienum concupiscat. Qua ratione
   eum, qui se indecore getere existimat, quod virginem alat, recte cam
   dicit esse nuptum damrum. Verum unusquisque, tam is qui castitatem,
   delegit, quam is qui propter liberorum procreationem seipsum conjunxit
   matrimonio, in suo proposito firmiter debet perseverare, nec in
   deterius deflectere. Si enim vitæ suæ instimtum augere ac intendere
   porefit, majorem sibi apud Deum acquirit dignitatem, propter puram et
   ex ratione profectam continentiam. Si autem eam, quam elegit, regulam
   superaverit, in majorem deinde ad spem gloriam recidet. Habet enim
   sicut castitas, ira etiam matrimonium propria munera et ministeria, quæ
   ad Dominum pertinent, filiorum, inquam, curam gerere et uxoris. Quod
   enim honeste causatur is, qui est in matrimonio perfectus, est conjugii
   necessitudo, ut qui omnium curam ac providentiam in domo communi
   ostenderit. Ac proinde "episcopos," inquit, oportet constitui, qui ex
   domo propria toti quoque Ecclesiæ præ esse sint meditati. "Unusquisque"
   ergo, "in quo vocatus est" [2572] opere ministerium peragat, ut liber
   in Christo fiat, et debitam ministerio suo mercedem accipiat. Et rursus
   de lege disserens, utens allegoria: "Nam quæ sub viro est mulier,"
   inquit, "viventi viro alligata est lege," [2573] et quæ sequuntur. Et
   rursus: "Mulletest alligata, quandiu vivit vir ejus; sin autem mortuus
   fuerit, libera est ut nubat, modo in Domino. Beata est autem si sic
   permanserit, mea quidem sententia." [2574] Sed in priore quidem
   particula, "mortificati estis," inquit, "legi," non matrimonio, "ut
   efficiamini vos alteri, qui excitatus est ex mortuis," [2575] sponsa et
   Ecclesia; quam castam esse oportet, et ab iis quæ strut intus,
   cogitationibus, quæ sunt contrariæ veritati; et ab iis, qui tentant
   extrinsecus, hoc est ab iis, qui sectantur hæreses, et persuadent vobis
   fornicari ab uno viro, nempe omnipotenti Deo: "Ne sicut setpens decepit
   Evam," [2576] quæ "vita" dicitur, nos quoque inducti callidis hæresium
   illecebris, transgrediamur mandata. Secunda autem particula statuit
   monogamiam: non enim, ut quidam existimarunt, mulieris cum viro
   alligationem, carnis cum corruptela connexionem, significari putandum
   est; impiorum enim hominum, qui matrimonii inventionem diabolo aperte
   tribuunt, opinionera reprehendit, unde in periculum venit legislator ne
   incessatur maledictis. Tatianum arbitror Syrum talia audere dogmata
   tradere. [2577] His verbis quidem certe scribit in libro De perfectione
   secundum Servatorem: Consensum quidem conjungit orationi: communio
   autem corruptelæ, interitus solvit interpellationem. Admodum certe
   circumspecte arcet per concessionem. Nam cum rursus permisit "simul
   convernire propter Satanam et intemperantiam," [2578] pronuntiavit eum,
   qui est obtemperaturus, "serviturum duobus dominis:" [2579] per
   consensure quidem, Deo; per dissensionem autem, intemperantiæ et
   fornicationi et diabolo. Hæc autem dicit, Apostolum exponens.
   Sophistice autem eludit veritatem, per verum, falsum confirmans:
   intemperantiam enim et fornicationem, diabolica vitia et affectiones
   nos quoque confitemur; intercedit autem moderati matrimonii consensio,
   quæ tum ad precationem continenter deducit, tum ad procreandos liberos
   cum honestate conciliat. "Cognitio" quidem certe a Scriptura dictum est
   tempus liberorum procreationis, cum dixit: "Cognovit autem Adam Evam
   uxorem suam; et concepit, et peperit filium, et nominavit nomen ejus
   Seth: Suscitavit enim mihi Deus aliud semen pro Abel." [2580] Vides,
   quemnam maledictis incessant, qui honestam ac moderatam incessunt
   seminationem, et diabolo attribuunt generationem. Non enim simpliciter
   Deum dixit, qui articuli præ missione, nempe ho Theos dicens,
   significavit eum, qui est omnipotens. Quod ab Apostolo autem
   subjungitur: "Etrursus simul convenite propter Satanam," [2581] in eum
   finera dicitur, ut occasionem tollat ad alias declinandi cupiditates.
   Non enim penitus repellit naturæ appetitiones, qui fit ad tempus,
   consensus: per quem rursus inducit Apostolus conjugationera matrimonii,
   non ad intemperantiam et fornicationem et opus diaboli, sed ne
   subjugetur intemperantiæ, fornicationi, et diabolo. Distinguit autem
   veterem quoque hominem et novum Tatianus, sed non ut dicimus, "Veterem"
   quidem "virum," legem; "novum" autem, Evangelium. Assentimur ei nos
   quoque, sed non eo modo, quo vult ille, dissolvens legem ut alterius
   Dei: sed idem vir et Dominus, dum vetera renovat, non amplius concedit
   polygamiam (nam hanc quidem expetebat Deus, quando oportebat homines
   augeri et multiplicari), sed monogamiam introducit prompter liberorum
   procreationem et domus curam, ad quam data est mulier adjutrix: et si
   cui Apostolus propter intemperantiam et ustionem, veniam secundi
   concedit matrimonii; nam hic quoque non peccat quidem ex Testamento
   (non est enim a lege prohibitus), non implet autem summam illam vitæ
   perfectionem, quæ agitur ex Evangelio. Gloriam autem sibi acquirit
   coelestem, qui apud se manserit, earn, quæ est morte dissoluta,
   impollutam servans conjunctionem, et grato ac lubente animo paret
   ceconomiæ, per quam effectum est, ut divelli non possit a Domini
   ministerio. Sed nec eum, qui ex conjugali surgit cubili, similiter ut
   olim, tingi nunc quoque jubet divina per Dominum providentia: non enim
   necessario a liberorum abducit procreatione, qui credentes per unum
   baptismum ad consuetudinem omni ex parte perfectam abluit, Dominus, qui
   etiam multa Moysis baptismata per unum comprehendit baptismum. Proinde
   lex, ut per carnalem generationem nostram præ diceret regenerationera,
   genitali seminis facultati baptismum olim adhibuit, non vero quod ab
   hominis generatione abhorreret. Quod enim apparet homo generatus, hoc
   valet seminis dejectio. Non sunt ergo multi coitus genitales, sed
   matricis susceptio fatetur generationem, cum in naturæ officina semen
   formatur in fetum. Quomodo autem vetus quidera est solum matrimonium et
   legis inventum, alienum autem est, quod est ex Domino, matrimonium, cum
   idem Deus servetur a nobis? "Non" enim "quod Deus conjunxit, homo" jure
   "dissolverit;" [2582] multo autem magis quæ jussit Pater, servabit
   quoque Filius. Si autem idem simul est et legislator et evangelista,
   nunquam ipse secum pugnat. Vivit enim lex, cum sit spiritalis, et
   gnostice intelligatur: nos autem "mortui" sumus "legi per corpus
   Christi, ut gigneremur alteri, qui resurrrexit ex mortuis," qui
   prædictus fuit a lege, "ut Deo fructificaremus." [2583] Quare "lex
   quidera est sancta, et mandatum sanctum, et justurn, et bonum." [2584]
   Mortui ergo sumus legi, hoc est, peccato, quod a lege significatur,
   quod ostendit, non autem generat lex, per jussionem eorum quæ sunt
   facienda, et prohibitionera eorum quæ non facienda; reprehendens
   subjectum peccatum, "ut appareat peccatum." Si autem peccatum est
   matrimonium, quod secundum legera initur, nescio quomodo quis dicet se
   Deum nosse, dicens Dei jussum esse peccatum. Quod si "lex saneta" est,
   sanctum est matrimonium. Mysterium ergo hoc ad Christum et Ecclesiam
   ducit Apostolus: quemadmodum "quod ex carne generatur, caro est; ita
   quod ex spiritu, spiritus," [2585] non solum in pariendo, sed etiam in
   discendo. Jam "sancti sunt filii," [2586] Deo gratæ oblectationes
   verborum Dominicorum, quæ desponderunt animam. Sunt ergo separata
   fornicatio et matrimonium, quoniam a Deo longe abest diabolus. "Et vos
   ergo mortui estis legi per corpus Christi, ut vos gigneremini alteri,
   qui surrexit a mortuis." [2587] Simul autem proxime exauditur, si
   fueritis obedientes quamdoquidem etiam ex veritate legis eidem Domino
   obedimus, qui præcipit eminus. Nunquid autem de ejusmodi hominibus
   merito aperte "dicit Spiritus, quod in posterioribus temporibus
   deficient quidam a fide, attendentes spiritibus erroris, et doctrinis
   dæmoniorum, in hypocrisi falsiloquorum, cauteriatam habentium
   conscientiam, et prohibentium nubere, abstinere a cibis quos Deus
   creavit ad participationem cum gratiarum actione fidelibus, et qui
   agnoverunt veritatem, quod omnis creatura Dei bona est, et nihil est
   rejiciendum quod sumitur cure gratiarum actione. Sanctificatur enim per
   verburn Dei et orationem?" [2588] Omnino igitur non est prohibendum
   jungi matrimonio, neque carnibus vesci, aut vinum bibere. Scriptum est
   enim: "Bonum est carnero non coinedere, nec vinum bibere, si quis
   comedat per offendiculum." [2589] Et: "Bonum est manere sicut ego."
   [2590] Sed et qui utitur, "cum gratiarum actione," [2591] et qui rursus
   non utitur, ipse quoque "cure gratiarum actione," et cure moderata ac
   temperanti vivat perceptione, logo seu rationi convenienter. Et, ut in
   summa dicam, omnes Apostoli epistolæ, quæ moderationem docent et
   continentiam, cum et de matrimonio, et de liberorum procreatione, et de
   domus administratione innumerabilia præcepta contineant, nusquam
   honesrum moderatumque matrimonium prohibuerunt aut abrogarunt: sed
   legis cum Evangelio servantes convenientiam, utrumque admittunt: et
   eum, qui deo agendo gratias, moderate utitur matrimonio; et eum, qui,
   ut vult Dominus, vivit in castitate, quemadmodum "vocatus est
   unusquisque" inoffense et perfecte eligens. "Et erat tetra Jacob laudam
   supra omnem terram," [2592] inquit propheta, ipse vas spiritus gloria
   afficiens. Insectatur autem aliquis generationera, in earn dicens
   interitum cadere, eamque perire: et detorquet aliquis ad filiorum
   procreationem illud dictum Servatoris: "Non oportere in terra thesauros
   recondere, ubi tinea et ærugo demolitur;" [2593] nec erubescit his
   addere ea, quæ dicit propheta: "Omnes vos sicut vestimentum
   veterascetis, et tinea vos exedet." [2594] Sed neque nos contradicimus
   Scripturæ, neque in nostra corpora cadere interitum, eaque esse fluxa,
   negamus. Fortasse autem iis, quos ibi alloquitur propheta, ut
   peccatoribus, pnedicit interitum. Servator autem de liberorum
   procreatione nil dixit, sed ad impertiendum ac communicandum cos
   hortatur, qui solum opibus abundare, egentibus autem nolebant opem
   ferre. Quamobrem dicit: "Operamini non cibum, qui petit; sed eum, qui
   manet in vitam ætenam." [2595] Similiter autem afferunt etiam illud
   dictum de resurrectione mortuorum: "Filiillius sæculi nec nubunt, nec
   nubuntur." [2596] Sed hanc interrogationera et cos qui interrogant, si
   quis consideraverit, inveniet Dominum non reprobare matrimonium, sed
   remedium afferre exspectationi carnalis cupiditatis in resurrectione.
   Illud autem, "filiis hujus sæculi," [2597] non dixit ad distinctionera
   alicujus alius sacculi, sed perinde ac si diceret: Qui in hoc nati sunt
   sæculo, cum per generationera sint filii, et gighunt et gignuntur;
   quoniam non absque generatione hanc quis vitam prætergreditur: sedhæc
   generario, quæ similem suscipit interitum, non amplius competit ei qui
   ab hac vita est separatus. "Unus est ergo Pater noster, qui est in
   coelis:" [2598] sed is ipse quoque Pater est omnium per creationera.
   "Ne vocaveritis ergo, inquit, vobis patrein super terrain." [2599]
   Quasi diceret: Ne existimetis eum, qui carnali vos sevit satu, auctorem
   et causam vestræ essential, sed adjuvantem causam generationis, vel
   ministrum potius. Sic ergo nos rursus conversos vult effici ut pueros,
   eum, qui vere Pater est, agnoscentes, regeneratos per aquam, cure hæc
   sit alia satio in creatione. At, inquit, "Qui est cælebs, curat quæ
   sunt Domini; qui autem duxit uxorem, quomodo placebit uxori." Quid
   vero? annon licet etiam eis, qui secundum Deum placent uxori, Deo
   gratias agere? Annon permittitur etiam el, qui uxorem duxit, una cam
   conjugio etiam esse sollicitum de iis quæ sunt Domini? Sed quemadmodum
   "quæ non nupsit, sollicita est de iis, quæ sunt Domini, ut sit sancta
   corpore et spiritu:" [2600] ita etiam quæ nupsit, et de iis, quæ sunt
   mariti, et de iis, quæ sunt Domini, est in Domino sollicita, ut sit
   sancta et corpore et spiritu. Ambæ enim sant sanctæ in Domino: hæc
   quidem ut uxor, ilia vero ut virgo. Ad eos autem pudore afficiendos et
   reprimendos, qui sunt proclives ad secundas nuptias, apte Apostolus
   alto quodam tono eloquitur; inquit enim: "Ecce, omne peccatum est extra
   corpus; qui autem fornicatur, in proprium corpus peccat." [2601] Si
   quis autem matrimonium audet dicere fornicationem, rursus, legem et
   Dominum insectans, maledictis impetit. Quemadmodum enim avaritia et
   plura habendi cupiditas dicitur fornicatio, ut quæ adversetur
   sufficientiæ: et ut idololatria est ab uno in multos Dei distributio,
   ita fornicatio est ab uno matrimonio ad plura prolapsio. Tribus enim
   modis, ut diximus, fornicatio et adulterium sumifur apud Apostolum. De
   his dicit propheta: "Peccatis vestris venundati estis." Et rursus:
   "Pollutus es in terra aliena:" [2602] conjunctionera sceleratam
   existimans, quæ cum alieno corpore facta est, et non cure eo, quod
   datur in conjugio, ad liberorum procreationem. Unde etiam Apostolus:
   "Volo, inquit, juniores nubere, filios procreare, domui præ esse,
   nullam dare occasionem adversario maledicti gratia. Jam enim quæ dam
   diverterunt post Satanam." [2603] Quin et unius quoque uxoris virum
   utique admittit; seu sit presbyter, seu diaconus, seu laicus, utens
   matrimonio citra reprehensionem: "Servabitur autem per filiorum
   procreationem." [2604] Et rursus Servatot dicens Judæos "generationem
   pravam et adulteram," docet cos legem non cognovisse, ut lex vult: "sed
   seniorum traditionem, et hominum præcepta sequentes," adulterate legem,
   perinde ac si non esset data vir et dominus eorum virginitatis.
   Fortasse autem eos quoque innuit esse alienis mancipatos cupiditatibus,
   propter quas assidue quoque servientes peccatis, vendebantur
   alienigenis. Nam apud Judæos non erant admissæ communes mulieres: verum
   prohibitum erat adulterinm. Qui autem dicit: "Uxorem duxi, non possum
   venire," [2605] ad divinam coenam, est quidera exemplum ab eos
   arguendos, qui propter voluptates abscedunt a divino mandato: alioquin
   nec qui justi fuere ante adventum, nec qui post adventum uxores
   duxerunt, servabuntur, etiamsi sint apostoli. Quod si illud attulerint,
   quod propheta quoque dicit: "Inveteravi inter omnes inimicos meos,"
   [2606] per inimicos peccata intelligant. Unum quoddam autem est
   peccatum, non matrimonium, sed fornicatio: alioqui generationem quoque
   dicunt peccaturn, et creatorera generationis.

      Caput XIII.--Julii Cassiani Hæretici Verbis Respondet; Item Loco Quem Ex
      Evangelio Apocrypho Idem Adduxerat.

   Talibus argumentis utitur quoque Julius Cassianus, [2607] qui fixit
   princeps sectæ Docetarum. Inopere ceete De continentia, vel De
   castitate, his verbis dicit: "Nec dicat aliquis, quod quoniam talia
   habemus membra, ut aliter figurata sit femina, aliter vero masculus:
   illa quidera ad suscipiendum, hic vero ad seminandum, concessam esse a
   Deo consuetudinem. Si enim a Deo, ad quem tendimus, essethæc
   constitutio, non beatos dixisset esse eunuchos; neque propheta
   dixisset, eos non esse arborem infrugiferam; [2608] transferens ab
   arbore ad hominem, qui sua sponte et ex instituto se castrat tall
   cogitatione." Et pro impia opinione adhuc decertans, subjungit:
   "Quomodo autem non jure quis reprehenderit Servatorem, si nos
   transformavit, et ab errore liberavit, eta conjunctione membrorum, et
   additamentorum, et pudendomm?" in hoc eadem decernens cure Tatiano: hic
   autem prodiit ex schola Valentini. Propterea dicit Cassianus: "Cure
   interrogaret Salome, quando cognoscentur, ea, de quibus interrogabat,
   ait Dominus: Quando pudoris indumentum conculcaveritis, et quando duo
   facta fuerint unum, et masculum cure femina, nec masculum nec
   femineum." Primum quidera, in nobis traditis quatuor Evangeliis non
   habemus hoc dictum, sed in eo, quod est secundum Ægyptios. Deinde mihi
   videtur ignorare, iram quidera, masculam appetitionem; feminam vero,
   significare cupiditatem: quorum operationera poenitentia et pudor
   consequuntur. Cure quis ergo neque iræneque cupiditati obsequens, quæ
   quidera et consuetudine et mala educatione auctæ, obumbrant et
   contegunt rationem, sed quæ ex iis proficiscitur exuens caliginem, et
   pudore affectus ex poenitentia, spiritum animam unierit in obedientia
   Logi seu rationis; tunc, ut ait Paulus, "non inest in nobis nec
   masculus, nec femina." Recedens enim anima ab ea figura, qua
   discernitur masculus et femina, traducitur ad unionem, cum ea nutrum
   sit. Existimat autem hic vir præ clarus plus, quam par sit, Platonice,
   animain, cure sit ab initio divina, cupidirate effeminatam, huc venire
   ad generationem et interitum.

      Caput XIV.--2 Cor. xi. 3, Et Eph. iv. 24, Exponit.

   Jam vero vel invitum cogit Paulam generationem ex deceptione deducere,
   cure dicit: "Vereor autem, ne sicut serpens Evam decepit, corrupti sint
   sensus vestri a simplicitate, quæ est in Christo." [2609] Seal certum
   est, Dominum quoque "venisse" ad ea, "quæ aberraverant." [2610]
   Aberraverunt autem, non ab alto repetita origine in eam, quæ hic est,
   generationem (est enim generatio creatura Omnipotentis, qui nunquam ex
   melioribus ad deteriora deduxerit animam); sed ad eos, qui sensibus seu
   cogitationibus aberraverant, ad nos, inquam, venit Servator: qui quidem
   ex nostra in præceptis inobedientia corrupti sunt, dum nimis avide
   voluptatem persequeremur; cum utique protoplastus noster ternpus
   prævenisset, et ante debitum tempus matrimonii gratiam appetiisset et
   aberrasset: quoniam "quicunque aspicit mulierem ad concupiscendum eam,
   jam moechatus est eam" [2611] ut qui voluntatis tempus non
   exspectaverit. Is ipse ergo erat Dominus, qui tunc quoque damnabat
   cupiditatem, quæ prævenit matrimonium. Cum ergo dicit Apostolus:
   "Induite novum hominem, qui secundum Deum creatur," [2612] nobis dicit,
   qui ab Omnipotentis voluntate efficti sumus, sicut sumus efficti.
   "Veterem" autem dixit, non rescipiens ad generationem et
   regenerationem, sed ad vitam inobedientiæ et obedienti regeneraæ.
   "Pelliceas" autem "tunicas" [2613] existimat Cassianus esse corpora: in
   quo postea et eum, et qui idem cum eo sentiunt, aberrasse ostendemus,
   cure de ortu hominis, iis consequenter, quæ prius dicenda sunt,
   aggrediemur expositionem. "Quoniam, inquit, qui a terrenis reguntur, et
   generant, et generantur: Nostra autem conversatio est in coelo, ex quo
   etiam Salvatorem exspectamus." [2614] Recte ergo nos hæ quoque dicta
   esse scimus, quoniam ut hospites et advencta essæ peregrinantes debemus
   vitam instituere; qui uxorem habent, ut non habentes; qui possident, ut
   non possidentes; qui liberos procreant, ut mortales gignentes, ut
   relicturi possessiones, ut etiam sine uxore victuri, si opus sit; non
   cum immodico actione, et animo excelso.

      Caput XV.--1 Cor. vii. 1; Luc. xiv. 26; Isa. lvi. 2, 3, Explicat.

   Et rursus cure dicit: "Bonum est homini uxorem non tangere, sed propter
   fornicationes unusquisque suam uxorem habeat;" [2615] id veluti
   exponens, rursus dicit: "Ne vos tentet Satanas." [2616] Non enim iis,
   qui continenter utuntur matrimonio propter solam liberorum
   procreationem, dicit, "propter intemperantiam;" sed iis, qui finem
   liberorum procreationis cupiunt transilire: ne, cure nimium annuerit
   noster adversarius, excitet appetitionem ad alienas voluptates.
   Fortasse autem quoniam iis, qui juste vivunt, resistit propter
   æmulationem, et adversus eos contendit, volens eos ad suos ordines
   traducere, per laboriosam continentiam eis vult præbere occasionera.
   Merito ergo dicit: "Melius est matrimonio jungi quam uri," [2617] ut
   "vir reddat debiturn uxori, et uxor viro, et ne frustrentur invicem"
   [2618] hoc divino ad generationera dato auxilio. "Qui autem, inquiunt,
   non oderit patrem, vel matrem, vel uxorem, vel filios, non potest meus
   esse discipulus." [2619] Non jubet odisse proprium genus: "Honora"
   enim, inquit, "patrein et matrein, ut tibi bene sit:" [2620] sed ne
   abducaris, inquit, per appetitiones a ratione alienas, sed neque
   civilibus moribus conformis fias. Domus enim constat ex genere,
   civitates autem ex domibus; quemadmodum Paulus quoque eos, qui
   occupantur in matrimonio, "mundo dixit placere." [2621] Rursus dicit
   Dominus: "Qui uxorem duxit, ne expellat; et qui non duxit, ne ducat;"
   [2622] qui ex proposito castitatis professus est uxorem non ducere
   maneat cælebs. Utrisque ergo idem Dominus per prophetam Isaiam
   convenientes dat promissiones sic dicens: "Ne dicat eunuchus: Sum
   lignum aridum;" hæc enim dicit Dominus eunuchis: "Si custodieritis
   sabbata mea, et feceritis quæ cunque pruodæcipio, dabo vobis locum
   meliorem filiis et filiabus." [2623] Non sola enim justificat castitas,
   sed nec sabbatum eunuchi, nisi fecerit mandata. Infert autem iis, qui
   uxoremduxerunt, et dicit: "Electi mei non laborabunt in vanum, neque
   procreabunt filios in exsecrationem, quiâ semen est benedictum a
   Domino." [2624] Ei enim, qui secundum Logon filios procreavit et
   educavit, et erudivit in Domino, sicut etiam ei, qui genuit per veram
   catechesim et institutionem, merces quædam est proposita, sicut etiam
   electo semini. Alii autem "exsecrationem" accipiunt esse ipsam
   liberorum procreationem, et non intelligunt adversus illos ipsos ea
   dicere Scripturam. Qui enim sunt revera electi Domini, non dogmata
   decernunt, nec filios progignunt, qui sunt ad exsecrationem, et
   hæreses. Eunuchus ergo, non qui per vim excisas habet partes, sed nec
   qui cælebs est, dictus est, sed qui non gignit veritatem. Lignum hic
   prius erat aridum; si autem Logo obedierit, et sabbata custodieri, per
   abstinentiam a peccatis, et fecerit mandata erit honorabilior iis, qui
   absque recta vitæ institutione solo sermone erudiuntur. "Filioli,
   modicum" adhuc sum vobiscum," [2625] inquit Magister. Quare Paulus
   quoque scribens ad Galatas, dicit: "Filioli mei, quos iterum parturio,
   donec formetur in vobis Christus." [2626] Rursus ad Corinthios
   scribens: "Si enim decies mille pædagogos," inquit, "habeatis in
   Christo, sed non multos patres. In Christo enim per Evangelium ego
   vosgenui." [2627] Propterea "non ingrediatur eunuchus in Ecclesiam
   Dei," [2628] qui est sterilis, et non fert fructum, nec vitro
   institutione, nec sermone. Sed "qui se" quidem "castrarunt" ab omni
   peccato "propter regnum coelorum," [2629] ii sunt beati, qui a mundo
   jejunant.

      Caput XVI.--Jer. xx. 14; Job xiv. 3; Ps. l. 5; 1 Cor. ix. 27, Exponit.

   "Exsecranda" autem "dies in qua natus sum, et ut non sit optanda,"
   [2630] inquit Jeremias: non absolute exsecrandam dicens generationem,
   sed populi peccata ægre ferens et inobedientiam. Subjungit itaque: "Cur
   enim natus sum ut viderem labores et dolores, et in perpetuo probro
   fuerunt dies mei?" [2631] Quin etiam omnes, qui prædicabant veritatem,
   propier eorum, qui audiebant, inobedientiam, quæ rebantur ad poenam, et
   veniebant in periculum. "Cur enim non fuit uterus matris meæ sepulcrum,
   ne viderem affiictionem Jacob et laborera generis Isræl?" [2632] ait
   Esdras propheta. "Nullus est a sorde mundus," ait Job, "nee si sit
   quidera una dies vita ejus." [2633] Dicant ergo nobis, ubi fornicatus
   est infans natus? vel quomodo sub Adæcecidit exsecrationem, qui nihil
   est operatus? Restat ergo eis, ut videtur, consequenter, ut dicant
   malam esse generationem, non solum corporis, sed etiam animæ, per quam
   exsistit corpus. Et quando dixit David: "In peccatis conceptus sum, et
   in iniquitatibus concepit me mater mea:" [2634] dicit prophetice quidem
   matrem Evam; sed Eva quidem fuit "mater viventium;" et si is "in
   peccatis fuit conceptus," at non ipse in peccato, neque vero ipse
   peccatum. Utrum vero quicunque etiam a peccato ad fidem convertitur, a
   peccandi consuetudine tanquam a "matre" converti dicatur ad "vitam,"
   feret mihi testimonium unus ex duodecim prophetis, qui dixit: "Si
   dedero primogenita pro impietate fructum yeniris mei, pro peccatis
   animæ meæ." [2635] Non accusat eum, qui dixit: "Crescite et
   multiplicamini:" [2636] sed primos post generationera motus, quorum
   tempore Deum non cognoscimus, dicit "impietates." Si quis autem ea
   ratione dicit malam generationem, idem eam dicat bonam, quatenus in
   ipso veritatem cognoscimus. "Abluamini juste, et ne peccetis.
   Ignorationem enim Dei quidam habent," [2637] videlicet qui peccant.
   "Quoniam nobis est colluctatio non adversus camem et sanguinere, sed
   adversus spiritalia." [2638] Potentes autem sunt ad tentandum
   "principes tenebrarum hujus mundi," et ideo datur venia. Et ideo Paulus
   quoque: "Corpus meum," inquit, "castigo, et in servitutem redigo;
   quoniam qui certat, omnia continet," hoc est, in omnibus continet, non
   ab omnibus abstinens, sed continenter utens iis, quæ utenda judicavit,
   "illi quidera ut corruptibilem coronam accipiant; nos autem ut
   incorruptibilem," [2639] in lucta vincentes, non autem sine pulvere
   coronam accipientes. Jam nonnulli quoque præferunt viduam virgini, ut
   qua, quam experta est, voluptatem magno animo contempserit.

      Caput XVII.--Qui Nuptias Et Generationem Malas Asserunt, II Et Dei
      Creationem Et Ipsam Evangelii Dispensationem Vituperant.

   Sin autem malum est generatio, in malo blasphemi dicant fuisse Dominum
   qui fuit particeps generationis, in malo Virginera quæ genuit. Hei
   mihi! quot et quanta mala! Dei voluntatera maledictis incessunt, et
   mysterium creationis, dum invehuntur in generationera. Et hinc
   "Docesin" fingit Cassianus; hinc etiam Marcioni, et Valentino quoque
   est corpus animale; quoniam homo, inquiunt, operam dans veneri,
   "assimilatus est jumentis." [2640] Atqui profecto, cum libidine vere
   insaniens, aliena inire voluerit, tunc revera, qui talis est,
   efferatur: "Equi in feminas furentes facti sunt, unusquisque hinniebat
   ad uxorem proximi sui." [2641] Quod si dicat serpentera, a brutis
   animantibus accepta consilii sui ratione, Adamo persuasisse ut cum Eva
   coire consentiret, tanquam alioqui, ut quidam existimant, protoplasti
   hac natura usuri non fuissent: rursus vituperatur creatio, ut quæ
   rationis expertium animantium natura homines fecerit imbecilliores,
   quorum exempla consecuti sunt, qui a Deo primi formati fuere. Sin autem
   natura quidem eos sicut bruta deduxit ad filiorum procreationem; moti
   autem sunt citius quam oportuit, fraude inducti, cura adhuc essent
   juvenes; justum quidera est Dei judicium in eos qui non exspectarunt
   ejus voluntatera: sancta est autem generatio, per quam mundus
   consistit, per quam essentiæ, per quara naturæ, per quam angeli, per
   quam potestates, per quam animæ, per quam præcepta, per quam lex, per
   quam Evangelium, per quam Dei cognitio. "Et omnis caro fenum, et omnis
   gloria ejus quasi flos feni; et fenum quidem exsiccatur, flos autem
   decidit, sed verbum Domini manet," [2642] quod unxit artimam et uniit
   spiritui. Quomodo autem, qure est in Ecclesia nostra, [2643] oeconomia
   ad finem perduci potuisset absque corpore, cum etiam ipse, qui est
   caput Ecclesire, in came quidem informis et specie carens vitam
   transiit, ut doceret nos respicere ad naturam divinæ causespicere ad
   naturam divinnsiit, æinformem et incorpoream? "Arbor enim vitæ," inquit
   prophem, "est in bono desiderio," [2644] docens bona et munda
   desideria, quæ sunt in Domino vivente. Jam vero volunt viri cure uxore
   in matrimonio consuetudinem, quæ dicta est "cognitio," esse peccatum:
   eam quippe indicari ex esu "ligni boni et mali," [2645] per
   significationem hujus vocabuli "cognovit," [2646] quæ mandati
   tmnsgressionem notat. Si autem hoc im est, veritatis quoque cognitio,
   est esus ligni vitre. Potest ergo honestum ac moderatum matrimonium
   illius quoque ligni esse particeps. Nobis autem prius dictum est, quod
   licet bene et male uti matrimonio; et hoc est lignum "cognitionis," si
   non transgrediamur leges matrimonii. Quid vero? annon Servator noster,
   sicut animam, ita etiam corpus cumvit ab affectionibus? Neque vero si
   esset caro inimica animæ, inimicam per sanitatis restitutionem advenus
   ipsam muniisset. "Hoc autem dico, fratres, quod caro et sangnis regnum
   Dei non possunt possidere, neque corruptio possidet incorruptionem."
   [2647] Peccatun enim, cure sit "corruptio," non potest babere
   societatem cure incorruptione," quæ est justitia. "Adeo stulti,"
   inquit, "estis? cure spiritu coeperitis, nunc came consummamini."

      Caput XVIII.--Duas Extremas Opiniones Esse Vitandas: Primam Illorum Qui
      Creatoris Odio a Nuptiis Abstinent; Alteram Illorum Qui Hinc Occasionem
      Arripiunt Nefariis Libidinibus Indulgendi.

   Justitiam ergo et salutis harmoniam, quæ est veneranda firmaque, alii

   castitatem, qu secundum sanam regulam instituitur, eligere; gratias
   quidem agendo propter datam ipsis gratiam, non habendo antem odio

   creatus mundus, cream est etiam castitas; ambo autem agant gratias in
   iis, in quibus sunt collocati, si modo ea quoque norunt, in quibus sunt
   collocati. Alii autem effrenati se petulanter et insolenter gesserunt,
   revem "effecti equi in feminas insanientes, et ad proximorum suorum
   uxores hinnientes;" [2649] ut quiet ipsi contineri non possint, et
   proximis suis persuadeant ut dent operam voluptati;" infeliciter illas
   audientes Scriptums: "Quæ tibi obtigit, partem pone nobiscum, crumenam
   autem unam possideamus communem, et unum fiat nobis marsupium." [2650]
   Propter eos idem propheta dicit, nobis consulens: "Ne ambulaveris in
   via cum ipsis, declixia pedem tuum a semitis eorum. Non enim injuste
   tenduntur retia pennatis. Ipsi enim, cure sint sanguinum participes,
   thesauros malorum sibi recondunt;" [2651] hoc est, sibi affectantes
   immunditiam, et proximos similia docentes, bellatores, percussores
   caudis suis, [2652] ait propheta, quas quidem Græci kerkous appellant.
   Fuerint autem ii, quos significat prophetia, libidinosi intemperantes,
   qui sunt caudis suis pugnaces, tenebrarum "irreque filii," [2653] erede
   polluti, manus sibi afferentes, et homicidæ propinquorum. "Expurgate
   ergo vetus fermentum, ut sitis novo conspersio," [2654] nobis exclamat
   Apostolus. Et rursus, propter quosdam ejusmodi homines indignans,
   præcipit, "Ne conversari quidem, si quis frater nominetur vel
   fornicator, vel avarus, vel idololatra, vel maledicus, vel ebriosus,
   vel raptor; cum eo, qui est talis, ne una quidem comedere. Ego enim per
   legem legi mortuus sum," inquit; "ut Deo vivare, cum Christo sum
   crucifixus; vivo autem non amplius ego," ut vivebam per cupiditates;
   "vivit autem in me Christus," caste et beate per obedientiam
   præceptorum. Quare tune quidem in came vivebam camaliter: "quod autem
   nunc vivo in carne, in fide vivo Filii Dei." [2655] --"In viam gentium
   ne abieritis, et ne ingrediamini in urbem Samaritanorum," [2656] a
   contraria vitæ institutione nos dehortans dicit Dominus; quoniam
   "Iniquorum virorum mala est conversatio; et hæ sunt vitæ omnium, qui
   ea, quæ sunt iniqua, efficiunt." [2657] --"Væ homini illi," inquit
   Dominus; "bonum esset el, si non natus esset, quam ut unum ex electis
   meis scandalizaret. [2658] Melius esset, ut ei mola circumponeretur, et
   in mari demergeretur, quam ut unum ex meis perverteret. [2659] Nomen
   enim Dei blasphematur propter ipsos." [2660] Unde præ clare Apostolus:
   "Scripsi," inquit, "vobis in epistola, non conversari cure
   fornicatoribus," [2661] usque ad illud: "Corpus autem non fornicationi,
   sed Domino, et Dominus corpori." [2662] Et quod matrimonium non dicat
   fomicationem, ostendit eo, quod subiungit: "An nescitis, quod qui
   adhæret meretrici, unum est corpus?" [2663] An meretricem quis dicet
   virginem, priusquam nubat? "Et ne fraudetis," inquit, "vos invicem,
   nisi ex consensu ad tempus:" [2664] per dictionem, "fraudetis,"
   ostendens matrimonii debitum esse liberorum procreationem: quod quidem
   in iis, quæ præcedunt, ostendit, dicens: "Mulieri vir debitum reddat;
   similiter autem mulier quoque viro;" [2665] post quam exsolutionem, in
   domo custodienda, et in ea quæ est in Christo fide, adjutrix est. Et
   adhuc apertius, dicens: "Iis, qui sunt juncti matrimonio, præcipio,
   inquit, non ego, sed Dominus, uxorem a viro non sepamri; sin autem
   separata fuerit, maneat innupta, vel viro reconcilietur; et virum
   uxorem non dimittere. Reliquis autem dico ego, non Dominus: Si quis
   frater," [2666] usque ad illud: "Nunc autem sancta est." [2667] Quid
   autem adhæc dicunt, qui in legem invehuntur, et in matrimonium, quasi
   sit solum a lege concessum, non autem etiam in Novo Testamento? Quid ad
   has leges latas possunt dicere, qui sationem abhorrent et generationem?
   cure "episcopum" quoque, "qui domui recte præsit," [2668] Ecclesiquoæ
   ducem constituat; domum autem Dominicam "imius mulieris" constituat
   conjugium. [2669] "Omnia" ergo dicit esse "munda mundis; pollutis autem
   et infidelibus nihil est mundum, sed polluta est eorum et mens, et
   conscientia." [2670] De ea autem voluptate, quæ est præter regulam: "Ne
   erretis," inquit; "nec fornicatores, nec idololatræ, nec adulteri, nec
   molles, nec masculorum concubitores, neque avari, neque fures, neque
   ebnosi, neque maledici, nec raptores, regnum Dei possidebunt; et nos
   quidem abluti sum us," [2671] qui in his eramus; qui autem in hanc
   tingunt intemperantiam, ex temperantia in fornicationem baptizant,
   voluptatibus et affectibus esse indulgendum decernentes, incontinentes
   ex moderatis fieri docentes, et in spe sua membrorum suorum impudentiæ
   affixi; ut a regno Dei abdicentur, non autem ut inscribantur, qui ad
   eos ventitant, efficientes; sub falso nominatæ cognitionis titulo, eam,
   qu, efficiæ ad exteriores ducit tenebras, viam ingredientes. "Quod
   reliquum est, fratres, quæcuque vera, quæcunque honesta, quæcunque
   justa, quatres, quam æcunque casta, quæcunque amabilia, ques, æcunque
   bonbilia, ques, quam ingreæ famue bonbilia, ques, quam ingredientæ; si
   qua virtus, et si qua laus, ea considerate; quæ et didicistis; quæ
   etiam accepistis et audiistis et vidistis in me, ea facite; et Deus
   pacis erit vobiscum." [2672] Et Petrus similia dicit in Epistola: "Ut
   fides vestra et spes sit in Deum, cure animas vestras castas
   effeceritis in obedientia veritatis;" [2673] quasi filii obedientiæ,
   non configurati prioribus desideriis, quæ fuerunt in ignorantia; sed
   secundum eum, qui vocavit vos, sanctum, et ipsi sancti sitis in omni

  Elucidations.

      I.

   (See p. 381, [55]cap. i.)

   In his third book, Clement exposes the Basilidians and others who
   perverted the rule of our Lord, which permissively, but not as of
   obligation, called some to the self-regimen of a single life, on
   condition of their possessing the singular gift requisite to the same.
   True continence, he argues, implies the command of the tongue, and all
   manner of concupiscence, such as greed of wealth, or luxury in using
   it. If, by a divine faculty and gift of grace, it enables us to
   practice temperance, very well; but more is necessary. As to marriage,
   he states what seems to him to be the truth. We honour celibate
   chastity, and esteem them blest to whom this is God's gift. We also
   admire a single marriage, and the dignity which pertains to one
   marriage only; admitting, nevertheless, that we ought to compassionate
   others, and to bear one another's burdens, lest any one, when he thinks
   he stands, should himself also fall. The apostle enjoins, with respect
   to a second marriage, "If thou art tempted by concupiscence, resort to
   a lawful wedlock."

   Our author then proceeds to a castigation of Carpocrates, and his son
   Epiphanes, an Alexandrian on his father's side, who, though he lived
   but seventeen years, his mother being a Cephallenian, received divine
   honours at Sama, where a magnificent temple, with altars and shrines,
   was erected to him; the Cephallenians celebrating his apotheosis, by a
   new-moon festival, with sacrifices, libations and hymns, and
   convivialities. This youth acquired, from his father, a knowledge of
   Plato's philosophy and of the circle of the sciences. He was the author
   of the jargon about monads, [2675] of which see Irenæus; and from him
   comes the heresy of those subsequently known as Carpocratians. He left
   a book, De Justitia, in which he contends for what he represents as
   Plato's idea of a community of women in sexual relations. Justly does
   our author reckon him a destroyer alike of law and Gospel, unworthy
   even of being classed with decent heretics; and he attributes to his
   followers all those abominations which had been charged upon the
   Christians. This illustrates the terrible necessity, which then
   existed, of drawing a flaming line of demarcation between the Church,
   and the wolves in sheeps' clothing, who thus dishonoured the name of
   Christ, by associating such works of the devil with the adoption of a
   nominal discipleship. It should be mentioned that Mosheim questions the
   story of Epiphanes. (See his Hist. of the First Three Centuries, vol.
   i. p. 448.)

      II.

   (See p. 383, cap. ii. note 1.)

   The early disappearance of the Christian agapæ may probably be
   attributed to the terrible abuse of the word here referred to, by the
   licentious Carpocratians. The genuine agapæ were of apostolic origin (2
   Pet. ii. 13; Jude 12), but were often abused by hypocrites, even under
   the apostolic eye (1 Corinthians 11:21). In the Gallican Church, a
   survival or relic of these feasts of charity is seen in the pain béni;
   and, in the Greek churches. in the antidoron or eulogiæ distributed to
   non-communicants at the close of the Eucharist, from the loaf out of
   which the bread of oblation is supposed to have been cut.

      III.

   (See p. 383, note 3.)

   Next, he treats of the Marcionites, who rejected marriage on the ground
   that the material creation is in itself evil. Promising elsewhere to
   deal with this general false principle, he refutes Marcion, and with
   him the Greeks who have condemned the generative law of nature,
   specifying Heraclitus, Empedocles, the Sibyl, Homer, and others; but he
   defends Plato against Marcion, who represents him as teaching the
   depravity of matter. He proceeds to what the dramatists have exhibited
   of human misery. He shows the error of those who represent the
   Pythagoreans as on that account denying themselves the intimacies of
   conjugal society; for he says they practiced this restraint, only after
   having given themselves a family. He explains the prohibition of the
   bean, by Pythagoras, on the very ground, that it occasioned sterility
   in women according to Theophrastus. Clement expounds the true meaning
   of Christ's words, perverted by those who abstained from marriage not
   in honour of encraty, but as an insane impeachment of the divine wisdom
   in the material creation.

      IV.

   (See p. 385, note 3.)

   He refutes the Carpocratians, also, in their slanders against the
   deacon Nicolas, showing that the Nicolaitans had abused his name and
   words. Likewise, concerning Matthias, he exposes a similar abuse. He
   castigates one who seduced a maiden into impurity by an absurd
   perversion of Scripture, and thoroughly exposes this blasphemous abuse
   of the apostolic text. He subjoins another refutation of one of those
   heretics, and allows that some might adopt the opinion of his dupes,
   if, as the Valentinians would profess, only spiritual communion were
   concerned.

   Seeing, however, that these heretics, and the followers of Prodicus,
   who wrongfully call themselves gnostics, claimed a practical indulgence
   in all manner of disgusting profligacies, he convicts them by arguments
   derived from right reason and from the Scriptures, and by human laws as
   well. Further, he exposes the folly of those who pretended that the
   less honourable parts of man are not the work of the Creator, and
   overwhelms their presumption by abundant argument, exploding, at the
   same time, their corruptions of the sacred text of the Scriptures.

      V.

   (See p. 388, note 3.)

   To relieve himself of a more particular struggle with each individual
   heresy, he proceeds to reduce them under two heads: (1) Those who teach
   a reckless mode of life (adiaphoros zen), and (2) those who impiously
   affect continence. To the first, he opposes the plain propriety and
   duty of a decorous way of living continently; showing, that as it
   cannot be denied that there are certain abominable and filthy lusts,
   which, as such, must be shunned, therefore there is no such thing as
   living "indifferently" with respect to them. He who lives to the flesh,
   moreover, is condemned; nor can the likeness and image of God be
   regained, or eternal life be ensured, save by a strict observance of
   divine precepts. Further, our author shows that true Christian liberty
   consists, not, as they vociferate, in self-indulgence, but, on the
   contrary, is founded in an entire freedom from perturbations of mind
   and passion, and from all filthy lusts.

      VI.

   (See p. 389, note 4.)

   As to the second class of heretics, he reproves the contemners of God's
   ordinance, who boast of a false continence, and scorn holy matrimony
   and the creation of a family. He contends with them by the authority of
   St. John, and first answers objections of theirs, based on certain
   apocryphal sayings of Christ to Salome; next, somewhat obscurely, he
   answers their notions of laws about marriage imposed in the Old Law,
   and, as they pretend, abrogated in the New; thirdly, he rebukes their
   perpetual clatter about the uncleanness of conjugal relations; and,
   fourth, he pulverizes their arguments derived from the fact, that the
   children of the resurrection "neither marry, nor are given in
   marriage."

   Then he gives his attention to another class of heretics boasting that
   they followed the example of Christ, and presuming to teach that
   marriage is of the devil. He expounds the exceptional celibacy of the
   Messiah, by the two natures of the Godman, which need nothing but a
   reverent statement to expose the fallacy of arguing from His example in
   this particular, seeing He, alone, of all the sons of men, is thus
   supreme over all considerations of human nature, pure and simple, as it
   exists in the sons of Adam. Moreover, He espoused the Church, which is
   His wife. Clement expounds very wisely those sayings of our Lord which
   put honour upon voluntary celibacy, where the gift has been imparted,
   for His better service.

   And here let it be noted, how continually the heresies of these times
   seem to turn on this matter of the sexes. It is impossible to cleanse a
   dirty house, without raising a dust and a bad smell; and heathenism,
   which had made lust into a religion, and the worship of its gods a
   school of gross vice, penetrating all classes of society, could not be
   exorcised, and give place to faith, hope and charity, without this
   process of conflict, in which Clement distinguishes himself. At the
   same time, the wisdom of our Lord's precepts and counsels are manifest,
   in this history. Alike He taught the sanctity and blessedness of
   marriage and maternity, and the exceptional blessedness of the celibate
   when received as a gift of God, for a peculiar ministry. Thus heathen
   morals were rebuked and castigated, womanhood was lifted to a sphere of
   unwonted honour, and the home was created and sanctified in the purity
   and chastity of the Christian wife; while yet a celibate chastity was
   recognised as having a high place in the Christian system. The Lord
   prescribes to all, whether married or unmarried, a law of discipline
   and evangelical encraty. The Christian homes of England and America may
   be pointed out, thank God, as illustrating the divine wisdom; while the
   degraded monasteries of Italy and Spain and South America, with the
   horrible history of enforced celibacy in the Latin priesthood, are
   proofs of the unwisdom of those who imported into the Western churches
   the very heresies and abortive argumentations which Clement disdains,
   while he pulverizes them and blows them away, thoroughly purging his
   floor, and burning up this chaff.

      VII.

   (See p. 390, note 16.)

   Here it is specially important to observe what Clement demonstrates,
   not only from the teachings of the apostles, of Elijah and Samuel and
   the Master Himself, but, finally and irrefragably, from the apostolic
   example. He names St. Peter here as elsewhere, and notes his memorable
   history as a married man. [2676] He supposes St. Paul himself to have
   been married; and he instances St. Philip the deacon, and his married
   daughters, besides giving the right exposition of a passage which
   Carpocrates had shamefully distorted from its plain significance.

      VIII.

   (See p. 391, [56]note 18.)

   He passes to a demonstration of the superiority of Christian continence
   over the sort of self-constraint lauded by Stoics and other
   philosophers. God only can enable man to practice a genuine continence,
   not merely contending with depraved lusts, but eradicating them. Here
   follow some interesting examples drawn from the brahmins and fakirs of
   India; interesting tokens, by the way, of the assaults the Gospel had
   already made upon their strongholds about the Ganges.

      IX.

   (See, p. 392, note 4.)

   Briefly he explains another text, "Sin shall not have dominion over
   you," which the heretics wrested from the purpose and intent of St.
   Paul. He also returns to a passage from the apocryphal Gospel of the
   Hebrews, and to the pretended conversation of Christ with Salome,
   treating it, perhaps, with more consideration than it merits.

      X.

   (See p. 392, note 11.)

   But this Gospel of the Hebrews, and another apocryphal Gospel, that of
   the Egyptians, may be worthy of a few words just here. Jones (On the
   Canon, vol. i. p. 206) very learnedly maintains that Clement "never saw
   it," nor used it for any quotation of his own. And, as for a Gospel
   written in the Hebrew tongue, Clement could not read Hebrew; the single
   citation he makes out of it, being, probably, at second hand. Greatly
   to the point is the argument of Lardner, [2677] therefore, who says, as
   settling the question of the value of these books, "If Clement, who
   lived at Alexandria, and was so well acquainted with almost all sorts
   of books, had (but a slight, or) no knowledge at all of them, how
   obscure must they have been; how little regarded by Catholic
   Christians."

      XI.

   (See p. 393, note 5; also Elucidation xvii. p. 408, infra.)

   Ingenious is Clement's exposition of that saying of our Lord, "Where
   two or three are met together in my name," etc. He explodes a monstrous
   exposition of the text, and ingeniously applies it to the Christian
   family. The husband and the wife living in chaste matrimony, and the
   child which God bestows, are three in sweet society, who may claim and
   enjoy the promise. This reflects great light upon the Christian home,
   as it rose, like a flower, out of the "Church in the house." Family
   prayers, the graces before and after meat, the hymn "On lighting the
   lamps at eventide," and the complines, or prayers at bedtime, are all
   the products of the divine contract to be with the "two or three" who
   are met in His name to claim that inconceivably precious promise. Other
   texts from St. Matthew are explained, in their Catholic verity, by our
   venerable author.

      XII.

   (See p. 394, note 1.)

   He further expounds the Catholic idea of marriage, and rescues, from
   heretical adulteration, the precept of Moses (Ex. xix. 15); introducing
   a lucid parallel, with the Apostolic command, [2678] "Come out from
   among them, and be separate," etc. He turns the tables on his foul
   antagonists; showing them that this very law obliges the Catholic
   Christian to separate himself alike from the abominations of the
   heathen, and from the depraved heretics who abuse the word of God, and
   "wrest the Scriptures to their own destruction." This eleventh chapter
   of the third book abounds in Scriptural citations and expositions, and
   is to be specially praised for asserting the purity of married life, in
   connection with the inspired law concerning fasting and abstinence (1
   Cor. vii. 3-5), laid down by the reasonably ascetic St. Paul.

      XIII.

   (See p. 396, note 5.)

   The melancholy example of Tatian is next instanced, in his departures
   from orthodox encraty. Against poor Tatian's garrulity, he proves the
   sanctity of marriage, alike in the New and the Old Testaments. A
   curious argument he adduces against the ceremonial washing prescribed
   by the law (Lev. xv. 18), but not against the same as a dictate of
   natural instinct. He considers that particular ceremonial law a protest
   against the polygamy which God tolerated, but never authorized, under
   Moses; and its abrogation (i.e., by the Synod of Jerusalem), is a
   testimony that there is no uncleanness, whatever, in the chaste society
   of the married pair, in Christ. He rescues other texts from the profane
   uses of the heretics, proving that our duty to abstain from laying up
   treasures here, merely layouts the care of the poor and needy; and that
   the saying, that "the children of the kingdom neither marry nor are
   given in marriage," respects only their estate after the resurrection.
   So the command about "caring for the things of God," is harmonized with
   married life. But our author dwells on the apostle's emphatic counsels
   against second marriages. It is noteworthy how deeply Clement's
   orthodoxy has rooted itself in the Greek churches, where the clergy
   must be once married, but are not permitted to marry a second time.

   A curious objection is met and dismissed. The man who excused himself
   "because he had married a wife," was a great card for heretical
   manipulations; but no need of saying that Clement knows how to turn
   this, also, upon their own hands.

      XIV.

   (See p. 398, note 8.)

   Julius Cassianus (assigned by Lardner to a.d. 190) was an Alexandrian
   Encratite, of whom, whatever his faults, Clement speaks not without
   respect. He is quoted with credit in the Stromata (book i. cap. xxi. p.
   324), but comes into notice here, as having led off the school of
   Docetism. But Clement does not treat him as he does the vulgar and
   licentious errorist. He reproves him for his use of the Gospel
   according to the Egyptians, incidentally testifying to the Catholic
   recognition of only four Gospels. He refutes a Platonic idea of
   Cassian, as to the pre-existence of the soul. Also, he promises a full
   explanation, elsewhere, of "the coats of skins" (which Cassian seems to
   have thought the flesh itself), wherewith Adam and Eve were clothed.
   Lardner refers us to Beausobre for a curious discussion of this matter.
   Clement refutes a false argument from Christ's hyperbole of hatred to
   wife and children and family ties, and also gives lucid explanations of
   passages from Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezra, which had been wrested to
   heretical abuse. In a similar manner, he overthrows what errorists had
   built upon Job's saying, "who can bring a clean thing out of the
   unclean;" as also their false teachings on the texts, "In sin hath my
   mother conceived me," "the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul,"
   and the apostolic instance of the athlete who is "temperate in all
   things."

      XV.

   (See p. 400, [57]cap. xvii. and 401, note 2.)

   He proclaims the purity of physical generation, because of the
   parturition of the Blessed Virgin; castigating the docetism of Cassian,
   who had presumed to speak of the body of Jesus as a phantasm, and the
   grosser blasphemies of Marcion and Valentinus, equally destructive to
   the Christ of the Gospel. [2679] He overturns the whims of these latter
   deceivers, about Adam's society with his wife, and concludes that our
   Lord's assumption of the flesh of His mother, was a sufficient
   corroboration of that divine law by which the generations of mankind
   are continued.

      XVI.

   (See p, 402, note 8.)

   From all which Clement concludes that his two classes of heretics are
   alike wanderers from Catholic orthodoxy; whether, on the one hand,
   under divers pretexts glorifying an unreal continence against
   honourable marriage, or, on the other, persuading themselves as
   speciously to an unlimited indulgence of their sinful lusts and
   passions. Once more he quotes the Old Testament and the New, which
   denounce uncleanness, but not the conjugal relations. He argues with
   indignation upon those who degrade the estate to which a bishop is
   called as "the husband of one wife, ruling his own house and children
   well." Then he reverts to his idea of "the two or three," maintaining
   that a holy marriage makes the bishop's home "a house of the Lord" (see
   note 75, p. 1211, ed. Migne). And he concludes the book by repeating
   his remonstrance against the claim of these heretics to be veritable
   Gnostics,--a name he will by no means surrender to the enemies of
   truth.

      XVII.

   ([58]On Matt. xviii. 20, p. 393; and, see Elucidation XI, supra.)

   To the interpretation I have thought preferable, and which I ventured
   to enlarge, it should be added that our author subjoins others, founded
   on flesh, soul, and spirit; on vocation, election, and the Gnostic
   accepting both; and on the Jew and the Gentile, and the Church gathered
   from each race.

   Over and over again Clement asserts that a life of chaste wedlock is
   not to be accounted imperfect.

   On the celibate in practice, see Le Célibat des Prêtres, par l'abbé
   Chavard, Genèva, 1874.

      XVIII.

   The Commentaria of Le Nourry have been my guide to the brief analysis
   of these Elucidations, though I have not always allowed the learned
   Benedictine to dictate an opinion, or to control my sense of our
   author's argument.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [2440] After much consideration, the Editors have deemed it best to
   give the whole of this book in Latin. [In the former Book, Clement has
   shown, not without a decided leaning to chaste celibacy, that marriage
   is a holy estate, and consistent with the perfect man in Christ. He now
   enters upon the refutation of the false-Gnostics and their licentious
   tenets. Professing a stricter rule to begin with, and despising the
   ordinances of the Creator, their result was the grossest immorality in
   practice. The melancholy consequences of an enforced celibacy are,
   here, all foreseen and foreshown; and this Book, though necessarily
   offensive to our Christian tastes, is most useful as a commentary upon
   the history of monasticism, and the celibacy of priests, in the Western
   churches. The resolution of the Edinburgh editors to give this Book to
   scholars only, in the Latin, is probably wise. I subjoin a succint
   analysis, in the elucidations.]

      Chapter I.--Order of Contents.

   It will follow, I think, that I should treat of martyrdom, and of who
   the perfect man is. With these points shall be included what follows in
   accordance with the demands of the points to be spoken about, and how
   both bond and free must equally philosophize, whether male or female in
   sex. And in the sequel, after finishing what is to be said on faith and
   inquiry, we shall set forth the department of symbols; so that, on
   cursorily concluding the discourse on ethics, we shall exhibit the
   advantage which has accrued to the Greeks from the barbarian
   philosophy. After which sketch, the brief explanation of the Scriptures
   both against the Greeks and against the Jews will be presented, and
   whatever points we were unable to embrace in the previous Miscellanies
   (through having respect necessarily to the multitude of matters), in
   accordance with the commencement of the poem, purposing to finish them
   in one commentary. In addition to these points, afterwards on
   completing the sketch, as far as we can in accordance with what we
   propose, we must give an account of the physical doctrines of the
   Greeks and of the barbarians, respecting elementary principles, as far
   as their opinions have reached us, and argue against the principal
   views excogitated by the philosophers.

   It will naturally fall after these, after a cursory view of theology,
   to discuss the opinions handed down respecting prophecy; so that,
   having demonstrated that the Scriptures which we believe are valid from
   their omnipotent authority, we shall be able to go over them
   consecutively, and to show thence to all the heresies one God and
   Omnipotent Lord to be truly preached by the law and the prophets, and
   besides by the blessed Gospel. Many contradictions against the
   heterodox await us while we attempt, in writing, to do away with the
   force of the allegations made by them, and to persuade them against
   their will, proving by the Scriptures themselves.

   On completing, then, the whole of what we propose in the commentaries,
   on which, if the Spirit will, we ministering to the urgent need, (for
   it is exceedingly necessary, before coming to the truth, to embrace
   what ought to be said by way of preface), shall address ourselves to
   the true gnostic science of nature, receiving initiation into the minor
   mysteries before the greater; so that nothing may be in the way of the
   truly divine declaration of sacred things, the subjects requiring
   preliminary detail and statement being cleared away, and sketched
   beforehand. The science of nature, then, or rather observation, as
   contained in the gnostic tradition according to the rule of the truth,
   depends on the discussion concerning cosmogony, ascending thence to the
   department of theology. Whence, then, we shall begin our account of
   what is handed down, with the creation as related by the prophets,
   introducing also the tenets of the heterodox, and endeavouring as far
   as we can to confute them. But it shall be written if God will, and as
   He inspires; and now we must proceed to what we proposed, and complete
   the discourse on ethics.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter II.--The Meaning of the Name Stromata or Miscellanies.

   Let these notes of ours, as we have often said for the sake of those
   that consult them carelessly and unskilfully, be of varied
   character--and as the name itself indicates, patched together--passing
   constantly from one thing to another, and in the series of discussions
   hinting at one thing and demonstrating another. "For those who seek for
   gold," says Heraclitus, "dig much earth and find little gold." But
   those who are of the truly golden race, in mining for what is allied to
   them, will find the much in little. For the word will find one to
   understand it. The Miscellanies of notes contribute, then, to the
   recollection and expression of truth in the case of him who is able to
   investigate with reason. And you must prosecute, in addition to these,
   other labours and researches; since, in the case of people who are
   setting out on a road with which they are unacquainted, it is
   sufficient merely to point out the direction. After this they must walk
   and find out the rest for themselves. As, they say, when a certain
   slave once asked at the oracle what he should do to please his master,
   the Pythian priestess replied, "You will find if you seek." It is truly
   a difficult matter, then, as turns out, to find out latent good; since


   "Before virtue is placed exertion,

   And long and steep is the way to it,

   And rough at first; but when the summit is reached,

   Then is it easy, though difficult [before]."

   "For narrow," in truth, "and strait is the way" of the Lord. And it is
   to the "violent that the kingdom of God belongs." [2680]

   Whence, "Seek, and ye shall find," holding on by the truly royal road,
   and not deviating. As we might expect, then, the generative power of
   the seeds of the doctrines comprehended in this treatise is great in
   small space, as the "universal herbage of the field," [2681] as
   Scripture saith. Thus the Miscellanies of notes have their proper
   title, wonderfully like that ancient oblation culled from all sorts of
   things of which Sophocles writes:--


   "For there was a sheep's fleece, and there was a vine,

   And a libation, and grapes well stored;

   And there was mixed with it fruit of all kinds,

   And the fat of the olive, and the most curious

   Wax-formed work of the yellow bee."

   Just so our Stromata, according to the husbandman of the comic poet
   Timocles, produce "figs, olives, dried figs, honey, as from an
   all-fruitful field;" on account of which exuberance he adds:--


   "Thou speakest of a harvest-wreath not of husbandry."

   For the Athenians were wont to cry:--


   "The harvest-wreath bears figs and fat loaves,

   And honey in a cup, and olive oil to anoint you."

   We must then often, as in winnowing sieves, shake and toss up this the
   great mixture of seeds, in order to separate the wheat.

      Chapter III.--The True Excellence of Man.

   The most of men have a disposition unstable and heedless, like the
   nature of storms. "Want of faith has done many good things, and faith
   evil things." And Epicharmus says, "Don't forget to exercise
   incredulity; for it is the sinews of the soul." Now, to disbelieve
   truth brings death, as to believe, life; and again, to believe the lie
   and to disbelieve the truth hurries to destruction. The same is the
   case with self-restraint and licentiousness. To restrain one's self
   from doing good is the work of vice; but to keep from wrong is the
   beginning of salvation. So the Sabbath, by abstinence from evils, seems
   to indicate self-restraint. And what, I ask, is it in which man differs
   from beasts, and the angels of God, on the other hand, are wiser than
   he? "Thou madest him a little lower than the angels." [2682] For some
   do not interpret this Scripture of the Lord, although He also bore
   flesh, but of the perfect man and the gnostic, inferior in comparison
   with the angels in time, and by reason of the vesture [of the body]. I
   call then wisdom nothing but science, since life differs not from life.
   For to live is common to the mortal nature, that is to man, with that
   to which has been vouchsafed immortality; as also the faculty of
   contemplation and of self-restraint, one of the two being more
   excellent. On this ground Pythagoras seems to me to have said that God
   alone is wise, since also the apostle writes in the Epistle to the
   Romans, "For the obedience of the faith among all nations, being made
   known to the only wise God through Jesus Christ;" [2683] and that he
   himself was a philosopher, on account of his friendship with God.
   Accordingly it is said, "God talked with Moses as a friend with a
   friend." [2684] That, then, which is true being clear to God, forthwith
   generates truth. And the gnostic loves the truth. "Go," it is said, "to
   the ant, thou sluggard, and be the disciple of the bee;" thus speaks
   Solomon. [2685] For if there is one function belonging to the peculiar
   nature of each creature, alike of the ox, and horse, and dog, what
   shall we say is the peculiar function of man? He is like, it appears to
   me, the Centaur, a Thessalian figment, compounded of a rational and
   irrational part, of soul and body. Well, the body tills the ground, and
   hastes to it; but the soul is raised to God: trained in the true
   philosophy, it speeds to its kindred above, turning away from the lusts
   of the body, and besides these, from toil and fear, although we have
   shown that patience and fear belong to the good man. For if "by the law
   is the knowledge of sin," [2686] as those allege who disparage the law,
   and "till the law sin was in the world;" [2687] yet "without the law
   sin was dead," [2688] we oppose them. For when you take away the cause
   of fear, sin, you have taken away fear; and much more, punishment, when
   you have taken away that which gives rise to lust. "For the law is not
   made for the just man," [2689] says the Scripture. Well, then, says
   Heraclitus, "They would not have known the name of Justice if these
   things had not been." And Socrates says, "that the law was not made for
   the sake of the good." But the cavillers did not know even this, as the
   apostle says, "that he who loveth his brother worketh not evil;" for
   this, "Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt
   not steal; and if there be any other commandment, it is comprehended in
   the word, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself." [2690] So also is
   it said, "Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thou
   shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." [2691] And "if he that loveth his
   neighbour worketh no evil," and if "every commandment is comprehended
   in this, the loving our neighbour," the commandments, by menacing with
   fear, work love, not hatred. Wherefore the law is productive of the
   emotion of fear. "So that the law is holy," and in truth "spiritual,"
   [2692] according to the apostle. We must, then, as is fit, in
   investigating the nature of the body and the essence of the soul,
   apprehend the end of each, and not regard death as an evil. "For when
   ye were the servants of sin," says the apostle, "ye were free from
   righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those things in which ye are
   now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now, being made
   free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
   holiness, and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death:
   but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord."
   [2693] The assertion, then, may be hazarded, that it has been shown
   that death is the fellowship of the soul in a state of sin with the
   body; and life the separation from sin. And many are the stakes and
   ditches of lust which impede us, and the pits of wrath and anger which
   must be overleaped, and all the machinations we must avoid of those who
   plot against us,--who would no longer see the knowledge of God "through
   a glass."


   "The half of virtue the far-seeing Zeus takes

   From man, when he reduces him to a state of slavery."

   As slaves the Scripture views those "under sin" and "sold to sin," the
   lovers of pleasure and of the body; and beasts rather than men, "those
   who have become like to cattle, horses, neighing after their
   neighbours' wives." [2694] The licentious is "the lustful ass," the
   covetous is the "savage wolf," and the deceiver is "a serpent." The
   severance, therefore, of the soul from the body, made a life-long
   study, produces in the philosopher gnostic alacrity, so that he is
   easily able to bear natural death, which is the dissolution of the
   chains which bind the soul to the body. "For the world is crucified to
   me, and I to the world," the [apostle] says; "and now I live, though in
   the flesh, as having my conversation in heaven." [2695]

      Chapter IV.--The Praises of Martyrdom.

   Whence, as is reasonable, the gnostic, when galled, obeys easily, and
   gives up his body to him who asks; and, previously divesting himself of
   the affections of this carcase, not insulting the tempter, but rather,
   in my opinion, training him and convincing him,--


   "From what honour and what extent of wealth fallen,"

   as says Empedocles, here for the future he walks with mortals. He, in
   truth, bears witness to himself that he is faithful and loyal towards
   God; and to the tempter, that he in vain envied him who is faithful
   through love; and to the Lord, of the inspired persuasion in reference
   to His doctrine, from which he will not depart through fear of death;
   further, he confirms also the truth of preaching by his deed, showing
   that God to whom he hastes is powerful. You will wonder at his love,
   which he conspicuously shows with thankfulness, in being united to what
   is allied to him, and besides by his precious blood, shaming the
   unbelievers. He then avoids denying Christ through fear by reason of
   the command; nor does he sell his faith in the hope of the gifts
   prepared, but in love to the Lord he will most gladly depart from this
   life; perhaps giving thanks both to him who afforded the cause of his
   departure hence, and to him who laid the plot against him, for
   receiving an honourable reason which he himself furnished not, for
   showing what he is, to him by his patience, and to the Lord in love, by
   which even before his birth he was manifested to the Lord, who knew the
   martyr's choice. With good courage, then, he goes to the Lord, his
   friend, for whom he voluntarily gave his body, and, as his judges
   hoped, his soul, hearing from our Saviour the words of poetry, "Dear
   brother," by reason of the similarity of his life. We call martyrdom
   perfection, not because the man comes to the end of his life as others,
   but because he has exhibited the perfect work of love. And the ancients
   laud the death of those among the Greeks who died in war, not that they
   advised people to die a violent death, but because he who ends his life
   in war is released without the dread of dying, severed from the body
   without experiencing previous suffering or being enfeebled in his soul,
   as the people that suffer in diseases. For they depart in a state of
   effeminacy and desiring to live; and therefore they do not yield up the
   soul pure, but bearing with it their lusts like weights of lead; all
   but those who have been conspicuous in virtue. Some die in battle with
   their lusts, these being in no respect different from what they would
   have been if they had wasted away by disease.

   If the confession to God is martyrdom, each soul which has lived purely
   in the knowledge of God, which has obeyed the commandments, is a
   witness both by life and word, in whatever way it may be released from
   the body,--shedding faith as blood along its whole life till its
   departure. For instance, the Lord says in the Gospel, "Whosoever shall
   leave father, or mother, or brethren," and so forth, "for the sake of
   the Gospel and my name," [2696] he is blessed; not indicating simple
   martyrdom, but the gnostic martyrdom, as of the man who has conducted
   himself according to the rule of the Gospel, in love to the Lord (for
   the knowledge of the Name and the understanding of the Gospel point out
   the gnosis, but not the bare appellation), so as to leave his worldly
   kindred, and wealth, and every possession, in order to lead a life free
   from passion. "Mother" figuratively means country and sustenance;
   "fathers" are the laws of civil polity: which must be contemned
   thankfully by the high-souled just man; for the sake of being the
   friend of God, and of obtaining the right hand in the holy place, as
   the Apostles have done.

   Then Heraclitus says, "Gods and men honour those slain in battle;" and
   Plato in the fifth book of the Republic writes, "Of those who die in
   military service, whoever dies after winning renown, shall we not say
   that he is chief of the golden race? Most assuredly." But the golden
   race is with the gods, who are in heaven, in the fixed sphere, who
   chiefly hold command in the providence exercised towards men. Now some
   of the heretics who have misunderstood the Lord, have at once an
   impious and cowardly love of life; saying that the true martyrdom is
   the knowledge of the only true God (which we also admit), and that the
   man is a self-murderer and a suicide who makes confession by death; and
   adducing other similar sophisms of cowardice. To these we shall reply
   at the proper time; for they differ with us in regard to first
   principles. Now we, too, say that those who have rushed on death (for
   there are some, not belonging to us, but sharing the name merely, who
   are in haste to give themselves up, the poor wretches dying through
   hatred to the Creator [2697] )--these, we say, banish themselves
   without being martyrs, even though they are punished publicly. For they
   do not preserve the characteristic mark of believing martyrdom,
   inasmuch as they have not known the only true God, but give themselves
   up to a vain death, as the Gymnosophists of the Indians to useless
   fire.

   But since these falsely named [2698] calumniate the body, let them
   learn that the harmonious mechanism of the body contributes to the
   understanding which leads to goodness of nature. Wherefore in the third
   book of the Republic, Plato, whom they appeal to loudly as an authority
   that disparages generation, says, "that for the sake of harmony of
   soul, care must be taken for the body," by which, he who announces the
   proclamation of the truth, finds it possible to live, and to live well.
   For it is by the path of life and health that we learn gnosis. But is
   he who cannot advance to the height without being occupied with
   necessary things, and through them doing what tends to knowledge, not
   to choose to live well? In living, then, living well is secured. And he
   who in the body has devoted himself to a good life, is being sent on to
   the state of immortality.

      Chapter V.--On Contempt for Pain, Poverty, and Other External Things.

   Fit objects for admiration are the Stoics, who say that the soul is not
   affected by the body, either to vice by disease, or to virtue by
   health; but both these things, they say, are indifferent. And indeed
   Job, through exceeding continence, and excellence of faith, when from
   rich he became poor, from being held in honour dishonoured, from being
   comely unsightly, and sick from being healthy, is depicted as a good
   example, putting the Tempter to shame, blessing his Creator; bearing
   what came second, as the first, and most clearly teaching that it is
   possible for the gnostic to make an excellent use of all circumstances.
   And that ancient achievements are proposed as images for our
   correction, the apostle shows, when he says, "So that my bonds in
   Christ are become manifest in all the palace, and to all the rest; and
   several of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are
   much more bold to speak the word of God without fear," [2699] --since
   martyrs' testimonies are examples of conversion gloriously sanctified.
   "For what things the Scripture speaks were written for our instruction,
   that we, through patience and the consolation of the Scriptures, might
   have the hope of consolation." [2700] When pain is present, the soul
   appears to decline from it, and to deem release from present pain a
   precious thing. At that moment it slackens from studies, when the other
   virtues also are neglected. And yet we do not say that it is virtue
   itself which suffers, for virtue is not affected by disease. But he who
   is partaker of both, of virtue and the disease, is afflicted by the
   pressure of the latter; and if he who has not yet attained the habit of
   self-command be not a high-souled man, he is distraught; and the
   inability to endure it is found equivalent to fleeing from it.

   The same holds good also in the case of poverty. For it compels the
   soul to desist from necessary things, I mean contemplation and from
   pure sinlessness, forcing him, who has not wholly dedicated himself to
   God in love, to occupy himself about provisions; as, again, health and
   abundance of necessaries keep the soul free and unimpeded, and capable
   of making a good use of what is at hand. "For," says the apostle, "such
   shall have trouble in the flesh. But I spare you. For I would have you
   without anxiety, in order to decorum and assiduity for the Lord,
   without distraction." [2701]

   These things, then, are to be abstained from, not for their own sakes,
   but for the sake of the body; and care for the body is exercised for
   the sake of the soul, to which it has reference. For on this account it
   is necessary for the man who lives as a gnostic to know what is
   suitable. Since the fact that pleasure is not a good thing is admitted
   from the fact that certain pleasures are evil, by this reason good
   appears evil, and evil good. And then, if we choose some pleasures and
   shun others, it is not every pleasure that is a good thing.

   Similarly, also, the same rule holds with pains, some of which we
   endure, and others we shun. But choice and avoidance are exercised
   according to knowledge; so that it is not pleasure that is the good
   thing, but knowledge by which we shall choose a pleasure at a certain
   time, and of a certain kind. Now the martyr chooses the pleasure that
   exists in prospect through the present pain. If pain is conceived as
   existing in thirst, and pleasure in drinking, the pain that has
   preceded becomes the efficient cause of pleasure. But evil cannot be
   the efficient cause of good. Neither, then, is the one thing nor the
   other evil. Simonides accordingly (as also Aristotle) writes, "that to
   be in good health is the best thing, and the second best thing is to be
   handsome, and the third best thing is to be rich without cheating."

   And Theognis of Megara says:--


   "You must, to escape poverty, throw

   Yourself, O Cyrnus, down from

   The steep rocks into the deep sea."

   On the other hand, Antiphanes, the comic poet, says, "Plutus (Wealth),
   when it has taken hold of those who see better than others, makes them
   blind." Now by the poets he is proclaimed as blind from his birth:--


   "And brought him forth blind who saw not the sun."

   Says the Chalcidian Euphorion:--


   "Riches, then, and extravagant luxuries,

   Were for men the worst training for manliness."

   Wrote Euripides in Alexander:--


   "And it is said,

   Penury has attained wisdom through misfortune;

   But much wealth will capture not

   Sparta alone, but every city."

   "It is not then the only coin that mortals have, that which is white
   silver or golden, but virtue too," as Sophocles says.

      Chapter VI.--Some Points in the Beatitudes.

   Our holy Saviour applied poverty and riches, and the like, both to
   spiritual things and objects of sense. For when He said, "Blessed are
   they that are persecuted for righteousness' sake," [2702] He clearly
   taught us in every circumstance to seek for the martyr who, if poor for
   righteousness' sake, witnesses that the righteousness which he loves is
   a good thing; and if he "hunger and thirst for righteousness' sake,"
   testifies that righteousness is the best thing. Likewise he, that weeps
   and mourns for righteousness' sake, testifies to the best law that it
   is beautiful. As, then, "those that are persecuted," so also "those
   that hunger and thirst" for righteousness' sake, are called "blessed"
   by Him who approves of the true desire, which not even famine can put a
   stop to. And if "they hunger after righteousness itself," they are
   blessed. "And blessed are the poor," whether "in spirit" or in
   circumstance"--that is, if for righteousness' sake. It is not the poor
   simply, but those that have wished to become poor for righteousness'
   sake, that He pronounces blessed--those who have despised the honours
   of this world in order to attain "the good;" likewise also those who,
   through chastity, have become comely in person and character, and those
   who are of noble birth, and honourable, having through righteousness
   attained to adoption, and therefore "have received power to become the
   sons of God," [2703] and "to tread on serpents and scorpions," and to
   rule over demons and "the host of the adversary." [2704] And, in fine,
   the Lord's discipline [2705] draws the soul away gladly from the body,
   even if it wrench itself away in its removal. "For he that loveth his
   life shall lose it, and he that loseth his life shall find it," [2706]
   if we only join that which is mortal of us with the immortality of God.
   It is the will of God [that we should attain] the knowledge of God,
   which is the communication of immortality. He therefore, who, in
   accordance with the word of repentance, knows his life to be sinful
   will lose it--losing it from sin, from which it is wrenched; but losing
   it, will find it, according to the obedience which lives again to
   faith, but dies to sin. This, then, is what it is "to find one's life,"
   "to know one's self."

   The conversion, however, which leads to divine things, the Stoics say,
   is affected by a change, the soul being changed to wisdom. And Plato:
   "On the soul taking a turn to what is better, and a change from a kind
   of nocturnal day." Now the philosophers also allow the good man an exit
   from life in accordance with reason, in the case of one depriving him
   of active exertion, so that the hope of action is no longer left him.
   And the judge who compels us to deny Him whom we love, I regard as
   showing who is and who is not the friend of God. In that case there is
   not left ground for even examining what one prefers--the menaces of man
   or the love of God. And abstinence from vicious acts is found, somehow,
   [to result in] the diminution and extinction of vicious propensities,
   their energy being destroyed by inaction. And this is the import of
   "Sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and come, follow Me" [2707]
   --that is, follow what is said by the Lord. Some say that by what "thou
   hast" He designated the things in the soul, of a nature not akin to it,
   though how these are bestowed on the poor they are not able to say. For
   God dispenses to all according to desert, His distribution being
   righteous. Despising, therefore, the possessions which God apportions
   to thee in thy magnificence, comply with what is spoken by me; haste to
   the ascent of the Spirit, being not only justified by abstinence from
   what is evil, but in addition also perfected, by Christlike
   beneficence. [2708] In this instance He convicted the man, who boasted
   that he had fulfilled the injunctions of the law, of not loving his
   neighbour; and it is by beneficence that the love which, according to
   the gnostic ascending scale, is Lord of the Sabbath, proclaims itself.
   [2709] We must then, according to my view, have recourse to the word of
   salvation neither from fear of punishment nor promise of a gift, but on
   account of the good itself. Such, as do so, stand on the right hand of
   the sanctuary; but those who think that by the gift of what is
   perishable they shall receive in exchange what belongs to immortality
   are in the parable of the two brothers called "hirelings." And is there
   not some light thrown here on the expression "in the likeness and
   image," in the fact that some live according to the likeness of Christ,
   while those who stand on the left hand live according to their image?
   There are then two things proceeding from the truth, one root lying
   beneath both,--the choice being, however, not equal, or rather the
   difference that is in the choice not being equal. To choose by way of
   imitation differs, as appears to me, from the choice of him who chooses
   according to knowledge, as that which is set on fire differs from that
   which is illuminated. Israel, then, is the light of the likeness which
   is according to the Scripture. But the image is another thing. What
   means the parable of Lazarus, by showing the image of the rich and
   poor? And what the saying, "No man can serve two masters, God and
   Mammon?"--the Lord so terming the love of money. For instance, the
   covetous, who were invited, responded not to the invitation to the
   supper, not because of their possessing property, but of their
   inordinate affection to what they possessed. "The foxes," then, have
   holes. He called those evil and earthly men who are occupied about the
   wealth which is mined and dug from the ground, foxes. Thus also, in
   reference to Herod: "Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and
   perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I shall be
   perfected." [2710] For He applied the name "fowls of the air" to those
   who were distinct from the other birds--those really pure, those that
   have the power of flying to the knowledge of the heavenly Word. For not
   riches only, but also honour, and marriage, and poverty, have ten
   thousand cares for him who is unfit for them. [2711] And those cares He
   indicated in the parable of the fourfold seed, when He said that "the
   seed of the word which fell unto the thorns" and hedges was choked by
   them, and could not bring forth fruit. It is therefore necessary to
   learn how to make use of every occurrence, so as by a good life,
   according to knowledge, to be trained for the state of eternal life.
   For it said, "I saw the wicked exalted and towering as the cedars of
   Lebanon; and I passed," says the Scripture, "and, lo, he was not; and I
   sought him, and his place was not found. Keep innocence, and look on
   uprightness: for there is a remnant to the man of peace." [2712] Such
   will he be who believes unfeignedly with his whole heart, and is
   tranquil in his whole soul. "For the different people honour me with
   their lips, but their heart is far from the Lord." [2713] "They bless
   with their mouth, but they curse in their heart." [2714] "They loved
   Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their
   heart was not right with Him, and they were not faithful to His
   covenant." Wherefore "let the false lips become speechless, and let the
   Lord destroy the boastful tongue: those who say, We shall magnify our
   tongue, and our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? For the
   affliction of the poor and the groaning of the needy now will I arise,
   saith the Lord; I will set him in safety; I will speak out in his
   case." [2715] For it is to the humble that Christ belongs, who do not
   exalt themselves against His flock. "Lay not up for yourselves,
   therefore, treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and
   thieves break through and steal," [2716] says the Lord, in reproach
   perchance of the covetous, and perchance also of those who are simply
   anxious and full of cares, and those too who indulge their bodies. For
   amours, and diseases, and evil thoughts "break through" the mind and
   the whole man. But our true "treasure" is where what is allied to our
   mind is, since it bestows the communicative power of righteousness,
   showing that we must assign to the habit of our old conversation what
   we have acquired by it, and have recourse to God, beseeching mercy. He
   is, in truth, "the bag that waxeth not old," the provisions of eternal
   life, "the treasure that faileth not in heaven." [2717] "For I will
   have mercy on whom I will have mercy," [2718] saith the Lord. And they
   say those things to those who wish to be poor for righteousness' sake.
   For they have heard in the commandment that "the broad and wide way
   leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it." [2719] It
   is not of anything else that the assertion is made, but of profligacy,
   and love of women, and love of glory, and ambition, and similar
   passions. For so He says, "Fool, this night shall thy soul be required
   of thee; and whose shall those things be which thou hast prepared?"
   [2720] And the commandment is expressed in these very words, "Take
   heed, therefore, of covetousness. For a man's life does not consist in
   the abundance of those things which he possesses. For what shall it
   profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?
   or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" [2721] "Wherefore I
   say, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for your
   body, what ye shall put on. For your life is more than meat, and your
   body than raiment." [2722] And again, "For your Father knoweth that ye
   have need of all these things." "But seek first the kingdom of heaven,
   and its righteousness," for these are the great things, and the things
   which are small and appertain to this life "shall be added to you."
   [2723] Does He not plainly then exhort us to follow the gnostic life,
   and enjoin us to seek the truth in word and deed? Therefore Christ, who
   trains the soul, reckons one rich, not by his gifts, but by his choice.
   It is said, therefore, that Zaccheus, or, according to some, Matthew,
   the chief of the publicans, on hearing that the Lord had deigned to
   come to him, said, "Lord, and if I have taken anything by false
   accusation, I restore him fourfold;" on which the Saviour said, "The
   Son of man, on coming to-day, has found that which was lost." [2724]
   Again, on seeing the rich cast into the treasury according to their
   wealth, and the widow two mites, He said "that the widow had cast in
   more than they all," for "they had contributed of their abundance, but
   she of her destitution." And because He brought all things to bear on
   the discipline of the soul, He said, "Blessed are the meek: for they
   shall inherit the earth." [2725] And the meek are those who have
   quelled the battle of unbelief in the soul, the battle of wrath, and
   lust, and the other forms that are subject to them. And He praises
   those meek by choice, not by necessity. For there are with the Lord
   both rewards and "many mansions," corresponding to men's lives.
   "Whosoever shall receive," says He, "a prophet in the name of a
   prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive
   a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a
   righteous man's reward; and whoso shall receive one of the least of
   these my disciples, shall not lose his reward." [2726] And again, the
   differences of virtue according to merit, and the noble rewards, He
   indicated by the hours unequal in number; and in addition, by the equal
   reward given to each of the labourers--that is, salvation, which is
   meant by the penny--He indicated the equality of justice; and the
   difference of those called He intimated, by those who worked for
   unequal portions of time. They shall work, therefore, in accordance
   with the appropriate mansions of which they have been deemed worthy as
   rewards, being fellow-workers in the ineffable administration and
   service. [2727] "Those, then," says Plato, "who seem called to a holy
   life, are those who, freed and released from those earthly localities
   as from prisons, have reached the pure dwelling-place on high." In
   clearer terms again he expresses the same thing: "Those who by
   philosophy have been sufficiently purged from those things, live
   without bodies entirely for all time. Although they are enveloped in
   certain shapes; in the case of some, of air, and others, of fire." He
   adds further: "And they reach abodes fairer than those, which it is not
   easy, nor is there sufficient time now to describe." Whence with
   reason, "blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted;"
   [2728] for they who have repented of their former evil life shall
   attain to "the calling" (klesin), for this is the meaning of being
   comforted (paraklethenai). And there are two styles of penitents.
   [2729] That which is more common is fear on account of what is done;
   but the other which is more special, the shame which the spirit feels
   in itself arising from conscience. Whether then, here or elsewhere (for
   no place is devoid of the beneficence of God), He again says, "Blessed
   are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy." And mercy is not, as
   some of the philosophers have imagined, pain on account of others'
   calamities, but rather something good, as the prophets say. For it is
   said, "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice." [2730] And He [2731]
   means by the merciful, not only those who do acts of mercy, but those
   who wish to do them, though they be not able; who do as far as purpose
   is concerned. For sometimes we wish by the gift of money or by personal
   effort to do mercy, as to assist one in want, or help one who is sick,
   or stand by one who is in any emergency; and are not able either from
   poverty, or disease, or old age (for this also is natural disease), to
   carry out our purpose, in reference to the things to which we are
   impelled, being unable to conduct them to the end we wished. Those, who
   have entertained the wish whose purpose is equal, share in the same
   honour with those who have the ability, although others have the
   advantage in point of resources. [2732] And since there are two paths
   of reaching the perfection of salvation, works and knowledge, He called
   the "pure in heart blessed, for they shall see God." [2733] And if we
   really look to the truth of the matter, knowledge is the purification
   of the leading faculty of the soul, and is a good activity. Some things
   accordingly are good in themselves, and others by participation in what
   is good, as we say good actions are good. But without things
   intermediate which hold the place of material, neither good nor bad
   actions are constituted, such I mean as life, and health, and other
   necessary things or circumstantials. Pure then as respects corporeal
   lusts, and pure in respect of holy thoughts, he means those are, who
   attain to the knowledge of God, when the chief faculty of the soul has
   nothing spurious to stand in the way of its power. When, therefore, he
   who partakes gnostically of this holy quality devotes himself to
   contemplation, communing in purity with the divine, he enters more
   nearly into the state of impassible identity, so as no longer to have
   science and possess knowledge, but to be science and knowledge.

   "Blessed, then, are the peacemakers," [2734] who have subdued and tamed
   the law which wars against the disposition of the mind, the menaces of
   anger, and the baits of lust, and the other passions which war against
   the reason; who, having lived in the knowledge both of good works and
   true reason, shall be reinstated in adoption, which is dearer. It
   follows that the perfect peacemaking is that which keeps unchanged in
   all circumstances what is peaceful; calls Providence holy and good; and
   has its being in the knowledge of divine and human affairs, by which it
   deems the opposites that are in the world to be the fairest harmony of
   creation. They also are peacemakers, who teach those who war against
   the stratagems of sin to have recourse to faith and peace. And it is
   the sum of all virtue, in my opinion, when the Lord teaches us that for
   love to God we must gnostically despise death. "Blessed are they," says
   He, "who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for they shall be
   called the sons of God;" [2735] or, as some of those who transpose the
   Gospels [2736] say, "Blessed are they who are persecuted by
   righteousness, for they shall be perfect." And, "Blessed are they who
   are persecuted for my sake; for they shall have a place where they
   shall not be persecuted." And, "Blessed are ye when men shall hate you,
   when they shall separate you, when they shall cast out your name as
   evil, for the Son of man's sake;" [2737] if we do not detest our
   persecutors, and undergo punishments at their hands, not hating them
   under the idea that we have been put to trial more tardily than we
   looked for; but knowing this also, that every instance of trial is an
   occasion for testifying.

      Chapter VII.--The Blessedness of the Martyr.

   Then he who has lied and shown himself unfaithful, and revolted to the
   devil's army, in what evil do we think him to be? He belies, therefore,
   the Lord, or rather he is cheated of his own hope who believes not God;
   and he believes not who does not what He has commanded.

   And what? Does not he, who denies the Lord, deny himself? For does he
   not rob his Master of His authority, who deprives himself of his
   relation to Him? He, then, who denies the Saviour, denies life; for
   "the light was life." [2738] He does not term those men of little
   faith, but faithless and hypocrites, [2739] who have the name inscribed
   on them, but deny that they are really believers. But the faithful is
   called both servant and friend. So that if one loves himself, he loves
   the Lord, and confesses to salvation that he may save his soul. Though
   you die for your neighbour out of love, and regard the Saviour as our
   neighbour (for God who saves is said to be nigh in respect to what is
   saved); you do so, choosing death on account of life, and suffering for
   your own sake rather than his. And is it not for this that he is called
   brother? he who, suffering out of love to God, suffered for his own
   salvation; while he, on the other hand, who dies for his own salvation,
   endures for love to the Lord. For he being life, in what he suffered
   wished to suffer that we might live by his suffering.

   "Why call ye me Lord, Lord," He says, "and do not the things which I
   say?" [2740] For "the people that loveth with their lips, but have
   their heart far away from the Lord," [2741] is another people, and
   trust in another, and have willingly sold themselves to another; but
   those who perform the commandments of the Lord, in every action
   "testify," by doing what He wishes, and consistently naming the Lord's
   name; and "testifying" by deed to Him in whom they trust, that they are
   those "who have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts."
   "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit." [2742] "He
   that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he
   that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting."
   [2743]

   But to those miserable men, witness to the Lord by blood seems a most
   violent death, not knowing that such a gate of death is the beginning
   of the true life; and they will understand neither the honours after
   death, which belong to those who have lived holily, nor the punishments
   of those who have lived unrighteously and impurely. [2744] I do not say
   only from our Scriptures (for almost all the commandments indicate
   them); but they will not even hear their own discourses. For the
   Pythagorean Theano writes, "Life were indeed a feast to the wicked,
   who, having done evil, then die; were not the soul immortal, death
   would be a godsend." And Plato in the Phædo, "For if death were release
   from everything," and so forth. We are not then to think according to
   the Telephus of Æschylus, "that a single path leads to Hades." The ways
   are many, and the sins that lead thither. Such deeply erring ones as
   the unfaithful are, Aristophanes properly makes the subjects of comedy.
   "Come," he says, "ye men of obscure life, ye that are like the race of
   leaves, feeble, wax figures, shadowy tribes, evanescent, fleeting,
   ephemeral." And Epicharmus, "This nature of men is inflated skins." And
   the Saviour has said to us, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is
   weak." [2745] "Because the carnal mind is enmity against God," explains
   the apostle: "for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed,
   can be. And they that are in the flesh cannot please God." And in
   further explanation continues, that no one may, like Marcion [2746]
   regard the creature as evil. "But if Christ be in you, the body is dead
   because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness." And
   again: "For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. For I reckon that
   the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared to
   the glory which shall be revealed in us. If we suffer with Him, that we
   also may be glorified together as joint-heirs of Christ. And we know
   that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them
   that are called according to the purpose. For whom He did foreknow, He
   also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He
   might be the first-born among many brethren. And whom He did
   predestinate, them He also called; and whom He called, them He also
   justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified." [2747]

   You see that martyrdom for love's sake is taught. And should you wish
   to be a martyr for the recompense of advantages, you shall hear again.
   "For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what
   a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see
   not, then do we with patience wait for it." [2748] "But if we also
   suffer for righteousness' sake," says Peter, "blessed are we. Be not
   afraid of their fear, neither be troubled. But sanctify the Lord God in
   your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to him that asks a
   reason of the hope that is in you, but with meekness and fear, having a
   good conscience; so that in reference to that for which you are spoken
   against, they may be ashamed who calumniate your good conversation in
   Christ. For it is better to suffer for well-doing, if the will of God,
   than for evil-doing." But if one should captiously say, And how is it
   possible for feeble flesh to resist the energies and spirits of the
   Powers? [2749] well, let him know this, that, confiding in the Almighty
   and the Lord, we war against the principalities of darkness, and
   against death. "Whilst thou art yet speaking," He says, "Lo, here am
   I." See the invincible Helper who shields us. "Think it not strange,
   therefore, concerning the burning sent for your trial, as though some
   strange thing happened to you; But, as you are partaken in the
   sufferings of Christ, rejoice; that at the revelation of His glory ye
   may rejoice exultant. If ye be reproached in the name of Christ, happy
   are ye; for the Spirit of glory and of God resteth on you." [2750] As
   it is written, "Because for Thy sake we are killed all the day long; we
   are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we
   are more than conquerors, through Him that loved us." [2751]


   "What you wish to ascertain from my mind,

   You shall not ascertain, not were you to apply

   Horrid saws from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet,

   Not were you to load me with chains,"

   says a woman acting manfully in the tragedy. And Antigone, contemning
   the proclamation of Creon, says boldly:--


   "It was not Zeus who uttered this proclamation."

   But it is God that makes proclamation to us, and He must be believed.
   "For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the
   mouth confession is made unto salvation. Wherefore the Scripture saith,
   "Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be put to shame." [2752]
   Accordingly Simonides justly writes, "It is said that virtue dwells
   among all but inaccessible rocks, but that she speedily traverses a
   pure place. Nor is she visible to the eyes of all mortals. He who is
   not penetrated by heart-vexing sweat will not scale the summit of
   manliness." And Pindar says:--


   "But the anxious thoughts of youths, revolving with toils,

   Will find glory: and in time their deeds

   Will in resplendent ether splendid shine."

   Æschylus, too, having grasped this thought, says:--


   "To him who toils is due,

   As product of his toil, glory from the gods."

   "For great Fates attain great destinies," according to Heraclitus:--


   "And what slave is there, who is careless of death?"

   "For God hath not given us the spirit of bondage again to fear; but of
   power, and love, and of a sound mind. Be not therefore ashamed of the
   testimony of our Lord, or of me his prisoner," he writes to Timothy.
   [2753] Such shall he be "who cleaves to that which is good," according
   to the apostle, [2754] "who hates evil, having love unfeigned; for he
   that loveth another fulfilleth the law." [2755] If, then, this God, to
   whom we bear witness, be as He is, the God of hope, we acknowledge our
   hope, speeding on to hope, "saturated with goodness, filled with all
   knowledge." [2756]

   The Indian sages say to Alexander of Macedon: "You transport men's
   bodies from place to place. But you shall not force our souls to do
   what we do not wish. Fire is to men the greatest torture, this we
   despise." Hence Heraclitus preferred one thing, glory, to all else; and
   professes "that he allows the crowd to stuff themselves to satiety like
   cattle."


   "For on account of the body are many toils,

   For it we have invented a roofed house,

   And discovered how to dig up silver, and sow the land,

   And all the rest which we know by names."

   To the multitude, then, this vain labour is desirable. But to us the
   apostle says, "Now we know this, that our old man is crucified with
   Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should
   not serve sin." [2757] Does not the apostle then plainly add the
   following, to show the contempt for faith in the case of the multitude?
   "For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as appointed
   to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to
   men. Up to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked,
   and are beaten, and are feeble, and labour, working with our hands.
   Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; being defamed, we
   entreat; we are become as it were the offscourings of the world."
   [2758] Such also are the words of Plato in the Republic: [2759] "The
   just man, though stretched on the rack, though his eyes are dug out,
   will be happy." The Gnostic will never then have the chief end placed
   in life, but in being always happy and blessed, and a kingly friend of
   God. Although visited with ignominy and exile, and confiscation, and
   above all, death, he will never be wrenched from his freedom, and
   signal love to God. "The charity which bears all things, endures all
   things," [2760] is assured that Divine Providence orders all things
   well. "I exhort you," therefore it is said, "Be followers of me." The
   first step to salvation [2761] is the instruction accompanied with
   fear, in consequence of which we abstain from what is wrong; and the
   second is hope, by reason of which we desire the best things; but love,
   as is fitting, perfects, by training now according to knowledge. For
   the Greeks, I know not how, attributing events to unreasoning
   necessity, own that they yield to them unwillingly. Accordingly
   Euripides says:--


   "What I declare, receive from me, madam:

   No mortal exists who has not toil;

   He buries children, and begets others,

   And he himself dies. And thus mortals are afflicted."

   Then he adds:--


   "We must bear those things which are inevitable according to nature,
   and go through them:

   Not one of the things which are necessary is formidable for mortals."

   And for those who are aiming at perfection there is proposed the
   rational gnosis, the foundation of which is "the sacred Triad." "Faith,
   hope, love; but the greatest of these is love." [2762] Truly, "all
   things are lawful, but all things are not expedient," says the apostle:
   "all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not." [2763] And,
   "Let no one seek his own advantage, but also that of his neighbour,"
   [2764] so as to be able at once to do and to teach, building and
   building up. For that "the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness
   thereof," is admitted; but the conscience of the weak is supported.
   "Conscience, I say, not his own, but that of the other; for why is my
   liberty judged of by another conscience? For if I by grace am partaker,
   why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? Whether
   therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
   God." [2765] "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the
   flesh; for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
   through God to the demolition of fortifications, demolishing thoughts,
   and every high thing which exalteth itself against the knowledge of
   Christ." [2766] Equipped with these weapons, the Gnostic says: O Lord,
   give opportunity, and receive demonstration; let this dread event pass;
   I contemn dangers for the love I bear to Thee.


   "Because alone of human things

   Virtue receives not a recompense from without,

   But has itself as the reward of its toils."

   "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
   mercies, kindness, humbleness, meekness, long-suffering. And above all
   these, love, which is the bond of perfection. And let the peace of God
   reign in your hearts, to which also ye are called in one body; and be
   thankful," [2767] ye who, while still in the body, like the just men of
   old, enjoy impassibility and tranquillity of soul.

   Since, then, not only the Æsopians, and Macedonians, and the
   Lacedæmonians endured when subjected to torture, as Eratosthenes says
   in his work, On Things Good and Evil; but also Zeno of Elea, when
   subjected to compulsion to divulge a secret, held out against the
   tortures, and confessed nothing; who, when expiring, bit out his tongue
   and spat it at the tyrant, whom some term Nearchus, and some Demulus.
   Theodotus the Pythagorean acted also similarly, and Paulus the friend
   of Lacydes, as Timotheus of Pergamus says in his work on The Fortitude
   of Philosophers, and Achaicus in The Ethics. Posthumus also, the Roman,
   when captured by Peucetion, did not divulge a single secret; but
   putting his hand on the fire, held it to it as if to a piece of brass,
   without moving a muscle of his face. I omit the case of Anaxarchus, who
   exclaimed, "Pound away at the sack which holds Anaxarchus, for it is
   not Anaxarchus you are pounding," when by the tyrant's orders he was
   being pounded with iron pestles. Neither, then, the hope of happiness
   nor the love of God takes what befalls ill, but remains free, although
   thrown among the wildest beasts or into the all-devouring fire; though
   racked with a tyrant's tortures. Depending as it does on the divine
   favour, it ascends aloft unenslaved, surrendering the body to those who
   can touch it alone. A barbarous nation, not cumbered with philosophy,
   select, it is said, annually an ambassador to the hero Zamolxis.
   Zamolxis was one of the disciples of Pythagoras. The one, then, who is
   judged of the most sterling worth is put to death, to the distress of
   those who have practiced philosophy, but have not been selected, at
   being reckoned unworthy of a happy service.

   So the Church is full of those, as well chaste women as men, who all
   their life have contemplated the death which rouses up to Christ.
   [2768] For the individual whose life is framed as ours is, may
   philosophize without Learning, whether barbarian, whether Greek,
   whether slave--whether an old man, or a boy, or a woman. [2769] For
   self-control is common to all human beings who have made choice of it.
   And we admit that the same nature exists in every race, and the same
   virtue. As far as respects human nature, the woman does not possess one
   nature, and the man exhibit another, but the same: so also with virtue.
   If, consequently, a self-restraint and righteousness, and whatever
   qualities are regarded as following them, is the virtue of the male, it
   belongs to the male alone to be virtuous, and to the woman to be
   licentious and unjust. But it is offensive even to say this.
   Accordingly woman is to practice self-restraint and righteousness, and
   every other virtue, as well as man, both bond and free; since it is a
   fit consequence that the same nature possesses one and the same virtue.
   [2770] We do not say that woman's nature is the same as man's, as she
   is woman. For undoubtedly it stands to reason that some difference
   should exist between each of them, in virtue of which one is male and
   the other female. Pregnancy and parturition, accordingly, we say belong
   to woman, as she is woman, and not as she is a human being. But if
   there were no difference between man and woman, both would do and
   suffer the same things. As then there is sameness, as far as respects
   the soul, she will attain to the same virtue; but as there is
   difference as respects the peculiar construction of the body, she is
   destined for child-bearing and housekeeping. "For I would have you
   know," says the apostle, "that the head of every man is Christ; and the
   head of the woman is the man: for the man is not of the woman, but the
   woman of the man. For neither is the woman without the man, nor the man
   without the woman, in the Lord." [2771] For as we say that the man
   ought to be continent, and superior to pleasures; so also we reckon
   that the woman should be continent and practiced in fighting against
   pleasures. "But I say, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
   lusts of the flesh," counsels the apostolic command; "for the flesh
   lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh. These,
   then, are contrary" (not as good to evil, but as fighting
   advantageously), he adds therefore, so that ye cannot do the things
   that ye would. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are,
   fornication uncleanness, profligacy, idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities,
   strifes, jealousies, wrath, contentions, dissensions, heresies,
   envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I tell you
   before, as I have also said before, that they which do such things
   shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is
   love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, temperance, goodness,
   faith, meekness." [2772] He calls sinners, as I think, "flesh," and the
   righteous "spirit." Further, manliness is to be assumed in order to
   produce confidence and forbearance, so as "to him that strikes on the
   one cheek, to give to him the other; and to him that takes away the
   cloak, to yield to him the coat also," strongly, restraining anger. For
   we do not train our women like Amazons to manliness in war; since we
   wish the men even to be peaceable. I hear that the Sarmatian women
   practice war no less than the men; and the women of the Sacæ besides,
   who shoot backwards, feigning flight as well as the men. I am aware,
   too, that the women near Iberia practice manly work and toil, not
   refraining from their tasks even though near their delivery; but even
   in the very struggle of her pains, the woman, on being delivered,
   taking up the infant, carries it home. Further, the females no less
   than the males manage the house, and hunt, and keep the flocks:--


   "Cressa the hound ran keenly in the stag's track."

   Women are therefore to philosophize equally with men, though the males
   are preferable at everything, unless they have become effeminate.
   [2773] To the whole human race, then, discipline and virtue are a
   necessity, if they would pursue after happiness. And how recklessly
   Euripides writes sometimes this and sometimes that! On one occasion,
   "For every wife is inferior to her husband, though the most excellent
   one marry her that is of fair fame." And on another:--


   "For the chaste is her husband's slave,

   While she that is unchaste in her folly despises her consort.

   .  .  .  .  For nothing is better and more excellent,

   Than when as husband and wife ye keep house,

   Harmonious in your sentiments."

   The ruling power is therefore the head. And if "the Lord is head of the
   man, and the man is head of the woman," the man, "being the image and
   glory of God, is lord of the woman." [2774] Wherefore also in the
   Epistle to the Ephesians it is written, "Subjecting yourselves one to
   another in the fear of God. Wives, submit yourselves to your own
   husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife, as also
   Christ is the head of the Church; and He is the Saviour of the body.
   Husbands, love your wives, as also Christ loved the Church. So also
   ought men to love their wives as their own bodies: he that loveth his
   wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh." [2775]
   And in that to the Colossians it is said, "Wives, submit yourselves to
   your own husbands, as is fit in the Lord. [2776] Husbands, love your
   wives, and be not bitter against them. Children, obey your parents in
   all things; for this is well pleasing to the Lord. Fathers, provoke not
   your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. Servants, be obedient
   in all things to those who are your masters according to the flesh; not
   with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but with singleness of heart,
   fearing the Lord. And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as serving the
   Lord and not men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward
   of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer
   shall receive the wrong, which he hath done; and there is no respect of
   persons. Masters, render to your servants justice and equity; knowing
   that ye also have a Master in heaven, where there is neither Greek nor
   Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond, free:
   but Christ is all, and in all." [2777] And the earthly Church is the
   image of the heavenly, as we pray also "that the will of God may be
   done upon the earth as in heaven." [2778] "Putting on, therefore,
   bowels of mercy, gentleness, humbleness, meekness, long-suffering;
   forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if one have a
   quarrel against any man; as also Christ hath forgiven us, so also let
   us. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of
   perfectness. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which ye
   are called in one body; and be thankful." [2779] For there is no
   obstacle to adducing frequently the same Scripture in order to put
   Marcion [2780] to the blush, if perchance he be persuaded and
   converted; by learning that the faithful ought to be grateful to God
   the Creator, who hath called us, and who preached the Gospel in the
   body. From these considerations the unity of the faith is clear, and it
   is shown who is the perfect man; so that though some are reluctant, and
   offer as much resistance as they can, though menaced with punishments
   at the hand of husband or master, both the domestic and the wife will
   philosophize. Moreover, the free, though threatened with death at a
   tyrant's hands, and brought before the tribunals, and all his
   substances imperilled, will by no means abandon piety; nor will the
   wife who dwells with a wicked husband, or the son if he has a bad
   father, or the domestic if he has a bad master, ever fail in holding
   nobly to virtue. But as it is noble for a man to die for virtue, and
   for liberty, and for himself, so also is it for a woman. For this is
   not peculiar to the nature of males, but to the nature of the good.
   Accordingly, both the old man, the young, and the servant will live
   faithfully, and if need be die; which will be to be made alive by
   death. So we know that both children, and women, and servants have
   often, against their fathers', and masters', and husbands' will,
   reached the highest degree of excellence. Wherefore those who are
   determined to live piously ought none the less to exhibit alacrity,
   when some seem to exercise compulsion on them; but much more, I think,
   does it become them to show eagerness, and to strive with uncommon
   vigour, lest, being overcome, they abandon the best and most
   indispensable counsels. For it does not, I think, admit of comparison,
   whether it be better to be a follower of the Almighty than to choose
   the darkness of demons. For the things which are done by us on account
   of others we are to do always, endeavouring to have respect to those
   for whose sake it is proper that they be done, regarding the
   gratification rendered in their case, as what is to be our rule; but
   the things which are done for our own sake rather than that of others,
   are to be done with equal earnestness, whether they are like to please
   certain people or not. If some indifferent things have obtained such
   honour as to appear worthy of adoption, though against the will of
   some; much more is virtue to be regarded by us as worth contending for,
   looking the while to nothing but what can be rightly done, whether it
   seem good to others or not. Well then, Epicurus, writing to Menoeceus,
   says, "Let not him who is young delay philosophizing, and let not the
   old man grow weary of philosophizing; for no one is either not of age
   or past age for attending to the health of his soul. And he who says
   that the time for philosophizing is not come or is past, is like the
   man who says that the time for happiness is not come or has gone. So
   that young [2781] as well as old ought to philosophize: the one, in
   order that, while growing old, he may grow young in good things out of
   favour accruing from what is past; and the other, that he may be at
   once young and old, from want of fear for the future."

      Chapter IX.--Christ's Sayings Respecting Martyrdom.

   On martyrdom the Lord hath spoken explicitly, and what is written in
   different places we bring together. "But I say unto you, Whosoever
   shall confess in Me before men, the Son of man also shall confess
   before the angels of God; but whosoever shall deny Me before men, him
   will I deny before the angels." [2782] "Whosoever shall be ashamed of
   Me or of My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him
   shall the Son of man also be ashamed when He cometh in the glory of His
   Father with His angels. Whosoever therefore shall confess in Me before
   men, him will I also confess before my Father in heaven. [2783] "And
   when they bring you before synagogues, and rulers, and powers, think
   not beforehand how ye shall make your defence, or what ye shall say.
   For the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye must say."
   [2784] In explanation of this passage, Heracleon, the most
   distinguished of the school of Valentinians, says expressly, "that
   there is a confession by faith and conduct, and one with the voice. The
   confession that is made with the voice, and before the authorities, is
   what the most reckon the only confession. Not soundly: and hypocrites
   also can confess with this confession. But neither will this utterance
   be found to be spoken universally; for all the saved have confessed
   with the confession made by the voice, and departed. [2785] Of whom are
   Matthew, Philip, Thomas, Levi, and many others. And confession by the
   lip is not universal, but partial. But that which He specifies now is
   universal, that which is by deeds and actions corresponding to faith in
   Him. This confession is followed by that which is partial, that before
   the authorities, if necessary, and reason dictate. For he will confess
   rightly with his voice who has first confessed by his disposition.
   [2786] And he has well used, with regard to those who confess, the
   expression in Me,' and applied to those who deny the expression Me.'
   For those, though they confess Him with the voice, yet deny Him, not
   confessing Him in their conduct. But those alone confess in Him,' who
   live in the confession and conduct according to Him, in which He also
   confesses, who is contained in them and held by them. Wherefore He
   never can deny Himself.' And those deny Him who are not in Him. For He
   said not, Whosoever shall deny' in Me, but Me.' For no one who is in
   Him will ever deny Him. And the expression before men' applies both to
   the saved and the heathen similarly by conduct before the one, and by
   voice before the other. Wherefore they never can deny Him. But those
   deny Him who are not in Him." So far Heracleon. And in other things he
   seems to be of the same sentiments with us in this section; but he has
   not adverted to this, that if some have not by conduct and in their
   life "confessed Christ before men," they are manifested to have
   believed with the heart; by confessing Him with the mouth at the
   tribunals, and not denying Him when tortured to the death. And the
   disposition being confessed, and especially not being changed by death
   at any time, cuts away all passions which were engendered by corporeal
   desire. For there is, so to speak, at the close of life a sudden
   repentance in action, and a true confession toward Christ, in the
   testimony of the voice. But if the Spirit of the Father testifies in
   us, how can we be any more hypocrites, who are said to bear testimony
   with the voice alone? But it will be given to some, if expedient, to
   make a defence, that by their witness and confession all may be
   benefited--those in the Church being confirmed, and those of the
   heathen who have devoted themselves to the search after salvation
   wondering and being led to the faith; and the rest seized with
   amazement. So that confession is by all means necessary. [2787] For it
   is in our power. But to make a defence for our faith is not universally
   necessary. For that does not depend on us. "But he that endureth to the
   end shall be saved." For who of those who are wise would not choose to
   reign in God, and even to serve? So some "confess that they know God,"
   according to the apostle; "but in works they deny Him, being abominable
   and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate." [2788] And these,
   though they confess nothing but this, will have done at the end one
   good work. Their witness, then, appears to be the cleansing away of
   sins with glory. For instance, the Shepherd [2789] says: "You will
   escape the energy of the wild beast, if your heart become pure and
   blameless." Also the Lord Himself says: "Satan hath desired to sift
   you; but I have prayed." [2790] Alone, therefore, the Lord, for the
   purification of the men who plotted against Him and disbelieved Him,
   "drank the cup;" in imitation of whom the apostles, that they might be
   in reality Gnostics, and perfect, suffered for the Churches which they
   founded. So, then, also the Gnostics who tread in the footsteps of the
   apostles ought to be sinless, and, out of love to the Lord, to love
   also their brother; so that, if occasion call, enduring without
   stumbling, afflictions for the Church, "they may drink the cup." Those
   who witness in their life by deed, and at the tribunal by word, whether
   entertaining hope or surmising fear, are better than those who confess
   salvation by their mouth alone. But if one ascend also to love, he is a
   really blessed and true martyr, having confessed perfectly both to the
   commandments and to God, by the Lord; whom having loved, he
   acknowledged a brother, giving himself up wholly for God, resigning
   pleasantly and lovingly the man when asked, like a deposit. [2791]

      Chapter X.--Those Who Offered Themselves for Martyrdom Reproved.

   When, again, He says, "When they persecute you in this city, flee ye to
   the other," [2792] He does not advise flight, as if persecution were an
   evil thing; nor does He enjoin them by flight to avoid death, as if in
   dread of it, but wishes us neither to be the authors nor abettors of
   any evil to any one, either to ourselves or the persecutor and
   murderer. For He, in a way, bids us take care of ourselves. But he who
   disobeys is rash and foolhardy. If he who kills a man of God sins
   against God, he also who presents himself before the judgment-seat
   becomes guilty of his death. And such is also the case with him who
   does not avoid persecution, but out of daring presents himself for
   capture. Such a one, as far as in him lies, becomes an accomplice in
   the crime of the persecutor. And if he also uses provocation, he is
   wholly guilty, challenging the wild beast. And similarly, if he afford
   any cause for conflict or punishment, or retribution or enmity, he
   gives occasion for persecution. Wherefore, then, we are enjoined not to
   cling to anything that belongs to this life; but "to him that takes our
   cloak to give our coat," not only that we may continue destitute of
   inordinate affection, but that we may not by retaliating make our
   persecutors savage against ourselves, and stir them up to blaspheme the
   name. [2793]

      Chapter XI.--The Objection, Why Do You Suffer If God Cares for You,
      Answered.

   But, say they, if God cares for you, why are you persecuted and put to
   death? Has He delivered you to this? No, we do not suppose that the
   Lord wishes us to be involved in calamities, but that He foretold
   prophetically what would happen--that we should be persecuted for His
   name's sake, slaughtered, and impaled. So that it was not that He
   wished us to be persecuted, but He intimated beforehand what we shall
   suffer by the prediction of what would take place, training us to
   endurance, to which He promised the inheritance, although we are
   punished not alone, but along with many. But those, it is said, being
   malefactors, are righteously punished. Accordingly, they unwillingly
   bear testimony to our righteousness, we being unjustly punished for
   righteousness' sake. But the injustice of the judge does not affect the
   providence of God. For the judge must be master of his own opinion--not
   pulled by strings, like inanimate machines, set in motion only by
   external causes. Accordingly he is judged in respect to his judgment,
   as we also, in accordance with our choice of things desirable, and our
   endurance. Although we do not wrong, yet the judge looks on us as doing
   wrong, for he neither knows nor wishes to know about us, but is
   influenced by unwarranted prejudice; wherefore also he is judged.
   [2794] Accordingly they persecute us, not from the supposition that we
   are wrong-doers, but imagining that by the very fact of our being
   Christians we sin against life in so conducting ourselves, and
   exhorting others to adopt the like life.

   But why are you not helped when persecuted? say they. What wrong is
   done us, as far as we are concerned, in being released by death to go
   to the Lord, and so undergoing a change of life, as if a change from
   one time of life to another? Did we think rightly, we should feel
   obliged to those who have afforded the means for speedy departure, if
   it is for love that we bear witness; and if not, we should appear to
   the multitude to be base men. Had they also known the truth, all would
   have bounded on to the way, and there would have been no choice. But
   our faith, being the light of the world, reproves unbelief. "Should
   Anytus and Melitus kill me, they will not hurt me in the least; for I
   do not think it right for the better to be hurt by the worse," [says
   Socrates]. So that each one of us may with confidence say, "The Lord is
   my helper; I will not fear: what shall man do to me?" [2795] "For the
   souls of the righteous are in the hand of the Lord, and no plague shall
   touch them." [2796]

      Chapter XII.--Basilides' Idea of Martyrdom Refuted.

   Basilides, in the twenty-third book of the Exegetics, respecting those
   that are punished by martyrdom, expresses himself in the following
   language: "For I say this, Whosoever fall under the afflictions
   mentioned, in consequence of unconsciously transgressing in other
   matters, are brought to this good end by the kindness of Him who brings
   them, but accused on other grounds; so that they may not suffer as
   condemned for what are owned to be iniquities, nor reproached as the
   adulterer or the murderer, but because they are Christians; which will
   console them, so that they do not appear to suffer. And if one who has
   not sinned at all incur suffering--a rare case--yet even he will not
   suffer aught through the machinations of power, but will suffer as the
   child which seems not to have sinned would suffer." Then further on he
   adds: "As, then, the child which has not sinned before, or committed
   actual sin in itself, but has that which committed sin, when subjected
   to suffering, gets good, reaping the advantage of many difficulties; so
   also, although a perfect man may not have sinned in act, while he
   endures afflictions, he suffers similarly with the child. Having within
   him the sinful principle, but not embracing the opportunity of
   committing sin, he does not sin; so that he is not to be reckoned as
   not having sinned. For as he who wishes to commit adultery is an
   adulterer, although he does not succeed in committing adultery; and he
   that wishes to commit murder is a murderer, although he is unable to
   kill; so also, if I see the man without sin, whom I specify, suffering,
   though he have done nothing bad, I should call him bad, on account of
   his wishing to sin. For I will affirm anything rather than call
   Providence evil." Then, in continuation, he says expressly concerning
   the Lord, as concerning man: "If then, passing from all these
   observations, you were to proceed to put me to shame by saying,
   perchance impersonating certain parties, This man has then sinned; for
   this man has suffered;--if you permit, I will say, He has not sinned;
   but was like a child suffering. If you were to insist more urgently, I
   would say, That the man you name is man, but that God is righteous:
   "For no one is pure," as one said, from pollution.'" [2797] But the
   hypothesis of Basilides [2798] says that the soul, having sinned before
   in another life, endures punishment in this--the elect soul with honour
   by martyrdom, the other purged by appropriate punishment. How can this
   be true, when the confessing and suffering punishment or not depends on
   ourselves? For in the case of the man who shall deny, Providence, as
   held by Basilides, is done away with. I will ask him, then, in the case
   of a confessor who has been arrested, whether he will confess and be
   punished in virtue of Providence or not? For in the case of denying he
   will not be punished. But if, for the sake of escaping and evading the
   necessity of punishing such an one, he shall say that the destruction
   of those who shall deny is of Providence, he will be a martyr against
   his will. And how any more is it the case, that there is laid up in
   heaven the very glorious recompense to him who has witnessed, for his
   witnessing? If Providence did not permit the sinner to get the length
   of sinning, it is unjust in both cases; both in not rescuing the man
   who is dragged to punishment for righteousness' sake, and in having
   rescued him who wished to do wrong, he having done it as far as
   volition was concerned, but [Providence] having prevented the deed, and
   unjustly favoured the sinner. And how impious, in deifying the devil,
   and in daring to call the Lord a sinful man! For the devil tempting us,
   knowing what we are, but not knowing if we will hold out, but wishing
   to dislodge us from the faith, attempts also to bring us into
   subjection to himself. Which is all that is allowed to him, partly from
   the necessity of saving us, who have taken occasion from the
   commandment, from ourselves; partly for the confusion of him who has
   tempted and failed; for the confirmation of the members of the Church,
   and the conscience of those who admire the constancy [displayed]. But
   if martyrdom be retribution by way of punishment, then also faith and
   doctrine, on account of which martyrdom comes, are co-operators in
   punishment--than which, what other absurdity could be greater? But with
   reference to these dogmas, whether the soul is changed to another body,
   also of the devil, at the proper time mention will be made. But at
   present, to what has been already said, let us add the following: Where
   any more is faith in the retribution of sins committed before martyrdom
   takes place? And where is love to God, which is persecuted and endures
   for the truth? And where is the praise of him who has confessed, or the
   censure of him who has denied? And for what use is right conduct, the
   mortification of the lusts, and the hating of no creature? But if, as
   Basilides himself says, we suppose one part of the declared will of God
   to be the loving of all things because all things bear a relation to
   the whole, and another "not to lust after anything," and a third "not
   to hate anything," by the will of God these also will be punishments,
   which it were impious to think. For neither did the Lord suffer by the
   will of the Father, nor are those who are persecuted persecuted by the
   will of God; since either of two things is the case: either persecution
   in consequence of the will of God is a good thing, or those who decree
   and afflict are guiltless. But nothing is without the will of the Lord
   of the universe. It remains to say that such things happen without the
   prevention of God; for this alone saves both the providence and the
   goodness of God. We must not therefore think that He actively produces
   afflictions (far be it that we should think this!); but we must be
   persuaded that He does not prevent those that cause them, but overrules
   for good the crimes of His enemies: "I will therefore," He says,
   "destroy the wall, and it shall be for treading under foot." [2799]
   Providence being a disciplinary art; [2800] in the case of others for
   each individual's sins, and in the case of the Lord and His apostles
   for ours. To this point says the divine apostle: "For this is the will
   of God, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication:
   that each one of you should know how to possess his vessel in
   sanctification and honour; not in the lust of concupiscence, as the
   Gentiles who know not the Lord: that none of you should overreach or
   take advantage of his brother in any matter; because the Lord is the
   avenger in respect of all such, as we also told you before, and
   testified. For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but to
   holiness. Wherefore he that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who
   hath also given His Holy Spirit to you." [2801] Wherefore the Lord was
   not prohibited from this sanctification of ours. If, then, one of them
   were to say, in reply, that the martyr is punished for sins committed
   before this embodying, and that he will again reap the fruit of his
   conduct in this life, for that such are the arrangements of the [divine
   administration], we shall ask him if the retribution takes place by
   Providence. For if it be not of the divine administration, the economy
   of expiations is gone, and their hypothesis falls to the ground; but if
   expiations are by Providence, punishments are by Providence too. But
   Providence, although it begins, so to speak, to move with the Ruler,
   yet is implanted in substances along with their origin by the God of
   the universe. Such being the case, they must confess either that
   punishment is not just, and those who condemn and persecute the martyrs
   do right, or that persecutions even are wrought by the will of God.
   Labour and fear are not, then, as they say, incident to affairs as rust
   to iron, but come upon the soul through its own will. And on these
   points there is much to say, which will be reserved for future
   consideration, taking them up in due course.

      Chapter XIII.--Valentinian's Vagaries About the Abolition of Death
      Refuted.

   Valentinian, in a homily, writes in these words: "Ye are originally
   immortal, and children of eternal life, and ye would have death
   distributed to you, that ye may spend and lavish it, and that death may
   die in you and by you; for when we dissolve the world, and are not
   yourselves dissolved, ye have dominion over creation and all
   corruption." For he also, similarly with Basilides, supposes a class
   saved by nature, and that this different race has come hither to us
   from above for the abolition of death, and that the origin of death is
   the work of the Creator of the world. Wherefore also he so expounds
   that Scripture, "No man shall see the face of God, and live," as if He
   were the cause of death. Respecting this God, he makes those allusions
   when writing in these expressions: "As much as the image is inferior to
   the living face, so much is the world inferior to the living Æon. What
   is, then, the cause of the image? The majesty of the face, which
   exhibits the figure to the painter, to be honoured by his name; for the
   form is not found exactly to the life, but the name supplies what is
   wanting in the effigy. The invisibility of God co-operates also in
   order to the faith of that which has been fashioned." For the Creator,
   called God and Father, he designated as "Painter," and "Wisdom," whose
   image that which is formed is, to the glory of the invisible One; since
   the things which proceed from a pair are complements, and those which
   proceed from one are images. But since what is seen is no part of Him,
   the soul comes from what is intermediate, which is different; and this
   is the inspiration of the different spirit, and generally what is
   breathed into the soul, which is the image of the spirit. And in
   general, what is said of the Creator, who was made according to the
   image, they say was foretold by a sensible image in the book of Genesis
   respecting the origin of man; and the likeness they transfer to
   themselves, teaching that the addition of the different spirit was
   made; unknown to the Creator. When, then, we treat of the unity of the
   God who is proclaimed in the law, the prophets, and the Gospel, we
   shall also discuss this; for the topic is supreme. [2802] But we must
   advance to that which is urgent. If for the purpose of doing away with
   death the peculiar race has come, it is not Christ who has abolished
   death, unless He also is said to be of the same essence with them. And
   if He abolished it to this end, that it might not touch the peculiar
   race, it is not these, the rivals of the Creator, who breathe into the
   image of their intermediate spirit the life from above--in accordance
   with the principle of their dogma--that abolish death. But should they
   say that this takes place by His mother, [2803] or should they say that
   they, along with Christ, war against death, let them own their secret
   dogma that they have the hardihood to assail the divine power of the
   Creator, by setting to rights His creation, as if they were superior,
   endeavouring to save the vital image which He was not able to rescue
   from corruption. Then the Lord would be superior to God the Creator;
   for the son would never contend with the father, especially among the
   gods. But the point that the Creator of all things, the omnipotent
   Lord, is the Father of the Son, we have deferred till the discussion of
   these points, in which we have undertaken to dispute against the
   heresies, showing that He alone is the God proclaimed by Him.

   But the apostle, writing to us with reference to the endurance of
   afflictions, says, "And this is of God, that it is given to you on
   behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for
   His sake; having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to
   be in me. If there is therefore any consolation in Christ, if any
   comfort of love, if any communion of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
   fulfil ye my joy, that ye may be of the same mind, having the same
   love, unanimous, thinking one thing. And if he is offered on the
   sacrifice and service of faith, joying and rejoicing" [2804] with the
   Philippians, to whom the apostle speaks, calling them "fellow-partakers
   of joy," [2805] how does he say that they are of one soul, and having a
   soul? Likewise, also, writing respecting Timothy and himself, he says,
   "For I have no one like-souled, who will nobly care for your state. For
   all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's." [2806]

   Let not the above-mentioned people, then, call us, by way of reproach,
   "natural men" (psukikoi), nor the Phrygians [2807] either; for these
   now call those who do not apply themselves to the new prophecy "natural
   men" (psukikoi), with whom we shall discuss in our remarks on
   "Prophecy." [2808] The perfect man ought therefore to practice love,
   and thence to haste to the divine friendship, fulfilling the
   commandments from love. And loving one's enemies does not mean loving
   wickedness, or impiety, or adultery, or theft; but the thief, the
   impious, the adulterer, not as far as he sins, and in respect of the
   actions by which he stains the name of man, but as he is a man, and the
   work of God. Assuredly sin is an activity, not an existence: and
   therefore it is not a work of God. Now sinners are called enemies of
   God--enemies, that is, of the commands which they do not obey, as those
   who obey become friends, the one named so from their fellowship, the
   others from their estrangement, which is the result of free choice; for
   there is neither enmity nor sin without the enemy and the sinner. And
   the command "to covet nothing," not as if the things to be desired did
   not belong to us, does not teach us not to entertain desire, as those
   suppose who teach that the Creator is different from the first God, not
   as if creation was loathsome and bad (for such opinions are impious).
   But we say that the things of the world are not our own, not as if they
   were monstrous, not as if they did not belong to God, the Lord of the
   universe, but because we do not continue among them for ever; being, in
   respect of possession, not ours, and passing from one to another in
   succession; but belonging to us, for whom they were made in respect of
   use, so long as it is necessary to continue with them. In accordance,
   therefore, with natural appetite, things disallowed are to be used
   rightly, avoiding all excess and inordinate affection.

      Chapter XIV.--The Love of All, Even of Our Enemies.

   How great also is benignity! "Love your enemies," it is said, "bless
   them who curse you, and pray for them who despitefully use you," [2809]
   and the like; to which it is added, "that ye may be the children of
   your Father who is in heaven," in allusion to resemblance to God.
   Again, it is said, "Agree with thine adversary quickly, whilst thou art
   in the way with him." [2810] The adversary is not the body, as some
   would have it, but the devil, and those assimilated to him, who walks
   along with us in the person of men, who emulate his deeds in this
   earthly life. It is inevitable, then, that those who confess themselves
   to belong to Christ, but find themselves in the midst of the devil's
   works, suffer the most hostile treatment. For it is written, "Lest he
   deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officers
   of Satan's kingdom." "For I am persuaded that neither death," through
   the assault of persecutors, "nor life" in this world, "nor angels," the
   apostate ones, "nor powers" (and Satan's power is the life which he
   chose, for such are the powers and principalities of darkness belonging
   to him), "nor things present," amid which we exist during the time of
   life, as the hope entertained by the soldier, and the merchant's gain,
   "nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature," in consequence of the
   energy proper to a man,--opposes the faith of him who acts according to
   free choice. "Creature" is synonymous with activity, being our work,
   and such activity "shall not be able to separate us from the love of
   God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." [2811] You have got a
   compendious account of the gnostic martyr.

      Chapter XV.--On Avoiding Offence.

   "We know that we all have knowledge"--common knowledge in common
   things, and the knowledge that there is one God. For he was writing to
   believers; whence he adds, "But knowledge (gnosis) is not in all,"
   being communicated to few. And there are those who say that the
   knowledge about things sacrificed to idols is not promulgated among
   all, "lest our liberty prove a stumbling-block to the weak. For by thy
   knowledge he that is weak is destroyed." [2812] Should they say,
   "Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, ought that to be bought?" adding,
   by way of interrogation, "asking no questions," [2813] as if equivalent
   to "asking questions," they give a ridiculous interpretation. For the
   apostle says, "All other things buy out of the shambles, asking no
   questions," with the exception of the things mentioned in the Catholic
   epistle of all the apostles, [2814] "with the consent of the Holy
   Ghost," which is written in the Acts of the Apostles, and conveyed to
   the faithful by the hands of Paul himself. For they intimated "that
   they must of necessity abstain from things offered to idols, and from
   blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication, from which
   keeping themselves, they should do well." It is a different matter,
   then, which is expressed by the apostle: "Have we not power to eat and
   to drink? Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as the rest
   of the apostles, as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas? But we have
   not used this power," he says, "but bear all things, lest we should
   occasion hindrance to the Gospel of Christ;" namely, by bearing about
   burdens, when it was necessary to be untrammelled for all things; or to
   become an example to those who wish to exercise temperance, not
   encouraging each other to eat greedily of what is set before us, and
   not to consort inconsiderately with woman. And especially is it
   incumbent on those entrusted with such a dispensation to exhibit to
   disciples a pure example. "For though I be free from all men, I have
   made myself servant to all," it is said, "that I might gain all. And
   every one that striveth for mastery is temperate in all things." [2815]
   "But the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof." [2816] For
   conscience' sake, then, we are to abstain from what we ought to
   abstain. "Conscience, I say, not his own," for it is endued with
   knowledge, "but that of the other," lest he be trained badly, and by
   imitating in ignorance what he knows not, he become a despiser instead
   of a strong-minded man. "For why is my liberty judged of by another
   conscience? For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of
   for that for which I give thanks? Whatever ye do, do all to the glory
   of God" [2817] --what you are commanded to do by the rule of faith.

      Chapter XVI.--Passages of Scripture Respecting the Constancy, Patience,
      and Love of the Martyrs.

   "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth
   confession is made unto salvation. Wherefore the Scripture saith,
   Whosoever believeth on Him shall not be ashamed; that is, the word of
   faith which we preach: for if thou confess the word with thy mouth that
   Jesus is Lord, and believe in thy heart that God hath raised Him from
   the dead, thou shalt be saved." [2818] There is clearly described the
   perfect righteousness, fulfilled both in practice and contemplation.
   Wherefore we are "to bless those who persecute us. Bless, and curse
   not." [2819] "For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of a good
   conscience, that in holiness and sincerity we know God" by this
   inconsiderable instance exhibiting the work of love, that "not in
   fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation
   in the world." [2820] So far the apostle respecting knowledge; and in
   the second Epistle to the Corinthians he calls the common "teaching of
   faith" the savour of knowledge. "For unto this day the same veil
   remains on many in the reading of the Old Testament," [2821] not being
   uncovered by turning to the Lord. Wherefore also to those capable of
   perceiving he showed resurrection, that of the life still in the flesh,
   creeping on its belly. Whence also he applied the name "brood of
   vipers" to the voluptuous, who serve the belly and the pudenda, and cut
   off one another's heads for the sake of worldly pleasures. "Little
   children, let us not love in word, or in tongue," says John, teaching
   them to be perfect, "but in deed and in truth; hereby shall we know
   that we are of the truth." [2822] And if "God be love," piety also is
   love: "there is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear."
   [2823] "This is the love of God, that we keep His commandments." [2824]
   And again, to him who desires to become a Gnostic, it is written, "But
   be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in love,
   in faith, in purity." [2825] For perfection in faith differs, I think,
   from ordinary faith. And the divine apostle furnishes the rule for the
   Gnostic in these words, writing as follows: "For I have learned, in
   whatsoever state I am, to be content. I know both how to be abased, and
   I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I am instructed both
   to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to lack. I can do all
   things through Him who strengtheneth me." [2826] And also when
   discussing with others in order to put them, to shame, he does not
   shrink from saying, "But call to mind the former days, in which, after
   ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions; partly,
   whilst ye were made a gazing-stock, both by reproaches and afflictions;
   and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used. For
   ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took with joy the spoiling of
   your goods, knowing that you have a better and enduring substance. Cast
   not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of
   reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after doing the will of
   God, ye may obtain the promise. For yet a little while, and He that
   cometh will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith:
   and if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. But we
   are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe
   to the saving of the soul." [2827] He then brings forward a swarm of
   divine examples. For was it not "by faith," he says, this endurance,
   that they acted nobly who "had trial of mockeries and scourgings, and,
   moreover, of bonds and imprisonments? They were stoned, they were
   tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheep-skins
   and goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the
   world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts, in mountains, in dens,
   and caves of the earth. And all having received a good report, through
   faith, received not the promise of God" (what is expressed by a
   parasiopesis is left to be understood, viz., "alone"). He adds
   accordingly, "God having provided some better thing for us (for He was
   good), that they should not without us be made perfect. Wherefore also,
   having encompassing us such a cloud," holy and transparent, "of
   witnesses, laying aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily
   beset us, let us run with patience the race set before us, looking unto
   Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith." [2828] Since, then, he
   specifies one salvation in Christ of the righteous, [2829] and of us he
   has expressed the former unambiguously, and saying nothing less
   respecting Moses, adds, "Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
   riches than the treasures of Egypt: for he had respect to the
   recompense of the reward. By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the
   wrath of the king: for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible."
   [2830] The divine Wisdom says of the martyrs, "They seemed in the eyes
   of the foolish to die, and their departure was reckoned a calamity, and
   their migration from us an affliction. But they are in peace. For
   though in the sight of men they were punished, their hope was full of
   immortality." [2831] He then adds, teaching martyrdom to be a glorious
   purification, "And being chastened a little, they shall be benefited
   much; because God proved them," that is, suffered them to be tried, to
   put them to the proof, and to put to shame the author of their trial,
   "and found them worthy of Himself," plainly to be called sons. "As gold
   in the furnace He proved them, and as a whole burned-offering of
   sacrifice He accepted them. And in the time of their visitation they
   will shine forth, even as sparks run along the stubble. They shall
   judge the nations, and rule over the peoples, and the Lord shall reign
   over them forever." [2832]

      Chapter XVII.--Passages from Clement's Epistle to the Corinthians on
      Martyrdom.

   Moreover, in the Epistle to the Corinthians, the Apostle [2833] Clement
   also, drawing a picture of the Gnostic, says: [2834] "For who that has
   sojourned among you has not proved your perfect and firm faith? and has
   not admired your sound and gentle piety? and has not celebrated the
   munificent style of your hospitality? and has not felicitated your
   complete and sure knowledge? For ye did all things impartially, and
   walked in the ordinances of God;" and so forth.

   Then more clearly: "Let us fix our eyes on those who have yielded
   perfect service to His magnificent glory. Let us take Enoch, who, being
   by his obedience found righteous, was translated; and Noah, who, having
   believed, was saved; and Abraham, who for his faith and hospitality was
   called the friend of God, and was the father of Isaac." "For
   hospitality and piety, Lot was saved from Sodom." "For faith and
   hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved." "From patience and faith they
   walked about in goat-skins, and sheep-skins, and folds of camels' hair,
   proclaiming the kingdom of Christ. We name His prophets Elias, and
   Eliseus, and Ezekiel, and John."

   "For Abraham, who for his free faith was called the friend of God,' was
   not elated by glory, but modestly said, I am dust and ashes.' [2835]
   And of Job it is thus written: Job was just and blameless, true and
   pious, abstaining from all evil.'" [2836] He it was who overcame the
   tempter by patience, and at once testified and was testified to by God;
   who keeps hold of humility, and says, "No one is pure from defilement,
   not even if his life were but for one day." [2837] "Moses, the servant
   who was faithful in all his house,' said to Him who uttered the oracles
   from the bush, Who am I, that Thou sendest me? I am slow of speech, and
   of a stammering tongue,' to minister the voice of God in human speech.
   And again: I am smoke from a pot.'" "For God resisteth the proud, but
   giveth grace to the humble." [2838]

   "David too, of whom the Lord, testifying, says, I found a man after my
   own heart, David the son of Jesse. With my holy oil I anointed him.'
   [2839] But he also says to God, Pity me, O God, according to Thy mercy;
   and according to the multitude of Thy tender mercies, blot out my
   transgression. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me
   from my sin. For I know my transgression, and my sin is ever before
   me.'" [2840] Then, alluding to sin which is not subject to the law, in
   the exercise of the moderation of true knowledge, he adds, "Against
   Thee only have I sinned, and done evil in Thy sight." [2841] For the
   Scripture somewhere says, "The Spirit of the Lord is a lamp, searching
   the recesses of the belly." [2842] And the more of a Gnostic a man
   becomes by doing right, the nearer is the illuminating Spirit to him.
   "Thus the Lord draws near to the righteous, and none of the thoughts
   and reasonings of which we are the authors escape Him--I mean the Lord
   Jesus," the scrutinizer by His omnipotent will of our heart, "whose
   blood was consecrated [2843] for us. Let us therefore respect those who
   are over us, and reverence the elders; let us honour the young, and let
   us teach the discipline of God." For blessed is he who shall do and
   teach the Lord's commands worthily; and he is of a magnanimous mind,
   and of a mind contemplative of truth. "Let us direct our wives to what
   is good; let them exhibit," says he, "the lovable disposition of
   chastity; let them show the guileless will of their meekness; let them
   manifest the gentleness of their tongue by silence; let them give their
   love not according to their inclinations, but equal love in sanctity to
   all that fear God. Let our children share in the discipline that is in
   Christ; let them learn what humility avails before God; what is the
   power of holy love before God, how lovely and great is the fear of the
   Lord, saving all that walk in it holily; with a pure heart: for He is
   the Searcher of the thoughts and sentiments, whose breath is in us, and
   when He wills He will take it away."

   "Now all those things are confirmed by the faith that is in
   Christ.Come, ye children,' says the Lord, hearken to me, and I will
   teach you the fear of the Lord. Who is the man that desireth life, that
   loveth to see good days? ' [2844] Then He subjoins the gnostic mystery
   of the numbers seven and eight.Stop thy tongue from evil, and thy lips
   from speaking guile. Depart from evil, and do good. Seek peace, and
   pursue it.' [2845] For in these words He alludes to knowledge (gnosis),
   with abstinence from evil and the doing of what is good, teaching that
   it is to be perfected by word and deed. The eyes of the Lord are on the
   righteous, and His ears are to their prayer. But the face of God is
   against those that do evil, to root out their memory from the earth.
   The righteous cried, and the Lord heard, and delivered him out of all
   his distresses.' [2846] Many are the stripes of sinners; but those who
   hope in the Lord, mercy shall compass about.'" [2847] "A multitude of
   mercy," he nobly says, "surrounds him that trusts in the Lord."

   For it is written in the Epistle to the Corinthians, "Through Jesus
   Christ our foolish and darkened mind springs up to the light. By Him
   the Sovereign Lord wished us to taste the knowledge that is immortal."
   And, showing more expressly the peculiar nature of knowledge, he added:
   "These things, then, being clear to us, looking into the depths of
   divine knowledge, we ought to do all things in order which the
   Sovereign Lord commanded us to perform at the appointed seasons. Let
   the wise man, then, show his wisdom not in words only, but in good
   deeds. Let the humble not testify to himself, but allow testimony to be
   borne to him by another. Let not him who is pure in the flesh boast,
   knowing that it is another who furnishes him with continence. Ye see,
   brethren, that the more we are subjected to peril, the more knowledge
   are we counted worthy of."

      Chapter XVIII.--On Love, and the Repressing of Our Desires.

   "The decorous tendency of our philanthropy, therefore," according to
   Clement, "seeks the common good;" whether by suffering martyrdom, or by
   teaching by deed and word,--the latter being twofold, unwritten and
   written. This is love, to love God and our neighbour. "This conducts to
   the height which is unutterable. [2848] Love covers a multitude of
   sins. [2849] Love beareth all things, suffereth all things.' [2850]
   Love joins us to God, does all things in concord. In love, all the
   chosen of God were perfected. Apart from love, nothing is well pleasing
   to God." "Of its perfection there is no unfolding," it is said. "Who is
   fit to be found in it, except those whom God counts worthy?" To the
   point the Apostle Paul speaks, "If I give my body, and have not love, I
   am sounding brass, and a tinkling cymbal." [2851] If it is not from a
   disposition determined by gnostic love that I shall testify, he means;
   but if through fear and expected reward, moving my lips in order to
   testify to the Lord that I shall confess the Lord, I am a common man,
   sounding the Lord's name, not knowing Him. "For there is the people
   that loveth with the lips; and there is another which gives the body to
   be burned." "And if I give all my goods in alms," he says, not
   according to the principle of loving communication, but on account of
   recompense, either from him who has received the benefit, or the Lord
   who has promised; "and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains,"
   and cast away obscuring passions, and be not faithful to the Lord from
   love, "I am nothing," as in comparison of him who testifies as a
   Gnostic, and the crowd, and being reckoned nothing better.

   "Now all the generations from Adam to this day are gone. But they who
   have been perfected in love, through the grace of God, hold the place
   of the godly, who shall be manifested at the visitation of the kingdom
   of Christ." Love permits not to sin; but if it fall into any such case,
   by reason of the interference of the adversary, in imitation of David,
   it will sing: "I will confess unto the Lord, and it will please Him
   above a young bullock that has horns and hoofs. Let the poor see it,
   and be glad." For he says, "Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise, and
   pay to the Lord thy vows; and call upon me in the day of trouble, and I
   will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." [2852] "For the
   sacrifice of God is a broken spirit." [2853]

   "God," then, being good, "is love," it is said. [2854] Whose "love
   worketh no ill to his neighbour," [2855] neither injuring nor revenging
   ever, but, in a word, doing good to all according to the image of God.
   "Love is," then, "the fulfilling of the law;" [2856] like as Christ,
   that is the presence of the Lord who loves us; and our loving teaching
   of, and discipline according to Christ. By love, then, the commands not
   to commit adultery, and not to covet one's neighbour's wife, are
   fulfilled, [these sins being] formerly prohibited by fear.

   The same work, then, presents a difference, according as it is done by
   fear, or accomplished by love, and is wrought by faith or by knowledge.
   Rightly, therefore, their rewards are different. To the Gnostic "are
   prepared what eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath entered into
   the heart of man;" but to him who has exercised simple faith He
   testifies a hundredfold in return for what he has left,--a promise
   which has turned out to fall within human comprehension.

   Come to this point, I recollect one who called himself a Gnostic. For,
   expounding the words, "But I say unto you, he that looketh on a woman
   to lust after, hath committed adultery," [2857] he thought that it was
   not bare desire that was condemned; but if through the desire the act
   that results from it proceeding beyond the desire is accomplished in
   it. For dream employs phantasy and the body. Accordingly, the
   historians relate the following decision of Bocchoris the just. [2858]
   A youth, falling in love with a courtezan, persuades the girl, for a
   stipulated reward, to come to him next day. But his desire being
   unexpectedly satiated, by laying hold of the girl in a dream, by
   anticipation, when the object of his love came according to
   stipulation, he prohibited her from coming in. But she, on learning
   what had taken place, demanded the reward, saying that in this way she
   had sated the lover's desire. They came accordingly to the judge. He,
   ordering the youth to hold out the purse containing the reward in the
   sun, bade the courtezan take hold of the shadow; facetiously bidding
   him pay the image of a reward for the image of an embrace.

   Accordingly one dreams, the soul assenting to the vision. But he dreams
   waking, who looks so as to lust; not only, as that Gnostic said, if
   along with the sight of the woman he imagine in his mind intercourse,
   for this is already the act of lust, as lust; but if one looks on
   beauty of person (the Word says), and the flesh seem to him in the way
   of lust to be fair, looking on carnally and sinfully, he is judged
   because he admired. For, on the other hand, he who in chaste love looks
   on beauty, thinks not that the flesh is beautiful, but the spirit,
   admiring, as I judge, the body as an image, by whose beauty he
   transports himself to the Artist, and to the true beauty; exhibiting
   the sacred symbol, the bright impress of righteousness to the angels
   that wait on the ascension; [2859] I mean the unction of acceptance,
   the quality of disposition which resides in the soul that is gladdened
   by the communication of the Holy Spirit. This glory, which shone forth
   on the face of Moses, the people could not look on. Wherefore he took a
   veil for the glory, to those who looked carnally. For those, who demand
   toll, detain those who bring in any worldly things, who are burdened
   with their own passions. But him that is free of all things which are
   subject to duty, and is full of knowledge, and of the righteousness of
   works, they pass on with their good wishes, blessing the man with his
   work. "And his life shall not fall away"--the leaf of the living tree
   that is nourished "by the water-courses." [2860] Now the righteous is
   likened to fruit-bearing trees, and not only to such as are of the
   nature [2861] of tall-growing ones. And in the sacrificial oblations,
   according to the law, there were those who looked for blemishes in the
   sacrifices. They who are skilled in such matters distinguish propension
   [2862] (orexis) from lust (epithumia); and assign the latter, as being
   irrational, to pleasures and licentiousness; and propension, as being a
   rational movement, they assign to the necessities of nature.

      Chap. XIX.--Women as well as Men Capable of Perfection.

   In this perfection it is possible for man and woman equally to share.
   It is not only Moses, then, that heard from God, "I have spoken to thee
   once, and twice, saying, I have seen this people, and lo, it is
   stiff-necked. Suffer me to exterminate them, and blot out their name
   from under heaven; and I will make thee into a great and wonderful
   nation much greater than this;" who answers not regarding himself, but
   the common salvation: "By no means, O Lord; forgive this people their
   sin, or blot me out of the book of the living." [2863] How great was
   his perfection, in wishing to die together with the people, rather than
   be saved alone!

   But Judith too, who became perfect among women, in the siege of the
   city, at the entreaty of the elders went forth into the strangers'
   camp, despising all danger for her country's sake, giving herself into
   the enemy's hand in faith in God; and straightway she obtained the
   reward of her faith,--though a woman, prevailing over the enemy of her
   faith, and gaining possession of the head of Holofernes. And again,
   Esther perfect by faith, who rescued Israel from the power of the king
   and the satrap's cruelty: a woman alone, afflicted with fastings,
   [2864] held back ten thousand armed [2865] hands, annulling by her
   faith the tyrant's decree; him indeed she appeased, Haman she
   restrained, and Israel she preserved scathless by her perfect prayer to
   God. I pass over in silence Susanna and the sister of Moses, since the
   latter was the prophet's associate in commanding the host, being
   superior to all the women among the Hebrews who were in repute for
   their wisdom; and the former in her surpassing modesty, going even to
   death condemned by licentious admirers, remained the unwavering martyr
   of chastity.

   Dion, too, the philosopher, tells that a certain woman Lysidica,
   through excess of modesty, bathed in her clothes; and that Philotera,
   when she was to enter the bath, gradually drew back her tunic as the
   water covered the naked parts; and then rising by degrees, put it on.
   And did not Leæna of Attica manfully bear the torture? She being privy
   to the conspiracy of Harmodius and Aristogeiton against Hipparchus,
   uttered not a word, though severely tortured. And they say that the
   Argolic women, under the guidance of Telesilla the poetess, turned to
   flight the doughty Spartans by merely showing themselves; and that she
   produced in them fearlessness of death. Similarly speaks he who
   composed the Danais respecting the daughters of Danaus:--


   "And then the daughters of Danaus swiftly armed themselves,

   Before the fair-flowing river, majestic Nile [2866] ,"

   and so forth.

   And the rest of the poets sing of Atalanta's swiftness in the chase, of
   Anticlea's love for children, of Alcestis's love for her husband, of
   the courage of Makæria and of the Hyacinthides. What shall I say? Did
   not Theano the Pythagorean make such progress in philosophy, that to
   him who looked intently at her, and said, "Your arm is beautiful," she
   answered "Yes, but it is not public." Characterized by the same
   propriety, there is also reported the following reply. [2867] When
   asked when a woman after being with her husband attends the
   Thesmophoria, said, "From her own husband at once, from a stranger
   never." Themisto too, of Lampsacus, the daughter of Zoilus, the wife of
   Leontes of Lampsacus, studied the Epicurean philosophy, as Myia the
   daughter of Theano the Pythagorean, and Arignote, who wrote the history
   of Dionysius.

   And the daughters of Diodorus, who was called Kronus, all became
   dialecticians, as Philo the dialectician says in the Menexenus, whose
   names are mentioned as follows--Menexene, Argia, Theognis, Artemesia,
   Pantaclea. I also recollect a female Cynic,--she was called Hipparchia,
   a Maronite, the wife of Crates,--in whose case the so-called
   dog-wedding was celebrated in the Poecile. Arete of Cyrene, too, the
   daughter of Aristippus, educated her son Aristippus, who was surnamed
   Mother-taught. Lastheneia of Arcis, and Axiothea of Phlius, studied
   philosophy with Plato. Besides, Aspasia of Miletus, of whom the writers
   of comedy write much, was trained by Socrates in philosophy, by
   Pericles in rhetoric. I omit, on account of the length of the
   discourse, the rest; enumerating neither the poetesses Corinna,
   Telesilla, Myia, and Sappho; nor the painters, as Irene the daughter of
   Cratinus, and Anaxandra the daughter of Nealces, according to the
   account of Didymus in the Symposiaci. The daughter of Cleobulus, the
   sage and monarch of the Lindii, was not ashamed to wash the feet of her
   father's guests. Also the wife of Abraham, the blessed Sarah, in her
   own person prepared the cakes baked in the ashes for the angels; and
   princely maidens among the Hebrews fed sheep. Whence also the Nausicaä
   of Homer went to the washing-tubs.

   The wise woman, then, will first choose to persuade her husband to be
   her associate in what is conducive to happiness. And should that be
   found impracticable, let her by herself earnestly aim at virtue,
   gaining her husband's consent in everything, so as never to do anything
   against his will, with exception of what is reckoned as contributing to
   virtue and salvation. But if one keeps from such a mode of life either
   wife or maid-servant, whose heart is set on it; what such a person in
   that case plainly does is nothing else than determine to drive her away
   from righteousness and sobriety, and to choose to make his own house
   wicked and licentious.

   It is not then possible that man or woman can be conversant with
   anything whatever, without the advantage of education, and application,
   and training; and virtue, we have said, depends not on others, but on
   ourselves above all. Other things one can repress, by waging war
   against them; but with what depends on one's self, this is entirely out
   of the question, even with the most strenuous persistence. For the gift
   is one conferred by God, and not in the power of any other. Whence
   licentiousness should be regarded as the evil of no other one than of
   him who is guilty of licentiousness; and temperance, on the other hand,
   as the good of him who is able to practice it.

      Chapter XX.--A Good Wife.

   The woman who, with propriety, loves her husband, Euripides describes,
   while admonishing,--


   "That when her husband says aught,

   She ought to regard him as speaking well if she say nothing;

   And if she will say anything, to do her endeavour to gratify her
   husband."

   And again he subjoins the like:--


   "And that the wife should sweetly look sad with her husband,

   Should aught evil befall him,

   And have in common a share of sorrow and joy."

   Then, describing her as gentle and kind even in misfortunes, he adds:--


   "And I, when you are ill, will, sharing your sickness bear it;

   And I will bear my share in your misfortunes."

   And:--


   "Nothing is bitter to me,

   For with friends one ought to be happy,

   For what else is friendship but this?"

   The marriage, then, that is consummated according to the word, is
   sanctified, if the union be under subjection to God, and be conducted
   "with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having hearts sprinkled
   from an evil conscience, and the body washed with pure water, and
   holding the confession of hope; for He is faithful that promised." And
   the happiness of marriage ought never to be estimated either by wealth
   or beauty, but by virtue.

   "Beauty," says the tragedy,--


   "Helps no wife with her husband;

   But virtue has helped many; for every good wife

   Who is attached to her husband knows how to practice sobriety."

   Then, as giving admonitions, he says:--


   "First, then, this is incumbent on her who is endowed with mind,

   That even if her husband be ugly, he must appear good-looking;

   For it is for the mind, not the eye, to judge."

   And so forth.

   For with perfect propriety Scripture has said that woman is given by
   God as "an help" to man. It is evident, then, in my opinion, that she
   will charge herself with remedying, by good sense and persuasion, each
   of the annoyances that originate with her husband in domestic economy.
   And if he do not yield, then she will endeavour, as far as possible for
   human nature, to lead a sinless life; whether it be necessary to die,
   in accordance with reason, or to live; considering that God is her
   helper and associate in such a course of conduct, her true defender and
   Saviour both for the present and for the future; making Him the leader
   and guide of all her actions, reckoning sobriety and righteousness her
   work, and making the favour of God her end. Gracefully, therefore, the
   apostle says in the Epistle to Titus, "that the elder women should be
   of godly behaviour, should not be slanderers, not enslaved to much
   wine; that they should counsel the young women to be lovers of their
   husbands, lovers of their children, discreet, chaste, housekeepers,
   good, subject to their own husbands; that the word of God be not
   blasphemed." [2868] But rather, he says, "Follow peace with all men,
   and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: looking
   diligently, lest there be any fornicator or profane person, as Esau,
   who for one morsel surrendered his birth-right; and lest any root of
   bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled."
   [2869] And then, as putting the finishing stroke to the question about
   marriage, he adds: "Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed
   undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge." [2870] And
   one aim and one end, as far as regards perfection, being demonstrated
   to belong to the man and the woman, Peter in his Epistle says, "Though
   now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold
   temptations; that the trial of your faith, being much more precious
   than that of gold which perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might
   be found unto praise, and honour, and glory at the revelation of Jesus
   Christ; whom, having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see Him
   not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory,
   receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls." [2871]
   Wherefore also Paul rejoices for Christ's sake that he was "in labours,
   more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft." [2872]

      Chapter XXI.--Description of the Perfect Man, or Gnostic.

   Here I find perfection apprehended variously in relation to Him who
   excels in every virtue. Accordingly one is perfected as pious, and as
   patient, and as continent, and as a worker, and as a martyr, and as a
   Gnostic. But I know no one of men perfect in all things at once, while
   still human, though according to the mere letter of the law, except Him
   alone who for us clothed Himself with humanity. Who then is perfect? He
   who professes abstinence from what is bad. Well, this is the way to the
   Gospel and to well-doing. But gnostic perfection in the case of the
   legal man is the acceptance of the Gospel, that he that is after the
   law may be perfect. For so he, who was after the law, Moses, foretold
   that it was necessary to hear in order that we might, according to the
   apostle, receive Christ, the fulness of the law. [2873] But now in the
   Gospel the Gnostic attains proficiency not only by making use of the
   law as a step, but by understanding and comprehending it, as the Lord
   who gave the Covenants delivered it to the apostles. And if he conduct
   himself rightly (as assuredly it is impossible to attain knowledge
   (gnosis) by bad conduct); and if, further, having made an eminently
   right confession, he become a martyr out of love, obtaining
   considerable renown as among men; not even thus will he be called
   perfect in the flesh beforehand; since it is the close of life which
   claims this appellation, when the gnostic martyr has first shown the
   perfect work, and rightly exhibited it, and having thankfully shed his
   blood, has yielded up the ghost: blessed then will he be, and truly
   proclaimed perfect, "that the excellency of the power may be of God,
   and not of us," as the apostle says. Only let us preserve free-will and
   love: "troubled on every side, yet not distressed; perplexed, but not
   in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
   destroyed." [2874] For those who strive after perfection, according to
   the same apostle, must "give no offence in anything, but in everything
   approve themselves not to men, but to God." And, as a consequence, also
   they ought to yield to men; for it is reasonable, on account of abusive
   calumnies. Here is the specification: "in much patience, in
   afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in
   imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, in
   pureness, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in the Holy
   Ghost, in love unfeigned, in the word of truth, in the power of God,"
   [2875] that we may be the temples of God, purified "from all filthiness
   of the flesh and of the spirit." "And I," He says, "will receive you;
   and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to Me for sons and
   daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." [2876] "Let us then," he says,
   "perfect holiness in the fear of God." For though fear beget pain, "I
   rejoice," he says, "not that ye were made sorry, but that ye showed
   susceptibility to repentance. For ye sorrowed after a godly sort, that
   ye might receive damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow worketh
   repentance unto salvation not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the
   world worketh death. For this same thing that ye sorrowed after a godly
   sort, what earnestness it wrought in you; yea, what clearing of
   yourselves; yea, what compunction; yea, what fear; yea, what desire;
   yea, what zeal; yea, revenge! In all things ye have showed yourselves
   clear in the matter." [2877] Such are the preparatory exercises of
   gnostic discipline. And since the omnipotent God Himself "gave some
   apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some pastors and
   teachers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
   ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all attain to
   the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a
   perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ;"
   [2878] we are then to strive to reach manhood as befits the Gnostic,
   and to be as perfect as we can while still abiding in the flesh, making
   it our study with perfect concord here to concur with the will of God,
   to the restoration of what is the truly perfect nobleness and
   relationship, to the fulness of Christ, that which perfectly depends on
   our perfection.

   And now we perceive where, and how, and when the divine apostle
   mentions the perfect man, and how he shows the differences of the
   perfect. And again, on the other hand: "The manifestation of the Spirit
   is given for our profit. For to one is given the word of wisdom by the
   Spirit; to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
   to another faith through the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
   healing through the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to
   another prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another
   diversities of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: and
   all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, distributing to each one
   according as He wills." [2879] Such being the case, the prophets are
   perfect in prophecy, the righteous in righteousness, and the martyrs in
   confession, and others in preaching, not that they are not sharers in
   the common virtues, but are proficient in those to which they are
   appointed. For what man in his senses would say that a prophet was not
   righteous? For what? did not righteous men like Abraham prophesy?


   "For to one God has given warlike deeds,

   To another the accomplishment of the dance,

   To another the lyre and song," [2880]

   says Homer. "But each has his own proper gift of God" [2881] --one in
   one way, another in another. But the apostles were perfected in all.
   You will find, then, if you choose, in their acts and writings,
   knowledge, life, preaching, righteousness, purity, prophecy. We must
   know, then, that if Paul is young in respect to time [2882] --having
   flourished immediately after the Lord's ascension--yet his writings
   depend on the Old Testament, breathing and speaking of them. For faith
   in Christ and the knowledge of the Gospel are the explanation and
   fulfilment of the law; and therefore it was said to the Hebrews, "If ye
   believe not, neither shall you understand;" [2883] that is, unless you
   believe what is prophesied in the law, and oracularly delivered by the
   law, you will not understand the Old Testament, which He by His coming
   expounded.

      Chapter XXII.--The True Gnostic Does Good, Not from Fear of Punishment or
      Hope of Reward, But Only for the Sake of Good Itself.

   The man of understanding and perspicacity is, then, a Gnostic. And his
   business is not abstinence from what is evil (for this is a step to the
   highest perfection), or the doing of good out of fear. For it is
   written, "Whither shall I flee, and where shall I hide myself from Thy
   presence? If I ascend into heaven, Thou art there; if I go away to the
   uttermost parts of the sea, there is Thy right hand; if I go down into
   the depths, there is Thy Spirit." [2884] Nor any more is he to do so
   from hope of promised recompense. For it is said, "Behold the Lord, and
   His reward is before His face, to give to every one according to his
   works; what eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, and hath not
   entered into the heart of man what God hath prepared for them that love
   Him." [2885] But only the doing of good out of love, and for the sake
   of its own excellence, is to be the Gnostic's choice. Now, in the
   person of God it is said to the Lord, "Ask of Me, and I will give the
   heathen for Thine inheritance;" [2886] teaching Him to ask a truly
   regal request--that is, the salvation of men without price, that we may
   inherit and possess the Lord. For, on the contrary, to desire knowledge
   about God for any practical purpose, that this may be done, or that may
   not be done, is not proper to the Gnostic; but the knowledge itself
   suffices as the reason for contemplation. For I will dare aver that it
   is not because he wishes to be saved that he, who devotes himself to
   knowledge for the sake of the divine science itself, chooses knowledge.
   For the exertion of the intellect by exercise is prolonged to a
   perpetual exertion. And the perpetual exertion of the intellect is the
   essence of an intelligent being, which results from an uninterrupted
   process of admixture, and remains eternal contemplation, a living
   substance. Could we, then, suppose any one proposing to the Gnostic
   whether he would choose the knowledge of God or everlasting salvation;
   and if these, which are entirely identical, were separable, he would
   without the least hesitation choose the knowledge of God, deeming that
   property of faith, which from love ascends to knowledge, desirable, for
   its own sake. This, then, is the perfect man's first form of doing
   good, when it is done not for any advantage in what pertains to him,
   but because he judges it right to do good; and the energy being
   vigorously exerted in all things, in the very act becomes good; not,
   good in some things, and not good in others; but consisting in the
   habit of doing good, neither for glory, nor, as the philosophers say,
   for reputation, nor from reward either from men or God; but so as to
   pass life after the image and likeness of the Lord.

   And if, in doing good, he be met with anything adverse, he will let the
   recompense pass without resentment as if it were good, he being just
   and good "to the just and the unjust." To such the Lord says, "Be ye,
   as your Father is perfect."

   To him the flesh is dead; but he himself lives alone, having
   consecrated the sepulchre into a holy temple to the Lord, having turned
   towards God the old sinful soul.

   Such an one is no longer continent, but has reached a state of
   passionlessness, waiting to put on the divine image. "If thou doest
   alms," it is said, "let no one know it; and if thou fastest, anoint
   thyself, that God alone may know," [2887] and not a single human being.
   Not even he himself who shows mercy ought to know that he does show
   mercy; for in this way he will be sometimes merciful, sometimes not.
   And when he shall do good by habit, he will imitate the nature of good,
   and his disposition will be his nature and his practice. There is no
   necessity for removing those who are raised on high, but there is
   necessity for those who are walking to reach the requisite goal, by
   passing over the whole of the narrow way. For this is to be drawn by
   the Father, to become worthy to receive the power of grace from God, so
   as to run without hindrance. And if some hate the elect, such an one
   knows their ignorance, and pities their minds for its folly.

   As is right, then, knowledge itself loves and teaches the ignorant, and
   instructs the whole creation to honour God Almighty. And if such an one
   teaches to love God, he will not hold virtue as a thing to be lost in
   any case, either awake or in a dream, or in any vision; since the habit
   never goes out of itself by falling from being a habit. Whether, then,
   knowledge be said to be habit or disposition; on account of diverse
   sentiments never obtaining access, the guiding faculty, remaining
   unaltered, admits no alteration of appearances by framing in dreams
   visionary conceptions out of its movements by day. Wherefore also the
   Lord enjoins "to watch," so that our soul may never be perturbed with
   passion, even in dreams; but also to keep the life of the night pure
   and stainless, as if spent in the day. For assimilation to God, as far
   as we can, is preserving the mind in its relation to the same things.
   And this is the relation of mind as mind.

   But the variety of disposition arises from inordinate affection to
   material things. And for this reason, as they appear to me, to have
   called night Euphrone; since then the soul, released from the
   perceptions of sense, turns in on itself, and has a truer hold of
   intelligence (phronesis). [2888] Wherefore the mysteries are for the
   most part celebrated by night, indicating the withdrawal of the soul
   from the body, which takes place by night. "Let us not then sleep, as
   do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep, sleep in
   the night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the night. But let
   us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and
   love, and as an helmet the hope of salvation." [2889] And as to what,
   again, they say of sleep, the very same things are to be understood of
   death. For each exhibits the departure of the soul, the one more, the
   other less; as we may also get this in Heraclitus: "Man touches night
   in himself, when dead and his light quenched; and alive, when he sleeps
   he touches the dead; and awake, when he shuts his eyes, he touches the
   sleeper." [2890] "For blessed are those that have seen the Lord,"
   [2891] according to the apostle; "for it is high time to awake out of
   sleep. For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night
   is far spent, the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works
   of darkness, and put on the armour of light." [2892] By day and light
   he designates figuratively the Son, and by the armour of light
   metaphorically the promises.

   So it is said that we ought to go washed to sacrifices and prayers,
   clean and bright; and that this external adornment and purification are
   practiced for a sign. Now purity is to think holy thoughts. Further,
   there is the image of baptism, which also was handed down to the poets
   from Moses as follows:--


   "And she having drawn water, and wearing on her body clean clothes."
   [2893]

   It is Penelope that is going to prayer:--


   "And Telemachus,

   Having washed his hands in the hoary sea, prayed to Athene." [2894]

   It was a custom of the Jews to wash frequently after being in bed. It
   was then well said,--


   "Be pure, not by washing of water, but in the mind."

   For sanctity, as I conceive it, is perfect pureness of mind, and deeds,
   and thoughts, and words too, and in its last degree sinlessness in
   dreams.

   And sufficient purification to a man, I reckon, is thorough and sure
   repentance. If, condemning ourselves for our former actions, we go
   forward, after these things taking thought, [2895] and divesting our
   mind both of the things which please us through the senses, and of our
   former transgressions.

   If, then, we are to give the etymology of episteme, knowledge, its
   signification is to be derived from stasis, placing; for our soul,
   which was formerly borne, now in one way, now in another, it settles in
   objects. Similarly faith is to be explained etymologically, as the
   settling (stasis) of our soul respecting that which is.

   But we desire to learn about the man who is always and in all things
   righteous; who, neither dreading the penalty proceeding from the law,
   nor fearing to entertain hatred of evil in the case of those who live
   with him and who prosecute the injured, nor dreading danger at the
   hands of those who do wrong, remains righteous. For he who, on account
   of these considerations, abstains from anything wrong, is not
   voluntarily kind, but is good from fear. Even Epicurus says, that the
   man who in his estimation was wise, "would not do wrong to any one for
   the sake of gain; for he could not persuade himself that he would
   escape detection." So that, if he knew he would not be detected, he
   would, according to him, do evil. And such are the doctrines of
   darkness. If, too, one shall abstain from doing wrong from hope of the
   recompense given by God on account of righteous deeds, he is not on
   this supposition spontaneously good. For as fear makes that man just,
   so reward makes this one; or rather, makes him appear to be just. But
   with the hope after death--a good hope to the good, to the bad the
   reverse--not only they who follow after Barbarian wisdom, but also the
   Pythagoreans, are acquainted. For the latter also proposed hope as an
   end to those who philosophize. Whereas Socrates [2896] also, in the
   Phædo, says "that good souls depart hence with a good hope;" and again,
   denouncing the wicked, he sets against this the assertion, "For they
   live with an evil hope." With him Heraclitus manifestly agrees in his
   dissertations concerning men: "There awaits man after death what they
   neither hope nor think." Divinely, therefore, Paul writes expressly,
   "Tribulation worketh, patience, and patience experience, and experience
   hope; and hope maketh not ashamed." [2897] For the patience is on
   account of the hope in the future. Now hope is synonymous with the
   recompense and restitution of hope; which maketh not ashamed, not being
   any more vilified.

   But he who obeys the mere call, as he is called, neither for fear, nor
   for enjoyments, is on his way to knowledge (gnosis). For he does not
   consider whether any extrinsic lucrative gain or enjoyment follows to
   him; but drawn by the love of Him who is the true object of love, and
   led to what is requisite, practices piety. So that not even were we to
   suppose him to receive from God leave to do things forbidden with
   impunity; not even if he were to get the promise that he would receive
   as a reward the good things of the blessed; but besides, not even if he
   could persuade himself that God would be hoodwinked with reference to
   what he does (which is impossible), would he ever wish to do aught
   contrary to right reason, having once made choice of what is truly good
   and worthy of choice on its own account, and therefore to be loved. For
   it is not in the food of the belly, that we have heard good to be
   situated. But he has heard that "meat will not commend us," [2898] nor
   marriage, nor abstinence from marriage in ignorance; but virtuous
   gnostic conduct. For the dog, which is an irrational animal, may be
   said to be continent, dreading as it does the uplifted stick, and
   therefore keeping away from the meat. But let the predicted promise be
   taken away, and the threatened dread cancelled, and the impending
   danger removed, and the disposition of such people will be revealed.

      Chapter XXIII.--The Same Subject Continued.

   For it is not suitable to the nature of the thing itself, that they
   should apprehend in the truly gnostic manner the truth, that all things
   which were created for our use are good; as, for example, marriage and
   procreation, when used in moderation; and that it is better than good
   to become free of passion, and virtuous by assimilation to the divine.
   But in the case of external things, agreeable or disagreeable, from
   some they abstain, from others not. But in those things from which they
   abstain from disgust, they plainly find fault with the creature and the
   Creator; and though in appearance they walk faithfully, the opinion
   they maintain is impious. That command, "Thou shall not lust," needs
   neither the necessity arising from fear, which compels to keep from
   things that are pleasant; nor the reward, which by promise persuades to
   restrain the impulses of passion.

   And those who obey God through the promise, caught by the bait of
   pleasure, choose obedience not for the sake of the commandment, but for
   the sake of the promise. Nor will turning away from objects of sense,
   as a matter of necessary consequence, produce attachment to
   intellectual objects. On the contrary, the attachment to intellectual
   objects naturally becomes to the Gnostic an influence which draws away
   from the objects of sense; inasmuch as he, in virtue of the selection
   of what is good, has chosen what is good according to knowledge
   (gnostikos), admiring generation, and by sanctifying the Creator
   sanctifying assimilation to the divine. But I shall free myself from
   lust, let him say, O Lord, for the sake of alliance with Thee. For the
   economy of creation is good, and all things are well administered:
   nothing happens without a cause. I must be in what is Thine, O
   Omnipotent One. And if I am there, I am near Thee. And I would be free
   of fear that I may be able to draw near to Thee, and to be satisfied
   with little, practising Thy just choice between things good and things
   like.

   Right mystically and sacredly the apostle, teaching us the choice which
   is truly gracious, not in the way of rejection of other things as bad,
   but so as to do things better than what is good, has spoken, saying,
   "So he that giveth his virgin in marriage doeth well; and he that
   giveth her not doeth better; as far as respects seemliness and
   undistracted attendance on the Lord." [2899]

   Now we know that things which are difficult are not essential; but that
   things which are essential have been graciously made easy of attainment
   by God. Wherefore Democritus well says, that "nature and instruction"
   are like each other. And we have briefly assigned the cause. For
   instruction harmonizes man, and by harmonizing makes him natural; and
   it is no matter whether one was made such as he is by nature, or
   transformed by time and education. The Lord has furnished both; that
   which is by creation, and that which is by creating again and renewal
   through the covenant. And that is preferable which is advantageous to
   what is superior; but what is superior to everything is mind. So, then,
   what is really good is seen to be most pleasant, and of itself produces
   the fruit which is desired--tranquillity of soul. "And he who hears
   Me," it is said, "shall rest in peace, confident, and shall be calm
   without fear of any evil." [2900] "Rely with all thy heart and thy mind
   on God." [2901]

   On this wise it is possible for the Gnostic already to have become God.
   "I said, Ye are gods, and [2902] sons of the highest." And Empedocles
   says that the souls of the wise become gods, writing as follows:--


   "At last prophets, minstrels, and physicians,

   And the foremost among mortal men, approach;

   Whence spring gods supreme in honours."

   Man, then, genetically considered, is formed in accordance with the
   idea of the connate spirit. For he is not created formless and
   shapeless in the workshop of nature, where mystically the production of
   man is accomplished, both art and essence being common. But the
   individual man is stamped according to the impression produced in the
   soul by the objects of his choice. Thus we say that Adam was perfect,
   as far as respects his formation; for none of the distinctive
   characteristics of the idea and form of man were wanting to him; but in
   the act of coming into being he received perfection. And he was
   justified by obedience; this was reaching manhood, as far as depended
   on him. And the cause lay in his choosing, and especially in his
   choosing what was forbidden. God was not the cause.

   For production is twofold--of things procreated, and of things that
   grow. And manliness in man, who is subject to perturbation, as they
   say, makes him who partakes of it essentially fearless and invincible;
   and anger is the mind's satellite in patience, and endurance, and the
   like; and self-constraint and salutary sense are set over desire. But
   God is impassible, free of anger, destitute of desire. And He is not
   free of fear, in the sense of avoiding what is terrible; or temperate,
   in the sense of having command of desires. For neither can the nature
   of God fall in with anything terrible, nor does God flee fear; just as
   He will not feel desire, so as to rule over desires. Accordingly that
   Pythagorean saying was mystically uttered respecting us, "that man
   ought to become one;" for the high priest himself is one, God being one
   in the immutable state of the perpetual flow [2903] of good things. Now
   the Saviour has taken away wrath in and with lust, wrath being lust of
   vengeance. For universally liability to feeling belongs to every kind
   of desire; and man, when deified purely into a passionless state,
   becomes a unit. As, then, those, who at sea are held by an anchor, pull
   at the anchor, but do not drag it to them, but drag themselves to the
   anchor; so those who, according to the gnostic life, draw God towards
   them, imperceptibly bring themselves to God: for he who reverences God,
   reverences himself. In the contemplative life, then, one in worshipping
   God attends to himself, and through his own spotless purification
   beholds the holy God holily; for self-control, being present, surveying
   and contemplating itself uninterruptedly, is as far as possible
   assimilated to God.

      Chapter XXIV.--The Reason and End of Divine Punishments.

   Now that is in our power, of which equally with its opposite we are
   masters,--as, say to philosophize or not, to believe or disbelieve. In
   consequence, then, of our being equally masters of each of the
   opposites, what depends on us is found possible. Now the commandments
   may be done or not done by us, who, as is reasonable, are liable to
   praise and blame. And those, again, who are punished on account of sins
   committed by them, are punished for them alone; for what is done is
   past, and what is done can never be undone. The sins committed before
   faith are accordingly forgiven by the Lord, not that they may be
   undone, but as if they had not been done. "But not all," says
   Basilides, [2904] "but only sins involuntary and in ignorance, are
   forgiven;" as would be the case were it a man, and not God, that
   conferred such a boon. To such an one Scripture says, "Thou thoughtest
   that I would be like thee." [2905] But if we are punished for voluntary
   sins, we are punished not that the sins which are done may be undone,
   but because they were done. But punishment does not avail to him who
   has sinned, to undo his sin, but that he may sin no more, and that no
   one else fall into the like. Therefore the good God corrects for these
   three causes: First, that he who is corrected may become better than
   his former self; then that those who are capable of being saved by
   examples may be driven back, being admonished; and thirdly, that he who
   is injured may not be readily despised, and be apt to receive injury.
   And there are two methods of correction--the instructive and the
   punitive, which we have called the disciplinary. It ought to be known,
   then, that those who fall into sin after baptism [2906] are those who
   are subjected to discipline; for the deeds done before are remitted,
   and those done after are purged. It is in reference to the unbelieving
   that it is said, "that they are reckoned as the chaff which the wind
   drives from the face of the earth, and the drop which falls from a
   vessel." [2907]

      Chapter XXV.--True Perfection Consists in the Knowledge and Love of God.

   "Happy he who possesses the culture of knowledge, and is not moved to
   the injury of the citizens or to wrong actions, but contemplates the
   undecaying order of immortal nature, how and in what way and manner it
   subsists. To such the practice of base deeds attaches not," Rightly,
   then, Plato says, "that the man who devotes himself to the
   contemplation of ideas will live as a god among men; now the mind is
   the place of ideas, and God is mind." He says that he who contemplates
   the unseen God lives as a god among men. And in the Sophist, Socrates
   calls the stranger of Elea, who was a dialectician, "god:" "Such are
   the gods who, like stranger guests, frequent cities. For when the soul,
   rising above the sphere of generation, is by itself apart, and dwells
   amidst ideas," like the Coryphæus in Theætetus, now become as an angel,
   it will be with Christ, being rapt in contemplation, ever keeping in
   view the will of God; in reality


   "Alone wise, while these flit like shadows." [2908]

   "For the dead bury their dead." Whence Jeremiah says: "I will fill it
   with the earth-born dead whom mine anger has smitten." [2909]

   God, then, being not a subject for demonstration, cannot be the object
   of science. But the Son is wisdom, and knowledge, and truth, and all
   else that has affinity thereto. He is also susceptible of demonstration
   and of description. And all the powers of the Spirit, becoming
   collectively one thing, terminate in the same point--that is, in the
   Son. But He is incapable of being declared, in respect of the idea of
   each one of His powers. And the Son is neither simply one thing as one
   thing, nor many things as parts, but one thing as all things; whence
   also He is all things. For He is the circle of all powers rolled and
   united into one unity. Wherefore the Word is called the Alpha and the
   Omega, of whom alone the end becomes beginning, and ends again at the
   original beginning without any break. Wherefore also to believe in Him,
   and by Him, is to become a unit, being indissolubly united in Him; and
   to disbelieve is to be separated, disjoined, divided.

   "Wherefore thus saith the Lord, Every alien son is uncircumcised in
   heart, and uncircumcised in flesh" (that is, unclean in body and soul):
   "there shall not enter one of the strangers into the midst of the house
   of Israel, but the Levites." [2910] He calls those that would not
   believe, but would disbelieve, strangers. Only those who live purely
   being true priests of God. Wherefore, of all the circumcised tribes,
   those anointed to be high priests, and kings, and prophets, were
   reckoned more holy. Whence He commands them not to touch dead bodies,
   or approach the dead; not that the body was polluted, but that sin and
   disobedience were incarnate, and embodied, and dead, and therefore
   abominable. It was only, then, when a father and mother, a son and
   daughter died, that the priest was allowed to enter, because these were
   related only by flesh and seed, to whom the priest was indebted for the
   immediate cause of his entrance into life. And they purify themselves
   seven days, the period in which Creation was consummated. For on the
   seventh day the rest is celebrated; and on the eighth he brings a
   propitiation, as is written in Ezekiel, according to which propitiation
   the promise is to be received. [2911] And the perfect propitiation, I
   take it, is that propitious faith in the Gospel which is by the law and
   the prophets, and the purity which shows itself in universal obedience,
   with the abandonment of the things of the world; in order to that
   grateful surrender of the tabernacle, which results from the enjoyment
   of the soul. Whether, then, the time be that which through the seven
   periods enumerated returns to the chiefest rest, [2912] or the seven
   heavens, which some reckon one above the other; or whether also the
   fixed sphere which borders on the intellectual world be called the
   eighth, the expression denotes that the Gnostic ought to rise out of
   the sphere of creation and of sin. After these seven days, sacrifices
   are offered for sins. For there is still fear of change, and it touches
   the seventh circle. The righteous Job says: "Naked came I out of my
   mother's womb, and naked shall I return there;" [2913] not naked of
   possessions, for that were a trivial and common thing; but, as a just
   man, he departs naked of evil and sin, and of the unsightly shape which
   follows those who have led bad lives. For this was what was said,
   "Unless ye be converted, and become as children," [2914] pure in flesh,
   holy in soul by abstinence from evil deeds; showing that He would have
   us to be such as also He generated us from our mother--the water.
   [2915] For the intent of one generation succeeding another is to
   immortalize by progress. "But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out."
   [2916] That purity in body and soul which the Gnostic partakes of, the
   all-wise Moses indicated, by employing repetition in describing the
   incorruptibility of body and of soul in the person of Rebecca, thus:
   "Now the virgin was fair, and man had not known her." [2917] And
   Rebecca, interpreted, means "glory of God;" and the glory of God is
   immortality. [2918] This is in reality righteousness, not to desire
   other things, but to be entirely the consecrated temple of the Lord.
   Righteousness is peace of life and a well-conditioned state, to which
   the Lord dismissed her when He said, "Depart into peace." [2919] For
   Salem is, by interpretation, peace; of which our Saviour is enrolled
   King, as Moses says, Melchizedek king of Salem, priest of the most high
   God, who gave bread and wine, furnishing consecrated food for a type of
   the Eucharist. And Melchizedek is interpreted "righteous king;" and the
   name is a synonym for righteousness and peace. Basilides, however,
   supposes that Righteousness and her daughter Peace dwell stationed in
   the eighth sphere.

   But we must pass from physics to ethics, which are clearer; for the
   discourse concerning these will follow after the treatise in hand. The
   Saviour Himself, then, plainly initiates us into the mysteries,
   according to the words of the tragedy: [2920] --


   "Seeing those who see, he also gives the orgies."

   And if you ask,


   "These orgies, what is their nature?"

   You will hear again:--


   "It is forbidden to mortals uninitiated in the Bacchic rites to know."

   And if any one will inquire curiously what they are, let him hear:--


   "It is not lawful for thee to hear, but they are worth knowing;

   The rites of the God detest him who practices impiety."

   Now God, who is without beginning, is the perfect beginning of the
   universe, and the producer of the beginning. As, then, He is being, He
   is the first principle of the department of action, as He is good, of
   morals; as He is mind, on the other hand, He is the first principle of
   reasoning and of judgment. Whence also He alone is Teacher, who is the
   only Son of the Most High Father, the Instructor of men.

      Chapter XXVI.--How the Perfect Man Treats the Body and the Things of the
      World.

   Those, then, who run down created existence and vilify the body are
   wrong; not considering that the frame of man was formed erect for the
   contemplation of heaven, and that the organization of the senses tends
   to knowledge; and that the members and parts are arranged for good, not
   for pleasure. Whence this abode becomes receptive of the soul which is
   most precious to God; and is dignified with the Holy Spirit through the
   sanctification of soul and body, perfected with the perfection of the
   Saviour. And the succession of the three virtues is found in the
   Gnostic, who morally, physically, and logically occupies himself with
   God. For wisdom is the knowledge of things divine and human; and
   righteousness is the concord of the parts of the soul; and holiness is
   the service of God. But if one were to say that he disparaged the
   flesh, and generation on account of it, by quoting Isaiah, who says,
   "All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass:
   the grass is withered, and the flower has fallen; but the word of the
   Lord endureth for ever;" [2921] let him hear the Spirit interpreting
   the matter in question by Jeremiah, "And I scattered them like dry
   sticks, that are made to fly by the wind into the desert. This is the
   lot and portion of your disobedience, saith the Lord. As thou hast
   forgotten Me, and hast trusted in lies, so will I discover thy hinder
   parts to thy face; and thy disgrace shall be seen, thy adultery, and
   thy neighing," and so on. [2922] For "the flower of grass," and
   "walking after the flesh," and "being carnal," according to the
   apostle, are those who are in their sins. The soul of man is
   confessedly the better part of man, and the body the inferior. But
   neither is the soul good by nature, nor, on the other hand, is the body
   bad by nature. Nor is that which is not good straightway bad. For there
   are things which occupy a middle place, and among them are things to be
   preferred, and things to be rejected. The constitution of man, then,
   which has its place among things of sense, was necessarily composed of
   things diverse, but not opposite--body and soul.

   Always therefore the good actions, as better, attach to the better and
   ruling spirit; and voluptuous and sinful actions are attributed to the
   worse, the sinful one.

   Now the soul of the wise man and Gnostic, as sojourning in the body,
   conducts itself towards it gravely and respectfully, not with
   inordinate affections, as about to leave the tabernacle if the time of
   departure summon. "I am a stranger in the earth, and a sojourner with
   you," it is said. [2923] And hence Basilides says, that he apprehends
   that the election are strangers to the world, being supramundane by
   nature. But this is not the case. For all things are of one God. And no
   one is a stranger to the world by nature, their essence being one, and
   God one. But the elect man dwells as a sojourner, knowing all things to
   be possessed and disposed of; and he makes use of the things which the
   Pythagoreans make out to be the threefold good things. The body, too,
   as one sent on a distant pilgrimage, uses inns and dwellings by the
   way, having care of the things of the world, of the places where he
   halts; but leaving his dwelling-place and property without excessive
   emotion; readily following him that leads him away from life; by no
   means and on no occasion turning back; giving thanks for his sojourn,
   and blessing [God] for his departure, embracing the mansion that is in
   heaven. "For we know, that, if the earthly house of our tabernacle be
   dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands,
   eternal in the heavens. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan,
   desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: if so
   be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. For we walk by
   faith, not by sight," [2924] as the apostle says; "and we are willing
   rather to be absent from the body, and present with God." The rather is
   in comparison. And comparison obtains in the case of things that fall
   under resemblance; as the more valiant man is more valiant among the
   valiant, and most valiant among cowards. Whence he adds, "Wherefore we
   strive, whether present or absent, to be accepted with Him," [2925]
   that is, God, whose work and creation are all things, both the world
   and things supramundane. I admire Epicharmus, who clearly says:--


   "Endowed with pious mind, you will not, in dying,

   Suffer aught evil. The spirit will dwell in heaven above;"

   and the minstrel [2926] who sings:--


   "The souls of the wicked flit about below the skies on earth,

   In murderous pains beneath inevitable yokes of evils;

   But those of the pious dwell in the heavens,

   Hymning in songs the Great, the Blessed One."

   The soul is not then sent down from heaven to what is worse. For God
   works all things up to what is better. But the soul which has chosen
   the best life--the life that is from God and righteousness--exchanges
   earth for heaven. With reason therefore, Job, who had attained to
   knowledge, said, "Now I know that thou canst do all things; and nothing
   is impossible to Thee. For who tells me of what I know not, great and
   wonderful things with which I was unacquainted? And I felt myself vile,
   considering myself to be earth and ashes." [2927] For he who, being in
   a state of ignorance, is sinful, "is earth and ashes;" while he who is
   in a state of knowledge, being assimilated as far as possible to God,
   is already spiritual, and so elect. And that Scripture calls the
   senseless and disobedient "earth," will be made clear by Jeremiah the
   prophet, saying, in reference to Joachim and his brethren "Earth,
   earth, hear the word of the Lord; Write this man, as man
   excommunicated." [2928] And another prophet says again, "Hear, O
   heaven; and give ear, O earth," [2929] calling understanding "ear," and
   the soul of the Gnostic, that of the man who has applied himself to the
   contemplation of heaven and divine things, and in this way has become
   an Israelite, "heaven." For again he calls him who has made ignorance
   and hardness of heart his choice, "earth." And the expression "give
   ear" he derives from the "organs of hearing," "the ears," attributing
   carnal things to those who cleave to the things of sense. Such are they
   of whom Micah the prophet says, "Hear the word of the Lord, ye peoples
   who dwell with pangs." [2930] And Abraham said, "By no means. The Lord
   is He who judgeth the earth;" [2931] "since he that believeth not, is,"
   according to the utterance of the Saviour, "condemned already." [2932]
   And there is written in the Kings [2933] the judgment and sentence of
   the Lord, which stands thus: "The Lord hears the righteous, but the
   wicked He saveth not, because they do not desire to know God." For the
   Almighty will not accomplish what is absurd. What do the heresies say
   to this utterance, seeing Scripture proclaims the Almighty God to be
   good, and not the author of evil and wrong, if indeed ignorance arises
   from one not knowing? But God does nothing absurd. "For this God," it
   is said, "is our God, and there is none to save besides Him." [2934]
   "For there is no unrighteousness with God," [2935] according to the
   apostle. And clearly yet the prophet teaches the will of God, and the
   gnostic proficiency, in these words: "And now, Israel, what doth the
   Lord God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and walk in all
   His ways, and love Him, and serve Him alone?" [2936] He asks of thee,
   who hast the power of choosing salvation. What is it, then, that the
   Pythagoreans mean when they bid us "pray with the voice"? As seems to
   me, not that they thought the Divinity could not hear those who speak
   silently, but because they wished prayers to be right, which no one
   would be ashamed to make in the knowledge of many. We shall, however,
   treat of prayer in due course by and by. But we ought to have works
   that cry aloud, as becoming "those who walk in the day." [2937] "Let
   thy works shine," [2938] and behold a man and his works before his
   face. "For behold God and His works." [2939] For the gnostic must, as
   far as is possible, imitate God. And the poets call the elect in their
   pages godlike and gods, and equal to the gods, and equal in sagacity to
   Zeus, and having counsels like the gods, and resembling the
   gods,--nibbling, as seems to me, at the expression, "in the image and
   likeness." [2940]

   Euripides accordingly says, "Golden wings are round my back, and I am
   shod with the winged sandals of the Sirens; and I shall go aloft into
   the wide ether, to hold convene with Zeus."

   But I shall pray the Spirit of Christ to wing me to my Jerusalem. For
   the Stoics say that heaven is properly a city, but places here on earth
   are not cities; for they are called so, but are not. For a city is an
   important thing, and the people a decorous body, and a multitude of men
   regulated by law as the church by the word--a city on earth
   impregnable--free from tyranny; a product of the divine will on earth
   as in heaven. Images of this city the poets create with their pen. For
   the Hyperboreans, and the Arimaspian cities, and the Elysian plains,
   are commonwealths of just men. And we know Plato's city placed as a
   pattern in heaven. [2941]

  Elucidations.

      I.

   (The Lord's Discipline, book iv. [80]cap. vi. p. 413.)

   he kuriake askesis. Casaubon explains this as Dominica exercitatio (the
   religion which the Lord taught), and quotes the apostolic canons (li.
   and lii.), which, using this word (askesis), ordain certain fasts on
   account of pious exercise. Baronius, more suo, grasps at this word
   askesis, as a peg to hang the system of monkery upon. Casaubon answers:
   "If so, then all the early Christians were monks and nuns; as this word
   is always used by the Fathers for the Christian discipline, or
   Christianity itself." Such are the original ascetics, nothing more. The
   Christian Fathers transferred the word from heathen use to that of the
   Church, to signify the training to which all the faithful should
   subject themselves, in obedience to St. Paul (1 Cor. ix. 24-27). See
   Isaaci Casauboni, De Annalibus Baronianis Exercitationes, p. 171.

      II.

   (Theano, [81]cap. xix. p. 431.)

   The translator has not been happy in this rendering, but I retain it as
   in the Edinburgh Edition, which leaves one in doubt whether this second
   saying was Theano's; for, possibly, the translator meant to leave it
   so. But the Migne note is very good: "Jamblichus mentions two Theanos,
   one the wife of Brontinus, or Brotinus, and the other of Pythagoras.
   Both alike were devoted to the Pythagorean philosophy; and it is not
   certain, therefore, to which of them these dicta belong." Theodoret
   quotes both, but decides not this doubt. Hoffman says, "There were many
   of the name;" and he mentions five different ones. Suidas makes mention
   of Theano of Crotona as the wife of Pythagoras, "the first woman who
   philosophized and wrote poetry;" and Hoffman doubts not this lady is
   the one quoted by Clement. She seems to have presided over the school
   of her husband after his death. Of the beauty and morality of the
   second dictum, I have spoken already (p. 348, Elucidation XI.); and I
   think it worth whole volumes of casuistry on a subject which (naturâ
   duce, sub lege Logi) the Gospel modestly leaves to natural decency and
   enlightened conscience. (See Clement's fine remarks, on p. 435.

      III.

   (St. Paul, [82]note 4, p. 434.)

   Better rendered, "Paul is more recent (or later) in respect of time."
   This seems a strangely apologetic way to speak of this glorious
   apostle; though the reference may be to his own words (1 Cor. xv. 8),
   "as of one born out of due time." And it suggests to me, that, among
   the Alexandrian Christians, there were many Jewish converts who said,
   "I am of Apollos," and with whom the name of the great apostle of the
   Gentiles was still unsavoury. This goes to confirm the Pauline origin
   of the Epistle to the Hebrews, so far as it accounts for (what is
   testified by Eusebius, vi. 14) his omission of his own name from his
   treatise, lest it should prejudice his argument with his Hebrew
   kinsmen. Apollos may have sent it to Alexandria.

      IV.

   (Socrates, [83]cap. xxii. p. 436.)

   Who can read the Phædo, and think of Plato and Socrates, without hope
   that the mystery of redemption applies to them in some effectual way,
   under St. Paul's maxims (Rom. ii. 26)? It would torture me in reading
   such sayings as are quoted here, were I not able reverently to indulge
   such hope, and then to desist from speculation. Cannot we be silent
   where Scripture is silent, and leave all to Him who loved the Gentiles,
   and died for them on the cross? I suspect the itch of our times, on
   this and like subjects, to be presumption (2 Cor. x. 5) "against the
   obedience of Christ." As if our own concern for the heathen were
   greater than His who died for the unjust, praying for His murderers!
   Why not leave the ransomed world to the world's Redeemer? The cross
   bore the inscription in Greek, and Latin also; for the Jews scorned it
   in Hebrew: and who can doubt that those outstretched arms embraced all
   mankind?

      V.

   (Basilides answered, [84]cap. xxiv. p. 437.)

   Note the pith and point of this chapter, and the beauty of Clement's
   dictum, "So it would be, were it a man and not God that justifies! As
   it is written, Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as
   thyself." (Compare Matt. xx. 14.) But let us not overlook his
   exposition of the ends and purposes of chastisement. The great
   principle which he lays down destroys the whole Trent theology about
   penance, and annihilates the logical base of its figment about
   "Purgatory." "Punishment does not avail to him who has sinned, to undo
   his sin." The precious blood of Christ "speaketh better things."

      VI.

   (Sin after Baptism, [85]cap. xxiv. p. 438.)

   Not to broach any opinion of my own, it is enough to remark, that this
   reference to primitive discipline shows that a defined penitential
   system in the early Church was aimed at by the Montanists, and inspired
   their deadly animosity, not merely as a theory, but as a system.
   Although differing on many points with Dr. Bunsen (he is both Baron and
   Doctor, and I give him the more honourable title of the two), I feel it
   due to my contract with the reader of this series to refer him to what
   he says of the baptismal vow, etc. (Hippol., iii. p. 187), as
   furnishing a valuable commentary on the text, and on the whole plan of
   Alexandrian teaching and discipline.

      VII.

   (Jubilee, [86]cap. xxv. p. 438.)

   Here the reader may feel that an Elucidation is requisite to any
   intelligent idea of what Clement means to say. "We wish he would
   explain his explanation" of Ezekiel. Let me give a brief rendering of
   the annotations in Migne, as all that can here be furnished. (1) The
   tabernacle is the body, as St. Paul uses the word (2 Cor. v. 1-4), and
   St. Peter (2 Ep. i. 13, 14). (2) The seven periods are the Sabbatical
   weeks of years leading up to the year of Jubilee. (3) The aplanes chora
   refers to the old system of astronomy, and its division of the heavens
   into an octave of spheres, of which the seven inner spheres are those
   of the seven planets; the fixt stars being in the eighth, which
   "borders on the intellectual world,"--the abode of spirits, according
   to Clement.

   The Miltonic student will recall the perplexity with which, perhaps, in
   early years, he first read:--


   "They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixt,

   And that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs

   The trepidation talked, and that first moved.

   Paradise Lost, book iii. 481.

   The Copernican system was, even in Milton's time, not generally
   accepted; but, for one who had personally conversed with Galileo, this
   seems incorrigibly bad. The true system would have given greater
   dignity, and in fact a better topography, to his great poem.

      VIII.

   (Rebecca, [87]p. 439.)

   Le Nourry, as well as Barbeyrac (see Kaye, pp. 109 and 473), regards
   Clement as ignorant of the Hebrew language. Kaye, though he shows that
   some of the attempts to demonstrate this are fanciful, inclines to the
   same opinion; remarking that he borrows his interpretations from Philo.
   On the passage here under consideration, he observes, that, "having
   said repeatedly [2942] that Rebekah in Hebrew is equivalent to hupomone
   in Greek, he now makes it equivalent to Theou doxa. He elsewhere refers
   our Saviour's exclamation, Eli, Eli, etc., to the Greek word helios,
   and the name Jesus to iasthai."

      IX.

   (Plato's City, [88]cap. xxvi. p. 441.)

   This is worth quoting from the Republic (book ix. p. 423, Jowett): "In
   heaven there is laid up a pattern of such a city; and he who desires
   may behold this, and, beholding, govern himself accordingly; He will
   act according to the laws of that city, and of no other." Sublime old
   Gentile! Did not the apostle of the Gentiles think of Socrates, when he
   wrote Heb. xii. 28, and xiii. 14? On this noble passage, of which
   Clement has evidently thought very seriously, Schleiermacher's remarks
   seem to me cold and unsatisfactory. (See his Introductions, translated
   by Dobson; ed. Cambridge, 1836.)

      Chap. I.--On Faith.

   Of the Gnostic so much has been cursorily, as it were, written. We
   proceed now to the sequel, and must again contemplate faith; for there
   are some that draw the distinction, that faith has reference to the
   Son, and knowledge to the Spirit. But it has escaped their notice that,
   in order to believe truly in the Son, we must believe that He is the
   Son, and that He came, and how, and for what, and respecting His
   passion; and we must know who is the Son of God. Now neither is
   knowledge without faith, nor faith without knowledge. Nor is the Father
   without the Son; for the Son is with the Father. And the Son is the
   true teacher respecting the Father; and that we may believe in the Son,
   we must know the Father, with whom also is the Son. Again, in order
   that we may know the Father, we must believe in the Son, that it is the
   Son of God who teaches; for from faith to knowledge by the Son is the
   Father. And the knowledge of the Son and Father, which is according to
   the gnostic rule--that which in reality is gnostic--is the attainment
   and comprehension of the truth by the truth.

   We, then, are those who are believers in what is not believed, and who
   are Gnostics as to what is unknown; that is, Gnostics as to what is
   unknown and disbelieved by all, but believed and known by a few; and
   Gnostics, not describing actions by speech, but Gnostics in the
   exercise of contemplation. Happy is he who speaks in the ears of the
   hearing. Now faith is the ear of the soul. And such the Lord intimates
   faith to be, when He says, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear;"
   [2943] so that by believing he may comprehend what He says, as He says
   it. Homer, too, the oldest of the poets, using the word "hear" instead
   of "perceive"--the specific for the generic term--writes:--


   "Him most they heard." [2944]

   For, in fine, the agreement and harmony of the faith of both [2945]
   contribute to one end--salvation. We have in the apostle an unerring
   witness: "For I desire to see you, that I may impart unto you some
   spiritual gift, in order that ye may be strengthened; that is, that I
   may be comforted in you, by the mutual faith of you and me." [2946] And
   further on again he adds, "The righteousness of God is revealed from
   faith to faith." [2947] The apostle, then, manifestly announces a
   twofold faith, or rather one which admits of growth and perfection; for
   the common faith lies beneath as a foundation. [2948] To those,
   therefore, who desire to be healed, and are moved by faith, He added,
   "Thy faith hath saved thee." [2949] But that which is excellently built
   upon is consummated in the believer, and is again perfected by the
   faith which results from instruction and the word, in order to the
   performance of the commandments. Such were the apostles, in whose case
   it is said that "faith removed mountains and transplanted trees."
   [2950] Whence, perceiving the greatness of its power, they asked "that
   faith might be added to them;" [2951] a faith which salutarily bites
   the soil "like a grain of mustard," and grows magnificently in it, to
   such a degree that the reasons of things sublime rest on it. For if one
   by nature knows God, as Basilides thinks, who calls intelligence of a
   superior order at once faith and kingship, and a creation worthy of the
   essence of the Creator; and explains that near Him exists not power,
   but essence and nature and substance; and says that faith is not the
   rational assent of the soul exercising free-will, but an undefined
   beauty, belonging immediately to the creature;--the precepts both of
   the Old and of the New Testament are, then, superfluous, if one is
   saved by nature, as Valentinus would have it, and is a believer and an
   elect man by nature, as Basilides thinks; and nature would have been
   able, one time or other, to have shone forth, apart from the Saviour's
   appearance. But were they to say that the visit of the Saviour was
   necessary, then the properties of nature are gone from them, the elect
   being saved by instruction, and purification, and the doing of good
   works. Abraham, accordingly, who through hearing believed the voice,
   which promised under the oak in Mamre, "I will give this land to thee,
   and to thy seed," was either elect or not. But if he was not, how did
   he straightway believe, as it were naturally? And if he was elect,
   their hypothesis is done away with, inasmuch as even previous to the
   coming of the Lord an election was found, and that saved: "For it was
   reckoned to him for righteousness." [2952] For if any one, following
   Marcion, should dare to say that the Creator (Demiourgon) saved the man
   that believed on him, even before the advent of the Lord, (the election
   being saved with their own proper salvation); the power of the good
   Being will be eclipsed; inasmuch as late only, and subsequent to the
   Creator spoken of by them in words of good omen, it made the attempt to
   save, and by instruction, and in imitation of him. But if, being such,
   the good Being save, according to them; neither is it his own that he
   saves, nor is it with the consent of him who formed the creation that
   he essays salvation, but by force or fraud. And how can he any more be
   good, acting thus, and being posterior? But if the locality is
   different, and the dwelling-place of the Omnipotent is remote from the
   dwelling-place of the good God; yet the will of him who saves, having
   been the first to begin, is not inferior to that of the good God. From
   what has been previously proved, those who believe not are proved
   senseless: "For their paths are perverted, and they know not peace,"
   saith the prophet. [2953] "But foolish and unlearned questions" the
   divine Paul exhorted to "avoid, because they gender strifes." [2954]
   And Æschylus exclaims:--


   "In what profits not, labour not in vain."

   For that investigation, which accords with faith, which builds, on the
   foundation of faith, [2955] the august knowledge of the truth, we know
   to be the best. Now we know that neither things which are clear are
   made subjects of investigation, such as if it is day, while it is day;
   nor things unknown, and never destined to become clear, as whether the
   stars are even or odd in number; nor things convertible; and those are
   so which can be said equally by those who take the opposite side, as if
   what is in the womb is a living creature or not. A fourth mode is,
   when, from either side of those, there is advanced an unanswerable and
   irrefragable argument. If, then, the ground of inquiry, according to
   all of these modes, is removed, faith is established. For we advance to
   them the unanswerable consideration, that it is God who speaks and
   comes to our help in writing, respecting each one of the points
   regarding which I investigate. Who, then, is so impious as to
   disbelieve God, and to demand proofs from God as from men? Again, some
   questions demand the evidence of the senses, [2956] as if one were to
   ask whether the fire be warm, or the snow white; and some admonition
   and rebuke, as the question if you ought to honour your parents. And
   there are those that deserve punishment, as to ask proofs of the
   existence of Providence. There being then a Providence, it were impious
   to think that the whole of prophecy and the economy in reference to a
   Saviour did not take place in accordance with Providence. And perchance
   one should not even attempt to demonstrate such points, the divine
   Providence being evident from the sight of all its skilful and wise
   works which are seen, some of which take place in order, and some
   appear in order. And He who communicated to us being and life, has
   communicated to us also reason, wishing us to live rationally and
   rightly. For the Word of the Father of the universe is not the uttered
   word (logos prophorikos), but the wisdom and most manifest kindness of
   God, and His power too, which is almighty and truly divine, and not
   incapable of being conceived by those who do not confess--the
   all-potent will. But since some are unbelieving, and some are
   disputatious, all do not attain to the perfection of the good. For
   neither is it possible to attain it without the exercise of free
   choice; nor does the whole depend on our own purpose; as, for example,
   what is defined to happen. "For by grace we are saved:" not, indeed,
   without good works; but we must, by being formed for what is good,
   acquire an inclination for it. And we must possess the healthy mind
   which is fixed on the pursuit of the good; in order to which we have
   the greatest need of divine grace, and of right teaching, and of holy
   susceptibility, and of the drawing of the Father to Him. For, bound in
   this earthly body, we apprehend the objects of sense by means of the
   body; but we grasp intellectual objects by means of the logical faculty
   itself. But if one expect to apprehend all things by the senses, he has
   fallen far from the truth. Spiritually, therefore, the apostle writes
   respecting the knowledge of God, "For now we see as through a glass,
   but then face to face." [2957] For the vision of the truth is given but
   to few. Accordingly, Plato says in the Epinomis, "I do not say that it
   is possible for all to be blessed and happy; only a few. Whilst we
   live, I pronounce this to be the case. But there is a good hope that
   after death I shall attain all." To the same effect is what we find in
   Moses: "No man shall see My face, and live." [2958] For it is evident
   that no one during the period of life has been able to apprehend God
   clearly. But "the pure in heart shall see God," [2959] when they arrive
   at the final perfection. For since the soul became too enfeebled for
   the apprehension of realities, we needed a divine teacher. The Saviour
   is sent down--a teacher and leader in the acquisition of the good--the
   secret and sacred token of the great Providence. "Where, then, is the
   scribe? where is the searcher of this world? Hath not God made foolish
   the wisdom of this world?" [2960] it is said. And again, "I will
   destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the understanding
   of the prudent," [2961] plainly of those wise in their own eyes, and
   disputatious. Excellently therefore Jeremiah says, "Thus saith the
   Lord, Stand in the ways, and ask for the eternal paths, what is the
   good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find expiation for your souls."
   [2962] Ask, he says, and inquire of those who know, without contention
   and dispute. And on learning the way of truth, let us walk on the right
   way, without turning till we attain to what we desire. It was therefore
   with reason that the king of the Romans (his name was Numa), being a
   Pythagorean, first of all men, erected a temple to Faith and Peace.
   "And to Abraham, on believing, righteousness was reckoned." [2963] He,
   prosecuting the lofty philosophy of aerial phenomena, and the sublime
   philosophy of the movements in the heavens, was called Abram, which is
   interpreted "sublime father." [2964] But afterwards, on looking up to
   heaven, whether it was that he saw the Son in the spirit, as some
   explain, or a glorious angel, or in any other way recognised God to be
   superior to the creation, and all the order in it, he receives in
   addition the Alpha, the knowledge of the one and only God, and is
   called Abraam, having, instead of a natural philosopher, become wise,
   and a lover of God. For it is interpreted, "elect father of sound." For
   by sound is the uttered word: the mind is its father; and the mind of
   the good man is elect. I cannot forbear praising exceedingly the poet
   of Agrigentum, who celebrates faith as follows:--


   "Friends, I know, then, that there is truth in the myths

   Which I will relate. But very difficult to men,

   And irksome to the mind, is the attempt of faith." [2965]

   Wherefore also the apostle exhorts, "that your faith should not be in
   the wisdom of men," who profess to persuade, "but in the power of God,"
   [2966] which alone without proofs, by mere faith, is able to save. "For
   the most approved of those that are reputable knows how to keep watch.
   And justice will apprehend the forgers and witnesses of lies," says the
   Ephesian. [2967] For he, having derived his knowledge from the
   barbarian philosophy, is acquainted with the purification by fire of
   those who have led bad lives, which the Stoics afterwards called the
   Conflagration (ekpurosis), in which also they teach that each will
   arise exactly as he was, so treating of the resurrection; while Plato
   says as follows, that the earth at certain periods is purified by fire
   and water: "There have been many destructions of men in many ways; and
   there shall be very great ones by fire and water; and others briefer by
   innumerable causes." And after a little he adds: "And, in truth, there
   is a change of the objects which revolve about earth and heaven; and in
   the course of long periods there is the destruction of the objects on
   earth by a great conflagration." Then he subjoins respecting the
   deluge: "But when, again, the gods deluge the earth to purify it with
   water, those on the mountains, herdsmen and shepherds, are saved; those
   in your cities are carried down by the rivers into the sea." And we
   showed in the first Miscellany [2968] that the philosophers of the
   Greeks are called thieves, inasmuch as they have taken without
   acknowledgment their principal dogmas from Moses and the prophets. To
   which also we shall add, that the angels who had obtained the superior
   rank, having sunk into pleasures, told to the women [2969] the secrets
   which had come to their knowledge; while the rest of the angels
   concealed them, or rather, kept them against the coming of the Lord.
   Thence emanated the doctrine of providence, and the revelation of high
   things; and prophecy having already been imparted to the philosophers
   of the Greeks, the treatment of dogma arose among the philosophers,
   sometimes true when they hit the mark, and sometimes erroneous, when
   they comprehended not the secret of the prophetic allegory. And this it
   is proposed briefly to indicate in running over the points requiring
   mention. Faith, then, we say, we are to show must not be inert and
   alone, but accompanied with investigation. For I do not say that we are
   not to inquire at all. For "Search, and thou shalt find," [2970] it is
   said.


   "What is sought may be captured,

   But what is neglected escapes,"

   according to Sophocles.

   The like also says Menander the comic poet:--


   "All things sought,

   The wisest say, need anxious thought.

   But we ought to direct the visual faculty of the soul aright to
   discovery, and to clear away obstacles; and to cast clean away
   contention, and envy, and strife, destined to perish miserably from
   among men.

   For very beautifully does Timon of Phlius write:--


   "And Strife, the Plague of Mortals, stalks vainly shrieking,

   The sister of Murderous Quarrel and Discord,

   Which rolls blindly over all things. But then

   It sets its head towards men, and casts them on hope."

   Then a little below he adds:--


   "For who hath set these to fight in deadly strife?

   A rabble keeping pace with Echo; for, enraged at those silent,

   It raised an evil disease against men, and many perished;"

   of the speech which denies what is false, and of the dilemma, of that
   which is concealed, of the Sorites, and of the Crocodilean, of that
   which is open, and of ambiguities and sophisms. To inquire, then,
   respecting God, if it tend not to strife, but to discovery, is
   salutary. For it is written in David, "The poor eat, and shall be
   filled; and they shall praise the Lord that seek Him. Your heart shall
   live for ever." [2971] For they who seek Him after the true search,
   praising the Lord, shall be filled with the gift that comes from God,
   that is, knowledge. And their soul shall live; for the soul is
   figuratively termed the heart, which ministers life: for by the Son is
   the Father known.

   We ought not to surrender our ears to all who speak and write rashly.
   For cups also, which are taken hold of by many by the ears, are
   dirtied, and lose the ears; and besides, when they fall they are
   broken. In the same way also, those, who have polluted the pure hearing
   of faith by many trifles, at last becoming deaf to the truth, become
   useless and fall to the earth. It is not, then, without reason that we
   commanded boys to kiss their relations, holding them by the ears;
   indicating this, that the feeling of love is engendered by hearing. And
   "God," who is known to those who love, "is love," [2972] as "God," who
   by instruction is communicated to the faithful, "is faithful;" [2973]
   and we must be allied to Him by divine love: so that by like we may see
   like, hearing the word of truth guilelessly and purely, as children who
   obey us. And this was what he, whoever he was, indicated who wrote on
   the entrance to the temple at Epidaurus the inscription:--


   "Pure he must be who goes within

   The incense-perfumed fane."

   And purity is "to think holy thoughts." "Except ye become as these
   little children, ye shall not enter," it is said, "into the kingdom of
   heaven." [2974] For there the temple of God is seen established on
   three foundations--faith, hope, and love.

      Chap. II.--On Hope.

   Respecting faith we have adduced sufficient testimonies of writings
   among the Greeks. But in order not to exceed bounds, through eagerness
   to collect a very great many also respecting hope and love, suffice it
   merely to say that in the Crito Socrates, who prefers a good life and
   death to life itself, thinks that we have hope of another life after
   death.

   Also in the Phoedrus he says, "That only when in a separate state can
   the soul become partaker of the wisdom which is true, and surpasses
   human power; and when, having reached the end of hope by philosophic
   love, desire shall waft it to heaven, then," says he, "does it receive
   the commencement of another, an immortal life." And in the Symposium he
   says, "That there is instilled into all the natural love of generating
   what is like, and in men of generating men alone, and in the good man
   of the generation of the counterpart of himself. But it is impossible
   for the good man to do this without possessing the perfect virtues, in
   which he will train the youth who have recourse to him." And as he says
   in the Theoetetus,"He will beget and finish men. For some procreate by
   the body, others by the soul;" since also with the barbarian
   philosophers to teach and enlighten is called to regenerate; and "I
   have begotten you in Jesus Christ," [2975] says the good apostle
   somewhere.

   Empedocles, too, enumerates friendship among the elements, conceiving
   it as a combining love:--


   "Which do you look at with your mind; and don't sit gaping with your
   eyes."

   Parmenides, too, in his poem, alluding to hope, speaks thus:--


   "Yet look with the mind certainly on what is absent as present,

   For it will not sever that which is from the grasp it has of that which
   is

   Not, even if scattered in every direction over the world or combined."

      Chapter III.--The Objects of Faith and Hope Perceived by the Mind Alone.

   For he who hopes, as he who believes, sees intellectual objects and
   future things with the mind. If, then, we affirm that aught is just,
   and affirm it to be good, and we also say that truth is something, yet
   we have never seen any of such objects with our eyes, but with our mind
   alone. Now the Word of God says, "I am the truth." [2976] The Word is
   then to be contemplated by the mind. "Do you aver," it was said, [2977]
   "that there are any true philosophers?" "Yes," said I, "those who love
   to contemplate the truth." In the Phoedrus also, Plato, speaking of the
   truth, shows it as an idea. Now an idea is a conception of God; and
   this the barbarians have termed the Word of God. The words are as
   follow: "For one must then dare to speak the truth, especially in
   speaking of the truth. For the essence of the soul, being colourless,
   formless, and intangible, is visible only to God, [2978] its guide."
   Now the Word issuing forth was the cause of creation; then also he
   generated himself, "when the Word had become flesh," [2979] that He
   might be seen. The righteous man will seek the discovery that flows
   from love, to which if he hastes he prospers. For it is said, "To him
   that knocketh, it shall be opened: ask, and it shall be given to you."
   [2980] "For the violent that storm the kingdom" [2981] are not so in
   disputatious speeches; but by continuance in a right life and unceasing
   prayers, are said "to take it by force," wiping away the blots left by
   their previous sins.


   "You may obtain wickedness, even in great abundance. [2982]

   And him who toils God helps;

   For the gifts of the Muses, hard to win,

   Lie not before you, for any one to bear away."

   The knowledge of ignorance is, then, the first lesson in walking
   according to the Word. An ignorant man has sought, and having sought,
   he finds the teacher; and finding has believed, and believing has
   hoped; and henceforward having loved, is assimilated to what was
   loved--endeavouring to be what he first loved. Such is the method
   Socrates shows Alcibiades, who thus questions: "Do you not think that I
   shall know about what is right otherwise?" "Yes, if you have found
   out." "But you don't think I have found out?" "Certainly, if you have
   sought."

   "Then you don't think that I have sought?" "Yes, if you think you do
   not know." [2983] So with the lamps of the wise virgins, lighted at
   night in the great darkness of ignorance, which the Scripture signified
   by "night." Wise souls, pure as virgins, understanding themselves to be
   situated amidst the ignorance of the world, kindle the light, and rouse
   the mind, and illumine the darkness, and dispel ignorance, and seek
   truth, and await the appearance of the Teacher.


   "The mob, then," said I, "cannot become philosopher." [2984]

   "Many rod-bearers there are, but few Bacchi," according to Plato. "For
   many are called, but few chosen." [2985] "Knowledge is not in all,"
   [2986] says the apostle. "And pray that we may be delivered from
   unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith." [2987] And
   the Poetics of Cleanthes, the Stoic, writes to the following effect:--


   "Look not to glory, wishing to be suddenly wise,

   And fear not the undiscerning and rash opinion of the many;

   For the multitude has not an intelligent, or wise, or right judgment,

   And it is in few men that you will find this." [2988]

   And more sententiously the comic poet briefly says:--


   "It is a shame to judge of what is right by much noise."

   For they heard, I think, that excellent wisdom, which says to us,
   "Watch your opportunity in the midst of the foolish, and in the midst
   of the intelligent continue." [2989] And again, "The wise will conceal
   sense." [2990] For the many demand demonstration as a pledge of truth,
   not satisfied with the bare salvation by faith.


   "But it is strongly incumbent to disbelieve the dominant wicked,

   And as is enjoined by the assurance of our muse,

   Know by dissecting the utterance within your breast."

   "For this is habitual to the wicked," says Empedocles, "to wish to
   overbear what is true by disbelieving it." And that our tenets are
   probable and worthy of belief, the Greeks shall know, the point being
   more thoroughly investigated in what follows. For we are taught what is
   like by what is like. For says Solomon, "Answer a fool according to his
   folly." [2991] Wherefore also, to those that ask the wisdom that is
   with us, we are to hold out things suitable, that with the greatest
   possible ease they may, through their own ideas, be likely to arrive at
   faith in the truth. For "I became all things to all men, that I might
   gain all men." [2992] Since also "the rain" of the divine grace is sent
   down "on the just and the unjust." [2993] "Is He the God of the Jews
   only, and not also of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles: if
   indeed He is one God," [2994] exclaims the noble apostle.

      Chapter IV.--Divine Things Wrapped Up in Figures Both in the Sacred and in
      Heathen Writers.

   But since they will believe neither in what is good justly nor in
   knowledge unto salvation, we ourselves reckoning what they claim as
   belonging to us, because all things are God's; and especially since
   what is good proceeded from us to the Greeks, let us handle those
   things as they are capable of hearing. For intelligence or rectitude
   this great crowd estimates not by truth, but by what they are delighted
   with. And they will be pleased not more with other things than with
   what is like themselves. For he who is still blind and dumb, not having
   understanding, or the undazzled and keen vision of the contemplative
   soul, which the Saviour confers, like the uninitiated at the mysteries,
   or the unmusical at dances, not being yet pure and worthy of the pure
   truth, but still discordant and disordered and material, must stand
   outside of the divine choir. "For we compare spiritual things with
   spiritual." [2995] Wherefore, in accordance with the method of
   concealment, the truly sacred Word, truly divine and most necessary for
   us, deposited in the shrine of truth, was by the Egyptians indicated by
   what were called among them adyta, and by the Hebrews by the veil. Only
   the consecrated--that is, those devoted to God, circumcised in the
   desire of the passions for the sake of love to that which is alone
   divine--were allowed access to them. For Plato also thought it not
   lawful for "the impure to touch the pure."

   Thence the prophecies and oracles are spoken in enigmas, and the
   mysteries are not exhibited incontinently to all and sundry, but only
   after certain purifications and previous instructions.


   "For the Muse was not then

   Greedy of gain or mercenary;

   Nor were Terpsichore's sweet,

   Honey-toned, silvery soft-voiced

   Strains made merchandise of."

   Now those instructed among the Egyptians learned first of all that
   style of the Egyptian letters which is called Epistolographic; and
   second, the Hieratic, which the sacred scribes practice; and finally,
   and last of all, the Hieroglyphic, of which one kind which is by the
   first elements is literal (Kyriologic), and the other Symbolic. Of the
   Symbolic, one kind speaks literally by imitation, and another writes as
   it were figuratively; and another is quite allegorical, using certain
   enigmas.

   Wishing to express Sun in writing, they makea circle; and Moon, a
   figure like the Moon, like its proper shape. But in using the
   figurative style, by transposing and transferring, by changing and by
   transforming in many ways as suits them, they draw characters. In
   relating the praises of the kings in theological myths, they write in
   anaglyphs. [2996] Let the following stand as a specimen of the third
   species--the Enigmatic. For the rest of the stars, on account of their
   oblique course, they have figured like the bodies of serpents; but the
   sun, like that of a beetle, because it makes a round figure of ox-dung,
   [2997] and rolls it before its face. And they say that this creature
   lives six months under ground, and the other division of the year above
   ground, and emits its seed into the ball, and brings forth; and that
   there is not a female beetle. All then, in a word, who have spoken of
   divine things, both Barbarians and Greeks, have veiled the first
   principles of things, and delivered the truth in enigmas, and symbols,
   and allegories, and metaphors, and such like tropes. [2998] Such also
   are the oracles among the Greeks. And the Pythian Apollo is called
   Loxias. Also the maxims of those among the Greeks called wise men, in a
   few sayings indicate the unfolding of matter of considerable
   importance. Such certainly is that maxim, "Spare Time:" either because
   life is short, and we ought not to expend this time in vain; or, on the
   other hand, it bids you spare your personal expenses; so that, though
   you live many years, necessaries may not fail you. Similarly also the
   maxim "Know thyself" shows many things; both that thou art mortal, and
   that thou wast born a human being; and also that, in comparison with
   the other excellences of life, thou art of no account, because thou
   sayest that thou art rich or renowned; or, on the other hand, that,
   being rich or renowned, you are not honoured on account of your
   advantages alone. And it says, Know for what thou wert born, and whose
   image thou art; and what is thy essence, and what thy creation, and
   what thy relation to God, and the like. And the Spirit says by Isaiah
   the prophet, "I will give thee treasures, hidden, dark." [2999] Now
   wisdom, hard to hunt, is the treasures of God and unfailing riches. But
   those, taught in theology by those prophets, the poets, philosophize
   much by way of a hidden sense. I mean Orpheus, Linus, Musæus, Homer,
   and Hesiod, and those in this fashion wise. The persuasive style of
   poetry is for them a veil for the many. Dreams and signs are all more
   or less obscure to men, not from jealousy (for it were wrong to
   conceive of God as subject to passions), but in order that research,
   introducing to the understanding of enigmas, may haste to the discovery
   of truth. Thus Sophocles the tragic poet somewhere says:--


   "And God I know to be such an one,

   Ever the revealer of enigmas to the wise,

   But to the perverse bad, although a teacher in few words,"--

   putting bad instead of simple. Expressly then respecting all our
   Scripture, as if spoken in a parable, it is written in the Psalms,
   "Hear, O My people, My law: incline your ear to the words of My mouth.
   I will open My mouth in parables, I will utter My problems from the
   beginning." [3000] Similarly speaks the noble apostle to the following
   effect: "Howbeit we speak wisdom among those that are perfect; yet not
   the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come
   to nought. But we speak the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery; which
   none of the princes of this world knew. For had they known it, they
   would not have crucified the Lord of glory." [3001]

   The philosophers did not exert themselves in contemning the appearance
   of the Lord. It therefore follows that it is the opinion of the wise
   among the Jews which the apostle inveighs against. Wherefore he adds,
   "But we preach, as it is written, what eye hath not seen, and ear hath
   not heard, and hath not entered into the heart of man, what God hath
   prepared for them that love Him. For God hath revealed it to us by the
   Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, even the deep things of
   God." [3002] For he recognises the spiritual man and the Gnostic as the
   disciple of the Holy Spirit dispensed by God, which is the mind of
   Christ. "But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit,
   for they are foolishness to him." [3003] Now the apostle, in
   contradistinction to gnostic perfection, calls the common faith [3004]
   the foundation, and sometimes milk, writing on this wise: "Brethren, I
   could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, to babes in
   Christ. I have fed you with milk, not with meat: for ye were not able.
   Neither yet are ye now able. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there
   is among you envy and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?"
   [3005] Which things are the choice of those men who are sinners. But
   those who abstain from these things give their thoughts to divine
   things, and partake of gnostic food. "According to the grace," it is
   said, "given to me as a wise master builder, I have laid the
   foundation. And another buildeth on it gold and silver, precious
   stones." [3006] Such is the gnostic superstructure on the foundation of
   faith in Christ Jesus. But "the stubble, and the wood, and the hay,"
   are the additions of heresies. "But the fire shall try every man's
   work, of what sort it is." In allusion to the gnostic edifice also in
   the Epistle to the Romans, he says, "For I desire to see you, that I
   may impart unto you a spiritual gift, that ye may be established."
   [3007] It was impossible that gifts of this sort could be written
   without disguise.

      Chapter V.--On the Symbols of Pythagoras.

   Now the Pythagorean symbols were connected with the Barbarian
   philosophy in the most recondite way. For instance, the Samian counsels
   "not to have a swallow in the house;" that is, not to receive a
   loquacious, whispering, garrulous man, who cannot contain what has been
   communicated to him. "For the swallow, and the turtle, and the sparrows
   of the field, know the times of their entrance," [3008] says the
   Scripture; and one ought never to dwell with trifles. And the
   turtle-dove murmuring shows the thankless slander of fault-finding, and
   is rightly expelled the house.


   "Don't mutter against me, sitting by one in one place, another in
   another." [3009]

   The swallow too, which suggests the fable of Pandion, seeing it is
   right to detest the incidents reported of it, some of which we hear
   Tereus suffered, and some of which he inflicted. It pursues also the
   musical grasshoppers, whence he who is a persecutor of the word ought
   to be driven away.


   "By sceptre-bearing Here, whose eye surveys Olympus,

   I have a rusty closet for tongues,"

   says Poetry. Æschylus also says:--


   "But, I, too, have a key as a guard on my tongue."

   Again Pythagoras commanded, "When the pot is lifted off the fire, not
   to leave its mark in the ashes, but to scatter them;" and "people on
   getting up from bed, to shake the bed-clothes." For he intimated that
   it was necessary not only to efface the mark, but not to leave even a
   trace of anger; and that on its ceasing to boil, it was to be composed,
   and all memory of injury to be wiped out. "And let not the sun," says
   the Scripture, "go down upon your wrath." [3010] And he that said,
   "Thou shall not desire," [3011] took away all memory of wrong; for
   wrath is found to be the impulse of concupiscence in a mild soul,
   especially seeking irrational revenge. In the same way "the bed is
   ordered to be shaken up," so that there may be no recollection of
   effusion in sleep, [3012] or sleep in the day-time; nor, besides, of
   pleasure during the night. And he intimated that the vision of the dark
   ought to be dissipated speedily by the light of truth. "Be angry, and
   sin not," says David, teaching us that we ought not to assent to the
   impression, and not to follow it up by action, and so confirm wrath.

   Again, "Don't sail on land" is a Pythagorean saw, and shows that taxes
   and similar contracts, being troublesome and fluctuating, ought to be
   declined. Wherefore also the Word says that the tax-gatherers shall be
   saved with difficulty. [3013]

   And again, "Don't wear a ring, nor engrave on it the images of the
   gods," enjoins Pythagoras; as Moses ages before enacted expressly, that
   neither a graven, nor molten, nor moulded, nor painted likeness should
   be made; so that we may not cleave to things of sense, but pass to
   intellectual objects: for familiarity with the sight disparages the
   reverence of what is divine; and to worship that which is immaterial by
   matter, is to dishonour it by sense. [3014] Wherefore the wisest of the
   Egyptian priests decided that the temple of Athene should be hypæthral,
   just as the Hebrews constructed the temple without an image. And some,
   in worshipping God, make a representation of heaven containing the
   stars; and so worship, although Scripture says, "Let Us make man in Our
   image and likeness." [3015] I think it worth while also to adduce the
   utterance of Eurysus the Pythagorean, which is as follows, who in his
   book On Fortune, having said that the "Creator, on making man, took
   Himself as an exemplar," added, "And the body is like the other things,
   as being made of the same material, and fashioned by the best workman,
   who wrought it, taking Himself as the archetype." And, in fine,
   Pythagoras and his followers, with Plato also, and most of the other
   philosophers, were best acquainted with the Lawgiver, as may be
   concluded from their doctrine. And by a happy utterance of divination,
   not without divine help, concurring in certain prophetic declarations,
   and, seizing the truth in portions and aspects, in terms not obscure,
   and not going beyond the explanation of the things, they honoured it on
   as certaining the appearance of relation with the truth. Whence the
   Hellenic philosophy is like the torch of wick which men kindle,
   artificially stealing the light from the sun. But on the proclamation
   of the Word all that holy light shone forth. Then in houses by night
   the stolen light is useful; but by day the fire blazes, and all the
   night is illuminated by such a sun of intellectual light.

   Now Pythagoras made an epitome of the statements on righteousness in
   Moses, when he said, "Do not step over the balance;" that is, do not
   transgress equality in distribution, honouring justice so.


   "Which friends to friends for ever, binds,

   To cities, cities--to allies, allies,

   For equality is what is right for men;

   But less to greater ever hostile grows,

   And days of hate begin,"

   as is said with poetic grace.

   Wherefore the Lord says, "Take My yoke, for it is gentle and light."
   [3016] And on the disciples, striving for the pre-eminence, He enjoins
   equality with simplicity, saying "that they must become as little
   children." [3017] Likewise also the apostle writes, that "no one in
   Christ is bond or free, or Greek or Jew. For the creation in Christ
   Jesus is new, is equality, free of strife--not grasping--just." For
   envy, and jealousy, and bitterness, stand without the divine choir.

   Thus also those skilled in the mysteries forbid "to eat the heart;"
   teaching that we ought not to gnaw and consume the soul by idleness and
   by vexation, on account of things which happen against one's wishes.
   Wretched, accordingly, was the man whom Homer also says, wandering
   alone, "ate his own heart." But again, seeing the Gospel supposes two
   ways--the apostles, too, similarly with all the prophets--and seeing
   they call that one "narrow and confined" which is circumscribed
   according to the commandments and prohibitions, and the opposite one,
   which leads to perdition, "broad and roomy," open to pleasures and
   wrath, and say, "Blessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of
   the ungodly, and standeth not in the way of sinners." [3018] Hence also
   comes the fable of Prodicus of Ceus about Virtue and Vice. [3019] And
   Pythagoras shrinks not from prohibiting to walk on the public
   thoroughfares, enjoining the necessity of not following the sentiments
   of the many, which are crude and inconsistent. And Aristocritus, in the
   first book of his Positions against Heracliodorus, mentions a letter to
   this effect: "Atoeeas king of the Scythians to the people of Byzantium:
   Do not impair my revenues in case my mares drink your water;" for the
   Barbarian indicated symbolically that he would make war on them.
   Likewise also the poet Euphorion introduces Nestor saying,--


   "We have not yet wet the Achæan steeds in Simois."

   Therefore also the Egyptians place Sphinxes [3020] before their
   temples, to signify that the doctrine respecting God is enigmatical and
   obscure; perhaps also that we ought both to love and fear the Divine
   Being: to love Him as gentle and benign to the pious; to fear Him as
   inexorably just to the impious; for the sphinx shows the image of a
   wild beast and of a man together.

      Chapter VI.--The Mystic Meaning of the Tabernacle and Its Furniture.

   It were tedious to go over all the Prophets and the Law, specifying
   what is spoken in enigmas; for almost the whole Scripture gives its
   utterances in this way. It may suffice, I think, for any one possessed
   of intelligence, for the proof of the point in hand, to select a few
   examples.

   Now concealment is evinced in the reference of the seven circuits
   around the temple, which are made mention of among the Hebrews; and the
   equipment on the robe, indicating by the various symbols, which had
   reference to visible objects, the agreement which from heaven reaches
   down to earth. And the covering and the veil were variegated with blue,
   and purple, and scarlet, and linen. And so it was suggested that the
   nature of the elements contained the revelation of God. For purple is
   from water, linen from the earth; blue, being dark, is like the air, as
   scarlet is like fire.

   In the midst of the covering and veil, where the priests were allowed
   to enter, was situated the altar of incense, the symbol of the earth
   placed in the middle of this universe; and from it came the fumes of
   incense. And that place intermediate between the inner veil, where the
   high priest alone, on prescribed days, was permitted to enter, and the
   external court which surrounded it--free to all the Hebrews--was, they
   say, the middlemost point of heaven and earth. But others say it was
   the symbol of the intellectual world, and that of sense. The covering,
   then, the barrier of popular unbelief, was stretched in front of the
   five pillars, keeping back those in the surrounding space.

   So very mystically the five loaves are broken by the Saviour, and fill
   the crowd of the listeners. For great is the crowd that keep to the
   things of sense, as if they were the only things in existence. "Cast
   your eyes round, and see," says Plato, "that none of the uninitiated
   listen." Such are they who think that nothing else exists, but what
   they can hold tight with their hands; but do not admit as in the
   department of existence, actions and processes of generation, and the
   whole of the unseen. For such are those who keep by the five senses.
   But the knowledge of God is a thing inaccessible to the ears and like
   organs of this kind of people. Hence the Son is said to be the Father's
   face, being the revealer of the Father's character to the five senses
   by clothing Himself with flesh. "But if we live in the Spirit, let us
   also walk in the Spirit." [3021] "For we walk by faith, not by sight,"
   [3022] the noble apostle says. Within the veil, then, is concealed the
   sacerdotal service; and it keeps those engaged in it far from those
   without.

   Again, there is the veil of the entrance into the holy of holies. Four
   pillars there are, the sign of the sacred tetrad of the ancient
   covenants. [3023] Further, the mystic name of four letters which was
   affixed to those alone to whom the adytum was accessible, is called
   Jave, which is interpreted, "Who is and shall be." The name of God,
   too, among the Greeks contains four letters.

   Now the Lord, having come alone into the intellectual world, enters by
   His sufferings, introduced into the knowledge of the Ineffable,
   ascending above every name which is known by sound. The lamp, too, was
   placed to the south of the altar of incense; and by it were shown the
   motions of the seven planets, that perform their revolutions towards
   the south. For three branches rose on either side of the lamp, and
   lights on them; since also the sun, like the lamp, set in the midst of
   all the planets, dispenses with a kind of divine music the light to
   those above and to those below.

   The golden lamp conveys another enigma as a symbol of Christ, not in
   respect of form alone, but in his casting light, "at sundry times and
   divers manners," [3024] on those who believe on Him and hope, and who
   see by means of the ministry of the First-born. And they say that the
   seven eyes of the Lord "are the seven spirits resting on the rod that
   springs from the root of Jesse." [3025]

   North of the altar of incense was placed a table, on which there was
   "the exhibition of the loaves;" for the most nourishing of the winds
   are those of the north. And thus are signified certain seats of
   churches conspiring so as to form one body and one assemblage. [3026]

   And the things recorded of the sacred ark signify the properties of the
   world of thought, which is hidden and closed to the many.

   And those golden figures, each of them with six wings, signify either
   the two bears, as some will have it, or rather the two hemispheres. And
   the name cherubim meant "much knowledge." But both together have twelve
   wings, and by the zodiac and time, which moves on it, point out the
   world of sense. It is of them, I think, that Tragedy, discoursing of
   Nature, says:--


   "Unwearied Time circles full in perennial flow,

   Producing itself. And the twin-bears

   On the swift wandering motions of their wings,

   Keep the Atlantean pole."

   And Atlas, [3027] the unsuffering pole, may mean the fixed sphere, or
   better perhaps, motionless eternity. But I think it better to regard
   the ark, so called from the Hebrew word Thebotha, [3028] as signifying
   something else. It is interpreted, one instead of one in all places.
   Whether, then, it is the eighth region and the world of thought, or
   God, all-embracing, and without shape, and invisible, that is
   indicated, we may for the present defer saying. But it signifies the
   repose which dwells with the adoring spirits, which are meant by the
   cherubim.

   For He who prohibited the making of a graven image, would never Himself
   have made an image in the likeness of holy things. [3029] Nor is there
   at all any composite thing, and creature endowed with sensation, of the
   sort in heaven. But the face is a symbol of the rational soul, and the
   wings are the lofty ministers and energies of powers right and left;
   and the voice is delightsome glory in ceaseless contemplation. Let it
   suffice that the mystic interpretation has advanced so far.

   Now the high priest's robe is the symbol of the world of sense. The
   seven planets are represented by the five stones and the two
   carbuncles, for Saturn and the Moon. The former is southern, and moist,
   and earthy, and heavy; the latter aerial, whence she is called by some
   Artemis, as if Ærotomos (cutting the air); and the air is cloudy. And
   cooperating as they did in the production of things here below, those
   that by Divine Providence are set over the planets are rightly
   represented as placed on the breast and shoulders; and by them was the
   work of creation, the first week. And the breast is the seat of the
   heart and soul.

   Differently, the stones might be the various phases of salvation; some
   occupying the upper, some the lower parts of the entire body saved. The
   three hundred and sixty bells, suspended from the robe, is the space of
   a year, "the acceptable year of the Lord," proclaiming and resounding
   the stupendous manifestation of the Saviour. Further, the broad gold
   mitre indicates the regal power of the Lord, "since the Head of the
   Church" is the Saviour. [3030] The mitre that is on it [i.e., the head]
   is, then, a sign of most princely rule; and otherwise we have heard it
   said, "The Head of Christ is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
   Christ." [3031] Moreover, there was the breastplate, comprising the
   ephod, which is the symbol of work, and the oracle (logion); and this
   indicated the Word (logos) by which it was framed, and is the symbol of
   heaven, made by the Word, [3032] and subjected to Christ, the Head of
   all things, inasmuch as it moves in the same way, and in a like manner.
   The luminous emerald stones, therefore, in the ephod, signify the sun
   and moon, the helpers of nature. The shoulder, I take it, is the
   commencement of the hand.

   The twelve stones, set in four rows on the breast, describe for us the
   circle of the zodiac, in the four changes of the year. It was otherwise
   requisite that the law and the prophets should be placed beneath the
   Lord's head, because in both Testaments mention is made of the
   righteous. For were we to say that the apostles were at once prophets
   and righteous, we should say well, "since one and the self-same Holy
   Spirit works in all." [3033] And as the Lord is above the whole world,
   yea, above the world of thought, so the name engraven on the plate has
   been regarded to signify, above all rule and authority; and it was
   inscribed with reference both to the written commandments and the
   manifestation to sense. And it is the name of God that is expressed;
   since, as the Son sees the goodness of the Father, God the Saviour
   works, being called the first principle of all things, which was imaged
   forth from the invisible God first, and before the ages, and which
   fashioned all things which came into being after itself. Nay more, the
   oracle [3034] exhibits the prophecy which by the Word cries and
   preaches, and the judgment that is to come; since it is the same Word
   which prophesies, and judges, and discriminates all things.

   And they say that the robe prophesied the ministry in the flesh, by
   which He was seen in closer relation to the world. So the high priest,
   putting off his consecrated robe (the universe, and the creation in the
   universe, were consecrated by Him assenting that, what was made, was
   good), washes himself, and puts on the other tunic--a holy-of-holies
   one, so to speak--which is to accompany him into the adytum;
   exhibiting, as seems to me, the Levite and Gnostic, as the chief of
   other priests (those bathed in water, and clothed in faith alone, and
   expecting their own individual abode), himself distinguishing the
   objects of the intellect from the things of sense, rising above other
   priests, hasting to the entrance to the world of ideas, to wash himself
   from the things here below, not in water, as formerly one was cleansed
   on being enrolled in the tribe of Levi. But purified already by the
   gnostic Word in his whole heart, and thoroughly regulated, and having
   improved that mode of life received from the priest to the highest
   pitch, being quite sanctified both in word and life, and having put on
   the bright array of glory, and received the ineffable inheritance of
   that spiritual and perfect man, "which eye hath not seen and ear hath
   not heard, and it hath not entered into the heart of man;" and having
   become son and friend, he is now replenished with insatiable
   contemplation face to face. For there is nothing like hearing the Word
   Himself, who by means of the Scripture inspires fuller intelligence.
   For so it is said, "And he shall put off the linen robe, which he had
   put on when he entered into the holy place; and shall lay it aside
   there, and wash his body in water in the holy place, and put on his
   robe." [3035] But in one way, as I think, the Lord puts off and puts on
   by descending into the region of sense; and in another, he who through
   Him has believed puts off and puts on, as the apostle intimated, the
   consecrated stole. Thence, after the image of the Lord the worthiest
   were chosen from the sacred tribes to be high priests, and those
   elected to the kingly office and to prophecy were anointed.

      Chapter VII.--The Egyptian Symbols and Enigmas of Sacred Things.

   Whence also the Egyptians did not entrust the mysteries they possessed
   to all and sundry, and did not divulge the knowledge of divine things
   to the profane; but only to those destined to ascend the throne, and
   those of the priests that were judged the worthiest, from their
   nurture, culture, and birth. Similar, then, to the Hebrew enigmas in
   respect to concealment, are those of the Egyptians also. Of the
   Egyptians, some show the sun on a ship, others on a crocodile. And they
   signify hereby, that the sun, making a passage through the delicious
   and moist air, generates time; which is symbolized by the crocodile in
   some other sacerdotal account. Further, at Diospolis in Egypt, on the
   temple called Pylon, there was figured a boy as the symbol of
   production, and an old man as that of decay. A hawk, on the other hand,
   was the symbol of God, as a fish of hate; and, according to a different
   symbolism, the crocodile of impudence. The whole symbol, then, when put
   together, appears to teach this: "Oh ye who are born and die, God hates
   impudence."

   And there are those who fashion ears and eyes of costly material, and
   consecrate them, dedicating them in the temples to the gods--by this
   plainly indicating that God sees and hears all things. Besides, the
   lion is with them the symbol of strength and prowess, as the ox clearly
   is of the earth itself, and husbandry and food, and the horse of
   fortitude and confidence; while, on the other hand, the sphinx, of
   strength combined with intelligence--as it had a body entirely that of
   a lion, and the face of a man. Similarly to these, to indicate
   intelligence, and memory, and power, and art, a man is sculptured in
   the temples. And in what is called among them the Komasiæ of the gods,
   they carry about golden images--two dogs, one hawk, and one ibis; and
   the four figures of the images they call four letters. For the dogs are
   symbols of the two hemispheres, which, as it were, go round and keep
   watch; the hawk, of the sun, for it is fiery and destructive (so they
   attribute pestilential diseases to the sun); the ibis, of the moon,
   likening the shady parts to that which is dark in plumage, and the
   luminous to the light. And some will have it that by the dogs are meant
   the tropics, which guard and watch the sun's passage to the south and
   north. The hawk signifies the equinoctial line, which is high and
   parched with heat, as the ibis the ecliptic. For the ibis seems, above
   other animals, to have furnished to the Egyptians the first rudiments
   of the invention of number and measure, as the oblique line did of
   circles.

      Chapter VIII.--The Use of the Symbolic Style by Poets and Philosophers.

   But it was not only the most highly intellectual of the Egyptians, but
   also such of other barbarians as prosecuted philosophy, that affected
   the symbolical style. They say, then, that Idanthuris king of the
   Scythians, as Pherecydes of Syros relates, sent to Darius, on his
   passing the Ister in threat of war, a symbol, instead of a letter,
   consisting of a mouse, a frog, a bird, a javelin, a plough. And there
   being a doubt in reference to them, as was to be expected, Orontopagas
   the Chiliarch said that they were to resign the kingdom; taking
   dwellings to be meant by the mouse, waters by the frog, air by the
   bird, land by the plough, arms by the javelin. But Xiphodres
   interpreted the contrary; for he said, "If we do not take our flight
   like birds, or like mice get below the earth, or like frogs beneath the
   water, we shall not escape their arrows; for we are not lords of the
   territory."

   It is said that Anacharsis the Scythian, while asleep, covered the
   pudenda with his left hand, and his mouth with his right, to intimate
   that both ought to be mastered, but that it was a greater thing to
   master the tongue than voluptuousness.

   And why should I linger over the barbarians, when I can adduce the
   Greeks as exceedingly addicted to the use of the method of concealment?
   Androcydes the Pythagorean says the far-famed so-called Ephesian
   letters were of the class of symbols. For he said that askion
   (shadowless) meant darkness, for it has no shadow; and kataskion
   (shadowy) light, since it casts with its rays the shadow; and lix if is
   the earth, according to an ancient appellation; and tetras is the year,
   in reference to the seasons; and damnameneus is the sun, which
   overpowers (damazon); and ta aisia is the true voice. And then the
   symbol intimates that divine things have been arranged in harmonious
   order--darkness to light, the sun to the year, and the earth to
   nature's processes of production of every sort. Also Dionysius Thrax,
   the grammarian, in his book, Respecting the Exposition of the
   Symbolical Signification in Circles, says expressly, "Some signified
   actions not by words only, but also by symbols: by words, as is the
   case of what are called the Delphic maxims, Nothing in excess,' Know
   thyself,' and the like; and by symbols, as the wheel that is turned in
   the temples of the gods, derived from the Egyptians, and the branches
   that are given to the worshippers. For the Thracian Orpheus says:--


   "Whatever works of branches are a care to men on earth,

   Not one has one fate in the mind, but all things

   Revolve around; and it is not lawful to stand at one point,

   But each one keeps an equal part of the race as they began."

   The branches either stand as the symbol of the first food, or they are
   that the multitude may know that fruits spring and grow universally,
   remaining a very long time; but that the duration of life allotted to
   themselves is brief. And it is on this account that they will have it
   that the branches are given; and perhaps also that they may know, that
   as these, on the other hand, are burned, so also they themselves
   speedily leave this life, and will become fuel for fire.

   Very useful, then, is the mode of symbolic interpretation for many
   purposes; and it is helpful to the right theology, and to piety, and to
   the display of intelligence, and the practice of brevity, and the
   exhibition of wisdom. "For the use of symbolical speech is
   characteristic of the wise man," appositely remarks the grammarian
   Didymus, "and the explanation of what is signified by it." And indeed
   the most elementary instruction of children embraces the interpretation
   of the four elements; for it is said that the Phrygians call water
   Bedu, as also Orpheus says: [3036] --


   "And bright water is poured down, the Bedu of the nymphs."

   Dion Thytes also seems to write similarly:--


   And taking Bedu, pour it on your hands, and turn to divination."

   On the other hand, the comic poet, Philydeus, understands by Bedu the
   air, as being (Biodoros) life-giver, in the following lines:--


   "I pray that I may inhale the salutary Bedu,

   Which is the most essential part of health;

   Inhale the pure, the unsullied air."

   In the same opinion also concurs Neanthes of Cyzicum, who writes that
   the Macedonian priests invoke Bedu, which they interpret to mean the
   air, to be propitious to them and to their children. And Zaps some have
   ignorantly taken for fire (from zesin, boiling); for so the sea is
   called, as Euphorion, in his reply to Theoridas:--


   "And Zaps, destroyer of ships, wrecked it on the rocks."

   And Dionysius Iambus similarly:--


   "Briny Zaps moans about the maddened deep."

   Similarly Cratinus the younger, the comic poet:--


   "Zaps casts forth shrimps and little fishes."

   And Simmias of Rhodes:--


   "Parent of the Ignetes and the Telchines briny Zaps was born." [3037]

   And chthon is the earth (kechumene) spread forth to bigness. And
   Plectron, according to some, is the sky (polos), according to others,
   it is the air, which strikes (plessonta) and moves to nature and
   increase, and which fills all things. But these have not read Cleanthes
   the philosopher, who expressly calls Plectron the sun; for darting his
   beams in the east, as if striking the world, he leads the light to its
   harmonious course. And from the sun it signifies also the rest of the
   stars.

   And the Sphinx is not the comprehension [3038] of the universe, and the
   revolution of the world, according to the poet Aratus; but perhaps it
   is the spiritual tone which pervades and holds together the universe.
   But it is better to regard it as the ether, which holds together and
   presses all things; as also Empedocles says:--


   "But come now, first will I speak of the Sun, the first principle of
   all things,

   From which all, that we look upon, has sprung,

   Both earth, and billowy deep, and humid air;

   Titan and Ether too, which binds all things around."

   And Apollodorus of Corcyra says that these lines were recited by
   Branchus the seer, when purifying the Milesians from plague; for he,
   sprinkling the multitude with branches of laurel, led off the hymn
   somehow as follows:--


   "Sing Boys Hecaergus and Hecaerga."

   And the people accompanied him, saying, "Bedu, [3039] Zaps, Chthon,
   Plectron, Sphinx, Cnaxzbi, Chthyptes, Phlegmos, Drops." Callimachus
   relates the story in iambics. Cnaxzbi is, by derivation, the plague,
   from its gnawing (knaiein) and destroying (diaphtheirein), and thupsai
   is to consume with a thunderbolt. Thespis the tragic poet says that
   something else was signified by these, writing thus: "Lo, I offer to
   thee a libation of white Cnaxzbi, having pressed it from the yellow
   nurses. Lo, to thee, O two-horned Pan, mixing Chthyptes cheese with red
   honey, I place it on thy sacred altars. Lo, to thee I pour as a
   libation the sparkling gleam of Bromius." He signifies, as I think, the
   soul's first milk-like nutriment of the four-and-twenty elements, after
   which solidified milk comes as food. And last, he teaches of the blood
   of the vine of the Word, the sparkling wine, the perfecting gladness of
   instruction. And Drops is the operating Word, which, beginning with
   elementary training, and advancing to the growth of the man, inflames
   and illumines man up to the measure of maturity.

   The third is said to be a writing copy for children--marptes, sphinx,
   klops, zunchthedon. And it signifies, in my opinion, that by the
   arrangement of the elements and of the world, we must advance to the
   knowledge of what is more perfect, since eternal salvation is attained
   by force and toil; for marpsai is to grasp. And the harmony of the
   world is meant by the Sphinx; and zunchthedon means difficulty; and
   klopss means at once the secret knowledge of the Lord and day. Well!
   does not Epigenes, in his book on the Poetry of Orpheus, in exhibiting
   the peculiarities found in Orpheus, [3040] say that by "the curved
   rods" (keraisi) is meant "ploughs;" and by the warp (stemosi), the
   furrows; and the woof (mitos) is a figurative expression for the seed;
   and that the tears of Zeus signify a shower; and that the "parts"
   (moirai) are, again, the phases of the moon, the thirtieth day, and the
   fifteenth, and the new moon, and that Orpheus accordingly calls them
   "white-robed," as being parts of the light? Again, that the Spring is
   called "flowery," from its nature; and Night "still," on account of
   rest; and the Moon "Gorgonian," on account of the face in it; and that
   the time in which it is necessary to sow is called Aphrodite by the
   "Theologian." [3041] In the same way, too, the Pythagoreans
   figuratively called the planets the "dogs of Persephone;" and to the
   sea they applied the metaphorical appellation of "the tears of Kronus."
   Myriads on myriads of enigmatical utterances by both poets and
   philosophers are to be found; and there are also whole books which
   present the mind of the writer veiled, as that of Heraclitus On Nature,
   who on this very account is called "Obscure." Similar to this book is
   the Theology of Pherecydes of Syrus; for Euphorion the poet, and the
   Causes of Callimachus, and the Alexandra of Lycophron, and the like,
   are proposed as an exercise in exposition to all the grammarians.

   It is, then, proper that the Barbarian philosophy, on which it is our
   business to speak, should prophesy also obscurely and by symbols, as
   was evinced. Such are the injunctions of Moses: "These common things,
   the sow, the hawk, the eagle, and the raven, are not to be eaten."
   [3042] For the sow is the emblem of voluptuous and unclean lust of
   food, and lecherous and filthy licentiousness in venery, always
   prurient, and material, and lying in the mire, and fattening for
   slaughter and destruction.

   Again, he commands to eat that which parts the hoof and ruminates;
   "intimating," says Barnabas, "that we ought to cleave to those who fear
   the Lord, and meditate in their heart on that portion of the word which
   they have received, to those who speak and keep the Lord's statutes, to
   those to whom meditation is a work of gladness, and who ruminate on the
   word of the Lord. And what is the parted hoof? That the righteous walks
   in this world, and expects the holy eternity to come." Then he adds,
   "See how well Moses enacted. But whence could they understand or
   comprehend these things? We who have rightly understood speak the
   commandments as the Lord wished; wherefore He circumcised our ears and
   hearts, that we may comprehend these things. And when he says, Thou
   shalt not eat the eagle, the hawk, the kite, and the crow;' he says,
   Thou shalt not adhere to or become like those men who know not how to
   procure for themselves subsistence by toil and sweat, but live by
   plunder, and lawlessly.' For the eagle indicates robbery, the hawk
   injustice, and the raven greed. It is also written, With the innocent
   man thou wilt be innocent, and with the chosen choice, and with the
   perverse thou shall pervert.' [3043] It is incumbent on us to cleave to
   the saints, because they that cleave to them shall be sanctified."
   [3044]

   Thence Theognis writes:--


   "For from the good you will learn good things;

   But if you mix with the bad, you will destroy any mind you may have."

   And when, again, it is said in the ode, "For He hath triumphed
   gloriously: the horse and his rider hath He cast into the sea;" [3045]
   the many-limbed and brutal affection, lust, with the rider mounted, who
   gives the reins to pleasures, "He has cast into the sea," throwing them
   away into the disorders of the world. Thus also Plato, in his book On
   the Soul, says that the charioteer and the horse that ran off--the
   irrational part, which is divided in two, into anger and
   concupiscence--fall down; and so the myth intimates that it was through
   the licentiousness of the steeds that Phaëthon was thrown out. Also in
   the case of Joseph: the brothers having envied this young man, who by
   his knowledge was possessed of uncommon foresight, stripped off the
   coat of many colours, and took and threw him into a pit (the pit was
   empty, it had no water), rejecting the good man's varied knowledge,
   springing from his love of instruction; or, in the exercise of the bare
   faith, which is according to the law, they threw him into the pit empty
   of water, selling him into Egypt, which was destitute of the divine
   word. And the pit was destitute of knowledge; into which being thrown
   and stript of his knowledge, he that had become unconsciously wise,
   stript of knowledge, seemed like his brethren. Otherwise interpreted,
   the coat of many colours is lust, which takes its way into a yawning
   pit. "And if one open up or hew out a pit," it is said, "and do not
   cover it, and there fall in there a calf or ass, the owner of the pit
   shall pay the price in money, and give it to his neighbour; and the
   dead body shall be his. [3046] Here add that prophecy: "The ox knoweth
   his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not
   understood Me." [3047] In order, then, that none of those, who have
   fallen in with the knowledge taught by thee, may become incapable of
   holding the truth, and disobey and fall away, it is said, Be thou sure
   in the treatment of the word, and shut up the living spring in the
   depth from those who approach irrationally, but reach drink to those
   that thirst for truth. Conceal it, then, from those who are unfit to
   receive the depth of knowledge, and so cover the pit. The owner of the
   pit, then, the Gnostic, shall himself be punished, incurring the blame
   of the others stumbling, and of being overwhelmed by the greatness of
   the word, he himself being of small capacity; or transferring the
   worker into the region of speculation, and on that account dislodging
   him from off-hand faith. "And will pay money," rendering a reckoning,
   and submitting his accounts to the "omnipotent Will."

   This, then, is the type of "the law and the prophets which were until
   John;" [3048] while he, though speaking more perspicuously as no longer
   prophesying, but pointing out as now present, Him, who was proclaimed
   symbolically from the beginning, nevertheless said, "I am not worthy to
   loose the latchet of the Lord's shoe." [3049] For he confesses that he
   is not worthy to baptize so great a Power; for it behooves those, who
   purify others, to free the soul from the body and its sins, as the foot
   from the thong. Perhaps also this signified the final exertion of the
   Saviour's power toward us--the immediate, I mean--that by His presence,
   concealed in the enigma of prophecy, inasmuch as he, by pointing out to
   sight Him that had been prophesied of, and indicating the Presence
   which had come, walking forth into the light, loosed the latchet of the
   oracles of the [old] economy, by unveiling the meaning of the symbols.

   And the observances practiced by the Romans in the case of wills have a
   place here; those balances and small coins to denote justice, and
   freeing of slaves, and rubbing of the ears. For these observances are,
   that things may be transacted with justice; and those for the
   dispensing of honour; and the last, that he who happens to be near, as
   if a burden were imposed on him, should stand and hear and take the
   post of mediator.

      Chapter IX.--Reasons for Veiling the Truth in Symbols.

   But, as appears, I have, in my eagerness to establish my point,
   insensibly gone beyond what is requisite. For life would fail me to
   adduce the multitude of those who philosophize in a symbolical manner.
   For the sake, then, of memory and brevity, and of attracting to the
   truth, such are the Scriptures of the Barbarian philosophy.

   For only to those who often approach them, and have given them a trial
   by faith and in their whole life, will they supply the real philosophy
   and the true theology. They also wish us to require an interpreter and
   guide. For so they considered, that, receiving truth at the hands of
   those who knew it well, we would be more earnest and less liable to
   deception, and those worthy of them would profit. Besides, all things
   that shine through a veil show the truth grander and more imposing; as
   fruits shining through water, and figures through veils, which give
   added reflections to them. For, in addition to the fact that things
   unconcealed are perceived in one way, the rays of light shining round
   reveal defects. Since, then, we may draw several meanings, as we do
   from what is expressed in veiled form, such being the case, the
   ignorant and unlearned man fails. But the Gnostior apprehends. Now,
   then, it is not wished that all things should be exposed
   indiscriminately to all and sundry, or the benefits of wisdom
   communicated to those who have not even in a dream been purified in
   soul, (for it is not allowed to hand to every chance comer what has
   been procured with such laborious efforts); nor are the mysteries of
   the word to be expounded to the profane.

   They say, then, that Hipparchus the Pythagorean, being guilty of
   writing the tenets of Pythagoras in plain language, was expelled from
   the school, and a pillar raised for him as if he had been dead.
   Wherefore also in the Barbarian philosophy they call those dead who
   have fallen away from the dogmas, and have placed the mind in
   subjection to carnal passions. "For what fellowship hath righteousness
   and iniquity?" according to the divine apostle. "Or what communion hath
   light with darkness? or what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what
   portion hath the believer with the unbeliever?" [3050] For the honours
   of the Olympians and of mortals lie apart. "Wherefore also go forth
   from the midst of them, and be separated, saith the Lord, and touch not
   the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be to you for a
   Father, and ye shall be my sons and daughters." [3051]

   It was not only the Pythagoreans and Plato then, that concealed many
   things; but the Epicureans too say that they have things that may not
   be uttered, and do not allow all to peruse those writings. The Stoics
   also say that by the first Zeno things were written which they do not
   readily allow disciples to read, without their first giving proof
   whether or not they are genuine philosophers. And the disciples of
   Aristotle say that some of their treatises are esoteric, and others
   common and exoteric. Further, those who instituted the mysteries, being
   philosophers, buried their doctrines in myths, so as not to be obvious
   to all. Did they then, by veiling human opinions, prevent the ignorant
   from handling them; and was it not more beneficial for the holy and
   blessed contemplation of realities to be concealed? But it was not only
   the tenets of the Barbarian philosophy, or the Pythagorean myths. But
   even those myths in Plato (in the Republic, that of Hero the Armenian;
   and in the Gorgias, that of Æacus and Rhadamanthus; and in the Phædo,
   that of Tartarus; and in the Protagoras, that of Prometheus and
   Epimetheus; and besides these, that of the war between the Atlantini
   and the Athenians in the Atlanticum) are to be expounded allegorically,
   not absolutely in all their expressions, but in those which express the
   general sense. And these we shall find indicated by symbols under the
   veil of allegory. Also the association of Pythagoras, and the twofold
   intercourse with the associates which designates the majority, hearers
   (akousmatikoi), and the others that have a genuine attachment to
   philosophy, disciples (mathematikoi), yet signified that something was
   spoken to the multitude, and something concealed from them. Perchance,
   too, the twofold species of the Peripatetic teaching--that called
   probable, and that called knowable--came very near the distinction
   between opinion on the one hand, and glory and truth on the other.


   "To win the flowers of fair renown from men,

   Be not induced to speak aught more than right."

   The Ionic muses accordingly expressly say, "That the majority of
   people, wise in their own estimation, follow minstrels and make use of
   laws, knowing that many are bad, few good; but that the best pursue
   glory: for the best make choice of the everlasting glory of men above
   all. But the multitude cram themselves like brutes, measuring happiness
   by the belly and the pudenda, and the basest things in us." And the
   great Parmenides of Elea is introduced describing thus the teaching of
   the two ways:--


   "The one is the dauntless heart of convincing truth;

   The other is in the opinions of men, in whom is no true faith."

      Chapter X.--The Opinion of the Apostles on Veiling the Mysteries of the
      Faith.

   Rightly, therefore, the divine apostle says, "By revelation the mystery
   was made known to me (as I wrote before in brief, in accordance with
   which, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of
   Christ), which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as
   it is now revealed to His holy apostles and prophets." [3052] For there
   is an instruction of the perfect, of which, writing to the Colossians,
   he says, "We cease not to pray for you, and beseech that ye may be
   filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual
   understanding; that ye may walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing;
   being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of
   God; strengthened with all might according to the glory of His power."
   [3053] And again he says, "According to the disposition of the grace of
   God which is given me, that ye may fulfil the word of God; the mystery
   which has been hid from ages and generations, which now is manifested
   to His saints: to whom God wished to make known what is the riches of
   the glory of this mystery among the nations." [3054] So that, on the
   one hand, then, are the mysteries which were hid till the time of the
   apostles, and were delivered by them as they received from the Lord,
   and, concealed in the Old Testament, were manifested to the saints.
   And, on the other hand, there is "the riches of the glory of the
   mystery in the Gentiles," which is faith and hope in Christ; which in
   another place he has called the "foundation." [3055] And again, as if
   in eagerness to divulge this knowledge, he thus writes: "Warning every
   man in all wisdom, that we may present every man (the whole man)
   perfect in Christ;" not every man simply, since no one would be
   unbelieving. Nor does he call every man who believes in Christ perfect;
   but he [3056] says all the man, as if he said the whole man, as if
   purified in body and soul. For that the knowledge does not appertain to
   all, he expressly adds: "Being knit together in love, and unto all the
   riches of the full assurance of knowledge, to the acknowledgment of the
   mystery of God in Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom
   and of knowledge." [3057] "Continue in prayer, watching therein with
   thanksgiving." [3058] And thanksgiving has place not for the soul and
   spiritual blessings alone, but also for the body, and for the good
   things of the body. And he still more clearly reveals that knowledge
   belongs not to all, by adding: "Praying at the same time for you, that
   God would open to us a door to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I
   am bound; that I may make it known as I ought to speak." [3059] For
   there were certainly, among the Hebrews, some things delivered
   unwritten. "For when ye ought to be teachers for the time," it is said,
   as if they had grown old in the Old Testament, "ye have again need that
   one teach you which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and
   are become such as have need of milk, and not of solid food. For every
   one that partaketh of milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness;
   for he is a babe, being instructed with the first lessons. But solid
   food belongs to those who are of full age, who by reason of use have
   their senses exercised so as to distinguish between good and evil.
   Wherefore, leaving the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, let
   us go on to perfection." [3060]

   Barnabas, too, who in person preached the word along with the apostle
   in the ministry of the Gentiles, says, "I write to you most simply,
   that ye may understand." Then below, exhibiting already a clearer trace
   of gnostic tradition, he says, "What says the other prophet Moses to
   them? Lo, thus saith the Lord God, Enter ye into the good land which
   the Lord God sware, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and ye
   received for an inheritance that land, flowing with milk and honey."
   [3061] What says knowledge? Learn, hope, it says, in Jesus, who is to
   be manifested to you in the flesh. For man is the suffering land; for
   from the face of the ground was the formation of Adam. What, then, does
   it say in reference to the good land, flowing with milk and honey?
   Blessed be our Lord, brethren, who has put into our hearts wisdom, and
   the understanding of His secrets. For the prophet says, "Who shall
   understand the Lord's parable but the wise and understanding, and he
   that loves his Lord?" It is but for few to comprehend these things. For
   it is not in the way of envy that the Lord announced in a Gospel, "My
   mystery is to me, and to the sons of my house;" placing the election in
   safety, and beyond anxiety; so that the things pertaining to what it
   has chosen and taken may be above the reach of envy. For he who has not
   the knowledge of good is wicked: for there is one good, the Father; and
   to be ignorant of the Father is death, as to know Him is eternal life,
   through participation in the power of the incorrupt One. And to be
   incorruptible is to participate in divinity; but revolt from the
   knowledge of God brings corruption. Again the prophet says: "And I will
   give thee treasures, concealed, dark, unseen; that they may know that I
   am the Lord." [3062] Similarly David sings: "For, lo, Thou hast loved
   truth; the obscure and hidden things of wisdom hast Thou showed me."
   [3063] "Day utters speech to day" [3064] (what is clearly written),
   "and night to night proclaims knowledge" (which is hidden in a mystic
   veil); "and there are no words or utterances whose voices shall not be
   heard" by God, who said, "Shall one do what is secret, and I shall not
   see him?"

   Wherefore instruction, which reveals hidden things, is called
   illumination, as it is the teacher only who uncovers the lid of the
   ark, contrary to what the poets say, that "Zeus stops up the jar of
   good things, but opens that of evil." "For I know," says the apostle,
   "that when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing
   of Christ;" [3065] designating the spiritual gift, and the gnostic
   communication, which being present he desires to impart to them present
   as "the fulness of Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery
   sealed in the ages of eternity, but now manifested by the prophetic
   Scriptures, according to the command of the eternal God, made known to
   all the nations, in order to the obedience of faith," that is, those of
   the nations who believe that it is. But only to a few of them is shown
   what those things are which are contained in the mystery.

   Rightly then, Plato, in the Epistles, treating of God, says: "We must
   speak in enigmas; that should the tablet come by any mischance on its
   leaves either by sea or land, he who reads may remain ignorant." For
   the God of the universe, who is above all speech, all conception, all
   thought, can never be committed to writing, being inexpressible even by
   His own power. And this too Plato showed, by saying: "Considering,
   then, these things, take care lest some time or other you repent on
   account of the present things, departing in a manner unworthy. The
   greatest safeguard is not to write, but learn; for it is utterly
   impossible that what is written will not vanish."

   Akin to this is what the holy Apostle Paul says, preserving the
   prophetic and truly ancient secret from which the teachings that were
   good were derived by the Greeks: "Howbeit we speak wisdom among them
   who are perfect; but not the wisdom of this world, or of the princes of
   this world, that come to nought; but we speak the wisdom of God hidden
   in a mystery." [3066] Then proceeding, he thus inculcates the caution
   against the divulging of his words to the multitude in the following
   terms: "And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as
   to carnal, even to babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, not with
   meat: for ye were not yet able; neither are ye now able. For ye are yet
   carnal." [3067]

   If, then, "the milk" is said by the apostle to belong to the babes, and
   "meat" to be the food of the full-grown, milk will be understood to be
   catechetical instruction--the first food, as it were, of the soul. And
   meat is the mystic contemplation; for this is the flesh and the blood
   of the Word, that is, the comprehension of the divine power and
   essence. "Taste and see that the Lord is Christ," [3068] it is said.
   For so He imparts of Himself to those who partake of such food in a
   more spiritual manner; when now the soul nourishes itself, according to
   the truth-loving Plato. For the knowledge of the divine essence is the
   meat and drink of the divine Word. Wherefore also Plato says, in the
   second book of the Republic, "It is those that sacrifice not a sow, but
   some great and difficult sacrifice," who ought to inquire respecting
   God. And the apostle writes, "Christ our passover was sacrificed for
   us;" [3069] --a sacrifice hard to procure, in truth, the Son of God
   consecrated for us.

      Chapter XI.--Abstraction from Material Things Necessary in Order to Attain
      to the True Knowledge of God.

   Now the sacrifice which is acceptable to God is unswerving abstraction
   from the body and its passions. This is the really true piety. And is
   not, on this account, philosophy rightly called by Socrates the
   practice of Death? For he who neither employs his eyes in the exercise
   of thought, nor draws aught from his other senses, but with pure mind
   itself applies to objects, practices the true philosophy. This is,
   then, the import of the silence of five years prescribed by Pythagoras,
   which he enjoined on his disciples; that, abstracting themselves from
   the objects of sense, they might with the mind alone contemplate the
   Deity. It was from Moses that the chief of the Greeks drew these
   philosophical tenets. [3070] For he commands holocausts to be skinned
   and divided into parts. For the gnostic soul must be consecrated to the
   light, stript of the integuments of matter, devoid of the frivolousness
   of the body and of all the passions, which are acquired through vain
   and lying opinions, and divested of the lusts of the flesh. But the
   most of men, clothed with what is perishable, like cockles, and rolled
   all round in a ball in their excesses, like hedgehogs, entertain the
   same ideas of the blessed and incorruptible God as of themselves. But
   it has escaped their notice, though they be near us, that God has
   bestowed on us ten thousand things in which He does not share: birth,
   being Himself unborn; food, He wanting nothing; and growth, He being
   always equal; and long life and immortality, He being immortal and
   incapable of growing old. Wherefore let no one imagine that hands, and
   feet, and mouth, and eyes, and going in and coming out, and resentments
   and threats, are said by the Hebrews to be attributes of God. By no
   means; but that certain of these appellations are used more sacredly in
   an allegorical sense, which, as the discourse proceeds, we shall
   explain at the proper time.

   "Wisdom of all medicines is the Panacea," [3071] writes Callimachus in
   the Epigrams. "And one becomes wise from another, both in past times
   and at present," says Bacchylides in the Poeans; "for it is not very
   easy to find the portals of unutterable words." Beautifully, therefore,
   Isocrates writes in the Panathenaic, having put the question, "Who,
   then, are well trained?" adds, "First, those who manage well the things
   which occur each day, whose opinion jumps with opportunity, and is able
   for the most part to hit on what is beneficial; then those who behave
   becomingly and rightly to those who approach them, who take lightly and
   easily annoyances and molestations offered by others, but conduct
   themselves as far as possible, to those with whom they have
   intercourse, with consummate care and moderation; further, those who
   have the command of their pleasures, and are not too much overcome by
   misfortunes, but conduct themselves in the midst of them with
   manliness, and in a way worthy of the nature which we share;
   fourth--and this is the greatest--those who are not corrupted by
   prosperity, and are not put beside themselves, or made haughty, but
   continue in the class of sensible people." Then he puts on the
   top-stone of the discourse: "Those who have the disposition of their
   soul well suited not to one only of these things, but to them
   all--those I assert to be wise and perfect men, and to possess all the
   virtues."

   Do you see how the Greeks deify the gnostic life (though not knowing
   how to become acquainted with it)? And what knowledge it is, they know
   not even in a dream. If, then, it is agreed among us that knowledge is
   the food of reason, "blessed truly are they," according to the
   Scripture, "who hunger and thirst after truth: for they shall be
   filled" with everlasting food. In the most wonderful harmony with these
   words, Euripides, the philosopher of the drama, is found in the
   following words,--making allusion, I know not how, at once to the
   Father and the Son:--


   "To thee, the Lord of all, I bring

   Cakes and libations too, O Zeus,

   Or Hades would'st thou choose be called;

   Do thou accept my offering of all fruits,

   Rare, full, poured forth."

   For a whole burnt-offering and rare sacrifice for us is Christ. And
   that unwittingly he mentions the Saviour, he will make plain, as he
   adds:--


   "For thou who, 'midst the heavenly gods,

   Jove's sceptre sway'st, dost also share

   The rule of those on earth."

   Then he says expressly:--


   "Send light to human souls that fain would know

   Whence conflicts spring, and what the root of ills,

   And of the blessed gods to whom due rites

   Of sacrifice we needs must pay, that so

   We may from troubles find repose."

   It is not then without reason that in the mysteries that obtain among
   the Greeks, lustrations hold the first place; as also the laver among
   the Barbarians. After these are the minor [3072] mysteries, which have
   some foundation of instruction and of preliminary preparation for what
   is to come after; and the great mysteries, in which nothing remains to
   be learned of the universe, but only to contemplate and comprehend
   nature and things.

   We shall understand the mode of purification by confession, and that of
   contemplation by analysis, advancing by analysis to the first notion,
   beginning with the properties underlying it; abstracting from the body
   its physical properties, taking away the dimension of depth, then that
   of breadth, and then that of length. For the point which remains is a
   unit, so to speak, having position; from which if we abstract position,
   there is the conception of unity.

   If, then, abstracting all that belongs to bodies and things called
   incorporeal, we cast ourselves into the greatness of Christ, and thence
   advance into immensity by holiness, we may reach somehow to the
   conception of the Almighty, knowing not what He is, but what He is not.
   And form and motion, or standing, or a throne, or place, or right hand
   or left, are not at all to be conceived as belonging to the Father of
   the universe, although it is so written. But what each of these means
   will be shown in its proper place. The First Cause is not then in
   space, but above both space, and time, and name, and conception.

   Wherefore also Moses says, "Show Thyself to me," [3073] --intimating
   most clearly that God is not capable of being taught by man, or
   expressed in speech, but to be known only by His own power. For inquiry
   was obscure and dim; but the grace of knowledge is from Him by the Son.
   Most clearly Solomon shall testify to us, speaking thus: "The prudence
   of man is not in me: but God giveth me wisdom, and I know holy things."
   [3074] Now Moses, describing allegorically the divine prudence, called
   it the tree of life planted in Paradise; which Paradise may be the
   world in which all things proceeding from creation grow. In it also the
   Word blossomed and bore fruit, being "made flesh," and gave life to
   those "who had tasted of His graciousness;" since it was not without
   the wood of the tree that He came to our knowledge. For our life was
   hung on it, in order that we might believe. And Solomon again says:
   "She is a tree of immortality to those who take hold of her." [3075]
   "Behold, I set before thy face life and death, to love the Lord thy
   God, and to walk in His ways, and hear His voice, and trust in life.
   But if ye transgress the statutes and the judgments which I have given
   you, ye shall be destroyed with destruction. For this is life, and the
   length of thy days, to love the Lord thy God." [3076]

   Again: "Abraham, when he came to the place which God told him of on the
   third day, looking up, saw the place afar off." [3077] For the first
   day is that which is constituted by the sight of good things; and the
   second is the soul's [3078] best desire; on the third, the mind
   perceives spiritual things, the eyes of the understanding being opened
   by the Teacher who rose on the third day. The three days may be the
   mystery of the seal, [3079] in which God is really believed. It is
   consequently afar off that he sees the place. For the region of God is
   hard to attain; which Plato called the region of ideas, having learned
   from Moses that it was a place which contained all things universally.
   But it is seen by Abraham afar off, rightly, because of his being in
   the realms of generation, and he is forthwith initiated by the angel.
   Thence says the apostle: "Now we see as through a glass, but then face
   to face," by those sole pure and incorporeal applications of the
   intellect. In reasoning, it is possible to divine respecting God, if
   one attempt without any of the senses, by reason, to reach what is
   individual; and do not quit the sphere of existences, till, rising up
   to the things which transcend it, he apprehends by the intellect itself
   that which is good, moving in the very confines of the world of
   thought, according to Plato.

   Again, Moses, not allowing altars and temples to be constructed in many
   places, but raising one temple of God, announced that the world was
   only-begotten, as Basilides says, and that God is one, as does not as
   yet appear to Basilides. And since the gnostic Moses does not
   circumscribe within space Him that cannot be circumscribed, he set up
   no image in the temple to be worshipped; showing that God was
   invisible, and incapable of being circumscribed; and somehow leading
   the Hebrews to the conception of God by the honour for His name in the
   temple. Further, the Word, prohibiting the constructing of temples and
   all sacrifices, intimates that the Almighty is not contained in
   anything, by what He says: "What house will ye build to Me? saith the
   Lord. Heaven is my throne," [3080] and so on. Similarly respecting
   sacrifices: "I do not desire the blood of bulls and the fat of lambs,"
   [3081] and what the Holy Spirit by the prophet in the sequel forbids.

   Most excellently, therefore, Euripides accords with these, when he
   writes:--


   "What house constructed by the workmen's hands,

   With folds of walls, can clothe the shape divine?"

   And of sacrifices he thus speaks:--


   "For God needs nought, if He is truly God.

   These of the minstrels are the wretched myths."

   "For it was not from need that God made the world; that He might reap
   honours from men and the other gods and demons, winning a kind of
   revenue from creation, and from us, fumes, and from the gods and
   demons, their proper ministries," says Plato. Most instructively,
   therefore, says Paul in the Acts of the Apostles: "The God that made
   the world, and all things in it, being the Lord of heaven and earth,
   dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is worshipped by men's
   hands, as if He needed anything; seeing that it is He Himself that
   giveth to all breath, and life, and all things." [3082] And Zeno, the
   founder of the Stoic sect, says in this book of the Republic, "that we
   ought to make neither temples nor images; for that no work is worthy of
   the gods." And he was not afraid to write in these very words: "There
   will be no need to build temples. For a temple is not worth much, and
   ought not to be regarded as holy. For nothing is worth much, and holy,
   which is the work of builders and mechanics." Rightly, therefore, Plato
   too, recognising the world as God's temple, pointed out to the citizens
   a spot in the city where their idols were to be laid up. "Let not,
   then, any one again," he says, "consecrate temples to the gods. For
   gold and silver in other states, in the case of private individuals and
   in the temples, is an invidious possession; and ivory, a body which has
   abandoned the life, is not a sacred votive offering; and steel and
   brass are the instruments of wars; but whatever one wishes to dedicate,
   let it be wood of one tree, as also stone for common temples." Rightly,
   then, in the great Epistle he says: "For it is not capable of
   expression, like other branches of study. But as the result of great
   intimacy with this subject, and living with it, a sudden light, like
   that kindled by a coruscating fire, arising in the soul, feeds itself."
   Are not these statements like those of Zephaniah the prophet? "And the
   Spirit of the Lord took me, and brought me up to the fifth heaven, and
   I beheld angels called Lords; and their diadem was set on in the Holy
   Spirit; and each of them had a throne sevenfold brighter than the light
   of the rising sun; and they dwelt in temples of salvation, and hymned
   the ineffable, Most High God." [3083]

      Chapter XII.--God Cannot Be Embraced in Words or by the Mind.

   "For both is it a difficult task to discover the Father and Maker of
   this universe; and having found Him, it is impossible to declare Him to
   all. For this is by no means capable of expression, like the other
   subjects of instruction," says the truth-loving Plato. For he that had
   heard right well that the all-wise Moses, ascending the mount for holy
   contemplation, to the summit of intellectual objects, necessarily
   commands that the whole people do not accompany him. And when the
   Scripture says, "Moses entered into the thick darkness where God was,"
   this shows to those capable of understanding, that God is invisible and
   beyond expression by words. And "the darkness"--which is, in truth, the
   unbelief and ignorance of the multitude--obstructs the gleam of truth.
   And again Orpheus, the theologian, aided from this quarter, says:--


   "One is perfect in himself, and all things are made the progeny of
   one,"

   or, "are born;" for so also is it written. He adds:--


   "Him

   No one of mortals has seen, but He sees all."

   And he adds more clearly:--


   "Him see I not, for round about, a cloud

   Has settled; for in mortal eyes are small,

   And mortal pupils--only flesh and bones grow there."

   To these statements the apostle will testify: "I know a man in Christ,
   caught up into the third heaven, and thence into Paradise, who heard
   unutterable words which it is not lawful for a man to
   speak,"--intimating thus the impossibility of expressing God, and
   indicating that what is divine is unutterable by human [3084] power;
   if, indeed, he begins to speak above the third heaven, as it is lawful
   to initiate the elect souls in the mysteries there. For I know what is
   in Plato (for the examples from the barbarian philosophy, which are
   many, are suggested now by the composition which, in accordance with
   promises previously given, waits the suitable time). For doubting, in
   Timæus, whether we ought to regard several worlds as to be understood
   by many heavens, or this one, he makes no distinction in the names,
   calling the world and heaven by the same name. But the words of the
   statement are as follows: "Whether, then, have we rightly spoken of one
   heaven, or of many and infinite? It were more correct to say one, if
   indeed it was created according to the model." Further, in the Epistle
   of the Romans to the Corinthians [3085] it is written, "An ocean
   illimitable by men and the worlds after it." Consequently, therefore,
   the noble apostle exclaims, "Oh the depth of the riches both of the
   wisdom and the knowledge of God!" [3086]

   And was it not this which the prophet meant, when he ordered unleavened
   cakes [3087] to be made, intimating that the truly sacred mystic word,
   respecting the unbegotten and His powers, ought to be concealed? In
   confirmation of these things, in the Epistle to the Corinthians the
   apostle plainly says: "Howbeit we speak wisdom among those who are
   perfect, but not the wisdom of this world, or of the princes of this
   world, that come to nought. But we speak the wisdom of God hidden in a
   mystery." [3088] And again in another place he says: "To the
   acknowledgment of the mystery of God in Christ, in whom are hid all the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge." [3089] These things the Saviour
   Himself seals when He says: "To you it is given to know the mysteries
   of the kingdom of heaven." [3090] And again the Gospel says that the
   Saviour spake to the apostles the word in a mystery. For prophecy says
   of Him: "He will open His mouth in parables, and will utter things kept
   secret from the foundation of the world." [3091] And now, by the
   parable of the leaven, the Lord shows concealment; for He says, "The
   kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three
   measures of meal, till the whole was leavened." [3092] For the
   tripartite soul is saved by obedience, through the spiritual power
   hidden in it by faith; or because the power of the word which is given
   to us, being strong [3093] and powerful, draws to itself secretly and
   invisibly every one who receives it, and keeps it within himself, and
   brings his whole system into unity.

   Accordingly Solon has written most wisely respecting God thus:--


   "It is most difficult to apprehend the mind's invisible measure

   Which alone holds the boundaries of all things."

   For "the divine," says the poet of Agrigenturn, [3094] --


   "Is not capable of being approached with our eyes,

   Or grasped with our hands; but the highway

   Of persuasion, highest of all, leads to men's minds."

   And John the apostle says: "No man hath seen God at any time. The
   only-begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared
   Him," [3095] --calling invisibility and ineffableness the bosom of God.
   Hence some have called it the Depth, as containing and embosoming all
   things, inaccessible and boundless.

   This discourse respecting God is most difficult to handle. For since
   the first principle of everything is difficult to find out, the
   absolutely first and oldest principle, which is the cause of all other
   things being and having been, is difficult to exhibit. For how can that
   be expressed which is neither genus, nor difference, nor species, nor
   individual, nor number; nay more, is neither an event, nor that to
   which an event happens? No one can rightly express Him wholly. For on
   account of His greatness He is ranked as the All, and is the Father of
   the universe. Nor are any parts to be predicated of Him. For the One is
   indivisible; wherefore also it is infinite, not considered with
   reference to inscrutability, but with reference to its being without
   dimensions, and not having a limit. And therefore it is without form
   and name. And if we name it, we do not do so properly, terming it
   either the One, or the Good, or Mind, or Absolute Being, or Father, or
   God, or Creator, or Lord. We speak not as supplying His name; but for
   want, we use good names, in order that the mind may have these as
   points of support, so as not to err in other respects. For each one by
   itself does not express God; but all together are indicative of the
   power of the Omnipotent. For predicates are expressed either from what
   belongs to things themselves, or from their mutual relation. But none
   of these are admissible in reference to God. Nor any more is He
   apprehended by the science of demonstration. For it depends on primary
   and better known principles. But there is nothing antecedent to the
   Unbegotten.

   It remains that we understand, then, the Unknown, by divine grace, and
   by the word alone that proceeds from Him; as Luke in the Acts of the
   Apostles relates that Paul said, "Men of Athens, I perceive that in all
   things ye are too superstitious. [3096] For in walking about, and
   beholding the objects of your worship, I found an altar on which was
   inscribed, To the Unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship,
   Him declare I unto you." [3097]

      Chapter XIII.--The Knowledge of God a Divine Gift, According to the
      Philosophers.

   Everything, then, which falls under a name, is originated, whether they
   will or not. Whether, then, the Father Himself draws to Himself
   everyone who has led a pure life, and has reached the conception of the
   blessed and incorruptible nature; or whether the free-will which is in
   us, by reaching the knowledge of the good, leaps and bounds over the
   barriers, as the gymnasts say; yet it is not without eminent grace that
   the soul is winged, and soars, and is raised above the higher spheres,
   laying aside all that is heavy, and surrendering itself to its kindred
   element.

   Plato, too, in Meno, says that virtue is God-given, as the following
   expressions show: "From this argument then, O Meno, virtue is shown to
   come to those, in whom it is found, by divine providence." Does it not
   then appear that "the gnostic disposition" which has come to all is
   enigmatically called "divine providence?" And he adds more explicitly:
   "If, then, in this whole treatise we have investigated well, it results
   that virtue is neither by nature, nor is it taught, but is produced by
   divine providence, not without intelligence, in those in whom it is
   found." Wisdom which is God-given, as being the power of the Father,
   rouses indeed our free-will, and admits faith, and repays the
   application of the elect with its crowning fellowship.

   And now I will adduce Plato himself, who clearly deems it fit to
   believe the children of God. For, discoursing on gods that are visible
   and born, in Timæus, he says: "But to speak of the other demons, and to
   know their birth, is too much for us. But we must credit those who have
   formerly spoken, they being the offspring of the gods, as they said,
   and knowing well their progenitors, although they speak without
   probable and necessary proofs." I do not think it possible that clearer
   testimony could be borne by the Greeks, that our Saviour, and those
   anointed to prophesy (the latter being called the sons of God, and the
   Lord being His own Son), are the true witnesses respecting divine
   things. Wherefore also they ought to be believed, being inspired, he
   added. And were one to say in a more tragic vein, that we ought not to
   believe,


   "For it was not Zeus that told me these things,"

   yet let him know that it was God Himself that promulgated the
   Scriptures by His Son. And he, who announces what is his own, is to be
   believed. "No one," says the Lord, "hath known the Father but the Son,
   and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him." [3098] This, then, is to be
   believed, according to Plato, though it is announced and spoken
   "without probable and necessary proofs," but in the Old and New
   Testament. "For except ye believe," says the Lord, "ye shall die in
   your sins." [3099] And again: "He that believeth hath everlasting
   life." [3100] "Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him."
   [3101] For trusting is more than faith. For when one has believed
   [3102] that the Son of God is our teacher, he trusts [3103] that his
   teaching is true. And as "instruction," according to Empedocles, "makes
   the mind grow," so trust in the Lord makes faith grow.

   We say, then, that it is characteristic of the same persons to vilify
   philosophy, and run down faith, and to praise iniquity and felicitate a
   libidinous life. But now faith, if it is the voluntary assent of the
   soul, is still the doer of good things, the foundation of right
   conduct; and if Aristotle defines strictly when he teaches that poiein
   is applied to the irrational creatures and to inanimate things, while
   prattein is applicable to men only, let him correct those who say that
   God is the maker (poietes) of the universe. And what is done (prakton),
   he says, is as good or as necessary. To do wrong, then, is not good,
   for no one does wrong except for some other thing; and nothing that is
   necessary is voluntary. To do wrong, then, is voluntary, so that it is
   not necessary. But the good differ especially from the bad in
   inclinations and good desires. For all depravity of soul is accompanied
   with want of restraint; and he who acts from passion, acts from want of
   restraint and from depravity.

   I cannot help admiring in every particular that divine utterance:
   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not in by the door
   into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief
   and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of
   the sheep. To him the porter openeth." Then the Lord says in
   explanation, "I am the door of the sheep." [3104] Men must then be
   saved by learning the truth through Christ, even if they attain
   philosophy. For now that is clearly shown "which was not made known to
   other ages, which is now revealed to the sons of men." [3105] For there
   was always a natural manifestation of the one Almighty God, among all
   right-thinking men; and the most, who had not quite divested themselves
   of shame with respect to the truth, apprehended the eternal beneficence
   in divine providence. In fine, then, Xenocrates the Chalcedonian was
   not quite without hope that the notion of the Divinity existed even in
   the irrational creatures. And Democritus, though against his will, will
   make this avowal by the consequences of his dogmas; for he represents
   the same images as issuing, from the divine essence, on men and on the
   irrational animals. [3106] Far from destitute of a divine idea is man,
   who, it is written in Genesis, partook of inspiration, being endowed
   with a purer essence than the other animate creatures. Hence the
   Pythagoreans say that mind comes to man by divine providence, as Plato
   and Aristotle avow; but we assert that the Holy Spirit inspires him who
   has believed. The Platonists hold that mind is an effluence of divine
   dispensation in the soul, and they place the soul in the body. For it
   is expressly said by Joel, one of the twelve prophets, "And it shall
   come to pass after these things, I will pour out of My Spirit on all
   flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy." [3107] But it
   is not as a portion of God that the Spirit is in each of us. But how
   this dispensation takes place, and what the Holy Spirit is, shall be
   shown by us in the books on prophecy, and in those on the soul. But
   "incredulity is good at concealing the depths of knowledge," according
   to Heraclitus; "for incredulity escapes from ignorance."

      Chapter XIV.--Greek Plagiarism from the Hebrews.

   Let us add in completion what follows, and exhibit now with greater
   clearness the plagiarism of the Greeks from the Barbarian philosophy.

   Now the Stoics say that God, like the soul, is essentially body and
   spirit. You will find all this explicitly in their writings. Do not
   consider at present their allegories as the gnostic truth presents
   them; whether they show one thing and mean another, like the dexterous
   athletes. Well, they say that God pervades all being; while we call Him
   solely Maker, and Maker by the Word. They were misled by what is said
   in the book of Wisdom: "He pervades and passes through all by reason of
   His purity;" [3108] since they did not understand that this was said of
   Wisdom, which was the first of the creation of God.

   So be it, they say. But the philosophers, the Stoics, and Plato, and
   Pythagoras, nay more, Aristotle the Peripatetic, suppose the existence
   of matter among the first principles; and not one first principle. Let
   them then know that what is called matter by them, is said by them to
   be without quality, and without form, and more daringly said by Plato
   to be non-existence. And does he not say very mystically, knowing that
   the true and real first cause is one, in these very words: "Now, then,
   let our opinion be so. As to the first principle or principles of the
   universe, or what opinion we ought to entertain about all these points,
   we are not now to speak, for no other cause than on account of its
   being difficult to explain our sentiments in accordance with the
   present form of discourse." But undoubtedly that prophetic expression,
   "Now the earth was invisible and formless," supplied them with the
   ground of material essence.

   And the introduction of "chance" was hence suggested to Epicurus, who
   misapprehended the statement, "Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity."
   And it occurred to Aristotle to extend Providence as far as the moon
   from this psalm: "Lord, Thy mercy is in the heavens; and Thy truth
   reacheth to the clouds." [3109] For the explanation of the prophetic
   mysteries had not yet been revealed previous to the advent of the Lord.

   Punishments after death, on the other hand, and penal retribution by
   fire, were pilfered from the Barbarian philosophy both by all the
   poetic Muses and by the Hellenic philosophy. Plato, accordingly, in the
   last book of the Republic, says in these express terms: "Then these men
   fierce and fiery to look on, standing by, and hearing the sound, seized
   and took some aside; and binding Aridæus and the rest hand, foot, and
   head, and throwing them down, and flaying them, dragged them along the
   way, tearing their flesh with thorns." For the fiery men are meant to
   signify the angels, who seize and punish the wicked. "Who maketh," it
   is said, "His angels spirits; His ministers flaming fire." [3110] It
   follows from this that the soul is immortal. For what is tortured or
   corrected being in a state of sensation lives, though said to suffer.
   Well! Did not Plato know of the rivers of fire and the depth of the
   earth, and Tartarus, called by the Barbarians Gehenna, naming, as he
   does prophetically, [3111] Cocytus, and Acheron, and Pyriphlegethon,
   and introducing such corrective tortures for discipline?

   But indicating "the angels" as the Scripture says, "of the little ones,
   and of the least, which see God," and also the oversight reaching to us
   exercised by the tutelary angels, [3112] he shrinks not from writing,
   "That when all the souls have selected their several lives, according
   as it has fallen to their lot, they advance in order to Lachesis; and
   she sends along with each one, as his guide in life, and the joint
   accomplisher of his purposes, the demon which he has chosen." Perhaps
   also the demon of Socrates suggested to him something similar.

   Nay, the philosophers. having so heard from Moses, taught that the
   world was created. [3113] And so Plato expressly said, "Whether was it
   that the world had no beginning of its existence, or derived its
   beginning from some beginning? For being visible, it is tangible; and
   being tangible, it has a body." Again, when he says, "It is a difficult
   task to find the Maker and Father of this universe," he not only showed
   that the universe was created, but points out that it was generated by
   him as a son, and that he is called its father, as deriving its being
   from him alone, and springing from non-existence. The Stoics, too, hold
   the tenet that the world was created.

   And that the devil so spoken of by the Barbarian philosophy, the prince
   of the demons, is a wicked spirit, Plato asserts in the tenth book of
   the Laws, in these words: "Must we not say that spirit which pervades
   the things that are moved on all sides, pervades also heaven? Well,
   what? One or more? Several, say I, in reply for you. Let us not suppose
   fewer than two--that which is beneficent, and that which is able to
   accomplish the opposite." Similarly in the Phoedrus he writes as
   follows: "Now there are other evils. But some demon has mingled
   pleasure with the most things at present." Further, in the tenth book
   of the Laws, he expressly emits that apostolic sentiment, [3114] "Our
   contest is not with flesh and blood, but principalities, with powers,
   with the spiritual things of those which are in heaven;" writing thus:
   "For since we are agreed that heaven is full of many good beings; but
   it is also full of the opposite of these, and more of these; and as we
   assert such a contest is deathless, and requiring marvellous
   watchfulness."

   Again the Barbarian philosophy knows the world of thought and the world
   of sense--the former archetypal, and the latter the image of that which
   is called the model; and assigns the former to the Monad, as being
   perceived by the mind, and the world of sense to the number six. For
   six is called by the Pythagoreans marriage, as being the genital
   number; and he places in the Monad the invisible heaven and the holy
   earth, and intellectual light. For "in the beginning," it is said, "God
   made the heaven and the earth; and the earth was invisible." And it is
   added, "And God said, Let there be light; and there was light." [3115]
   And in the material cosmogony He creates a solid heaven (and what is
   solid is capable of being perceived by sense), and a visible earth, and
   a light that is seen. Does not Plato hence appear to have left the
   ideas of living creatures in the intellectual world, and to make
   intellectual objects into sensible species according to their genera?
   Rightly then Moses says, that the body which Plato calls "the earthly
   tabernacle" was formed of the ground, but that the rational soul was
   breathed by God into man's face. For there, they say, the ruling
   faculty is situated; interpreting the access by the senses into the
   first man as the addition of the soul.

   Wherefore also man is said "to have been made in [God's] image and
   likeness." For the image of God is the divine and royal Word, the
   impassible man; and the image of the image is the human mind. And if
   you wish to apprehend the likeness by another name, you will find it
   named in Moses, a divine correspondence. For he says, "Walk after the
   Lord your God, and keep His commandments." [3116] And I reckon all the
   virtuous, servants and followers of God. Hence the Stoics say that the
   end of philosophy is to live agreeable to nature; and Plato, likeness
   to God, as we have shown in the second Miscellany. And Zeno the Stoic,
   borrowing from Plato, and he from the Barbarian philosophy, says that
   all the good are friends of one another. For Socrates says in the
   Phoedrus, "that it has not been ordained that the bad should be a
   friend to the bad, nor the good be not a friend to the good;" as also
   he showed sufficiently in the Lysis, that friendship is never preserved
   in wickedness and vice. And the Athenian stranger similarly says, "that
   there is conduct pleasing and conformable to God, based on one ancient
   ground-principle, That like loves like, provided it be within measure.
   But things beyond measure are congenial neither to what is within nor
   what is beyond measure. Now it is the case that God is the measure to
   us of all things." Then proceeding, Plato [3117] adds: "For every good
   man is like every other good man; and so being like to God, he is liked
   by every good man and by God." At this point I have just recollected
   the following. In the end of the Timæus he says: "You must necessarily
   assimilate that which perceives to that which is perceived, according
   to its original nature; and it is by so assimilating it that you attain
   to the end of the highest life proposed by the gods to men, [3118] for
   the present or the future time." For those have equal power with these.
   He, who seeks, will not stop till he find; and having found, he will
   wonder; and wondering, he will reign; and reigning, he will rest. And
   what? Were not also those expressions of Thales derived from these? The
   fact that God is glorified for ever, and that He is expressly called by
   us the Searcher of hearts, he interprets. For Thales being asked, What
   is the divinity? said, What has neither beginning nor end. And on
   another asking, "If a man could elude the knowledge of the Divine Being
   while doing aught?" said, "How could he who cannot do so while
   thinking?"

   Further, the Barbarian philosophy recognises good as alone excellent,
   and virtue as sufficient for happiness, when it says, "Behold, I have
   set before your eyes good and evil, life and death, that ye may choose
   life." [3119] For it calls good, "life," and the choice of it
   excellent, and the choice of the opposite "evil." And the end of good
   and of life is to become a lover of God: "For this is thy life and
   length of days," to love that which tends to the truth. And these
   points are yet clearer. For the Saviour, in enjoining to love God and
   our neighbour, says, "that on these two commandments hang the whole law
   and the prophets." Such are the tenets promulgated by the Stoics; and
   before these, by Socrates, in the Phoedrus, who prays, "O Pan, and ye
   other gods, give me to be beautiful within." And in the Theoetetus he
   says expressly, "For he that speaks well (kalos) is both beautiful and
   good." And in the Protagoras he avers to the companions of Protagoras
   that he has met with one more beautiful than Alcibiades, if indeed that
   which is wisest is most beautiful. For he said that virtue was the
   soul's beauty, and, on the contrary, that vice was the soul's
   deformity. Accordingly, Antipatrus the Stoic, who composed three books
   on the point, "That, according to Plato, only the beautiful is good,"
   shows that, according to him, virtue is sufficient for happiness; and
   adduces several other dogmas agreeing with the Stoics. And by
   Aristobulus, who lived in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, who is
   mentioned by the composer of the epitome of the books of the Maccabees,
   there were abundant books to show that the Peripatetic philosophy was
   derived from the law of Moses and from the other prophets. Let such be
   the case.

   Plato plainly calls us brethren, as being of one God and one teacher,
   in the following words: "For ye who are in the state are entirely
   brethren (as we shall say to them, continuing our story). But the God
   who formed you, mixed gold in the composition of those of you who are
   fit to rule, at your birth, wherefore you are most highly honoured; and
   silver in the case of those who are helpers; and steel and brass in the
   case of farmers and other workers." Whence, of necessity, some embrace
   and love those things to which knowledge pertains; and others matters
   of opinion. Perchance he prophesies of that elect nature which is bent
   on knowledge; if by the supposition he makes of three natures he does
   not describe three politics, as some supposed: that of the Jews, the
   silver; that of the Greeks, the third; and that of the Christians, with
   whom has been mingled the regal gold, the Holy Spirit, the golden.
   [3120]

   And exhibiting the Christian life, he writes in the Theætetus in these
   words: "Let us now speak of the highest principles. For why should we
   speak of those who make an abuse of philosophy? These know neither the
   way to the forum, nor know they the court or the senate-house, or any
   other public assembly of the state. As for laws and decrees spoken or
   [3121] written, they neither see nor hear them. But party feelings of
   political associations and public meetings, and revels with musicians
   [occupy them]; but they never even dream of taking part in affairs. Has
   any one conducted himself either well or ill in the state, or has aught
   evil descended to a man from his forefathers?--it escapes their
   attention as much as do the sands of the sea. And the man does not even
   know that he does not know all these things; but in reality his body
   alone is situated and dwells in the state, [3122] while the man himself
   flies, according to Pindar, beneath the earth and above the sky,
   astronomizing, and exploring all nature on all sides.

   Again, with the Lord's saying, "Let your yea be yea, and your nay nay,"
   may be compared the following: "But to admit a falsehood, and destroy a
   truth, is in nowise lawful." With the prohibition, also, against
   swearing agrees the saying in the tenth book of the Laws: "Let praise
   and an oath in everything be absent."

   And in general, Pythagoras, and Socrates, and Plato say that they hear
   God's voice while closely contemplating the fabric of the universe,
   made and preserved unceasingly by God. For they heard Moses say, "He
   said, and it was done," describing the word of God as an act.

   And founding on the formation of man from the dust, the philosophers
   constantly term the body earthy. Homer, too, does not hesitate to put
   the following as an imprecation:--


   "But may you all become earth and water."

   As Esaias says, "And trample them down as clay." And Callimachus
   clearly writes:--


   "That was the year in which

   Birds, fishes, quadrupeds,

   Spoke like Prometheus' clay."

   And the same again:--


   "If thee Prometheus formed,

   And thou art not of other clay."

   Hesiod says of Pandora:--


   "And bade Hephæstus, famed, with all his speed,

   Knead earth with water, and man's voice and mind

   Infuse."

   The Stoics, accordingly, define nature to be artificial fire, advancing
   systematically to generation. And God and His Word are by Scripture
   figuratively termed fire and light. But how? Does not Homer himself, is
   not Homer himself, paraphrasing the retreat of the water from the land,
   and the clear uncovering of the dry land, when he says of Tethys and
   Oceanus:--


   "For now for a long time they abstain from

   Each other's bed and love?" [3123]

   Again, power in all things is by the most intellectual among the Greeks
   ascribed to God; Epicharmus--he was a Pythagorean--saying:--


   "Nothing escapes the divine. This it behoves thee to know.

   He is our observer. To God nought is impossible."

   And the lyric poet:--


   "And God from gloomy night

   Can raise unstained light,

   And can in darksome gloom obscure

   The day's refulgence pure."

   He alone who is able to make night during the period of day is God.

   In the Phoenomena Aratus writes thus:--


   "With Zeus let us begin; whom let us ne'er,

   Being men, leave unexpressed. All full of Zeus,

   The streets, and throngs of men, and full the sea,

   And shores, and everywhere we Zeus enjoy."

   He adds:--


   "For we also are

   His offspring;  .  .  .  . "

   that is, by creation.


   "Who, bland to men,

   Propitious signs displays, and to their tasks

   Arouses. For these signs in heaven He fixed,

   The constellations spread, and crowned the year

   With stars; to show to men the seasons' tasks,

   That all things may proceed in order sure.

   Him ever first, Him last too, they adore:

   Hail Father, marvel great--great boon to men."

   And before him, Homer, framing the world in accordance with Moses on
   the Vulcan-wrought shield, says:--


   "On it he fashioned earth, and sky, and sea,

   And all the signs with which the heaven is crowned." [3124]

   For the Zeus celebrated in poems and prose compositions leads the mind
   up to God. And already, so to speak, Democritus writes, "that a few men
   are in the light, who stretch out their hands to that place which we
   Greeks now call the air. Zeus speaks all, and he hears all, and
   distributes and takes away, and he is king of all." And more mystically
   the Boeotian Pindar, being a Pythagorean, says:--


   "One is the race of gods and men,

   And of one mother both have breath;"

   that is, of matter: and names the one creator of these things, whom he
   calls Father, chief artificer, who furnishes the means of advancement
   on to divinity, according to merit.

   For I pass over Plato; he plainly, in the Epistle to Erastus and
   Coriscus, is seen to exhibit the Father and Son somehow or other from
   the Hebrew Scriptures, exhorting in these words: "In invoking by oath,
   with not illiterate gravity, and with culture, the sister of gravity,
   God the author of all, and invoking Him by oath as the Lord, the Father
   of the Leader, and author; whom if ye study with a truly philosophical
   spirit, ye shall know." And the address in the Timoeus calls the
   creator, Father, speaking thus: "Ye gods of gods, of whom I am Father;
   and the Creator of your works." So that when he says, "Around the king
   of all, all things are, and because of Him are all things; and he [or
   that] is the cause of all good things; and around the second are the
   things second in order; and around the third, the third," I understand
   nothing else than the Holy Trinity to be meant; for the third is the
   Holy Spirit, and the Son is the second, by whom all things were made
   according to the will of the Father. [3125]

   And the same, in the tenth book of the Republic, mentions Eros the son
   of Armenius, who is Zoroaster. Zoroaster, then, writes: "These were
   composed by Zoroaster, the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth:
   having died in battle, and been in Hades, I learned them of the gods."
   This Zoroaster, Plato says, having been placed on the funeral pyre,
   rose again to life in twelve days. He alludes perchance to the
   resurrection, or perchance to the fact that the path for souls to
   ascension lies through the twelve signs of the zodiac; and he himself
   says, that the descending pathway to birth is the same. In the same way
   we are to understand the twelve labours of Hercules, after which the
   soul obtains release from this entire world.

   I do not pass over Empedocles, who speaks thus physically of the
   renewal of all things, as consisting in a transmutation into the
   essence of fire, which is to take place. And most plainly of the same
   opinion is Heraclitus of Ephesus, who considered that there was a world
   everlasting, and recognised one perishable--that is, in its
   arrangement, not being different from the former, viewed in a certain
   aspect. But that he knew the imperishable world which consists of the
   universal essence to be everlastingly of a certain nature, he makes
   clear by speaking thus: "The same world of all things, neither any of
   the gods, nor any one of men, made. But there was, and is, and will be
   ever-living fire, kindled according to measure, [3126] and quenched
   according to measure." And that he taught it to be generated and
   perishable, is shown by what follows: "There are transmutations of
   fire,--first, the sea; and of the sea the half is land, the half fiery
   vapour." For he says that these are the effects of power. For fire is
   by the Word of God, which governs all things, changed by the air into
   moisture, which is, as it were, the germ of cosmical change; and this
   he calls sea. And out of it again is produced earth, and sky, and all
   that they contain. How, again, they are restored and ignited, he shows
   clearly in these words: "The sea is diffused and measured according to
   the same rule which subsisted before it became earth." Similarly also
   respecting the other elements, the same is to be understood. The most
   renowned of the Stoics teach similar doctrines with him, in treating of
   the conflagration and the government of the world, and both the world
   and man properly so called, and of the continuance of our souls.

   Plato, again, in the seventh book of the Republic, has called "the day
   here nocturnal," as I suppose, on account of "the world-rulers of this
   darkness;" [3127] and the descent of the soul into the body, sleep and
   death, similarly with Heraclitus. And was not this announced,
   oracularly, of the Saviour, by the Spirit, saying by David, "I slept,
   and slumbered; I awoke: for the Lord will sustain me;" [3128] For He
   not only figuratively calls the resurrection of Christ rising from
   sleep; but to the descent of the Lord into the flesh he also applies
   the figurative term sleep. The Saviour Himself enjoins, "Watch;" [3129]
   as much as to say, "Study how to live, and endeavour to separate the
   soul from the body."

   And the Lord's day Plato prophetically speaks of in the tenth book of
   the Republic, in these words: "And when seven days have passed to each
   of them in the meadow, on the eighth they are to set out and arrive in
   four days." [3130] By the meadow is to be understood the fixed sphere,
   as being a mild and genial spot, and the locality of the pious; and by
   the seven days each motion of the seven planets, and the whole
   practical art which speeds to the end of rest. But after the wandering
   orbs the journey leads to heaven, that is, to the eighth motion and
   day. And he says that souls are gone on the fourth day, pointing out
   the passage through the four elements. But the seventh day is
   recognised as sacred, not by the Hebrews only, but also by the Greeks;
   according to which the whole world of all animals and plants revolve.
   Hesiod says of it:--


   "The first, and fourth, and seventh day were held sacred."

   And again:--


   "And on the seventh the sun's resplendent orb."

   And Homer:--


   "And on the seventh then came the sacred day."

   And:--


   "The seventh was sacred."

   And again:--


   "It was the seventh day, and all things were accomplished."

   And again:--


   "And on the seventh morn we leave the stream of Acheron."

   Callimachus the poet also writes:--


   "It was the seventh morn, and they had all things done."

   And again:--


   "Among good days is the seventh day, and the seventh race."

   And:--


   "The seventh is among the prime, and the seventh is perfect."

   And:--


   "Now all the seven were made in starry heaven,

   In circles shining as the years appear."

   The Elegies of Solon, too, intensely deify the seventh day.

   And how? Is it not similar to Scripture when it says, "Let us remove
   the righteous man from us, because he is troublesome to us?" [3131]
   when Plato, all but predicting the economy of salvation, says in the
   second book of the Republic as follows: "Thus he who is constituted
   just shall be scourged, shall be stretched on the rack, shall be bound,
   have his eyes put out; and at last, having suffered all evils, shall be
   crucified." [3132]

   And the Socratic Antisthenes, paraphrasing that prophetic utterance,
   "To whom have ye likened me? saith the Lord," [3133] says that "God is
   like no one; wherefore no one can come to the knowledge of Him from an
   image."

   Xenophon too, the Athenian, utters these similar sentiments in the
   following words: "He who shakes all things, and is Himself immoveable,
   is manifestly one great and powerful. But what He is in form, appears
   not. No more does the sun, who wishes to shine in all directions, deem
   it right to permit any one to look on himself. But if one gaze on him
   audaciously, he loses his eyesight."


   "What flesh can see with eyes the Heavenly, True,

   Immortal God, whose dwelling is the poles?

   Not even before the bright beams of the sun

   Are men, as being mortal, fit to stand,"--

   the Sibyl had said before. Rightly, then, Xenophanes of Colophon,
   teaching that God is one and incorporeal, adds:--


   "One God there is 'midst gods and men supreme;

   In form, in mind, unlike to mortal men."

   And again:--


   "But men have the idea that gods are born,

   And wear their clothes, and have both voice and shape."

   And again:--


   "But had the oxen or the lions hands,

   Or could with hands depict a work like men,

   Were beasts to draw the semblance of the gods,

   The horses would them like to horses sketch,

   To oxen, oxen, and their bodies make

   Of such a shape as to themselves belongs."

   Let us hear, then, the lyric poet Bacchylides speaking of the divine:--


   "Who to diseases dire [3134] never succumb,

   And blameless are; in nought resembling men."

   And also Cleanthes, the Stoic, who writes thus in a poem on the Deity:
   [3135] --


   "If you ask what is the nature of the good, listen--

   That which is regular, just, holy, pious,

   Self-governing, useful, fair, fitting,

   Grave, independent, always beneficial,

   That feels no fear or grief, profitable, painless,

   Helpful, pleasant, safe, friendly,

   Held in esteem, agreeing with itself: honourable,

   Humble, careful, meek, zealous,

   Perennial, blameless, ever-during."

   And the same, tacitly vilifying the idolatry of the multitude, adds:--


   "Base is every one who looks to opinion,

   With the view of deriving any good from it."

   We are not, then, to think of God according to the opinion of the
   multitude.


   "For I do not think that secretly,

   Imitating the guise of a scoundrel,

   He would go to thy bed as a man,"

   says Amphion to Antiope. And Sophocles plainly writes:--


   "His mother Zeus espoused,

   Not in the likeness of gold, nor covered

   With swan's plumage, as the Pleuronian girl

   He impregnated; but an out and out man."

   He further proceeds, and adds:--


   "And quick the adulterer stood on the bridal steps."

   Then he details still more plainly the licentiousness of the fabled
   Zeus:--


   "But he nor food nor cleansing water touched,

   But heart-stung went to bed, and that whole night

   Wantoned."

   But let these be resigned to the follies of the theatre.

   Heraclius plainly says: "But of the word which is eternal men are not
   able to understand, both before they have heard it, and on first
   hearing it." And the lyrist Melanippides says in song:--


   "Hear me, O Father, Wonder of men,

   Ruler of the ever-living soul."

   And Parmenides the great, as Plato says in the Sophist, writes of God
   thus:--


   "Very much, since unborn and indestructible He is,

   Whole, only-begotten, and immoveable, and unoriginated."

   Hesiod also says:--


   "For He of the immortals all is King and Lord.

   With God [3136] none else in might may strive."

   Nay more, Tragedy, drawing away from idols, teaches to look up to
   heaven. Sophocles, as Hecatæus, who composed the histories in the work
   about Abraham and the Egyptians, says, exclaims plainly on the stage:--


   "One in very truth, God is One,

   Who made the heaven and the far-stretching earth,

   The Deep's blue billow, and the might of winds.

   But of us mortals, many erring far

   In heart, as solace for our woes, have raised

   Images of gods--of stone, or else of brass,

   Or figures wrought of gold or ivory;

   And sacrifices and vain festivals

   To these appointing, deem ourselves devout."

   And Euripides on the stage, in tragedy, says:--


   "Dost thou this lofty, boundless Ether see,

   Which holds the earth around in the embrace

   Of humid arms? This reckon Zeus,

   And this regard as God."

   And in the drama of Pirithous, the same writes those lines in tragic
   vein:--


   "Thee, self-sprung, who on Ether's wheel

   Hast universal nature spun,

   Around whom Light and dusky spangled Night,

   The countless host of stars, too, ceaseless dance."

   For there he says that the creative mind is self-sprung. What follows
   applies to the universe, in which are the opposites of light and
   darkness.

   Æschylus also, the son of Euphorion, says with very great solemnity of
   God:--


   "Ether is Zeus, Zeus earth, and Zeus the heaven;

   The universe is Zeus, and all above."

   I am aware that Plato assents to Heraclitus, who writes: "The one thing
   that is wise alone will not be expressed, and means the name of Zeus."
   And again, "Law is to obey the will of one." And if you wish to adduce
   that saying, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear," you will find
   it expressed by the Ephesian [3137] to the following effect: "Those
   that hear without understanding are like the deaf. The proverb
   witnesses against them, that when present they are absent."

   But do you want to hear from the Greeks expressly of one first
   principle? Timæus the Locrian, in the work on Nature, shall testify in
   the following words: "There is one first principle of all things
   unoriginated. For were it originated, it would be no longer the first
   principle; but the first principle would be that from which it
   originated." For this true opinion was derived from what follows:
   "Hear," it is said, "O Israel; the Lord thy God is one, and Him only
   shalt thou serve." [3138]


   "Lo [3139] He all sure and all unerring is,"

   says the Sibyl.

   Homer also manifestly mentions the Father and the Son by a happy hit of
   divination in the following words:--


   "If Outis, [3140] alone as thou art, offers thee violence,

   And there is no escaping disease sent by Zeus,--

   For the Cyclopes heed not Ægis-bearing Zeus." [3141]

   And before him Orpheus said, speaking of the point in hand:--


   "Son of great Zeus, Father of Ægis-bearing Zeus."

   And Xenocrates the Chalcedonian, who mentions the supreme Zeus and the
   inferior Zeus, leaves an indication of the Father and the Son. Homer,
   while representing the gods as subject to human passions, appears to
   know the Divine Being, whom Epicurus does not so revere. He says
   accordingly:--


   "Why, son of Peleus, mortal as thou art,

   With swift feet me pursuest, a god

   Immortal? Hast thou not yet known

   That I am a god?" [3142]

   For he shows that the Divinity cannot be captured by a mortal, or
   apprehended either with feet, or hands, or eyes, or by the body at all.
   "To whom have ye likened the Lord? or to what likeness have ye likened
   Him?" says the Scripture. [3143] Has not the artificer made the image?
   or the goldsmith, melting the gold, has gilded it, and what follows.

   The comic poet Epicharmus speaks in the Republic clearly of the Word in
   the following terms:--


   "The life of men needs calculation and number alone,

   And we live by number and calculation, for these save mortals." [3144]

   He then adds expressly:--


   "Reason governs mortals, and alone preserves manners."

   Then:--


   "There is in man reasoning; and there is a divine Reason. [3145]

   Reason is implanted in man to provide for life and sustenance,

   But divine Reason attends the arts in the case of all,

   Teaching them always what it is advantageous to do.

   For it was not man that discovered art, but God brought it;

   And the Reason of man derives its origin from the divine Reason."

   The Spirit also cries by Isaiah: "Wherefore the multitude of
   sacrifices? saith the Lord. I am full of holocausts of rams, and the
   fat of lambs and the blood of bulls I wish not;" and a little after
   adds: "Wash you, and be clean. Put away wickedness from your souls,"
   [3146] and so forth.

   Menander, the comic poet, writes in these very words:--


   "If one by offering sacrifice, a crowd

   Of bulls or kids, O Pamphilus, by Zeus.

   Or such like things; by making works of art,

   Garments of gold or purple, images

   Of ivory or emerald, deems by these

   God can be made propitious, he does err,

   And has an empty mind. For the man must prove

   A man of worth, who neither maids deflowers,

   Nor an adulterer is, nor steals, nor kills

   For love of worldly wealth, O Pamphilus.

   Nay, covet not a needle's thread. For God

   Thee sees, being near beside thee." . . . [3147]

   "I am a God at hand," it is said by Jeremiah, [3148] "and not a God
   afar off. Shall a man do aught in secret places, and I shall not see
   him?"

   And again Menander, paraphrasing that Scripture, "Sacrifice a sacrifice
   of righteousness, and trust in the Lord," [3149] thus writes:--


   "And not a needle even that is

   Another's ever covet, dearest friend;

   For God in righteous works delights, and so

   Permits him to increase his worldly wealth,

   Who toils, and ploughs the land both night and day.

   But sacrifice to God, and righteous be,

   Shining not in bright robes, but in thy heart;

   And when thou hear'st the thunder, do not flee,

   Being conscious to thyself of nought amiss,

   Good sir, for thee God ever present sees." [3150]

   "Whilst thou art yet speaking," says the Scripture, "I will say, Lo,
   here I am." [3151]

   Again Diphilus, the comic poet, discourses as, follows on the
   judgment:--


   "Think'st thou, O Niceratus, that the dead,

   Who in all kinds of luxury in life have shared,

   Escape the Deity, as if forgot?

   There is an eye of justice, which sees all.

   For two ways, as we deem, to Hades lead--

   One for the good, the other for the bad.

   But if the earth hides both for ever, then

   Go plunder, steal, rob, and be turbulent.

   But err not. For in Hades judgment is,

   Which God the Lord of all will execute,

   Whose name too dreadful is for me to name,

   Who gives to sinners length of earthly life.

   If any mortal thinks, that day by day,

   While doing ill, he eludes the gods' keen sight,

   His thoughts are evil; and when justice has

   The leisure, he shall then detected be

   So thinking. Look, whoe'er you be that say

   That there is not a God. There is, there is.

   If one, by nature evil, evil does,

   Let him redeem the time; for such as he

   Shall by and by due punishment receive." [3152]

   And with this agrees the tragedy [3153] in the following lines:--


   "For there shall come, shall come [3154] that point of time,

   When Ether, golden-eyed, shall ope its store

   Of treasured fire; and the devouring flame,

   Raging, shall burn all things on earth below,

   And all above." ...

   And after a little he adds:--


   "And when the whole world fades,

   And vanished all the abyss of ocean's waves,

   And earth of trees is bare; and wrapt in flames,

   The air no more begets the winged tribes;

   Then He who all destroyed, shall all restore."

   We shall find expressions similar to these also in the Orphic hymns,
   written as follows:--


   "For having hidden all, brought them again

   To gladsome light, forth from his sacred heart,

   Solicitous."

   And if we live throughout holily and righteously, we are happy here,
   and shall be happier after our departure hence; not possessing
   happiness for a time, but enabled to rest in eternity.


   "At the same hearth and table as the rest

   Of the immortal gods, we sit all free

   Of human ills, unharmed,"

   says the philosophic poetry of Empedocles. And so, according to the
   Greeks, none is so great as to be above judgment, none so insignificant
   as to escape its notice.

   And the same Orpheus speaks thus:--


   "But to the word divine, looking, attend,

   Keeping aright the heart's receptacle

   Of intellect, and tread the straight path well,

   And only to the world's immortal King

   Direct thy gaze." [3155]

   And again, respecting God, saying that He was invisible, and that He
   was known to but one, a Chaldean by race--meaning either by this
   Abraham or his son--he speaks as follows:--


   "But one a scion of Chaldean race;

   For he the sun's path knew right well,

   And how the motion of the sphere about

   The earth proceeds, in circle moving

   Equally around its axis, how the winds

   Their chariot guide o'er air and sea."

   Then, as if paraphrasing the expression, "Heaven is my throne, and
   earth is my footstool," [3156] he adds:--


   "But in great heaven, He is seated firm

   Upon a throne of gold, and 'neath His feet

   The earth. His right hand round the ocean's bound

   He stretches; and the hills' foundations shake

   To the centre at His wrath, nor can endure

   His mighty strength. He all celestial is,

   And all things finishes upon the earth.

   He the Beginning, Middle is, and End.

   But Thee I dare not speak. In limbs

   And mind I tremble. He rules from on high."

   And so forth. For in these he indicates these prophetic utterances: "If
   Thou openest the heaven, trembling shall seize the mountains from Thy
   presence; and they shall melt, as wax melteth before the fire;" [3157]
   and in Isaiah, "Who hath measured the heaven with a span, and the whole
   earth with His fist? [3158] Again, when it is said:--


   "Ruler of Ether, Hades, Sea, and Land,

   Who with Thy bolts Olympus' strong-built home

   Dost shake. Whom demons dread, and whom the throng

   Of gods do fear. Whom, too, the Fates obey,

   Relentless though they be. O deathless One,

   Our mother's Sire! whose wrath makes all things reel;

   Who mov'st the winds, and shroud'st in clouds the world,

   Broad Ether cleaving with Thy lightning gleams,--

   Thine is the order 'mongst the stars, which run

   As Thine unchangeable behests direct.

   Before Thy burning throne the angels wait,

   Much-working, charged to do all things, for men.

   Thy young Spring shines, all prank'd with purple flowers;

   Thy Winter with its chilling clouds assails;

   Thine Autumn noisy Bacchus distributes."

   Then he adds, naming expressly the Almighty God:--


   "Deathless Immortal, capable of being

   To the immortals only uttered! Come,

   Greatest of gods, with strong Necessity.

   Dread, invincible, great, deathless One,

   Whom Ether crowns." ...

   By the expression "Sire of our Mother" (metropator) he not only
   intimates creation out of nothing, but gives occasion to those who
   introduce emissions of imagining a consort of the Deity. And he
   paraphrases those prophetic Scripture--that in Isaiah, "I am He that
   fixes the thunder, and creates the wind; whose hands have founded the
   host of heaven;" [3159] and that in Moses, "Behold, behold that I am
   He, and there is no god beside me: I will kill, and I will make to
   live; I will smite, and I will heal: and there is none that shall
   deliver out of my hands." [3160]


   "And He, from good, to mortals planteth ill,

   And cruel war, and tearful woes,"

   according to Orpheus.

   Such also are the words of the Parian Archilochus.


   "O Zeus, thine is the power of heaven, and thou

   Inflict'st on men things violent and wrong." [3161]

   Again let the Thracian Orpheus sing to us:--


   "His right hand all around to ocean's bound

   He stretches; and beneath His feet is earth."

   These are plainly derived from the following: "The Lord will save the
   inhabited cities, and grasp the whole land in His hand like a nest;"
   [3162] "It is the Lord that made the earth by His power," as saith
   Jeremiah, "and set up the earth by His wisdom." [3163] Further, in
   addition to these, Phocylides, who calls the angels demons, explains in
   the following words that some of them are good, and others bad (for we
   also have learned that some are apostate):--


   "Demons there are--some here, some there--set over men;

   Some, on man's entrance [into life], to ward off ill."

   Rightly, then, also Philemon, the comic poet demolishes idolatry in
   these words:--


   "Fortune is no divinity to us:

   There's no such god. But what befalls by chance

   And of itself to each, is Fortune called."

   And Sophocles the tragedian says:--


   "Not even the gods have all things as they choose,

   Excepting Zeus; for he beginning is and end."

   And Orpheus:--


   "One Might, the great, the flaming heaven, was

   One Deity. All things one Being were; in whom

   All these revolve fire, water, and the earth."

   And so forth.

   Pindar, the lyric poet, as if in Bacchic frenzy, plainly says:--


   "What is God? The All."

   And again:--


   "God, who makes all mortals."

   And when he says,--


   "How little, being a man, dost thou expect

   Wisdom for man? 'Tis hard for mortal mind

   The counsels of the gods to scan; and thou

   Wast of a mortal mother born,"

   he drew the thought from the following: "Who hath known the mind of the
   Lord, or who was His counsellor?" [3164] Hesiod, too, agrees with what
   is said above, in what he writes:--


   "No prophet, sprung of men that dwell on earth,

   Can know the mind of Ægis-bearing Zeus."

   Similarly, then, Solon the Athenian, in the Elegies, following Hesiod,
   writes:--


   "The immortal's mind to men is quite unknown."

   Again Moses, having prophesied that the woman would bring forth in
   trouble and pain, on account of transgression, a poet not
   undistinguished writes:--


   "Never by day

   From toil and woe shall they have rest, nor yet

   By night from groans. Sad cares the gods to men

   Shall give."

   Further, when Homer says,--


   "The Sire himself the golden balance held," [3165]

   he intimates that God is just.

   And Menander, the comic poet, in exhibiting God, says:--


   "To each man, on his birth, there is assigned

   A tutelary Demon, as his life's good guide.

   For that the Demon evil is, and harms

   A good life, is not to be thought."

   Then he adds:--


   "Hapanta d' hagathon heinai ton Theon,"

   meaning either "that every one good is God," or, what is preferable,
   "that God in all things is good."

   Again, Æschylus the tragedian, setting forth the power of God, does not
   shrink from calling Him the Highest, in these words:--


   "Place God apart from mortals; and think not

   That He is, like thyself, corporeal.

   Thou know'st Him not. Now He appears as fire,

   Dread force; as water now; and now as gloom;

   And in the beasts is dimly shadowed forth,

   In wind, and cloud, in lightning, thunder, rain;

   And minister to Him the seas and rocks,

   Each fountain and the water's floods and streams.

   The mountains tremble, and the earth, the vast

   Abyss of sea, and towering height of hills,

   When on them looks the Sovereign's awful eye:

   Almighty is the glory of the Most High God." [3166]

   Does he not seem to you to paraphrase that text, "At the presence of
   the Lord the earth trembles?" [3167] In addition to these, the most
   prophetic Apollo is compelled--thus testifying to the glory of God--to
   say of Athene, when the Medes made war against Greece, that she
   besought and supplicated Zeus for Attica. The oracle is as follows:--


   "Pallas cannot Olympian Zeus propitiate,

   Although with many words and sage advice she prays;

   But he will give to the devouring fire many temples of the immortals,

   Who now stand shaking with terror, and bathed in sweat;" [3168]

   and so forth.

   Thearidas, in his book On Nature, writes: "There was then one really
   true beginning [first principle] of all that exist"--one. For that
   Being in the beginning is one and alone."


   "Nor is there any other except the Great King,"

   says Orpheus. In accordance with whom, the comic poet Diphilus says
   very sententiously, [3169] the


   "Father of all,

   To Him alone incessant reverence pay,

   The inventor and the author of such blessings."

   Rightly therefore Plato "accustoms the best natures to attain to that
   study which formerly we said was the highest, both to see the good and
   to accomplish that ascent. And this, as appears, is not the throwing of
   the potsherds; [3170] but the turning round of the soul from a
   nocturnal day to that which is a true return to that which really is,
   which we shall assert to be the true philosophy." Such as are partakers
   of this he judges [3171] to belong to the golden race, when he says:
   "Ye are all brethren; and those who are of the golden race are most
   capable of judging most accurately in every respect." [3172]

   The Father, then, and Maker of all things is apprehended by all things,
   agreeably to all, by innate power and without teaching,--things
   inanimate, sympathizing with the animate creation; and of living beings
   some are already immoral, working in the light of day. But of those
   that are still mortal, some are in fear, and carried still in their
   mother's womb; and others regulate themselves by their own independent
   reason. And of men all are Greeks and Barbarians. But no race anywhere
   of tillers of the soil, or nomads, and not even of dwellers in cities,
   can live, without being imbued with the faith of a superior being.
   [3173] Wherefore every eastern nation, and every nation touching the
   western shore; or the north, and each one towards the south, [3174]
   --all have one and the same preconception respecting Him who hath
   appointed government; since the most universal of His operations
   equally pervade all. Much more did the philosophers among the Greeks,
   devoted to investigation, starting from the Barbarian philosophy,
   attribute providence [3175] to the "Invisible, and sole, and most
   powerful, and most skilful and supreme cause of all things most
   beautiful;"--not knowing the inferences from these truths, unless
   instructed by us, and not even how God is to be known naturally; but
   only, as we have already often said, by a true periphrasis. [3176]
   Rightly therefore the apostle says, "Is He the God of the Jews only,
   and not also of the Greeks?"--not only saying prophetically that of the
   Greeks believing Greeks would know God; [3177] but also intimating that
   in power the Lord is the God of all, and truly Universal King. For they
   know neither what He is, nor how He is Lord, and Father, and Maker, nor
   the rest of the system of the truth, without being taught by it. Thus
   also the prophetic utterances have the same force as the apostolic
   word. For Isaiah says, "If ye say, We trust in the Lord our God: now
   make an alliance with my Lord the king of the Assyrians." And he adds:
   "And now, was it without the Lord that we came up to this land to make
   war against it?" [3178] And Jonah, himself a prophet, intimates the
   same thing in what he says: "And the shipmaster came to him, and said
   to him, Why dost thou snore? Rise, call on thy God, that He may save
   us, and that we may not perish." [3179] For the expression "thy God" he
   makes as if to one who knew Him by way of knowledge; and the
   expression, "that God may save us," revealed the consciousness in the
   minds of heathens who had applied their mind to the Ruler of all, but
   had not yet believed. And again the same: "And he said to them, I am
   the servant of the Lord; and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven." And
   again the same: "And he said, Let us by no means perish for the life of
   this man." And Malachi the prophet plainly exhibits God saying, "I will
   not accept sacrifice at your hands. For from the rising of the sun to
   its going down, My name is glorified among the Gentiles; and in every
   place sacrifice is offered to Me." [3180] And again: "Because I am a
   great King, saith the Lord omnipotent; and My name is manifest among
   the nations." What name? The Son declaring the Father among the Greeks
   who have believed.

   Plato in what follows gives an exhibition of free-will: "Virtue owns
   not a master; and in proportion as each one honours or dishonours it,
   in that proportion he will be a partaker of it. The blame lies in the
   exercise of free choice." But God is blameless. For He is never the
   author of evil.

   "O warlike Trojans," says the lyric poet, [3181] --


   "High ruling Zeus, who beholds all things,

   Is not the cause of great woes to mortals;

   But it is in the power of all men to find

   Justice, holy, pure,

   Companion of order,

   And of wise Themis

   The sons of the blessed are ye

   In finding her as your associate."

   And Pindar expressly introduces also Zeus Soter, the consort of Themis,
   proclaiming him King, Saviour, Just, in the following lines:--


   "First, prudent Themis, of celestial birth,

   On golden steeds, by Ocean's rock,

   The Fates brought to the stair sublime,

   The shining entrance of Olympus,

   Of Saviour Zeus for aye [3182] to be the spouse,

   And she, the Hours, gold-diademed, fair-fruited, good, brought forth."
   [3183]

   He, then, who is not obedient to the truth, and is puffed up with human
   teaching, is wretched and miserable, according to Euripides:--


   "Who these things seeing, yet apprehends not God,

   But mouthing lofty themes, casts far

   Perverse deceits; stubborn in which, the tongue

   Its shafts discharges, about things unseen,

   Devoid of sense."

   Let him who wishes, then, approaching to the true instruction, learn
   from Parmenides the Eleatic, who promises:--


   "Ethereal nature, then, and all the signs

   In Ether thou shall know, and the effects,

   All viewless, of the sacred Sun's clear torch

   And whence produced. The round-eyed Moon's

   Revolving influences and nature thou

   Shall learn; and the ensphering heaven shall know;

   Whence sprung; and how Necessity took it

   And chained so as to keep the starry bounds."

   And Metrodorus, though an Epicurean, spoke thus, divinely inspired:
   "Remember, O Menestratus, that, being a mortal endowed with a
   circumscribed life, thou hast in thy soul ascended, till thou hast seen
   endless time, and the infinity of things; and what is to be, and what
   has been;" when with the blessed choir, according to Plato, we shall
   gaze on the blessed sight and vision; we following with Zeus, and
   others with other deities, if we may be permitted so to say, to receive
   initiation into the most blessed mystery: which we shall celebrate,
   ourselves being perfect and untroubled by the ills which awaited us at
   the end of our time; and introduced to the knowledge of perfect and
   tranquil visions, and contemplating them in pure sunlight; we ourselves
   pure, and now no longer distinguished by that, which, when carrying it
   about, we call the body, being bound to it like an oyster to its shell.

   The Pythagoreans call heaven the Antichthon [the opposite Earth]. And
   in this land, it is said by Jeremiah, "I will place thee among the
   children, and give thee the chosen land as inheritance of God
   Omnipotent;" [3184] and they who inherit it shall reign over the earth.
   Myriads on myriads of examples [3185] rush on my mind which might
   adduce. But for the sake of symmetry the discourse must now stop, in
   order that we may not exemplify the saying of Agatho the tragedian:--


   "Treating our by-work as work,

   And doing our work as by-work."

   It having been, then, as I think, clearly shown in what way it is to be
   understood that the Greeks were called thieves by the Lord, I willingly
   leave the dogmas of the philosophers. For were we to go over their
   sayings, we should gather together directly such a quantity of notes,
   in showing that the whole of the Hellenic wisdom was derived from the
   Barbarian philosophy. But this speculation, we shall, nevertheless,
   again touch on, as necessity requires, when we collect the opinions
   current among the Greeks respecting first principles.

   But from what has been said, it tacitly devolves on us to consider in
   what way the Hellenic books are to be perused by the man who is able to
   pass through the billows in them. Therefore


   "Happy is he who possesses the wealth of the divine mind,"

   as appears according to Empedocles,


   "But wretched he, who cares for dark opinion about the Gods."

   He divinely showed knowledge and ignorance to be the boundaries of
   happiness and misery. "For it behoves philosophers to be acquainted
   with very many things," according to Heraclitus; and truly must


   "He, who seeks to be good, err in many things."

   It is then now clear to us, from what has been said, that the
   beneficence of God is eternal, and that, from an unbeginning principle,
   equal natural righteousness reached all, according to the worth of each
   several race,--never having had a beginning. For God did not make a
   beginning of being Lord and Good, being always what He is. Nor will He
   ever cease to do good, although He bring all things to an end. And each
   one of us is a partaker of His beneficence, as far as He wills. For the
   difference of the elect is made by the intervention of a choice worthy
   of the soul, and by exercise.

   Thus, then, let our fifth Miscellany of gnostic notes in accordance
   with the true philosophy be brought to a close.

  Elucidations.

      I.

   (Clement's Hebrew, p. 446, [100]note 8.)

   On this matter having spoken in a former Elucidation (see
   [101]Elucidation VIII. p. 443), I must here translate a few words from
   Philo Judæus. He says, "Before Abram was called, such was his name; but
   afterward he was named Abraam, by the simple duplication of one letter,
   which nevertheless enfolds a great significance. For Abram is expounded
   to mean sublime father, but Abraam means elect father of sound." Philo
   goes on to give his personal fancies in explication of this whim. But,
   with Clement, Philo was an expert, to whom all knowledge was to be
   credited in his specialty. This passage, however, confirms the opinion
   of those who pronounce Clement destitute of Hebrew, even in its
   elements. No need to say that Abram means something like what Philo
   gives us, but Abraham is expounded in the Bible itself (Genesis 17:3).
   The text of the LXX, seems to have been dubious to our author's mind,
   and hence he fails back on Philo. But this of itself appears decisive
   as to Clement's Hebrew scholarship.

      II.

   (The Beetle, cap. iv. p. 449, [102]note 6.)

   Cicero notes the scarabæus on the tongue, as identifying Apis, [3186]
   the calf-god of the Egyptians. Now, this passage of our author seems to
   me to clear up the Scriptural word gillulim in Deut. xxix. 17, where
   the English margin reads, literally enough, dungy-gods. The word means,
   things rolled about (Lev. xxvi. 30; Hab. ii. 18, 19; 1 Kings xv. 12);
   on which compare Leighton (St. Peter, pp. 239, 746, and note).
   Scripture seems to prove that this story of Clement's about the beetle
   of the Egyptians, was known to the ancient Hebrews, and was the point
   in their references to the gillulim (see Herod., book iii. cap. 28., or
   Rawlinson's Trans., vol. ii. 353). The note in Migne ad loc. is also
   well-worthy to be consulted.

      III.

   (The Tetrad, cap. vi. p. 452, [103]note 4.)

   It is important to observe that "the patriarchal dispensation," as we
   too carelessly speak, is pluralized by Clement. He clearly
   distinguishes the three patriarchal dispensations, as given in Adam,
   Noah, and Abraham; and then comes the Mosaic. The editor begs to be
   pardoned for referring to his venerated and gifted father's division
   (sustained by Clement's authority), which he used to insist should be
   further enlarged so as to subdivide the first and the last, making
   seven complete, and thus honouring the system of sevens which runs
   through all Scripture. Thus Adam embraces Paradise, and the first
   covenant after the fall; and the Christian covenant embraces a
   millennial period. So that we have (1) Paradise, (2) Adam, (3) Noah (4)
   Abraham, (5) Moses, (6) Christ (7) a millennial period, preluding the
   Judgment and the Everlasting Kingdom. My venerated and most erudite
   instructor in theology, the late Dr. Jarvis, in his Church of the
   Redeemed, expounds a dispensation as identified by (1) a covenant,
   original or renewed, (2) a sign or sacrament, and (3) a closing
   judgment. (See pp. 4, 5, and elsewhere in the great work I have named.)
   Thus (1) the Tree of Life, (2) the institution of sacrifice, (3) the
   rainbow, (4) circumcision, (5) the ark, (6) the baptismal and
   eucharistic sacraments, and (7) the same renewed and glorified by the
   conversion of nations are the symbols. The covenants and the judgments
   are easily identified, ending with the universal Judgment.

   Dr. Jarvis died, leaving his work unfinished; but the Church of the
   Redeemed is a book complete in itself, embodying the results of a vast
   erudition, and of a devout familiarity with Scripture. It begins with
   Adam, and ends with the downfall of Jerusalem (the typical judgment),
   which closed the Mosaic dispensation. It is written in a pellucid
   style, and with a fastidious use of the English language; and it is the
   noblest introduction to the understanding of the New Testament, with
   which I am acquainted. That such a work should be almost unknown in
   American literature, of which it should be a conspicuous ornament, is a
   sad commentary upon the taste of the period when it was given to the
   public. [3187]

      IV.

   (The Golden Candlestick, cap. vi. p. 452, [104]note 6.)

   The seven gifts of the Spirit seem to be prefigured in this symbol,
   corresponding to the seven (spirits) lamps before the throne in the
   vision of St. John (see Rev. i. 4, iii. 1, iv. 5, and v. 6; also Isa.
   xi. 1, 2, and Zech. iii. 9, and iv. 10). The prediction of Isaiah
   intimates the anointing of Jesus at his baptism, and the outpouring of
   these gifts upon the Christian Church.

      V.

   (Symbols, cap. vi. p. 453, note 3.)

   Clement regards the symbols of the divine law as symbols merely, and
   not images in the sense of the Decalogue. Whatever we may think of this
   distinction, his argument destroys the fallacy of the Trent Catechism,
   which pleads the Levitical symbols in favour of images in "the likeness
   of holy things," and which virtually abrogates the second commandment.
   Images of God the Father (crowned with the Papal tiara) are everywhere
   to be seen in the Latin churches, and countless images of all heavenly
   things are everywhere worshipped under the fallacy which Clement
   rejects. Pascal exposes the distinctions without a difference, by which
   God's laws are evacuated of all force in Jesuit theology; but the
   hairsplitting distinctions, about "bowing down to images and
   worshipping them," which infect the Trent theology, are equal to the
   worst of Pascal's instances. [3188] It is with profound regret that I
   insert this testimony; but it seems necessary, because garblings of
   patristic authorities, which begin to appear in America, make an
   accurate and intelligent study of the Ante-Nicene Fathers a necessity
   for the American theologian.

      VI.

   (Perfection, cap. x. p. 459, [105]note 2.)

   The teleioi of the ancient canons were rather the complete than the
   perfect, as understood by the ancients. Clement's Gnostic is
   "complete," and goes on to moral perfection. Now, does not St. Paul
   make a similar distinction between babes in Christ, and those "complete
   in Him?"(Col. ii. 10.) The pepleromenoi of this passage, referring to
   the "thoroughly furnished" Christian (fully equipped for his work and
   warfare), has thrown light on many passages of the fathers and of the
   old canons, in my experience; and I merely make the suggestion for what
   it may be worth. See Bunsen's Church and Home Book (Hippol., iii. 82,
   83, et seqq.) for the rules (1) governing all Christians, and (2) those
   called "the faithful," by way of eminence. So, in our days, not all
   believers are communicants.

      VII.

   (The Unknown God, cap. xii. p. 464, [106]note 1.)

   Must we retain "too superstitious," even in the Revised Version? (Which
   see ad loc.) Bunsen's rendering of deisidaimonia, by demon-fear, [3189]
   is not English; but it suggests the common view of scholars, upon the
   passage, and leads me to suppose that the learned and venerable company
   of revisers could not agree on any English that would answer. That St.
   Paul paid the Athenians a compliment, as devout in their way, i.e., God
   fearing towards their divinities, will not be denied. Clement seems to
   have so understood it, and hence his constant effort to show that we
   must recognise, in dealing with Gentiles, whatever of elementary good
   God has permitted to exist among them. May we not admit this principle,
   at least so far as to believe that Divine Providence led the Athenians
   to set up the very inscription which was to prompt Christ's apostle to
   an ingenious interpretation, and to an equally ingenious use of it, so
   avoiding a direct conflict with their laws? This they had charged on
   him (Acts xvii. 18), as before on Socrates.

      VIII.

   (Xenocrates and Democritus, cap. xiii. p. 465, note 3.)

   My grave and studious reader will forgive me, here, for a reference to
   Stromata of a widely different sort. Dulce est desipere, etc. One
   sometimes finds instruction and relief amid the intense nonsense of
   "agnostic" and other "philosophies" of our days, in turning to a
   healthful intellect which "answers fools according to their folly." I
   confess myself an occasional reader of the vastly entertaining and
   suggestive Noctes of Christopher North, which may be excused by the
   famous example of a Father of the Church, who delighted in
   Aristophanes. [3190] To illustrate this passage of Clement, then, let
   me refer to Professor Wilson's intense sympathy with animals. See the
   real eloquence of his reference to the dogs of Homer and of Sir Walter
   Scott. [3191] "The Ettrick Shepherd" somewhere wondered, whether some
   dogs are not gifted with souls; and, in the passage referred to, it is
   asked, whether the dog of Ulysses could have been destitute of an
   immortal spirit. On another occasion, Christopher breaks out with
   something like this: "Let me prefer the man who thinks so, to the
   miserable atheist whose creed is dust." He looks upon his dog "Fro,"
   and continues (while the noble animal seems listening), "Yes, better a
   thousand times, O Fro, to believe that my faithful dog shall bear me
   company,' than that the soul of a Newton perishes at death," etc. How
   often have I regaled myself with the wholesome tonic of such dog loving
   sport, after turning with disgust from some God hating and
   mandestroying argument of "modern science," falsely so called.

      IX.

   (Plato's Prophecy, cap. xiv. p. 470, [107]note 2.)

   My references at this point are worthy of being enlarged upon. I
   subjoin the following as additional. On this sublime passage, Jones of
   Nayland remarks, [3192] "The greatest moral philosopher of the Greeks
   declared, with a kind of prescience, that, if a man perfectly just were
   to come upon earth, he would be impoverished and scourged, and bound as
   a criminal; and, when he had suffered all manner of indignities, would
   be put to the shameful death of (suspension or) crucifixion." "Several
   of the Fathers," he adds, "have taken notice of this extraordinary
   passage in Plato, looking upon it as a prediction of the sufferings of
   the Just One, Jesus Christ." He refers us to Grotius (De Veritate, iv.
   sec. 12) and to Meric Casaubon (On Credulity, p. 135). The passage from
   Plato (Rep., ii. 5) impressed the mind of Cicero. (See his Rep., iii.
   17.)

The Stromata, or Miscellanies

  Book VI.
     __________________________________________________________________
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter I.--Plan. [3193]

   The sixth and also the seventh Miscellany of gnostic notes, in
   accordance with the true philosophy, having delineated as well as
   possible the ethical argument conveyed in them, and having exhibited
   what the Gnostic is in his life, proceed to show the philosophers that
   he is by no means impious, as they suppose, but that he alone is truly
   pious, by a compendious exhibition of the Gnostic's form of religion,
   as far as it is possible, without danger, to commit it to writing in a
   book of reference. For the Lord enjoined "to labour for the meat which
   endureth to eternity." [3194] And the prophet says, "Blessed is he that
   soweth into all waters, whose ox and ass tread," [3195] [that is,] the
   people, from the Law and from the Gentiles, gathered into one faith.

   "Now the weak eateth herbs," according to the noble apostle. [3196] The
   Instructor, divided by us into three books, has already exhibited the
   training and nurture up from the state of childhood, that is, the
   course of life which from elementary instruction grows by faith; and in
   the case of those enrolled in the number of men, prepares beforehand
   the soul, endued with virtue, for the reception of gnostic knowledge.
   The Greeks, then, clearly learning, from what shall be said by us in
   these pages, that in profanely persecuting the God-loving man, they
   themselves act impiously; then, as the notes advance, in accordance
   with the style of the Miscellanies, we must solve the difficulties
   raised both by Greeks and Barbarians with respect to the coming of the
   Lord.

   In a meadow the flowers blooming variously, and in a park the
   plantations of fruit trees, are not separated according to their
   species from those of other kinds. If some, culling varieties, have
   composed learned collections, Meadows, and Helicons, and Honeycombs,
   and Robes; then, with the things which come to recollection by
   haphazard, and are expurgated neither in order nor expression, but
   purposely scattered, the form of the Miscellanies is promiscuously
   variegated like a meadow. And such being the case, my notes shall serve
   as kindling sparks; and in the case of him, who is fit for knowledge,
   if he chance to fall in with them, research made with exertion will
   turn out to his benefit and advantage. For it is right that labour
   should precede not only food but also, much more knowledge, in the case
   of those that are advancing to the eternal and blessed salvation by the
   "strait and narrow way," which is truly the Lord's.

   Our knowledge, and our spiritual garden, is the Saviour Himself; into
   whom we are planted, being transferred and transplanted, from our old
   life, into the good land. And transplanting contributes to
   fruitfulness. The Lord, then, into whom we have been transplanted, is
   the Light and the true Knowledge.

   Now knowledge is otherwise spoken of in a twofold sense: that, commonly
   so called, which appears in all men (similarly also comprehension and
   apprehension), universally, in the knowledge of individual objects; in
   which not only the rational powers, but equally the irrational, share,
   which I would never term knowledge, inasmuch as the apprehension of
   things through the senses comes naturally. But that which par
   excellence is termed knowledge, bears the impress of judgment and
   reason, in the exercise of which there will be rational cognitions
   alone, applying purely to objects of thought, and resulting from the
   bare energy of the soul. "He is a good man," says David, [3197] "who
   pities" (those ruined through error), "and lends" (from the
   communication of the word of truth) not at haphazard, for "he will
   dispense his words in judgment:" with profound calculation, "he hath
   dispersed, he hath given to the poor."

      Chapter II.--The Subject of Plagiarisms Resumed. The Greeks Plagiarized
      from One Another.

   Before handling the point proposed, we must, by way of preface, add to
   the close of the fifth book what is wanting. For since we have shown
   that the symbolical style was ancient, and was employed not only by our
   prophets, but also by the majority of the ancient Greeks, and by not a
   few of the rest of the Gentile Barbarians, it was requisite to proceed
   to the mysteries of the initiated. I postpone the elucidation of these
   till we advance to the confutation of what is said by the Greeks on
   first principles; for we shall show that the mysteries belong to the
   same branch of speculation. And having proved that the declaration of
   Hellenic thought is illuminated all round by the truth, bestowed on us
   in the Scriptures, taking it according to the sense, we have proved,
   not to say what is invidious, that the theft of the truth passed to
   them.

   Come, and let us adduce the Greeks as witnesses against themselves to
   the theft. For, inasmuch as they pilfer from one another, they
   establish the fact that they are thieves; and although against their
   will, they are detected, clandestinely appropriating to those of their
   own race the truth which belongs to us. For if they do not keep their
   hands from each other, they will hardly do it from our authors. I shall
   say nothing of philosophic dogmas, since the very persons who are the
   authors of the divisions into sects, confess in writing, so as not to
   be convicted of ingratitude, that they have received from Socrates the
   most important of their dogmas. But after availing myself of a few
   testimonies of men most talked of, and of repute among the Greeks, and
   exposing their plagiarizing style, and selecting them from various
   periods, I shall turn to what follows.

   Orpheus, then, having composed the line:--


   "Since nothing else is more shameless and wretched than woman,"

   Homer plainly says:--


   "Since nothing else is more dreadful and shameless than a woman."
   [3198]

   And Musæus having written:--


   "Since art is greatly superior to strength,"--

   Homer says:--


   "By art rather than strength is the woodcutter greatly superior."
   [3199]

   Again, Musæus having composed the lines:--


   "And as the fruitful field produceth leaves,

   And on the ash trees some fade, others grow,

   So whirls the race of man its leaf," [3200] --

   Homer transcribes:--


   "Some of the leaves the wind strews on the ground.

   The budding wood bears some; in time of spring,

   They come. So springs one race of men, and one departs." [3201]

   Again, Homer having said:--


   "It is unholy to exult over dead men," [3202]

   Archilochus and Cratinus write, the former:--


   "It is not noble at dead men to sneer;"

   and Cratinus in the Lacones:--


   "For men 'tis dreadful to exult

   Much o'er the stalwart dead."

   Again, Archilochus, transferring that Homeric line:--


   "I erred, nor say I nay: instead of many" [3203] --

   writes thus:--


   "I erred, and this mischief hath somehow seized another."

   As certainly also that line:--


   "Even-handed [3204] war the slayer slays." [3205]

   He also, altering, has given forth thus:--


   "I will do it.

   For Mars to men in truth is evenhanded." [3206]

   Also, translating the following:--


   "The issues of victory among men depend on the gods," [3207]

   he openly encourages youth, in the following iambic:--


   "Victory's issues on the gods depend."

   Again, Homer having said:--


   "With feet unwashed sleeping on the ground," [3208]

   Euripides writes in Erechtheus:--


   "Upon the plain spread with no couch they sleep,

   Nor in the streams of water lave their feet."

   Archilochus having likewise said:--


   "But one with this and one with that

   His heart delights,"--

   in correspondence with the Homeric line:--


   "For one in these deeds, one in those delights," [3209] --

   Euripides says in OEneus:--


   "But one in these ways, one in those, has more delight."

   And I have heard Æschylus saying:--


   "He who is happy ought to stay at home;

   There should he also stay, who speeds not well."

   And Euripides, too, shouting the like on the stage:--


   "Happy the man who, prosperous, stays at home."

   Menander, too, on comedy, saying:--


   "He ought at home to stay, and free remain,

   Or be no longer rightly happy."

   Again, Theognis having said:--


   "The exile has no comrade dear and true,"--

   Euripides has written:--


   "Far from the poor flies every friend."

   And Epicharmus, saying:--


   "Daughter, woe worth the day!

   Thee who art old I marry to a youth;" [3210]

   and adding:--


   "For the young husband takes some other girl,

   And for another husband longs the wife,"--

   Euripides [3211] writes:--


   "'Tis bad to yoke an old wife to a youth;

   For he desires to share another's bed,

   And she, by him deserted, mischief plots."

   Euripides having, besides, said in the Medea:--


   "For no good do a bad man's gifts,"--

   Sophocles in Ajax Flagellifer utters this iambic:--


   "For foes' gifts are no gifts, nor any boon." [3212]

   Solon having written:--


   "For surfeit insolence begets,

   When store of wealth attends."

   Theognis writes in the same way:--


   "For surfeit insolence begets,

   When store of wealth attends the bad."

   Whence also Thucydides, in the Histories, says: "Many men, to whom in a
   great degree, and in a short time, unlooked-for prosperity comes, are
   wont to turn to insolence." And Philistus [3213] likewise imitates the
   same sentiment, expressing himself thus: "And the many things which
   turn out prosperously to men, in accordance with reason, have an
   incredibly dangerous [3214] tendency to misfortune. For those who meet
   with unlooked success beyond their expectations, are for the most part
   wont to turn to insolence." Again, Euripides having written:--


   "For children sprung of parents who have led

   A hard and toilsome life, superior are;"

   Critias writes: "For I begin with a man's origin: how far the best and
   strongest in body will he be, if his father exercises himself, and eats
   in a hardy way, and subjects his body to toilsome labour; and if the
   mother of the future child be strong in body, and give herself
   exercise."

   Again, Homer having said of the Hephæstus-made shield:--


   "Upon it earth and heaven and sea he made,

   And Ocean's rivers' mighty strength portrayed,"

   Pherecydes of Syros says:--"Zas makes a cloak large and beautiful, and
   works on it earth and Ogenus, and the palace of Ogenus."

   And Homer having said:--


   "Shame, which greatly hurts a man or helps," [3215] --

   Euripides writes in Erechtheus:--


   "Of shame I find it hard to judge;

   'Tis needed. 'Tis at times a great mischief."

   Take, by way of parallel, such plagiarisms as the following, from those
   who flourished together, and were rivals of each other. From the
   Orestes of Euripides:--


   "Dear charm of sleep, aid in disease."

   From the Eriphyle of Sophocles:--


   "Hie thee to sleep, healer of that disease."

   And from the Antigone of Sophocles:--


   "Bastardy is opprobrious in name; but the nature is equal;" [3216]

   And from the Aleuades of Sophocles:--


   "Each good thing has its nature equal."

   Again, in the Ctimenus [3217] of Euripides:--


   "For him who toils, God helps;"

   And in the Minos of Sophocles;


   "To those who act not, fortune is no ally;"

   And from the Alexander of Euripides:--


   "But time will show; and learning, by that test,

   I shall know whether thou art good or bad;"

   And from the Hipponos of Sophocles:--


   "Besides, conceal thou nought; since Time,

   That sees all, hears all, all things will unfold."

   But let us similarly run over the following; for Eumelus having
   composed the line,


   "Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the daughters nine,"

   Solon thus begins the elegy:--


   "Of Memory and Olympian Zeus the children bright."

   Again, Euripides, paraphrasing the Homeric line:--


   "What, whence art thou? Thy city and thy parents, where?" [3218]

   employs the following iambics in Ægeus:--


   "What country shall we say that thou hast left

   To roam in exile, what thy land--the bound

   Of thine own native soil? Who thee begat?

   And of what father dost thou call thyself the son?"

   And what? Theognis [3219] having said:--


   "Wine largely drunk is bad; but if one use

   It with discretion, 'tis not bad, but good,"--

   does not Panyasis write?


   "Above the gods' best gift to men ranks wine,

   In measure drunk; but in excess the worst."

   Hesiod, too, saying:--


   "But for the fire to thee I'll give a plague, [3220]

   For all men to delight themselves withal,"--

   Euripides writes:--


   "And for the fire

   Another fire greater and unconquerable,

   Sprung up in the shape of women" [3221]

   And in addition, Homer, saying:--


   "There is no satiating the greedy paunch,

   Baneful, which many plagues has caused to men." [3222]

   Euripides says:--


   "Dire need and baneful paunch me overcome;

   From which all evils come."

   Besides, Callias the comic poet having written:--


   "With madmen, all men must be mad, they say,"--

   Menander, in the Poloumenoi, expresses himself similarly, saying:--


   "The presence of wisdom is not always suitable:

   One sometimes must with others play [3223] the fool."

   And Antimachus of Teos having said:--


   "From gifts, to mortals many ills arise,"--

   Augias composed the line:--


   "For gifts men's mind and acts deceive."

   And Hesiod having said:--


   "Than a good wife, no man a better thing

   Ere gained; than a bad wife, a worse,"--

   Simonides said:--


   "A better prize than a good wife no man

   Ere gained, than a bad one nought worse."

   Again, Epicharmas having said:--


   "As destined long to live, and yet not long,

   Think of thyself."--

   Euripides writes:--


   "Why? seeing the wealth we have uncertain is,

   Why don't we live as free from care, as pleasant

   As we may?"

   Similarly also, the comic poet Diphilus having said:--


   "The life of men is prone to change,"--

   Posidippus says:--


   "No man of mortal mould his life has passed

   From suffering free. Nor to the end again

   Has continued prosperous."

   Similarly [3224] speaks to thee Plato, writing of man as a creature
   subject to change. Again, Euripides having said:--


   "Oh life to mortal men of trouble full,

   How slippery in everything art thou!

   Now grow'st thou, and thou now decay'st away.

   And there is set no limit, no, not one,

   For mortals of their course to make an end,

   Except when Death's remorseless final end

   Comes, sent from Zeus,"--

   Diphilus writes:--


   "There is no life which has not its own ills,

   Pains, cares, thefts, and anxieties, disease;

   And Death, as a physician, coming, gives

   Rest to their victims in his quiet sleep." [3225]

   Furthermore, Euripides having said:--


   "Many are fortune's shapes,

   And many things contrary to expectation the gods perform,"--

   The tragic poet Theodectes similarly writes:--


   "The instability of mortals' fates."

   And Bacchylides having said:--


   "To few [3226] alone of mortals is it given

   To reach hoary age, being prosperous all the while,

   And not meet with calamities,"--

   Moschion, the comic poet, writes:--


   "But he of all men is most blest,

   Who leads throughout an equal life."

   And you will find that, Theognis having said:--


   "For no advantage to a man grown old

   A young wife is, who will not, as a ship

   The helm, obey,"--

   Aristophanes, the comic poet, writes:--


   "An old man to a young wife suits but ill."

   For Anacreon, having written:--


   "Luxurious love I sing,

   With flowery garlands graced,

   He is of gods the king,

   He mortal men subdues,--

   Euripides writes:--


   "For love not only men attacks,

   And women; but disturbs

   The souls of gods above, and to the sea

   Descends."

   But not to protract the discourse further, in our anxiety to show the
   propensity of the Greeks to plagiarism in expressions and dogmas, allow
   us to adduce the express testimony of Hippias, the sophist of Elea, who
   discourses on the point in hand, and speaks thus: "Of these things some
   perchance are said by Orpheus, some briefly by Musæus; some in one
   place, others in other places; some by Hesiod, some by Homer, some by
   the rest of the poets; and some in prose compositions, some by Greeks,
   some by Barbarians. And I from all these, placing together the things
   of most importance and of kindred character, will make the present
   discourse new and varied."

   And in order that we may see that philosophy and history, and even
   rhetoric, are not free of a like reproach, it is right to adduce a few
   instances from them. For Alcmæon of Crotona having said, "It is easier
   to guard against a man who is an enemy than a friend," Sophocles wrote
   in the Antigone:--


   "For what sore more grievous than a bad friend?"

   And Xenophon said: "No man can injure enemies in any way other than by
   appearing to be a friend."

   And Euripides having said in Telephus:--


   "Shall we Greeks be slaves to Barbarians?"--

   Thrasymachus, in the oration for the Larissæans, says: "Shall we be
   slaves to Archelaus--Greeks to a Barbarian?"

   And Orpheus having said:--


   "Water is the change for soul, and death for water;

   From water is earth, and what comes from earth is again water,

   And from that, soul, which changes the whole ether;"

   and Heraclitus, putting together the expressions from these lines,
   writes thus:--


   "It is death for souls to become water, and death for

   water to become earth; and from earth comes water,

   and from water soul."

   And Athamas the Pythagorean having said, "Thus was produced the
   beginning of the universe; and there are four roots--fire, water, air,
   earth: for from these is the origination of what is
   produced,"--Empedocles of Agrigentum wrote:--


   "The four roots of all things first do thou hear--

   Fire, water, earth, and ether's boundless height:

   For of these all that was, is, shall be, comes."

   And Plato having said, "Wherefore also the gods, knowing men, release
   sooner from life those they value most," Menander wrote:--


   "Whom the gods love, dies young."

   And Euripides having written in the OEnomaus:--


   "We judge of things obscure from what we see;"

   and in the Phoenix:--


   "By signs the obscure is fairly grasped,"--

   Hyperides says, "But we must investigate things unseen by learning from
   signs and probabilities." And Isocrates having said, "We must
   conjecture the future by the past," Andocides does not shrink from
   saying, "For we must make use of what has happened previously as signs
   in reference to what is to be." Besides, Theognis having said:--


   "The evil of counterfeit silver and gold is not intolerable,

   O Cyrnus, and to a wise man is not difficult of detection;

   But if the mind of a friend is hidden in his breast,

   If he is false, [3227] and has a treacherous heart within,

   This is the basest thing for mortals, caused by God,

   And of all things the hardest to detect,"--

   Euripides writes:--


   "Oh Zeus, why hast thou given to men clear tests

   Of spurious gold, while on the body grows

   No mark sufficing to discover clear

   The wicked man?"

   Hyperides himself also says, "There is no feature of the mind impressed
   on the countenance of men."

   Again, Stasinus having composed the line:--


   "Fool, who, having slain the father, leaves the children,"--

   Xenophon [3228] says, "For I seem to myself to have acted in like
   manner, as if one who killed the father should spare his children." And
   Sophocles having written in the Antigone:--


   "Mother and father being in Hades now,

   No brother ever can to me spring forth,"--

   Herodotus says, "Mother and father being no more, I shall not have
   another brother." In addition to these, Theopompus having written:--


   "Twice children are old men in very truth;"

   And before him Sophocles in Peleus:--


   "Peleus, the son of Æacus, I, sole housekeeper,

   Guide, old as he is now, and train again,

   For the aged man is once again a child,"--

   Antipho the orator says, "For the nursing of the old is like the
   nursing of children." Also the philosopher Plato says, "The old man
   then, as seems, will be twice a child." Further, Thucydides having
   said, "We alone bore the brunt at Marathon," [3229] --Demosthenes said,
   "By those who bore the brunt at Marathon." Nor will I omit the
   following. Cratinus having said in the Pytine: [3230] --


   "The preparation perchance you know,"

   Andocides the orator says, "The preparation, gentlemen of the jury, and
   the eagerness of our enemies, almost all of you know." Similarly also
   Nicias, in the speech on the deposit, against Lysias, says, "The
   preparation and the eagerness of the adversaries, ye see, O gentlemen
   of the jury." After him Æschines says, "You see the preparation, O men
   of Athens, and the line of battle." Again, Demosthenes having said,
   "What zeal and what canvassing, O men of Athens, have been employed in
   this contest, I think almost all of you are aware;" and Philinus
   similarly, "What zeal, what forming of the line of battle, gentlemen of
   the jury, have taken place in this contest, I think not one of you is
   ignorant." Isocrates, again, having said, "As if she were related to
   his wealth, not him," Lysias says in the Orphics, "And he was plainly
   related not to the persons, but to the money." Since Homer also having
   written:--


   "O friend, if in this war, by taking flight,

   We should from age and death exemption win,

   I would not fight among the first myself,

   Nor would I send thee to the glorious fray;

   But now--for myriad fates of death attend

   In any case, which man may not escape

   Or shun--come on. To some one we shall bring

   Renown, or some one shall to us," [3231] --

   Theopompus writes, "For if, by avoiding the present danger, we were to
   pass the rest of our time in security, to show love of life would not
   be wonderful. But now, so many fatalities are incident to life, that
   death in battle seems preferable." And what? Child the sophist having
   uttered the apophthegm, "Become surety, and mischief is at hand," did
   not Epicharmus utter the same sentiment in other terms, when he said,
   "Suretyship is the daughter of mischief, and loss that of suretyship?"
   [3232] Further, Hippocrates the physician having written, "You must
   look to time, and locality, and age, and disease," Euripides says in
   Hexameters: [3233] --


   "Those who the healing art would practice well,

   Must study people's modes of life, and note

   The soil, and the diseases so consider."

   Homer again, having written:--


   "I say no mortal man can doom escape,"--

   Archinus says, "All men are bound to die either sooner or later;" and
   Demosthenes, "To all men death is the end of life, though one should
   keep himself shut up in a coop."

   And Herodotus, again, having said, in his discourse about Glaucus the
   Spartan, that the Pythian said, "In the case of the Deity, to say and
   to do are equivalent," Aristophanes said:--


   "For to think and to do are equivalent."

   And before him, Parmenides of Elea said:--


   "For thinking and being are the same."

   And Plato having said, "And we shall show, not absurdly perhaps, that
   the beginning of love is sight; and hope diminishes the passion, memory
   nourishes it, and intercourse preserves it;" does not Philemon the
   comic poet write:--


   "First all see, then admire;

   Then gaze, then come to hope;

   And thus arises love?"

   Further, Demosthenes having said, "For to all of us death is a debt,"
   and so forth, Phanocles writes in Loves, or The Beautiful:--


   "But from the Fates' unbroken thread escape

   Is none for those that feed on earth."

   You will also find that Plato having said, "For the first sprout of
   each plant, having got a fair start, according to the virtue of its own
   nature, is most powerful in inducing the appropriate end;" the
   historian writes, "Further, it is not natural for one of the wild
   plants to become cultivated, after they have passed the earlier period
   of growth;" and the following of Empedocles:--


   "For I already have been boy and girl,

   And bush, and bird, and mute fish in the sea,"--

   Euripides transcribes in Chrysippus:--


   "But nothing dies

   Of things that are; but being dissolved,

   One from the other,

   Shows another form."

   And Plato having said, in the Republic, that women were common,
   Euripides writes in the Protesilaus:--


   "For common, then, is woman's bed."

   Further, Euripides having written:--


   "For to the temperate enough sufficient is"--

   Epicurus expressly says, "Sufficiency is the greatest riches of all."

   Again, Aristophanes having written:--


   "Life thou securely shalt enjoy, being just

   And free from turmoil, and from fear live well,"--

   Epicurus says, "The greatest fruit of righteousness is tranquillity."

   Let these species, then, of Greek plagiarism of sentiments, being such,
   stand as sufficient for a clear specimen to him who is capable of
   perceiving.

   And not only have they been detected pirating and paraphrasing thoughts
   and expressions, as will be shown; but they will also be convicted of
   the possession of what is entirely stolen. For stealing entirely what
   is the production of others, they have published it as their own; as
   Eugamon of Cyrene did the entire book on the Thesprotians from Musæus,
   and Pisander of Camirus the Heraclea of Pisinus of Lindus, and Panyasis
   of Halicarnassus, the capture of OEchalia from Cleophilus of Samos.

   You will also find that Homer, the great poet, took from Orpheus, from
   the Disappearance of Dionysus, those words and what follows verbatim:--


   "As a man trains a luxuriant shoot of olive." [3234]

   And in the Theogony, it is said by Orpheus of Kronos:--


   "He lay, his thick neck bent aside; and him

   All-conquering Sleep had seized."

   These Homer transferrred to the Cyclops. [3235] And Hesiod writes of
   Melampous:--


   "Gladly to hear, what the immortals have assigned

   To men, the brave from cowards clearly marks;"

   and so forth, taking it word for word from the poet Musæus.

   And Aristophanes the comic poet has, in the first of the
   Thesmophoriazusæ, transferred the words from the Empiprameni of
   Cratinus. And Plato the comic poet, and Aristophanes in Dædalus, steal
   from one another. Cocalus, composed by Araros, [3236] the son of
   Aristophanes, was by the comic poet Philemon altered, and made into the
   comedy called Hypobolimoens.

   Eumelus and Acusilaus the historiographers changed the contents of
   Hesiod into prose, and published them as their own. Gorgias of Leontium
   and Eudemus of Naxus, the historians, stole from Melesagoras. And,
   besides, there is Bion of Proconnesus, who epitomized and transcribed
   the writings of the ancient Cadmus, and Archilochus, and Aristotle, and
   Leandrus, and Hellanicus, and Hecatæus, and Androtion, and Philochorus.
   Dieuchidas of Megara transferred the beginning of his treatise from the
   Deucalion of Hellanicus. I pass over in silence Heraclitus of Ephesus,
   who took a very great deal from Orpheus.

   From Pythagoras Plato derived the immortality of the soul; and he from
   the Egyptians. And many of the Platonists composed books, in which they
   show that the Stoics, as we said in the beginning, and Aristotle, took
   the most and principal of their dogmas from Plato. Epicurus also
   pilfered his leading dogmas from Democritus. Let these things then be
   so. For life would fail me, were I to undertake to go over the subject
   in detail, to expose the selfish plagiarism of the Greeks, and how they
   claim the discovery of the best of their doctrines, which they have
   received from us.

   the passage as it stands in Homer.

   [3216] The text has doie, which Stobæus has changed into d' ise, as

   "The bastard has equal strength with the legitimate;

   Each good thing has its nature legitimate."

      Chapter III.--Plagiarism by the Greeks of the Miracles Related in the
      Sacred Books of the Hebrews.

   And now they are convicted not only of borrowing doctrines from the
   Barbarians, but also of relating as prodigies of Hellenic mythology the
   marvels found in our records, wrought through divine power from above,
   by those who led holy lives, while devoting attention to us. And we
   shall ask at them whether those things which they relate are true or
   false. But they will not say that they are false; for they will not
   with their will condemn themselves of the very great silliness of
   composing falsehoods, but of necessity admit them to be true. And how
   will the prodigies enacted by Moses and the other prophets any longer
   appear to them incredible? For the Almighty God, in His care for all
   men, turns some to salvation by commands, some by threats, some by
   miraculous signs, some by gentle promises.

   Well, the Greeks, when once a drought had wasted Greece for a
   protracted period, and a dearth of the fruits of the earth ensued, it
   is said, those that survived of them, having, because of the famine,
   come as suppliants to Delphi, asked the Pythian priestess how they
   should be released from the calamity. She announced that the only help
   in their distress was, that they should avail themselves of the prayers
   of Æacus. Prevailed on by them, Æacus, ascending the Hellenic hill, and
   stretching out pure [3237] hands to heaven, and invoking the common
   [3238] God, besought him to pity wasted Greece. And as he prayed,
   thunder sounded, out of the usual course of things, and the whole
   surrounding atmosphere was covered with clouds. And impetuous and
   continued rains, bursting down, filled the whole region. The result was
   a copious and rich fertility wrought by the husbandry of the prayers of
   Æacus.

   "And Samuel called on the Lord," it is said, "and the Lord gave forth
   His voice, and rain in the day of harvest." [3239] Do you see that "He
   who sendeth His rain on the just and on the unjust" [3240] by the
   subject powers is the one God? And the whole of our Scripture is full
   of instances of God, in reference to the prayers of the just, hearing
   and performing each one of their petitions.

   Again, the Greeks relate, that in the case of a failure once of the
   Etesian winds, Aristæus once sacrificed in Ceus to Isthmian Zeus. For
   there was great devastation, everything being burnt up with the heat in
   consequence of the winds which had been wont to refresh the productions
   of the earth, not blowing, and he easily called them back.

   And at Delphi, on the expedition of Xerxes against Greece, the Pythian
   priestess having made answer:--


   "O Delphians, pray the winds, and it will be better,"--

   they having erected an altar and performed sacrifice to the winds, had
   them as their helpers. For, blowing violently around Cape Sepias, they
   shivered the whole preparations of the Persian expedition. Empedocles
   of Agrigentum was called "Checker of Winds." Accordingly it is said,
   that when, on a time, a wind blew from the mountain of Agrigentum,
   heavy and pestiferous for the inhabitants, and the cause also of
   barrenness to their wives, he made the wind to cease. Wherefore he
   himself writes in the lines:--


   "Thou shalt the might of the unwearied winds make still,

   Which rushing to the earth spoil mortals' crops,

   And at thy will bring back the avenging blasts."

   And they say that he was followed by some that used divinations, and
   some that had been long vexed by sore diseases. [3241] They plainly,
   then, believed in the performance of cures, and signs and wonders, from
   our Scriptures. For if certain powers move the winds and dispense
   showers, let them hear the psalmist: "How amiable are thy tabernacles,
   O Lord of hosts!" [3242] This is the Lord of powers, and
   principalities, and authorities, of whom Moses speaks; so that we may
   be with Him. "And ye shall circumcise your hard heart, and shall not
   harden your neck any more. For He is Lord of lords and God of gods, the
   great God and strong," [3243] and so forth. And Isaiah says, "Lift your
   eyes to the height, and see who hath produced all these things." [3244]

   And some say that plagues, and hail-storms, and tempests, and the like,
   are wont to take place, not alone in consequence of material
   disturbance, but also through anger of demons and bad angels. For
   instance, they say that the Magi at Cleone, watching the phenomena of
   the skies, when the clouds are about to discharge hail, avert the
   threatening of wrath by incantations and sacrifices. And if at any time
   there is the want of an animal, they are satisfied with bleeding their
   own finger for a sacrifice. The prophetess Diotima, by the Athenians
   offering sacrifice previous to the pestilence, effected a delay of the
   plague for ten years. The sacrifices, too, of Epimenides of Crete, put
   off the Persian war for an equal period. And it is considered to be all
   the same whether we call these spirits gods or angels. And those
   skilled in the matter of consecrating statues, in many of the temples
   have erected tombs of the dead, calling the souls of these Dæmons, and
   teaching them to be worshipped by men; as having, in consequence of the
   purity of their life, by the divine foreknowledge, received the power
   of wandering about the space around the earth in order to minister to
   men. For they knew that some souls were by nature kept in the body. But
   of these, as the work proceeds, in the treatise on the angels, we shall
   discourse.

   Democritus, who predicted many things from observation of celestial
   phenomena, was called "Wisdom" (Sophia). On his meeting a cordial
   reception from his brother Damasus, he predicted that there would be
   much rain, judging from certain stars. Some, accordingly, convinced by
   him, gathered their crops; for being in summer-time, they were still on
   the threshing-floor. But others lost all, unexpected and heavy showers
   having burst down.

   How then shall the Greeks any longer disbelieve the divine appearance
   on Mount Sinai, when the fire burned, consuming none of the things that
   grew on the mount; and the sound of trumpets issued forth, breathed
   without instruments? For that which is called the descent on the mount
   of God is the advent of divine power, pervading the whole world, and
   proclaiming "the light that is inaccessible." [3245]

   For such is the allegory, according to the Scripture. But the fire was
   seen, as Aristobulus [3246] says, while the whole multitude, amounting
   to not less than a million, besides those under age, were congregated
   around the mountain, the circuit of the mount not being less than five
   days' journey. Over the whole place of the vision the burning fire was
   seen by them all encamped as it were around; so that the descent was
   not local. For God is everywhere.

   Now the compilers of narratives say that in the island of Britain
   [3247] there is a cave situated under a mountain, and a chasm on its
   summit; and that, accordingly, when the wind falls into the cave, and
   rushes into the bosom of the cleft, a sound is heard like cymbals
   clashing musically. And often in the woods, when the leaves are moved
   by a sudden gust of wind, a sound is emitted like the song of birds.

   Those also who composed the Persics relate that in the uplands, in the
   country of the Magi, three mountains are situated on an extended plain,
   and that those who travel through the locality, on coming to the first
   mountain, hear a confused sound as of several myriads shouting, as if
   in battle array; and on reaching the middle one, they hear a clamour
   louder and more distinct; and at the end hear people singing a pæan, as
   if victorious. And the cause, in my opinion, of the whole sound, is the
   smoothness and cavernous character of the localities; and the air,
   entering in, being sent back and going to the same point, sounds with
   considerable force. Let these things be so. But it is possible for God
   Almighty, [3248] even without a medium, to produce a voice and vision
   through the ear, showing that His greatness has a natural order beyond
   what is customary, in order to the conversion of the hitherto
   unbelieving soul, and the reception of the commandment given. But there
   being a cloud and a lofty mountain, how is it not possible to hear a
   different sound, the wind moving by the active cause? Wherefore also
   the prophet says, "Ye heard the voice of words, and saw no similitude."
   [3249] You see how the Lord's voice, the Word, without shape, the power
   of the Word, the luminous word of the Lord, the truth from heaven, from
   above, coming to the assembly of the Church, wrought by the luminous
   immediate ministry.

      Chapter IV.--The Greeks Drew Many of Their Philosophical Tenets from the
      Egyptian and Indian Gymnosophists.

   We shall find another testimony in confirmation, in the fact that the
   best of the philosophers, having appropriated their most excellent
   dogmas from us, boast, as it were, of certain of the tenets which
   pertain to each sect being culled from other Barbarians, chiefly from
   the Egyptians--both other tenets, and that especially of the
   transmigration of the soul. For the Egyptians pursue a philosophy of
   their own. This is principally shown by their sacred ceremonial. For
   first advances the Singer, bearing some one of the symbols of music.
   For they say that he must learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of
   which contains the hymns of the gods, the second the regulations for
   the king's life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer, [3250]
   with a horologe in his hand, and a palm, the symbols of astrology. He
   must have the astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number,
   always in his mouth. Of these, one is about the order of the fixed
   stars that are visible, and another about the conjunctions and luminous
   appearances of the sun and moon; and the rest respecting their risings.
   Next in order advances the sacred Scribe, with wings on his head, and
   in his hand a book and rule, in which were writing ink and the reed,
   with which they write. And he must be acquainted with what are called
   hieroglyphics, and know about cosmography and geography, the position
   of the sun and moon, and about the five planets; also the description
   of Egypt, and the chart of the Nile; and the description of the
   equipment of the priests and of the places consecrated to them, and
   about the measures and the things in use in the sacred rites. Then the
   Stole-keeper follows those previously mentioned, with the cubit of
   justice and the cup for libations. He is acquainted with all points
   called Pædeutic (relating to training) and Moschophatic (sacrificial).
   There are also ten books which relate to the honour paid by them to
   their gods, and containing the Egyptian worship; as that relating to
   sacrifices, first-fruits, hymns, prayers, processions, festivals, and
   the like. And behind all walks the Prophet, with the water-vase carried
   openly in his arms; who is followed by those who carry the issue of
   loaves. He, as being the governor of the temple, learns the ten books
   called "Hieratic;" and they contain all about the laws, and the gods,
   and the whole of the training of the priests. For the Prophet is, among
   the Egyptians, also over the distribution of the revenues. There are
   then forty-two books of Hermes indispensably necessary; of which the
   six-and-thirty containing the whole philosophy of the Egyptians are
   learned by the forementioned personages; and the other six, which are
   medical, by the Pastophoroi (image-bearers),--treating of the structure
   of the body, and of diseases, and instruments, and medicines, and about
   the eyes, and the last about women. [3251] Such are the customs of the
   Egyptians, to speak briefly.

   The philosophy of the Indians, too, has been celebrated. Alexander of
   Macedon, having taken ten of the Indian Gymnosophists, that seemed the
   best and most sententious, proposed to them problems, threatening to
   put to death him that did not answer to the purpose; ordering one, who
   was the eldest of them, to decide.

   The first, then, being asked whether he thought that the living were
   more in number than the dead, said, The living; for that the dead were
   not. The second, on being asked whether the sea or the land maintained
   larger beasts, said, The land; for the sea was part of it. And the
   third being asked which was the most cunning of animals? The one, which
   has not hitherto been known, man. And the fourth being interrogated,
   For what reason they had made Sabba, who was their prince, revolt,
   answered, Because they wished him to live well rather than die ill. And
   the fifth being asked, Whether he thought that day or night was first,
   said, One day. For puzzling questions must have puzzling answers. And
   the sixth being posed with the query, How shall one be loved most? By
   being most powerful; in order that he may not be timid. And the seventh
   being asked, How any one of men could become God? said, If he do what
   it is impossible for man to do. And the eighth being asked, Which is
   the stronger, life or death? said, Life, which bears such ills. And the
   ninth being interrogated, Up to what point it is good for a man to
   live? said, Till he does not think that to die is better than to live.
   And on Alexander ordering the tenth to say something, for he was judge,
   he said, "One spake worse than another." And on Alexander saying, Shall
   you not, then, die first, having given such a judgment? he said, And
   how, O king, wilt thou prove true, after saying that thou wouldest kill
   first the first man that answered very badly?

   And that the Greeks are called pilferers of all manner of writing, is,
   as I think, sufficiently demonstrated by abundant proofs. [3252]

      Chapter V.--The Greeks Had Some Knowledge of the True God.

   And that the men of highest repute among the Greeks knew God, not by
   positive knowledge, but by indirect expression, [3253] Peter says in
   the Preaching: "Know then that there is one God, who made the beginning
   of all things, and holds the power of the end; and is the Invisible,
   who sees all things; incapable of being contained, who contains all
   things; needing nothing, whom all things need, and by whom they are;
   incomprehensible, everlasting, unmade, who made all things by the Word
   of His power,' that is, according to the gnostic scripture, His Son."
   [3254]

   Then he adds: "Worship this God not as the Greeks,"--signifying
   plainly, that the excellent among the Greeks worshipped the same God as
   we, but that they had not learned by perfect knowledge that which was
   delivered by the Son. "Do not then worship," he did not say, the God
   whom the Greeks worship, but "as the Greeks,"--changing the manner of
   the worship of God, not announcing another God. What, then, the
   expression "not as the Greeks" means, Peter himself shall explain, as
   he adds: "Since they are carried away by ignorance, and know not God"
   (as we do, according to the perfect knowledge); "but giving shape to
   the things [3255] of which He gave them the power for use--stocks and
   stones, brass and iron, gold and silver--matter;--and setting up the
   things which are slaves for use and possession, worship them. [3256]
   And what God hath given to them for food--the fowls of the air, and the
   fish of the sea, and the creeping things of the earth, and the wild
   beasts with the four-footed cattle of the field, weasels and mice, cats
   and dogs and apes, and their own proper food--they sacrifice as
   sacrifices to mortals; and offering dead things to the dead, as to
   gods, are unthankful to God, denying His existence by these things."
   And that it is said, that we and the Greeks know the same God, though
   not in the same way, he will infer thus: "Neither worship as the Jews;
   for they, thinking that they only know God, do not know Him, adoring as
   they do angels and archangels, the month and the moon. And if the moon
   be not visible, they do not hold the Sabbath, which is called the
   first; [3257] nor do they hold the new moon, nor the feast of
   unleavened bread, nor the feast, nor the great day." [3258] Then he
   gives the finishing stroke to the question: "So that do ye also,
   learning holily and righteously what we deliver to you; keep them,
   worshipping God in a new way, by Christ." For we find in the
   Scriptures, as the Lord says: "Behold, I make with you a new covenant,
   not as I made with your fathers in Mount Horeb." [3259] He made a new
   covenant with us; for what belonged to the Greeks and Jews is old. But
   we, who worship Him in a new way, in the third form, are Christians.
   For clearly, as I think, he showed that the one and only God was known
   by the Greeks in a Gentile way, by the Jews Judaically, and in a new
   and spiritual way by us.

   And further, that the same God that furnished both the Covenants was
   the giver of Greek philosophy to the Greeks, by which the Almighty is
   glorified among the Greeks, he shows. And it is clear from this.
   Accordingly, then, from the Hellenic training, and also from that of
   the law are gathered into the one race of the saved people those who
   accept faith: not that the three peoples are separated by time, so that
   one might suppose three natures, but trained in different Covenants of
   the one Lord, by the word of the one Lord. For that, as God wished to
   save the Jews by giving to them prophets, so also by raising up
   prophets of their own in their own tongue, as they were able to receive
   God's beneficence, He distinguished the most excellent of the Greeks
   from the common herd, in addition to "Peter's Preaching," the Apostle
   Paul will show, saying: "Take also the Hellenic books, read the Sibyl,
   how it is shown that God is one, and how the future is indicated. And
   taking Hystaspes, read, and you will find much more luminously and
   distinctly the Son of God described, and how many kings shall draw up
   their forces against Christ, hating Him and those that bear His name,
   and His faithful ones, and His patience, and His coming." Then in one
   word he asks us, "Whose is the world, and all that is in the world? Are
   they not God's?" [3260] Wherefore Peter says, that the Lord said to the
   apostles: "If any one of Israel then, wishes to repent, and by my name
   to believe in God, his sins shall be forgiven him, after twelve years.
   Go forth into the world, that no one may say, We have not heard."

      Chapter VI.--The Gospel Was Preached to Jews and Gentiles in Hades. [3261]

   But as the proclamation [of the Gospel] has come now at the fit time,
   so also at the fit time were the Law and the Prophets given to the
   Barbarians, and Philosophy to the Greeks, to fit their ears for the
   Gospel. "Therefore," says the Lord who delivered Israel, "in an
   acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I
   helped thee. And I have given thee for a Covenant to the nations; that
   thou mightest inhabit the earth, and receive the inheritance of the
   wilderness; saying to those that are in bonds, Come forth; and to those
   that are in darkness, Show yourselves." For if the "prisoners" are the
   Jews, of whom the Lord said, "Come forth, ye that will, from your
   bonds,"--meaning the voluntary bound, and who have taken on them "the
   burdens grievous to be borne" [3262] by human injunction--it is plain
   that "those in darkness" are they who have the ruling faculty of the
   soul buried in idolatry.

   For to those who were righteous according to the law, faith was
   wanting. Wherefore also the Lord, in healing them, said, "Thy faith
   hath saved thee." [3263] But to those that were righteous according to
   philosophy, not only faith in the Lord, but also the abandonment of
   idolatry, were necessary. Straightway, on the revelation of the truth,
   they also repented of their previous conduct.

   Wherefore the Lord preached the Gospel to those in Hades. Accordingly
   the Scripture says, "Hades says to Destruction, We have not seen His
   form, but we have heard His voice." [3264] It is not plainly the place,
   which, the words above say, heard the voice, but those who have been
   put in Hades, and have abandoned themselves to destruction, as persons
   who have thrown themselves voluntarily from a ship into the sea. They,
   then, are those that hear the divine power and voice. For who in his
   senses can suppose the souls of the righteous and those of sinners in
   the same condemnation, charging Providence with injustice?

   But how? Do not [the Scriptures] show that the Lord preached [3265] the
   Gospel to those that perished in the flood, or rather had been chained,
   and to those kept "in ward and guard"? [3266] And it has been shown
   also, [3267] in the second book of the Stromata, that the apostles,
   following the Lord, preached the Gospel to those in Hades. For it was
   requisite, in my opinion, that as here, so also there, the best of the
   disciples should be imitators of the Master; so that He should bring to
   repentance those belonging to the Hebrews, and they the Gentiles; that
   is, those who had lived in righteousness according to the Law and
   Philosophy, who had ended life not perfectly, but sinfully. For it was
   suitable to the divine administration, that those possessed of greater
   worth in righteousness, and whose life had been pre-eminent, on
   repenting of their transgressions, though found in another place, yet
   being confessedly of the number of the people of God Almighty, should
   be saved, each one according to his individual knowledge.

   And, as I think, the Saviour also exerts His might because it is His
   work to save; which accordingly He also did by drawing to salvation
   those who became willing, by the preaching [of the Gospel], to believe
   on Him, wherever they were. If, then, the Lord descended to Hades for
   no other end but to preach the Gospel, as He did descend; it was either
   to preach the Gospel to all or to the Hebrews only. If, accordingly, to
   all, then all who believe shall be saved, although they may be of the
   Gentiles, on making their profession there; since God's punishments are
   saving and disciplinary, leading to conversion, and choosing rather the
   repentance them the death of a sinner; [3268] and especially since
   souls, although darkened by passions, when released from their bodies,
   are able to perceive more clearly, because of their being no longer
   obstructed by the paltry flesh.

   If, then, He preached only to the Jews, who wanted the knowledge and
   faith of the Saviour, it is plain that, since God is no respecter of
   persons, the apostles also, as here, so there preached the Gospel to
   those of the heathen who were ready for conversion. And it is well said
   by the Shepherd, "They went down with them therefore into the water,
   and again ascended. But these descended alive, and again ascended
   alive. But those who had fallen asleep, descended dead, but ascended
   alive." [3269] Further the Gospel [3270] says, "that many bodies of
   those that slept arose,"--plainly as having been translated to a better
   state. [3271] There took place, then, a universal movement and
   translation through the economy of the Saviour. [3272]

   One righteous man, then, differs not, as righteous, from another
   righteous man, whether he be of the Law or a Greek. For God is not only
   Lord of the Jews, but of all men, and more nearly the Father of those
   who know Him. For if to live well and according to the law is to live,
   also to live rationally according to the law is to live; and those who
   lived rightly before the Law were classed under faith, [3273] and
   judged to be righteous,--it is evident that those, too, who were
   outside of the Law, having lived rightly, in consequence of the
   peculiar nature of the voice, [3274] though they are in Hades and in
   ward, [3275] on hearing the voice of the Lord, whether that of His own
   person or that acting through His apostles, with all speed turned and
   believed. For we remember that the Lord is "the power of God," [3276]
   and power can never be weak.

   So I think it is demonstrated that the God being good, and the Lord
   powerful, they save with a righteousness and equality which extend to
   all that turn to Him, whether here or elsewhere. For it is not here
   alone that the active power of God is beforehand, but it is everywhere
   and is always at work. Accordingly, in the Preaching of Peter, the Lord
   says to the disciples after the resurrection, "I have chosen you twelve
   disciples, judging you worthy of me," whom the Lord wished to be
   apostles, having judged them faithful, sending them into the world to
   the men on the earth, that they may know that there is one God, showing
   clearly what would take place by the faith of Christ; that they who
   heard and believed should be saved; and that those who believed not,
   after having heard, should bear witness, not having the excuse to
   allege, We have not heard.

   What then? Did not the same dispensation obtain in Hades, so that even
   there, all the souls, on hearing the proclamation, might either exhibit
   repentance, or confess that their punishment was just, because they
   believed not? And it were the exercise of no ordinary arbitrariness,
   for those who had departed before the advent of the Lord (not having
   the Gospel preached to them, and having afforded no ground from
   themselves, in consequence of believing or not) to obtain either
   salvation or punishment. For it is not right that these should be
   condemned without trial, and that those alone who lived after the
   advent should have the advantage of the divine righteousness. But to
   all rational souls it was said from above, "Whatever one of you has
   done in ignorance, without clearly knowing God, if, on becoming
   conscious, he repent, all his sins will be forgiven him." [3277] "For,
   behold," it is said, "I have set before your face death and life, that
   ye may choose life." [3278] God says that He set, not that He made
   both, in order to the comparison of choice. And in another Scripture He
   says, "If ye hear Me, and be willing, ye shall eat the good of the
   land. But if ye hear Me not, and are not willing, the sword shall
   devour you: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these things." [3279]

   Again, David expressly (or rather the Lord in the person of the saint,
   and the same from the foundation of the world is each one who at
   different periods is saved, and shall be saved by faith) says, "My
   heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced, and my flesh shall still rest
   in hope. For Thou shalt not leave my soul in hell, nor wilt Thou give
   Thine holy one to see corruption. Thou hast made known to me the paths
   of life, Thou wilt make me full of joy in Thy presence." [3280] As,
   then, the people was precious to the Lord, so also is the entire holy
   people; he also who is converted from the Gentiles, who was prophesied
   under the name of proselyte, along with the Jew. For rightly the
   Scripture says, that "the ox and the bear shall come together." [3281]
   For the Jew is designated by the ox, from the animal under the yoke
   being reckoned clean, according to the law; for the ox both parts the
   hoof and chews the cud. And the Gentile is designated by the bear,
   which is an unclean and wild beast. And this animal brings forth a
   shapeless lump of flesh, which it shapes into the likeness of a beast
   solely by its tongue. For he who is convened from among the Gentiles is
   formed from a beastlike life to gentleness by the word; and, when once
   tamed, is made clean, just as the ox. For example, the prophet says,
   "The sirens, and the daughters of the sparrows, and all the beasts of
   the field, shall bless me." [3282] Of the number of unclean animals,
   the wild beasts of the field are known to be, that is, of the world;
   since those who are wild in respect of faith, and polluted in life, and
   not purified by the righteousness which is according to the law, are
   called wild beasts. But changed from wild beasts by the faith of the
   Lord, they become men of God, advancing from the wish to change to the
   fact. For some the Lord exhorts, and to those who have already made the
   attempt he stretches forth His hand, and draws them up. "For the Lord
   dreads not the face of any one, nor will He regard greatness; for He
   hath made small and great, and cares alike for all." [3283] And David
   says, "For the heathen are fixed in the destruction they have caused;
   their foot is taken in the snare which they hid." [3284] "But the Lord
   was a refuge to the poor, a help in season also in affliction." [3285]
   Those, then, that were in affliction had the Gospel seasonably
   proclaimed. And therefore it said, "Declare among the heathen his
   pursuits," [3286] that they may not be judged unjustly.

   If, then, He preached the Gospel to those in the flesh that they might
   not be condemned unjustly, how is it conceivable that He did not for
   the same cause preach the Gospel to those who had departed this life
   before His advent? "For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: His
   countenance beholdeth uprightness." [3287] "But he that loveth
   wickedness hateth his own soul." [3288]

   If, then, in the deluge all sinful flesh perished, punishment having
   been inflicted on them for correction, we must first believe that the
   will of God, which is disciplinary and beneficent, [3289] saves those
   who turn to Him. Then, too, the more subtle substance, the soul, could
   never receive any injury from the grosser element of water, its subtle
   and simple nature rendering it impalpable, called as it is incorporeal.
   But whatever is gross, made so in consequence of sin, this is cast away
   along with the carnal spirit which lusts against the soul. [3290]

   Now also Valentinus, the Coryphæus of those who herald community, in
   his book on The Intercourse of Friends, writes in these words: "Many of
   the things that are written, though in common books, are found written
   in the church of God. For those sayings which proceed from the heart
   are vain. For the law written in the heart is the People [3291] of the
   Beloved--loved and loving Him." For whether it be the Jewish writings
   or those of the philosophers that he calls "the Common Books," he makes
   the truth common. And Isidore, [3292] at once son and disciple to
   Basilides, in the first book of the Expositions of the Prophet Parchor,
   writes also in these words: "The Attics say that certain things were
   intimated to Socrates, in consequence of a dæmon attending on him. And
   Aristotle says that all men are provided with dæmons, that attend on
   them during the time they are in the body,--having taken this piece of
   prophetic instruction and transferred it to his own books, without
   acknowledging whence he had abstracted this statement." And again, in
   the second book of his work, he thus writes: "And let no one think that
   what we say is peculiar to the elect, was said before by any
   philosophers. For it is not a discovery of theirs. For having
   appropriated it from our prophets, they attributed it to him who is
   wise according to them." Again, in the same: "For to me it appears that
   those who profess to philosophize, do so that they may learn what is
   the winged oak, [3293] and the variegated robe on it, all of which
   Pherecydes has employed as theological allegories, having taken them
   from the prophecy of Cham."

      Chapter VII.--What True Philosophy Is, and Whence So Called.

   As we have long ago pointed out, what we propose as our subject is not
   the discipline which obtains in each sect, but that which is really
   philosophy, strictly systematic Wisdom, which furnishes acquaintance
   with the things which pertain to life. And we define Wisdom to be
   certain knowledge, being a sure and irrefragable apprehension of things
   divine and human, comprehending the present, past, and future, which
   the Lord hath taught us, both by His advent and by the prophets. And it
   is irrefragable by reason, inasmuch as it has been communicated. And so
   it is wholly true according to [God's] intention, as being known
   through means of the Son. And in one aspect it is eternal, and in
   another it becomes useful in time. Partly it is one and the same,
   partly many and indifferent--partly without any movement of passion,
   partly with passionate desire--partly perfect, partly incomplete.

   This wisdom, then--rectitude of soul and of reason, and purity of
   life--is the object of the desire of philosophy, which is kindly and
   lovingly disposed towards wisdom, and does everything to attain it.

   Now those are called philosophers, among us, who love Wisdom, the
   Creator and Teacher of all things, that is, the knowledge of the Son of
   God; and among the Greeks, those who undertake arguments on virtue.
   Philosophy, then, consists of such dogmas found in each sect (I mean
   those of philosophy) as cannot be impugned, with a corresponding life,
   collected into one selection; and these, stolen from the Barbarian
   God-given grace, have been adorned by Greek speech. For some they have
   borrowed, and others they have misunderstood. And in the case of
   others, what they have spoken, in consequence of being moved, they have
   not yet perfectly worked out; and others by human conjecture and
   reasoning, in which also they stumble. And they think that they have
   hit the truth perfectly; but as we understand them, only partially.
   They know, then, nothing more than this world. And it is just like
   geometry, which treats of measures and magnitudes and forms, by
   delineation on plane-surfaces; and just as painting appears to take in
   the whole field of view in the scenes represented. But it gives a false
   description of the view, according to the rules of the art, employing
   the signs that result from the incidents of the lines of vision. By
   this means, the higher and lower points in the view, and those between,
   are preserved; and some objects seem to appear in the foreground, and
   others in the background, and others to appear in some other way, on
   the smooth and level surface. So also the philosophers copy the truth,
   after the manner of painting. And always in the case of each one of
   them, their self-love is the cause of all their mistakes. Wherefore one
   ought not, in the desire for the glory that terminates in men, to be
   animated by self-love; but loving God, to become really holy with
   wisdom. If, then, one treats what is particular as universal, and
   regards that, which serves, as the Lord, he misses the truth, not
   understanding what was spoken by David by way of confession: "I have
   eaten earth [ashes] like bread." [3294] Now, self-love and self-conceit
   are, in his view, earth and error. But if so, science and knowledge are
   derived from instruction. And if there is instruction, you must seek
   for the master. Cleanthes claims Zeno, and Metrodorus Epicurus, and
   Theophrastus Aristotle, and Plato Socrates. But if I come to
   Pythagoras, and Pherecydes, and Thales, and the first wise men, I come
   to a stand in my search for their teacher. Should you say the
   Egyptians, the Indians, the Babylonians, and the Magi themselves, I
   will not stop from asking their teacher. And I lead you up to the first
   generation of men; and from that point I begin to investigate Who is
   their teacher. No one of men; for they had not yet learned. Nor yet any
   of the angels: for in the way that angels, in virtue of being angels,
   speak, men do not hear; nor, as we have ears, have they a tongue to
   correspond; nor would any one attribute to the angels organs of speech,
   lips I mean, and the parts contiguous, throat, and windpipe, and chest,
   breath and air to vibrate. And God is far from calling aloud in the
   unapproachable sanctity, separated as He is from even the archangels.

   And we also have already heard that angels learned the truth, and their
   rulers over them; [3295] for they had a beginning. It remains, then,
   for us, ascending to seek their teacher. And since the unoriginated
   Being is one, the Omnipotent God; one, too, is the First-begotten, "by
   whom all things were made, and without whom not one thing ever was
   made." [3296] "For one, in truth, is God, who formed the beginning of
   all things;" pointing out "the first-begotten Son," Peter writes,
   accurately comprehending the statement, "In the beginning God made the
   heaven and the earth." [3297] And He is called Wisdom by all the
   prophets. This is He who is the Teacher of all created beings, the
   Fellow-counsellor of God, who foreknew all things; and He from above,
   from the first foundation of the world, "in many ways and many times,"
   [3298] trains and perfects; whence it is rightly said, "Call no man
   your teacher on earth." [3299]

   You see whence the true philosophy has its handles; though the Law be
   the image and shadow of the truth: for the Law is the shadow of the
   truth. But the self-love of the Greeks proclaims certain men as their
   teachers. As, then, the whole family runs back to God the Creator;
   [3300] so also all the teaching of good things, which justifies, does
   to the Lord, and leads and contributes to this.

   But if from any creature they received in any way whatever the seeds of
   the Truth, they did not nourish them; but committing them to a barren
   and rainless soil, they choked them with weeds, as the Pharisees
   revolted from the Law, by introducing human teachings,--the cause of
   these being not the Teacher, but those who choose to disobey. But those
   of them who believed the Lord's advent and the plain teaching of the
   Scriptures, attain to the knowledge of the law; as also those addicted
   to philosophy, by the teaching of the Lord, are introduced into the
   knowledge of the true philosophy: "For the oracles of the Lord are pure
   oracles, melted in the fire, tried in the earth, [3301] purified seven
   times." [3302] Just as silver often purified, so is the just man
   brought to the test, becoming the Lord's coin and receiving the royal
   image. Or, since Solomon also calls the "tongue of the righteous man
   gold that has been subjected to fire," [3303] intimating that the
   doctrine which has been proved, and is wise, is to be praised and
   received, whenever it is amply tried by the earth: that is, when the
   gnostic soul is in manifold ways sanctified, through withdrawal from
   earthy fires. And the body in which it dwells is purified, being
   appropriated to the pureness of a holy temple. But the first
   purification which takes place in the body, the soul being first, is
   abstinence from evil things, which some consider perfection, and is, in
   truth, the perfection of the common believer--Jew and Greek. But in the
   case of the Gnostic, after that which is reckoned perfection in others,
   his righteousness advances to activity in well-doing. And in whomsoever
   the increased force [3304] of righteousness advances to the doing of
   good, in his case perfection abides in the fixed habit of well-doing
   after the likeness of God. For those who are the seed of Abraham, and
   besides servants of God, are "the called;" and the sons of Jacob are
   the elect--they who have tripped up the energy of wickedness.

   If; then, we assert that Christ Himself is Wisdom, and that it was His
   working which showed itself in the prophets, by which the gnostic
   tradition may be learned, as He Himself taught the apostles during His
   presence; then it follows that the gnosis, which is the knowledge and
   apprehension of things present, future, and past, which is sure and
   reliable, as being imparted and revealed by the Son of God, is wisdom.

   And if, too, the end of the wise man is contemplation, that of those
   who are still philosophers aims at it, but never attains it, unless by
   the process of learning it receives the prophetic utterance which has
   been made known, by which it grasps both the present, the future, and
   the past--how they are, were, and shall be.

   And the gnosis itself is that which has descended by transmission to a
   few, having been imparted unwritten by the apostles. Hence, then,
   knowledge or wisdom ought to be exercised up to the eternal and
   unchangeable habit of contemplation.

      Chapter VIII.--Philosophy is Knowledge Given by God.

   For Paul too, in the Epistles, plainly does not disparage philosophy;
   but deems it unworthy of the man who has attained to the elevation of
   the Gnostic, any more to go back to the Hellenic "philosophy,"
   figuratively calling it "the rudiments of this world," [3305] as being
   most rudimentary, and a preparatory training for the truth. Wherefore
   also, writing to the Hebrews, who were declining again from faith to
   the law, he says, "Have ye not need again of one to teach you which are
   the first principles of the oracles of God, and are become such as have
   need of milk, and not of strong meat?" [3306] So also to the
   Colossians, who were Greek converts, "Beware lest any man spoil you by
   philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the
   rudiments of this world, and not after Christ," [3307] --enticing them
   again to return to philosophy, the elementary doctrine.

   And should one say that it was through human understanding that
   philosophy was discovered by the Greeks, still I find the Scriptures
   saying that understanding is sent by God. The psalmist, accordingly,
   considers understanding as the greatest free gift, and beseeches,
   saying, "I am Thy servant; give me understanding." [3308] And does not
   David, while asking the abundant experience of knowledge, write, "Teach
   me gentleness, and discipline, and knowledge: for I have believed in
   Thy commandments?" [3309] He confessed the covenants to be of the
   highest authority, and that they were given to the more excellent.
   Accordingly the psalm again says of God, "He hath not done thus to any
   nation; and He hath not shown His judgments to them." [3310] The
   expression "He hath not done so" shows that He hath done, but not
   "thus." The "thus," then, is put comparatively, with reference to
   pre-eminence, which obtains in our case. The prophet might have said
   simply, "He hath not done," without the "thus."

   Further, Peter in the Acts says, "Of a truth, I perceive that God is no
   respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth Him, and
   worketh righteousness, is accepted by Him." [3311]

   The absence of respect of persons in God is not then in time, but from
   eternity. Nor had His beneficence a beginning; nor any more is it
   limited to places or persons. For His beneficence is not confined to
   parts. "Open ye the gates of righteousness," it is said; "entering into
   them, I will confess to the Lord. This is the gate of the Lord. The
   righteous shall enter by it." [3312] Explaining the prophet's saying,
   Barnabas adds, "There being many gates open, that which is in
   righteousness is the gate which is in Christ, by which all who enter
   are blessed." Bordering on the same meaning is also the following
   prophetic utterance: "The Lord is on many waters;" [3313] not the
   different covenants alone, but the modes of teaching, those among the
   Greek and those among the Barbarians, conducing to righteousness. And
   already clearly David, bearing testimony to the truth, sings, "Let
   sinners be turned into Hades, and all the nations that forget God."
   [3314] They forget, plainly, Him whom they formerly remembered, and
   dismiss Him whom they knew previous to forgetting Him. There was then a
   dim knowledge of God also among the nations. So much for those points.

   Now the Gnostic must be erudite. And since the Greeks say that
   Protagoras having led the way, the opposing of one argument by another
   was invented, it is fitting that something be said with reference to
   arguments of this sort. For Scripture says, "He that says much, shall
   also hear in his turn." [3315] And who shall understand a parable of
   the Lord, but the wise, the intelligent, and he that loves his Lord?
   Let such a man be faithful; let him be capable of uttering his
   knowledge; let him be wise in the discrimination of words; let him be
   dexterous in action; let him be pure. "The greater he seems to be, the
   more humble should he be," says Clement in the Epistle to the
   Corinthians,--"such an one as is capable of complying with the precept,
   And some pluck from the fire, and on others have compassion, making a
   difference,'" [3316]

   The pruning-hook is made, certainly, principally for pruning; but with
   it we separate twigs that have got intertwined, cut the thorns which
   grow along with the vines, which it is not very easy to reach. And all
   these things have a reference to pruning. Again, man is made
   principally for the knowledge of God; but he also measures land,
   practices agriculture, and philosophizes; of which pursuits, one
   conduces to life, another to living well, a third to the study of the
   things which are capable of demonstration. Further, let those who say
   that philosophy took its rise from the devil know this, that the
   Scripture says that "the devil is transformed into an angel of light."
   [3317] When about to do what? Plainly, when about to prophesy. But if
   he prophesies as an angel of light, he will speak what is true. And if
   he prophesies what is angelical, and of the light, then he prophesies
   what is beneficial when he is transformed according to the likeness of
   the operation, though he be different with respect to the matter of
   apostasy. For how could he deceive any one, without drawing the lover
   of knowledge into fellowship, and so drawing him afterwards into
   falsehood? Especially he will be found to know the truth, if not so as
   to comprehend it, yet so as not to be unacquainted with it.

   Philosophy is not then false, though the thief and the liar speak
   truth, through a transformation of operation. Nor is sentence of
   condemnation to be pronounced ignorantly against what is said, on
   account of him who says it (which also is to be kept in view, in the
   case of those who are now alleged to prophesy); but what is said must
   be looked at, to see if it keep by the truth.

   And in general terms, we shall not err in alleging that all things
   necessary and profitable for life came to us from God, and that
   philosophy more especially was given to the Greeks, as a covenant
   peculiar to them--being, as it is, a stepping-stone to the philosophy
   which is according to Christ--although those who applied themselves to
   the philosophy of the Greeks shut their ears voluntarily to the truth,
   despising the voice of Barbarians, or also dreading the danger
   suspended over the believer, by the laws of the state.

   And as in the Barbarian philosophy, so also in the Hellenic, "tares
   were sown" by the proper husbandman of the tares; whence also heresies
   grew up among us along with the productive wheat; and those who in the
   Hellenic philosophy preach the impiety and voluptuousness of Epicurus,
   and whatever other tenets are disseminated contrary to right reason,
   exist among the Greeks as spurious fruits of the divinely bestowed
   husbandry. This voluptuous and selfish philosophy the apostle calls
   "the wisdom of this world;" in consequence of its teaching the things
   of this world and about it alone, and its consequent subjection, as far
   as respects ascendancy, to those who rule here. Wherefore also this
   fragmentary philosophy is very elementary, while truly perfect science
   deals with intellectual objects, which are beyond the sphere of the
   world, and with the objects still more spiritual than those which "eye
   saw not, and ear heard not, nor did it enter into the heart of men,"
   till the Teacher told the account of them to us; unveiling the holy of
   holies; and in ascending order, things still holier than these, to
   those who are truly and not spuriously heirs of the Lord's adoption.
   For we now dare aver (for here is the faith that is characterized by
   knowledge [3318] ) that such an one knows all things, and comprehends
   all things in the exercise of sure apprehension, respecting matters
   difficult for us, and really pertaining to the true gnosis [3319] such
   as were James, Peter, John, Paul, and the rest of the apostles. For
   prophecy is full of knowledge (gnosis), inasmuch as it was given by the
   Lord, and again explained by the Lord to the apostles. And is not
   knowledge (gnosis) an attribute of the rational soul, which trains
   itself for this, that by knowledge it may become entitled to
   immortality? For both are powers of the soul, both knowledge and
   impulse. And impulse is found to be a movement after an assent. For he
   who has an impulse towards an action, first receives the knowledge of
   the action, and secondly the impulse. Let us further devote our
   attention to this. For since learning is older than action; (for
   naturally, he who does what he wishes to do learns it first; and
   knowledge comes from learning, and impulse follows knowledge; after
   which comes action;) knowledge turns out the beginning and author of
   all rational action. So that rightly the peculiar nature of the
   rational soul is characterized by this alone; for in reality impulse,
   like knowledge, is excited by existing objects. And knowledge (gnosis)
   is essentially a contemplation of existences on the part of the soul,
   either of a certain thing or of certain things, and when perfected, of
   all together. Although some say that the wise man is persuaded that
   there are some things incomprehensible, in such wise as to have
   respecting them a kind of comprehension, inasmuch as he comprehends
   that things incomprehensible are incomprehensible; which is common, and
   pertains to those who are capable of perceiving little. For such a man
   affirms that there are some things incomprehensible.

   But that Gnostic of whom I speak, himself comprehends what seems to be
   incomprehensible to others; believing that nothing is incomprehensible
   to the Son of God, whence nothing incapable of being taught. For He who
   suffered out of His love for us, would have suppressed no element of
   knowledge requisite for our instruction. Accordingly this faith becomes
   sure demonstration; since truth follows what has been delivered by God.
   But if one desires extensive knowledge, "he knows things ancient, and
   conjectures things future; he understands knotty sayings, and the
   solutions of enigmas. The disciple of wisdom foreknows signs and omens,
   and the issues of seasons and of times." [3320]

      Chapter IX.--The Gnostic Free of All Perturbations of the Soul.

   The Gnostic is such, that he is subject only to the affections that
   exist for the maintenance of the body, such as hunger, thirst, and the
   like. But in the case of the Saviour, it were ludicrous [to suppose]
   that the body, as a body, demanded the necessary aids in order to its
   duration. For He ate, not for the sake of the body, which was kept
   together by a holy energy, but in order that it might not enter into
   the minds of those who were with Him to entertain a different opinion
   of Him; in like manner as certainly some afterwards supposed that He
   appeared in a phantasmal shape (dokesei). But He was entirely
   impassible (apathes); inaccessible to any movement of feeling--either
   pleasure or pain. While the apostles, having most gnostically mastered,
   through the Lord's teaching, anger and fear, and lust, were not liable
   even to such of the movements of feeling, as seem good, courage, zeal,
   joy, desire, through a steady condition of mind, not changing a whit;
   but ever continuing unvarying in a state of training after the
   resurrection of the Lord.

   And should it be granted that the affections specified above, when
   produced rationally, are good, yet they are nevertheless inadmissible
   in the case of the perfect man, who is incapable of exercising courage:
   for neither does he meet what inspires fear, as he regards none of the
   things that occur in life as to be dreaded; nor can aught dislodge him
   from this--the love he has towards God. Nor does he need cheerfulness
   of mind; for he does not fall into pain, being persuaded that all
   things happen well. Nor is he angry; for there is nothing to move him
   to anger, seeing he ever loves God, and is entirely turned towards Him
   alone, and therefore hates none of God's creatures. No more does he
   envy; for nothing is wanting to him, that is requisite to assimilation,
   in order that he may be excellent and good. Nor does he consequently
   love any one with this common affection, but loves the Creator in the
   creatures. Nor, consequently, does he fall into any desire and
   eagerness; nor does he want, as far as respects his soul, aught
   appertaining to others, now that he associates through love with the
   Beloved One, to whom he is allied by free choice, and by the habit
   which results from training, approaches closer to Him, and is blessed
   through the abundance of good things.

   So that on these accounts he is compelled to become like his Teacher in
   impassibility. For the Word of God is intellectual, according as the
   image of mind is seen [3321] in man alone. Thus also the good man is
   godlike in form and semblance as respects his soul. And, on the other
   hand, God is like man. For the distinctive form of each one is the mind
   by which we are characterized. Consequently, also, those who sin
   against man are unholy and impious. For it were ridiculous to say that
   the gnostic and perfect man must not eradicate anger and courage,
   inasmuch as without these he will not struggle against circumstances,
   or abide what is terrible. But if we take from him desire, he will be
   quite overwhelmed by troubles, and therefore depart from this life very
   basely. Unless possessed of it, as some suppose, he will not conceive a
   desire for what is like the excellent and the good. If, then, all
   alliance with what is good is accompanied with desire, how, it is said,
   does he remain impassible who desires what is excellent?

   But these people know not, as appears, the divinity of love. For love
   is not desire on the part of him who loves; but is a relation of
   affection, restoring the Gnostic to the unity of the
   faith,--independent of time and place. But he who by love is already in
   the midst of that in which he is destined to be, and has anticipated
   hope by knowledge, does not desire anything, having, as far as
   possible, the very thing desired. Accordingly, as to be expected, he
   continues in the exercise of gnostic love, in the one unvarying state.

   Nor will he, therefore, eagerly desire to be assimilated to what is
   beautiful, possessing, as he does, beauty by love. What more need of
   courage and of desire to him, who has obtained the affinity to the
   impassible God which arises from love, and by love has enrolled himself
   among the friends of God?

   We must therefore rescue the gnostic and perfect man from all passion
   of the soul. For knowledge (gnosis) produces practice, and practice
   habit or disposition; and such a state as this produces impassibility,
   not moderation of passion. And the complete eradication of desire reaps
   as its fruit impassibility. But the Gnostic does not share either in
   those affections that are commonly celebrated as good, that is, the
   good things of the affections which are allied to the passions: such, I
   mean, as gladness, which is allied to pleasure; and dejection, for this
   is conjoined with pain; and caution, for it is subject to fear. Nor yet
   does he share in high spirit, for it takes its place alongside of
   wrath; although some say that these are no longer evil, but already
   good. For it is impossible that he who has been once made perfect by
   love, and feasts eternally and insatiably on the boundless joy of
   contemplation, should delight in small and grovelling things. For what
   rational cause remains any more to the man who has gained "the light
   inaccessible," [3322] for revering to the good things of the world?
   Although not yet true as to time and place, yet by that gnostic love
   through which the inheritance and perfect restitution follow, the giver
   of the reward makes good by deeds what the Gnostic, by gnostic choice,
   had grasped by anticipation through love.

   For by going away to the Lord, for the love he bears Him, though his
   tabernacle be visible on earth, he does not withdraw himself from life.
   For that is not permitted to him. But he has withdrawn his soul from
   the passions. For that is granted to him. And on the other hand he
   lives, having put to death his lusts, and no longer makes use of the
   body, but allows it the use of necessaries, that he may not give cause
   for dissolution.

   How, then, has he any more need of fortitude, who is not in the midst
   of dangers, being not present, but already wholly with the object of
   love? And what necessity for self-restraint to him who has not need of
   it? For to have such desires, as require self-restraint in order to
   their control, is characteristic of one who is not yet pure, but
   subject to passion. Now, fortitude is assumed by reason of fear and
   cowardice. For it were no longer seemly that the friend of God, whom
   "God hath fore-ordained before the foundation of the world" [3323] to
   be enrolled in the highest "adoption," should fall into pleasures or
   fears, and be occupied in the repression of the passions. For I venture
   to assert, that as he is predestinated through what he shall do, and
   what he shall obtain, so also has he predestinated himself by reason of
   what he knew and whom he loved; not having the future indistinct, as
   the multitude live, conjecturing it, but having grasped by gnostic
   faith what is hidden from others. And through love, the future is for
   him already present. For he has believed, through prophecy and the
   advent, on God who lies not. And what he believes he possesses, and
   keeps hold of the promise. And He who hath promised is truth. And
   through the trustworthiness of Him who has promised, he has firmly laid
   hold of the end of the promise by knowledge. And he, who knows the sure
   comprehension of the future which there is in the circumstances, in
   which he is placed, by love goes to meet the future. So he, that is
   persuaded that he will obtain the things that are really good, will not
   pray to obtain what is here, but that he may always cling to the faith
   which hits the mark and succeeds. And besides, he will pray that as
   many as possible may become like him, to the glory of God, which is
   perfected through knowledge. For he who is made like the Saviour is
   also devoted to saving; performing unerringly the commandments as far
   as the human nature may admit of the image. And this is to worship God
   by deeds and knowledge of the true righteousness. The Lord will not
   wait for the voice of this man in prayer. "Ask," He says, "and I will
   do it; think, and I will give." [3324]

   For, in fine, it is impossible that the immutable should assume
   firmness and consistency in the mutable. But the ruling faculty being
   in perpetual change, and therefore unstable, the force of habit is not
   maintained. For how can he who is perpetually changed by external
   occurrences and accidents, ever possess habit and disposition, and in a
   word, grasp of scientific knowledge (episteme)? Further, also, the
   philosophers regard the virtues as habits, dispositions, and sciences.
   And as knowledge (gnosis) is not born with men, but is acquired, [3325]
   and the acquiring of it in its elements demands application, and
   training, and progress; and then from incessant practice it passes into
   a habit; so, when perfected in the mystic habit, it abides, being
   infallible through love. For not only has he apprehended the first
   Cause, and the Cause produced by it, and is sure about them, possessing
   firmly firm and irrefragable and immoveable reasons; but also
   respecting what is good and what is evil, and respecting all
   production, and to speak comprehensively, respecting all about which
   the Lord has spoken, he has learned, from the truth itself, the most
   exact truth from the foundation of the world to the end. Not preferring
   to the truth itself what appears plausible, or, according to Hellenic
   reasoning, necessary; but what has been spoken by the Lord he accepts
   as clear and evident, though concealed from others; and he has already
   received the knowledge of all things. And the oracles we possess give
   their utterances respecting what exists, as it is; and respecting what
   is future, as it shall be; and respecting what is past, as it was.

   In scientific matters, as being alone possessed of scientific
   knowledge, he will hold the preeminence, and will discourse on the
   discussion respecting the good, ever intent on intellectual objects,
   tracing out his procedure in human affairs from the archetypes above;
   as navigators direct the ship according to the star; prepared to hold
   himself in readiness for every suitable action; accustomed to despise
   all difficulties and dangers when it is necessary to undergo them;
   never doing anything precipitate or incongruous either to himself or
   the common weal; foreseeing; and inflexible by pleasures both of waking
   hours and of dreams. For, accustomed to spare living and frugality, he
   is moderate, active, and grave; requiring few necessaries for life;
   occupying himself with nothing superfluous. But desiring not even these
   things as chief, but by reason of fellowship in life, as necessary for
   his sojourn in life, as far as necessary.

      Chapter X.--The Gnostic Avails Himself of the Help of All Human Knowledge.

   For to him knowledge (gnosis) is the principal thing. Consequently,
   therefore, he applies to the subjects that are a training for
   knowledge, taking from each branch of study its contribution to the
   truth. Prosecuting, then, the proportion of harmonies in music; and in
   arithmetic noting the increasing and decreasing of numbers, and their
   relations to one another, and how the most of things fall under some
   proportion of numbers; studying geometry, which is abstract essence, he
   perceives a continuous distance, and an immutable essence which is
   different from these bodies. And by astronomy, again, raised from the
   earth in his mind, he is elevated along with heaven, and will revolve
   with its revolution; studying ever divine things, and their harmony
   with each other; from which Abraham starting, ascended to the knowledge
   of Him who created them. Further, the Gnostic will avail himself of
   dialectics, fixing on the distinction of genera into species, and will
   master [3326] the distinction of existences, till he come to what are
   primary and simple.

   But the multitude are frightened at the Hellenic philosophy, as
   children are at masks, being afraid lest it lead them astray. But if
   the faith (for I cannot call it knowledge) which they possess be such
   as to be dissolved by plausible speech, let it be by all means
   dissolved, [3327] and let them confess that they will not retain the
   truth. For truth is immoveable; but false opinion dissolves. We choose,
   for instance, one purple by comparison with another purple. So that, if
   one confesses that he has not a heart that has been made right, he has
   not the table of the money-changers or the test of words. [3328] And
   how can he be any longer a money-changer, who is not able to prove and
   distinguish spurious coin, even offhand?

   Now David cried, "The righteous shall not be shaken for ever;" [3329]
   neither, consequently, by deceptive speech nor by erring pleasure.
   Whence he shall never be shaken from his own heritage. "He shall not be
   afraid of evil tidings;" [3330] consequently neither of unfounded
   calumny, nor of the false opinion around him. No more will he dread
   cunning words, who is capable of distinguishing them, or of answering
   rightly to questions asked. Such a bulwark are dialectics, that truth
   cannot be trampled under foot by the Sophists. "For it behoves those
   who praise in the holy name of the Lord," according to the prophet, "to
   rejoice in heart, seeking the Lord. Seek then Him, and be strong. Seek
   His face continually in every way." [3331] "For, having spoken at
   sundry times and in divers manners," [3332] it is not in one way only
   that He is known.

   It is, then, not by availing himself of these as virtues that our
   Gnostic will be deeply learned. But by using them as helps in
   distinguishing what is common and what is peculiar, he will admit the
   truth. For the cause of all error and false opinion, is inability to
   distinguish in what respect things are common, and in what respects
   they differ. For unless, in things that are distinct, one closely watch
   speech, he will inadvertently confound what is common and what is
   peculiar. And where this takes place, he must of necessity fall into
   pathless tracts and error.

   The distinction of names and things also in the Scriptures themselves
   produces great light in men's souls. For it is necessary to understand
   expressions which signify several things, and several expressions when
   they signify one thing. The result of which is accurate answering. But
   it is necessary to avoid the great futility which occupies itself in
   irrelevant matters; since the Gnostic avails himself of branches of
   learning as auxiliary preparatory exercises, in order to the accurate
   communication of the truth, as far as attainable and with as little
   distraction as possible, and for defence against reasonings that plot
   for the extinction of the truth. He will not then be deficient in what
   contributes to proficiency in the curriculum of studies and the
   Hellenic philosophy; but not principally, but necessarily, secondarily,
   and on account of circumstances. For what those labouring in heresies
   use wickedly, the Gnostic will use rightly.

   Therefore the truth that appears in the Hellenic philosophy, being
   partial, the real truth, like the sun glancing on the colours both
   white and black, shows what like each of them is. So also it exposes
   all sophistical plausibility. Rightly, then, was it proclaimed also by
   the Greeks:--"Truth the queen is the beginning of great virtue." [3333]

      Chapter XI.--The Mystical Meanings in the Proportions of Numbers,
      Geometrical Ratios, and Music.

   As then in astronomy we have Abraham as an instance, so also in
   arithmetic we have the same Abraham. "For, hearing that Lot was taken
   captive, and having numbered his own servants, born in his house, 318
   (tie [3334] )," he defeats a very great number of the enemy.

   They say, then, that the character representing 300 is, as to shape,
   the type of the Lord's sign, [3335] and that the Iota and the Eta
   indicate the Saviour's name; that it was indicated, accordingly, that
   Abraham's domestics were in salvation, who having fled to the Sign and
   the Name became lords of the captives, and of the very many unbelieving
   nations that followed them.

   Now the number 300 is, 3 by 100. Ten is allowed to be the perfect
   number. And 8 is the first cube, which is equality in all the
   dimensions--length, breadth, depth. "The days of men shall be," it is
   said, "120 (rk) years." [3336] And the sum is made up of the numbers
   from 1 to 15 added together. [3337] And the moon at 15 days is full.

   On another principle, 120 is a triangular [3338] number, and consists
   of the equality [3339] of the number 64, [which consists of eight of
   the odd numbers beginning with unity], [3340] the addition of which (1,
   3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15) in succession generate squares; [3341] and of
   the inequality of the number 56, consisting of seven of the even
   numbers beginning with 2 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14), which produce the
   numbers that are not squares. [3342]

   Again, according to another way of indicating, the number 120 consists
   of four numbers--of one triangle, 15; of another, a square, 25; of a
   third, a pentagon, 35; and of a fourth, a hexagon, 45. The 5 is taken
   according to the same ratio in each mode. For in triangular numbers,
   from the unity 5 comes 15; and in squares, 25; and of those in
   succession, proportionally. Now 25, which is the number 5 from unity,
   is said to be the symbol of the Levitical tribe. And the number 35
   depends also on the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic scale of
   doubles--6, 8, 9, 12; the addition of which makes 35. In these days,
   the Jews say that seven months' children are formed. And the number 45
   depends on the scale of triples--6, 9, 12, 18--the addition of which
   makes 45; and similarly, in these days they say that nine months'
   children are formed.

   Such, then, is the style of the example in arithmetic. And let the
   testimony of geometry be the tabernacle that was constructed, and the
   ark that was fashioned,--constructed in most regular proportions, and
   through divine ideas, by the gift of understanding, which leads us from
   things of sense to intellectual objects, or rather from these to holy
   things, and to the holy of holies. For the squares of wood indicate
   that the square form, producing right angles, pervades all, and points
   out security. And the length of the structure was three hundred cubits,
   and the breadth fifty, and the height thirty; and above, the ark ends
   in a cubit, narrowing to a cubit from the broad base like a pyramid,
   the symbol of those who are purified and tested by fire. And this
   geometrical proportion has a place, for the transport of those holy
   abodes, whose differences are indicated by the differences of the
   numbers set down below.

   And the numbers introduced are sixfold, as three hundred is six times
   fifty; and tenfold, as three hundred is ten times thirty; and
   containing one and two-thirds (epidimoiroi), for fifty is one and
   two-thirds of thirty.

   Now there are some who say that three hundred cubits are the symbol of
   the Lord's sign; [3343] and fifty, of hope and of the remission given
   at Pentecost; and thirty, or as in some, twelve, they say points out
   the preaching [of the Gospel]; because the Lord preached in His
   thirtieth year; and the apostles were twelve. And the structure's
   terminating in a cubit is the symbol of the advancement of the
   righteous to oneness and to "the unity of the faith." [3344]

   And the table which was in the temple was six cubits; [3345] and its
   four feet were about a cubit and a half.

   They add, then, the twelve cubits, agreeably to the revolution of the
   twelve months, in the annual circle, during which the earth produces
   and matures all things; adapting itself to the four seasons. And the
   table, in my opinion, exhibits the image of the earth, supported as it
   is on four feet, summer, autumn, spring, winter, by which the year
   travels. Wherefore also it is said that the table has "wavy chains;"
   [3346] either because the universe revolves in the circuits of the
   times, or perhaps it indicated the earth surrounded with ocean's tide.

   Further, as an example of music, let us adduce David, playing at once
   and prophesying, melodiously praising God. Now the Enarmonic [3347]
   suits best the Dorian harmony, and the Diatonic the Phrygian, as
   Aristoxenus says. The harmony, therefore, of the Barbarian psaltery,
   which exhibited gravity of strain, being the most ancient, most
   certainly became a model for Terpander, for the Dorian harmony, who
   sings the praise of Zeus thus:--


   "O Zeus, of all things the Beginning, Ruler of all;

   O Zeus, I send thee this beginning of hymns."

   The lyre, according to its primary signification, may by the psalmist
   be used figuratively for the Lord; according to its secondary, for
   those who continually strike the chords of their souls under the
   direction of the Choir-master, the Lord. And if the people saved be
   called the lyre, it will be understood to be in consequence of their
   giving glory musically, through the inspiration of the Word and the
   knowledge of God, being struck by the Word so as to produce faith. You
   may take music in another way, as the ecclesiastical symphony at once
   of the law and the prophets, and the apostles along with the Gospel,
   and the harmony which obtained in each prophet, in the transitions of
   the persons.

   But, as seems, the most of those who are inscribed with the Name,
   [3348] like the companions of Ulysses, handle the word unskilfully,
   passing by not the Sirens, but the rhythm and the melody, stopping
   their ears with ignorance; since they know that, after lending their
   ears to Hellenic studies, they will never subsequently be able to
   retrace their steps.

   But he who culls what is useful for the advantage of the catechumens,
   and especially when they are Greeks (and the earth is the Lord's, and
   the fulness thereof [3349] ), must not abstain from erudition, like
   irrational animals; but he must collect as many aids as possible for
   his hearers. But he must by no means linger over these studies, except
   solely for the advantage accruing from them; so that, on grasping and
   obtaining this, he may be able to take his departure home to the true
   philosophy, which is a strong cable for the soul, providing security
   from everything.

   Music is then to be handled for the sake of the embellishment and
   composure of manners. For instance, at a banquet we pledge each other
   while the music is playing; [3350] soothing by song the eagerness of
   our desires, and glorifying God for the copious gift of human
   enjoyments, for His perpetual supply of the food necessary for the
   growth of the body and of the soul. But we must reject superfluous
   music, which enervates men's souls, and leads to variety,--now
   mournful, and then licentious and voluptuous, and then frenzied and
   frantic.

   The same holds also of astronomy. For treating of the description of
   the celestial objects, about the form of the universe, and the
   revolution of the heavens, and the motion of the stars, leading the
   soul nearer to the creative power, it teaches to quickness in
   perceiving the seasons of the year, the changes of the air, and the
   appearance of the stars; since also navigation and husbandry derive
   from this much benefit, as architecture and building from geometry.
   This branch of learning, too, makes the soul in the highest degree
   observant, capable of perceiving the true and detecting the false, of
   discovering correspondences and proportions, so as to hunt out for
   similarity in things dissimilar; and conducts us to the discovery of
   length without breadth, and superficial extent without thickness, and
   an indivisible point, and transports to intellectual objects from those
   of sense.

   The studies of philosophy, therefore, and philosophy itself, are aids
   in treating of the truth. For instance, the cloak was once a fleece;
   then it was shorn, and became warp and woof; and then it was woven.
   Accordingly the soul must be prepared and variously exercised, if it
   would become in the highest degree good. For there is the scientific
   and the practical element in truth; and the latter flows from the
   speculative; and there is need of great practice, and exercise, and
   experience.

   But in speculation, one element relates to one's neighbours and another
   to one's self. Wherefore also training ought to be so moulded as to be
   adapted to both. He, then, who has acquired a competent acquaintance
   with the subjects which embrace the principles which conduce to
   scientific knowledge (gnosis), may stop and remain for the future in
   quiet, directing his actions in conformity with his theory.

   But for the benefit of one's neighbours, in the case of those who have
   proclivities for writing, and those who set themselves to deliver the
   word, both is other culture beneficial, and the reading of the
   Scriptures of the Lord is necessary, in order to the demonstration of
   what is said, and especially if those who hear are accessions from
   Hellenic culture.

   Such David describes the Church: "The queen stood on thy right hand,
   enveloped in a golden robe, variegated;" [3351] and with Hellenic and
   superabundant accomplishments, "clothed variegated with gold-fringed
   garments." [3352] And the Truth says by the Lord, "For who had known
   Thy counsel, hadst Thou not given wisdom, and sent Thy Holy Spirit from
   the Highest; and so the ways of those on earth were corrected, and men
   learned Thy decrees, and were saved by wisdom?" For the Gnostic knows
   things ancient by the Scripture, and conjectures things future: he
   understands the involutions of words and the solutions of enigmas. He
   knows beforehand signs and wonders, and the issues of seasons and
   periods, as we have said already. Seest thou the fountain of
   instructions that takes its rise from wisdom? But to those who object,
   What use is there in knowing the causes of the manner of the sun's
   motion, for example, and the rest of the heavenly bodies, or in having
   studied the theorems of geometry or logic, and each of the other
   branches of study?--for these are of no service in the discharge of
   duties, and the Hellenic philosophy is human wisdom, for it is
   incapable of teaching [3353] the truth--the following remarks are to be
   made. First, that they stumble in reference to the highest of
   things--namely, the mind's free choice. "For they," it is said, "who
   keep holy holy things, shall be made holy; and those who have been
   taught will find an answer." [3354] For the Gnostic alone will do
   holily, in accordance with reason all that has to be done, as he hath
   learned through the Lord's teaching, received through men.

   Again, on the other hand, we may hear: "For in His hand, that is, in
   His power and wisdom, are both we and our words, and all wisdom and
   skill in works; for God loves nothing but the man that dwells with
   wisdom." [3355] And again, they have not read what is said by Solomon;
   for, treating of the construction of the temple, he says expressly,
   "And it was Wisdom as artificer that framed it; and Thy providence, O
   Father, governs throughout." [3356] And how irrational, to regard
   philosophy as inferior to architecture and shipbuilding! And the Lord
   fed the multitude of those that reclined on the grass opposite to
   Tiberias with the two fishes and the five barley loaves, indicating the
   preparatory training of the Greeks and Jews previous to the divine
   grain, which is the food cultivated by the law. For barley is sooner
   ripe for the harvest than wheat; and the fishes signified the Hellenic
   philosophy that was produced and moved in the midst of the Gentile
   billow, given, as they were, for copious food to those lying on the
   ground, increasing no more, like the fragments of the loaves, but
   having partaken of the Lord's blessing, and breathed into them the
   resurrection of Godhead [3357] through the power of the Word. But if
   you are curious, understand one of the fishes to mean the curriculum of
   study, and the other the philosophy which supervenes. The gatherings
   [3358] point out the word of the Lord.


   "And the choir of mute fishes rushed to it,"

   says the Tragic Muse somewhere.

   "I must decrease," said the prophet John, [3359] and the Word of the
   Lord alone, in which the law terminates, "increase." Understand now for
   me the mystery of the truth, granting pardon if I shrink from advancing
   further in the treatment of it, by announcing this alone: "All things
   were made by Him, and without Him was not even one thing." [3360]
   Certainly He is called "the chief corner stone; in whom the whole
   building, fitly joined together, groweth into an holy temple of God,"
   [3361] according to the divine apostle.

   I pass over in silence at present the parable which says in the Gospel:
   "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who cast a net into the sea and
   out of the multitude of the fishes caught, makes a selection of the
   better ones." [3362]

   And now the wisdom which we possess announces the four virtues [3363]
   in such a way as to show that the sources of them were communicated by
   the Hebrews to the Greeks. This may be learned from the following: "And
   if one loves justice, its toils are virtues. For temperance and
   prudence teach justice and fortitude; and than these there is nothing
   more useful in life to men."

   Above all, this ought to be known, that by nature we are adapted for
   virtue; not so as to be possessed of it from our birth, but so as to be
   adapted for acquiring it.

      Chapter XII.--Human Nature Possesses an Adaptation for Perfection; The
      Gnostic Alone Attains It.

   By which consideration [3364] is solved the question propounded to us
   by the heretics, Whether Adam was created perfect or imperfect? Well,
   if imperfect, how could the work of a perfect God--above all, that work
   being man--be imperfect? And if perfect, how did he transgress the
   commandments? For they shall hear from us that he was not perfect in
   his creation, but adapted to the reception of virtue. For it is of
   great importance in regard to virtue to be made fit for its attainment.
   And it is intended that we should be saved by ourselves. This, then, is
   the nature of the soul, to move of itself. Then, as we are rational,
   and philosophy being rational, we have some affinity with it. Now an
   aptitude is a movement towards virtue, not virtue itself. All, then, as
   I said, are naturally constituted for the acquisition of virtue.

   But one man applies less, one more, to learning and training. Wherefore
   also some have been competent to attain to perfect virtue, and others
   have attained to a kind of it. And some, on the other hand, through
   negligence, although in other respects of good dispositions, have
   turned to the opposite. Now much more is that knowledge which excels
   all branches of culture in greatness and in truth, most difficult to
   acquire, and is attained with much toil. "But, as seems, they know not
   the mysteries of God. For God created man for immortality, and made him
   an image of His own nature;" [3365] according to which nature of Him
   who knows all, he who is a Gnostic, and righteous, and holy with
   prudence, hastes to reach the measure of perfect manhood. For not only
   are actions and thoughts, but words also, pure in the case of the
   Gnostic: "Thou hast proved mine heart; Thou hast visited me by night,"
   it is said; "Thou hast subjected me to the fire, and unrighteousness
   was not found in me: so that my mouth shall not speak the works of
   men." [3366]

   And why do I say the works of men? He recognises sin itself, which is
   not brought forward in order to repentance (for this is common to all
   believers); but what sin is. Nor does he condemn this or that sin, but
   simply all sin; nor is it what one has done ill that he brings up, but
   what ought not to be done. Whence also repentance is twofold: that
   which is common, on account of having transgressed; and that which,
   from learning the nature of sin, persuades, in the first instance, to
   keep from sinning, the result of which is not sinning.

   Let them not then say, that he who does wrong and sins transgresses
   through the agency of demons; for then he would be guiltless. But by
   choosing the same things as demons, by sinning; being unstable, and
   light, and fickle in his desires, like a demon, he becomes a demoniac
   man. Now he who is bad, having become, through evil, sinful by nature,
   becomes depraved, having what he has chosen; and being sinful, sins
   also in his actions. And again, the good man does right. Wherefore we
   call not only the virtues, but also right actions, good. And of things
   that are good we know that some are desirable for themselves, as
   knowledge; for we hunt for nothing from it when we have it, but only
   [seek] that it be with us, and that we be in uninterrupted
   contemplation, and strive to reach it for its own sake. But other
   things are desirable for other considerations, such as faith, for
   escape from punishment, and the advantage arising from reward, which
   accrue from it. For, in the case of many, fear is the cause of their
   not sinning; and the promise is the means of pursuing obedience, by
   which comes salvation. Knowledge, then, desirable as it is for its own
   sake, is the most perfect good; and consequently the things which
   follow by means of it are good. And punishment is the cause of
   correction to him who is punished; and to those who are able to see
   before them he becomes an example, to prevent them falling into the
   like.

   Let us then receive knowledge, not desiring its results, but embracing
   itself for the sake of knowing. For the first advantage is the habit of
   knowledge (gnostike), which furnishes harmless pleasures and exultation
   both for the present and the future. And exultation is said to be
   gladness, being a reflection of the virtue which is according to truth,
   through a kind of exhilaration and relaxation of soul. And the acts
   which partake of knowledge are good and fair actions. For abundance in
   the actions that are according to virtue, is the true riches, and
   destitution in decorous [3367] desires is poverty. For the use and
   enjoyment of necessaries are not injurious in quality, but in quantity,
   when in excess. Wherefore the Gnostic circumscribes his desires in
   reference both to possession and to enjoyment, not exceeding the limit
   of necessity. Therefore, regarding life in this world as necessary for
   the increase of science (episteme) and the acquisition of knowledge
   (gnosis), he will value highest, not living, but living well. He will
   therefore prefer neither children, nor marriage, nor parents, to love
   for God, and righteousness in life. To such an one, his wife, after
   conception, is as a sister, and is judged as if of the same father;
   then only recollecting her husband, when she looks on the children; as
   being destined to become a sister in reality after putting off the
   flesh, which separates and limits the knowledge of those who are
   spiritual by the peculiar characteristics of the sexes. For souls,
   themselves by themselves, are equal. Souls are neither male nor female,
   when they no longer marry nor are given in marriage. And is not woman
   translated into man, when she is become equally unfeminine, and manly,
   and perfect? Such, then, was the laughter of Sarah [3368] when she
   received the good news of the birth of a son; not, in my opinion, that
   she disbelieved the angel, but that she felt ashamed of the intercourse
   by means of which she was destined to become the mother of a son.

   And did not Abraham, when he was in danger on account of Sarah's
   beauty, with the king of Egypt, properly call her sister, being of the
   same father, but not of the same mother? [3369]

   To those, then, who have repented and not firmly believed, God grants
   their requests through their supplications. But to those who live
   sinlessly and gnostically, He gives, when they have but merely
   entertained the thought. For example, to Anna, on her merely conceiving
   the thought, conception was vouchsafed of the child Samuel. [3370]
   "Ask," says the Scripture, "and I will do. Think, and I will give." For
   we have heard that God knows the heart, not judging [3371] the soul
   from [external] movement, as we men; nor yet from the event. For it is
   ridiculous to think so. Nor was it as the architect praises the work
   when accomplished that God, on making the light and then seeing it,
   called it good. But He, knowing before He made it what it would be,
   praised that which was made, He having potentially made good, from the
   first by His purpose that had no beginning, what was destined to be
   good actually. Now that which has future He already said beforehand was
   good, the phrase concealing the truth by hyperbaton. Therefore the
   Gnostic prays in thought during every hour, being by love allied to
   God. And first he will ask forgiveness of sins; and after, that he may
   sin no more; and further, the power of well-doing and of comprehending
   the whole creation and administration by the Lord, that, becoming pure
   in heart through the knowledge, which is by the Son of God, he may be
   initiated into the beatific vision face to face, having heard the
   Scripture which says, "Fasting with prayer is a good thing." [3372]

   Now fastings signify abstinence from all evils whatsoever, both in
   action and in word, and in thought itself. As appears, then,
   righteousness is quadrangular; [3373] on all sides equal and like in
   word, in deed, in abstinence from evils, in beneficence, in gnostic
   perfection; nowhere, and in no respect halting, so that he does not
   appear unjust and unequal. As one, then, is righteous, so certainly is
   he a believer. But as he is a believer, he is not yet also righteous--I
   mean according to the righteousness of progress and perfection,
   according to which the Gnostic is called righteous.

   For instance, on Abraham becoming a believer, it was reckoned to him
   for righteousness, he having advanced to the greater and more perfect
   degree of faith. For he who merely abstains from evil conduct is not
   just, unless he also attain besides beneficence and knowledge; and for
   this reason some things are to be abstained from, others are to be
   done. "By the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the
   left," [3374] the apostle says, the righteous man is sent on to the
   inheritance above,--by some [arms] defended, by others putting forth
   his might. For the defence of his panoply alone, and abstinence from
   sins, are not sufficient for perfection, unless he assume in addition
   the work of righteousness--activity in doing good.

   Then our dexterous man and Gnostic is revealed in righteousness already
   even here, as Moses, glorified in the face of the soul, [3375] as we
   have formerly said, the body bears the stamp of the righteous soul. For
   as the mordant of the dyeing process, remaining in the wool, produces
   in it a certain quality and diversity from other wool; so also in the
   soul the pain is gone, but the good remains; and the sweet is left, but
   the base is wiped away. For these are two qualities characteristic of
   each soul, by which is known that which is glorified, and that which is
   condemned.

   And as in the case of Moses, from his righteous conduct, and from his
   uninterrupted intercourse with God, who spoke to him, a kind of
   glorified hue settled on his face; so also a divine power of goodness
   clinging to the righteous soul in contemplation and in prophecy, and in
   the exercise of the function of governing, impresses on it something,
   as it were, of intellectual radiance, like the solar ray, as a visible
   sign of righteousness, uniting the soul with light, through unbroken
   love, which is God-bearing and God-borne. Thence assimilation to God
   the Saviour arises to the Gnostic, as far as permitted to human nature,
   he being made perfect "as the Father who is in heaven." [3376]

   It is He Himself who says, "Little children, a little while I am still
   with you." [3377] Since also God Himself remains blessed and immortal,
   neither molested nor molesting another; [3378] not in consequence of
   being by nature good, but in consequence of doing good in a manner
   peculiar to Himself. God being essentially, and proving Himself
   actually, both Father and good, continues immutably in the self-same
   goodness. For what is the use of good that does not act and do good?

      Chapter XIII.--Degrees of Glory in Heaven Corresponding with the Dignities
      of the Church Below.

   He, then, who has first moderated his passions and trained himself for
   impassibility, and developed to the beneficence of gnostic perfection,
   is here equal to the angels. Luminous already, and like the sun shining
   in the exercise of beneficence, he speeds by righteous knowledge
   through the love of God to the sacred abode, like as the apostles. Not
   that they became apostles through being chosen for some distinguished
   peculiarity [3379] of nature, since also Judas was chosen along with
   them. But they were capable of becoming apostles on being chosen by Him
   who foresees even ultimate issues. Matthias, accordingly, who was not
   chosen along with them, on showing himself worthy of becoming an
   apostle, is substituted for Judas.

   Those, then, also now, who have exercised themselves in the Lord's
   commandments, and lived perfectly and gnostically according to the
   Gospel, may be enrolled in the chosen body of the apostles. Such an one
   is in reality a presbyter of the Church, and a true minister (deacon)
   of the will of God, if he do and teach what is the Lord's; not as being
   ordained [3380] by men, nor regarded righteous because a presbyter, but
   enrolled in the presbyterate [3381] because righteous. And although
   here upon earth he be not honoured with the chief seat, [3382] he will
   sit down on the four-and-twenty thrones, [3383] judging the people, as
   John says in the Apocalypse.

   For, in truth, the covenant of salvation, reaching down to us from the
   foundation of the world, through different generations and times, is
   one, though conceived as different in respect of gift. For it follows
   that there is one unchangeable gift of salvation given by one God,
   through one Lord, benefiting in many ways. For which cause the middle
   wall [3384] which separated the Greek from the Jew is taken away, in
   order that there might be a peculiar people. And so both meet in the
   one unity of faith; and the selection out of both is one. And the
   chosen of the chosen are those who by reason of perfect knowledge are
   called [as the best] from the Church itself, and honoured with the most
   august glory--the judges and rulers--four-and-twenty (the grace being
   doubled) equally from Jews and Greeks. Since, according to my opinion,
   the grades [3385] here in the Church, of bishops, presbyters, deacons,
   are imitations of the angelic glory, and of that economy which, the
   Scriptures say, awaits those who, following the footsteps of the
   apostles, have lived in perfection of righteousness according to the
   Gospel. For these taken up in the clouds, the apostle [3386] writes,
   will first minister [as deacons], then be classed in the presbyterate,
   by promotion in glory (for glory differs [3387] from glory) till they
   grow into "a perfect man." [3388]

      Chapter XIV.--Degrees of Glory in Heaven.

   Such, according to David, "rest in the holy hill of God," [3389] in the
   Church far on high, in which are gathered the philosophers of God, "who
   are Israelites indeed, who are pure in heart, in whom there is no
   guile;" [3390] who do not remain in the seventh seat, the place of
   rest, but are promoted, through the active beneficence of the divine
   likeness, to the heritage of beneficence which is the eighth grade;
   devoting themselves to the pure vision [3391] of insatiable
   contemplation.

   "And other sheep there are also," saith the Lord, "which are not of
   this fold" [3392] --deemed worthy of another fold and mansion, in
   proportion to their faith. "But My sheep hear My voice," [3393]
   understanding gnostically the commandments. And this is to be taken in
   a magnanimous and worthy acceptation, along with also the recompense
   and accompaniment of works. So that when we hear, "Thy faith hath saved
   thee," [3394] we do not understand Him to say absolutely that those who
   have believed in any way whatever shall be saved, unless also works
   follow. But it was to the Jews alone that He spoke this utterance, who
   kept the law and lived blamelessly, who wanted only faith in the Lord.
   No one, then, can be a believer and at the same time be licentious; but
   though he quit the flesh, he must put off the passions, so as to be
   capable of reaching his own mansion.

   Now to know is more than to believe, as to be dignified with the
   highest honour after being saved is a greater thing than being saved.
   Accordingly the believer, through great discipline, divesting himself
   of the passions, passes to the mansion which is better than the former
   one, viz., to the greatest torment, taking with him the characteristic
   of repentance from the sins he has committed after baptism. He is
   tortured then still more--not yet or not quite attaining what he sees
   others to have acquired. Besides, he is also ashamed of his
   transgressions. The greatest torments, indeed, are assigned to the
   believer. For God's righteousness is good, and His goodness is
   righteous. And though the punishments cease in the course of the
   completion of the expiation and purification of each one, yet those
   have very great and permanent grief who [3395] are found worthy of the
   other fold, on account of not being along with those that have been
   glorified through righteousness.

   For instance, Solomon, calling the Gnostic, wise, speaks thus of those
   who admire the dignity of his mansion: "For they shall see the end of
   the wise, and to what a degree the Lord has established him." [3396]
   And of his glory they will say, "This was he whom we once held up to
   derision, and made a byword of reproach; fools that we were! We thought
   his life madness, and his end dishonourable. How is he reckoned among
   the sons of God, and his inheritance among the saints?" [3397]

   Not only then the believer, but even the heathen, is judged most
   righteously. For since God knew in virtue of His prescience that he
   would not believe, He nevertheless, in order that he might receive his
   own perfection gave him philosophy, but gave it him previous to faith.
   And He gave the sun, and the moon, and the stars to be worshipped;
   "which God," the Law says, [3398] made for the nations, that they might
   not become altogether atheistical, and so utterly perish. But they,
   also in the instance of this commandment, having become devoid of
   sense, and addicting themselves to graven images, are judged unless
   they repent; some of them because, though able, they would not believe
   God; and others because, though willing, they did not take the
   necessary pains to become believers. There were also, however, those
   who, from the worship of the heavenly bodies, did not return to the
   Maker of them. For this was the sway given to the nations to rise up to
   God, by means of the worship of the heavenly bodies. But those who
   would not abide by those heavenly bodies assigned to them, but fell
   away from them to stocks and stones, "were counted," it is said, "as
   chaff-dust and as a drop from a jar," [3399] beyond salvation, cast
   away from the body.

   As, then, to be simply saved is the result of medium [3400] actions,
   but to be saved rightly and becomingly [3401] is right action, so also
   all action of the Gnostic may be called right action; that of the
   simple believer, intermediate action, not yet perfected according to
   reason, not yet made right according to knowledge; but that of every
   heathen again is sinful. For it is not simply doing well, but doing
   actions with a certain aim, and acting according to reason, that the
   Scriptures exhibit as requisite. [3402]

   As, then, lyres ought not to be touched by those who are destitute of
   skill in playing the lyre, nor flutes by those who are unskilled in
   flute-playing, neither are those to put their hand to affairs who have
   not knowledge, and know not how to use them in the whole [3403] of
   life.

   The struggle for freedom, then, is waged not alone by the athletes of
   battles in wars, but also in banquets, and in bed, and in the
   tribunals, by those who are anointed by the word, who are ashamed to
   become the captives of pleasures.

   "I would never part with virtue for unrighteous gain." But plainly,
   unrighteous gain is pleasure and pain, toil and fear; and, to speak
   comprehensively, the passions of the soul, the present of which is
   delightful, the future vexatious. "For what is the profit," it is said,
   "if you gain the world and lose the soul?" [3404] It is clear, then,
   that those who do not perform good actions, do not know what is for
   their own advantage. And if so, neither are they capable of praying
   aright, so as to receive from God good things; nor, should they receive
   them, will they be sensible of the boon; nor, should they enjoy them,
   will they enjoy worthily what they know not; both from their want of
   knowledge how to use the good things given them, and from their
   excessive stupidity, being ignorant of the way to avail themselves of
   the divine gifts.

   Now stupidity is the cause of ignorance. And it appears to me that it
   is the vaunt of a boastful soul, though of one with a good conscience,
   to exclaim against what happens through circumstances:--


   "Therefore let them do what they may; [3405]

   For it shall be well with me; and Right

   Shall be my ally, and I shall not be caught doing evil."

   But such a good conscience preserves sanctity towards God and justice
   towards men; keeping the soul pure with grave thoughts, and pure words,
   and just deeds. By thus receiving the Lord's power, the soul studies to
   be God; regarding nothing bad but ignorance, and action contrary to
   right reason. And giving thanks always for all things to God, by
   righteous hearing and divine reading, by true investigation, by holy
   oblation, by blessed prayer; lauding, hymning, blessing, praising, such
   a soul is never at any time separated from God. [3406] Rightly then is
   it said, "And they who trust in Him shall understand the truth, and
   those faithful in love shall abide by Him." [3407] You see what
   statements Wisdom makes about the Gnostics.

   Conformably, therefore, there are various abodes, according to the
   worth of those who have believed. [3408] To the point Solomon says,
   "For there shall be given to him the choice grace of faith, and a more
   pleasant lot in the temple of the Lord." [3409] For the comparative
   shows that there are lower parts in the temple of God, which is the
   whole Church. And the superlative remains to be conceived, where the
   Lord is. These chosen abodes, which are three, are indicated by the
   numbers in the Gospel--the thirty, the sixty, the hundred. [3410] And
   the perfect inheritance belongs to those who attain to "a perfect man,"
   according to the image of the Lord. And the likeness is not, as some
   imagine, that of the human form; for this consideration is impious. Nor
   is the likeness to the first cause that which consists in virtue. For
   this utterance is also impious, being that of those who have imagined
   that virtue in man and in the sovereign God is the same. "Thou hast
   supposed iniquity," He says, "[in imagining] that I will be like to
   thee." [3411] But "it is enough for the disciple to become as the
   Master," [3412] saith the Master. To the likeness of God, then, he that
   is introduced into adoption and the friendship of God, to the just
   inheritance of the lords and gods is brought; if he be perfected,
   according to the Gospel, as the Lord Himself taught.

      Chapter XV.--Different Degrees of Knowledge.

   The Gnostic, then, is impressed with the closest likeness, that is,
   with the mind of the Master; which He being possessed of, commanded and
   recommended to His disciples and to the prudent. Comprehending this, as
   He who taught wished, and receiving it in its grand sense, he teaches
   worthily "on the housetops" [3413] those capable of being built to a
   lofty height; and begins the doing of what is spoken, in accordance
   with the example of life. For He enjoined what is possible. And, in
   truth, the kingly man and Christian ought to be ruler and leader. For
   we are commanded to be lords over not only the wild beasts without us,
   but also over the wild passions within ourselves.

   Through the knowledge, then, as appears, of a bad and good life is the
   Gnostic saved, understanding and executing "more than the scribes and
   Pharisees." [3414] "Exert thyself, and prosper, and reign" writes
   David, "because of truth, and meekness, and righteousness; and thy
   right hand shall guide thee marvellously," [3415] that is, the Lord.
   "Who then is the wise? and he shall understand these things. Prudent?
   and he shall know them. For the ways of the Lord are right," [3416]
   says the prophet, showing that the Gnostic alone is able to understand
   and explain the things spoken by the Spirit obscurely. "And he who
   understands in that time shall hold his peace," [3417] says the
   Scripture, plainly in the way of declaring them to the unworthy. For
   the Lord says, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear," [3418]
   declaring that hearing and understanding belong not to all. To the
   point David writes: "Dark water is in the clouds of the skies. At the
   gleam before Him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire;" [3419]
   showing that the holy words are hidden. He intimates that transparent
   and resplendent to the Gnostics, like the innocuous hail, they are sent
   down from God; but that they are dark to the multitude, like
   extinguished coals out of the fire, which, unless kindled and set on
   fire, will not give forth fire or light. "The Lord, therefore," it is
   said, "gives me the tongue of instruction, so as to know in season when
   it is requisite to speak a word;" [3420] not in the way of testimony
   alone, but also in the way of question and answer. "And the instruction
   of the Lord opens my mouth." [3421] It is the prerogative of the
   Gnostic, then, to know how to make use of speech, and when, and how,
   and to whom. And already the apostle, by saying, "After the rudiments
   of the world, and not after Christ," [3422] makes the asseveration that
   the Hellenic teaching is elementary, and that of Christ perfect, as we
   have already intimated before.

   "Now the wild olive is inserted into the fatness of the olive," [3423]
   and is indeed of the same species as the cultivated olives. For the
   graft uses as soil the tree in which it is engrafted. Now all the
   plants sprouted forth simultaneously in consequence of the divine
   order. Wherefore also, though the wild olive be wild, it crowns the
   Olympic victors. And the elm teaches the vine to be fruitful, by
   leading it up to a height. Now we see that wild trees attract more
   nutriment, because they cannot ripen. The wild trees, therefore, have
   less power of secretion than those that are cultivated. And the cause
   of their wildness is the want of the power of secretion. The engrafted
   olive accordingly receives more nutriment from its growing in the wild
   one; and it gets accustomed, as it were, to secrete the nutriment,
   becoming thus assimilated [3424] to the fatness of the cultivated tree.

   So also the philosopher, resembling the wild olive, in having much that
   is undigested, on account of his devotion to the search, his propensity
   to follow, and his eagerness to seize the fatness of the truth; if he
   get besides the divine power, through faith, by being transplanted into
   the good and mild knowledge, like the wild olive, engrafted in the
   truly fair and merciful Word, he both assimilates the nutriment that is
   supplied, and becomes a fair and good olive tree. For engrafting makes
   worthless shoots noble, and compels the barren to be fruitful by the
   art of culture and by gnostic skill.

        Different modes of engrafting illustrative of different kinds of
        conversion.

   They say that engrafting is effected in four modes: one, that in which
   the graft must be fitted in between the wood and the bark; resembling
   the way in which we instruct plain people belonging to the Gentiles,
   who receive the word superficially. Another is, when the wood is cleft,
   and there is inserted in it the cultivated branch. And this applies to
   the case of those who have studied philosophy; for on cutting through
   their dogmas, the acknowledgment of the truth is produced in them. So
   also in the case of the Jews, by opening up the Old Testament, the new
   and noble plant of the olive is inserted. The third mode of engrafting
   applies to rustics and heretics, who are brought by force to the truth.
   For after smoothing off both suckers with a sharp pruning-hook, till
   the pith is laid bare, but not wounded, they are bound together. And
   the fourth is that form of engrafting called budding. For a bud (eye)
   is cut out of a trunk of a good sort, a circle being drawn round in the
   bark along with it, of the size of the palm. Then the trunk is
   stripped, to suit the eye, over an equal circumference. And so the
   graft is inserted, tied round, and daubed with clay, the bud being kept
   uninjured and unstained. This is the style of gnostic teaching, which
   is capable of looking into things themselves. This mode is, in truth,
   of most service in the case of cultivated trees. And "the engrafting
   into the good olive" mentioned by the apostle, may be [engrafting into]
   Christ Himself; the uncultivated and unbelieving nature being
   transplanted into Christ--that is, in the case of those who believe in
   Christ. But it is better [to understand it] of the engrafting [3425] of
   each one's faith in the soul itself. For also the Holy Spirit is thus
   somehow transplanted by distribution, according to the circumscribed
   capacity of each one, but without being circumscribed.

        Knowledge and love.

   Now, discoursing on knowledge, Solomon speaks thus: "For wisdom is
   resplendent and fadeless, and is easily beheld by those who love her.
   She is beforehand in making herself known to those who desire her. He
   that rises early for her shall not toil wearily. For to think about her
   is the perfection of good sense. And he that keeps vigils for her shall
   quickly be relieved of anxiety. For she goes about, herself seeking
   those worthy of her (for knowledge belongs not to all); and in all ways
   she benignly shows herself to them." [3426] Now the paths are the
   conduct of life, and the variety that exists in the covenants.
   Presently he adds: "And in every thought she meets them," [3427] being
   variously contemplated, that is, by all discipline. Then he subjoins,
   adducing love, which perfects by syllogistic reasoning and true
   propositions, drawing thus a most convincing and true inference, "For
   the beginning of her is the truest desire of instruction," that is, of
   knowledge; "prudence is the love of instruction, and love is the
   keeping of its laws; and attention to its laws is the confirmation of
   immortality; and immortality causes nearness to God. The desire of
   wisdom leads, then, to the kingdom." [3428]

   For he teaches, as I think, that true instruction is desire for
   knowledge; and the practical exercise of instruction produces love of
   knowledge. And love is the keeping of the commandments which lead to
   knowledge. And the keeping of them is the establishment of the
   commandments, from which immortality results. "And immortality brings
   us near to God."

        True knowledge found in the teaching of Christ alone.

   If, then, the love of knowledge produces immortality, and leads the
   kingly man near to God the King, knowledge ought to be sought till it
   is found. Now seeking is an effort at grasping, and finds the subject
   by means of certain signs. And discovery is the end and cessation of
   inquiry, which has now its object in its grasp. And this is knowledge.
   And this discovery, properly so called, is knowledge, which is the
   apprehension of the object of search. And they say that a proof is
   either the antecedent, or the coincident, or the consequent. The
   discovery, then, of what is sought respecting God, is the teaching
   through the Son; and the proof of our Saviour being the very Son of God
   is the prophecies which preceded His coming, announcing Him; and the
   testimonies regarding Him which attended His birth in the world; in
   addition, His powers proclaimed and openly shown after His ascension.

   The proof of the truth being with us, is the fact of the Son of God
   Himself having taught us. For if in every inquiry these universals are
   found, a person and a subject, that which is truly the truth is shown
   to be in our hands alone. For the Son of God is the person of the truth
   which is exhibited; and the subject is the power of faith, which
   prevails over the opposition of every one whatever, and the assault of
   the whole world.

   But since this is confessedly established by eternal facts and reasons,
   and each one who thinks that there is no Providence has already been
   seen to deserve punishment and not contradiction, and is truly an
   atheist, it is our aim to discover what doing, and in what manner
   living, we shall reach the knowledge of the sovereign God, and how,
   honouring the Divinity, we may become authors of our own salvation.
   Knowing and learning, not from the Sophists, but from God Himself, what
   is well-pleasing to Him, we endeavour to do what is just and holy. Now
   it is well-pleasing to Him that we should be saved; and salvation is
   effected through both well-doing and knowledge, of both of which the
   Lord is the teacher.

   If, then, according to Plato, it is only possible to learn the truth
   either from God or from the progeny of God, with reason we, selecting
   testimonies from the divine oracles, boast of learning the truth by the
   Son of God, prophesied at first, and then explained.

        Philosophy and heresies, aids in discovering the truth.

   But the things which co-operate in the discovery of truth are not to be
   rejected. Philosophy, accordingly, which proclaims a Providence, and
   the recompense of a life of felicity, and the punishment, on the other
   hand, of a life of misery, teaches theology comprehensively; but it
   does not preserve accuracy and particular points; for neither
   respecting the Son of God, nor respecting the economy of Providence,
   does it treat similarly with us; for it did not know the worship of
   God.

   Wherefore also the heresies of the Barbarian philosophy, although they
   speak of one God, though they sing the praises of Christ, speak without
   accuracy, not in accordance with truth; for they discover another God,
   and receive Christ not as the prophecies deliver. But their false
   dogmas, while they oppose the conduct that is according to the truth,
   are against us. For instance, Paul circumcised Timothy because of the
   Jews who believed, in order that those who had received their training
   from the law might not revolt from the faith through his breaking such
   points of the law as were understood more carnally, knowing right well
   that circumcision does not justify; for he professed that "all things
   were for all" by conformity, preserving those of the dogmas that were
   essential, "that he might gain all." [3429] And Daniel, under the king
   of the Persians, wore "the chain," [3430] though he despised not the
   afflictions of the people.

   The liars, then, in reality are not those who for the sake of the
   scheme of salvation conform, nor those who err in minute points, but
   those who are wrong in essentials, and reject the Lord, and as far as
   in them lies deprive the Lord of the true teaching; who do not quote or
   deliver the Scriptures in a manner worthy of God and of the Lord;
   [3431] for the deposit rendered to God, according to the teaching of
   the Lord by His apostles, is the understanding and the practice of the
   godly tradition. "And what ye hear in the ear"--that is, in a hidden
   manner, and in a mystery (for such things are figuratively said to be
   spoken in the ear)--"proclaim," He says, "on the housetops,"
   understanding them sublimely, and delivering them in a lofty strain,
   and according to the canon of the truth explaining the Scriptures; for
   neither prophecy nor the Saviour Himself announced the divine mysteries
   simply so as to be easily apprehended by all and sundry, but express
   them in parables. The apostles accordingly say of the Lord, that "He
   spake all things in parables, and without a parable spake He nothing
   unto them;" [3432] and if "all things were made by Him, and without Him
   was not anything made that was made," [3433] consequently also prophecy
   and the law were by Him, and were spoken by Him in parables. "But all
   things are right," says the Scripture, [3434] "before those who
   understand," that is, those who receive and observe, according to the
   ecclesiastical rule, the exposition of the Scriptures explained by Him;
   and the ecclesiastical rule is the concord and harmony of the law and
   the prophets in the covenant delivered at the coming of the Lord.
   Knowledge is then followed by practical wisdom, and practical wisdom by
   self-control: for it may be said that practical wisdom is divine
   knowledge, and exists in those who are deified; but that self-control
   is mortal, and subsists in those who philosophize, and are not yet
   wise. But if virtue is divine, so is also the knowledge of it; while
   self-control is a sort of imperfect wisdom which aspires after wisdom,
   and exerts itself laboriously, and is not contemplative. As certainly
   righteousness, being human, is, as being a common thing, subordinate to
   holiness, which subsists through the divine righteousness; [3435] for
   the righteousness of the perfect man does not rest on civil contracts,
   or on the prohibition of law, but flows from his own spontaneous action
   and his love to God.

        Reasons for the meaning of Scripture being veiled.

   For many reasons, then, the Scriptures hide the sense. First, that we
   may become inquisitive, and be ever on the watch for the discovery of
   the words of salvation. Then it was not suitable for all to understand,
   so that they might not receive harm in consequence of taking in another
   sense the things declared for salvation by the Holy Spirit. Wherefore
   the holy mysteries of the prophecies are veiled in the
   parables--preserved for chosen men, selected to knowledge in
   consequence of their faith; for the style of the Scriptures is
   parabolic. Wherefore also the Lord, who was not of the world, came as
   one who was of the world to men. For He was clothed with all virtue;
   and it was His aim to lead man, the foster-child of the world, up to
   the objects of intellect, and to the most essential truths by
   knowledge, from one world to another.

   Wherefore also He employed metaphorical description; for such is the
   parable,--a narration based on some subject which is not the principal
   subject, but similar to the principal subject, and leading him who
   understands to what is the true and principal thing; or, as some say, a
   mode of speech presenting with vigour, by means of other circumstances,
   what is the principal subject.

   And now also the whole economy which prophesied of the Lord appears
   indeed a parable to those who know not the truth, when one speaks and
   the rest hear that the Son of God--of Him who made the
   universe--assumed flesh, and was conceived in the virgin's womb (as His
   material body was produced), and subsequently, as was the case,
   suffered and rose again, being "to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to
   the Greeks foolishness," as the apostle says.

   But on the Scriptures being opened up, and declaring the truth to those
   who have ears, they proclaim the very suffering endured by the flesh,
   which the Lord assumed, to be "the power and wisdom of God." And
   finally, the parabolic style of Scripture being of the greatest
   antiquity, as we have shown, abounded most, as was to be expected, in
   the prophets, in order that the Holy Spirit might show that the
   philosophers among the Greeks, and the wise men among the Barbarians
   besides, were ignorant of the future coming of the Lord, and of the
   mystic teaching that was to be delivered by Him. Rightly then,
   prophecy, in proclaiming the Lord, in order not to seem to some to
   blaspheme while speaking what was beyond the ideas of the multitude,
   embodied its declarations in expressions capable of leading to other
   conceptions. Now all the prophets who foretold the Lord's coming, and
   the holy mysteries accompanying it, were persecuted and killed. As also
   the Lord Himself, in explaining the Scriptures to them, and His
   disciples who preached the word like Him, and subsequently to His life,
   used parables. [3436] Whence also Peter, in his Preaching, speaking of
   the apostles, says: "But we, unrolling the books of the prophets which
   we possess, who name Jesus Christ, partly in parables, partly in
   enigmas, partly expressly and in so many words, find His coming and
   death, and cross, and all the rest of the tortures which the Jews
   inflicted on Him, and His resurrection and assumption to heaven
   previous to the capture [3437] of Jerusalem. As it is written, These
   things are all that He behoves to suffer, and what should be after Him.
   Recognising them, therefore, we have believed in God in consequence of
   what is written respecting Him."

   And after a little again he draws the inference that the Scriptures
   owed their origin to the divine providence, asserting as follows: "For
   we know that God enjoined these things, and we say nothing apart from
   the Scriptures."

   Now the Hebrew dialect, like all the rest, has certain properties,
   consisting in a mode of speech which exhibits the national character.
   Dialect is accordingly defined as a style of speech produced by the
   national character. But prophecy is not marked by those dialects. For
   in the Hellenic writings, what are called changes of figures purposely
   produce obscurations, deduced after the style of our prophecies. But
   this is effected through the voluntary departure from direct speech
   which takes place in metrical or offhand diction. A figure, then, is a
   form of speech transferred from what is literal to what is not literal,
   for the sake of the composition, and on account of a diction useful in
   speech.

   But prophecy does not employ figurative forms in the expressions for
   the sake of beauty of diction. But from the fact that truth appertains
   not to all, it is veiled in manifold ways, causing the light to arise
   only on those who are initiated into knowledge, who seek the truth
   through love. The proverb, according to the Barbarian philosophy, is
   called a mode of prophecy, and the parable is so called, and the enigma
   in addition. Further also, they are called "wisdom;" and again, as
   something different from it, "instruction and words of prudence," and
   "turnings of words," and "true righteousness;" and again, "teaching to
   direct judgment," and "subtlety to the simple," which is the result of
   training, "and perception and thought," with which the young catechumen
   is imbued. [3438] "He who hears these prophets, being wise, will be
   wiser. And the intelligent man will acquire rule, and will understand a
   parable and a dark saying, the words and enigmas of the wise." [3439]

   And if it was the case that the Hellenic dialects received their
   appellation from Hellen, the son of Zeus, surnamed Deucalion, from the
   chronology which we have already exhibited, it is comparatively easy to
   perceive by how many generations the dialects that obtained among the
   Greeks are posterior to the language of the Hebrews.

   But as the work advances, we shall in each section, noting the figures
   of speech mentioned above by the prophet, [3440] exhibit the gnostic
   mode of life, showing it systematically according to the rule of the
   truth.

   Did not the Power also, that appeared to Hermas in the Vision, in the
   form of the Church, give for transcription the book which she wished to
   be made known to the elect? And this, he says, he transcribed to the
   letter, without finding how to complete the syllables. [3441] And this
   signified that the Scripture is clear to all, when taken according to
   the bare reading; and that this is the faith which occupies the place
   of the rudiments. Wherefore also the figurative expression is employed,
   "reading according to the letter;" while we understand that the gnostic
   unfolding of the Scriptures, when faith has already reached an advanced
   state, is likened to reading according to the syllables.

   Further, Esaias the prophet is ordered to take "a new book, and write
   in it" [3442] certain things: the Spirit prophesying that through the
   exposition of the Scriptures there would come afterwards the sacred
   knowledge, which at that period was still unwritten, because not yet
   known. For it was spoken from the beginning to those only who
   understand. Now that the Saviour has taught the apostles, the unwritten
   rendering [3443] of the written [Scripture] has been handed down also
   to us, inscribed by the power of God on hearts new, according to the
   renovation of the book. Thus those of highest repute among the Greeks,
   dedicate the fruit of the pomegranate to Hermes, who they say is
   speech, on account of its interpretation. For speech conceals much.
   Rightly, therefore, Jesus the son of Nave saw Moses, when taken up [to
   heaven], double,--one Moses with the angels, and one on the mountains,
   honoured with burial in their ravines. And Jesus saw this spectacle
   below, being elevated by the Spirit, along also with Caleb. But both do
   not see similarly. But the one descended with greater speed, as if the
   weight he carried was great; while the other, on descending after him,
   subsequently related the glory which he beheld, being able to perceive
   more than the other as having grown purer; the narrative, in my
   opinion, showing that knowledge is not the privilege of all. Since some
   look at the body of the Scriptures, the expressions and the names as to
   the body of Moses; while others see through to the thoughts and what it
   is signified by the names, seeking the Moses that is with the angels.

   Many also of those who called to the Lord said, "Son of David, have
   mercy on me." [3444] A few, too, knew Him as the Son of God; as Peter,
   whom also He pronounced blessed, "for flesh and blood revealed not the
   truth to him, but His Father in heaven," [3445] --showing that the
   Gnostic recognises the Son of the Omnipotent, not by His flesh
   conceived in the womb, but by the Father's own power. That it is
   therefore not only to those who read simply that the acquisition of the
   truth is so difficult, but that not even to those whose prerogative the
   knowledge of the truth is, is the contemplation of it vouch-safed all
   at once, the history of Moses teaches, until, accustomed to gaze, at
   the Hebrews on the glory of Moses, and the prophets of Israel on the
   visions of angels, so we also become able to look the splendours of
   truth in the face.

      Chapter XVI.--Gnostic Exposition of the Decalogue.

   Let the Decalogue be set forth cursorily by us as a specimen for
   gnostic exposition.

        The number "Ten."

   That ten is a sacred number, it is superfluous to say now. And if the
   tables that were written were the work of God, they will be found to
   exhibit physical creation. For by the "finger of God" is understood the
   power of God, by which the creation of heaven and earth is
   accomplished; of both of which the tables will be understood to be
   symbols. For the writing and handiwork of God put on the table is the
   creation of the world.

   And the Decalogue, viewed as an image of heaven, embraces sun and moon,
   stars, clouds, light, wind, water, air, darkness, fire. This is the
   physical Decalogue of the heaven.

   And the representation of the earth contains men, cattle, reptiles,
   wild beasts; and of the inhabitants of the water, fishes and whales;
   and again, of the winged tribes, those that are carnivorous, and those
   that use mild food; and of plants likewise, both fruit-bearing and
   barren. This is the physical Decalogue of the earth.

   And the ark which held them [3446] will then be the knowledge of divine
   and human things and wisdom. [3447]

   And perhaps the two tables themselves may be the prophecy of the two
   covenants. They were accordingly mystically renewed, as ignorance along
   with sin abounded. The commandments are written, then, doubly, as
   appears, for twofold spirits, the ruling and the subject. "For the
   flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh."
   [3448]

   And there is a ten in man himself: the five senses, and the power of
   speech, and that of reproduction; and the eighth is the spiritual
   principle communicated at his creation; and the ninth the ruling
   faculty of the soul; and tenth, there is the distinctive characteristic
   of the Holy Spirit, which comes to him through faith.

   Besides, in addition to these ten human parts, the law appear to give
   its injunctions [3449] to sight, and hearing, and smell, and touch, and
   taste, and to the organs subservient to these, which are double--the
   hands and the feet. For such is the formation of man. And the soul is
   introduced, and previous to it the ruling faculty, by which we reason,
   not produced in procreation; so that without it there is made up the
   number ten, of the faculties by which all the activity of man is
   carried out. For in order, straightway on man's entering existence, his
   life begins with sensations. We accordingly assert that rational and
   ruling power is the cause of the constitution of the living creature;
   also that this, the irrational part, is animated, and is a part of it.
   Now the vital force, in which is comprehended the power of nutrition
   and growth, and generally of motion, is assigned to the carnal spirit,
   which has great susceptibility of motion, and passes in all directions
   through the senses and the rest of the body, and through the body is
   the primary subject of sensations. But the power of choice, in which
   investigation, and study, and knowledge, reside, belongs to the ruling
   faculty. But all the faculties are placed in relation to one--the
   ruling faculty: it is through that man lives, and lives in a certain
   way.

   Through the corporeal spirit, then, man perceives, desires, rejoices,
   is angry, is nourished, grows. It is by it, too, that thoughts and
   conceptions advance to actions. And when it masters the desires, the
   ruling faculty reigns.

   The commandment, then, "Thou shalt not lust," says, thou shalt not
   serve the carnal spirit, but shall rule over it; "For the flesh lusteth
   against the Spirit," [3450] and excites to disorderly conduct against
   nature; "and the Spirit against the flesh" exercises sway, in order
   that the conduct of the man may be according to nature.

   Is not man, then, rightly said "to have been made in the image of
   God?"--not in the form of his [corporeal] structure; but inasmuch as
   God creates all things by the Word (logo), and the man who has become a
   Gnostic performs good actions by the faculty of reason (to logiko),
   properly therefore the two tables are also said to mean the
   commandments that were given to the twofold spirits,--those
   communicated before the law to that which was created, and to the
   ruling faculty; and the movements of the senses are both copied in the
   mind, and manifested in the activity which proceeds from the body. For
   apprehension results from both combined. Again, as sensation is related
   to the world of sense, so is thought to that of intellect. And actions
   are twofold--those of thought, those of act.

        The First Commandment.

   The first commandment of the Decalogue shows that there is one only
   Sovereign God; [3451] who led the people from the land of Egypt through
   the desert to their fatherland; that they might apprehend His power, as
   they were able, by means of the divine works, and withdraw from the
   idolatry of created things, putting all their hope in the true God.

        The Second Commandment.

   The second word [3452] intimated that men ought not to take and confer
   the august power of God (which is the name, for this alone were many
   even yet capable of learning), and transfer His title to things created
   and vain, which human artificers have made, among which "He that is" is
   not ranked. For in His uncreated identity, "He that is" is absolutely
   alone.

        The Fourth Commandment.

   And the fourth [3453] word is that which intimates that the world was
   created by God, and that He gave us the seventh day as a rest, on
   account of the trouble that there is in life. For God is incapable of
   weariness, and suffering, and want. But we who bear flesh need rest.
   The seventh day, therefore, is proclaimed a rest--abstraction from
   ills--preparing for the Primal Day, [3454] our true rest; which, in
   truth, is the first creation of light, in which all things are viewed
   and possessed. From this day the first wisdom and knowledge illuminate
   us. For the light of truth--a light true, casting no shadow, is the
   Spirit of God indivisibly divided to all, who are sanctified by faith,
   holding the place of a luminary, in order to the knowledge of real
   existences. By following Him, therefore, through our whole life, we
   become impassible; and this is to rest. [3455]

   Wherefore Solomon also says, that before heaven, and earth, and all
   existences, Wisdom had arisen in the Almighty; the participation of
   which--that which is by power, I mean, not that by essence--teaches a
   man to know by apprehension things divine and human. Having reached
   this point, we must mention these things by the way; since the
   discourse has turned on the seventh and the eighth. For the eighth may
   possibly turn out to be properly the seventh, and the seventh
   manifestly the sixth, and the latter properly the Sabbath, and the
   seventh a day of work. For the creation of the world was concluded in
   six days. For the motion of the sun from solstice to solstice is
   completed in six months--in the course of which, at one time the leaves
   fall, and at another plants bud and seeds come to maturity. And they
   say that the embryo is perfected exactly in the sixth month, that is,
   in one hundred and eighty days in addition to the two and a half, as
   Polybus the physician relates in his book On the Eighth Month, and
   Aristotle the philosopher in his book On Nature. Hence the
   Pythagoreans, as I think, reckon six the perfect number, from the
   creation of the world, according to the prophet, and call it Meseuthys
   [3456] and Marriage, from its being the middle of the even numbers,
   that is, of ten and two. For it is manifestly at an equal distance from
   both.

   And as marriage generates from male and female, so six is generated
   from the odd number three, which is called the masculine number, and
   the even number two, which is considered the feminine. For twice three
   are six.

   Such, again, is the number of the most general motions, according to
   which all origination takes place--up, down, to the right, to the left,
   forward, backward. Rightly, then, they reckon the number seven
   motherless and childless, interpreting the Sabbath, and figuratively
   expressing the nature of the rest, in which "they neither marry nor are
   given in marriage any more." [3457] For neither by taking from one
   number and adding to another of those within ten is seven produced; nor
   when added to any number within the ten does it make up any of them.

   And they called eight a cube, counting the fixed sphere along with the
   seven revolving ones, by which is produced "the great year," as a kind
   of period of recompense of what has been promised.

   Thus the Lord, who ascended the mountain, the fourth, [3458] becomes
   the sixth, and is illuminated all round with spiritual light, by laying
   bare the power proceeding from Him, as far as those selected to see
   were able to behold it, by the Seventh, the Voice, proclaimed to be the
   Son of God; in order that they, persuaded respecting Him, might have
   rest; while He by His birth, which was indicated by the sixth
   conspicuously marked, becoming the eighth, might appear to be God in a
   body of flesh, by displaying His power, being numbered indeed as a man,
   but being concealed as to who He was. For six is reckoned in the order
   of numbers, but the succession of the letters acknowledges the
   character which is not written. In this case, in the numbers
   themselves, each unit is preserved in its order up to seven and eight.
   But in the number of the characters, Zeta becomes six and Eta seven.

   And the character [3459] having somehow slipped into writing, should we
   follow it out thus, the seven became six, and the eight seven.

   Wherefore also man is said to have been made on the sixth day, who
   became faithful to Him who is the sign (to episemo [3460] ), so as
   straightway to receive the rest of the Lord's inheritance. Some such
   thing also is indicated by the sixth hour in the scheme of salvation,
   in which man was perfected. Further, of the eight, the intermediates
   are seven; and of the seven, the intervals are shown to be six. For
   that is another ground, in which seven glorifies eight, and "the
   heavens declare to the heavens the glory of God." [3461]

   The sensible types of these, then, are the sounds we pronounce. Thus
   the Lord Himself is called "Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
   end," [3462] "by whom all things were made, and without whom not even
   one thing was made." [3463] God's resting is not, then, as some
   conceive, that God ceased from doing. For, being good, if He should
   ever cease from doing good, then would He cease from being God, which
   it is sacrilege even to say. The resting is, therefore, the ordering
   that the order of created things should be preserved inviolate, and
   that each of the creatures should cease from the ancient disorder. For
   the creations on the different days followed in a most important
   succession; so that all things brought into existence might have honour
   from priority, created together in thought, but not being of equal
   worth. Nor was the creation of each signified by the voice, inasmuch as
   the creative work is said to have made them at once. For something must
   needs have been named first. Wherefore those things were announced
   first, from which came those that were second, all things being
   originated together from one essence by one power. For the will of God
   was one, in one identity. And how could creation take place in time,
   seeing time was born along with things which exist.

   And now the whole world of creatures born alive, and things that grow,
   revolves in sevens. The first-born princes of the angels, who have the
   greatest power, are seven. [3464] The mathematicians also say that the
   planets, which perform their course around the earth, are seven; by
   which the Chaldeans think that all which concerns mortal life is
   effected through sympathy, in consequence of which they also undertake
   to tell things respecting the future.

   And of the fixed stars, the Pleiades are seven. And the Bears, by the
   help of which agriculture and navigation are carried through, consist
   of seven stars. And in periods of seven days the moon undergoes its
   changes. In the first week she becomes half moon; in the second, full
   moon; and in the third, in her wane, again half moon; and in the fourth
   she disappears. Further, as Seleucus the mathematician lays down, she
   has seven phases. First, from being invisible she becomes
   crescent-shaped, then half moon, then gibbous and full; and in her wane
   again gibbous, and in like manner half moon and crescent-shaped.


   "On a seven-stringed lyre we shall sing new hymns,"

   writes a poet of note, teaching us that the ancient lyre was
   seven-toned. The organs of the senses situated on our face are also
   seven--two eyes, two passages of hearing, two nostrils, and the seventh
   the mouth.

   And that the changes in the periods of life take place by sevens, the
   Elegies of Solon teach thus:--


   "The child, while still an infant, in seven years,

   Produces and puts forth its fence of teeth;

   And when God seven years more completes,

   He shows of puberty's approach the signs;

   And in the third, the beard on growing cheek

   With down o'erspreads the bloom of changing skin;

   And in the fourth septenniad, at his best

   In strength, of manliness he shows the signs;

   And in the fifth, of marriage, now mature,

   And of posterity, the man bethinks;

   Nor does he yet desire vain works to see.

   The seventh and eighth septenniads see him now

   In mind and speech mature, till fifty years;

   And in the ninth he still has vigour left,

   But strength and body are for virtue great

   Less than of yore; when, seven years more, God brings

   To end, then not too soon may he submit to die."

   Again, in diseases the seventh day is that of the crisis; and the
   fourteenth, in which nature struggles against the causes of the
   diseases. And a myriad such instances are adduced by Hermippus of
   Berytus, in his book On the Number Seven, regarding it as holy. [3465]
   And the blessed David delivers clearly to those who know the mystic
   account of seven and eight, praising thus: "Our years were exercised
   like a spider. The days of our years in them are seventy years; but if
   in strength, eighty years. And that will be to reign." [3466] That,
   then, we may be taught that the world was originated, and not suppose
   that God made it in time, prophecy adds: "This is the book of the
   generation: also of the things in them, when they were created in the
   day that God made heaven and earth." [3467] For the expression "when
   they were created" intimates an indefinite and dateless production. But
   the expression "in the day that God made," that is, in and by which God
   made "all things," and "without which not even one thing was made,"
   points out the activity exerted by the Son. As David says, "This is the
   day which the Lord hath made; let us be glad and rejoice in it;" [3468]
   that is, in consequence of the knowledge [3469] imparted by Him, let us
   celebrate the divine festival; for the Word that throws light on things
   hidden, and by whom each created thing came into life and being, is
   called day.

   And, in fine, the Decalogue, by the letter Iota, [3470] signifies the
   blessed name, presenting Jesus, who is the Word.

        The Fifth Commandment.

   Now the fifth in order is the command on the honour of father and
   mother. And it clearly announces God as Father and Lord. Wherefore also
   it calls those who know Him sons and gods. The Creator of the universe
   is their Lord and Father; and the mother is not, as some say, the
   essence from which we sprang, nor, as others teach, the Church, but the
   divine knowledge and wisdom, as Solomon says, when he terms wisdom "the
   mother of the just," and says that it is desirable for its own sake.
   And the knowledge of all, again, that is lovely and venerable, proceeds
   from God through the Son.

        The Sixth Commandment.

   Then follows the command about murder. Now murder is a sure
   destruction. He, then, that wishes to extirpate the true doctrine of
   God and of immortality, in order to introduce falsehood, alleging
   either that the universe is not under Providence, or that the world is
   uncreated, or affirming anything against true doctrine, is most
   pernicious.

        The Seventh Commandment.

   This is followed by the command respecting adultery. Now it is
   adultery, if one, abandoning the ecclesiastical and true knowledge, and
   the persuasion respecting God, accedes to false and incongruous
   opinion, either by deifying any created object, or by making an idol of
   anything that exists not, so as to overstep, or rather step from,
   knowledge. And to the Gnostic false opinion is foreign, as the true
   belongs to him, and is allied with him. Wherefore the noble apostle
   calls one of the kinds of fornication, idolatry, [3471] in following
   the prophet, who says: "[My people] hath committed fornication with
   stock and stone. They have said to the stock, Thou art my father; and
   to the stone, Thou hast begotten me." [3472]

        The Eighth Commandment.

   And after this is the command respecting theft. As, then, he that
   steals what is another's, doing great wrong, rightly incurs ills
   suitable to his deserts; so also does he, who arrogates to himself
   divine works by the art of the statuary or the painter, and pronounces
   himself to be the maker of animals and plants. Likewise those, too, who
   mimic the true philosophy are thieves. Whether one be a husbandman or
   the father of a child, he is an agent in depositing seeds. But it is
   God who, ministering the growth and perfection of all things, brings
   the things produced to what is in accordance with their nature. But the
   most, in common also with the philosophers, attribute growth and
   changes to the stars as the primary cause, robbing the Father of the
   universe, as far as in them lies, of His tireless might.

   The elements, however, and the stars--that is, the administrative
   powers--are ordained for the accomplishment of what is essential to the
   administration, and are influenced and moved by what is commanded to
   them, in the way in which the Word of the Lord leads, since it is the
   nature of the divine power to work all things secretly. He,
   accordingly, who alleges that he has conceived or made anything which
   pertains to creation, will suffer the punishment of his impious
   audacity.

        The Tenth Commandment. [3473]

   And the tenth is the command respecting all lusts. As, then, he who
   entertains unbecoming desires is called to account; in the same way he
   is not allowed to desire things false, or to suppose that, of created
   objects, those that are animate have power of themselves, and that
   inanimate things can at all save or hurt. And should one say that an
   antidote cannot heal or hemlock kill, he is unwittingly deceived. For
   none of these operates except one makes use of the plant and the drug;
   just as the axe does not without one to cut with it, or a saw without
   one sawing with it. And as they do not work by themselves, but have
   certain physical qualities which accomplish their proper work by the
   exertion of the artisan; so also, by the universal providence of God,
   through the medium of secondary causes, the operative power is
   propagated in succession to individual objects.

      Chapter XVII.--Philosophy Conveys Only an Imperfect Knowledge of God.

   But, as appears, the philosophers of the Greeks, while naming God, do
   not know Him. But their philosophical speculations, according to
   Empedocles, "as passing over the tongue of the multitude, are poured
   out of mouths that know little of the whole." For as art changes the
   light of the sun into fire by passing it through a glass vessel full of
   water, so also philosophy, catching a spark from the divine Scripture,
   is visible in a few. Also, as all animals breathe the same air, some in
   one way, others in another, and to a different purpose; so also a
   considerable number of people occupy themselves with the truth, or
   rather with discourse concerning the truth. For they do not say aught
   respecting God, but expound Him by attributing their own affections to
   God. For they spend life in seeking the probable, not the true. But
   truth is not taught by imitation, but by instruction. For it is not
   that we may seem good [3474] that we believe in Christ, as it is not
   alone for the purpose of being seen, while in the sun, that we pass
   into the sun. But in the one case for the purpose of being warmed; and
   in the other, we are compelled to be Christians in order to be
   excellent and good. For the kingdom belongs pre-eminently to the
   violent, [3475] who, from investigation, and study, and discipline,
   reap this fruit, that they become kings.

   He, then, who imitates opinion shows also preconception. When then one,
   having got an inkling of the subject, kindles it within in his soul by
   desire and study, he sets everything in motion afterwards in order to
   know it. For that which one does not apprehend, neither does he desire
   it, nor does he embrace the advantage flowing from it. Subsequently,
   therefore, the Gnostic at last imitates the Lord, as far as allowed to
   men, having received a sort of quality akin to the Lord Himself, in
   order to assimilation to God. But those who are not proficient in
   knowledge cannot judge the truth by rule. It is not therefore possible
   to share in the gnostic contemplations, unless we empty ourselves of
   our previous notions. For the truth in regard to every object of
   intellect and of sense is thus simply universally declared. For
   instance, we may distinguish the truth of painting from that which is
   vulgar, and decorous music from licentious. There is, then, also a
   truth of philosophy as distinct from the other philosophies, and a true
   beauty as distinct from the spurious. It is not then the partial
   truths, of which truth is predicated, but the truth itself, that we are
   to investigate, not seeking to learn names. For what is to be
   investigated respecting God is not one thing, but ten thousand. There
   is a difference between declaring God, and declaring things about God.
   And to speak generally, in everything the accidents are to be
   distinguished from the essence.

   Suffice it for me to say, that the Lord of all is God; and I say the
   Lord of all absolutely, nothing being left by way of exception.

   Since, then, the forms of truth are two--the names and the things--some
   discourse of names, occupying themselves with the beauties of words:
   such are the philosophers among the Greeks. But we who are Barbarians
   have the things. Now it was not in vain that the Lord chose to make use
   of a mean form of body; so that no one praising the grace and admiring
   the beauty might turn his back on what was said, and attending to what
   ought to be abandoned, might be cut off from what is intellectual. We
   must therefore occupy ourselves not with the expression, but the
   meaning.

   To those, then, who are not gifted [3476] with the power of
   apprehension, and are not inclined to knowledge, the word is not
   entrusted; since also the ravens imitate human voices, having no
   understanding of the thing which they say. And intellectual
   apprehension depends on faith. Thus also Homer said:--


   "Father of men and gods," [3477] --

   knowing not who the Father is, or how He is Father.

   And as to him who has hands it is natural to grasp, and to him who has
   sound eyes to see the light; so it is the natural prerogative of him
   who has received faith to apprehend knowledge, if he desires, on "the
   foundation" laid, to work, and build up "gold, silver, precious
   stones." [3478]

   Accordingly he does not profess to wish to participate, but begins to
   do so. Nor does it belong to him to intend, but to be regal, and
   illuminated, and gnostic. Nor does it appertain to him to wish to grasp
   things in name, but in fact.

   For God, being good, on account of the principal part of the whole
   creation, seeing He wishes to save it, was induced to make the rest
   also; conferring on them at the beginning this first boon, that of
   existence. For that to be is far better than not to be, will be
   admitted by every one. Then, according to the capabilities of their
   nature, each one was and is made, advancing to that which is better.

   So there is no absurdity in philosophy having been given by Divine
   Providence as a preparatory discipline for the perfection which is by
   Christ; unless philosophy is ashamed at learning from Barbarian
   knowledge how to advance to truth. [3479] But if "the very hairs are
   numbered, and the most insignificant motions," how shall not philosophy
   be taken into account? For to Samson power was given in his hair, in
   order that he might perceive that the worthless arts that refer to the
   things in this life, which lie and remain on the ground after the
   departure of the soul, were not given without divine power.

   But it is said Providence, from above, from what is of prime
   importance, as from the head, reaches to all, "as the ointment," it is
   said, "which descends to Aaron's beard, and to the skirt of his
   garment" [3480] (that is, of the great High Priest, "by whom all things
   were made, and without whom not even one thing was made" [3481] ); not
   to the ornament of the body; for Philosophy is outside of the People,
   like raiment. [3482] The philosophers, therefore, who, trained to their
   own peculiar power of perception by the spirit of perception, when they
   investigate, not a part of philosophy, but philosophy absolutely,
   testify to the truth in a truth-loving and humble spirit; if in the
   case of good things said by those even who are of different sentiments
   they advance to understanding, through the divine administration, and
   the ineffable Goodness, which always, as far as possible, leads the
   nature of existences to that which is better. Then, by cultivating the
   acquaintance not of Greeks alone, but also of Barbarians, from the
   exercise common to their proper intelligence, they are conducted to
   Faith. And when they have embraced the foundation of truth, they
   receive in addition the power of advancing further to investigation.
   And thence they love to be learners, and aspiring after knowledge,
   haste to salvation.

   Thus Scripture says, that "the spirit of perception" was given to the
   artificers from God. [3483] And this is nothing else than
   Understanding, a faculty of the soul, capable of studying
   existences,--of distinguishing and comparing what succeeds as like and
   unlike,--of enjoining and forbidding, and of conjecturing the future.
   And it extends not to the arts alone, but even to philosophy itself.

   Why, then, is the serpent called wise? Because even in its wiles there
   may be found a connection, and distinction, and combination, and
   conjecturing of the future. And so very many crimes are concealed;
   because the wicked arrange for themselves so as by all means to escape
   punishment.

   And Wisdom being manifold, pervading the whole world, and all human
   affairs, varies its appellation in each case. When it applies itself to
   first causes, it is called Understanding (noesis). When, however, it
   confirms this by demonstrative reasoning, it is termed Knowledge, and
   Wisdom, and Science. When it is occupied in what pertains to piety, and
   receives without speculation the primal Word [3484] in consequence of
   the maintenance of the operation in it, it is called Faith. In the
   sphere of things of sense, establishing that which appears as being
   truest, it is Right Opinion. In operations, again, performed by skill
   of hand, it is Art. But when, on the other hand, without the study of
   primary causes, by the observation of similarities, and by
   transposition, it makes any attempt or combination, it is called
   Experiment. But belonging to it, and supreme and essential, is the Holy
   Spirit, which above all he who, in consequence of [divine] guidance,
   has believed, receives after strong faith. Philosophy, then, partaking
   of a more exquisite perception, as has been shown from the above
   statements, participates in Wisdom.

   Logical discussion, then, of intellectual subjects, with selection and
   assent, is called Dialectics; which establishes, by demonstration,
   allegations respecting truth, and demolishes the doubts brought
   forward.

   Those, then, who assert that philosophy did not come hither from God,
   all but say that God does not know each particular thing, and that He
   is not the cause of all good things; if, indeed, each of these belongs
   to the class of individual things. But nothing that exists could have
   subsisted at all, had God not willed. And if He willed, then philosophy
   is from God, He having willed it to be such as it is, for the sake of
   those who not otherwise than by its means would abstain from what is
   evil. For God knows all things--not those only which exist, but those
   also which shall be--and how each thing shall be. And foreseeing the
   particular movements, "He surveys all things, and hears all things,"
   seeing the soul naked within; and possesses from eternity the idea of
   each thing individually. And what applies to theatres, and to the parts
   of each object, in looking at, looking round, and taking in the whole
   in one view, applies also to God. For in one glance He views all things
   together, and each thing by itself; but not all things, by way of
   primary intent.

   Now, then, many things in life take their rise in some exercise of
   human reason, having received the kindling spark from God. For
   instance, health by medicine, and soundness of body through gymnastics,
   and wealth by trade, have their origin and existence in consequence of
   Divine Providence indeed, but in consequence, too, of human
   co-operation. Understanding also is from God.

   But God's will is especially obeyed by the free-will of good men. Since
   many advantages are common to good and bad men: yet they are
   nevertheless advantageous only to men of goodness and probity, for
   whose sake God created them. For it was for the use of good men that
   the influence which is in God's gifts was originated. Besides, the
   thoughts of virtuous men are produced through the inspiration [3485] of
   God; the soul being disposed in the way it is, and the divine will
   being conveyed to human souls, particular divine ministers contributing
   to such services. For regiments of angels are distributed over the
   nations and cities. [3486] And, perchance, some are assigned to
   individuals. [3487]

   The Shepherd, then, cares for each of his sheep; and his closest
   inspection is given to those who are excellent in their natures, and
   are capable of being most useful. Such are those fit to lead and teach,
   in whom the action of Providence is conspicuously seen; whenever either
   by instruction, or government, or administration, God wishes to
   benefit. But He wishes at all times. Wherefore He moves those who are
   adapted to useful exertion in the things which pertain to virtue, and
   peace, and beneficence. But all that is characterized by virtue
   proceeds from virtue, and leads back to virtue. And it is given either
   in order that men may become good, or that those who are so may make
   use of their natural advantages. For it co-operates both in what is
   general and what is particular. How absurd, then, is it, to those who
   attribute disorder and wickedness to the devil, to make him the
   bestower of philosophy, a virtuous thing! For he is thus all but made
   more benignant to the Greeks, in respect of making men good, than the
   divine providence and mind.

   Again, I reckon it is the part of law and of right reason to assign to
   each one what is appropriate to him, and belongs to him, and falls to
   him. For as the lyre is only for the harper, and the flute for the
   flute-player; so good things are the possessions of good men. As the
   nature of the beneficent is to do good, as it is of the fire to warm,
   and the light to give light, and a good man will not do evil, or light
   produce darkness, or fire cold; so, again, vice cannot do aught
   virtuous. For its activity is to do evil, as that of darkness to dim
   the eyes.

   Philosophy is not, then, the product of vice, since it makes men
   virtuous; it follows, then, that it is the work of God, whose work it
   is solely to do good. And all things given by God are given and
   received well.

   Further, if the practice of philosophy does not belong to the wicked,
   but was accorded to the best of the Greeks, it is clear also from what
   source it was bestowed--manifestly from Providence, which assigns to
   each what is befitting in accordance with his deserts." [3488]

   Rightly, then, to the Jews belonged the Law, and to the Greeks
   Philosophy, until the Advent; and after that came the universal calling
   to be a peculiar people of righteousness, through the teaching which
   flows from faith, brought together by one Lord, the only God of both
   Greeks and Barbarians, or rather of the whole race of men. We have
   often called by the name philosophy that portion of truth attained
   through philosophy, although but partial. [3489]

   Now, too what is good in the arts as arts, [3490] have their beginning
   from God. For as the doing of anything artistically is embraced in the
   rules of art, so also acting sagaciously is classed under the head of
   sagacity (phronesis). Now sagacity is virtue, and it is its function to
   know other things, but much more especially what belongs to itself. And
   Wisdom (Sophia) being power, is nothing but the knowledge of good
   things, divine and human.

   But "the earth is God's, and the fulness thereof," [3491] says the
   Scripture, teaching that good things come from God to men; it being
   through divine power and might that the distribution of them comes to
   the help of man.

   Now the modes of all help and communication from one to another are
   three. One is, by attending to another, as the master of gymnastics, in
   training the boy. The second is, by assimilation, as in the case of one
   who exhorts another to benevolence by practising it before. The one
   co-operates with the learner, and the other benefits him who receives.
   The third mode is that by command, when the gymnastic master, no longer
   training the learner, nor showing in his own person the exercise for
   the boy to imitate, prescribes the exercise by name to him, as already
   proficient in it.

   The Gnostic, accordingly, having received from God the power to be of
   service, benefits some by disciplining them, by bestowing attention on
   them; others, by exhorting them, by assimilation; and others, by
   training and teaching them, by command. And certainly he himself is
   equally benefited by the Lord. Thus, then, the benefit that comes from
   God to men becomes known--angels at the same time lending
   encouragement. [3492] For by angels, whether seen or not, the divine
   power bestows good things. Such was the mode adopted in the advent of
   the Lord. And sometimes also the power "breathes" in men's thoughts and
   reasonings, and "puts in" their hearts "strength" and a keener
   perception, and furnishes "prowess" and "boldness of alacrity" [3493]
   both for researches and deeds.

   But exposed for imitation and assimilation are truly admirable and holy
   examples of virtue in the actions put on record. Further, the
   department of action is most conspicuous both in the testaments of the
   Lord, and in the laws in force among the Greeks, and also in the
   precepts of philosophy.

   And to speak comprehensively, all benefit appertaining to life, in its
   highest reason, proceeding from the Sovereign God, the Father who is
   over all, is consummated by the Son, who also on this account "is the
   Saviour of all men," says the apostle, "but especially of those who
   believe." [3494] But in respect of its immediate reason, it is from
   those next to each, in accordance with the command and injunction of
   Him who is nearest the First Cause, that is, the Lord.

      Chapter XVIII.--The Use of Philosophy to the Gnostic.

        Greek philosophy the recreation of the Gnostic.

   Now our Gnostic always occupies himself with the things of highest
   importance. But if at any time he has leisure and time for relaxation
   from what is of prime consequence, he applies himself to Hellenic
   philosophy in preference to other recreation, feasting on it as a kind
   of dessert at supper. [3495] Not that he neglects what is superior; but
   that he takes this in addition, as long as proper, for the reasons I
   mentioned above. But those who give their mind to the unnecessary and
   superfluous points of philosophy, and addict themselves to wrangling
   sophisms alone, abandon what is necessary and most essential, pursuing
   plainly the shadows of words.

   It is well indeed to know all. But the man whose soul is destitute of
   the ability to reach to acquaintance with many subjects of study, will
   select the principal and better subjects alone. For real science
   (episteme, which we affirm the Gnostic alone possesses) is a sure
   comprehension (katalepsis), leading up through true and sure reasons to
   the knowledge (gnosis) of the cause. And he, who is acquainted with
   what is true respecting any one subject, becomes of course acquainted
   with what is false respecting it.

        Philosophy necessary.

   For truly it appears to me to be a proper point for discussion, Whether
   we ought to philosophize: for its terms are consistent.

   But if we are not to philosophize, what then? (For no one can condemn a
   thing without first knowing it): the consequence, even in that case, is
   that we must philosophize. [3496]

        First of all, idols are to be rejected.

   Such, then, being the case, the Greeks ought by the Law and the
   Prophets to learn to worship one God only, the only Sovereign; then to
   be taught by the apostle, "but to us an idol is nothing in the world,"
   [3497] since nothing among created things can be a likeness of God; and
   further, to be taught that none of those images which they worship can
   be similitudes: for the race of souls is not in form such as the Greeks
   fashion their idols. For souls are invisible; not only those that are
   rational, but those also of the other animals. And their bodies never
   become parts of the souls themselves, but organs--partly as seats,
   partly as vehicles--and in other cases possessions in various ways. But
   it is not possible to copy accurately even the likenesses of the
   organs; since, were it so, one might model the sun, as it is seen, and
   take the likeness of the rainbow in colours.

   After abandoning idols, then, they will hear the Scripture, "Unless
   your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
   Pharisees" [3498] (who justified themselves in the way of abstinence
   from what was evil),--so as, along with such perfection as they
   evinced, and "the loving of your neighbour," to be able also to do
   good, you shall not "be kingly." [3499]

   For intensification of the righteousness which is according to the law
   shows the Gnostic. So one who is placed in the head, which is that
   which rules its own body--and who advances to the summit of faith,
   which is the knowledge (gnosis) itself, for which all the organs of
   perception exist--will likewise obtain the highest inheritance.

   The primacy of knowledge the apostle shows to those capable of
   reflection, in writing to those Greeks of Corinth, in the following
   terms: "But having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be
   magnified in you according to our rule abundantly, to preach the Gospel
   beyond you." [3500] He does not mean the extension of his preaching
   locally: for he says also that in Achaia faith abounded; and it is
   related also in the Acts of the Apostles that he preached the word in
   Athens. [3501] But he teaches that knowledge (gnosis), which is the
   perfection of faith, goes beyond catechetical instruction, in
   accordance with the magnitude of the Lord's teaching and the rule of
   the Church. [3502] Wherefore also he proceeds to add, "And if I am rude
   in speech, yet I am not in knowledge." [3503]

        Whence is the knowledge of truth?

   But let those who vaunt on account of having apprehended the truth tell
   us from whom they boast of having heard it. They will not say from God,
   but will admit that it was from men. And if so, it is either from
   themselves that they have learned it lately, as some of them arrogantly
   boast, or from others like them. But human teachers, speaking of God,
   are not reliable, as men. For he that is man cannot speak worthily the
   truth concerning God: the feeble and mortal [cannot speak worthily] of
   the Unoriginated and Incorruptible--the work, of the Workman. Then he
   who is incapable of speaking what is true respecting himself, is he not
   much less reliable in what concerns God? For just as far as man is
   inferior to God in power, so much feebler is man's speech than Him;
   although he do not declare God, but only speak about God and the divine
   word. For human speech is by nature feeble, and incapable of uttering
   God. I do not say His name. For to name it is common, not to
   philosophers only, but also to poets. Nor [do I say] His essence; for
   this is impossible, but the power and the works of God.

   Those even who claim God as their teacher, with difficulty attain to a
   conception of God, grace aiding them to the attainment of their modicum
   of knowledge; accustomed as they are to contemplate the will [of God]
   by the will, and the Holy Spirit by the Holy Spirit. "For the Spirit
   searches the deep things of God. But the natural man receiveth not the
   things of the Spirit." [3504]

   The only wisdom, therefore, is the God-taught wisdom we possess; on
   which depend all the sources of wisdom, which make conjectures at the
   truth.

        Intimations of the Teacher's advent

   Assuredly of the coming of the Lord, who has taught us, to men, there
   were a myriad indicators, heralds, preparers, precursors, from the
   beginning, from the foundation of the world, intimating beforehand by
   deeds and words, prophesying that He would come, and where, and how,
   what should be the signs. From afar certainly Law and Prophecy kept Him
   in view beforehand. And then the precursor pointed Him out as present.
   After whom the heralds point out by their teaching the virtue of His
   manifestation.

        Universal diffusion of the Gospel a contrast to philosophy.

   The philosophers, however, chose to [teach philosophy] to the Greeks
   alone, [3505] and not even to all of them; but Socrates to Plato, and
   Plato to Xenocrates, Aristotle to Theophrastus, and Zeno to Cleanthes,
   who persuaded their own followers alone.

   But the word of our Teacher remained not in Judea alone, as philosophy
   did in Greece; but was diffused over the whole world, over every
   nation, and village, and town, bringing already over to the truth whole
   houses, and each individual of those who heard it by him himself, and
   not a few of the philosophers themselves.

   And if any one ruler whatever prohibit the Greek philosophy, it
   vanishes forthwith. [3506] But our doctrine on its very first
   proclamation was prohibited by kings and tyrants together, as well as
   particular rulers and governors, with all their mercenaries, and in
   addition by innumerable men, warring against us, and endeavouring as
   far as they could to exterminate it. But it flourishes the more. For it
   dies not, as human doctrine dies, nor fades as a fragile gift. For no
   gift of God is fragile. But it remains unchecked, though prophesied as
   destined to be persecuted to the end. Thus Plato writes of poetry: "A
   poet is a light and a sacred thing, and cannot write poetry till he be
   inspired and lose his senses." And Democritus similarly: "Whatever
   things a poet writes with divine afflatus, and with a sacred spirit,
   are very beautiful." And we know what sort of things poets say. And
   shall no one be amazed at the prophets of God Almighty becoming the
   organs of the divine voice?

   Having then moulded, as it were, a statue of the Gnostic, we have now
   shown who he is; indicating in outline, as it were, both the greatness
   and beauty of his character. What he is as to the study of physical
   phenomena shall be shown afterwards, when we begin to treat of the
   creation of the world.

   Better do violence to idiom, like our English Bible ("men and

   In addition to the note in loc., it may be well to mention the Stromata
   (book i. cap. xv. p. 316), as another place where this name occurs. The
   learned Calmet (Works, tom. ix. p. 121), in his Dict. Critic., has a
   valuable statement as to the difficulties connected with this name and
   the probability that there were two so called, who have been confused
   in the citations and references of authors.

      III.

   (Egyptians, cap. iv. [114]p. 488.)

   The paradoxical genius of Warburton ought not to dissuade us from
   enjoying the amusement and instruction to be found in his Divine
   Legation. In many respects he reminds me of this great Alexandrian
   Father, and they are worthy of being studied together. Let me instance,
   in connection with this subject, the second book, e. g. p. 151, on
   Metempsychosis (Hurd's Edition, vol. ii. 1811).

      IV.

   (Egyptian Women, book vi. cap. iv. [115]p. 488.)

   "Last, about women," says our author; and one would infer least. But
   Rawlinson (Herod., vol. ii. p. 47, ed. New York) has a long and learned
   note on this subject. "Queens made offerings with the kings, and the
   monuments show that an order of women were employed in the service of
   the gods." ... Then he says, "A sort of monastic institution seems to
   have originated in Egypt at an early time, and to have been imitated
   afterwards, when the real conventual system was set on foot by the
   Christians, in the same country." This may be worthy of being borne in
   mind, when we come to the coenobitic life of the Thebaid, which lies,
   indeed, beyond the limits of our ante-Nicene researches. But
   persecution had already driven Christians to the desert; and the
   ascetic type of piety, with which the age and its necessities imprinted
   the souls of many devout women, may have led them at a very early
   period to the "imitation" of which Rawlinson speaks. The "widows"
   recognised by the ante-Nicene canons, would naturally become the
   founders of "widows' houses," such as are to be seen among the pious
   Moravians in our times. (See Bunsen, Hippol., iii. p. 81.)

      V.

   (Philosophy, cap. vii. [116]p. 493.)

   In justice to Clement's eulogies of philosophy, we must constantly bear
   in mind his reiterated definitions. We have here a very important
   outline of his Christian Eclecticism, which, so far from clashing with
   St. Paul's scornful references to Gentile wisdom, seems to me in
   absolute correspondence with his reference to "science falsely so
   called" (1 Tim. vi. 20). So, when the apostle identifies philosophy
   with "the rudiments of the world," he adds, "and not after Christ."
   Now, Clement's eclectic system yokes all true philosophy to the
   chariot-wheels of the Messiah, as in this instance; making all true
   science hinge upon "the knowledge of the Son of God." How these
   chapters shine in contrast even with Plato.

      VI.

   (Numbers, cap. xi. [117]p. 499.)

   The marvellous system of numbers which runs through all revelation, and
   which gives us the name Palmoni (English margin) in a remarkable
   passage of Dan. viii. 13, has lately excited fresh interest among the
   learned in England and America. Doubtless the language of St. John
   (Rev. xiii. 18), "Here is wisdom," etc., influenced the early Church in
   what seems to us purely fanciful conjectures and combinations like
   these. Two unpretending little books have lately struck me as quite in
   the spirit of the Ante-Nicene Fathers: The Number Counted, and the Name
   Counted, by J. A. Upjohn (Appleton, Wis., 1883).

      VII.

   (The Gnostic, cap. xi. [118]p. 501.)

   The Gnostic "conjectures things future," i.e., by the Scriptures. "He
   shall show you things to come," said the Divine Master, speaking of the
   Blessed Comforter. To what extent did these ancients, in their esoteric
   conjectures, anticipate the conversion of the empire, and the evils
   that were to follow? This they could not publish; but the inquiry
   deserves thought, and there are dues for inquirers.

      VIII.

   (Ultimate Issues, cap. xiii. [119]p. 504.)

   With reference to the choice of Judas to be an apostle, and like
   mysteries, this seems to me a bit of calm philosophy, worthy of the
   childlike faith of the early Christians. I confess great obligations to
   a neglected American author, with reference to such discussions (see
   Bledsoe, Theodicy, New York, 1854).

      IX.

   (Enigmas, cap. xv. [120]p. 510.)

   We are often troubled by this Oriental tendency to teach by myth and
   mysteries; but the text here quoted from the Proverbs, goes far to show
   that it is rooted in human nature, and that God himself has
   condescended to adopt it. Like every gift of God, it is subject to
   almost inevitable corruption and abuse.

      X.

   (Omissions, cap. xvi. [121]p. 515.)

   The omissions in Clement's Decalogue are worthy of remark, and I can
   only account for them by supposing a defective text. Kaye might have
   said more on the subject; but he suggests this as the solution of the
   difficulty, when he says (p. 201), "As the text now stands, Clement
   interprets only eight out of the ten."

   P.S.--I have foreborne to say anything on "the descent into hell," in
   my annotations (on cap. vi.), for obvious reasons of propriety; but,
   for an entire system of references to the whole subject, I name Ezra
   Abbot's Catalogue, appended to Alger's History, etc. (Philadelphia,
   1864.)

      Chapter I.--The Gnostic a True Worshipper of God, and Unjustly Calumniated
      by Unbelievers as an Atheist.

   It is now time to show the Greeks that the Gnostic alone is truly
   pious; so that the philosophers, learning of what description the true
   Christian is, may condemn their own stupidity in rashly and
   inconsiderately persecuting the [Christian] name, and without reason
   calling those impious who know the true God. And clearer arguments must
   be employed, I reckon, with the philosophers, so that they may be able,
   from the exercise they have already had through their own training, to
   understand, although they have not yet shown themselves worthy to
   partake of the power of believing.

   The prophetic sayings we shall not at present advert to, as we are to
   avail ourselves of the Scriptures subsequently at the proper places.
   But we shall point out summarily the points indicated by them, in our
   delineation of Christianity, so that by taking the Scriptures at once
   (especially as they do not yet comprehend their utterances), we may not
   interrupt the continuity of the discourse. But after pointing out the
   things indicated, proofs shall be shown in abundance to those who have
   believed.

   But if the assertions made by us appear to certain of the multitude to
   be different from the Scriptures of the Lord, let it be known that it
   is from that source that they have breath and life; and taking their
   rise from them, they profess to adduce the sense only, not the words.
   For further treatment, not being seasonable, will rightly appear
   superfluous. Thus, not to look at what is urgent would be excessively
   indolent and defective; and "blessed, in truth, are they who,
   investigating the testimonies of the Lord, shall seek Him with their
   whole heart." [3507] And the law and the prophets witness of the Lord.

   It is, then, our purpose to prove that the Gnostic alone is holy and
   pious, and worships the true God in a manner worthy of Him; and that
   worship meet for God is followed by loving and being loved by God. He
   accordingly judges all excellence to be honourable according to its
   worth; and judges that among the objects perceived by our senses, we
   are to esteem rulers, and parents, and every one advanced in years; and
   among subjects of instruction, the most ancient philosophy and primeval
   prophecy; and among intellectual ideas, what is oldest in origin, the
   timeless and unoriginated First Principle, and Beginning of
   existences--the Son--from whom we are to learn the remoter Cause, the
   Father, of the universe, the most ancient and the most beneficent of
   all; not capable of expression by the voice, but to be reverenced with
   reverence, and silence, and holy wonder, and supremely venerated;
   declared by the Lord, as far as those who learned were capable of
   comprehending, and understood by those chosen by the Lord to
   acknowledge; "whose senses," says the apostle, "were exercised." [3508]

   The service of God, then, in the case of the Gnostic, is his soul's
   continual study [3509] and occupation, bestowed on the Deity in
   ceaseless love. For of the service bestowed on men, one kind is that
   whose aim is improvement, the other ministerial. The improvement of the
   body is the object of the medical art, of the soul of philosophy.
   Ministerial service is rendered to parents by children, to rulers by
   subjects.

   Similarly, also, in the Church, the elders attend to the department
   which has improvement for its object; and the deacons to the
   ministerial. In both these ministries the angels [3510] serve God, in
   the management of earthly affairs; and the Gnostic himself ministers to
   God, and exhibits to men the scheme of improvement, in the way in which
   he has been appointed to discipline men for their amendment. For he is
   alone pious that serves God rightly and unblameably in human affairs.
   For as that treatment of plants is best through which their fruits are
   produced and gathered in, through knowledge and skill in husbandry,
   affording men the benefit accruing from them; so the piety of the
   Gnostic, taking to itself the fruits of the men who by his means have
   believed, when not a few attain to knowledge and are saved by it,
   achieves by his skill the best harvest. And as Godliness (theoprepeia)
   is the habit which preserves what is becoming to God, the godly man is
   the only lover of God, and such will he be who knows what is becoming,
   both in respect of knowledge and of the life which must be lived by
   him, who is destined to be divine (theo), and is already being
   assimilated to God. So then he is in the first place a lover of God.
   For as he who honours his father is a lover of his father, so he who
   honours God is a lover of God.

   Thus also it appears to me that there are three effects of gnostic
   power: the knowledge of things; second, the performance of whatever the
   Word suggests; and the third, the capability of delivering, in a way
   suitable to God, the secrets veiled in the truth.

   He, then, who is persuaded that God is omnipotent, and has learned the
   divine mysteries from His only-begotten Son, how can he be an atheist
   (athpeos)? For he is an atheist who thinks that God does not exist. And
   he is superstitious who dreads the demons; who deifies all things, both
   wood and stone; and reduces to bondage spirit, and man who possesses
   the life of reason. [3511]

      Chapter II.--The Son the Ruler and Saviour of All.

   To know [3512] God is, then, the first step of faith; then, through
   confidence in the teaching of the Saviour, to consider the doing of
   wrong in any way as not suitable to the knowledge of God.

   So the best thing on earth is the most pious man; and the best thing in
   heaven, the nearer in place and purer, is an angel, the partaker of the
   eternal and blessed life. But the nature of the Son, which is nearest
   to Him who is alone the Almighty One, is the most perfect, and most
   holy, and most potent, and most princely, and most kingly, and most
   beneficent. This is the highest excellence, which orders all things in
   accordance with the Father's will, and holds the helm of the universe
   in the best way, with unwearied and tireless power, working all things
   in which it operates, keeping in view its hidden designs. For from His
   own point of view the Son of God is never displaced; not being divided,
   not severed, not passing from place to place; being always everywhere,
   and being contained nowhere; complete mind, the complete paternal
   light; all eyes, seeing all things, hearing all things, knowing all
   things, by His power scrutinizing the powers. To Him is placed in
   subjection all the host of angels and gods; He, the paternal Word,
   exhibiting [3513] a the holy administration for Him who put [all] in
   subjection to Him.

   Wherefore also all men are His; some through knowledge, and others not
   yet so; and some as friends, some as faithful servants, some as
   servants merely. This is the Teacher, who trains the Gnostic by
   mysteries, and the believer by good hopes, and the hard of heart by
   corrective discipline through sensible operation. Thence His providence
   is in private, in public, and everywhere.

   And that He whom we call Saviour and Lord is the Son of God, the
   prophetic Scriptures explicitly prove. So the Lord of all, of Greeks
   and of Barbarians, persuades those who are willing. For He does not
   compel him [3514] who (through choosing and fulfilling, from Him, what
   pertains to laying hold of it the hope) is able to receive salvation
   from Him.

   It is He who also gave philosophy to the Greeks by means of the
   inferior angels. For by an ancient and divine order the angels are
   distributed among the nations. [3515] But the glory of those who
   believe is "the Lord's portion." For either the Lord does not care for
   all men; and this is the case either because He is unable (which is not
   to be thought, for it would be a proof of weakness), or because He is
   unwilling, which is not the attribute of a good being. And He who for
   our sakes assumed flesh capable of suffering, is far from being
   luxuriously indolent. Or He does care for all, which is befitting for
   Him who has become Lord of all. For He is Saviour; not [the Saviour] of
   some, and of others not. But in proportion to the adaptation possessed
   by each, He has dispensed His beneficence both to Greeks and
   Barbarians, even to those of them that were predestinated, and in due
   time called, the faithful and elect. Nor can He who called all equally,
   and assigned special honours to those who have believed in a specially
   excellent way, ever envy any. Nor can He who is the Lord of all, and
   serves above all the will of the good and almighty Father, ever be
   hindered by another. But neither does envy touch the Lord, who without
   beginning was impassible; nor are the things of men such as to be
   envied by the Lord. But it is another, he whom passion hath touched,
   who envies. And it cannot be said that it is from ignorance that the
   Lord is not willing to save humanity, because He knows not how each one
   is to be cared for. For ignorance applies not to the God who, before
   the foundation of the world, was the counsellor of the Father. For He
   was the Wisdom "in which" the Sovereign God "delighted." [3516] For the
   Son is the power of God, as being the Father's most ancient Word before
   the production of all things, and His Wisdom. He is then properly
   called the Teacher of the beings formed by Him. Nor does He ever
   abandon care for men, by being drawn aside from pleasure, who, having
   assumed flesh, which by nature is susceptible of suffering, trained it
   to the condition of impassibility.

   And how is He Saviour and Lord, if not the Saviour and Lord of all? But
   He is the Saviour of those who have believed, because of their wishing
   to know; and the Lord of those who have not believed, till, being
   enabled to confess him, they obtain the peculiar and appropriate boon
   which comes by Him.

   Now the energy of the Lord has a reference to the Almighty; and the Son
   is, so to speak, an energy of the Father. Therefore, a hater of man,
   the Saviour can never be; who, for His exceeding love to human flesh,
   despising not its susceptibility to suffering, but investing Himself
   with it, came for the common salvation of men; for the faith of those
   who have chosen it, is common. Nay more, He will never neglect His own
   work, because man alone of all the other living creatures was in his
   creation endowed with a conception of God. Nor can there be any other
   better and more suitable government for men than that which is
   appointed by God.

   It is then always proper for the one who is superior by nature to be
   over the inferior, and for him who is capable of managing aught well to
   have the management of it assigned to him. Now that which truly rules
   and presides is the Divine Word and His providence, which inspects all
   things, and despises the care of nothing belonging to it.

   Those, then, who choose to belong to Him, are those who are perfected
   through faith. He, the Son, is, by the will of the Almighty Father, the
   cause of all good things, being the first efficient cause of motion--a
   power incapable of being apprehended by sensation. For what He was, was
   not seen by those who, through the weakness of the flesh, were
   incapable of taking in [the reality]. But, having assumed sensitive
   flesh, He came to show man what was possible through obedience to the
   commandments. Being, then, the Father's power, He easily prevails in
   what He wishes, leaving not even the minutest point of His
   administration unattended to. For otherwise the whole would not have
   been well executed by Him.

   But, as I think, characteristic of the highest power is the accurate
   scrutiny of all the parts, reaching even to the minutest, terminating
   in the first Administrator of the universe, who by the will of the
   Father directs the salvation of all; some overlooking, who are set
   under others, who are set over them, till you come to the great High
   Priest. For on one original first Principle, which acts according to
   the [Father's] will, the first and the second and the third depend.
   Then at the highest extremity of the visible world is the blessed band
   of angels; [3517] and down to ourselves there are ranged, some under
   others, those who, from One and by One, both are saved and save.

   As, then, the minutest particle of steel is moved by the spirit of the
   Heraclean stone, [3518] when diffused [3519] over many steel rings; so
   also, attracted by the Holy Spirit, the virtuous are added by affinity
   to the first abode, and the others in succession down to the last. But
   those who are bad from infirmity, having fallen from vicious
   insatiableness into a depraved state, neither controlling nor
   controlled, rush round and round, whirled about by the passions, and
   fall down to the ground.

   For this was the law from the first, that virtue should be the object
   of voluntary choice. Wherefore also the commandments, according to the
   Law, and before the Law, not given to the upright (for the law is not
   appointed for a righteous man [3520] ), ordained that he should receive
   eternal life and the blessed prize, who chose them.

   But, on the other hand, they allowed him who had been delighted with
   vice to consort with the objects of his choice; and, on the other hand,
   that the soul, which is ever improving in the acquisition [3521] of
   virtue and the increase of righteousness, should obtain a better place
   in the universe, as tending in each step of advancement towards the
   habit of impassibility, till "it come to a perfect man," [3522] to the
   excellence at once of knowledge and of inheritance.

   These salutary revolutions, in accordance with the order of change, are
   distinguished both by times, and places, and honours, and cognitions,
   and heritages, and ministries, according to the particular order of
   each change, up to the transcendent and continual contemplation of the
   Lord in eternity.

   Now that which is lovable leads, to the contemplation of itself, each
   one who, from love of knowledge, applies himself entirely to
   contemplation. Wherefore also the Lord, drawing the commandments, both
   the first which He gave, and the second, from one fountain, neither
   allowed those who were before the law to be without law, nor permitted
   those who were unacquainted with the principles of the Barbarian
   philosophy to be without restraint. For, having furnished the one with
   the commandments, and the other with philosophy, He shut up unbelief to
   the Advent. Whence [3523] every one who believes not is without excuse.
   For by a different process of advancement, both Greek and Barbarian, He
   leads to the perfection which is by faith. [3524]

   And if any one of the Greeks, passing over the preliminary training of
   the Hellenic philosophy, proceeds directly to the true teaching, he
   distances others, though an unlettered man, by choosing [3525] the
   compendious process of salvation by faith to perfection.

   Everything, then, which did not hinder a man's choice from being free,
   He made and rendered auxiliary to virtue, in order that there might be
   revealed somehow or other, even to those capable of seeing but dimly,
   the one only almighty, good God--from eternity to eternity saving by
   His Son.

   And, on the other hand, He is in no respect whatever the cause of evil.
   For all things are arranged with a view to the salvation of the
   universe by the Lord of the universe, both generally and particularly.
   It is then the function of the righteousness of salvation to improve
   everything as far as practicable. For even minor matters are arranged
   with a view to the salvation of that which is better, and for an abode
   suitable for people's character. Now everything that is virtuous
   changes for the better; having as the proper [3526] cause of change the
   free choice of knowledge, which the soul has in its own power. But
   necessary corrections, through the goodness of the great overseeing
   Judge, both by the attendant angels, and by various acts of
   anticipative judgment, and by the perfect judgment, compel egregious
   sinners to repent.

     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter III.--The Gnostic Aims at the Nearest Likeness Possible to God and
      His Son.

   Now I pass over other things in silence, glorifying the Lord. But I
   affirm that gnostic souls, that surpass in the grandeur of
   contemplation the mode of life of each of the holy ranks, among whom
   the blessed abodes of the gods are allotted by distribution, reckoned
   holy among the holy, transferred entire from among the entire, reaching
   places better than the better places, embracing the divine vision not
   in mirrors or by means of mirrors, but in the transcendently clear and
   absolutely pure insatiable vision which is the privilege of intensely
   loving souls, holding festival through endless ages, remain honoured
   with the indentity of all excellence. Such is the vision attainable by
   "the pure in heart." [3527] This is the function of the Gnostic, who
   has been perfected, to have converse with God through the great High
   Priest, being made like the Lord, up to the measure of his capacity, in
   the whole service of God, which tends to the salvation of men, through
   care of the beneficence which has us for its object; and on the other
   side through worship, through teaching and through beneficence in
   deeds. The Gnostic even forms and creates himself; and besides also,
   he, like to God, adorns those who hear him; assimilating as far as
   possible the moderation which, arising from practice, tends to
   impassibility, to Him who by nature possesses impassibility; and
   especially having uninterrupted converse and fellowship with the Lord.
   Mildness, I think, and philanthropy, and eminent piety, are the rules
   of gnostic assimilation. I affirm that these virtues "are a sacrifice
   acceptable in the sight of God;" [3528] Scripture alleging that "the
   humble heart with right knowledge is the holocaust of God;" [3529] each
   man who is admitted to holiness being illuminated in order to
   indissoluble union.

   For "to bring themselves into captivity," and to slay themselves,
   putting to death "the old man, who is through lusts corrupt," and
   raising the new man from death, "from the old conversation," by
   abandoning the passions, and becoming free of sin, both the Gospel and
   the apostle enjoin. [3530]

   It was this, consequently, which the Law intimated, by ordering the
   sinner to be cut off, and translated from death to life, to the
   impassibility that is the result of faith; which the teachers of the
   Law, not comprehending, inasmuch as they regarded the law as
   contentious, they have given a handle to those who attempt idly to
   calumniate the Law. And for this reason we rightly do not sacrifice to
   God, who, needing nothing, supplies all men with all things; but we
   glorify Him who gave Himself in sacrifice for us, we also sacrificing
   ourselves; from that which needs nothing to that which needs nothing,
   and to that which is impassible from that which is impassible. For in
   our salvation alone God delights. We do not therefore, and with reason
   too, offer sacrifice to Him who is not overcome by pleasures, inasmuch
   as the fumes of the smoke stop far beneath, and do not even reach the
   thickest clouds; but those they reach are far from them. The Deity
   neither is, then, in want of aught, nor loves pleasure, or gain, or
   money, being full, and supplying all things to everything that has
   received being and has wants. And neither by sacrifices nor offerings,
   nor on the other hand by glory and honour, is the Deity won over; nor
   is He influenced by any such things; but He appears only to excellent
   and good men, who will never betray justice for threatened fear, nor by
   the promise of considerable gifts.

   But those who have not seen the self-determination of the human soul,
   and its incapability of being treated as a slave in what respects the
   choice of life, being disgusted at what is done through rude injustice,
   do not think that there is a God. On a par with these in opinion, are
   they who, falling into licentiousness in pleasures, and grievous pains,
   and unlooked-for accidents, and bidding defiance to events, say that
   there is no God, or that, though existing, He does not oversee all
   things. And others there are, who are persuaded that those they reckon
   gods are capable of being prevailed upon by sacrifices and gifts,
   favouring, so to speak, their profligacies; and will not believe that
   He is the only true God, who exists in the invariableness of righteous
   goodness.

   The Gnostic, then, is pious, who cares first for himself, then for his
   neighbours, that they may become very good. For the son gratifies a
   good father, by showing himself good and like his father; and in like
   manner the subject, the governor. For believing and obeying are in our
   own power.

   But should any one suppose the cause of evils to be the weakness of
   matter, and the involuntary impulses of ignorance, and (in his
   stupidity) irrational necessities; he who has become a Gnostic has
   through instruction superiority over these, as if they were wild
   beasts; and in imitation of the divine plan, he does good to such as
   are willing, as far as he can. And if ever placed in authority, like
   Moses, he will rule for the salvation of the governed; and will tame
   wildness and faithlessness, by recording honour for the most excellent,
   and punishment for the wicked, in accordance with reason for the sake
   of discipline.

   For pre-eminently a divine image, resembling God, is the soul of a
   righteous man; in which, through obedience to the commands, as in a
   consecrated spot, is enclosed and enshrined the Leader of mortals and
   of immortals, King and Parent of what is good, who is truly law, and
   right, and eternal Word, being the one Saviour individually to each,
   and in common to all.

   He is the true Only-begotten, the express image of the glory of the
   universal King and Almighty Father, who impresses on the Gnostic the
   seal of the perfect contemplation, according to His own image; so that
   there is now a third divine image, made as far as possible like the
   Second Cause, the Essential Life, through which we live the true life;
   the Gnostic, as we regard him, being described as moving amid things
   sure and wholly immutable.

   Ruling, then, over himself and what belongs to him, and possessing a
   sure grasp, of divine science, he makes a genuine approach to the
   truth. For the knowledge and apprehension of intellectual objects must
   necessarily be called certain scientific knowledge, whose function in
   reference to divine things is to consider what is the First Cause, and
   what that "by whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was
   made;" [3531] and what things, on the other hand, are as pervasive, and
   what is comprehensive; what conjoined, what disjoined; and what is the
   position which each one of them holds, and what power and what service
   each contributes. And again, among human things, what man himself is,
   and what he has naturally or preternaturally; and how, again, it
   becomes him to do or to suffer; and what are his virtues and what his
   vices; and about things good, bad, and indifferent; also about
   fortitude, and prudence, and self-restraint, and the virtue which is in
   all respects complete, namely, righteousness.

   Further, he employs prudence and righteousness in the acquisition of
   wisdom, and fortitude, not only in the endurance of circumstances, but
   also in restraining [3532] pleasure and desire, grief and anger; and,
   in general, to withstand [3533] everything which either by any force or
   fraud entices us. For it is not necessary to endure vices and virtues,
   but it is to be persuaded to bear things that inspire fear.

   Accordingly, pain is found beneficial in the healing art, and in
   discipline, and in punishment; and by it men's manners are corrected to
   their advantage. Forms of fortitude are endurance, magnanimity, high
   spirit, liberality, and grandeur. And for this reason he neither meets
   with the blame or the bad opinion of the multitude; nor is he subjected
   to opinions or flatteries. But in the indurance of toils and at the
   same time [3534] in the discharge of any duty, and in his manly
   superiority to all circumstances, he appears truly a man (aner) among
   the rest of human beings. And, on the other hand, maintaining prudence,
   he exercises moderation in the calmness of his soul; receptive of what
   is commanded, as of what belongs to him, entertaining aversion to what
   is base, as alien to him; become decorous and supramundane, [3535] he
   does everything with decorum and in order, and transgresses in no
   respect, and in nothing. Rich he is in the highest degree in desiring
   nothing, as having few wants; and being in the midst of abundance of
   all good through the knowledge of the good. For it is the first effect
   of his righteousness, to love to spend his time and associate with
   those of his own race both in earth and heaven. So also he is liberal
   of what he possesses. And being a lover of men, he is a hater of the
   wicked, entertaining a perfect aversion to all villany. He must
   consequently learn to be faithful both to himself and his neighbours,
   and obedient to the commandments. For he is the true servant of God who
   spontaneously subjects himself to His commands. And he who already, not
   through the commandments, but through knowledge itself, is pure in
   heart, is the friend of God. For neither are we born by nature
   possessing virtue, nor after we are born does it grow naturally, as
   certain parts of the body; since then it would neither be voluntary nor
   praiseworthy. Nor is virtue, like speech, perfected by the practice
   that results from everyday occurrences (for this is very much the way
   in which vice originates). For it is not by any art, either those of
   acquisition, or those which relate to the care of the body, that
   knowledge is attained. No more is it from the curriculum of
   instruction. For that is satisfied if it can only prepare and sharpen
   the soul. For the laws of the state are perchance able to restrain bad
   actions; but persuasive words, which but touch the surface, cannot
   produce a scientific permanence of the truth.

   Now the Greek philosophy, as it were, purges the soul, and prepares it
   beforehand for the reception of faith, on which the Truth builds up the
   edifice of knowledge.

   This is the true athlete--he who in the great stadium, the fair world,
   is crowned for the true victory over all the passions. For He who
   prescribes the contest is the Almighty God, and He who awards the prize
   is the only-begotten Son of God. Angels and gods are spectators; and
   the contest, embracing all the varied exercises, is "not against flesh
   and blood," [3536] but against the spiritual powers of inordinate
   passions that work through the flesh. He who obtains the mastery in
   these struggles, and overthrows the tempter, menacing, as it were, with
   certain contests, wins immortality. For the sentence of God in most
   righteous judgment is infallible. The spectators [3537] are summoned to
   the contest, and the athletes contend in the stadium; the one, who has
   obeyed the directions of the trainer, wins the day. For to all, all
   rewards proposed by God are equal; and He Himself is unimpeachable. And
   he who has power receives mercy, and he that has exercised will is
   mighty.

   So also we have received mind, that we may know what we do. And the
   maxim "Know thyself" means here to know for what we are born. And we
   are born to obey the commandments, if we choose to be willing to be
   saved. Such is the Nemesis, [3538] through which there is no escaping
   from God. Man's duty, then, is obedience to God, who has proclaimed
   salvation manifold by the commandments. And confession is thanksgiving.
   For the beneficent first begins to do good. And he who on fitting
   considerations readily receives and keeps the commandments, is faithful
   (pistos); and he who by love requites benefits as far as he is able, is
   already a friend. One recompense on the part of men is of paramount
   importance--the doing of what is pleasing to God. As being His own
   production, and a result akin to Himself, the Teacher and Saviour
   receives acts of assistance and of improvement on the part of men as a
   personal favour and honour; as also He regards the injuries inflicted
   on those who believe on Him as ingratitude and dishonour to Himself.
   For what other dishonour can touch God? Wherefore it is impossible to
   render a recompense at all equivalent to the boon received from the
   Lord.

   And as those who maltreat property insult the owners, and those who
   maltreat soldiers insult the commander, so also the ill-usage of His
   consecrated ones is contempt for the Lord.

   For, just as the sun not only illumines heaven and the whole world,
   shining over land and sea, but also through windows and small chinks
   sends his beams into the innermost recesses of houses, so the Word
   diffused everywhere casts His eye-glance on the minutest circumstances
   of the actions of life.

      Chapter IV.--The Heathens Made Gods Like Themselves, Whence Springs All
      Superstition.

   Now, as the Greeks represent the gods as possessing human forms, so
   also do they as possessing human passions. And as each of them depict
   their forms similar to themselves, as Xenophanes says, "Ethiopians as
   black and apes, the Thracians ruddy and tawny;" so also they assimilate
   their souls to those who form them: the Barbarians, for instance, who
   make them savage and wild; and the Greeks, who make them more
   civilized, yet subject to passion.

   Wherefore it stands to reason, that the ideas entertained of God by
   wicked men must be bad, and those by good men most excellent. And
   therefore he who is in soul truly kingly and gnostic, being likewise
   pious and free from superstition, is persuaded that He who alone is God
   is honourable, venerable, august, beneficent, the doer of good, the
   author of all good things, but not the cause of evil. And respecting
   the Hellenic superstition we have, as I think, shown enough in the book
   entitled by us The Exhortation, availing ourselves abundantly of the
   history bearing on the point. There is no need, then, again to make a
   long story of what has already been clearly stated. But in as far as
   necessity requires to be pointed out on coming to the topic, suffice it
   to adduce a few out of many considerations in proof of the impiety of
   those who make the Divinity resemble the worst men. For either those
   Gods of theirs are injured by men, and are shown to be inferior to men
   on being injured by us; or, if not so, how is it that they are incensed
   at those by whom they are not injured, like a testy old wife roused to
   wrath?

   As they say that Artemis was enraged at the Ætolians on account of
   OEneus. [3539] For how, being a goddess, did she not consider that he
   had neglected to sacrifice, not through contempt, but out of
   inadvertence, or under the idea that he had sacrificed?

   And Latona, [3540] arguing her case with Athene, on account of the
   latter being incensed at her for having brought forth in the temple,
   says:--


   "Man-slaying spoils

   Torn from the dead you love to see. And these

   To you are not unclean. But you regard

   My parturition here a horrid thing,

   Though other creatures in the temple do

   No harm by bringing forth their young."

   It is natural, then, that having a superstitious dread of those
   irascible [gods], they imagine that all events are signs and causes of
   evils. If a mouse bore through an altar built of clay, and for want of
   something else gnaw through an oil flask; if a cock that is being
   fattened crow in the evening, they determine this to be a sign of
   something.

   Of such a one Menander gives a comic description in The Superstitious
   Man:--


   "A. Good luck be mine, ye honoured gods!

   Tying my right shoe's string,

   I broke it."

   "B. Most likely, silly fool,

   For it was rotten, and you, niggard, you

   Would not buy new ones." [3541]

   It was a clever remark of Antiphon, who (when one regarded it as an ill
   omen that the sow had eaten her pigs), on seeing her emaciated through
   the niggardliness of the person that kept her, said, Congratulate
   yourself on the omen that, being so hungry, she did not eat your own
   children.

   "And what wonder is it," says Bion, "if the mouse, finding nothing to
   eat, gnaws the bag?" For it were wonderful if (as Arcesilaus argued in
   fun) "the bag had eaten the mouse."

   Diogenes accordingly remarked well to one who wondered at finding a
   serpent coiled round a pestle: "Don't wonder; for it would have been
   more surprising if you had seen the pestle coiled round the serpent,
   and the serpent straight."

   For the irrational creatures must run, and scamper, and fight, and
   breed, and die; and these things being natural to them, can never be
   unnatural to us.


   "And many birds beneath the sunbeams walk."

   And the comic poet Philemon treats such points in comedy:--


   "When I see one who watches who has sneezed,

   Or who has spoke; or looking, who goes on,

   I straightway in the market sell him off.

   Each one of us walks, talks, and sneezes too,

   For his own self, not for the citizens:

   According to their nature things turn out."

   Then by the practice of temperance men seek health: and by cramming
   themselves, and wallowing in potations at feasts, they attract
   diseases.

   There are many, too, that dread inscriptions set up. Very cleverly
   Diogenes, on finding in the house of a bad man the inscription,
   "Hercules, for victory famed, dwells here; let nothing bad enter,"
   remarked, "And how shall the master of the house go in?"

   The same people, who worship every stick and greasy stone, as the
   saying is, dreads tufts of tawny wool, and lumps of salt, and torches,
   and squills, and sulphur, bewitched by sorcerers, in certain impure
   rites of expiation. But God, the true God, recognises as holy only the
   character of the righteous man,--as unholy, wrong and wickedness.

   You may see the eggs, [3542] taken from those who have been purified,
   hatched if subjected to the necessary warmth. But this could not take
   place if they had had transferred to them the sins of the man that had
   undergone purification. Accordingly the comic poet Diphilus facetiously
   writes, in comedy, of sorcerers, in the following words:--


   "Purifying Proetus' daughters, and their father

   Proetus Abantades, and fifth, an old wife to boot,

   So many people's persons with one torch, one squill,

   With sulphur and asphalt of the loud-sounding sea,

   From the placid-flowing, deep-flowing ocean.

   But blest air through the clouds send Anticyra

   That I may make this bug into a drone."

   For well Menander remarks: [3543] --


   "Had you, O Phidias, any real ill,

   You needs must seek for it a real cure;

   Now 'tis not so. And for the unreal ill

   I've found an unreal cure. Believe that it

   Will do thee good. Let women in a ring

   Wipe thee, and from three fountains water bring.

   Add salt and lentils; sprinkle then thyself.

   Each one is pure, who's conscious of no sin."

   For instance, the tragedy says:--


   Menelaus. "What disease, Orestes, is destroying thee?"

   Orestes. "Conscience. For horrid deeds I know I've done." [3544]

   For in reality there is no other purity but abstinence from sins.
   Excellently then Epicharmus says:--


   "If a pure mind thou hast,

   In thy whole body thou art pure."

   Now also we say that it is requisite to purify the soul from corrupt
   and bad doctrines by right reason; and so thereafter to the
   recollection of the principal heads of doctrine. Since also before the
   communication of the mysteries they think it right to apply certain
   purifications to those who are to be initiated; so it is requisite for
   men to abandon impious opinion, and thus turn to the true tradition.

      Chapter V.--The Holy Soul a More Excellent Temple Than Any Edifice Built
      by Man.

   For is it not the case that rightly and truly we do not circumscribe in
   any place that which cannot be circumscribed; nor do we shut up in
   temples made with hands that which contains all things? What work of
   builders, and stonecutters, and mechanical art can be holy? Superior to
   these are not they who think that the air, and the enclosing space, or
   rather the whole world and the universe, are meet for the excellency of
   God?

   It were indeed ridiculous, as the philosophers themselves say, for man,
   the plaything [3545] of God, to make God, and for God to be the
   plaything [3546] of art; since what is made is similar and the same to
   that of which it is made, as that which is made of ivory is ivory, and
   that which is made of gold golden. Now the images and temples
   constructed by mechanics are made of inert matter; so that they too are
   inert, and material, and profane; and if you perfect the art, they
   partake of mechanical coarseness. Works of art cannot then be sacred
   and divine.

   And what can be localized, there being nothing that is not localized?
   Since all things are in a place. And that which is localized having
   been formerly not localized, is localized by something. If, then, God
   is localized by men, He was once not localized, and did not exist at
   all. For the non-existent is what is not localized; since whatever does
   not exist is not localized. And what exists cannot be localized by what
   does not exist; nor by another entity. For it is also an entity. It
   follows that it must be by itself. And how shall anything generate
   itself? Or how shall that which exists place itself as to being?
   Whether, being formerly not localized, has it localized itself? But it
   was not in existence; since what exists not is not localized. And its
   localization being supposed, how can it afterwards make itself what it
   previously was?

   But how can He, to whom the things that are belong, need anything? But
   were God possessed of a human form, He would need, equally with man,
   food, and shelter, and house, and the attendant incidents. Those who
   are like in form and affections will require similar sustenance. And if
   sacred (to hieron) has a twofold application, designating both God
   Himself and the structure raised to His honour, [3547] how shall we not
   with propriety call the Church holy, through knowledge, made for the
   honour of God, sacred (hieron) to God, of great value, and not
   constructed by mechanical art, nor embellished by the hand of an
   impostor, but by the will of God fashioned into a temple? For it is not
   now the place, but the assemblage of the elect, [3548] that I call the
   Church. This temple is better for the reception of the greatness of the
   dignity of God. For the living creature which is of high value, is made
   sacred by that which is worth all, or rather which has no equivalent,
   in virtue of the exceeding sanctity of the latter. Now this is the
   Gnostic, who is of great value, who is honoured by God, in whom God is
   enshrined, that is, the knowledge respecting God is consecrated. Here,
   too, we shall find the divine likeness and the holy image in the
   righteous soul, when it is blessed in being purified and performing
   blessed deeds. Here also we shall find that which is localized, and
   that which is being localized,--the former in the case of those who are
   already Gnostics, and the latter in the case of those capable of
   becoming so, although not yet worthy of receiving the knowledge of God.
   For every being destined to believe is already faithful in the sight of
   God, and set up for His honour, an image, endowed with virtue,
   dedicated to God.

      Chapter VI.--Prayers and Praise from a Pure Mind, Ceaselessly Offered, Far
      Better Than Sacrifices.

   As, then, God is not circumscribed by place, neither is ever
   represented by the form of a living creature; so neither has He similar
   passions, nor has He wants like the creatures, so as to desire
   sacrifice, from hunger, by way of food. Those creatures which are
   affected by passion are all mortal. And it is useless to bring food to
   one who is not nourished.

   And that comic poet Pherecrates, in The Fugitives, facetiously
   represents the gods themselves as finding fault with men on the score
   of their sacred rites:--


   "When to the gods you sacrifice,

   Selecting what our portion is,

   'Tis shame to tell, do ye not take,

   And both the thighs, clean to the groins,

   The loins quite bare, the backbone, too,

   Clean scrape as with a file,

   Them swallow, and the remnant give

   To us as if to dogs? And then,

   As if of one another 'shamed,

   With heaps of salted barley hide." [3549]

   And Eubulus, also a comic poet, thus writes respecting sacrifices:--


   "But to the gods the tail alone

   And thigh, as if to pæderasts you sacrifice."

   And introducing Dionysus in Semele, he represents him disputing:--


   "First if they offer aught to me, there are

   Who offer blood, the bladder, not the heart

   Or caul. For I no flesh do ever eat

   That's sweeter than the thigh." [3550]

   And Menander writes:--


   "The end of the loin,

   The bile, the bones uneatable, they set

   Before the gods; the rest themselves consume."

   For is not the savour of the holocausts avoided by the beasts? And if
   in reality the savour is the guerdon of the gods of the Greeks, should
   they not first deify the cooks, who are dignified with equal happiness,
   and worship the chimney itself, which is closer still to the
   much-prized savour?

   And Hesiod says that Zeus, cheated in a division of flesh by
   Prometheus, received the white bones of an ox, concealed with cunning
   art, in shining fat:--


   "Whence to the immortal gods the tribes of men

   The victim's white bones on the altars burn."

   But they will by no means say that the Deity, enfeebled through the
   desire that springs from want, is nourished. Accordingly, they will
   represent Him as nourished without desire like a plant, and like beasts
   that burrow. They say that these grow innoxiously, nourished either by
   the density in the air, or from the exhalations proceeding from their
   own body. Though if the Deity, though needing nothing, is according to
   them nourished, what necessity has He for food, wanting nothing? But
   if, by nature needing nothing, He delights to be honoured, it is not
   without reason that we honour God in prayer; and thus the best and
   holiest sacrifice with righteousness we bring, presenting it as an
   offering to the most righteous Word, by whom we receive knowledge,
   giving glory by Him for what [3551] we have learned.

   The altar, then, that is with us here, the terrestrial one, is the
   congregation of those who devote themselves to prayers, having as it
   were one common voice and one mind.

   Now, if nourishing substances taken in by the nostrils are diviner than
   those taken in by the mouth, yet they infer respiration. What, then, do
   they say of God? Whether does He exhale like the tribe of oaks? [3552]
   Or does He only inhale, like the aquatic animals, by the dilatation of
   their gills? Or does He breathe all round, like the insects, by the
   compression of the section by means of their wings? But no one, if he
   is in his senses, will liken God to any of these.

   And the creatures that breathe by the expansion of the lung towards the
   thorax draw in the air. Then if they assign to God viscera, and
   arteries, and veins, and nerves, and parts, they will make Him in
   nothing different from man.

   Now breathing together (sumpnoia) [3553] is properly said of the
   Church. For the sacrifice of the Church is the word breathing as
   incense [3554] from holy souls, the sacrifice and the whole mind being
   at the same time unveiled to God. Now the very ancient altar in Delos
   they celebrated as holy; which alone, being undefiled by slaughter and
   death, they say Pythagoras approached. And will they not believe us
   when we say that the righteous soul is the truly sacred altar, and that
   incense arising from it is holy prayer? But I believe sacrifices were
   invented by men to be a pretext for eating flesh. [3555] But without
   such idolatry he who wished might have partaken of flesh.

   For the sacrifices of the Law express figuratively the piety which we
   practice, as the turtle-dove and the pigeon offered for sins point out
   that the cleansing of the irrational part of the soul is acceptable to
   God. But if any one of the righteous does not burden his soul by the
   eating of flesh, he has the advantage of a rational reason, not as
   Pythagoras and his followers dream of the transmigration of the soul.

   Now Xenocrates, treating by himself of "the food derived from animals,"
   and Polemon in his work On Life according to Nature, seem clearly to
   say that animal food is unwholesome, inasmuch as it has already been
   elaborated and assimilated to the souls of the irrational creatures.

   So also, in particular, the Jews abstain from swine's flesh on the
   ground of this animal being unclean; since more than the other animals
   it roots up, and destroys the productions of the ground. But if they
   say that the animals were assigned to men--and we agree with them--yet
   it was not entirely for food. Nor was it all animals, but such as do
   not work. Wherefore the comic poet Plato says not badly in the drama of
   The Feasts: --


   "For of the quadrupeds we should not slay

   In future aught but swine. For these have flesh

   Most toothsome; and about the pig is nought

   For us, excepting bristles, mud, and noise."

   Whence Æsop said not badly, that "swine squeaked out very loudly,
   because, when they were dragged, they knew that they were good for
   nothing but for sacrifice."

   Wherefore also Cleanthes says, "that they have soul [3556] instead of
   salt," that their flesh may not putrefy. Some, then, eat them as
   useless, others as destructive of fruits. And others do not eat them,
   because the animal has a strong sensual propensity.

   So, then, the law sacrifices not the goat, except in the sole case of
   the banishment of sins; [3557] since pleasure is the metropolis of
   vice. It is to the point also that it is said that the eating of goat's
   flesh contributes to epilepsy. And they say that the greatest increase
   is produced by swine's flesh. Wherefore it is beneficial to those who
   exercise the body; but to those who devote themselves to the
   development of the soul it is not so, on account of the hebetude that
   results from the eating of flesh. Perchance also some Gnostic will
   abstain from the eating of flesh for the sake of training, and in order
   that the flesh may not grow wanton in amorousness. "For wine," says
   Androcydes, "and gluttonous feeds of flesh make the body strong, but
   the soul more sluggish." Accordingly such food, in order to clear
   understanding, is to be rejected.

   Wherefore also the Egyptians, in the purifications practiced among
   them, do not allow the priests to feed on flesh; but they use chickens,
   as lightest; and they do not touch fish, on account of certain fables,
   but especially on account of such food making the flesh flabby. But now
   terrestrial animals and birds breathe the same air as our vital
   spirits, being possessed of a vital principle cognate with the air. But
   it is said that fishes do not breathe this air, but that which was
   mixed with the water at the instant of its first creation, as well as
   with the rest of the elements, which is also a sign of the permanence
   of matter. [3558]

   Wherefore we ought to offer to God sacrifices not costly, but such as
   He loves. And that compounded incense which is mentioned in the Law, is
   that which consists of many tongues and voices in prayer, [3559] or
   rather of different nations and natures, prepared by the gift
   vouchsafed in the dispensation for "the unity of the faith," and
   brought together in praises, with a pure mind, and just and right
   conduct, from holy works and righteous prayer. For in the elegant
   language of poetry,--


   "Who is so great a fool, and among men

   So very easy of belief, as thinks

   The gods, with fraud of fleshless bones and bile

   All burnt, not fit for hungry dogs to eat,

   Delighted are, and take this as their prize,

   And favour show to those who treat them thus,"

   though they happen to be tyrants and robbers?

   But we say that the fire sanctifies [3560] not flesh, but sinful souls;
   meaning not the all-devouring vulgar fire [3561] but that of wisdom,
   which pervades the soul passing through the fire.

      Chapter VII.--What Sort of Prayer the Gnostic Employs, and How It is Heard
      by God.

   Now we are commanded to reverence and to honour the same one, being
   persuaded that He is Word, Saviour, and Leader, and by Him, the Father,
   not on special days, as some others, but doing this continually in our
   whole life, and in every way. Certainly the elect race justified by the
   precept says, "Seven times a day have I praised Thee." [3562] Whence
   not in a specified place, [3563] or selected temple, or at certain
   festivals and on appointed days, but during his whole life, the Gnostic
   in every place, even if he be alone by himself, and wherever he has any
   of those who have exercised the like faith, honours God, that is,
   acknowledges his gratitude for the knowledge of the way to live.

   And if the presence of a good man, through the respect and reverence
   which he inspires, always improves him with whom he associates, with
   much more reason does not he who always holds uninterrupted converse
   with God by knowledge, life, and thanksgiving, grow at every step
   superior to himself in all respects--in conduct, in words, in
   disposition? Such an one is persuaded that God is ever beside him, and
   does not suppose that He is confined in certain limited places; so that
   under the idea that at times he is without Him, he may indulge in
   excesses night and day.

   Holding festival, then, in our whole life, persuaded that God is
   altogether on every side present, we cultivate our fields, praising; we
   sail the sea, hymning; in all the rest of our conversation we conduct
   ourselves according to rule. [3564] The Gnostic, then, is very closely
   allied to God, being at once grave and cheerful in all things,--grave
   on account of the bent of his soul towards the Divinity, and cheerful
   on account of his consideration of the blessings of humanity which God
   hath given us.

   Now the excellence of knowledge is evidently presented by the prophet
   when he says, "Benignity, and instruction, and knowledge teach me,"
   [3565] magnifying the supremacy of perfection by a climax.

   He is, then, the truly kingly man; he is the sacred high priest of God.
   And this is even now observed among the most sagacious of the
   Barbarians, in advancing the sacerdotal caste to the royal power. He,
   therefore, never surrenders himself to the rabble that rules supreme
   over the theatres, and gives no admittance even in a dream to the
   things which are spoken, done, and seen for the sake of alluring
   pleasures; neither, therefore, to the pleasures of sight, nor the
   various pleasures which are found in other enjoyments, as costly
   incense and odours, which bewitch the nostrils, or preparations of
   meats, and indulgences in different wines, which ensnare the palate, or
   fragrant bouquets of many flowers, which through the senses effeminate
   the soul. But always tracing up to God the grave enjoyment of all
   things, he offers the first-fruits of food, and drink, and unguents to
   the Giver of all, acknowledging his thanks in the gift and in the use
   of them by the Word given to him. He rarely goes to convivial banquets
   of all and sundry, unless the announcement to him of the friendly and
   harmonious character of the entertainment induce him to go. For he is
   convinced that God knows and perceives all things--not the words only,
   but also the thought; since even our sense of hearing, which acts
   through the passages of the body, has the apprehension [belonging to
   it] not through corporeal power, but through a psychical perception,
   and the intelligence which distinguishes significant sounds. God is
   not, then, possessed of human form, so as to hear; nor needs He senses,
   as the Stoics have decided, "especially hearing and sight; for He could
   never otherwise apprehend." But the susceptibility of the air, and the
   intensely keen perception of the angels, [3566] and the power which
   reaches the soul's consciousness, by ineffable power and without
   sensible hearing, know all things at the moment of thought. And should
   any one say that the voice does not reach God, but is rolled downwards
   in the air, yet the thoughts of the saints cleave not the air only, but
   the whole world. And the divine power, with the speed of light, sees
   through the whole soul. Well! Do not also volitions speak to God,
   uttering their voice? And are they not conveyed by conscience? And what
   voice shall He wait for, who, according to His purpose, knows the elect
   already, even before his birth, knows what is to be as already
   existent? Does not the light of power shine down to the very bottom of
   the whole soul; "the lamp of knowledge," as the Scripture says,
   searching "the recesses"? God is all ear and all eye, if we may be
   permitted to use these expressions.

   In general, then, an unworthy opinion of God preserves no piety, either
   in hymns, or discourses, or writings, or dogmas, but diverts to
   grovelling and unseemly ideas and notions. Whence the commendation of
   the multitude differs nothing from censure, in consequence of their
   ignorance of the truth. The objects, then, of desires and aspirations,
   and, in a word, of the mind's impulses, are the subjects of prayers.
   Wherefore, no man desires a draught, but to drink what is drinkable;
   and no man desires an inheritance, but to inherit. And in like manner
   no man desires knowledge, but to know; or a right government, but to
   take part in the government. The subjects of our prayers, then, are the
   subjects of our requests, and the subjects of requests are the objects
   of desires. Prayer, then, and desire, follow in order, with the view of
   possessing the blessings and advantages offered.

   The Gnostic, then, who is such by possession, makes his prayer and
   request for the truly good things which appertain to the soul, and
   prays, he himself also contributing his efforts to attain to the habit
   of goodness, so as no longer to have the things that are good as
   certain lessons belonging to him, but to be good.

   Wherefore also it is most incumbent on such to pray, knowing as they do
   the Divinity rightly, and having the moral excellence suitable to him;
   who know what things are really good, and what are to be asked, and
   when and how in each individual case. It is the extremest stupidity to
   ask of them who are no gods, as if they were gods; or to ask those
   things which are not beneficial, begging evils for themselves under the
   appearance of good things.

   Whence, as is right, there being only one good God, that some good
   things be given from Him alone, and that some remain, we and the angels
   pray. But not similarly. For it is not the same thing to pray that the
   gift remain, and to endeavour to obtain it for the first time.

   The averting of evils is a species of prayer; but such prayer is never
   to be used for the injury of men, except that the Gnostic, in devoting
   attention to righteousness, may make use of this petition in the case
   of those who are past feeling.

   Prayer is, then, to speak more boldly, converse with God. Though
   whispering, consequently, and not opening the lips, we speak in
   silence, yet we cry inwardly. [3567] For God hears continually all the
   inward converse. So also we raise the head and lift the hands to
   heaven, and set the feet in motion [3568] at the closing utterance of
   the prayer, following the eagerness of the spirit directed towards the
   intellectual essence; and endeavouring to abstract the body from the
   earth, along with the discourse, raising the soul aloft, winged with
   longing for better things, we compel it to advance to the region of
   holiness, magnanimously despising the chain of the flesh. For we know
   right well, that the Gnostic willingly passes over the whole world, as
   the Jews certainly did over Egypt, showing clearly, above all, that he
   will be as near as possible to God.

   Now, if some assign definite hours for prayer--as, for example, the
   third, and sixth, and ninth--yet the Gnostic prays throughout his whole
   life, endeavouring by prayer to have fellowship with God. [3569] And,
   briefly, having reached to this, he leaves behind him all that is of no
   service, as having now received the perfection of the man that acts by
   love. But the distribution of the hours into a threefold division,
   honoured with as many prayers, those are acquainted with, who know the
   blessed triad of the holy abodes. [3570]

   Having got to this point, I recollect the doctrines about there being
   no necessity to pray, introduced by certain of the heterodox, that is,
   the followers of the heresy of Prodicus. That they may not then be
   inflated with conceit about this godless wisdom of theirs, as if it
   were strange, let them learn that it was embraced before by the
   philosophers called Cyrenaics. [3571] Nevertheless, the unholy
   knowledge (gnosis) of those falsely called [Gnostics] shall meet with
   confutation at a fitting time; so that the assault on them, by no means
   brief, may not, by being introduced into the commentary, break the
   discourse in hand, in which we are showing that the only really holy
   and pious man is he who is truly a Gnostic according to the rule of the
   Church, to whom alone the petition made in accordance with the will of
   God is granted, [3572] on asking and on thinking. For as God can do all
   that He wishes, so the Gnostic receives all that he asks. For,
   universally, God knows those who are and those who are not worthy of
   good things; whence He gives to each what is suitable. Wherefore to
   those that are unworthy, though they ask often, He will not give; but
   He will give to those who are worthy.

   Nor is petition superfluous, though good things are given without
   claim.

   Now thanksgiving and request for the conversion of our neighbours is
   the function of the Gnostic; as also the Lord prayed, giving thanks for
   the accomplishment of His ministry, praying that as many as possible
   might attain to knowledge; that in the saved, by salvation, through
   knowledge, God might be glorified, and He who is alone good and alone
   Saviour might be acknowledged through the Son from age to age. But also
   faith, that one will receive, is a species of prayer gnostically laid
   up in store.

   But if any occasion of converse with God becomes prayer, no opportunity
   of access to God ought to be omitted. Without doubt, the holiness of
   the Gnostic, in union with [God's] blessed Providence, exhibits in
   voluntary confession the perfect beneficence of God. For the holiness
   of the Gnostic, and the reciprocal benevolence of the friend of God,
   are a kind of corresponding movement of providence. For neither is God
   involuntarily good, as the fire is warming; but in Him the imparting of
   good things is voluntary, even if He receive the request previously.
   Nor shall he who is saved be saved against his will, for he is not
   inanimate; but he will above all voluntarily and of free choice speed
   to salvation. Wherefore also man received the commandments in order
   that he might be self-impelled, to whatever he wished of things to be
   chosen and to be avoided. Wherefore God does not do good by necessity,
   but from His free choice benefits those who spontaneously turn. For the
   Providence which extends to us from God is not ministerial, as that
   service which proceeds from inferiors to superiors. But in pity for our
   weakness, the continual dispensations of Providence work, as the care
   of shepherds towards the sheep, and of a king towards his subjects; we
   ourselves also conducting ourselves obediently towards our superiors,
   who take the management of us, as appointed, in accordance with the
   commission from God with which they are invested.

   Consequently those who render the most free and kingly service, which
   is the result of a pious mind and of knowledge, are servants and
   attendants of the Divinity. Each place, then, and time, in which we
   entertain the idea of God, is in reality sacred.

   When, then, the man who chooses what is right, and is at the same time
   of thankful heart, makes his request in prayer, he contributes to the
   obtaining of it, gladly taking hold in prayer of the thing desired. For
   when the Giver of good things perceives the susceptibility on our part,
   all good things follow at once the conception of them. Certainly in
   prayer the character is sifted, how it stands with respect to duty.

   But if voice and expression are given us, for the sake of
   understanding, how can God not hear the soul itself, and the mind,
   since assuredly soul hears soul, and mind, mind? Whence God does not
   wait for loquacious tongues, as interpreters among men, but knows
   absolutely the thoughts of all; and what the voice intimates to us,
   that our thought, which even before the creation He knew would come
   into our mind, speaks to God. Prayer, then, may be uttered without the
   voice, by concentrating the whole spiritual nature within on expression
   by the mind, in un-distracted turning towards God.

   And since the dawn is an image of the day of birth, and from that point
   the light which has shone forth at first from the darkness increases,
   there has also dawned on those involved in darkness a day of the
   knowledge of truth. In correspondence with the manner of the sun's
   rising, prayers are made looking towards the sunrise in the east.
   Whence also the most ancient temples looked towards the west, that
   people might be taught to turn to the east when facing the images.
   [3573] "Let my prayer be directed before Thee as incense, the uplifting
   of my hands as the evening sacrifice," [3574] say the Psalms.

   In the case of wicked men, therefore, prayer is most injurious, not to
   others alone, but to themselves also. If, then, they should ask and
   receive what they call pieces of good fortune, these injure them after
   they receive them, being ignorant how to use them. For they pray to
   possess what they have not, and they ask things which seem, but are
   not, good things. [3575] But the Gnostic will ask the permanence of the
   things he possesses, adaptation for what is to take place, and the
   eternity of those things which he shall receive. And the things which
   are really good, the things which concern the soul, he prays that they
   may belong to him, and remain with him. And so he desires not anything
   that is absent, being content with what is present. For he is not
   deficient in the good things which are proper to him; being already
   sufficient for himself, through divine grace and knowledge. But having
   become sufficient in himself, he stands in no want of other things. But
   knowing the sovereign will, and possessing as soon as he prays, being
   brought into close contact with the almighty power, and earnestly
   desiring to be spiritual, through boundless love, he is united to the
   Spirit.

   Thus he, being magnanimous, possessing, through knowledge, what is the
   most precious of all, the best of all, being quick in applying himself
   to contemplation, retains in his soul the permanent energy of the
   objects of his contemplation, that is the perspicacious keenness of
   knowledge. And this power he strives to his utmost to acquire, by
   obtaining command of all the influences which war against the mind; and
   by applying himself without intermission to speculation, by exercising
   himself in the training of abstinence from pleasures, and of right
   conduct in what he does; and besides, furnished with great experience
   both in study and in life, he has freedom of speech, not the power of a
   babbling tongue, but a power which employs plain language, and which
   neither for favour nor fear conceals aught of the things which may be
   worthily said at the fitting time, in which it is highly necessary to
   say them. He, then, having received the things respecting God from the
   mystic choir of the truth itself, employs language which urges the
   magnitude of virtue in accordance with its worth; and shows its results
   with an inspired elevation of prayer, being associated gnostically, as
   far as possible, with intellectual and spiritual objects.

   Whence he is always mild and meek, accessible, affable, long-suffering,
   grateful, endued with a good conscience. Such a man is rigid, not alone
   so as not to be corrupted, but so as not to be tempted. For he never
   exposes his soul to submission, or capture at the hands of Pleasure and
   Pain. If the Word, who is Judge, call; he, having grown inflexible, and
   not indulging a whit the passions, walks unswervingly where justice
   advises him to go; being very well persuaded that all things are
   managed consummately well, and that progress to what is better goes on
   in the case of souls that have chosen virtue, till they come to the
   Good itself, to the Father's vestibule, so to speak, close to the great
   High Priest. Such is our Gnostic, faithful, persuaded that the affairs
   of the universe are managed in the best way. Particularly, he is well
   pleased with all that happens. In accordance with reason, then, he asks
   for none of those things in life required for necessary use; being
   persuaded that God, who knows all things, supplies the good with
   whatever is for their benefit, even though they do not ask.

   For my view is, that as all things are supplied to the man of art
   according to the rules of art, and to the Gentile in a Gentile way, so
   also to the Gnostic all things are supplied gnostically. And the man
   who turns from among the Gentiles will ask for faith, while he that
   ascends to knowledge will ask for the perfection of love. And the
   Gnostic, who has reached the summit, will pray that contemplation may
   grow and abide, as the common man will for continual good health.

   Nay, he will pray that he may never fall from virtue; giving his most
   strenuous co-operation in order that he may become infallible. For he
   knows that some of the angels, through carelessness, were hurled to the
   earth, not having yet quite reached that state of oneness, by
   extricating themselves from the propensity to that of duality.

   But him, who from this has trained himself to the summit of knowledge
   and the elevated height of the perfect man, all things relating to time
   and place help on, now that he has made it his choice to live
   infallibly, and subjects himself to training in order to the attainment
   of the stability of knowledge on each side. But in the case of those in
   whom there is still a heavy corner, leaning downwards, even that part
   which has been elevated by faith is dragged down. In him, then, who by
   gnostic training has acquired virtue which cannot be lost, habit
   becomes nature. And just as weight in a stone, so the knowledge of such
   an one is incapable of being lost. Not without, but through the
   exercise of will, and by the force of reason, and knowledge, and
   Providence, is it brought to become incapable of being lost. Through
   care it becomes incapable of being lost. He will employ caution so as
   to avoid sinning, and consideration to prevent the loss of virtue.

   Now knowledge appears to produce consideration, by teaching to perceive
   the things that are capable of contributing to the permanence of
   virtue. The highest thing is, then, the knowledge of God; wherefore
   also by it virtue is so preserved as to be incapable of being lost. And
   he who knows God is holy and pious. The Gnostic has consequently been
   demonstrated by us to be the only pious man.

   He rejoices in good things present, and is glad on account of those
   promised, as if they were already present. For they do not elude his
   notice, as if they were still absent, because he knows by anticipation
   what sort they are. Being then persuaded by knowledge how each future
   thing shall be, he possesses it. For want and defect are measured with
   reference to what appertains to one. If, then, he possesses wisdom, and
   wisdom is a divine thing, he who partakes of what has no want will
   himself have no want. For the imparting of wisdom does not take place
   by activity and receptivity moving and stopping each other, or by aught
   being abstracted or becoming defective. Activity is therefore shown to
   be undiminished in the act of communication. So, then, our Gnostic
   possesses all good things, as far as possible; but not likewise in
   number; since otherwise he would be incapable of changing his place
   through the due inspired stages of advancement and acts of
   administration.

   Him God helps, by honouring him with closer oversight. For were not all
   things made for the sake of good men, for their possession and
   advantage, or rather salvation? He will not then deprive, of the things
   which exist for the sake of virtue, those for whose sake they were
   created. For, evidently in honour of their excellent nature and their
   holy choice, he inspires those who have made choice of a good life with
   strength for the rest of their salvation; exhorting some, and helping
   others, who of themselves have become worthy. For all good is capable
   of being produced in the Gnostic; if indeed it is his aim to know and
   do everything intelligently. And as the physician ministers health to
   those who co-operate with him in order to health, so also God ministers
   eternal salvation to those who co-operate for the attainment of
   knowledge and good conduct; and since what the commandments enjoin are
   in our own power, along with the performance of them, the promise is
   accomplished.

   And what follows seems to me to be excellently said by the Greeks. An
   athlete of no mean reputation among those of old, having for a long
   time subjected his body to thorough training in order to the attainment
   of manly strength, on going up to the Olympic games, cast his eye on
   the statue of the Pisæan Zeus, and said: "O Zeus, if all the requisite
   preparations for the contest have been made by me, come, give me the
   victory, as is right." For so, in the case of the Gnostic, who has
   unblameably and with a good conscience fulfilled all that depends on
   him, in the direction of learning, and training, and well-doing, and
   pleasing God, the whole contributes to carry salvation on to
   perfection. From us, then, are demanded the things which are in our own
   power, and of the things which pertain to us, both present and absent,
   the choice, and desire, and possession, and use, and permanence.

   Wherefore also he who holds converse with God must have his soul
   immaculate and stainlessly pure, it being essential to have made
   himself perfectly good.

   But also it becomes him to make all his prayers gently with the good.
   For it is a dangerous thing to take part in others' sins. Accordingly
   the Gnostic will pray along with those who have more recently believed,
   for those things in respect of which it is their duty to act together.
   And his whole life is a holy festival. [3576] His sacrifices are
   prayers, and praises, and readings in the Scriptures before meals, and
   psalms and hymns during meals and before bed, and prayers also again
   during night. By these he unites himself to the divine choir, from
   continual recollection, engaged in contemplation which has everlasting
   remembrance.

   And what? Does he not also know the other kind of sacrifice, which
   consists in the giving both of doctrines and of money to those who
   need? Assuredly. But he does not use wordy prayer by his mouth; having
   learned to ask of the Lord what is requisite. In every place,
   therefore, but not ostensibly and visibly to the multitude, he will
   pray. But while engaged in walking, in conversation, while in silence,
   while engaged in reading and in works according to reason, he in every
   mood prays. [3577] If he but form the thought in the secret chamber of
   his soul, and call on the Father "with unspoken groanings," [3578] He
   is near, and is at his side, while yet speaking. Inasmuch as there are
   but three ends of all action, he does everything for its excellence and
   utility; but doing aught for the sake of pleasure, [3579] he leaves to
   those who pursue the common life.

      Chapter VIII.--The Gnostic So Addicted to Truth as Not to Need to Use an
      Oath.

   The man of proved character in such piety is far from being apt to lie
   and to swear. For an oath is a decisive affirmation, with the taking of
   the divine name. For how can he, that is once faithful, show himself
   unfaithful, so as to require an oath; and so that his life may not be a
   sure and decisive oath? He lives, and walks, and shows the
   trustworthiness of his affirmation in an unwavering and sure life and
   speech. And if the wrong lies in the judgment of one who does and says
   [something], and not in the suffering of one who has been wronged,
   [3580] he will neither lie nor commit perjury so as to wrong the Deity,
   knowing that it by nature is incapable of being harmed. Nor yet will he
   lie or commit any transgression, for the sake of the neighbour whom he
   has learned to love, though he be not on terms of intimacy. Much more,
   consequently, will he not lie or perjure himself on his own account,
   since he never with his will can be found doing wrong to himself.

   But he does not even swear, preferring to make averment, in affirmation
   by "yea," and in denial by "nay." For it is an oath to swear, or to
   produce [3581] anything from the mind in the way of confirmation in the
   shape of an oath. It suffices, then, with him, to add to an affirmation
   or denial the expression "I say truly," for confirmation to those who
   do not perceive the certainty of his answer. For he ought, I think, to
   maintain a life calculated to inspire confidence towards those without,
   so that an oath may not even be asked; and towards himself and those
   with whom he associates [3582] good feeling, which is voluntary
   righteousness.

   The Gnostic swears truly, but is not apt to swear, having rarely
   recourse to an oath, just as we have said. And his speaking truth on
   oath arises from his accord with the truth. This speaking truth on
   oath, then, is found to be the result of correctness in duties. Where,
   then, is the necessity for an oath to him who lives in accordance with
   the extreme of truth? [3583] He, then, that does not even swear will be
   far from perjuring himself. And he who does not transgress in what is
   ratified by compacts, will never swear; since the ratification of the
   violation and of the fulfilment is by actions; as certainly lying and
   perjury in affirming and swearing are contrary to duty. But he who
   lives justly, transgressing in none of his duties, when the judgment of
   truth is scrutinized, swears truth by his acts. Accordingly, testimony
   by the tongue is in his case superfluous.

   Therefore, persuaded always that God is everywhere, and fearing not to
   speak the truth, and knowing that it is unworthy of him to lie, he is
   satisfied with the divine consciousness and his own alone [3584] And so
   he lies not, nor does aught contrary to his compacts. And so he swears
   not even when asked for his oath; nor does he ever deny, so as to speak
   falsehood, though he should die by tortures.

      Chapter IX.--Those Who Teach Others, Ought to Excel in Virtues.

   The gnostic dignity is augmented and increased by him who has
   undertaken the first place in the teaching of others, and received the
   dispensation by word and deed of the greatest good on earth, by which
   he mediates contact and fellowship with the Divinity. And as those who
   worship terrestrial things pray to them as if they heard, confirming
   compacts before them; so, in men who are living images, the true
   majesty of the Word is received by the trustworthy teacher; and the
   beneficence exerted towards them is carried up to the Lord, after whose
   image he who is a true man by instruction creates and harmonizes,
   renewing to salvation the man who receives instruction. For as the
   Greeks called steel Ares, and wine Dionysus, on account of a certain
   relation; so the Gnostic considering the benefit of his neighbours as
   his own salvation, may be called a living image of the Lord, not as
   respects the peculiarity of form, but the symbol of power and
   similarity of preaching.

   Whatever, therefore, he has in his mind, he bears on his tongue, to
   those who are worthy to hear, speaking as well as living from assent
   and inclination. For he both thinks and speaks the truth; unless at any
   time, medicinally, as a physician for the safety of the sick, he may
   deceive or tell an untruth, according to the Sophists. [3585]

   To illustrate: the noble apostle circumcised Timothy, though loudly
   declaring and writing that circumcision made with hands profits
   nothing. [3586] But that he might not, by dragging all at once away
   from the law to the circumcision of the heart through faith those of
   the Hebrews who were reluctant listeners, compel them to break away
   from the synagogue, he, "accommodating himself to the Jews, became a
   Jew that he might gain all." [3587] He, then, who submits to
   accommodate himself merely for the benefit of his neighbours, for the
   salvation of those for whose sake he accommodates himself, not
   partaking in any dissimulation through the peril impending over the
   just from those who envy them, such an one by no means acts with
   compulsion. [3588] But for the benefit of his neighbours alone, he will
   do things which would not have been done by him primarily, if he did
   not do them on their account. Such an one gives himself for the Church,
   for the disciples whom he has begotten in faith; for an example to
   those who are capable of receiving the supreme economy of the
   philanthropic and God-loving Instructor, for confirmation of the truth
   of his words, for the exercise of love to the Lord. Such an one is
   unenslaved by fear, true in word, enduring in labour, never willing to
   lie by uttered word, and in it always securing sinlessness; since
   falsehood, being spoken with a certain deceit, is not an inert word,
   but operates to mischief.

   On every hand, then, the Gnostic alone testifies to the truth in deed
   and word. For he always does rightly in all things, both in word and
   action, and in thought itself.

   Such, then, to speak cursorily, is the piety of the Christian. If,
   then, he does these things according to duty and right reason, he does
   them piously and justly. And if such be the case, the Gnostic alone is
   really both pious, and just, and God-fearing.

   The Christian is not impious. For this was the point incumbent on us to
   demonstrate to the philosophers; so that he will never in any way do
   aught bad or base (which is unjust). Consequently, therefore, he is not
   impious; but he alone fears God, holily and dutifully worshipping the
   true God, the universal Ruler, and King, and Sovereign, with the true
   piety.

      Chapter X.--Steps to Perfection.

   For knowledge (gnosis), to speak generally, a perfecting of man as man,
   is consummated by acquaintance with divine things, in character, life,
   and word, accordant and conformable to itself and to the divine Word.
   For by it faith is perfected, inasmuch as it is solely by it that the
   believer becomes perfect. Faith is an internal good, and without
   searching for God, confesses His existence, and glorifies Him as
   existent. Whence by starting from this faith, and being developed by
   it, through the grace of God, the knowledge respecting Him is to be
   acquired as far as possible.

   Now we assert that knowledge (gnosis) differs from the wisdom (sophia),
   which is the result of teaching. For as far as anything is knowledge,
   so far is it certainly wisdom; but in as far as aught is wisdom, it is
   not certainly knowledge. For the term wisdom appears only in the
   knowledge of the uttered word.

   But it is not doubting in reference to God, but believing, that is the
   foundation of knowledge. But Christ is both the foundation and the
   superstructure, by whom are both the beginning and the ends. And the
   extreme points, the beginning and the end--I mean faith and love--are
   not taught. But knowledge, conveyed from communication through the
   grace of God as a deposit, is entrusted to those who show themselves
   worthy of it; and from it the worth of love beams forth from light to
   light. For it is said, "To him that hath shall be given:" [3589] to
   faith, knowledge; and to knowledge, love; and to love, the inheritance.

   And this takes place, whenever one hangs on the Lord by faith, by
   knowledge, by love, and ascends along with Him to where the God and
   guard of our faith and love is. Whence at last (on account of the
   necessity for very great preparation and previous training in order
   both to hear what is said, and for the composure of life, and for
   advancing intelligently to a point beyond the righteousness of the law)
   it is that knowledge is committed to those fit and selected for it. It
   leads us to the endless and perfect end, teaching us beforehand the
   future life that we shall lead, according to God, and with gods; after
   we are freed from all punishment and penalty which we undergo, in
   consequence of our sins, for salutary discipline. After which
   redemption the reward and the honours are assigned to those who have
   become perfect; when they have got done with purification, and ceased
   from all service, though it be holy service, and among saints. Then
   become pure in heart, and near to the Lord, there awaits them
   restoration to everlasting contemplation; and they are called by the
   appellation of gods, being destined to sit on thrones with the other
   gods that have been first put in their places by the Saviour.

   Knowledge is therefore quick in purifying, and fit for that acceptable
   transformation to the better. Whence also with ease it removes [the
   soul] to what is akin to the soul, divine and holy, and by its own
   light conveys man through the mystic stages of advancement; till it
   restores the pure in heart to the crowning place of rest; teaching to
   gaze on God, face to face, with knowledge and comprehension. For in
   this consists the perfection of the gnostic soul, in its being with the
   Lord, where it is in immediate subjection to Him, after rising above
   all purification and service.

   Faith is then, so to speak, a comprehensive knowledge of the
   essentials; [3590] and knowledge is the strong and sure demonstration
   of what is received by faith, built upon faith by the Lord's teaching,
   conveying [the soul] on to infallibility, science, and comprehension.
   And, in my view, the first saving change is that from heathenism to
   faith, as I said before; and the second, that from faith to knowledge.
   And the latter terminating in love, thereafter gives the loving to the
   loved, that which knows to that which is known. And, perchance, such an
   one has already attained the condition of "being equal to the angels."
   [3591] Accordingly, after the highest excellence in the flesh, changing
   always duly to the better, he urges his flight to the ancestral hall,
   through the holy septenniad [of heavenly abodes] to the Lord's own
   mansion; to be a light, steady, and continuing eternally, entirely and
   in every part immutable.

   The first mode of the Lord's operation mentioned by us is an exhibition
   of the recompense resulting from piety. Of the very great number of
   testimonies that there are, I shall adduce one, thus summarily
   expressed by the prophet David: "Who shall ascend to the hill of the
   Lord, or who shall stand in His holy place? He who is guiltless in his
   hands, and pure in his heart; who hath not lifted up his soul to
   vanity, or sworn deceitfully to his neighbour. He shall receive
   blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God his Saviour. This is the
   generation of them that seek the Lord, that seek the face of the God of
   Jacob." [3592] The prophet has, in my opinion, concisely indicated the
   Gnostic. David, as appears, has cursorily demonstrated the Saviour to
   be God, by calling Him "the face of the God of Jacob," who preached and
   taught concerning the Spirit. Wherefore also the apostle designates as
   "the express image (charaktera) of the glory of the Father" [3593] the
   Son, who taught the truth respecting God, and expressed the fact that
   the Almighty is the one and only God and Father, "whom no man knoweth
   but the Son, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him." [3594] That God
   is one is intimated by those "who seek the face of the God of Jacob;"
   whom being the only God, our Saviour and God characterizes as the Good
   Father. And "the generation of those that seek Him" is the elect race,
   devoted to inquiry after knowledge. Wherefore also the apostle says, "I
   shall profit you nothing, unless I speak to you, either by revelation,
   or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by doctrine." [3595]

   Although even by those who are not Gnostics some things are done
   rightly, yet not according to reason; as in the case of fortitude. For
   some who are naturally high-spirited, and have afterwards without
   reason fostered this disposition, rush to many things, and act like
   brave men, so as sometimes to succeed in achieving the same things;
   just as endurance is easy for mechanics. But it is not from the same
   cause, or with the same object; not were they to give their whole body.
   "For they have not love," according to the apostle. [3596]

   All the action, then, of a man possessed of knowledge is right action;
   and that done by a man not possessed of knowledge is wrong action,
   though he observe a plan; since it is not from reflection that he acts
   bravely, nor does he direct his action in those things which proceed
   from virtue to virtue, to any useful purpose.

   The same holds also with the other virtues. So too the analogy is
   preserved in religion. Our Gnostic, then, not only is such in reference
   to holiness; but corresponding to the piety of knowledge are the
   commands respecting the rest of the conduct of life. For it is our
   purpose at present to describe the life of the Gnostic, [3597] not to
   present the system of dogmas, which we shall afterwards explain at the
   fitting time, preserving the order of topics.

      Chapter XI.--Description of the Gnostic's Life.

   Respecting the universe, he conceives truly and grandly in virtue of
   his reception of divine teaching. Beginning, then, with admiration of
   the Creation, and affording of himself a proof of his capability for
   receiving knowledge, he becomes a ready pupil of the Lord. Directly on
   hearing of God and Providence, he believed in consequence of the
   admiration he entertained. Through the power of impulse thence derived
   he devotes his energies in every way to learning, doing all those
   things by means of which he shall be able to acquire the knowledge of
   what he desires. And desire blended with inquiry arises as faith
   advances. And this is to become worthy of speculation, of such a
   character, and such importance. So shall the Gnostic taste of the will
   of God. For it is not his ears, but his soul, that he yields up to the
   things signified by what is spoken. Accordingly, apprehending essences
   and things through the words, he brings his soul, as is fit, to what is
   essential; apprehending (e.g.) in the peculiar way in which they are
   spoken to the Gnostic, the commands, "Do not commit adultery," "Do not
   kill;" and not as they are understood by other people. [3598] Training
   himself, then, in scientific speculation, he proceeds to exercise
   himself in larger generalizations and grander propositions; knowing
   right well that "He that teacheth man knowledge," according to the
   prophet, is the Lord, the Lord acting by man's mouth. So also He
   assumed flesh.

   As is right, then, he never prefers the pleasant to the useful; not
   even if a beautiful woman were to entice him, when overtaken by
   circumstances, by wantonly urging him: since Joseph's master's wife was
   not able to seduce him from his stedfastness; but as she violently held
   his coat, divested himself of it,--becoming bare of sin, but clothed
   with seemliness of character. For if the eyes of the master--the
   Egyptian, I mean--saw not Joseph, yet those of the Almighty looked on.
   For we hear the voice, and see the bodily forms; but God scrutinizes
   the thing itself, from which the speaking and the looking proceed.

   Consequently, therefore, though disease, and accident, and what is most
   terrible of all, death, come upon the Gnostic, he remains inflexible in
   soul,--knowing that all such things are a necessity of creation, and
   that, also by the power of God, they become the medicine of salvation,
   benefiting by discipline those who are difficult to reform; allotted
   according to desert, by Providence, which is truly good.

   Using the creatures, then, when the Word prescribes, and to the extent
   it prescribes, in the exercise of thankfulness to the Creator, he
   becomes master of the enjoyment of them.

   He never cherishes resentment or harbours a grudge against any one,
   though deserving of hatred for his conduct. For he worships the Maker,
   and loves him, who shares life, pitying and praying for him on account
   of his ignorance. He indeed partakes of the affections of the body, to
   which, susceptible as it is of suffering by nature, he is bound. But in
   sensation he is not the primary subject of it.

   Accordingly, then, in involuntary circumstances, by withdrawing himself
   from troubles to the things which really belong to him, he is not
   carried away with what is foreign to him. And it is only to things that
   are necessary for him that he accommodates himself, in so far as the
   soul is preserved unharmed. For it is not in supposition or seeming
   that he wishes to be faithful; but in knowledge and truth, that is, in
   sure deed and effectual word. [3599] Wherefore he not only praises what
   is noble, but endeavours himself to be noble; changing by love from a
   good and faithful servant into a friend, through the perfection of
   habit, which he has acquired in purity from true instruction and great
   discipline.

   Striving, then, to attain to the summit of knowledge (gnosis); decorous
   in character; composed in mien; possessing all those advantages which
   belong to the true Gnostic; fixing his eye on fair models, on the many
   patriarchs who have lived rightly, and on very many prophets and angels
   reckoned without number, and above all, on the Lord, who taught and
   showed it to be possible for him to attain that highest life of
   all,--he therefore loves not all the good things of the world, which
   are within his grasp, that he may not remain on the ground, but the
   things hoped for, or rather already known, being hoped for so as to be
   apprehended.

   So then he undergoes toils, and trials, and afflictions, not as those
   among the philosophers who are endowed with manliness, in the hope of
   present troubles ceasing, and of sharing again in what is pleasant; but
   knowledge has inspired him with the firmest persuasion of receiving the
   hopes of the future. Wherefore he contemns not alone the pains of this
   world, but all its pleasures.

   They say, accordingly, that the blessed Peter, on seeing his wife led
   to death, rejoiced on account of her call and conveyance home, and
   called very encouragingly and comfortingly, addressing her by name,
   "Remember thou the Lord." Such was the marriage of the blessed and
   their perfect disposition towards those dearest to them. [3600]

   Thus also the apostle says, "that he who marries should be as though he
   married not," [3601] and deem his marriage free of inordinate
   affection, and inseparable from love to the Lord; to which the true
   husband exhorted his wife to cling on her departure out of this life to
   the Lord.

   Was not then faith in the hope after death conspicuous in the case of
   those who gave thanks to God even in the very extremities of their
   punishments? For firm, in my opinion, was the faith they possessed,
   which was followed by works of faith.

   In all circumstances, then, is the soul of the Gnostic strong, in a
   condition of extreme health and strength, like the body of an athlete.

   For he is prudent in human affairs, in judging what ought to be done by
   the just man; having obtained the principles from God from above, and
   having acquired, in order to the divine resemblance, moderation in
   bodily pains and pleasures. And he struggles against fears boldly,
   trusting in God. Certainly, then, the gnostic soul, adorned with
   perfect virtue, is the earthly image of the divine power; its
   development being the joint result of nature, of training, of reason,
   all together. This beauty of the soul becomes a temple of the Holy
   Spirit, when it acquires a disposition in the whole of life
   corresponding to the Gospel. Such an one consequently withstands all
   fear of everything terrible, not only of death, but also poverty and
   disease, and ignominy, and things akin to these; being unconquered by
   pleasure, and lord over irrational desires. For he well knows what is
   and what is not to be done; being perfectly aware what things are
   really to be dreaded, and what not. Whence he bears intelligently what
   the Word intimates to him to be requisite and necessary; intelligently
   discriminating what is really safe (that is, good), from what appears
   so; and things to be dreaded from what seems so, such as death,
   disease, and poverty; which are rather so in opinion than in truth.

   This is the really good man, who is without passions; having, through
   the habit or disposition of the soul endued with virtue, transcended
   the whole life of passion. He has everything dependent on himself for
   the attainment of the end. For those accidents which are called
   terrible are not formidable to the good man, because they are not evil.
   And those which are really to be dreaded are foreign to the gnostic
   Christian, being diametrically opposed to what is good, because evil;
   and it is impossible for contraries to meet in the same person at the
   same time. He, then, who faultlessly acts the drama of life which God
   has given him to play, knows both what is to be done and what is to be
   endured.

   Is it not then from ignorance of what is and what is not to be dreaded
   that cowardice arises? Consequently the only man of courage is the
   Gnostic, who knows both present and future good things; along with
   these, knowing, as I have said, also the things which are in reality
   not to be dreaded. Because, knowing vice alone to be hateful, and
   destructive of what contributes to knowledge, protected by the armour
   of the Lord, he makes war against it.

   For if anything is caused through folly, and the operation or rather
   co-operation of the devil, this thing is not straightway the devil or
   folly. For no action is wisdom. For wisdom is a habit. And no action is
   a habit. The action, then, that arises from ignorance, is not already
   ignorance, but an evil through ignorance, but not ignorance. For
   neither perturbations of mind nor sins are vices, though proceeding
   from vice.

   No one, then, who is irrationally brave is a Gnostic; [3602] since one
   might call children brave, who, through ignorance of what is to be
   dreaded, undergo things that are frightful. So they touch fire even.
   And the wild beasts that rush close on the points of spears, having a
   brute courage, might be called valiant. And such people might perhaps
   call jugglers valiant, who tumble on swords with a certain dexterity,
   practising a mischievous art for sorry gain. But he who is truly brave,
   with the peril arising from the bad feeling of the multitude before his
   eyes, courageously awaits whatever comes. In this way he is
   distinguished from others that are called martyrs, inasmuch as some
   furnish occasions for themselves, and rush into the heart of dangers, I
   know not how (for it is right to use mild language); while they, in
   accordance with right reason, protect themselves; then, on God really
   calling them, promptly surrender themselves, and confirm the call, from
   being conscious of no precipitancy, and present the man to be proved in
   the exercise of true rational fortitude. Neither, then, enduring lesser
   dangers from fear of greater, like other people, nor dreading censure
   at the hands of their equals, and those of like sentiments, do they
   continue in the confession of their calling; but from love to God they
   willingly obey the call, with no other aim in view than pleasing God,
   and not for the sake of the reward of their toils.

   For some suffer from love of glory, and others from fear of some other
   sharper punishment, and others for the sake of pleasures and delights
   after death, being children in faith; blessed indeed, but not yet
   become men in love to God, as the Gnostic is. For there are, as in the
   gymnastic contests, so also in the Church, crowns for men and for
   children. But love is to be chosen for itself, and for nothing else.
   Therefore in the Gnostic, along with knowledge, the perfection of
   fortitude is developed from the discipline of life, he having always
   studied to acquire mastery over the passions.

   Accordingly, love makes its own athlete fearless and dauntless, and
   confident in the Lord, anointing and training him; as righteousness
   secures for him truthfulness in his whole life. [3603] For it was a
   compendium of righteousness to say, "Let your yea be yea; and your nay,
   nay." [3604]

   And the same holds with self-control. For it is neither for love of
   honour, as the athletes for the sake of crowns and fame; nor on the
   other hand, for love of money, as some pretend to exercise
   self-control, pursuing what is good with terrible suffering. Nor is it
   from love of the body for the sake of health. Nor any more is any man
   who is temperate from rusticity, who has not tasted pleasures, truly a
   man of self-control. Certainly those who have led a laborious life, on
   tasting pleasures, forthwith break down the inflexibility of temperance
   into pleasures. Such are they who are restrained by law and fear. For
   on finding a favourable opportunity they defraud the law, by giving
   what is good the slip. But self-control, desirable for its own sake,
   perfected through knowledge, abiding ever, makes the man lord and
   master of himself; so that the Gnostic is temperate and passionless,
   incapable of being dissolved by pleasures and pains, as they say
   adamant is by fire.

   The cause of these, then, is love, of all science the most sacred and
   most sovereign.

   For by the service of what is best and most exalted, which is
   characterized by unity, it renders the Gnostic at once friend and son,
   having in truth grown "a perfect man, up to the measure of full
   stature." [3605]

   Further, agreement in the same thing is consent. But what is the same
   is one. And friendship is consummated in likeness; the community lying
   in oneness. The Gnostic, consequently, in virtue of being a lover of
   the one true God, is the really perfect man and friend of God, and is
   placed in the rank of son. For these are names of nobility and
   knowledge, and perfection in the contemplation of God; which crowning
   step of advancement the gnostic soul receives, when it has become quite
   pure, reckoned worthy to behold everlastingly God Almighty, "face," it
   is said, "to face." For having become wholly spiritual, and having in
   the spiritual Church gone to what is of kindred nature, it abides in
   the rest of God.

      Chapter XII.--The True Gnostic is Beneficent, Continent, and Despises
      Worldly Things.

   Let these things, then, be so. And such being the attitude of the
   Gnostic towards the body and the soul--towards his neighbours, whether
   it be a domestic, or a lawful enemy, or whosoever--he is found equal
   and like. For he does not "despise his brother," who, according to the
   divine law, is of the same father and mother. Certainly he relieves the
   afflicted, helping him with consolations, encouragements, and the
   necessaries of life; giving to all that need, though not similarly, but
   justly, according to desert; furthermore, to him who persecutes and
   hates, even if he need it; caring little for those who say to him that
   he has given out of fear, if it is not out of fear that he does so, but
   to give help. For how much more are those, who towards their enemies
   are devoid of love of money, and are haters of evil, animated with love
   to those who belong to them?

   Such an one from this proceeds to the accurate knowledge of whom he
   ought chiefly to give to, and how much, and when, and how.

   And who could with any reason become the enemy of a man who gives no
   cause for enmity in any way? And is it not just as in the case of God?
   We say that God is the adversary of no one, and the enemy of no one
   (for He is the Creator of all, and nothing that exists is what He wills
   it not to be; but we assert that the disobedient, and those who walk
   not according to His commandments, are enemies to Him, as being those
   who are hostile to His covenant). We shall find the very same to be the
   case with the Gnostic, for he can never in any way become an enemy to
   any one; but those may be regarded enemies to him who turn to the
   contrary path.

   In particular, the habit of liberality [3606] which prevails among us
   is called "righteousness;" but the power of discriminating according to
   desert, as to greater and less, with reference to those who am proper
   subjects of it, is a form of the very highest righteousness.

   There are things practiced in a vulgar style by some people, such as
   control over pleasures. For as, among the heathen, there are those who,
   from the impossibility of obtaining what one sees, [3607] and from fear
   of men, and also for the sake of greater pleasures, abstain from the
   delights that are before them; so also, in the case of faith, some
   practice self-restraint, either out of regard to the promise or from
   fear of God. Well, such self-restraint is the basis of knowledge, and
   an approach to something better, and an effort after perfection. For
   "the fear of the Lord," it is said, "is the beginning of wisdom."
   [3608] But the perfect man, out of love, "beareth all things, endureth
   all things," [3609] "as not pleasing man, but God." [3610] Although
   praise follows him as a consequence, it is not for his own advantage,
   but for the imitation and benefit of those who praise him.

   According to another view, it is not he who merely controls his
   passions that is called a continent man, but he who has also achieved
   the mastery over good things, and has acquired surely the great
   accomplishments of science, from which he produces as fruits the
   activities of virtue. Thus the Gnostic is never, on the occurrence of
   an emergency, dislodged from the habit peculiar to him. For the
   scientific possession of what is good is firm and unchangeable, being
   the knowledge of things divine and human. Knowledge, then, never
   becomes ignorance nor does good change into evil. Wherefore also he
   eats, and drinks, and marries, not as principal ends of existence, but
   as necessary. I name marriage even, if the Word prescribe, and as is
   suitable. For having become perfect, he [3611] has the apostles for
   examples; and one is not really shown to be a man in the choice of
   single life; but he surpasses men, who, disciplined by marriage,
   procreation of children, and care for the house, without pleasure or
   pain, in his solicitude for the house has been inseparable from God's
   love, and withstood all temptation arising through children, and wife,
   and domestics, and possessions. But he that has no family is in a great
   degree free of temptation. Caring, then, for himself alone, he is
   surpassed by him who is inferior, as far as his own personal salvation
   is concerned, but who is superior in the conduct of life, preserving
   certainly, in his care for the truth, a minute image.

   But we must as much as possible subject the soul to varied preparatory
   exercise, that it may become susceptible to the reception of knowledge.
   Do you not see how wax is softened and copper purified, in order to
   receive the stamp applied to it? Just as death is the separation of the
   soul from the body, so is knowledge as it were the rational death
   urging the spirit away, and separating it from the passions, and
   leading it on to the life of well-doing, that it may then say with
   confidence to God, "I live as Thou wishest." For he who makes it his
   purpose to please men cannot please God, since the multitude choose not
   what is profitable, but what is pleasant. But in pleasing God, one as a
   consequence gets the favour of the good among men. How, then, can what
   relates to meat, and drink, and amorous pleasure, be agreeable to such
   an one? since he views with suspicion even a word that produces
   pleasure, and a pleasant movement and act of the mind. "For no one can
   serve two masters, God and Mammon," [3612] it is said; meaning not
   simply money, but the resources arising from money bestowed on various
   pleasures. In reality, it is not possible for him who magnanimously and
   truly knows God, to serve antagonistic pleasures.

   There is one alone, then, who from the beginning was free of
   concupiscence--the philanthropic Lord, who for us became man. And
   whosoever endeavour to be assimilated to the impress given by Him,
   strive, from exercise, to become free of concupiscence. For he who has
   exercised concupiscence and then restrained himself, is like a widow
   who becomes again a virgin by continence. Such is the reward of
   knowledge, rendered to the Saviour and Teacher, which He Himself asked
   for,--abstinence from what is evil, activity in doing good, by which
   salvation is acquired.

   As, then, those who have learned the arts procure their living by what
   they have been taught, so also is the Gnostic saved, procuring life by
   what he knows. For he who has not formed the wish to extirpate the
   passion of the soul, kills himself. But, as seems, ignorance is the
   starvation of the soul, and knowledge its sustenance.

   Such are the gnostic souls, which the Gospel likened to the consecrated
   virgins who wait for the Lord. For they are virgins, in respect of
   their abstaining from what is evil. And in respect of their waiting out
   of love for the Lord and kindling their light for the contemplation of
   things, they are wise souls, saying, "Lord, for long we have desired to
   receive Thee; we have lived according to what Thou hast enjoined,
   transgressing none of Thy commandments. Wherefore also we claim the
   promises. And we pray for what is beneficial, since it is not requisite
   to ask of Thee what is most excellent. And we shall take everything for
   good; even though the exercises that meet us, which Thine arrangement
   brings to us for the discipline of our stedfastness, appear to be
   evil."

   The Gnostic, then, from his exceeding holiness, is better prepared to
   fail when he asks, than to get when he does not ask.

   His whole life is prayer and converse with God. [3613] And if he be
   pure from sins, he will by all means obtain what he wishes. For God
   says to the righteous man, "Ask, and I will give thee; think, and I
   will do." If beneficial, he will receive it at once; and if injurious,
   he will never ask it, and therefore he will not receive it. So it shall
   be as he wishes.

   But if one say to us, that some sinners even obtain according to their
   requests, [we should say] that this rarely takes place, by reason of
   the righteous goodness of God. And it is granted to those who are
   capable of doing others good. Whence the gift is not made for the sake
   of him that asked it; but the divine dispensation, foreseeing that one
   would be saved by his means, renders the boon again righteous. And to
   those who are worthy, things which are really good are given, even
   without their asking.

   Whenever, then, one is righteous, not from necessity or out of fear or
   hope, but from free choice, this is called the royal road, which the
   royal race travel. But the byways are slippery and precipitous. If,
   then, one take away fear and honour, I do not know if the illustrious
   among the philosophers, who use such freedom of speech, will any longer
   endure afflictions.

   Now lusts and other sins are called "briars and thorns." Accordingly
   the Gnostic labours in the Lord's vineyard, planting, pruning,
   watering; being the divine husbandman of what is planted in faith.
   Those, then, who have not done evil, think it right to receive the
   wages of ease. But he who has done good out of free choice, demands the
   recompense as a good workman. He certainly shall receive double
   wages--both for what he has not done, and for what good he has done.

   Such a Gnostic is tempted by no one except with God's permission, and
   that for the benefit of those who are with him; and he strengthens them
   for faith, encouraging them by manly endurance. And assuredly it was
   for this end, for the establishment and confirmation of the Churches,
   that the blessed apostles were brought into trial and to martyrdom.

   The Gnostic, then, hearing a voice ringing in his ear, which says,
   "Whom I shall strike, do thou pity," beseeches that those who hate him
   may repent. For the punishment of malefactors, to be consummated in the
   highways, is for children to behold; [3614] for there is no possibility
   of the Gnostic, who has from choice trained himself to be excellent and
   good, ever being instructed or delighted with such spectacles. [3615]
   And so, having become incapable of being softened by pleasures, and
   never falling into sins, he is not corrected by the examples of other
   men's sufferings. And far from being pleased with earthly pleasures and
   spectacles is he who has shown a noble contempt for the prospects held
   out in this world, although they are divine.

   "Not every one," therefore, "that says Lord, Lord, shall enter into the
   kingdom of God; but he that doeth the will of God." [3616] Such is the
   gnostic labourer, who has the mastery of worldly desires even while
   still in the flesh; and who, in regard to things future and still
   invisible, which he knows, has a sure persuasion, so that he regards
   them as more present than the things within reach. This able workman
   rejoices in what he knows, but is cramped on account of his being
   involved in the necessities of life; not yet deemed worthy of the
   active participation in what he knows. So he uses this life as if it
   belonged to another,--so far, that is, as is necessary.

   He knows also the enigmas of the fasting of those days [3617] --I mean
   the Fourth and the Preparation. For the one has its name from Hermes,
   and the other from Aphrodite. He fasts in his life, in respect of
   covetousness and voluptuousness, from which all the vices grow. For we
   have already often above shown the three varieties of fornication,
   according to the apostle--love of pleasure, love of money, idolatry. He
   fasts, then, according to the Law, abstaining from bad deeds, and,
   according to the perfection of the Gospel, from evil thoughts.
   Temptations are applied to him, not for his purification, but, as we
   have said, for the good of his neighbours, if, making trial of toils
   and pains, he has despised and passed them by.

   The same holds of pleasure. For it is the highest achievement for one
   who has had trial of it, afterwards to abstain. For what great thing is
   it, if a man restrains himself in what he knows not? He, in fulfilment
   of the precept, according to the Gospel, keeps the Lord's day, [3618]
   when he abandons an evil disposition, and assumes that of the Gnostic,
   glorifying the Lord's resurrection in himself. Further, also, when he
   has received the comprehension of scientific speculation, he deems that
   he sees the Lord, directing his eyes towards things invisible, although
   he seems to look on what he does not wish to look on; chastising the
   faculty of vision, when he perceives himself pleasurably affected by
   the application of his eyes; since he wishes to see and hear that alone
   which concerns him.

   In the act of contemplating the souls of the brethren, he beholds the
   beauty of the flesh also, with the soul itself, which has become
   habituated to look solely upon that which is good, without carnal
   pleasure. And they are really brethren; inasmuch as, by reason of their
   elect creation, and their oneness of character, and the nature of their
   deeds, they do, and think, and speak the same holy and good works, in
   accordance with the sentiments with which the Lord wished them as elect
   to be inspired.

   For faith shows itself in their making choice of the same things; and
   knowledge, in learning and thinking the same things; and hope, in
   desiring [3619] the same things.

   And if, through the necessity of life, he spend a small portion of time
   about his sustenance, he thinks himself defrauded, being diverted by
   business. [3620] Thus not even in dreams does he look on aught that is
   unsuitable to an elect man. For thoroughly [3621] a stranger and
   sojourner in the whole of life is every such one, who, inhabiting the
   city, despises the things in the city which are admired by others, and
   lives in the city as in a desert, so that the place may not compel him,
   but his mode of life show him to be just.

   This Gnostic, to speak compendiously, makes up for the absence of the
   apostles, by the rectitude of his life, the accuracy of his knowledge,
   by benefiting his relations, by "removing the mountains" of his
   neighbours, and putting away the irregularities of their soul. Although
   each of us is his [3622] own vineyard and labourer.

   He, too, while doing the most excellent things, wishes to elude the
   notice of men, persuading the Lord along with himself that he is living
   in accordance with the [3623] commandments, preferring these things
   from believing them to exist. "For where any one's mind is, there also
   is his treasure." [3624]

   He impoverishes himself, in order that he may never overlook a brother
   who has been brought into affliction, through the perfection that is in
   love, especially if he know that he will bear want himself easier than
   his brother. He considers, accordingly, the other's pain his own grief;
   and if, by contributing from his own indigence in order to do good, he
   suffer any hardship, he does not fret at this, but augments his
   beneficence still more. For he possesses in its sincerity the faith
   which is exercised in reference to the affairs of life, and praises the
   Gospel in practice and contemplation. And, in truth, he wins his praise
   "not from men, but from God," [3625] by the performance of what the
   Lord has taught.

   He, attracted by his own hope, tastes not the good things that are in
   the world, entertaining a noble contempt for all things here; pitying
   those that are chastised after death, who through punishment
   unwillingly make confession; having a clear conscience with reference
   to his departure, and being always ready, as "a stranger and pilgrim,"
   with regard to the inheritances here; mindful only of those that are
   his own, and regarding all things here as not his own; not only
   admiring the Lord's commandments, but, so to speak, being by knowledge
   itself partaker of the divine will; a truly chosen intimate of the Lord
   and His commands in virtue of being righteous; and princely and kingly
   as being a Gnostic; despising all the gold on earth and under the
   earth, and dominion from shore to shore of ocean, so that he may cling
   to the sole service of the Lord. Wherefore also, in eating, and
   drinking, and marrying (if the Word enjoin), and even in seeing dreams,
   [3626] he does and thinks what is holy.

   So is he always pure for prayer. He also prays in the society of
   angels, as being already of angelic rank, and he is never out of their
   holy keeping; and though he pray alone, he has the choir of the saints
   [3627] standing with him.

   He recognises a twofold [element in faith], both the activity of him
   who believes, and the excellence of that which is believed according to
   its worth; since also righteousness is twofold, that which is out of
   love, and that from fear. Accordingly it is said, "The fear of the Lord
   is pure, remaining for ever and ever." [3628] For those that from fear
   turn to faith and righteousness, remain for ever. Now fear works
   abstinence from what is evil; but love exhorts to the doing of good, by
   building up to the point of spontaneousness; that one may hear from the
   Lord, "I call you no longer servants, but friends," and may now with
   confidence apply himself to prayer.

   And the form of his prayer is thanksgiving for the past, for the
   present, and for the future as already through faith present. This is
   preceded by the reception of knowledge. And he asks to live the
   allotted life in the flesh as a Gnostic, as free from the flesh, and to
   attain to the best things, and flee from the worse. He asks, too,
   relief in those things in which we have sinned, and conversion to the
   acknowledgment of them. [3629]

   He follows, on his departure, Him who calls, as quickly, so to speak,
   as He who goes before calls, hasting by reason of a good conscience to
   give thanks; and having got there with Christ shows himself worthy,
   through his purity, to possess, by a process of blending, the power of
   God communicated by Christ. For he does not wish to be warm by
   participation in heat, or luminous by participation in flame, but to be
   wholly light.

   He knows accurately the declaration, "Unless ye hate father and mother,
   and besides your own life, and unless ye bear the sign [of the cross]."
   [3630] For he hates the inordinate affections of the flesh, which
   possess the powerful spell of pleasure; and entertains a noble contempt
   for all that belongs to the creation and nutriment of the flesh. He
   also withstands the corporeal [3631] soul, putting a bridle-bit on the
   restive irrational spirit: "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit."
   [3632] And "to bear the sign of [the cross]" is to bear about death, by
   taking farewell of all things while still alive; since there is not
   equal love in "having sown the flesh," [3633] and in having formed the
   soul for knowledge.

   He having acquired the habit of doing good, exercises beneficence well,
   quicker than speaking; praying that he may get a share in the sins of
   his brethren, in order to confession and conversion on the part of his
   kindred; and eager to give a share to those dearest to him of his own
   good things. And so these are to him, friends. Promoting, then, the
   growth of the seeds deposited in him, according to the husbandry
   enjoined by the Lord, he continues free of sin, and becomes continent,
   and lives in spirit with those who are like him, among the choirs of
   the saints, though still detained on earth.

   He, all day and night, speaking and doing the Lord's commands, rejoices
   exceedingly, not only on rising in the morning and at noon, but also
   when walking about, when asleep, when dressing and undressing; [3634]
   and he teaches his son, if he has a son. He is inseparable from the
   commandment and from hope, and is ever giving thanks to God, like the
   living creatures figuratively spoken of by Esaias, and submissive in
   every trial, he says, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away."
   [3635] For such also was Job; who after the spoiling of his effects,
   along with the health of his body, resigned all through love to the
   Lord. For "he was," it is said, "just, holy, and kept apart from all
   wickedness." [3636] Now the word "holy" points out all duties toward
   God, and the entire course of life. Knowing which, he was a Gnostic.
   For we must neither cling too much to such things, even if they are
   good, seeing they are human, nor on the other hand detest them, if they
   are bad; but we must be above both [good and bad], trampling the latter
   under foot, and passing on the former to those who need them. But the
   Gnostic is cautious in accommodation, lest he be not perceived, or lest
   the accommodation become disposition.

      Chapter XIII.--Description of the Gnostic Continued.

   He never remembers those who have sinned against him, but forgives
   them. Wherefore also he righteously prays, saying, "Forgive us; for we
   also forgive." [3637] For this also is one of the things which God
   wishes, to covet nothing, to hate no one. For all men are the work of
   one will. And is it not the Saviour, who wishes the Gnostic to be
   perfect as "the heavenly Father," [3638] that is, Himself, who says,
   "Come, ye children, hear from me the fear of the Lord?" [3639] He
   wishes him no longer to stand in need of help by angels, but to receive
   it from Himself, having become worthy, and to have protection from
   Himself by obedience.

   Such an one demands from the Lord, and does not merely ask. And in the
   case of his brethren in want, the Gnostic will not ask himself for
   abundance of wealth to bestow, but will pray that the supply of what
   they need may be furnished to them. For so the Gnostic gives his prayer
   to those who are in need, and by his prayer they are supplied, without
   his knowledge, and without vanity.

   Penury and disease, and such trials, are often sent for admonition, for
   the correction of the past, and for care for the future. Such an one
   prays for relief from them, in virtue of possessing the prerogative of
   knowledge, not out of vainglory; but from the very fact of his being a
   Gnostic, he works beneficence, having become the instrument of the
   goodness of God.

   They say in the traditions [3640] that Matthew the apostle constantly
   said, that "if the neighbour of an elect man sin, the elect man has
   sinned. For had he conducted himself as the Word prescribes, his
   neighbour also would have been filled with such reverence for the life
   he led as not to sin."

   What, then, shall we say of the Gnostic himself? "Know ye not," says
   the apostle, "that ye are the temple of God?" [3641] The Gnostic is
   consequently divine, and already holy, God-bearing, and God-borne. Now
   the Scripture, showing that sinning is foreign to him, sells those who
   have fallen away to strangers, saying, "Look not on a strange woman, to
   lust," [3642] plainly pronounces sin foreign and contrary to the nature
   of the temple of God. Now the temple is great, as the Church, and it is
   small, as the man who preserves the seed of Abraham. He, therefore, who
   has God resting in him will not desire aught else. At once leaving all
   hindrances, and despising all matter which distracts him, he cleaves
   the heaven by knowledge. And passing through the spiritual Essences,
   and all rule and authority, he touches the highest thrones, hasting to
   that alone for the sake of which alone he knew.

   Mixing, then, "the serpent with the dove," [3643] he lives at once
   perfectly and with a good conscience, mingling faith with hope, in
   order to the expectation of the future. For he is conscious of the boon
   he has received, having become worthy of obtaining it; and is
   translated from slavery to adoption, as the consequence of knowledge;
   knowing God, or rather known of Him, for the end, he puts forth
   energies corresponding to the worth of grace. For works follow
   knowledge, as the shadow the body.

   Rightly, then, he is not disturbed by anything which happens; nor does
   he suspect those things, which, through divine arrangement, take place
   for good. Nor is he ashamed to die, having a good conscience, and being
   fit to be seen by the Powers. Cleansed, so to speak, from all the
   stains of the soul, he knows right well that it will be better with him
   after his departure.

   Whence he never prefers pleasure and profit to the divine arrangement,
   since he trains himself by the commands, that in all things he may be
   well pleasing to the Lord, and praiseworthy in the sight of the world,
   since all things depend on the one Sovereign God. The Son of God, it is
   said, came to His own, and His own received Him not. Wherefore also in
   the use of the things of the world he not only gives thanks and praises
   the creation, but also, while using them as is right, is praised; since
   the end he has in view terminates in contemplation by gnostic activity
   in accordance with the commandments.

   Thence now, by knowledge collecting materials to be the food of
   contemplation, having embraced nobly the magnitude of knowledge, he
   advances to the holy recompense of translation hence. For he has heard
   the Psalm which says: "Encircle Zion, and encompass it, tell upon its
   towers." [3644] For it intimates, I think, those who have sublimely
   embraced the Word, so as to become lofty towers, and to stand firmly in
   faith and knowledge.

   Let these statements concerning the Gnostic, containing the germs of
   the matter in as brief terms as possible, be made to the Greeks. But
   let it be known that if the [mere] believer do rightly one or a second
   of these things, yet he will not do so in all nor with the highest
   knowledge, like the Gnostic.

      Chapter XIV.--Description of the Gnostic Furnished by an Exposition of 1
      Cor. vi. 1, Etc.

   Now, of what I may call the passionlessness which we attribute to the
   Gnostic (in which the perfection of the believer, "advancing by love,
   comes to a perfect man, to the measure of full stature," [3645] by
   being assimilated to God, and by becoming truly angelic), many other
   testimonies from the Scripture, occur to me to adduce. But I think it
   better, on account of the length of the discourse, that such an honour
   should be devolved on those who wish to take pains, and leave it to
   them to elaborate the dogmas by the selection of Scriptures.

   One passage, accordingly, I shall in the briefest terms advert to, so
   as not to leave the topic unexplained.

   For in the first Epistle to the Corinthians the divine apostle says:
   "Dare any of you, having a matter against the other, go to law before
   the unrighteous, and not before the saints? Know ye not that the saints
   shall judge the world?" [3646] and so on.

   The section being very long, we shall exhibit the meaning of the
   apostle's utterance by employing such of the apostolic expressions as
   are most pertinent, and in the briefest language, and in a sort of
   cursory way, interpreting the discourse in which he describes the
   perfection of the Gnostic. For he does not merely instance the Gnostic
   as characterized by suffering wrong rather than do wrong; but he
   teaches that he is not mindful of injuries, and does not allow him even
   to pray against the man who has done him wrong. For he knows that the
   Lord expressly enjoined "to pray for enemies." [3647]

   To say, then, that the man who has been injured goes to law before the
   unrighteous, is nothing else than to say that he shows a wish to
   retaliate, and a desire to injure the second in return, which is also
   to do wrong likewise himself.

   And his saying, that he wishes "some to go to law before the saints,"
   points out those who ask by prayer that those who have done wrong
   should suffer retaliation for their injustice, and intimates that the
   second are better than the former; but they are not yet obedient,
   [3648] if they do not, having become entirely free of resentment, pray
   even for their enemies.

   It is well, then, for them to receive right dispositions from
   repentance, which results in faith. For if the truth seems to get
   enemies who entertain bad feeling, yet it is not hostile to any one.
   "For God makes His sun to shine on the just and on the unjust," [3649]
   and sent the Lord Himself to the just and the unjust. And he that
   earnestly strives to be assimilated to God, in the exercise of great
   absence of resentment, forgives seventy times seven times, as it were
   all his life through, and in all his course in this world (that being
   indicated by the enumeration of sevens) shows clemency to each and any
   one; if any during the whole time of his life in the flesh do the
   Gnostic wrong. For he not only deems it right that the good man should
   resign his property alone to others, being of the number of those who
   have done him wrong; but also wishes that the righteous man should ask
   of those judges forgiveness for the offences of those who have done him
   wrong. And with reason, if indeed it is only in that which is external
   and concerns the body, though it go to the extent of death even, that
   those who attempt to wrong him take advantage of him; none of which
   truly belong to the Gnostic.

   And how shall one "judge" the apostate "angels," who has become himself
   an apostate from that forgetfulness of injuries, which is according to
   the Gospel? "Why do ye not rather suffer wrong?" he says; "why are ye
   not rather defrauded? Yea, ye do wrong and defraud," [3650] manifestly
   by praying against those who transgress in ignorance, and deprive of
   the philanthropy and goodness of God, as far as in you lies, those
   against whom you pray, "and these your brethren,"--not meaning those in
   the faith only, but also the proselytes. For whether he who now is
   hostile shall afterwards believe, we know not as yet. From which the
   conclusion follows clearly, if all are not yet brethren to us, they
   ought to be regarded in that light. And now it is only the man of
   knowledge who recognises all men to be the work of one God, and
   invested with one image in one nature, although some may be more turbid
   than others; and in the creatures he recognises the operation, by which
   again he adores the will of God.

   "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of
   God?" [3651] He acts unrighteously who retaliates, whether by deed or
   word, or by the conception of a wish, which, after the training of the
   Law, the Gospel rejects.

   "And such were some of you"--such manifestly as those still are whom
   you do not forgive; "but ye are washed," [3652] not simply as the rest,
   but with knowledge; ye have cast off the passions of the soul, in order
   to become assimilated, as far as possible, to the goodness of God's
   providence by long-suffering, and by forgiveness "towards the just and
   the unjust," casting on them the gleam of benignity in word and deeds,
   as the sun.

   The Gnostic will achieve this either by greatness of mind, or by
   imitation of what is better. And that is a third cause. "Forgive, and
   it shall be forgiven you;" the commandment, as it were, compelling to
   salvation through superabundance of goodness.

   "But ye are sanctified." For he who has come to this state is in a
   condition to be holy, falling into none of the passions in any way, but
   as it were already disembodied and already grown holy without [3653]
   this earth.

   "Wherefore," he says, "ye are justified in the name of the Lord." Ye
   are made, so to speak, by Him to be righteous as He is, and are blended
   as far as possible with the Holy Spirit. For "are not all things lawful
   to me? yet I will not be brought under the power of any," [3654] so as
   to do, or think, or speak aught contrary to the Gospel. "Meats for the
   belly, and the belly for meats, which God shall destroy," [3655] --that
   is, such as think and live as if they were made for eating, and do not
   eat that they may live as a consequence, and apply to knowledge as the
   primary end. And does he not say that these are, as it were, the fleshy
   parts of the holy body? As a body, the Church of the Lord, the
   spiritual and holy choir, is symbolized. [3656] Whence those, who are
   merely called, but do not live in accordance with the word, are the
   fleshy parts. "Now" this spiritual "body," the holy Church, "is not for
   fornication." Nor are those things which belong to heathen life to be
   adopted by apostasy from the Gospel. For he who conducts himself
   heathenishly in the Church, whether in deed, or word, or even in
   thought, commits fornication with reference to the Church and his own
   body. He who in this way "is joined to the harlot," that is, to conduct
   contrary to the Covenant becomes another "body," not holy, "and one
   flesh," and has a heathenish life and another hope. "But he that is
   joined to the Lord in spirit" becomes a spiritual body by a different
   kind of conjunction.

   Such an one is wholly a son, an holy man, passionless, gnostic,
   perfect, formed by the teaching of the Lord; in order that in deed, in
   word, and in spirit itself, being brought close to the Lord, he may
   receive the mansion that is due to him who has reached manhood thus.

   Let the specimen suffice to those who have ears. For it is not required
   to unfold the mystery, but only to indicate what is sufficient for
   those who are partakers in knowledge to bring it to mind; who also will
   comprehend how it was said by the Lord, "Be ye perfect as your father,
   perfectly," [3657] by forgiving sins, and forgetting injuries, and
   living in the habit of passionlessness. For as we call a physician
   perfect, and a philosopher perfect, so also, in my view, do we call a
   Gnostic perfect. But not one of those points, although of the greatest
   importance, is assumed in order to the likeness of God. For we do not
   say, as the Stoics do most impiously, that virtue in man and God is the
   same. Ought we not then to be perfect, as the Father wills? For it is
   utterly impossible for any one to become perfect as God is. Now the
   Father wishes us to be perfect by living blamelessly, according to the
   obedience of the Gospel.

   If, then, the statement being elliptical, we understand what is
   wanting, in order to complete the section for those who are incapable
   of understanding what is left out, we shall both know the will of God,
   and shall walk at once piously and magnanimously, as befits the dignity
   of the commandment.

      Chapter XV.--The Objection to Join the Church on Account of the Diversity
      of Heresies Answered.

   Since it comes next to reply to the objections alleged against us by
   Greeks and Jews; and since, in some of the questions previously
   discussed, the sects also who adhere to other teaching give their help,
   it will be well first to clear away the obstacles before us, and then,
   prepared thus for the solution of the difficulties, to advance to the
   succeeding Miscellany.

   First, then, they make this objection to us, saying, that they ought
   not to believe on account of the discord of the sects. For the truth is
   warped when some teach one set of dogmas, others another.

   To whom we say, that among you who are Jews, and among the most famous
   of the philosophers among the Greeks, very many sects have sprung up.
   And yet you do not say that one ought to hesitate to philosophize or
   Judaize, because of the want of agreement of the sects among you
   between themselves. And then, that heresies should be sown among the
   truth, as "tares among the wheat," was foretold by the Lord; and what
   was predicted to take place could not but happen. [3658] And the cause
   of this is, that everything that is fair is followed by a foul blot. If
   one, then, violate his engagements, and go aside from the confession
   which he makes before us, are we not to stick to the truth because he
   has belied his profession? But as the good man must not prove false or
   fail to ratify what he has promised, although others violate their
   engagements; so also are we bound in no way to transgress the canon of
   the Church. [3659] And especially do we keep our profession in the most
   important points, while they traverse it.

   Those, then, are to be believed, who hold firmly to the truth. And we
   may broadly make use of this reply, and say to them, that physicians
   holding opposite opinions according to their own schools, yet equally
   in point of fact treat patients. Does one, then, who is ill in body and
   needing treatment, not have recourse to a physician, on account of the
   different schools in medicine? No more, then, may he who in soul is
   sick and full of idols, make a pretext of the heresies, in reference to
   the recovery of health and conversion to God.

   Further, it is said that it is on account of "those that are approved
   that heresies exist." [3660] [The apostle] calls "approved," either
   those who in reaching faith apply to the teaching of the Lord with some
   discrimination (as those are called skilful [3661] money-changers, who
   distinguish the spurious coin from the genuine by the false stamp), or
   those who have already become approved both in life and knowledge.

   For this reason, then, we require greater attention and consideration
   in order to investigate how precisely we ought to live, and what is the
   true piety. For it is plain that, from the very reason that truth is
   difficult and arduous of attainment, questions arise from which spring
   the heresies, savouring of self-love and vanity, of those who have not
   learned or apprehended truly, but only caught up a mere conceit of
   knowledge. With the greater care, therefore, are we to examine the real
   truth, which alone has for its object the true God. And the toil is
   followed by sweet discovery and reminiscence.

   On account of the heresies, therefore, the toil of discovery must be
   undertaken; but we must not at all abandon [the truth]. For, on fruit
   being set before us, some real and ripe, and some made of wax, as like
   the real as possible, we are not to abstain from both on account of the
   resemblance. But by the exercise of the apprehension of contemplation,
   and by reasoning of the most decisive character, we must distinguish
   the true from the seeming.

   And as, while there is one royal highway, there are many others, some
   leading to a precipice, some to a rushing river or to a deep sea, no
   one will shrink from travelling by reason of the diversity, but will
   make use of the safe, and royal, and frequented way; so, though some
   say this, some that, concerning the truth, we must not abandon it; but
   must seek out the most accurate knowledge respecting it. Since also
   among garden-grown vegetables weeds also spring up, are the husbandmen,
   then, to desist from gardening?

   Having then from nature abundant means for examining the statements
   made, we ought to discover the sequence of the truth. Wherefore also we
   are rightly condemned, if we do not assent to what we ought to obey,
   and do not distinguish what is hostile, and unseemly, and unnatural,
   and false, from what is true, consistent, and seemly, and according to
   nature. And these means must be employed in order to attain to the
   knowledge of the real truth.

   This pretext is then, in the case of the Greeks, futile; for those who
   are willing may find the truth. But in the case of those who adduce
   unreasonable excuses, their condemnation is unanswerable. For whether
   do they deny or admit that there is such a thing as demonstration? I am
   of opinion that all will make the admission, except those who take away
   the senses. There being demonstration, then, it is necessary to
   condescend to questions, and to ascertain by way of demonstration by
   the Scriptures themselves how the heresies failed, and how in the truth
   alone and in the ancient Church is both the exactest knowledge, and the
   truly best set of principles (airesis). [3662]

   Now, of those who diverge from the truth, some attempt to deceive
   themselves alone, and some also their neighbours. Those, then, who are
   called (doxosophoi) wise in their own opinions, who think that they
   have found the truth, but have no true demonstration, deceive
   themselves in thinking that they have reached a resting place. And of
   whom there is no inconsiderable multitude, who avoid investigations for
   fear of refutations, and shun instructions for fear of condemnation.
   But those who deceive those who seek access to them are very astute;
   who, aware that they know nothing, yet darken the truth with plausible
   arguments.

   But, in my opinion, the nature of plausible arguments is of one
   character, and that of true arguments of another. And we know that it
   is necessary that the appellation of the heresies should be expressed
   in contradistinction to the truth; from which the Sophists, drawing
   certain things for the destruction of men, and burying them in human
   arts invented by themselves, glory rather in being at the head of a
   School than presiding over the Church. [3663]

      Chapter XVI.--Scripture the Criterion by Which Truth and Heresy are
      Distinguished. [3664]

   But those who are ready to toil in the most excellent pursuits, will
   not desist from the search after truth, till they get the demonstration
   from the Scriptures themselves.

   There are certain criteria common to men, as the senses; and others
   that belong to those who have employed their wills and energies in what
   is true,--the methods which are pursued by the mind and reason, to
   distinguish between true and false propositions.

   Now, it is a very great thing to abandon opinion, by taking one's stand
   between accurate knowledge and the rash wisdom of opinion, and to know
   that he who hopes for everlasting rest knows also that the entrance to
   it is toilsome "and strait." And let him who has once received the
   Gospel, even in the very hour in which he has come to the knowledge of
   salvation, "not turn back, like Lot's wife," as is said; and let him
   not go back either to his former life, which adheres to the things of
   sense, or to heresies. For they form the character, not knowing the
   true God. "For he that loveth father or mother more than Me," the
   Father and Teacher of the truth, who regenerates and creates anew, and
   nourishes the elect soul, "is not worthy of Me"--He means, to be a son
   of God and a disciple of God, and at the same time also to be a friend,
   and of kindred nature. "For no man who looks back, and puts his hand to
   the plough, is fit for the kingdom of God." [3665]

   But, as appears, many even down to our own time regard Mary, on account
   of the birth of her child, as having been in the puerperal state,
   although she was not. For some say that, after she brought forth, she
   was found, when examined, to be a virgin. [3666]

   Now such to us are the Scriptures of the Lord, which gave birth to the
   truth and continue virgin, in the concealment of the mysteries of the
   truth. "And she brought forth, and yet brought not forth," [3667] says
   the Scripture; as having conceived of herself, and not from
   conjunction. Wherefore the Scriptures have conceived to Gnostics; but
   the heresies, not having learned them, dismissed them as not having
   conceived.

   Now all men, having the same judgment, some, following the Word
   speaking, frame for themselves proofs; while others, giving themselves
   up to pleasures, wrest Scripture, in accordance with their lusts.
   [3668] And the lover of truth, as I think, needs force of soul. For
   those who make the greatest attempts must fail in things of the highest
   importance; unless, receiving from the truth itself the rule of the
   truth, they cleave to the truth. But such people, in consequence of
   falling away from the right path, err in most individual points; as you
   might expect from not having the faculty for judging of what is true
   and false, strictly trained to select what is essential. For if they
   had, they would have obeyed the Scriptures. [3669]

   As, then, if a man should, similarly to those drugged by Circe, become
   a beast; so he, who has spurned the ecclesiastical tradition, and
   darted off to the opinions of heretical men, has ceased to be a man of
   God and to remain faithful to the Lord. But he who has returned from
   this deception, on hearing the Scriptures, and turned his life to the
   truth, is, as it were, from being a man made a god.

   For we have, as the source of teaching, the Lord, both by the prophets,
   the Gospel, and the blessed apostles, "in divers manners and at sundry
   times," [3670] leading from the beginning of knowledge to the end. But
   if one should suppose that another origin [3671] was required, then no
   longer truly could an origin be preserved.

   He, then, who of himself believes the Scripture and voice of the Lord,
   which by the Lord acts to the benefiting of men, is rightly [regarded]
   faithful. Certainly we use it as a criterion in the discovery of
   things. [3672] What is subjected to criticism is not believed till it
   is so subjected; so that what needs criticism cannot be a first
   principle. Therefore, as is reasonable, grasping by faith the
   indemonstrable first principle, and receiving in abundance, from the
   first principle itself, demonstrations in reference to the first
   principle, we are by the voice of the Lord trained up to the knowledge
   of the truth.

   For we may not give our adhesion to men on a bare statement by them,
   who might equally state the opposite. But if it is not enough merely to
   state the opinion, but if what is stated must be confirmed, we do not
   wait for the testimony of men, but we establish the matter that is in
   question by the voice of the Lord, which is the surest of all
   demonstrations, or rather is the only demonstration; in which knowledge
   those who have merely tasted the Scriptures are believers; while those
   who, having advanced further, and become correct expounders of the
   truth, are Gnostics. Since also, in what pertains to life, craftsmen
   are superior to ordinary people, and model what is beyond common
   notions; so, consequently, we also, giving a complete exhibition of the
   Scriptures from the Scriptures themselves, from faith persuade by
   demonstration. [3673]

   And if those also who follow heresies venture to avail themselves of
   the prophetic Scriptures; in the first place they will not make use of
   all the Scriptures, and then they will not quote them entire, nor as
   the body and texture of prophecy prescribe. But, selecting ambiguous
   expressions, they wrest them to their own opinions, gathering a few
   expressions here and there; not looking to the sense, but making use of
   the mere words. For in almost all the quotations they make, you will
   find that they attend to the names alone, while they alter the
   meanings; neither knowing, as they affirm, nor using the quotations
   they adduce, according to their true nature.

   But the truth is not found by changing the meanings (for so people
   subvert all true teaching), but in the consideration of what perfectly
   belongs to and becomes the Sovereign God, and in establishing each one
   of the points demonstrated in the Scriptures again from similar
   Scriptures. Neither, then, do they want to turn to the truth, being
   ashamed to abandon the claims of self-love; nor are they able to manage
   their opinions, by doing violence to the Scriptures. But having first
   promulgated false dogmas to men; plainly fighting against almost the
   whole Scriptures, and constantly confuted by us who contradict them;
   for the rest, even now partly they hold out against admitting the
   prophetic Scriptures, and partly disparage us as of a different nature,
   and incapable of understanding what is peculiar to them. And sometimes
   even they deny their own dogmas, when these are confuted, being ashamed
   openly to own what in private they glory in teaching. For this may be
   seen in all the heresies, when you examine the iniquities of their
   dogmas. For when they are overturned by our clearly showing that they
   are opposed to the Scriptures, [3674] one of two things may be seen to
   have been done by those who defend the dogma. For they either despise
   the consistency of their own dogmas, or despise the prophecy itself, or
   rather their own hope. And they invariably prefer what seems to them to
   be more evident to what has been spoken by the Lord through the
   prophets and by the Gospel, and, besides, attested and confirmed by the
   apostles.

   Seeing, therefore, the danger that they are in (not in respect of one
   dogma, but in reference to the maintenance of the heresies) of not
   discovering the truth; for while reading the books we have ready at
   hand, they despise them as useless, but in their eagerness to surpass
   common faith, they have diverged from the truth. For, in consequence of
   not learning the mysteries of ecclesiastical knowledge, and not having
   capacity for the grandeur of the truth, too indolent to descend to the
   bottom of things, reading superficially, they have dismissed the
   Scriptures. [3675] Elated, then, by vain opinion, they are incessantly
   wrangling, and plainly care more to seem than to be philosophers. Not
   laying as foundations the necessary first principles of things; and
   influenced by human opinions, then making the end to suit them, by
   compulsion; on account of being confuted, they spar with those who are
   engaged in the prosecution of the true philosophy, and undergo
   everything, and, as they say, ply every oar, even going the length of
   impiety, by disbelieving the Scriptures, [3676] rather than be removed
   from the honours of the heresy and the boasted first seat in their
   churches; on account of which also they eagerly embrace that convivial
   couch of honour in the Agape, falsely so called.

   The knowledge of the truth among us from what is already believed,
   produces faith in what is not yet believed; which [faith] is, so to
   speak, the essence of demonstration. But, as appears, no heresy has at
   all ears to hear what is useful, but opened only to what leads to
   pleasure. Since also, if one of them would only obey the truth, he
   would be healed.

   Now the cure of self-conceit (as of every ailment) is threefold: the
   ascertaining of the cause, and the mode of its removal; and thirdly,
   the training of the soul, and the accustoming it to assume a right
   attitude to the judgments come to. For, just like a disordered eye, so
   also the soul that has been darkened by unnatural dogmas cannot
   perceive distinctly the light of truth, but even overlooks what is
   before it.

   They say, then, that in muddy water eels are caught by being blinded.
   And just as knavish boys bar out the teacher, so do these shut out the
   prophecies from their Church, regarding them with suspicion by reason
   of rebuke and admonition. In fact, they stitch together a multitude of
   lies and figments, that they may appear acting in accordance with
   reason in not admitting the Scriptures. So, then, they are not pious,
   inasmuch as they are not pleased with the divine commands, that is,
   with the Holy Spirit. And as those almonds are called empty in which
   the contents are worthless, not those in which there is nothing; so
   also we call those heretics empty, who are destitute of the counsels of
   God and the traditions of Christ; bitter, in truth, like the wild
   almond, their dogmas originating with themselves, with the exception of
   such truths as they could not, by reason of their evidence, discard and
   conceal.

   As, then, in war the soldier must not leave the post which the
   commander has assigned him, so neither must we desert the post assigned
   by the Word, whom we have received as the guide of knowledge and of
   life. But the most have not even inquired, if there is one that we
   ought to follow, and who this is, and how he is to be followed. For as
   is the Word, such also must the believer's life be, so as to be able to
   follow God, who brings all things to end from the beginning by the
   right course.

   But when one has transgressed against the Word, and thereby against
   God; if it is through becoming powerless in consequence of some
   impression being suddenly made, he ought to see to have the impressions
   of reasons at hand. And if it is that he has become "common," as the
   Scripture [3677] says, in consequence of being overcome the habits
   which formerly had sway by over him, the habits must be entirely put a
   stop to, and the soul trained to oppose them. And if it appears that
   conflicting dogmas draw some away, these must be taken out of the way,
   and recourse is to be had to those who reconcile dogmas, and subdue by
   the charm of the Scriptures such of the untutored as are timid, by
   explaining the truth by the connection of the Testaments. [3678]

   But, as appears, we incline to ideas founded on opinion, though they be
   contrary, rather than to the truth. For it is austere and grave. Now,
   since there are three states of the soul--ignorance, opinion,
   knowledge--those who are in ignorance are the Gentiles, those in
   knowledge, the true Church, and those in opinion, the Heretics.
   Nothing, then, can be more clearly seen than those, who know, making
   affirmations about what they know, and the others respecting what they
   hold on the strength of opinion, as far as respects affirmation without
   proof.

   They accordingly despise and laugh at one another. And it happens that
   the same thought is held in the highest estimation by some, and by
   others condemned for insanity. And, indeed, we have learned that
   voluptuousness, which is to be attributed to the Gentiles, is one
   thing; and wrangling, which is preferred among the heretical sects, is
   another; and joy, which is to be appropriated to the Church, another;
   and delight, which is to be assigned to the true Gnostic, another. And
   as, if one devote himself to Ischomachus, he will make him a farmer;
   and to Lampis, a mariner; and to Charidemus, a military commander; and
   to Simon, an equestrian; and to Perdices, a trader; and to Crobylus, a
   cook; and to Archelaus, a dancer; and to Homer, a poet; and to Pyrrho,
   a wrangler; and to Demosthenes, an orator; and to Chrysippus, a
   dialectician; and to Aristotle, a naturalist; and to Plato, a
   philosopher: so he who listens to the Lord, and follows the prophecy
   given by Him, will be formed perfectly in the likeness of the
   teacher--made a god going about in flesh. [3679]

   Accordingly, those fall from this eminence who follow not God whither
   He leads. And He leads us in the inspired Scriptures.

   Though men's actions are ten thousand in number, the sources of all sin
   are but two, ignorance and inability. And both depend on ourselves;
   inasmuch as we will not learn, nor, on the other hand, restrain lust.
   And of these, the one is that, in consequence of which people do not
   judge well, and the other that, in consequence of which they cannot
   comply with right judgments. For neither will one who is deluded in his
   mind be able to act rightly, though perfectly able to do what he knows;
   nor, though capable of judging what is requisite, will he keep himself
   free of blame, if destitute of power in action. Consequently, then,
   there are assigned two kinds of correction applicable to both kinds of
   sin: for the one, knowledge and clear demonstration from the testimony
   of the Scriptures; and for the other, the training according to the
   Word, which is regulated by the discipline of faith and fear. And both
   develop into perfect love. For the end of the Gnostic here is, in my
   judgment, twofold,--partly scientific contemplation, partly action.

   Would, then, that these heretics would learn and be set right by these
   notes, and turn to the sovereign God! But if, like the deaf serpents,
   they listen not to the song called new, though very old, may they be
   chastised by God, and undergo paternal admonitions previous to the
   Judgment, till they become ashamed and repent, but not rush through
   headlong unbelief, and precipitate themselves into judgment.

   For there are partial corrections, which are called chastisements,
   which many of us who have been in transgression incur, by falling away
   from the Lord's people. But as children are chastised by their teacher,
   or their father, so are we by Providence. But God does not punish, for
   punishment is retaliation for evil. He chastises, however, for good to
   those who are chastised, collectively and individually.

   I have adduced these things from a wish to avert those, who are eager
   to learn, from the liability to fall into heresies, and out of a desire
   to stop them from superficial ignorance, or stupidity, or bad
   disposition, or whatever it should be called. And in the attempt to
   persuade and lead to the truth those who are not entirely incurable, I
   have made use of these words. For there are some who cannot bear at all
   to listen to those who exhort them to turn to the truth; and they
   attempt to trifle, pouring out blasphemies against the truth, claiming
   for themselves the knowledge of the greatest things in the universe,
   without having learned, or inquired, or laboured, or discovered the
   consecutive train of ideas,--whom one should pity rather than hate for
   such perversity.

   But if one is curable, able to bear (like fire or steel) the
   outspokenness of the truth, which cuts away and burns their false
   opinions, let him lend the ears of the soul. And this will be the case,
   unless, through the propensity to sloth, they push truth away, or
   through the desire of fame, endeavour to invent novelties. For those
   are slothful who, having it in their power to provide themselves with
   proper proofs for the divine Scriptures from the Scriptures themselves,
   select only what contributes to their own pleasures. And those have a
   craving for glory who voluntarily evade, by arguments of a diverse
   sort, the things delivered by the blessed apostles and teachers, which
   are wedded to inspired words; opposing the divine tradition by human
   teachings, in order to establish the heresy. [3680] For, in truth, what
   remained to be said--in ecclesiastical knowledge I mean--by such men,
   Marcion, for example, or Prodicus, and such like, who did not walk in
   the right way? For they could not have surpassed their predecessors in
   wisdom, so as to discover anything in addition to what had been uttered
   by them; for they would have been satisfied had they been able to learn
   the things laid down before.

   Our Gnostic then alone, having grown old in the Scriptures, and
   maintaining apostolic and ecclesiastic orthodoxy in doctrines, lives
   most correctly in accordance with the Gospel, and discovers the proofs,
   for which he may have made search (sent forth as he is by the Lord),
   from the law and the prophets. For the life of the Gnostic, in my view,
   is nothing but deeds and words corresponding to the tradition of the
   Lord. But "all have not knowledge. For I would not have you to be
   ignorant, brethren," says the apostle, "that all were under the cloud,
   and partook of spiritual meat and drink;" [3681] clearly affirming that
   all who heard the word did not take in the magnitude of knowledge in
   deed and word. Wherefore also he added: "But with all of them He was
   not well pleased." Who is this? He who said, "Why do you call Me Lord,
   and do not the will of My Father?" [3682] That is the Saviour's
   teaching, which to us is spiritual food, and drink that knows no
   thirst, the water of gnostic life. Further it is said, knowledge is
   said "to puff up." To whom we say: Perchance seeming knowledge is said
   to puff up, if one [3683] suppose the expression means "to be swollen
   up." But if, as is rather the case, the expression of the apostle
   means, "to entertain great and true sentiments," the difficulty is
   solved. Following, then, the Scriptures, let us establish what has been
   said: "Wisdom," says Solomon, "has inflated her children." For the Lord
   did not work conceit by the particulars of His teaching; but He
   produces trust in the truth and expansion of mind, in the knowledge
   that is communicated by the Scriptures, and contempt for the things
   which drag into sin, which is the meaning of the expression "inflated."
   It teaches the magnificence of the wisdom implanted in her children by
   instruction. Now the apostle says, "I will know not the speech of those
   that are puffed up, but the power;" [3684] if ye understand the
   Scriptures magnanimously (which means truly; for nothing is greater
   than truth). For in that lies the power of the children of wisdom who
   are puffed up. He says, as it were, I shall know if ye rightly
   entertain great thoughts respecting knowledge. "For God," according to
   David, "is known in Judea," that is, those that are Israelites
   according to knowledge. For Judea is interpreted "Confession." It is,
   then, rightly said by the apostle, "This Thou, shall not commit
   adultery, Thou shall not steal, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be
   any other commandment, it is comprehended in this word, Thou shalt love
   thy neighbour as thyself." [3685]

   For we must never, as do those who follow the heresies, adulterate the
   truth, or steal the canon of the Church, by gratifying our own lusts
   and vanity, by defrauding our neighbours; whom above all it is our
   duty, in the exercise of love to them, to teach to adhere to the truth.
   It is accordingly expressly said, "Declare among the heathen His
   statutes," that they may not be judged, but that those who have
   previously given ear may be converted. But those who speak
   treacherously with their tongues have the penalties that are on record.

      Chapter XVII.--The Tradition of the Church Prior to that of the Heresies.

   Those, then, that adhere to impious words, and dictate them to others,
   inasmuch as they do not make a right but a perverse use of the divine
   words, neither themselves enter into the kingdom of heaven, nor permit
   those whom they have deluded to attain the truth. But not having the
   key of entrance, but a false (and as the common phrase expresses it), a
   counterfeit key (antikleis), by which they do not enter in as we enter
   in, through the tradition of the Lord, by drawing aside the curtain;
   but bursting through the side-door, and digging clandestinely through
   the wall of the Church, and stepping over the truth, they constitute
   themselves the Mystagogues [3687] of the soul of the impious.

   For that the human assemblies which they held were posterior to the
   Catholic Church [3688] requires not many words to show.

   For the teaching of our Lord at His advent, beginning with Augustus and
   Tiberius, was completed in the middle of the times of Tiberius. [3689]

   And that of the apostles, embracing the ministry of Paul, ends with
   Nero. It was later, in the times of Adrian the king, that those who
   invented the heresies arose; and they extended to the age of Antoninus
   the elder, as, for instance, Basilides, though he claims (as they
   boast) for his master, Glaucias, the interpreter of Peter.

   Likewise they allege that Valentinus was a hearer of Theudas. [3690]
   And he was the pupil of Paul. For Marcion, who arose in the same age
   with them, lived as an old man with the younger [3691] [heretics]. And
   after him Simon heard for a little the preaching of Peter.

   Such being the case, it is evident, from the high antiquity and perfect
   truth of the Church, that these later heresies, and those yet
   subsequent to them in time, were new inventions falsified [from the
   truth].

   From what has been said, then, it is my opinion that the true Church,
   that which is really ancient, is one, and that in it those who
   according to God's purpose are just, are enrolled. [3692] For from the
   very reason that God is one, and the Lord one, that which is in the
   highest degree honourable is lauded in consequence of its singleness,
   being an imitation of the one first principle. In the nature of the
   One, then, is associated in a joint heritage the one Church, which they
   strive to cut asunder into many sects.

   Therefore in substance and idea, in origin, in pre-eminence, we say
   that the ancient and Catholic [3693] Church is alone, collecting as it
   does into the unity of the one faith--which results from the peculiar
   Testaments, or rather the one Testament in different times by the will
   of the one God, through one Lord--those already ordained, whom God
   predestinated, knowing before the foundation of the world that they
   would be righteous.

   But the pre-eminence of the Church, as the principle of union, is, in
   its oneness, in this surpassing all things else, and having nothing
   like or equal to itself. But of this afterwards.

   Of the heresies, some receive their appellation from a [person's] name,
   as that which is called after Valentinus, and that after Marcion, and
   that after Basilides, although they boast of adducing the opinion of
   Matthew [without truth]; for as the teaching, so also the tradition of
   the apostles was one. Some take their designation from a place, as the
   Peratici; some from a nation, as the [heresy] of the Phrygians; some
   from an action, as that of the Encratites; and some from peculiar
   dogmas, as that of the Docetæ, and that of the Hærmatites; and some
   from suppositions, and from individuals they have honoured, as those
   called Cainists, and the Ophians; and some from nefarious practices and
   enormities, as those of the Simonians called Entychites.

   as on the whole the best way of solving the unquestionable difficulty
   here. If we retain Augoustou, the clause must then be made
   parenthetical, and the sense would be: "For the teaching of the Lord on
   His advent, beginning with Augustus and Tiberius (in the middle of the
   times of Augustus), was completed." The objection to this (not by any
   means conclusive) is, that it does not specify the end of the period.
   The first 15 years of the life of our Lord were the last 15 of the
   reign of Augustus; and in the 15th year of the reign of his successor
   Tiberius our Lord was baptized. Clement elsewhere broaches the singular
   opinion, that our Lord's ministry lasted only a year, and, consequently
   that He died in the year in which He was baptized. As Augustus reigned,
   according to one of the chronologies of Clement, 43, and according to
   the other 46 years 4 months 1 day, and Tiberius 22 or 26 years 6 months
   19 days, the period of the teacing of the Gospel specified above began
   during the reign of Augustus, and ended during the reign of Tiberius.

   [3691] Much learning and ingenuity have been expended on this sentence,
   which, read as it stands in the text, appears to state that Marcion was
   an old man while Baslides and Valentinus were young men; and that Simon
   (Magus) was posterior to them in time. Marcion was certainly not an old
   man when Valentinus and Basilides were young men, as they flourished in
   the first half of the second century, and he was born about the
   beginning of it. The difficulty in regard to Simon is really best got
   over by supposing the Clement, speaking of these heresiarchs in
   ascending order, describes Marcion as further back in time; which sense
   meth' on of course will bear, although it does seem somewhat harsh, as
   "after" thus means "before."

      Chapter XVIII--The Distinction Between Clean and Unclean Animals in the
      Law Symbolical of the Distinction Between the Church, and Jews, and
      Heretics.

   After showing a little peep-hole to those who love to contemplate the
   Church from the law of sacrifices respecting clean and unclean animals
   (inasmuch as thus the common Jews and the heretics are distinguished
   mystically from the divine Church), let us bring the discourse to a
   close.

   For such of the sacrifices as part the hoof, and ruminate, the
   Scripture represents as clean and acceptable to God; since the just
   obtain access to the Father and to the Son by faith. For this is the
   stability of those who part the hoof, those who study the oracles of
   God night and day, and ruminate them in the soul's receptacle for
   instructions; which gnostic exercise the Law expresses under the figure
   of the rumination of the clean animal. But such as have neither the one
   nor the other of those qualities it separates as unclean.

   Now those that ruminate, but do not part the hoof, indicate the
   majority of the Jews, who have indeed the oracles of God, but have not
   faith, and the step which, resting on the truth, conveys to the Father
   by the Son. Whence also this kind of cattle are apt to slip, not having
   a division in the foot, and not resting on the twofold support of
   faith. For "no man," it is said, "knoweth the Father, but he to whom
   the Son shall reveal Him." [3694]

   And again, those also are likewise unclean that part the hoof, but do
   not ruminate. [3695] For these point out the heretics, who indeed go
   upon the name of the Father and the Son, but are incapable of
   triturating and grinding down the clear declaration of the oracles, and
   who, besides, perform the works of righteousness coarsely and not with
   precision, if they perform them at all. To such the Lord says, "Why
   will ye call me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?" [3696]

   And those that neither part the hoof nor chew the cud are entirely
   unclean.


   "But ye Megareans," says Theognis, "are neither third, nor fourth,

   Nor twelfth, neither in reckoning nor in number,"

   "but as chaff which the wind drives away from the face of the earth,"
   [3697] and as a drop from a vessel." [3698]

   These points, then, having been formerly thoroughly treated, and the
   department of ethics having been sketched summarily in a fragmentary
   way, as we promised; and having here and there interspersed the dogmas
   which are the germs [3699] of true knowledge, so that the discovery of
   the sacred traditions may not be easy to any one of the uninitiated,
   let us proceed to what we promised.

   Now the Miscellanies are not like parts laid out, planted in regular
   order for the delight of the eye, but rather like an umbrageous and
   shaggy hill, planted with laurel, and ivy, and apples, and olives, and
   figs; the planting being purposely a mixture of fruit-bearing and
   fruitless trees, since the composition aims at concealment, on account
   of those that have the daring to pilfer and steal the ripe fruits; from
   which, however, the husbandmen, transplanting shoots and plants, will
   adorn a beautiful park and a delightful grove.

   The Miscellanies, then, study neither arrangement nor diction; since
   there are even cases in which the Greeks on purpose wish that ornate
   diction should be absent, and imperceptibly cast in the seed of dogmas,
   not according to the truth, rendering such as may read laborious and
   quick at discovery. For many and various are the baits for the various
   kinds of fishes.

   And now, after this seventh Miscellany of ours, we shall give the
   account of what follows in order from another commencement. [3700]

  Elucidations

      I.

   (Deception, cap. ix. [130]p. 538.)

   More and more, the casuistry exposed by Pascal in the Provincial
   Letters [3701] becomes an important subject for the investigation of
   Americans. Nobody who has any pretensions to scholarship can afford to
   be ignorant of these letters; for they belong to literature, and not
   merely to theology. But they belong in a sense to the past; not that
   "the Society of Jesus" has ceased to maintain all that Pascal has
   exposed, and to practice even worse, but that the Latin churches have,
   since the days of Pascal, been formally subjected to a system of
   casuistry, in some respects superficially reformed, but in all other
   respects radically bad, and corrosive to society. In Pascal's day this
   casuistry could only be charged upon individuals, and upon societies
   and communities: the Roman Church everywhere adopted it, but was not
   formally committed to it. But in the system of Liguori this corrupt
   morality has been made authoritative and dogmatic; so that in all the
   Latin churches it becomes the base of the confessional. For moral
   purposes, it is the Bible of the millions who resort to their
   confessors and "directors." These remarks, however, are here introduced
   merely with reference to the morals of Clement with regard to truth.
   [3702]

   I have briefly indicated, in the footnotes, the points which are to be
   noted in forming an opinion of our author's conceptions of this vital
   principle. They seem to me conformed to the Gospel; to the teachings of
   Him who allows no hair-splittings, but says, "Let your yea be yea, and
   your nay, nay." But, as the text stood in the Edinburgh translation, it
   did injustice to Clement in one passage, which I have modified. It
   reads, "He (the Gnostic) both thinks and speaks the truth, unless, at
   any time, medicinally, as a physician for the safety of the sick, he
   may lie, or tell an untruth." To this, Clement adds significantly,
   "according to the Sophists." That is to say, our author tolerates the
   Christian who has not got beyond the Sophists with respect to
   benevolent deceptions. As killing is not always murder, so some, even
   among stern moralists, have maintained that deception by word of mouth
   is not always lying. This is the extent to which Clement tolerates
   sophistry, and he goes on to demand the practice of truth in Gospel
   terms. Now, thank God, the English word "lie" is always infamous; and
   there is nothing like it, in this respect, in other languages. The
   Sophists themselves did not so understand the Greek word (pseudos),
   when they apply it to the benevolent deception of a physician, or to
   the untruths used benevolently with the insane. Nothing infamous
   attaches to the French word mensonge when used for what are deemed
   "innocent deceptions." With this whole system of sophistry I have no
   patience at all; but, in justice to the Sophists, let us not make them
   worse than they were. They did not understand that such deceptions were
   lies. Hence, for "lie," I have used the word deceive, correcting a
   needless rendering of the text, and one to which Clement should not be
   made to extend even a contemptuous toleration.

   In this respect, the holy Jeremy Taylor and Dr. Johnson go further than
   Clement, and seem to allow that benevolent deceptions may be innocent.
   Sanderson sustains a sterner morality, and is more generally accepted.
   Liguori's system is verbally as strong as the Gospel itself: lying is a
   mortal sin, and never justifiable. But, when he comes to the definition
   of a lie, it is made so feeble, that the worst liar that ever lived
   need never resort to it. He may practice all manner of subterfuge, and
   even perjury, without telling a lie. As, e.g., if he points up his
   sleeve, while he swears that he did not see the criminal there, he
   tells no lie: it is the business of the judge and jury to watch his
   fingers, etc.

      II.

   (True Gnostic, cap. x. p. 540, note 1.)

   This unfortunate word Gnostic hides the force of Clement's teaching,
   throughout this work. Here he virtually expounds it, and we see that it
   refers even more to the heart than to the head. It carries with it the
   conduct of life by knowledge; i.e., by "the true Light which lighteneth
   every man that cometh into the world." (See [131]p. 607, footnote.)

      III.

   (The Scriptures, cap. xvi. [132]p. 550, note 3.)

   The Primitive Fathers never dream of anything as dogma which cannot be
   proved by the Scriptures, save only that the apostolic traditions,
   clearly proved to be such, must be referred to in proving what is Holy
   Scripture. It is not possible to graft on this principle the slightest
   argument for any tradition not indisputably apostolic, so far as the de
   fide is concerned. Quod semper is the touchstone, in their conceptions,
   of all orthodoxy. No matter who may teach this or that, now or in any
   post-apostolic age, their test is Holy Scripture, and the inquiry, Was
   it always so taught and understood?

      Chapter I.--The Object of Philosophical and Theological Inquiry--The
      Discovery of Truth. [3703]

   But the most ancient of the philosophers were not carried away to
   disputing and doubting, much less are we, who are attached to the
   really true philosophy, on whom the Scripture enjoins examination and
   investigation. For it is the more recent of the Hellenic philosophers
   who, by empty and futile love of fame, are led into useless babbling in
   refuting and wrangling. But, on the contrary, the Barbarian philosophy,
   expelling all contention, said, "Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
   shall be opened unto you; ask, and it shall be given you." [3704]

   Accordingly, by investigation, the point proposed for inquiry and
   answer knocks at the door of truth, according to what appears. And on
   an opening being made through the obstacle in the process of
   investigation, there results scientific contemplation. To those who
   thus knock, according to my view, the subject under investigation is
   opened.

   And to those who thus ask questions, in the Scriptures, there is given
   from God (that at which they aim) the gift of the God-given knowledge,
   by way of comprehension, through the true illumination of logical
   investigation. For it is impossible to find, without having sought; or
   to have sought, without having examined; or to have examined, without
   having unfolded and opened up the question by interrogation, to produce
   distinctness; or again, to have gone through the whole investigation,
   without thereafter receiving as the prize the knowledge of the point in
   question.

   But it belongs to him who has sought, to find; and to him to seek, who
   thinks previously that he does not know. Hence drawn by desire to the
   discovery of what is good, he seeks thoughtfully, without love of
   strife or glory, asking, answering, and besides considering the
   statements made. For it is incumbent, in applying ourselves not only to
   the divine Scriptures, but also to common notions, to institute
   investigations, the discovery ceasing at some useful end.

   For another place and crowd await turbulent people, and forensic
   sophistries. But it is suitable for him, who is at once a lover and
   disciple of the truth, to be pacific even in investigations, advancing
   by scientific demonstration, without love of self, but with love of
   truth, to comprehensive knowledge.

      Chapter II.--The Necessity of Perspicuous Definition.

   What better or clearer method, for the commencement of instruction of
   this nature, can there be than discussion of the term advanced, so
   distinctly, that all who use the same language may follow it? Is the
   term for demonstration of such a kind as the word Blityri, which is a
   mere sound, signifying nothing? But how is it that neither does the
   philosopher, nor the orator,--no more does the judge,--adduce
   demonstration as a term that means nothing; nor is any of the
   contending parties ignorant of the fact, that the meaning does not
   exist?

   Philosophers, in fact, present demonstration as having a substantial
   existence, one in one way, another in another. Therefore, if one would
   treat aright of each question, he cannot carry back the discourse to
   another more generally admitted fundamental principle than what is
   admitted to be signified by the term by all of the same nation and
   language.

   Then, starting from this point, it is necessary to inquire if the
   proposition has this signification or not. And next, if it is
   demonstrated to have, it is necessary to investigate its nature
   accurately, of what kind it is, and whether it ever passes over the
   class assigned. And if it suffices not to say, absolutely, only that
   which one thinks (for one's opponent may equally allege, on the other
   side, what he likes); then what is stated must be confirmed. If the
   decision of it be carried back to what is likewise matter of dispute,
   and the decision of that likewise to another disputed point, it will go
   on ad infinitum, and will be incapable of demonstration. But if the
   belief of a point that is not admitted be carried back to one admitted
   by all, that is to be made the commencement of instruction. Every term,
   therefore, advanced for discussion is to be converted into an
   expression that is admitted by those that are parties in the
   discussion, to form the starting point for instruction, to lead the way
   to the discovery of the points under investigation. For example, let it
   be the term "sun" that is in question. Now the Stoics say that it is
   "an intellectual fire kindled from the waters of the sea." Is not the
   definition, consequently, obscurer than the term, requiring another
   demonstration to prove if it be true? It is therefore better to say, in
   the common and distinct form of speech, "that the brightest of the
   heavenly bodies is named the sun." For this expression is more credible
   and clearer, and is likewise admitted by all.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter III.--Demonstration Defined.

   Similarly, also, all men will admit that demonstration is discourse,
   [3705] agreeable to reason, producing belief in points disputed, from
   points admitted.

   Now, not only demonstration and belief and knowledge, but foreknowledge
   also, are used in a twofold manner. There is that which is scientific
   and certain, and that which is merely based on hope.

   In strict propriety, then, that is called demonstration which produces
   in the souls of learners scientific belief. The other kind is that
   which merely leads to opinion. As also, both he that is really a man,
   possessing common judgment, and he that is savage and brutal,--each is
   a man. Thus also the Comic poet said that "man is graceful, so long as
   he is man." The same holds with ox, horse, and dog, according to the
   goodness or badness of the animal. For by looking to the perfection of
   the genus, we come to those meanings that are strictly proper. For
   instance, we conceive of a physician who is deficient in no element of
   the power of healing, and a Gnostic who is defective in no element of
   scientific knowledge.

   Now demonstration differs from syllogism; inasmuch as the point
   demonstrated is indicative of one thing, being one and identical; as we
   say that to be with child is the proof of being no longer a virgin. But
   what is apprehended by syllogism, though one thing, follows from
   several; as, for example, not one but several proofs are adduced of
   Pytho having betrayed the Byzantines, if such was the fact. And to draw
   a conclusion from what is admitted is to syllogize; while to draw a
   conclusion from what is true is to demonstrate.

   So that there is a compound advantage of demonstration: from its
   assuming, for the proof of points in question, true premisses, and from
   its drawing the conclusion that follows from them. If the first have no
   existence, but the second follow from the first, one has not
   demonstrated, but syllogized. For, to draw the proper conclusion from
   the premisses, is merely to syllogize. But to have also each of the
   premisses true, is not merely to have syllogized, but also to have
   demonstrated.

   And to conclude, as is evident from the word, is to bring to the
   conclusion. And in every train of reasoning, the point sought to be
   determined is the end, which is also called the conclusion. But no
   simple and primary statement is termed a syllogism, although true; but
   it is compounded of three such, at the least,--of two as premisses, and
   one as conclusion.

   Now, either all things require demonstration, or some of them are
   self-evident. But if the first, by demanding the demonstration of each
   demonstration we shall go on ad infinitum; and so demonstration is
   subverted. But if the second, those things which are self-evident will
   become the starting points [and fundamental grounds] of demonstration.

   In point of fact, the philosophers admit that the first principles of
   all things are indemonstrable. So that if there is demonstration at
   all, there is an absolute necessity that there be something that is
   self-evident, which is called primary and indemonstrable.

   Consequently all demonstration is traced up to indemonstrable faith.
   [3706]

   It will also turn out that there are other starting points for
   demonstrations, after the source which takes its rise in faith,--the
   things which appear clearly to sensation and understanding. For the
   phenomena of sensation are simple, and incapable of being decompounded;
   but those of understanding are simple, rational, and primary. But those
   produced from them are compound, but no less clear and reliable, and
   having more to do with the reasoning faculty than the first. For
   therefore the peculiar native power of reason, which we all have by
   nature, deals with agreement and disagreement. If, then, any argument
   be found to be of such a kind, as from points already believed to be
   capable of producing belief in what is not yet believed, we shall aver
   that this is the very essence of demonstration.

   Now it is affirmed that the nature of demonstration, as that of belief,
   is twofold: that which produces in the souls of the hearers persuasion
   merely, and that which produces knowledge.

   If, then, one begins with the things which are evident to sensation and
   understanding, and then draw the proper conclusion, he truly
   demonstrates. But if [he begin] with things which are only probable and
   not primary, that is evident neither to sense nor understanding, and if
   he draw the right conclusion, he will syllogize indeed, but not produce
   a scientific demonstration; but if [he draw] not the right conclusion,
   he will not syllogize at all.

   Now demonstration differs from analysis. For each one of the points
   demonstrated, is demonstrated by means of points that are demonstrated;
   those having been previously demonstrated by others; till we get back
   to those which are self-evident, or to those evident to sense and to
   understanding; which is called Analysis. But demonstration is, when the
   point in question reaches us through all the intermediate steps. The
   man, then, who practices demonstration, ought to give great attention
   to the truth, while he disregards the terms of the premisses, whether
   you call them axioms, or premisses, or assumptions. Similarly, also,
   special attention must be paid to what suppositions a conclusion is
   based on; while he may be quite careless as to whether one choose to
   term it a conclusive or syllogistic proposition.

   For I assert that these two things must be attended to by the man who
   would demonstrate--to assume true premisses, and to draw from them the
   legitimate conclusion, which some also call "the inference," as being
   what is inferred from the premisses.

   Now in each proposition respecting a question there must be different
   premisses, related, however, to the proposition laid down; and what is
   advanced must be reduced to definition. And this definition must be
   admitted by all. But when premisses irrelevant to the proposition to be
   established are assumed, it is impossible to arrive at any right
   result; the entire proposition--which is also called the question of
   its nature--being ignored.

   In all questions, then, there is something which is previously
   known,--that which being self-evident is believed without
   demonstration; which must be made the starting point in their
   investigation, and the criterion of apparent results.

     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter IV.--To Prevent Ambiguity, We Must Begin with Clear Definition.

   For every question is solved from pre-existing knowledge. And the
   knowledge pre-existing of each object of investigation is sometimes
   merely of the essence, while its functions are unknown (as of stones,
   and plants, and animals, of whose operations we are ignorant), or [the
   knowledge] of the properties, or powers, or (so to speak) of the
   qualities inherent in the objects. And sometimes we may know some one
   or more of those powers or properties,--as, for example, the desires
   and affections of the soul,--and be ignorant of the essence, and make
   it the object of investigation. But in many instances, our
   understanding having assumed all these, the question is, in which of
   the essences do they thus inhere; for it is after forming conceptions
   of both--that is, both of essence and operation--in our mind, that we
   proceed to the question. And there are also some objects, whose
   operations, along with their essences, we know, but are ignorant of
   their modifications.

   Such, then, is the method of the discovery [of truth]. For we must
   begin with the knowledge of the questions to be discussed. For often
   the form of the expression deceives and confuses and disturbs the mind,
   so that it is not easy to discover to what class the thing is to be
   referred; as, for example, whether the foetus be an animal. For, having
   a conception of an animal and a foetus, we inquire if it be the case
   that the foetus is an animal; that is, if the substance which is in the
   foetal state possesses the power of motion, and of sensation besides.
   So that the inquiry is regarding functions and sensations in a
   substance previously known. Consequently the man who proposes the
   question is to be first asked, what he calls an animal. Especially is
   this to be done whenever we find the same term applied to various
   purposes; and we must examine whether what is signified by the term is
   disputed, or admitted by all. For were one to say that he calls
   whatever grows and is fed an animal, we shall have again to ask
   further, whether he considered plants to be animals; and then, after
   declaring himself to this effect, he must show what it is which is in
   the foetal state, and is nourished.

   For Plato calls plants animals, as partaking of the third species of
   life alone, that of appetency. [3707] But Aristotle, while he thinks
   that plants are possessed of a life of vegetation and nutrition, does
   not consider it proper to call them animals; for that alone, which
   possesses the other life--that of sensation--he considers warrantable
   to be called an animal. The Stoics do not call the power of vegetation,
   life.

   Now, on the man who proposes the question denying that plants are
   animals, we shall show that he affirms what contradicts himself. For,
   having defined the animal by the fact of its nourishment and growth,
   but having asserted that a plant is not an animal, it appears that he
   says nothing else than that what is nourished and grows is both an
   animal and not an animal.

   Let him, then, say what he wants to learn. Is it whether what is in the
   womb grows and is nourished, or is it whether it possesses any
   sensation or movement by impulse? For, according to Plato, the plant is
   animate, and an animal; but, according to Aristotle, not an animal, for
   it wants sensation, but is animate. Therefore, according to him, an
   animal is an animate sentient being. But according to the Stoics, a
   plant is neither animate nor an animal; for an animal is an animate
   being. If, then, an animal is animate, and life is sentient nature, it
   is plain that what is animate is sentient. If, then, he who has put the
   question, being again interrogated if he still calls the animal in the
   foetal state an animal on account of its being nourished and growing,
   he has got his answer.

   But were he to say that the question he asks is, whether the foetus is
   already sentient, or capable of moving itself in consequence of any
   impulse, the investigation of the matter becomes clear, the fallacy in
   the name no longer remaining. But if he do not reply to the
   interrogation, and will not say what he means, or in respect of what
   consideration it is that he applies the term "animal" in propounding
   the question, but bids us define it ourselves, let him be noted as
   disputatious.

   But as there are two methods, one by question and answer, and the other
   the method of exposition, if he decline the former, let him listen to
   us, while we expound all that bears on the problem. Then when we have
   done, he may treat of each point in turn. But if he attempt to
   interrupt the investigation by putting questions, he plainly does not
   want to hear.

   But if he choose to reply, let him first be asked, To what thing he
   applies the name, animal. And when he has answered this, let him be
   again asked, what, in his view, the foetus means, whether that which is
   in the womb, or things already formed and living; and again, if the
   foetus means the seed deposited, or if it is only when members and a
   shape are formed that the name of embryos is to be applied. And on his
   replying to this, it is proper that the point in hand be reasoned out
   to a conclusion, in due order, and taught.

   But if he wishes us to speak without him answering, let him hear. Since
   you will not say in what sense you allege what you have propounded (for
   I would not have thus engaged in a discussion about meanings, but I
   would now have looked at the things themselves), know that you have
   done just as if you had propounded the question, Whether a dog were an
   animal? For I might have rightly said, Of what dog do you speak? For I
   shall speak of the land dog and the sea dog, and the constellation in
   heaven, and of Diogenes too, and all the other dogs in order. For I
   could not divine whether you inquire about all or about some one. What
   you shall do subsequently is to learn now, and say distinctly what it
   is that your question is about. Now if you are shuffling about names,
   it is plain to everybody that the name foetus is neither an animal nor
   a plant, but a name, and a sound, and a body, and a being, and anything
   and everything rather than an animal. And if it is this that you have
   propounded, you are answered.

   But neither is that which is denoted by the name foetus an animal. But
   that is incorporeal, and may be called a thing and a notion, and
   everything rather than an animal. The nature of an animal is different.
   For it was clearly shown respecting the very point in question, I mean
   the nature of the embryo, of what sort it is. The question respecting
   the meanings expressed by the name animal is different.

   I say, then, if you affirm that an animal is what has the power of
   sensation and of moving itself from appetency, that an animal is not
   simply what moves through appetency and is possessed of sensation. For
   it is also capable of sleeping, or, when the objects of sensation are
   not present, of not exercising the power of sensation. But the natural
   power of appetency or of sensation is the mark of an animal. For
   something of this nature is indicated by these things. First, if the
   foetus is not capable of sensation or motion from appetency; which is
   the point proposed for consideration. Another point is; if the foetus
   is capable of ever exercising the power of sensation or moving through
   appetency. In which sense no one makes it a question, since it is
   evident.

   But the question was, whether the embryo is already an animal, or still
   a plant. And then the name animal was reduced to definition, for the
   sake of perspicuity. But having discovered that it is distinguished
   from what is not an animal by sensation and motion from appetency; we
   again separated this from its adjuncts; asserting that it was one thing
   for that to be such potentially, which is not yet possessed of the
   power of sensation and motion, but will some time be so, and another
   thing to be already so actually; and in the case of such, it is one
   thing to exert its powers, another to be able to exert them, but to be
   at rest or asleep. And this is the question.

   For the embryo is not to be called an animal from the fact that it is
   nourished; which is the allegation of those who turn aside from the
   essence of the question, and apply their minds to what happens
   otherwise. But in the case of all conclusions alleged to be found out,
   demonstration is applied in common, which is discourse (logos),
   establishing one thing from others. But the grounds from which the
   point in question is to be established, must be admitted and known by
   the learner. And the foundation of all these is what is evident to
   sense and to intellect.

   Accordingly the primary demonstration is composed of all these. But the
   demonstration which, from points already demonstrated thereby,
   concludes some other point, is no less reliable than the former. It
   cannot be termed primary, because the conclusion is not drawn from
   primary principles as premisses.

   The first species, then, of the different kinds of questions, which are
   three, has been exhibited--I mean that, in which the essence being
   known, some one of its powers or properties is unknown. The second
   variety of propositions was that in which we all know the powers and
   properties, but do not know the essence; as, for example, in what part
   of the body is the principal faculty of the soul.

      Chapter V.--Application of Demonstration to Sceptical Suspense of
      Judgment.

   Now the same treatment which applies to demonstration applies also to
   the following question.

   Some, for instance, say that there cannot be several originating causes
   for one animal. It is impossible that there can be several homogeneous
   originating causes of an animal; but that there should be several
   heterogeneous, is not absurd.

   Suppose the Pyrrhonian suspense of judgment, as they say, [the idea]
   that nothing is certain: it is plain that, beginning with itself, it
   first invalidates itself. It either grants that something is true, that
   you are not to suspend your judgment on all things; or it persists in
   saying that there is nothing true. And it is evident, that first it
   will not be true. For it either affirms what is true or it does not
   affirm what is true. But if it affirms what is true, it concedes,
   though unwillingly, that something is true. And if it does not affirm
   what is true, it leaves true what it wished to do away with. For, in so
   far as the scepticism which demolishes is proved false, in so far the
   positions which are being demolished, are proved true; like the dream
   which says that all dreams are false. For in confuting itself, it is
   confirmatory of the others.

   And, in fine, if it is true, it will make a beginning with itself, and
   not be scepticism of anything else but of itself first. Then if [such a
   man] apprehends that he is a man, or that he is sceptical, it is
   evident that he is not sceptical. [3708] And how shall he reply to the
   interrogation? For he is evidently no sceptic in respect to this. Nay,
   he affirms even that he does doubt.

   And if we must be persuaded to suspend our judgment in regard to
   everything, we shall first suspend our judgment in regard to our
   suspense of judgment itself, whether we are to credit it or not.

   And if this position is true, that we do not know what is true, then
   absolutely nothing is allowed to be true by it. But if he will say that
   even this is questionable, whether we know what is true; by this very
   statement he grants that truth is knowable, in the very act of
   appearing to establish the doubt respecting it.

   But if a philosophical sect is a leaning toward dogmas, or, according
   to some, a leaning to a number of dogmas which have consistency with
   one another and with phenomena, tending to a right life; and dogma is a
   logical conception, and conception is a state and assent of the mind:
   not merely sceptics, but every one who dogmatizes is accustomed in
   certain things to suspend his judgment, either through want of strength
   of mind, or want of clearness in the things, or equal force in the
   reasons.

      Chapter VI.--Definitions, Genera, and Species.

   The introductions and sources of questions are about these points and
   in them.

   But before definitions, and demonstrations, and divisions, it must be
   propounded in what ways the question is stated; and equivocal terms are
   to be treated; and synomyms stated accurately according to their
   significations.

   Then it is to be inquired whether the proposition belongs to those
   points, which are considered in relation to others, or is taken by
   itself. Further, If it is, what it is, what happens to it; or thus,
   also, if it is, what it is, why it is. And to the consideration of
   these points, the knowledge of Particulars and Universals, and the
   Antecedents and the Differences, and their divisions, contribute.

   Now, Induction aims at generalization and definition; and the divisions
   are the species, and what a thing is, and the individual. The
   contemplation of the How adduces the assumption of what is peculiar;
   and doubts bring the particular differences and the demonstrations, and
   otherwise augment the speculation and its consequences; and the result
   of the whole is scientific knowledge and truth.

   Again, the summation resulting from Division becomes Definition. For
   Definition is adopted before division and after: before, when it is
   admitted or stated; after, when it is demonstrated. And by Sensation
   the Universal is summed up from the Particular. For the starting point
   of Induction is Sensation; and the end is the Universal.

   Induction, accordingly, shows not what a thing is, but that it is, or
   is not. Division shows what it is; and Definition similarly with
   Division teaches the essence and what a thing is, but not if it is;
   while Demonstration explains the three points, if it is, what it is,
   and why it is.

   There are also Definitions which contain the Cause. And since it may be
   known when we see, when we see the Cause; and Causes are four--the
   matter, the moving power, the species, the end; Definition will be
   fourfold.

   Accordingly we must first take the genus, in which are the points that
   are nearest those above; and after this the next difference. And the
   succession of differences, when cut and divided, completes the "What it
   is." There is no necessity for expressing all the differences of each
   thing, but those which form the species.

   Geometrical analysis and synthesis are similar to logical division and
   definition; and by division we get back to what is simple and more
   elementary. We divide, therefore, the genus of what is proposed for
   consideration into the species contained in it; as, in the case of man,
   we divide animal, which is the genus, into the species that appear in
   it, the mortal, and the immortal. And thus, by continually dividing
   those genera that seem to be compound into the simpler species, we
   arrive at the point which is the subject of investigation, and which is
   incapable of further division.

   For, after dividing "the animal" into mortal and immortal, then into
   terrestrial and aquatic; and the terrestrial again into those who fly
   and those who walk; and so dividing the species which is nearest to
   what is sought, which also contains what is sought, we arrive by
   division at the simplest species, which contains nothing else, but what
   is sought alone.

   For again we divide that which walks into rational and irrational; and
   then selecting from the species, apprehended by division, those next to
   man, and combining them into one formula, we state the definition of a
   man, who is an animal, mortal, terrestrial, walking, rational.

   Whence Division furnishes the class of matter, seeking for the
   definition the simplicity of the name; and the definition of the
   artisan and maker, by composition and construction, presents the
   knowledge of the thing as it is; not of those things of which we have
   general notions. To these notions we say that explanatory expressions
   belong. For to these notions, also, divisions are applicable.

   Now one Division divides that which is divided into species, as a
   genus; and another into parts, as a whole; and another into accidents.

   The division, then, of a whole into the parts, is, for the most part,
   conceived with reference to magnitude; that into the accidents can
   never be entirely explicated, if, necessarily, essence is inherent in
   each of the existences.

   Whence both these divisions are to be rejected, and only the division
   of the genus into species is approved, by which both the identity that
   is in the genus is characterized, and the diversity which subsists in
   the specific differences.

   The species is always contemplated in a part. On the other hand,
   however, if a thing is part of another, it will not be also a species.
   For the hand is a part of a man, but it is not a species. And the genus
   exists in the species. For [the genus] is both in man and the ox. But
   the whole is not in the parts. For the man is not in his feet.
   Wherefore also the species is more important than the part; and
   whatever things are predicated of the genus will be all predicated of
   the species.

   It is best, then, to divide the genus into two, if not into three
   species. The species then being divided more generically, are
   characterized by sameness and difference. And then being divided, they
   are characterized by the points generically indicated.

   For each of the species is either an essence; as when we say, Some
   substances are corporeal and some incorporeal; or how much, or what
   relation, or where, or when, or doing, or suffering.

   One, therefore, will give the definition of whatever he possesses the
   knowledge of; as one can by no means be acquainted with that which he
   cannot embrace and define in speech. And in consequence of ignorance of
   the definition, the result is, that many disputes and deceptions arise.
   For if he that knows the thing has the knowledge of it in his mind, and
   can explain by words what he conceives; and if the explanation of the
   thought is definition; then he that knows the thing must of necessity
   be able also to give the definition.

   Now in definitions, difference is assumed, which, in the definition,
   occupies the place of sign. The faculty of laughing, accordingly, being
   added to the definition of man, makes the whole--a rational, mortal,
   terrestrial, walking, laughing animal. For the things added by way of
   difference to the definition are the signs of the properties of things;
   but do not show the nature of the things themselves. Now they say that
   the difference is the assigning of what is peculiar; and as that which
   has the difference differs from all the rest, that which belongs to it
   alone, and is predicated conversely of the thing, must in definitions
   be assumed by the first genus as principal and fundamental.

   Accordingly, in the larger definitions the number of the species that
   are discovered are in the ten Categories; and in the least, the
   principal points of the nearest species being taken, mark the essence
   and nature of the thing. But the least consists of three, the genus and
   two essentially necessary species. And this is done for the sake of
   brevity.

   We say, then, Man is the laughing animal. And we must assume that which
   pre-eminently happens to what is defined, or its peculiar virtue, or
   its peculiar function, and the like.

   Accordingly, while the definition is explanatory of the essence of the
   thing, it is incapable of accurately comprehending its nature. By means
   of the principal species, the definition makes an exposition of the
   essence, and almost has the essence in the quality.

      Chapter VII.--On the Causes of Doubt or Assent.

   The causes productive of scepticism are two things principally. One is
   the changefulness and instability of the human mind, whose nature it is
   to generate dissent, either that of one with another, or that of people
   with themselves. And the second is the discrepancy which is in things;
   which, as to be expected, is calculated to be productive of scepticism.

   For, being unable either to believe in all views, on account of their
   conflicting nature; or to disbelieve all, because that which says that
   all are untrustworthy is included in the number of those that are so;
   or to believe some and disbelieve others on account of the equipoise,
   we are led to scepticism.

   But among the principal causes of scepticism is the instability of the
   mind, which is productive of dissent. And dissent is the proximate
   cause of doubt. Whence life is full of tribunals and councils; and, in
   fine, of selection in what is said to be good and bad; which are the
   signs of a mind in doubt, and halting through feebleness on account of
   conflicting matters. And there are libraries full of books, [3709] and
   compilations and treatises of those who differ in dogmas, and are
   confident that they themselves know the truth that there is in things.

      Chapter VIII.--The Method of Classifying Things and Names.

   In language there are three things:--Names, which are primarily the
   symbols of conceptions, and by consequence also of subjects. Second,
   there are Conceptions, which are the likenesses and impressions of the
   subjects. Whence in all, the conceptions are the same; in consequence
   of the same impression being produced by the subjects in all. But the
   names are not so, on account of the difference of languages. And
   thirdly, the Subject-matters by which the Conceptions are impressed in
   us.

   The names are reduced by grammar into the twenty-four general elements;
   for the elements must be determined. For of Particulars there is no
   scientific knowledge, seeing they are infinite. But it is the property
   of science to rest on general and defined principles. Whence also
   Particulars are resolved into Universals. And philosophic research is
   occupied with Conceptions and Real subjects. But since of these the
   Particulars are infinite, some elements have been found, under which
   every subject of investigation is brought; and if it be shown to enter
   into any one or more of the elements, we prove it to exist; but if it
   escape them all, that it does not exist.

   Of things stated, some are stated without connection; as, for example,
   "man" and "runs," and whatever does not complete a sentence, which is
   either true or false. And of things stated in connection, some point
   out "essence," some "quality," some "quantity," some "relation," some
   "where," some "when," some "position," some "possession," some
   "action," some "suffering," which we call the elements of material
   things after the first principles. For these are capable of being
   contemplated by reason.

   But immaterial things are capable of being apprehended by the mind
   alone, by primary application.

   And of those things that are classed under the ten Categories, some are
   predicated by themselves (as the nine Categories), and others in
   relation to something.

   And, again, of the things contained under these ten Categories, some
   are Univocal, as ox and man, as far as each is an animal. For those are
   Univocal terms, to both of which belongs the common name, animal; and
   the same principle, that is definition, that is animate essence. And
   Heteronyms are those which relate to the same subject under different
   names, as ascent or descent; for the way is the same whether upwards or
   downwards. And the other species of Heteronyms, as horse and black, are
   those which have a different name and definition from each other, and
   do not possess the same subject. But they are to be called different,
   not Heteronyms. And Polyonyms are those which have the same definition,
   but a different name, as, hanger, sword, scimitar. And Paronyms are
   those which are named from something different, as "manly" from
   "manliness."

   Equivocal terms have the same name, but not the same definition, as
   man--both the animal and the picture. Of Equivocal terms, some receive
   their Equivocal name fortuitously, as Ajax, the Locrian, and the
   Salaminian; and some from intention; and of these, some from
   resemblance, as man both the living and the painted; and some from
   analogy, as the foot of Mount Ida, and our foot, because they are
   beneath; some from action, as the foot of a vessel, by which the vessel
   sails, and our foot, by which we move. Equivocal terms are designated
   from the same and to the same; as the book and scalpel are called
   surgical, both from the surgeon who uses them and with reference to the
   surgical matter itself.
     __________________________________________________________________

      Chapter IX.--On the Different Kinds of Cause.

   Of Causes, some are Procatarctic and some Synectic, some Co-operating,
   some Causes sine quâ non.

   Those that afford the occasion of the origin of anything first, are
   Procatarctic; as beauty is the cause of love to the licentious; for
   when seen by them, it alone produces the amorous inclination, but not
   necessarily.

   Causes are Synectic (which are also univocally perfect of themselves)
   whenever a cause is capable of producing the effect of itself,
   independently.

   Now all the causes may be shown in order in the case of the learner.
   The father is the Procatarctic cause of learning, the teacher the
   Synectic, and the nature of the learner the cooperating cause, and time
   holds the relation of the Cause sine quâ non.

   Now that is properly called a cause which is capable of effecting
   anything actively; since we say that steel is capable of cutting, not
   merely while cutting, but also while not cutting. Thus, then, the
   capability of causing (to parektikon) signifies both; both that which
   is now acting, and that which is not yet acting, but which possesses
   the power of acting.

   Some, then, say that causes are properties of bodies; and others of
   incorporeal substances; others say that the body is properly speaking
   cause, and that what is incorporeal is so only catachrestically, and a
   quasi-cause. Others, again, reverse matters, saying that corporeal
   substances are properly causes, and bodies are so improperly; as, for
   example, that cutting, which is an action, is incorporeal, and is the
   cause of cutting which is an action and incorporeal, and, in the case
   of bodies, of being cut,--as in the case of the sword and what is cut
   [by it].

   The cause of things is predicated in a threefold manner. One, What the
   cause is, as the statuary; a second, Of what it is the cause of
   becoming, a statue; and a third, To what it is the cause, as, for
   example, the material: for he is the cause to the brass of becoming a
   statue. The being produced, and the being cut, which are causes to what
   they belong, being actions, are incorporeal.

   According to which principle, causes belong to the class of predicates
   (kategorematon), or, as others say, of dicta (lekton) (for Cleanthes
   and Archedemus call predicates dicta); or rather, some causes will be
   assigned to the class of predicates, as that which is cut, whose case
   is to be cut; and some to that of axioms,--as, for example, that of a
   ship being made, whose case again is, that a ship is constructing. Now
   Aristotle denominates the name of such things as a house, a ship,
   burning, cutting, an appellative. But the case is allowed to be
   incorporeal. Therefore that sophism is solved thus: What you say passes
   through your mouth. Which is true. You name a house. Therefore a house
   passes through your mouth. Which is false. For we do not speak the
   house, which is a body, but the case, in which the house is, which is
   incorporeal.

   And we say that the house-builder builds the house, in reference to
   that which is to be produced. So we say that the cloak is woven; for
   that which makes is the indication of the operation. That which makes
   is not the attribute of one, and the cause that of another, but of the
   same, both in the case of the cloak and of the house. For, in as far as
   one is the cause of anything being produced, in so far is he also the
   maker of it. Consequently, the cause, and that which makes, and that
   through which (di ho), are the same. Now, if anything is "a cause" and
   "that which effects," it is certainly also "that through which." But if
   a thing is "that through which," it does not by any means follow that
   it is also "the cause." Many things, for instance, concur in one
   result, through which the end is reached; but all are not causes. For
   Medea would not have killed her children, had she not been enraged. Nor
   would she have been enraged, had she not been jealous. Nor would she
   have been this, if she had not loved. Nor would she have loved, had not
   Jason sailed to Colchi. Nor would this have taken place, had the Argo
   not been built. Nor would this have taken place, had not the timbers
   been cut from Pelion. For though in all these things there is the case
   of "that through which," they are not all "causes" of the murder of the
   children, but only Medea was the cause. Wherefore, that which does not
   hinder does not act. Wherefore, that which does not hinder is not a
   cause, but that which hinders is. For it is in acting and doing
   something that the cause is conceived.

   Besides, what does not hinder is separated from what takes place; but
   the cause is related to the event. That, therefore, which does not
   hinder cannot be a cause. Wherefore, then, it is accomplished, because
   that which can hinder is not present. Causation is then predicated in
   four ways: The efficient cause, as the statuary; and the material, as
   the brass; and the form, as the character; and the end, as the honour
   of the Gymnasiarch.

   The relation of the cause sine quâ non is held by the brass in
   reference to the production of the statue; and likewise it is a [true]
   cause. For everything without which the effect is incapable of being
   produced, is of necessity a cause; but a cause not absolutely. For the
   cause sine quâ non is not Synectic, but Co-operative. And everything
   that acts produces the effect, in conjunction with the aptitude of that
   which is acted on. For the cause disposes. But each thing is affected
   according to its natural constitution; the aptitude being causative,
   and occupying the place of causes sine quâ non. Accordingly, the cause
   is inefficacious without the aptitude; and is not a cause, but a
   co-efficient. For all causation is conceived in action. Now the earth
   could not make itself, so that it could not be the cause of itself. And
   it were ridiculous to say that the fire was not the cause of the
   burning, but the logs,--or the sword of the cutting, but the flesh,--or
   the strength of the antagonist the cause of the athlete being
   vanquished, but his own weakness.

   The Synectic cause does not require time. For the cautery produces pain
   at the instant of its application to the flesh. Of Procatarctic causes,
   some require time till the effect be produced, and others do not
   require it, as the case of fracture.

   Are not these called independent of time, not by way of privation, but
   of diminution, as that which is sudden, not that which has taken place
   without time?

   Every cause, apprehended by the mind as a cause, is occupied with
   something, and is conceived in relation to something; that is, some
   effect, as the sword for cutting; and to some object, as possessing an
   aptitude, as the fire to the wood. For it will not burn steel. The
   cause belongs to the things which have relation to something. For it is
   conceived in its relation to another thing. So that we apply our minds
   to the two, that we may conceive the cause as a cause.

   The same relation holds with the creator, and maker, and father. A
   thing is not the cause of itself. Nor is one his own father. For so the
   first would become the second. Now the cause acts and affects. That
   which is produced by the cause is acted on and is affected. But the
   same thing taken by itself cannot both act and be affected, nor can one
   be son and father. And otherwise the cause precedes in being what is
   done by it, as the sword, the cutting. And the same thing cannot
   precede at the same instant as to matter, as it is a cause, and at the
   same time, also, be after and posterior as the effect of a cause.

   Now being differs from becoming, as the cause from the effect, the
   father from the son. For the same thing cannot both be and become at
   the same instant; and consequently it is not the cause of itself.
   Things are not causes of one another, but causes to each other. For the
   splenetic affection preceding is not the cause of fever, but of the
   occurrence of fever; and the fever which precedes is not the cause of
   spleen, but of the affection increasing.

   Thus also the virtues are causes to each other, because on account of
   their mutual correspondence they cannot be separated. And the stones in
   the arch are causes of its continuing in this category, but are not the
   causes of one another. And the teacher and the learner are to one
   another causes of progressing as respects the predicate.

   And mutual and reciprocal causes are predicated, some of the same
   things, as the merchant and the retailer are causes of gain; and
   sometimes one of one thing and others of another, as the sword and the
   flesh; for the one is the cause to the flesh of being cut, and the
   flesh to the sword of cutting. [It is well said,] "An eye for an eye,
   life for life." For he who has wounded another mortally, is the cause
   to him of death, or of the occurrence of death. But on being mortally
   wounded by him in turn, he has had him as a cause in turn, not in
   respect of being a cause to him, but in another respect. For he becomes
   the cause of death to him, not that it was death returned the mortal
   stroke, but the wounded man himself. So that he was the cause of one
   thing, and had another cause. And he who has done wrong becomes the
   cause to another, to him who has been wronged. But the law which
   enjoins punishment to be inflicted is the cause not of injury, but to
   the one of retribution, to the other of discipline. So that the things
   which are causes, are not causes to each other as causes.

   It is still asked, if many things in conjunction become many causes of
   one thing. For the men who pull together are the causes of the ship
   being drawn down; but along with others, unless what is a joint cause
   be a cause.

   Others say, if there are many causes, each by itself becomes the cause
   of one thing. For instance, the virtues, which are many, are causes of
   happiness, which is one; and of warmth and pain, similarly, the causes
   are many. Are not, then, the many virtues one in power, and the sources
   of warmth and of pain so, also? and does not the multitude of the
   virtues, being one in kind, become the cause of the one result,
   happiness?

   But, in truth, Procatarctic causes are more than one both generically
   and specifically; as, for example, cold, weakness, fatigue, dyspepsia,
   drunkenness, generically, of any disease; and specifically, of fever.
   But Synectic causes are so, generically alone, and not also
   specifically.

   For of pleasant odour, which is one thing genetically, there are many
   specific causes, as frankincense, rose, crocus, styrax, myrrh,
   ointment. For the rose has not the same kind of sweet fragrance as
   myrrh.

   And the same thing becomes the cause of contrary effects; sometimes
   through the magnitude of the cause and its power, and sometimes in
   consequence of the susceptibility of that on which it acts. According
   to the nature of the force, the same string, according to its tension
   or relaxation, gives a shrill or deep sound. And honey is sweet to
   those who are well, and bitter to those who are in fever, according to
   the state of susceptibility of those who are affected. And one and the
   same wine inclines some to rage, and others to merriment. And the same
   sun melts wax and hardens clay.

   Further, of causes, some are apparent; others are grasped by a process
   of reasoning; others are occult; others are inferred analogically.

   And of causes that are occult, some are occult temporarily, being
   hidden at one time, and at another again seen clearly; and some are
   occult by nature, and capable of becoming at no time visible. And of
   those who are so by nature, some are capable of being apprehended; and
   these some would not call occult, being apprehended by analogy, through
   the medium of signs, as, for example, the symmetry of the passages of
   the senses, which are contemplated by reason. And some are not capable
   of being apprehended; which cannot in any mode fall under apprehension;
   which are by their very definition occult.

   Now some are Procatarctic, some Synectic, some Joint-causes, some
   Co-operating causes. And there are some according to nature, some
   beyond nature. And there are some of disease and by accident, some of
   sensations, some of the greatness of these, some of times and of
   seasons.

   Procatarctic causes being removed, the effect remains. But a Synectic
   cause is that, which being present, the effect remains, and being
   removed, the effect is removed.

   The Synectic is also called by the synonymous expression "perfect in
   itself." Since it is of itself sufficient to produce the effect.

   And if the cause manifests an operation sufficient in itself, the
   co-operating cause indicates assistance and service along with the
   other. If, accordingly, it effects nothing, it will not be called even
   a co-operating cause; and if it does effect something, it is wholly the
   cause of this, that is, of what is produced by it. That is, then, a
   co-operating cause, which being present, the effect was produced--the
   visible visibly, and the occult invisibly.

   The Joint-cause belongs also to the genus of causes, as a
   fellow-soldier is a soldier, and as a fellow-youth is a youth.

   The Co-operating cause further aids the Synectic, in the way of
   intensifying what is produced by it. But the Joint-cause does not fall
   under the same notion. For a thing may be a Joint-cause, though it be
   not a Synectic cause. For the Joint-cause is conceived in conjunction
   with another, which is not capable of producing the effect by itself,
   being a cause along with a cause. And the Co-operating cause differs
   from the Joint-cause in this particular, that the Joint-cause produces
   the effect in that which by itself does not act. But the Co-operating
   cause, while effecting nothing by itself, yet by its accession to that
   which acts by itself, co-operates with it, in order to the production
   of the effect in the intensest degree. But especially is that which
   becomes co-operating from being Procatarctic, effective in intensifying
   the force of the cause. [3710]

  Elucidations.

      I.

   (Scripture, cap. i. p. [134]558.)

   On the 18th of July, 1870, Pius the Ninth, by the bull Pastor Æternus
   proclaiming himself infallible, and defining that every Roman bishop
   from the times of the apostles were equally so, placed himself in
   conflict, not merely with Holy Scripture (which repeatedly proves the
   fallibility of St. Peter himself, when speaking apart from his
   fellow-apostles), but with the torrent of all antiquity. Yes, and with
   the great divines of his own communion, such as Bossuet; including
   divers pontiffs, and the Gallicans generally. But note, here, what St.
   Clement says of the Holy Scripture, and of the search after truth. Is
   it conceivable, that he knew of any living infallible oracle, when he
   wrote this book, never once hinting the existence of any such source of
   absolute gnostic perfection? A like ignorance of such an oracle
   characterizes Vincent of Lerins, the great expounder of the rule of
   faith as understood by the four great councils of antiquity.

   Clearly, Clement had never seen in Irenæus the meaning read into his
   words by the modern flatterers of the Roman See. [3711] The discovery
   of 1870 comes just eighteen centuries too late for practical purposes.

      II.

   (Of Book the Eighth, [135]note 1, p. 567.)

   In the place of this book, according to some mss., Photius found the
   tract tis ho sozomenos plousios; in other mss., a book beginning as
   this does. He accused the Stromata of unsound opinions; but, this
   censure not being supported by anything we possess, some imagine that
   the eighth book is lost, and that it is no great loss after all. A rash
   judgment as to its value; but possibly this, which is called the eighth
   book, is from the lost Hypotyposes. Kaye's suggestion is, that, as the
   seventh book closed with a promise of something quite fresh, we may
   discover it in this contribution towards forming his Gnostic, to
   further knowledge.

   It should be regarded as of great importance, that Christianity appears
   as the friend of all knowledge, and of human culture, from the very
   start. To our author's versatile genius, much credit is due for the
   elements out of which Christian universities took their rise.

    I.--From the Latin Translation of Cassiodorus. [3712]

      I.--Comments [3713] On the First Epistle of Peter.

   Chap. i. 3. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   who by His great mercy hath regenerated us." For if God generated us of
   matter, He afterwards, by progress in life, regenerated us.

   "The Father of our Lord, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:" who,
   according to your faith, rises again in us; as, on the other hand, He
   dies in us, through the operation of our unbelief. For He said again,
   that the soul never returns a second time to the body in this life; and
   that which has become angelic does not become unrighteous or evil, so
   as not to have the opportunity of again sinning by the assumption of
   flesh; but that in the resurrection the soul [3714] returns to the
   body, and both are joined to one another according to their peculiar
   nature, adapting themselves, through the composition of each, by a kind
   of congruity like [3715] a building of stones.

   Besides, Peter says, [3716] "Ye also, as living stones, are built up a
   spiritual house;" meaning the place of the angelic abode, guarded in
   heaven [3717] . "For you," he says, "who are kept by the power of God,
   by faith and contemplation, to receive the end of your faith, the
   salvation of your souls."

   Hence it appears that the soul is not naturally immortal; but is made
   immortal by the grace of God, through faith and righteousness, and by
   knowledge. "Of which salvation," he says, [3718] "the prophets have
   inquired and searched diligently," and what follows. It is declared by
   this that the prophets spake with wisdom, and that the Spirit of Christ
   was in them, according to the possession of Christ, and in subjection
   to Christ. For God works through archangels and kindred angels, who are
   called spirits of Christ.

   "Which are now," he says, [3719] "reported unto you by them that have
   preached the Gospel unto you." The old things which were done by the
   prophets and escape the observation of most, are now revealed to you by
   the evangelists. "For to you," he says, [3720] "they are manifested by
   the Holy Ghost, who was sent;" that is the Paraclete, of whom the Lord
   said, "If I go not away, He will not come." [3721] "Unto whom," [3722]
   it is said, "the angels desire to look;" not the apostate angels, as
   most suspect, but, what is a divine truth, angels who desire to obtain
   the advantage of that perfection.

   "By precious blood," he says, [3723] "as of a lamb without blemish and
   without spot." Here he touches on the ancient Levitical and sacerdotal
   celebrations; but means a soul pure through righteousness which is
   offered to God.

   "Verily foreknown before the foundation of the world." [3724] Inasmuch
   as He was foreknown before every creature, because He was Christ. "But
   manifested in the last times" by the generation of a body. "Being born
   again, not of corruptible seed." [3725] The soul, then, which is
   produced along with the body is corruptible, as some think.

   "But the word of the Lord," he says, [3726] "endureth for ever:" as
   well prophecy as divine doctrine.

   "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood." [3727] That we
   are a chosen race by the election of God is abundantly clear. He says
   royal, because we are called to sovereignty and belong to Christ; and
   priesthood on account of the oblation which is made by prayers and
   instructions, by which are gained the souls which are offered to God.

   "Who, when He was reviled," he says, [3728] "reviled not; when He
   suffered, threatened not." The Lord acted so in His goodness and
   patience. "But committed Himself to him that judged Him unrighteously:"
   [3729] whether Himself, so that, regarding Himself in this way, there
   is a transposition. [3730] He indeed gave Himself up to those who
   judged according to an unjust law; because He was unserviceable to
   them, inasmuch as He was righteous: or, He committed to God those who
   judged unrighteously, and without cause insisted on His death, so that
   they might be instructed by suffering punishment.

   "For he that will love life, and see good days;" [3731] that is, who
   wishes to become eternal and immortal. And He calls the Lord life, and
   the days good, that is holy.

   "For the eyes of the Lord," he says, "are upon the righteous, and His
   ears on their prayers:" he means the manifold inspection of the Holy
   Spirit. "The face of the Lord is on them that do evil;" [3732] that is,
   whether judgment, or vengeance, or manifestation.

   "But sanctify the Lord Christ," he says, "in your hearts." [3733] For
   so you have in the Lord's prayer, "Hallowed be Thy name." [3734]

   "For Christ," he says, [3735] "hath once suffered for our sins, the
   just for the unjust, that he might present [3736] us to God; being put
   to death in the flesh, but quickened in the spirit." He says these
   things, reducing them to their faith. That is, He became alive in our
   spirits.

   "Coming," he says, [3737] "He preached to those who were once
   unbelieving." They saw not His form, but they heard His voice.

   "When the long-suffering of God" [3738] holds out. God is so good, as
   to work the result by the teaching of salvation.

   "By the resurrection," it is said, [3739] "of Jesus Christ:" that,
   namely, which is effected in us by faith.

   "Angels being subjected to Him," [3740] which are the first order; and
   "principalities" being subject, who are of the second order; and
   "powers" being also subject, which are said to belong to the third
   order.

   "Who shall give account," he says, [3741] "to Him who is ready to judge
   the quick and the dead."

   These are trained through previous judgments. [3742] Therefore he adds,
   "For this cause was the Gospel preached also to the dead"--to us,
   namely, who were at one time unbelievers. "That they might be judged
   according to men," he says, [3743] "in the flesh, but live according to
   God in the spirit." Because, that is, they have fallen away from faith;
   whilst they are still in the flesh they are judged according to
   preceding judgments, that they might repent. Accordingly, he also adds,
   saying, "That they might live according to God in the spirit." So Paul
   also; for he, too, states something of this nature when he says, "Whom
   I have delivered to Satan, that he might live in the spirit;" [3744]
   that is, "as good stewards of the manifold grace of God." Similarly
   also Paul says, "Variously, and in many ways, God of old spake to our
   fathers." [3745]

   "Rejoice," it is said, [3746] "that ye are partakers in the sufferings
   of Christ:" that is, if ye are righteous, ye suffer for righteousness'
   sake, as Christ suffered for righteousness. "Happy are ye, for the
   Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of His glory and virtue, resteth on
   you." This possessive "His" signifies also an an angelic spirit:
   inasmuch as the glory of God those are, through whom, according to
   faith and righteousness, He is glorified, to honourable glory,
   according to the advancement of the saints who are brought in. "The
   Spirit of God on us," may be thus understood; that is, who through
   faith comes on the soul, like a gracefulness of mind and beauty of
   soul.

   "Since," it is said, [3747] "it is time for judgment beginning at the
   house of God." For judgment will overtake these in the appointed
   persecutions.

   "But the God of all grace," he says. [3748] "Of all grace," he says,
   because He is good, and the giver of all good things.

   "Marcus, my son, saluteth you." [3749] Mark, the follower of Peter,
   while Peter publicly preached the Gospel at Rome before some of Cæsar's
   equites, and adduced many testimonies to Christ, in order that thereby
   they might be able to commit to memory what was spoken, of what was
   spoken by Peter, wrote entirely what is called the Gospel according to
   Mark. As Luke also may be recognised [3750] by the style, both to have
   composed the Acts of the Apostles, and to have translated Paul's
   Epistle to the Hebrews.

      II.--Comments on the Epistle of Jude.

   Jude, who wrote the Catholic Epistle, the brother of the sons of
   Joseph, and very religious, whilst knowing the near relationship of the
   Lord, yet did not say that he himself was His brother. But what said
   he? [3751] "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ,"--of Him as Lord; but "the
   brother of James." For this is true; he was His brother, (the son)
   [3752] of Joseph. "For [3753] certain men have entered unawares,
   ungodly men, who had been of old ordained and predestined to the
   judgment of our God;" not that they might become impious, but that,
   being now impious, they were ordained to judgment. "For the Lord God,"
   he says, [3754] "who once delivered a people out of Egypt, afterward
   destroyed them that believed not;" that is, that He might train them
   through punishment. For they were indeed punished, and they perished on
   account of those that are saved, until they turn to the Lord. "But the
   angels," he says, [3755] "that kept not their own pre-eminence," that,
   namely, which they received through advancement, "but left their own
   habitation," meaning, that is, the heaven and the stars, became, and
   are called apostates. "He hath reserved these to the judgment of the
   great day, in chains, under darkness." He means the place near the
   earth, [3756] that is, the dark air. Now he called "chains" the loss of
   the honour in which they had stood, and the lust of feeble things;
   since, bound by their own lust, they cannot be converted. "As Sodom and
   Gomorrha," he says. [3757] ... By which the Lord signifies that pardon
   had been granted; [3758] and that on being disciplined they had
   repented. "Similarly [3759] to the same," he says, [3760] "also those
   dreamers,"--that is, who dream in their imagination lusts and wicked
   desires, regarding as good not that which is truly good, and superior
   to all good,--"defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of
   majesty," that is, the only Lord, [3761] who is truly our Lord, Jesus
   Christ, and alone worthy of praise. They "speak evil of majesty," that
   is, of the angels.

   "When Michael, the archangel, [3762] disputing with the devil, debated
   about the body of Moses." Here he confirms the assumption of Moses. He
   is here called Michael, who through an angel near to us debated with
   the devil.

   "But these," he says, [3763] "speak evil of those things which they
   know not; but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in these
   things they corrupt themselves." He means that they eat, and drink, and
   indulge in uncleanness, and says that they do other things that are
   common to them with animals, devoid of reason.

   "Woe unto them!" he says, [3764] "for they have gone in the way of
   Cain." For so also we lie under Adam's sin through similarity of sin.
   "Clouds," he says, [3765] "without water; who do not possess in
   themselves the divine and fruitful word." Wherefore, he says, "men of
   this kind are carried about both by winds and violent blasts." [3766]
   "Trees," he says, "of autumn, without fruit,"--unbelievers, that is,
   who bear no fruit of fidelity. "Twice dead," he says: once, namely,
   when they sinned by transgressing, and a second time when delivered up
   to punishment, according to the predestined judgments of God; inasmuch
   as it is to be reckoned death, even when each one does not forthwith
   deserve the inheritance. "Waves," he says, [3767] "of a raging sea." By
   these words he signifies the life of the Gentiles, whose end is
   abominable ambition. [3768] "Wandering stars,"--that is, he means those
   who err and are apostates are of that kind of stars which fell from the
   seats of the angels--"to whom," for their apostasy, "the blackness of
   darkness is reserved for ever. Enoch also, the seventh from Adam," he
   says, [3769] "prophesied of these." In these words he verities the
   prophecy.

   "Those," he says, [3770] "separating" the faithful from the unfaithful,
   be convicted according to their own unbelief. And again those
   separating from the flesh. [3771] He says, "Animal [3772] not having
   the spirit;" that is, the spirit which is by faith, which supervenes
   through the practice of righteousness.

   "But ye, beloved," he says, [3773] "building up yourselves on your most
   holy faith, in the Holy Spirit." "But some," he says, [3774] "save,
   plucking them from the fire;" [3775] "but of some have compassion in
   fear," that is, teach those who fall into the fire to free themselves.
   "Hating," he says, [3776] "that spotted garment, which is carnal:" that
   of the soul, namely; the spotted garment is a spirit polluternal lusts.
   [3777]

   "Now to Him," he says, [3778] "who is able to keep you without
   stumbling, and present you faultless before the presence of His glory
   in joy." In the presence of His glory: he means in the presence of the
   angels, to be presented faultless, having become angels. [3779] When
   Daniel speaks of the people and comes into the presence of the Lord, he
   does not say this, because he saw God: for it is impossible that any
   one whose heart is not pure should see God; but he says this, that
   everything that the people did was in the sight of God, and was
   manifest to Him; that is, that nothing is hid from the Lord.

   Now, in the Gospel according to Mark, the Lord being interrogated by
   the chief of the priests if He was the Christ, the Son of the blessed
   God, answering, said, "I am; [3780] and ye shall see the Son of man
   sitting at the right hand of power." [3781] But powers [3782] mean the
   holy angels. Further, when He says "at the right hand of God," He means
   the self-same [beings], by reason of the equality and likeness of the
   angelic and holy powers, which are called by the name of God. He says,
   therefore, that He sits at the right hand; that is, that He rests in
   pre-eminent honour. In the other Gospels, however, He is said not to
   have replied to the high priest, on his asking if He was the Son of
   God. But what said He? "You say." [3783] Answering sufficiently well.
   For had He said, It is as you understand, he would have said what was
   not true, not confessing Himself to be the Son of God; [for] they did
   not entertain this opinion of Him; but by saying "You say," [3784] He
   spake truly. For what they had no knowledge of, but expressed in words,
   that he confessed to be true.

      III.--Comments on the First Epistle of John.

   Chap. i. 1. "That which was from the beginning; which we have seen with
   our eyes; which we have heard."

   Following the Gospel according to John, and in accordance with it, this
   Epistle also contains the spiritual principle.

   What therefore he says, "from the beginning," the Presbyter explained
   to this effect, that the beginning of generation is not separated from
   the beginning of the Creator. For when he says, "That which was from
   the beginning," he touches upon the generation without beginning of the
   Son, who is co-existent with the Father. There was; then, a Word
   importing an unbeginning eternity; as also the Word itself, that is,
   the Son of God, who being, by equality of substance, one with the
   Father, is eternal and uncreate. That He was always the Word, is
   signified by saying, "In the beginning was the Word." But by the
   expression, "we have seen with our eyes," he signifies the Lord's
   presence in the flesh, "and our hands have handled," he says, "of the
   Word of life." He means not only His flesh, but the virtues of the Son,
   like the sunbeam which penetrates to the lowest places,--this sunbeam
   coming in the flesh became palpable to the disciples. It is accordingly
   related in traditions, that John, touching the outward body itself,
   sent his hand deep down into it, and that the solidity of the flesh
   offered no obstacle, but gave way to the hand of the disciple.

   "And our hands have handled of the Word of life;" that is, He who came
   in the flesh became capable of being touched. As also,

   Ver. 2. "The life was manifested." For in the Gospel he thus speaks:
   "And what was made, in Him was life, and the life was the light of
   men." [3785]

   "And we show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and
   was manifested unto you."

   He signifies by the appellation of Father, that the Son also existed
   always, without beginning.

   Ver. 5. "For God," he says, "is light."

   He does not express the divine essence, but wishing to declare the
   majesty of God, he has applied to the Divinity what is best and most
   excellent in the view of men. Thus also Paul, when he speaks of "light
   inaccessible." [3786] But John himself also in this same Epistle says,
   "God is love:" [3787] pointing out the excellences of God, that He is
   kind and merciful; and because He is light, makes men righteous,
   according to the advancement of the soul, through charity. God, then,
   who is ineffable in respect of His substance, is light.

   "And in Him is no darkness at all,"--that is, no passion, no keeping up
   of evil respecting any one, [He] destroys no one, but gives salvation
   to all. Light moreover signifies, either the precepts of the Law, or
   faith, or doctrine. Darkness is the opposite of these things. Not as if
   there were another way; since there is only one way according to the
   divine precepts. For the work of God is unity. Duality and all else
   that exists, except unity, arises from perversity of life.

   Ver. 7. "And the blood of Jesus Christ His Son," he says, "cleanses
   us." For the doctrine of the Lord, which is very powerful, is called
   His blood.

   Ver. 10. "If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and
   His word is not in us." His doctrine, that is, or word is truth.

   Chap. ii. 1. "And if any man sin," he says, "we have an advocate [3788]
   with the Father, Jesus Christ." For so the Lord is an advocate with the
   Father for us. So also is there, an advocate, whom, after His
   assumption, He vouchsafed to send. For these primitive and
   first-created virtues are unchangeable as to substance, and along with
   subordinate angels and archangels, whose names they share, effect
   divine operations. Thus also Moses names the virtue of the angel
   Michael, by an angel near to himself and of lowest grade. The like also
   we find in the holy prophets; but to Moses an angel appeared near and
   at hand. Moses heard him and spoke to him manifestly, face to face. On
   the other prophets, through the agency of angels, an impression was
   made, as of beings hearing and seeing.

   On this account also, they alone heard, and they alone saw; as also is
   seen in the case of Samuel. [3789] Elisæus also alone heard the voice
   by which he was called. [3790] If the voice had been open and common,
   it would have been heard by all. In this instance it was heard by him
   alone in whom the impression made by the angel worked.

   Ver. 2. "And not only for our sins,"--that is for those of the
   faithful,--is the Lord the propitiator, does he say, "but also for the
   whole world." He, indeed, saves all; but some [He saves], converting
   them by punishments; others, however, who follow voluntarily [He saves]
   with dignity of honour; so "that every knee should bow to Him, of
   things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth;"
   [3791] that is, angels, men, and souls that before His advent have
   departed from this temporal life.

   Ver. 3. "And by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His
   commandments." For the Gnostic [3792] [he who knows] also does the
   Works which pertain to the province of virtue. But he who performs the
   works is not necessarily also a Gnostic. For a man may be a doer of
   right works, and yet not a knower of the mysteries of science. Finally,
   knowing that some works are performed from fear of punishment, and some
   on account of the promise of reward, he shows the perfection of the man
   gifted with knowledge, who fulfils his works by love. Further, he adds,
   and says:--

   Ver. 5. "But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God
   perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him,"--by faith and love.

   Ver. 7. "I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment,
   which ye had from the beginning,"--through the Law, that is, and the
   prophets; where it is said, God is one. Accordingly, also, he infers,
   "For the old commandment is the word which ye have heard."

   Again, however, he says:--

   Ver. 8. "This is the commandment; for the darkness" of perversion, that
   is, "has passed away, and, lo, the true light hath already
   shone,"--that is, through faith, through knowledge, through the
   Covenant working in men, through prepared judgments.

   Ver. 9. "He that saith he is in the light,"--in the light, he means in
   the truth,--"and hateth," he says, "his brother." By his brother, he
   means not only his neighbour, but also the Lord. For unbelievers hate
   Him and do not keep His commandments. Therefore also he infers:--

   Ver. 10. "He that loveth his brother abideth in the light; and there is
   none occasion of stumbling in him."

   Vers. 12-14. He then indicates the stages of advancement and progress
   of souls that are still located in the flesh; and calls those whose
   sins have been forgiven, for the Lord's name's sake, "little children,"
   for many believe on account of the name only. He styles "fathers" the
   perfect, "who have known what was from the beginning," and received
   with understanding,--the Son, that is, of whom he said above, "that
   which was from the beginning."

   "I write," says he, "to you, young men, because ye have overcome the
   wicked one." Young man strong in despising pleasures. "The wicked one"
   points out the eminence of the devil. "The children," moreover, know
   the Father; having fled from idols and gathered together to the one
   God.

   Ver. 15. "For the world," he says, "is in the wicked one." Is not the
   world, and all that is in the world, called God's creation and very
   good? Yes. But,

   Ver. 16. "The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the ambition
   of the world," which arise from the perversion of life, "are not of the
   Father, but of the world," and of you.

   Ver. 17. "Therefore also the world shall pass away, and the lust
   thereof; but he that doeth the will of God" and His commandments
   "abideth for ever."

   Ver. 19. "They went out from us; but they were not of us"--neither the
   apostate angels, nor men falling away;--"but that they may be
   manifested that they are not of us." With sufficient clearness he
   distinguishes the class of the elect and that of the lost, and that
   which remaining in faith "has an unction from the Holy One," which
   comes through faith. He that abideth not in faith.

   Ver. 22. "A liar" and "an antichrist, who denieth that Jesus is the
   Christ." For Jesus, Saviour and Redeemer, is also Christ the King.

   Ver. 23. "He who denies the Son," by ignoring Him, "has not the Father,
   nor does he know Him." But he who knoweth the Son and the Father, knows
   according to knowledge, and when the Lord shall be manifested at His
   second advent, shall have confidence and not be confounded. Which
   confusion is heavy punishment.

   Ver. 29. "Every one," he says, "who doeth righteousness is born of
   God;" being regenerated, that is, according to faith.

   Chap. iii. 1. "For the world knoweth us not, as it knew Him not." He
   means by the world those who live a worldly life in pleasures.

   Ver. 2. "Beloved," says he, "now are we the sons of God," not by
   natural affection, but because we have God as our Father. For it is the
   greater love that, seeing we have no relationship to God, He
   nevertheless loves us and calls us His sons. "And it hath not yet
   appeared what we shall be;" that is, to what kind of glory we shall
   attain. "For if He shall be manifested,"--that is, if we are made
   perfect,--"we shall be like Him," as reposing and justified, pure in
   virtue, "so that we may see Him" (His countenance) "as He is," by
   comprehension.

   Ver. 8. "He that doeth unrighteousness is of the devil," that is, of
   the devil as his father, following and choosing the same things. "The
   devil sinneth from the beginning," he says. From the beginning from
   which he began to sin, incorrigibly persevering in sinning.

   Ver. 9. He says, "Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin, for His
   seed remaineth in him;" that is, His word in him who is born again
   through faith.

   Ver. 10. "Thus we know the children of God, as likewise the children of
   the devil," who choose things like the devil; for so also they are said
   to be of the wicked one.

   Ver. 15. "Every one who hateth his brother is a murderer." For in him
   through unbelief Christ dies. Rightly, therefore, he continues, "And ye
   know that no murderer and unbeliever hath eternal life abiding in him."
   For the living Christ [3793] abides in the believing soul.

   Ver. 16. "For He Himself laid down His life for us;" that is, for those
   who believe; that is, for the apostles. If then He laid down His life
   for the apostles, he means His apostles themselves: us if he said, We,
   I say, the apostles, for whom He laid down His life, "ought to lay down
   our lives for the brethren;" for the salvation of their neighbours was
   the glory of the apostles.

   Ver. 20. He says, "For God is greater than our heart;" that is, the
   virtue of God [is greater] than conscience, which will follow the soul.
   Wherefore he continues, and says, "and knoweth all things."

   Ver. 21. "Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, it will have confidence
   before God."

   Ver. 24. "And hereby we know that He dwelleth in us by His Spirit,
   which He hath given us;" that is, by superintendence and foresight of
   future events.

   Chap. iv. 18. He says, "Perfect love casteth out fear." For the
   perfection of a believing man is love.

   Chap. v. 6. He says, "This is He who came by water and blood;" and
   again,--

   Ver. 8. "For there are three that bear witness, the spirit," which is
   life, "and the water," which is regeneration and faith, "and the
   blood," which is knowledge; "and these three are one." For in the
   Saviour are those saving virtues, and life itself exists in His own
   Son.

   Ver. 14. "And this is the confidence which we have towards Him, that if
   we ask anything according to His will, He will hear us." He does not
   say absolutely what we shall ask, but what we ought to ask.

   Ver. 19. "And the whole word lieth in the wicked one;" not the
   creation, but worldly men, and those who live according to their lusts.

   Ver. 20. "And the Son of God hath come and given us understanding,"
   which comes to us, that is, by faith, and is also called the Holy
   Spirit.

      IV.--Comments on the Second Epistle of John.

   The second Epistle of John, which is written to Virgins, is very
   simple. It was written to a Babylonian lady, by name Electa, and
   indicates the election of the holy Church. He establishes in this
   Epistle that the following out of the faith is not without charity, and
   so that no one divide Jesus Christ; but only to believe that Jesus
   Christ has come in the flesh. For he who has the Son by apprehension in
   his intellect knows also the Father, and grasps with his mind
   intelligibly the greatness of His power working without beginning of
   time.

   Ver. 10. He says, "If any come unto you and bring not this doctrine,
   receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed; for he that
   biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds." He forbids us to
   salute such, and to receive them to our hospitality. For this is not
   harsh in the case of a man of this sort. But he admonishes them neither
   to confer nor dispute with such as are not able to handle divine things
   with intelligence, lest through them they be seduced from the doctrine
   of truth, influenced by plausible reasons. Now, I think that we are not
   even to pray with such, because in the prayer which is made at home,
   after rising from prayer, the salutation of joy is also the token of
   peace.

    II.--Nicetas [3794] Bishop of Heraclea.

      From His Catena.

      I.--Job i. 21.

   But Job's words may be more elegantly understood of evil and sin thus:
   "Naked" was formed from the earth at the beginning, as if from a
   "mother's womb: naked to the earth shall I also depart;" naked, [3795]
   not of possessions, for that were a trivial and common thing, but of
   evil and sin, and of the unsightly shape which follows those who have
   led bad lives. Obviously, all of us human beings are born naked, and
   again are buried naked, swathed only in grave-clothes. For God hath
   provided for us another life, and made the present life the way for the
   course which leads to it; appointing the supplies derived from what we
   possess merely as provisions for the way; and on our quitting this way,
   the wealth, consisting of the things which we possessed, journeys no
   farther with us. For not a single thing that we possess is properly our
   own: of one possession alone, that is godliness, are we properly
   owners. Of this, death, when it overtakes us, will not rob us; but from
   all else it will eject us, though against our will. For it is for the
   support of life that we all have received what we possess; and after
   enjoying merely the use of it, each one departs, obtaining from life a
   brief remembrance. For this is the end of all prosperity; this is the
   conclusion of the good things of this life. Well, then, does the
   infant, on opening its eyes, after issuing from the womb, immediately
   begin with crying, not with laughter. For it weeps, as if bewailing
   life, at whose hands from the outset it tastes of deadly gifts. For
   immediately on being born its hands and feet are swaddled; and swathed
   in bonds it takes the breast. O introduction to life, precursor of
   death! The child has but just entered on life, and straightway there is
   put upon it the raiment of the dead: for nature reminds those that are
   born of their end. Wherefore also the child, on being born, wails, as
   if crying plaintively to its mother. Why, O mother, didst thou bring me
   forth to this life, in which prolongation of life is progress to death?
   Why hast thou brought me into this troubled world, in which, on being
   born, swaddling bands are my first experience? Why hast thou delivered
   me to such a life as this, in which both a pitiable youth wastes away
   before old age, and old age is shunned as under the doom of death?
   Dreadful, O mother, is the course of life, which has death as the goal
   of the runner. Bitter is the road of life we travel, with the grave as
   the wayfarer's inn. Perilous the sea of life we sail; for it has Hades
   as a pirate to attack us. Man alone is born in all respects naked,
   without a weapon or clothing born with him; not as being inferior to
   the other animals, but that nakedness and your bringing nothing with
   you may produce thought; and that thought may bring out dexterity,
   expel sloth, introduce the arts for the supply of our needs, and beget
   variety of contrivances. For, naked, man is full of contrivances, being
   pricked on by his necessity, as by a goad, how to escape rains, how to
   elude cold, how to fence off blows, how to till the earth, how to
   terrify wild beasts, how to subdue the more powerful of them. Wetted
   with rain, he contrived a roof; having suffered from cold, he invented
   clothing; being struck, he constructed a breastplate; bleeding his
   hands with the thorns in tilling the ground, he availed himself of the
   help of tools; in his naked state liable to become a prey to wild
   beasts, he discovered from his fear an art which frightened what
   frightened him. Nakedness begat one accomplishment after another; so
   that even his nakedness was a gift and a master-favour. Accordingly,
   Job also being made naked of wealth, possessions, of the blessing of
   children, of a numerous offspring, and having lost everything in a
   short time, uttered this grateful exclamation: "Naked came I out of the
   womb, naked also shall I depart thither;"--to God, that is, and to that
   blessed lot and rest.

      II.--From the Same.

   Job v. 7. Calmness is a thing which, of all other things, is most to be
   prized. As an example of this, the word proposes to us the blessed Job.
   For it is said of him, "What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning
   like water?" For truly enviable, and, in my judgment, worthy of all
   admiration, a man is, if he has attained to such a degree of
   long-suffering as to be able with ease to grapple with the pain, truly
   keen, and not easily conquered by everybody, which arises from being
   wronged.

      III.--From Nicetas' Catena on Matthew.

   Matt. v. 42. Alms are to be given, but with judgment, and to the
   deserving, that we may obtain a recompense from the Most High. But woe
   to those who have and who take under false pretences, or who are able
   to help themselves and want to take from others. For he who has, and,
   to carry out false pretences or out of laziness, takes, shall be
   condemned.

      IV.--From the Same.

   Matt. xiii. 31. The word which proclaims the kingdom of heaven is sharp
   and pungent as mustard, and represses bile, that is, anger, and checks
   inflammation, that is, pride; and from this word the soul's true health
   and eternal soundness [3796] flow. To such increased size did the
   growth of the word come, that the tree which sprang from it (that is
   the Church of Christ established over the whole earth) filled the
   world, so that the fowls of the air--that is, divine angels and lofty
   souls--dwelt in its branches.

      V.--From the Same.

   Matt. xiii. 46. A pearl, and that pellucid and of purest ray, is Jesus,
   whom of the lightning flash of Divinity the Virgin bore. For as the
   pearl, produced in flesh and the oyster-shell and moisture, appears to
   be a body moist and transparent, full of light and spirit; so also God
   the Word, incarnate, is intellectual light, [3797] sending His rays,
   through a body luminous and moist.

      III.--From the Catena on Luke, Edited by Corderius.

   Luke iii. 22. God here assumed the "likeness" not of a man, but "of a
   dove," because He wished, by a new apparition of the Spirit in the
   likeness of a dove, to declare His simplicity and majesty.

   Luke xvi. 17. Perhaps by the iota and tittle His righteousness cries,
   "If ye come right unto Me, I will also come right to you; but if
   crooked, I also will come crooked, saith the Lord of hosts;" intimating
   that the ways of sinners are intricate and crooked. For the way right
   and agreeable to nature which is intimated by the iota of Jesus, is His
   goodness, which constantly directs those who believe from hearing.
   "There shall not, therefore, pass from the law one iota or one tittle,"
   neither from the right and good the mutual promises, nor from the
   crooked and unjust the punishment assigned to them. "For the Lord doeth
   good to the good, but those who turn aside into crooked ways God will
   lead with the workers of iniquity." [3798]

      IV.--From the Books of the Hypotyposes.

      OEcumenius from Book III. On 1 Cor. xi. 10.

   "Because of the angels." By the angels he means righteous and virtuous
   men. Let her be veiled then, that she may not lead them to stumble into
   fornication. For the real angels in heaven see her though veiled.

      The Same, Book IV. On 2 Cor. v. 16.

   "And if we have known Christ after the flesh." As "after the flesh" in
   our case is being in the midst of sins, and being out of them is "not
   after the flesh;" so also "after the flesh" in the case of Christ was
   His subjection to natural affections, and His not being subject to them
   is to be "not after the flesh." But, he says, as He was released, so
   also are we.

      The Same, Book IV. On 2 Cor. vi. 11.

   "Our heart is enlarged," to teach you all things. But ye are straitened
   in your own bowels, that is, in love to God, in which ye ought to love
   me.

      The Same, Book V. On Gal. v. 24.

   "And they that are Christ's [have crucified] the flesh." And why
   mention one aspect of virtue after another? For there are some who have
   crucified themselves as far as the passions are concerned, and the
   passions as far as respects themselves. According to this
   interpretation the "and" is not superfluous. "And they that are
   Christ's"--that is, striving after Him--"have crucified their own
   flesh."

      Moschus: Spiritual Meadow, Book V. Chap. 176.

   Yes, truly, the apostles were baptised, as Clement the Stromatist
   relates in the fifth book of the Hypotyposes. For, in explaining the
   apostolic statement, "I thank God that I baptised none of you," he
   says, Christ is said to have baptised Peter alone, and Peter Andrew,
   and Andrew John, and they James and the rest. [3799]

      Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, Book VI. II. 1.

   Now Clement, writing in the sixth book of the Hypotyposes, makes this
   statement. For he says that Peter and James and John, after the
   Saviour's ascension, though pre-eminently honoured by the Lord, did not
   contend for glory, but made James the Just, bishop of Jerusalem.

      Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, II. 15.

   So, then, through the visit of the divine word to them, the power of
   Simon was extinguished, and immediately was destroyed along with the
   man himself. And such a ray of godliness shone forth on the minds of
   Peter's hearers, that they were not satisfied with the once hearing or
   with the unwritten teaching of the divine proclamation, but with all
   manner of entreaties importuned Mark, to whom the Gospel is ascribed,
   he being the companion of Peter, that he would leave in writing a
   record of the teaching which had been delivered to them verbally; and
   did not let the man alone till they prevailed upon him; and so to them
   we owe the Scripture called the "Gospel by Mark." On learning what had
   been done, through the revelation of the Spirit, it is said that the
   apostle was delighted with the enthusiasm of the men, and sanctioned
   the composition for reading in the Churches. Clemens gives the
   narrative in the sixth book of the Hypotyposes.

      Eusebius: Ibid.

   Then, also, as the divine Scripture says, Herod, on the execution of
   James, seeing that what was done pleased the Jews, laid hands also on
   Peter; and having put him in chains, would have presently put him to
   death, had not an angel in a divine vision appeared to him by night,
   and wondrously releasing him from his bonds, sent him away to the
   ministry of preaching.

      Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, VI. 14.

   And in the Hypotyposes, in a word, he has made abbreviated narratives
   of the whole testamentary Scripture; and has not passed over the
   disputed books,--I mean Jude and the rest of the Catholic Epistles and
   Barnabas, and what is called the Revelation of Peter. And he says that
   the Epistle to the Hebrews is Paul's, and was written to the Hebrews in
   the Hebrew language; but that Luke, having carefully translated it,
   gave it to the Greeks, and hence the same colouring in the expression
   is discoverable in this Epistle and the Acts; and that the name "Paul
   an Apostle" was very properly not prefixed, for, he says, that writing
   to the Hebrews, who were prejudiced against him and suspected, he with
   great wisdom did not repel them in the beginning by putting down his
   name.

      Eusebius: Book VII.

   1 Tim. ii. 6. "In his times;" that is, when men were in a condition of
   fitness for faith.

   1 Tim. iii. 16. "Was seen of angels." O mystery! The angels saw Christ
   while He was with us, not having seen Him before. Not as by men.

   1 Tim. v. 8. "And especially those of his own house." He provides for
   his own and those of his own house, who not only provides for his
   relatives, but also for himself, by extirpating the passions.

   1 Tim. v. 10. "If she have washed the feet of saints;" that is, if she
   has performed without shame the meanest offices for the saints.

   1 Tim. v. 21. "Without prejudice;" [3800] that is, without falling
   under the doom and punishment of disobedience through making any false
   step.

   1 Tim. vi. 13. "Who witnessed before Pontius Pilate." For He testified
   by what he did that He was Christ the Son of God.

   2 Tim. ii. 2. "By many witnesses;" [3801] that is, the law and the
   prophets. For these the apostle made witnesses of his own preaching.

      Eusebius: Ecclesiastical History, Book. VII. II. 1.

   To James the Just, and John and Peter, the Lord after His resurrection
   imparted knowledge (ten gnosin.) These imparted it to the rest of the
   apostles, and the rest of the apostles to the Seventy, of whom Barnabas
   was one.

      Eusebius: the Same, II. 2.

   And of this James, Clement also relates an anecdote worthy of
   remembrance in the seventh book of the Hypotyposes, from a tradition of
   his predecessors. He says that the man who brought him to trial, on
   seeing him bear his testimony, was moved, and confessed that he was a
   Christian himself. Accordingly, he says, they were both led away
   together, and on the way the other asked James to forgive him. And he,
   considering a little, said, "Peace be to thee" and kissed him. And so
   both were beheaded together.

      Eusebius: the Same, VI. 14.

   And now, as the blessed Presbyter used to say, since the Lord, as the
   Apostle of the Almighty, was sent to the Hebrews, Paul, as having been
   sent to the Gentiles, did not subscribe himself apostle of the Hebrews,
   out of modesty and reverence for the Lord, and because, being the
   herald and apostle of the Gentiles, his writing to the Hebrews was
   something over and above [his assigned function.]

      Eusebius: the Same.

   Again, in the same books Clement has set down a tradition which he had
   received from the elders before him, in regard to the order of the
   Gospels, to the following effect. He says that the Gospels containing
   the genealogies were written first, and that the Gospel according to
   Mark was composed in the following circumstances:--

   Peter having preached the word publicly at Rome, and by the Spirit
   proclaimed the Gospel, those who were present, who were numerous,
   entreated Mark, inasmuch as he had attended him from an early period,
   and remembered what had been said, to write down what had been spoken.
   On his composing the Gospel, he handed it to those who had made the
   request to him; which coming to Peter's knowledge, he neither hindered
   nor encouraged. But John, the last of all, seeing that what was
   corporeal was set forth in the Gospels, on the entreaty of his intimate
   friends, and inspired by the Spirit, composed a spiritual Gospel.

      V.--From the Book on Providence.

      S. Maximus, Vol. II. 114.

   Being is in God. God is divine being, eternal and without beginning,
   incorporeal and illimitable, and the cause of what exists. Being is
   that which wholly subsists. Nature is the truth of things, or the inner
   reality of them. According to others, it is the production of what has
   come to existence; and according to others, again, it is the providence
   of God, causing the being, and the manner of being, in the things which
   are produced.

      S. Maximus: in the Same, p. 152.

   Willing is a natural power, which desires what is in accordance with
   nature. Willing is a natural appetency, corresponding with the nature
   of the rational creature. Willing is a natural spontaneous movement of
   the self-determining mind, or the mind voluntarily moved about
   anything. Spontaneity is the mind moved naturally, or an intellectual
   self-determining movement of the soul.

      VI.--From the Book on the Soul.

      Maximus and Antonius Melissa. [3802]

   Souls that breathe free of all things, possess life, and though
   separated from the body, and found possessed of a longing for it, are
   borne immortal to the bosom of God: as in the winter season the vapours
   of the earth attracted by the sun's rays rise to him.

      The Barocc. ms. [3803]

   All souls are immortal, even those of the wicked, for whom it were
   better that they were not deathless. For, punished with the endless
   vengeance of quenchless fire, and not dying, it is impossible for them
   to have a period put to their misery.

      VII.--Fragment from the Book on Slander.

      Antonius Melissa, Book. II. Sermon 69. [3804]

   Never be afraid of the slanderer who addresses you. But rather say,
   Stop, brother; I daily commit more grievous errors, and how can I judge
   him? For you will gain two things, healing with one plaster both
   yourself and your neighbour. He shows what is really evil. Whence, by
   these arguments, God has contrived to make each one's disposition
   manifest.

      Antonius Melissa, Book I. Sermon 64, and Book II. Sermon 87. Also Maximus,
      Sermon 59, p. 669; John of Damascus, Book II.

   It is not abstaining from deeds that justifies the believer, but purity
   and sincerity of thoughts.

      VIII.--Other Fragments from Antonius Melissa.

      I.--Book I. Sermon 17, on Confession.

   Repentance then becomes capable of wiping out every sin, when on the
   occurrence of the soul's fault it admits no delay, and does not let the
   impulse pass on to a long space of time. For it is in this way that
   evil will be unable to leave a trace in us, being plucked away at the
   moment of its assault like a newly planted plant.

   As the creatures called crabs are easy to catch, from their going
   sometimes forward and sometimes backward; so also the soul, which at
   one time is laughing, at another weeping, and at another giving way to
   luxury, can do no good.

   He who is sometimes grieving, and is sometimes enjoying himself and
   laughing, is like a man pelting the dog of voluptuousness with bread,
   who chases it in appearance, but in fact invites it to remain near him.

      2. Book I. Sermon 51, on Praise.

   Some flatterers were congratulating a wise man. He said to them, If you
   stop praising me, I think myself something great after your departure;
   but if you do not stop praising me, I guess my own impurity.

   Feigned praise is worth less than true censure.

      3. Book II. Sermon 46, on the Lazy and Indolent.

   To the weak and infirm, what is moderate appears excessive.

      4. Book II. Sermon 55, on Your Neighbour--That You are to Bear His
      Burdens, Etc.

   The reproof that is given with knowledge is very faithful. Sometimes
   also the knowledge of those who are condemned is found to be the most
   perfect demonstration.

      5. Book II. Sermon 74, on the Proud, and Those Desirous of Vainglory.

   To the man who exalts and magnifies himself is attached the quick
   transition and the fall to low estate, as the divine word teaches.

      6. Book II. Sermon 87.

   Pure speech and a spotless life are the throne and true temple of God.

      IX.--Fragment of the Treatise on Marriage.

      Maximus, Sermon III. p. 538, on Modesty and Chastity. Also, John of
      Damascus, Book III.--Parallel Chap. 27.

   It is not only fornication, but also the giving in marriage
   prematurely, that is called fornication; when, so to speak, one not of
   ripe age is given to a husband, either of her own accord or by her
   parents.

      X.--Fragments of Other Lost Books.

      Maximus, Sermon 2.--John of Damascus, II. Chap. 70.--Antonius Melissa,
      Book I. Sermon 52.

   Flattery is the bane of friendship. Most men are accustomed to pay
   court to the good fortune of princes, rather than to the princes
   themselves.

      Maximus, Sermon 13, p. 574.--Antonius Melissa, Sermon 32, p. 45, and
      Sermon 33, p. 57.

   The lovers of frugality shun luxury as the bane of soul and body. The
   possession and use of necessaries has nothing injurious in quality, but
   it has in quantity above measure. Scarcity of food is a necessary
   benefit.

      Maximus, Sermon 52, p. 654.--Antonius Melissa, Book I. Sermon 54.

   The vivid remembrance of death is a check upon diet; and when the diet
   is lessened, the passions are diminished along with it.

      Maximus, Sermon 55, p. 661.

   Above all, Christians are not allowed to correct with violence the
   delinquencies of sins. For it is not those that abstain from wickedness
   from compulsion, but those that abstain from choice, that God crowns.
   It is impossible for a man to be steadily good except by his own
   choice. For he that is made good by compulsion of another is not good;
   for he is not what he is by his own choice. For it is the freedom of
   each one that makes true goodness and reveals real wickedness. Whence
   through these dispositions God contrived to make His own disposition
   manifest.

      XI.--Fragments Found in Greek Only in the Oxford Edition.

      From the Last Work on the Passover. (Quoted in the Paschal Chronicle.)

   Accordingly, in the years gone by, Jesus went to eat the passover
   sacrificed by the Jews, keeping the feast. But when he had preached He
   who was the Passover, the Lamb of God, led as a sheep to the slaughter,
   presently taught His disciples the mystery of the type on the
   thirteenth day, on which also they inquired, "Where wilt Thou that we
   prepare for Thee to eat the passover?" [3805] It was on this day, then,
   that both the consecration of the unleavened bread and the preparation
   for the feast took place. Whence John naturally describes the disciples
   as already previously prepared to have their feet washed by the Lord.
   And on the following day our Saviour suffered, He who was the Passover,
   propitiously sacrificed by the Jews.

      The Same.

   Suitably, therefore, to the fourteenth day, on which He also suffered,
   in the morning, the chief priests and the scribes, who brought Him to
   Pilate, did not enter the Prætorium, that they might not be defiled,
   but might freely eat the passover in the evening. With this precise
   determination of the days both the whole Scriptures agree, and the
   Gospels harmonize. The resurrection also attests it. He certainly rose
   on the third day, which fell on the first day of the weeks of harvest,
   on which the law prescribed that the priest should offer up the sheaf.

      Macarius Chrysocephalus: Parable of the Prodigal Son, Luke xv., Oration on
      Luke xv., Towards the Close.

   1. What choral dance and high festival is held in heaven, if there is
   one that has become an exile and a fugitive from the life led under the
   Father, knowing not that those who put themselves far from Him shall
   perish; if he has squandered the gift, and substance, and inheritance
   of the Father; if there is one whose faith has failed, and whose hope
   is spent, by rushing along with the Gentiles into the same profligacy
   of debauchery; and then, famished and destitute, and not even filled
   with what the swine eat, has arisen and come to his Father!

   But the kind Father waits not till the son comes to Him. For perchance
   he would never be able or venture to approach, did he not find Him
   gracious. Wherefore, when he merely wishing, when he straightway made a
   beginning, when he took the first step, while he was yet a great way
   off, He [the Father] was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell upon
   his neck and kissed him. And then the son, taking courage, confessed
   what he had done.

   Wherefore the Father bestows on him the glory and honour that was due
   and meet, putting on him the best robe, the robe of immortality; and a
   ring, a royal signet and divine seal,--impress of consecration,
   signature of glory, pledge of testimony (for it is said, "He hath set
   to his seal that God is true,") [3806] and shoes, not those perishable
   ones which he hath set his foot on holy ground is bidden take off, nor
   such as he who is sent to preach the kingdom of heaven is forbidden to
   put on, but such as wear not, and are suited for the journey to heaven,
   becoming and adorning the heavenly path, such as unwashed feet never
   put on, but those which are washed by our Teacher and Lord.

   Many, truly, are the shoes of the sinful soul, by which it is bound and
   cramped. For each man is cramped by the cords of his own sins.
   Accordingly, Abraham swears to the king of Sodom, "I will not take of
   all that is thine, from a thread to a shoe-latchet." [3807] On account
   of these being defiled and polluted on the earth, every kind of wrong
   and selfishness engrosses life. As the Lord reproves Israel by Amos,
   saying, "For three iniquities of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn
   him back; because they have given away the righteous for silver, and
   the needy for a pair of shoes, which tread upon the dust of the
   ground." [3808]

   2. Now the shoes which the Father bids the servant give to the
   repentant son who has betaken himself to Him, do not impede or drag to
   the earth (for the earthly tabernacle weighs down the anxious mind);
   but they are buoyant, and ascending, and waft to heaven, and serve as
   such a ladder and chariot as he requires who has turned his mind
   towards the Father. For, beautiful after being first beautifully
   adorned with all these things without, he enters into the gladness
   within. For "Bring out" was said by Him who had first said, "While he
   was yet a great way off, he ran and fell upon his neck." For it is here
   [3809] that all the preparation for entrance to the marriage to which
   we are invited must be accomplished. He, then, who has been made ready
   to enter will say, "This my joy is fulfilled." [3810] But the unlovely
   and unsightly man will hear, "Friend, how camest thou in here, without
   having a wedding garment?" [3811] And the fat and unctuous food,--the
   delicacies abundant and sufficing of the blessed,--the fatted calf is
   killed; which is also again spoken of as a lamb (not literally); that
   no one may suppose it small; but it is the great and greatest. For not
   small is "the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world," [3812]
   who "was led as a sheep to the slaughter," the sacrifice full of
   marrow, all whose fat, according to the sacred law, was the Lord's. For
   He was wholly devoted and consecrated to the Lord; so well grown, and
   to such excessive size, as to reach and extend over all, and to fill
   those who eat Him and feed upon Him. For He is both flesh and bread,
   and has given Himself as both to us to be eaten.

   To the sons, then, who come to Him, the Father gives the calf, and it
   is slain and eaten. But those who do not come to Him He pursues and
   disinherits, and is found to be a most powerful bull. Here, by reason
   of His size and prowess, it is said of Him, "His glory is as that of an
   unicorn." [3813] And the prophet Habakkuk sees Him bearing horns, and
   celebrates His defensive attitude--"horns in His hands." [3814]
   Wherefore the sign shows His power and authority,--horns that pierce on
   both sides, or rather, on all sides, and through everything. And those
   who eat are so strengthened, and retain such strength from the
   life-giving food in them, that they themselves are stronger than their
   enemies, and are all but armed with the horns of a bull; as it is said,
   "In thee shall we butt our enemies." [3815]

   3. Gladness there is, and music, and dances; although the elder son,
   who had ever been with and ever obedient to the Father, takes it ill,
   when he who never had himself been dissipated or profligate sees the
   guilty one made happy.

   Accordingly the Father calls him, saying, "Son, thou art ever with me."
   And what greater joy and feast and festivity can be than being
   continually with God, standing by His side and serving Him? "And all
   that is mine is thine." And blessed is the heir of God, for whom the
   Father holds possession,--the faithful, to whom the whole world of
   possessions belongs.

   "It was meet that we should be glad, and rejoice; for thy brother was
   dead, and is alive again." Kind Father, who givest all things life, and
   raisest the dead. "And was lost, and is found." And "blessed is the man
   whom Thou hast chosen and accepted," [3816] and whom having sought,
   Thou dost find. "Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, whose
   sins are covered." [3817] It is for man to repent of sins; but let this
   be accompanied with a change that will not be checked. For he who does
   not act so shall be put to shame, because he has acted not with his
   whole heart, but in haste.

   And it is ours to flee to God. And let us endeavour after this
   ceaselessly and energetically. For He says, "Come unto Me, all ye that
   labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." [3818] And
   prayer and confession with humility are voluntary acts. Wherefore it is
   enjoined, "First tell thy sins, that thou mayest be justified." [3819]
   What afterwards we shall obtain, and what we shall be, it is not for us
   to judge.

   4. Such is the strict meaning of the parable. [3820] The repentant son
   came to the pitying Father, never hoping for these things,--the best
   robe, and the ring, and the shoes,--or to taste the fatted calf, or to
   share in gladness, or enjoy music and dances; but he would have been
   contented with obtaining what in his own estimation he deemed himself
   worth. "Make me," he had made up his mind to say, "as one of thy hired
   servants." But when he saw the Father's welcome meeting him, he did not
   say this, but said what he had in his mind to say first, "Father, I
   have sinned against Heaven, and before thee." And so both his humility
   and his accusation became the cause of justification and glory. For the
   righteous man condemns himself in his first words. So also the publican
   departed justified rather than the Pharisee. The son, then, knew not
   either what he was to obtain, or how to take or use or put on himself
   the things given him; since he did not take the robe himself, and put
   it on. But it is said, "Put it on him." He did not himself put the ring
   on his finger, but those who were bidden "Put a ring on his hand." Nor
   did he put the shoes on himself, but it was they who heard, "and shoes
   on his feet."

   And these things were perhaps incredible to him and to others, and
   unexpected before they took place; but gladly received and praised were
   the gifts with which he was presented.

   5. The parable exhibits this thought, that the exercise of the faculty
   of reason has been accorded to each man. Wherefore the prodigal is
   introduced, demanding from his father his portion, that is, of the
   state of mind, endowed by reason. For the possession of reason is
   granted to all, in order to the pursuit of what is good, and the
   avoidance of what is bad. But many who are furnished by God with this
   make a bad use of the knowledge that has been given them, and land in
   the profligacy of evil practices, and wickedly waste the substance of
   reason,--the eye on disgraceful sights, the tongue on blasphemous
   words, the smell on foetid licentious excesses of pleasures, the mouth
   on swinish gluttony, the hands on thefts, the feet on running into
   plots, the thoughts on impious counsels, the inclinations on indulgence
   on the love of ease, the mind on brutish pastime. They preserve nothing
   of the substance of reason unsquandered. Such an one, therefore, Christ
   represents in the parable,--as a rational creature, with his reason
   darkened, and asking from the Divine Being what is suitable to reason;
   then as obtaining from God, and making a wicked use of what had been
   given, and especially of the benefits of baptism, which had been
   vouchsafed to him; whence also He calls him a prodigal; and then, after
   the dissipation of what had been given him, and again his restoration
   by repentance, [He represents] the love of God shown to him.

   6. For He says, "Bring hither the fatted calf, kill it, and let us eat
   and be merry; for this my son"--a name of nearest relationship, and
   significative of what is given to the faithful--"was dead and
   lost,"--an expression of extremest alienation; for what is more alien
   to the living than the lost and dead? For neither can be possessed any
   more. But having from the nearest relationship fallen to extremest
   alienation, again by repentance he returned to near relationship. For
   it is said, "Put on him the best robe," which was his the moment he
   obtained baptism. I mean the glory of baptism, the remission of sins,
   and the communication of the other blessings, which he obtained
   immediately he had touched the font.

   "And put a ring on his hand." Here is the mystery of the Trinity; which
   is the seal impressed on those who believe.

   "And put shoes on his feet," for "the preparation of the Gospel of
   peace," [3821] and the whole course that leads to good actions.

   7. But whom Christ finds lost, after sin committed since baptism, those
   Novatus, enemy of God, resigns to destruction. Do not let us then
   reckon any fault if we repent; guarding against falling, let us, if we
   have fallen, retrace our steps. And while dreading to offend, let us,
   after offending, avoid despair, and be eager to be confirmed; and on
   sinking, let us haste to rise up again. Let us obey the Lord, who calls
   to us, "Come unto Me, all ye that labour, and I will give you rest."
   [3822] Let us employ the gift of reason for actions of prudence. Let us
   learn now abstinence from what is wicked, that we may not be forced to
   learn in the future. Let us employ life as a training school for what
   is good; and let us be roused to the hatred of sin. Let us bear about a
   deep love for the Creator; let us cleave to Him with our whole heart;
   let us not wickedly waste the substance of reason, like the prodigal.
   Let us obtain the joy laid up, in which Paul exulting, exclaimed, "Who
   shall separate us from the love of Christ?" [3823] To Him belongs glory
   and honour, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, world without end.
   Amen.

      Macarius Chrysocephalus: Oration VIII. On Matt. viii., and Book VII. On
      Luke xiii.

   Therefore God does not here take the semblance of man, but of a dove,
   because He wished to show the simplicity and gentleness of the new
   manifestation of the Spirit by the likeness of the dove. For the law
   was stern, and punished with the sword; but grace is joyous, and trains
   by the word of meekness. Hence the Lord also says to the apostles, who
   said that He should punish with fire those who would not receive Him,
   after the manner of Elias: "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are
   of." [3824]

      From the Same.--Book XIII. Chap. IX.

   Possibly by the "iota and the tittle" His righteousness exclaims, "If
   ye come right to me, I also will come right to you; if ye walk crooked,
   I also will walk crooked, saith the Lord of hosts," [3825] alluding to
   the offences of sinners under the name of crooked ways. For the
   straight way, and that according to nature, which is pointed out by the
   iota of Jesus, is His goodness, which is immoveable towards those who
   have obediently believed. There shall not then pass away from the law
   neither the iota nor the tittle; that is, neither the promise that
   applies to the straight in the way, nor the punishment threatened
   against those that diverge. For the Lord is good to the straight in the
   way; but "those that turn aside after their crooked ways He shall lead
   forth with those that work iniquity." [3826] "And with the innocent He
   is innocent, and with the froward He is froward;" [3827] and to the
   crooked He sends crooked ways.

   His own luminous image God impressed as with a seal, even the
   greatest,--on man made in His likeness, that he might be ruler and lord
   over all things, and that all things might serve him. Wherefore God
   judges man to be wholly His, and His own image. He is invisible; but
   His image, man, is visible. Whatever one, then, does to man, whether
   good or bad, is referred to Himself. Wherefore from Him judgment shall
   proceed, appointing to all according to desert; for He will avenge His
   own image.

      XII.--Fragments Not Given in the Oxford Edition.

      1. In Anastasius Sinaita, Quest. 96.

   As it is possible even now for man to form men, according to the
   original formation of Adam, He no longer now creates, on account of His
   having granted once for all to man the power of generating men, saying
   to our nature, "Increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth."
   [3828] So also, by His omnipotent and omniscient power, He arranged
   that the dissolution and death of our bodies should be effected by a
   natural sequence and order, through the change of their elements, in
   accordance with His divine knowledge and comprehension.

      2. Joannes Veccus, Patriarch of Constantinople, on the Procession of the
      Spirit. In Leo Allatius, Vol. I. p. 248.

   Further, Clement the Stromatist, in the various definitions which he
   framed, that they might guide the man desirous of studying theology in
   every dogma of religion, defining what spirit is, and how it is called
   spirit, says: "Spirit is a substance, subtle, immaterial, and which
   issues forth without form."

      3. From the Unpublished Disputation Against Iconoclasts, of Nicephorus of
      Constantinople; Edited in Greek and Latin by Le Nourry in His Apparatus to
      the Library of the Fathers, Vol. I. p. 1334 a.b. From Clement the
      Presbyter of Alexandria's Book Against Judaizers.

   Solomon the son of David, in the books styled "The Reigns of the
   Kings," comprehending not only that the structure of the true temple
   was celestial and spiritual, but had also a reference to the flesh,
   which He who was both the son and Lord of David was to build up, both
   for His own presence, where, as a living image, He resolved to make His
   shrine, and for the church that was to rise up through the union of
   faith, says expressly, "Will God in very deed dwell with men on the
   earth?" [3829]

   He dwells on the earth clothed in flesh, and His abode with men is
   effected by the conjunction and harmony which obtains among the
   righteous, and which build and rear a new temple. For the righteous are
   the earth, being still encompassed with the earth; and earth, too, in
   comparison with the greatness of the Lord. Thus also the blessed Peter
   hesitates not to say, "Ye also, as living stones, are built up, a
   spiritual house, a holy temple, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
   acceptable to God by Jesus Christ." [3830]

   And with reference to the body, which by circumscription He consecrated
   as a hallowed place for Himself upon earth, He said, "Destroy this
   temple, and in three days I will raise it up again. The Jews therefore
   said, In forty-six years was this temple built, and wilt thou raise it
   up in three days? But He spake of the temple of His body." [3831]

      4. From ms. Marked 2431 in the Library of the Most Christian King.--Ibid.
      p. 1336 a. From the Very Holy and Blessed Clement, Presbyter of
      Alexandria, the Stromatist's Book on Providence.

   What is God? "God," as the Lord saith, "is a Spirit." Now spirit is
   properly substance, incorporeal, and uncircumscribed. And that is
   incorporeal which does not consist of a body, or whose existence is not
   according to breadth, length, and depth. And that is uncircumscribed
   [3832] which has no place, which is wholly in all, and in each entire,
   and the same in itself.

      5. From the Same ms.--Ibid. 1335 D.

   Phusis (nature) is so called from to pephukenai (to be born). The first
   substance is everything which subsists by itself, as a stone is called
   a substance. The second is a substance capable of increase, as a plant
   grows and decays. The third is animated and sentient substance, as
   animal, horse. The fourth is animate, sentient, rational substance, as
   man. Wherefore each one of us is made as consisting of all, having an
   immaterial soul and a mind, which is the image of God.

      6. In John of Damascus--Parallel--Vol. II. p. 307.

   The fear of God, who is impassible, is free of perturbation. For it is
   not God that one dreads, but the falling away from God. He who dreads
   this, dreads falling into what is evil, and dreads what is evil. And he
   that fears a fall wishes himself to be immortal and passionless.

      7. The Same, p. 341.

   Let there be a law against those who dare to look at things sacred and
   divine irreverently, and in a way unworthy of God, to inflict on them
   the punishment of blindness.

      8. The Same, p. 657.

   Universally, the Christian is friendly to solitude, and quiet, and
   tranquillity, and peace.

      9. From the Catena on the Pentateuch, Published in Latin by Francis
      Zephyrus, p. 146.

   That mystic name which is called the Tetragrammaton, by which alone
   they who had access to the Holy of Holies were protected, is pronounced
   Jehovah, which means, "Who is, and who shall be." The candlestick which
   stood at the south of the altar signified the seven planets, which seem
   to us to revolve around the meridian, [3833] on either side of which
   rise three branches; since the sun also like the lamp, balanced in the
   midst of the planets by divine wisdom, illumines by its light those
   above and below. On the other side of the altar was situated the table
   on which the loaves were displayed, because from that quarter of the
   heaven vital and nourishing breezes blow.

      10. From J. A. Cramer's Catenæ Græcorum Patrum in Nov. Test. Oxford 1840
      Vol. III.

   On Acts vii. 24. The mystics say that it was by his word alone that
   Moses slew the Egyptian; as certainly afterwards it is related in the
   Acts that [Peter] slew with his word those who kept back part of the
   price of the land, and lied.

      II. The Same, Vol. IV. p. 291.

   On Rom. viii. 38. "Or life, that of our present existence," and
   "death,"--that caused by the assault of persecutors, and "angels, and
   principalities, and powers," apostate spirits.

      12. p. 369, Chap. x. 3.

   And having neither known nor done the requirement of the law, what they
   conceived, that they also thought that the law required. And they did
   not believe the law, as prophesying, but the bare word; and followed it
   from fear, but not with their disposition and in faith.

      13. Vol. VI. p. 385.

   On 2 Cor. v. 16. "And if we have known Christ after the flesh."

   And so far, he says, no one any longer lives after the flesh. For that
   is not life, but death. For Christ also, that He might show this,
   [3834] ceased to live after the flesh. How? Not by putting off the
   body! Far be it! For with it as His own He shall come, the Judge of
   all. But by divesting Himself of physical affections, such as hunger,
   and thirst, and sleep, and weariness. For now He has a body incapable
   of suffering and of injury.

   As "after the flesh" in our case is being in the midst of sins, and
   being out of them is to be "not after the flesh;" so also after the
   flesh, in the case of Christ, was His subjection to natural affections,
   and not to be subject to them was not to be "after the flesh." "But,"
   he says, "as He was released, so also are we." [3835] Let there be no
   longer, he says, subjection to the influences of the flesh. Thus
   Clement, the fourth book of the Hypotyposes.

      14. From the Same, p. 391.

   On 2 Cor. vi. 11. "Our heart is enlarged."

   For as heat is wont to expand, so also love. For love is a thing of
   warmth. As if he would say, I love you not only with mouth, but with
   heart, and have you all within. Wherefore he says: "ye are not
   straitened in us, since desire itself expands the soul." "Our heart is
   enlarged" to teach you all things; "but ye are straitened in your own
   bowels," that is, in love to God, in which you ought to love me.

   Thus Clement, in the fourth book of the Hypotyposes.

      15. From Vol. III. V. 286.

   Heb. i. 1. "At sundry times and divers manners."

   Since the Lord, being the Apostle of the Almighty, was sent to the
   Hebrews, it was out of modesty that Paul did not subscribe himself
   apostle of the Hebrews, from reverence for the Lord, and because he was
   the herald and apostle of the Gentiles, and wrote the Epistle to the
   Hebrews in addition [to his proper work]. [3836]

      16. From the Same.

   The same work contains a passage from The Instructor, book i. chap. vi.
   [3837] The passage is that beginning, "For the blood is found to be,"
   down to "potent charms of affection." Portions, however, are omitted.
   There are a good many various readings; but although the passage in
   question, as found in Cramer's work, is printed in full in Migne's
   edition, on the alleged ground of the considerable variation from the
   text of Clement, the variation is not such as to make a translation of
   the passage as found in Cramer of any special interest or value.

   We have noted the following readings:--

   ginetai, where, the verb being omitted, we have inserted is: There is
   an obstruction, etc.

   suringas, tubes, instead of serangas (hollows), hollows of the breasts.

   geitniazouson, for geitniouson, neighbouring (arteries).

   epilepsei, for emperilepsei, interruption (such as this).

   apoklerosis occurs as in the text, for which the emendation apoleresis,
   as specified in the note, has been adopted.

   hetis esti, omitted here, which is "sweet through grace," is supplied.

      P. 142.

   gala, milk, instead of manna, manna, (that food) manna.

      P. 149.

   chre de katanoesai ten phusin (but it is necessary to consider nature),
   for ou katanenoekotes, t. ph., through want of consideration of nature.

   katakleiomeno, agreeing with food, for katakleiomeno, agreeing with
   heat (enclosed within).

   ginetai for gar (which is untranslated), (the blood) is (a preparation)
   for milk.

      P. 144.

   toinun ton logon is supplied, and eikotos omitted in the clause, Paul
   using appropriate figurative language.

      P. 145.

   ple n is supplied before alla to en aute, and the blood in it, etc., is
   omitted.

      P. 146.

   "For Diogenes Apolloniates will have it" is omitted.

   pante, rendered "in all respects," is connected with the preceding
   sentence.

      P. 147.

   hoti toinun, for Hos d'. And that (milk is produced).

   tenikauta for tenikade in the clause, "and the grass and meadows are
   juicy and moist," not translated.

   proeiremeno, above mentioned (milk), omitted.

   truphes for trophes, (sweet) nutriment.

   to omitted before glukei, sweet (wine), and kathaper, "as, when
   suffering."

   to liparon for to liparo, and aridelos for aridelou, in the sentence:
   "Further, many use the fat of milk, called butter, for the lamp,
   plainly," etc.

   N. B.

   [Le Nourry decides that the Adumbrations were not translated from the
   Hypotyposes, but Kaye (p. 473) thinks on insufficient grounds. See,
   also (p. 5), Kaye's learned note.]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3712] [M. Aurelius Cassiodorus (whose name is also Senator) was an
   author and public man of the sixth century, and a very voluminous
   writer. He would shine with a greater lustre were he not so nearly lost
   in the brighter light of Boëthius, his illustrious contemporary. After
   the death of his patron, Theodoric, he continued for a time in the
   public service, and in high positions, but, at seventy years of age,
   began another career, and for twenty years devoted himself to letters
   and the practice of piety in a monastery which he established in the
   Neopolitan kingdom, near his native Squillace. Died about a.d. 560.]

   [3713] Comments, i.e., Adumbrationes. Cassiodorus says that he had in
   his translation corrected what he considered erroneous in the original.
   So Fell states: and he is also inclined to believe that these fragments
   are from Clement's lost work, the Hupotuposeis, of which he believes
   The Adumbrationes of Cassiodorus to be a translation.

   [3714] "Utramque" is the reading, which is plainly corrupt. We have
   conjectured "animam." The rest of the sentence is so ungrammatical and
   impracticable as it stands, that it is only by taking considerable
   liberties with it that it is translateable at all.

   [3715] The text here has like a drag-net or (sicut sagena vel), which
   we have omitted, being utterly incapable of divining any conceivable
   resemblance or analogy which a drag-net can afford for the re-union of
   the soul and body. "Sagena" is either a blunder for something else
   which we cannot conjecture, or the sentence is here, as elsewhere,
   mutilated. But it is possible that it may have been the union of the
   blessed to each other, and their conjunction with one another according
   to their affinities, which was the point handled in the original
   sentences, of which we have only these obscure and confusing remains.
   [A very good conjecture, on the strength of which the text might have
   been let as it stood.]

   [3716] Chap. ii. 5.

   [3717] "Coeli," plainly a mistake for "coelo" or "coelis." There is
   apparently a hiatus here. "The angelic abode, guarded in heaven," most
   probably is the explanation of "an inheritance incorruptible and
   undefiled, reserved in heaven."

      on the

Salvation of the Rich Man.

    [Translated by Rev. William Wilson, M.A.]
     __________________________________________________________________

Who is the Rich Man that Shall Be Saved?
     __________________________________________________________________

   I. Those who bestow laudatory addresses on the rich [3838] appear to me
   to be rightly judged not only flatterers and base, in vehemently
   pretending that things which are disagreeable give them pleasure, but
   also godless and treacherous; godless, because neglecting to praise and
   glorify God, who is alone perfect and good, "of whom are all things,
   and by whom are all things, and for whom are all things," [3839] they
   invest [3840] with divine honours men wallowing in an execrable and
   abominable life, and, what is the principal thing, liable on this
   account to the judgment of God; and treacherous, because, although
   wealth is of itself sufficient to puff up and corrupt the souls of its
   possessors, and to turn them from the path by which salvation is to be
   attained, they stupefy them still more, by inflating the minds of the
   rich with the pleasures of extravagant praises, and by making them
   utterly despise all things except wealth, on account of which they are
   admired; bringing, as the saying is, fire to fire, pouring pride on
   pride, and adding conceit to wealth, a heavier burden to that which by
   nature is a weight, from which somewhat ought rather to be removed and
   taken away as being a dangerous and deadly disease. For to him who
   exalts and magnifies himself, the change and downfall to a low
   condition succeeds in turn, as the divine word teaches. For it appears
   to me to be far kinder, than basely to flatter the rich and praise them
   for what is bad, to aid them in working out their salvation in every
   possible way; asking this of God, who surely and sweetly bestows such
   things on His own children; and thus by the grace of the Saviour
   healing their souls, enlightening them and leading them to the
   attainment of the truth; and whosoever obtains this and distinguishes
   himself in good works shall gain the prize of everlasting life. Now
   prayer that runs its course till the last day of life needs a strong
   and tranquil soul; and the conduct of life needs a good and righteous
   disposition, reaching out towards all the commandments of the Saviour.

   II. Perhaps the reason of salvation appearing more difficult to the
   rich than to poor men, is not single but manifold. For some, merely
   hearing, and that in an off-hand way, the utterance of the Saviour,
   "that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than
   for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven," [3841] despair of
   themselves as not destined to live, surrender all to the world, cling
   to the present life as if it alone was left to them, and so diverge
   more from the way to the life to come, no longer inquiring either whom
   the Lord and Master calls rich, or how that which is impossible to man
   becomes possible to God. But others rightly and adequately comprehend
   this, but attaching slight importance to the works which tend to
   salvation, do not make the requisite preparation for attaining to the
   objects of their hope. And I affirm both of these things of the rich
   who have learned both the Saviour's power and His glorious salvation.
   With those who are ignorant of the truth I have little concern.

   III. Those then who are actuated by a love of the truth and love of
   their brethren, and neither are rudely insolent towards such rich as
   are called, nor, on the other hand, cringe to them for their own
   avaricious ends, must first by the word relieve them of their
   groundless despair, and show with the requisite explanation of the
   oracles of the Lord that the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven is
   not quite cut off from them if they obey the commandments; then
   admonish them that they entertain a causeless fear, and that the Lord
   gladly receives them, provided they are willing; and then, in addition,
   exhibit and teach how and by what deeds and dispositions they shall win
   the objects of hope, inasmuch as it is neither out of their reach, nor,
   on the other hand, attained without effort; but, as is the case with
   athletes--to compare things small and perishing with things great and
   immortal--let the man who is endowed with worldly wealth reckon that
   this depends on himself. For among those, one man, because he despaired
   of being able to conquer and gain crowns, did not give in his name for
   the contest; while another, whose mind was inspired with this hope, and
   yet did not submit to the appropriate labours, and diet, and exercises,
   remained uncrowned, and was balked in his expectations. So also let not
   the man that has been invested with worldly wealth proclaim himself
   excluded at the outset from the Saviour's lists, provided he is a
   believer and one who contemplates the greatness of God's philanthropy;
   nor let him, on the other hand, expect to grasp the crowns of
   immortality without struggle and effort, continuing untrained, and
   without contest. But let him go and put himself under the Word as his
   trainer, and Christ the President of the contest; and for his
   prescribed food and drink let him have the New Testament of the Lord;
   and for exercises, the commandments; and for elegance and ornament, the
   fair dispositions, love, faith, hope, knowledge of the truth,
   gentleness, meekness, pity, gravity: so that, when by the last trumpet
   the signal shall be given for the race and departure hence, as from the
   stadium of life, he may with a good conscience present himself
   victorious before the Judge who confers the rewards, confessedly worthy
   of the Fatherland on high, to which he returns with crowns and the
   acclamations of angels.

   IV. May the Saviour then grant to us that, having begun the subject
   from this point, we may contribute to the brethren what is true, and
   suitable, and saving, first touching the hope itself, and, second,
   touching the access to the hope. He indeed grants to those who beg, and
   teaches those who ask, and dissipates ignorance and dispels despair, by
   introducing again the same words about the rich, which become their own
   interpreters and infallible expounders. For there is nothing like
   listening again to the very same statements, which till now in the
   Gospels were distressing you, hearing them as you did without
   examination, and erroneously through puerility: "And going forth into
   the way, one approached and kneeled, saying, Good Master, what good
   thing shall I do that I may inherit everlasting life? And Jesus saith,
   Why callest thou Me good? There is none good but one, that is, God.
   Thou knowest the commandments. Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do
   not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father
   and thy mother. And he answering saith to Him, All these have I
   observed. And Jesus, looking upon him, loved him, and said, One thing
   thou lackest. If thou wouldest be perfect, sell what thou hast and give
   to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow
   Me. And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he was
   rich, having great possessions. And Jesus looked round about, and saith
   to His disciples, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the
   kingdom of God! And the disciples were astonished at His words. But
   Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it
   for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! More
   easily shall a camel enter through the eye of a needle than a rich man
   into the kingdom of God. And they were astonished out of measure, and
   said, Who then can be saved? And He, looking upon them, said, What is
   impossible with men is possible with God. For with God all things are
   possible. Peter began to say to Him, Lo, we have left all and followed
   Thee. And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, Whosoever
   shall leave what is his own, parents, and brethren, and possessions,
   for My sake and the Gospel's, shall receive an hundred-fold now in this
   world, lands, and possessions, and house, and brethren, with
   persecutions; and in the world to come is life everlasting. But many
   that are first shall be last, and the last first." [3842]

   V. These things are written in the Gospel according to Mark; and in all
   the rest correspondingly; although perchance the expressions vary
   slightly in each, yet all show identical agreement in meaning.

   But well knowing that the Saviour teaches nothing in a merely human
   way, but teaches all things to His own with divine and mystic wisdom,
   we must not listen to His utterances carnally; but with due
   investigation and intelligence must search out and learn the meaning
   hidden in them. For even those things which seem to have been
   simplified to the disciples by the Lord Himself are found to require
   not less, even more, attention than what is expressed enigmatically,
   from the surpassing superabundance of wisdom in them. And whereas the
   things which are thought to have been explained by Him to those
   within--those called by Him the children of the kingdom--require still
   more consideration than the things which seemed to have been expressed
   simply, and respecting which therefore no questions were asked by those
   who heard them, but which, pertaining to the entire design of
   salvation, and to be contemplated with admirable and supercelestial
   depth of mind, we must not receive superficially with our ears, but
   with application of the mind to the very spirit of the Saviour, and the
   unuttered meaning of the declaration.

   VI. For our Lord and Saviour was asked pleasantly a question most
   appropriate for Him,--the Life respecting life, the Saviour respecting
   salvation, the Teacher respecting the chief doctrines taught, the Truth
   respecting the true immortality, the Word respecting the word of the
   Father, the Perfect respecting the perfect rest, the Immortal
   respecting the sure immortality. He was asked respecting those things
   on account of which He descended, which He inculcates, which He
   teaches, which He offers, in order to show the essence of the Gospel,
   that it is the gift of eternal life. For He foresaw as God, both what
   He would be asked, and what each one would answer Him. For who should
   do this more than the Prophet of prophets, and the Lord of every
   prophetic spirit? And having been called "good," and taking the
   starting note from this first expression, He commences His teaching
   with this, turning the pupil to God, the good, and first and only
   dispenser of eternal life, which the Son, who received it of Him, gives
   to us.

   VII. Wherefore the greatest and chiefest point of the instructions
   which relate to life must be implanted in the soul from the
   beginning,--to know the eternal God, the giver of what is eternal, and
   by knowledge and comprehension to possess God, who is first, and
   highest, and one, and good. For this is the immutable and immoveable
   source and support of life, the knowledge of God, who really is, and
   who bestows the things which really are, that is, those which are
   eternal, from whom both being and the continuance [3843] of it are
   derived to other beings. For ignorance of Him is death; but the
   knowledge and appropriation of Him, and love and likeness to Him, are
   the only life.

   VIII. He then who would live the true life is enjoined first to know
   Him "whom no one knows, except the Son reveal (Him)." [3844] Next is to
   be learned the greatness of the Saviour after Him, and the newness of
   grace; for, according to the apostle, "the law was given by Moses,
   grace and truth came by Jesus Christ;" [3845] and the gifts granted
   through a faithful servant are not equal to those bestowed by the true
   Son. If then the law of Moses had been sufficient to confer eternal
   life, it were to no purpose for the Saviour Himself to come and suffer
   for us, accomplishing the course of human life from His birth to His
   cross; and to no purpose for him who had done all the commandments of
   the law from his youth to fall on his knees and beg from another
   immortality. For he had not only fulfilled the law, but had begun to do
   so from his very earliest youth. For what is there great or
   pre-eminently illustrious in an old age which is unproductive of
   faults? But if one in juvenile frolicsomeness and the fire of youth
   shows a mature judgment older than his years, this is a champion
   admirable and distinguished, and hoary pre-eminently in mind.

   But, nevertheless, this man being such, is perfectly persuaded that
   nothing is wanting to him as far as respects righteousness, but that he
   is entirely destitute of life. Wherefore he asks it from Him who alone
   is able to give it. And with reference to the law, he carries
   confidence; but the Son of God he addresses in supplication. He is
   transferred from faith to faith. As perilously tossing and occupying a
   dangerous anchorage in the law, he makes for the Saviour to find a
   haven.

   IX. Jesus, accordingly, does not charge him with not having fulfilled
   all things out of the law, but loves him, and fondly welcomes his
   obedience in what he had learned; but says that he is not perfect as
   respects eternal life, inasmuch as he had not fulfilled what is
   perfect, and that he is a doer indeed of the law, but idle at the true
   life. Those things, indeed, are good. Who denies it? For "the
   commandment is holy," [3846] as far as a sort of training with fear and
   preparatory discipline goes, leading as it did to the culmination of
   legislation and to grace. [3847] But Christ is the fulfilment "of the
   law for righteousness to every one that believeth;" and not as a slave
   making slaves, but sons, and brethren, and fellow-heirs, who perform
   the Father's will.

   X. "If thou wilt be perfect." [3848] Consequently he was not yet
   perfect. For nothing is more perfect than what is perfect. And divinely
   the expression "if thou wilt" showed the self-determination of the soul
   holding converse with Him. For choice depended on the man as being
   free; but the gift on God as the Lord. And He gives to those who are
   willing and are exceedingly earnest, and ask, that so their salvation
   may become their own. For God compels not (for compulsion is repugnant
   to God), but supplies to those who seek, and bestows on those who ask,
   and opens to those who knock. If thou wilt, then, if thou really
   willest, and art not deceiving thyself, acquire what thou lackest. One
   thing is lacking thee,--the one thing which abides, the good, that
   which is now above the law, which the law gives not, which the law
   contains not, which is the prerogative of those who live. He forsooth
   who had fulfilled all the demands of the law from his youth, and had
   gloried in what was magnificent, was not able to complete the whole
   [3849] with this one thing which was specially required by the Saviour,
   so as to receive the eternal life which he desired. But he departed
   displeased, vexed at the commandment of the life, on account of which
   he supplicated. For he did not truly wish life, as he averred, but
   aimed at the mere reputation of the good choice. And he was capable of
   busying himself about many things; but the one thing, the work of life,
   he was powerless, and disinclined, and unable to accomplish. Such also
   was what the Lord said to Martha, who was occupied with many things,
   and distracted and troubled with serving; while she blamed her sister,
   because, leaving serving, she set herself at His feet, devoting her
   time to learning: "Thou art troubled about many things, but Mary hath
   chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her." [3850]
   So also He bade him leave his busy life, and cleave to One and adhere
   to the grace of Him who offered everlasting life.

   XI. What then was it which persuaded him to flight, and made him depart
   from the Master, from the entreaty, the hope, the life, previously
   pursued with ardour?--"Sell thy possessions." And what is this? He does
   not, as some conceive off-hand, bid him throw away the substance he
   possessed, and abandon his property; but bids him banish from his soul
   his notions about wealth, his excitement and morbid feeling about it,
   the anxieties, which are the thorns of existence, which choke the seed
   of life. For it is no great thing or desirable to be destitute of
   wealth, if without a special object,--not except on account of life.
   For thus those who have nothing at all, but are destitute, and beggars
   for their daily bread, the poor dispersed on the streets, who know not
   God and God's righteousness, simply on account of their extreme want
   and destitution of subsistence, and lack even of the smallest things,
   were most blessed and most dear to God, and sole possessors of
   everlasting life.

   Nor was the renunciation of wealth and the bestowment of it on the poor
   or needy a new thing; for many did so before the Saviour's
   advent,--some because of the leisure (thereby obtained) for learning,
   and on account of a dead wisdom; and others for empty fame and
   vainglory, as the Anaxagorases, the Democriti, and the Crateses.

   XII. Why then command as new, as divine, as alone life-giving, what did
   not save those of former days? And what peculiar thing is it that the
   new creature [3851] the Son of God intimates and teaches? It is not the
   outward act which others have done, but something else indicated by it,
   greater, more godlike, more perfect, the stripping off of the passions
   from the soul itself and from the disposition, and the cutting up by
   the roots and casting out of what is alien to the mind. For this is the
   lesson peculiar to the believer, and the instruction worthy of the
   Saviour. For those who formerly despised external things relinquished
   and squandered their property, but the passions of the soul, I believe,
   they intensified. For they indulged in arrogance, pretension, and
   vainglory, and in contempt of the rest of mankind, as if they had done
   something superhuman. How then would the Saviour have enjoined on those
   destined to live for ever what was injurious and hurtful with reference
   to the life which He promised? For although such is the case, one,
   after ridding himself of the burden of wealth, may none the less have
   still the lust and desire for money innate and living; and may have
   abandoned the use of it, but being at once destitute of and desiring
   what he spent, may doubly grieve both on account of the absence of
   attendance, and the presence of regret. For it is impossible and
   inconceivable that those in want of the necessaries of life should not
   be harassed in mind, and hindered from better things in the endeavour
   to provide them somehow, and from some source.

   XIII. And how much more beneficial the opposite case, for a man,
   through possessing a competency, both not himself to be in straits
   about money, and also to give assistance to those to whom it is
   requisite so to do! For if no one had anything, what room would be left
   among men for giving? And how can this dogma fail to be found plainly
   opposed to and conflicting with many other excellent teachings of the
   Lord? "Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,
   that when ye fail, they may receive you into the everlasting
   habitations." [3852] "Acquire treasures in heaven, where neither moth
   nor rust destroys, nor thieves break through." [3853] How could one
   give food to the hungry, and drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked,
   and shelter the houseless, for not doing which He threatens with fire
   and the outer darkness, if each man first divested himself of all these
   things? Nay, He bids Zaccheus and Matthew, the rich tax-gathers,
   entertain Him hospitably. And He does not bid them part with their
   property, but, applying the just and removing the unjust judgment, He
   subjoins, "To-day salvation has come to this house, forasmuch as he
   also is a son of Abraham." [3854] He so praises the use of property as
   to enjoin, along with this addition, the giving a share of it, to give
   drink to the thirsty, bread to the hungry, to take the houseless in,
   and clothe the naked. But if it is not possible to supply those needs
   without substance, and He bids people abandon their substance, what
   else would the Lord be doing than exhorting to give and not to give the
   same things, to feed and not to feed, to take in and to shut out, to
   share and not to share? which were the most irrational of all things.

   XIV. Riches, then, which benefit also our neighbours, are not to be
   thrown away. For they are possessions, inasmuch as they are possessed,
   and goods, inasmuch as they are useful and provided by God for the use
   of men; and they lie to our hand, and are put under our power, as
   material and instruments which are for good use to those who know the
   instrument. If you use it skilfully, it is skilful; if you are
   deficient in skill, it is affected by your want of skill, being itself
   destitute of blame. Such an instrument is wealth. Are you able to make
   a right use of it? It is subservient to righteousness. Does one make a
   wrong use of it? It is, on the other hand, a minister of wrong. For its
   nature is to be subservient, not to rule. That then which of itself has
   neither good nor evil, being blameless, ought not to be blamed; but
   that which has the power of using it well and ill, by reason of its
   possessing voluntary choice. And this is the mind and judgment of man,
   which has freedom in itself and self-determination in the treatment of
   what is assigned to it. So let no man destroy wealth, rather than the
   passions of the soul, which are incompatible with the better use of
   wealth. So that, becoming virtuous and good, he may be able to make a
   good use of these riches. The renunciation, then, and selling of all
   possessions, is to be understood as spoken of the passions of the soul.

   XV. I would then say this. Since some things are within and some
   without the soul, and if the soul make a good use of them, they also
   are reputed good, but if a bad, bad;--whether does He who commands us
   to alienate our possessions repudiate those things, after the removal
   of which the passions still remain, or those rather, on the removal of
   which wealth even becomes beneficial? If therefore he who casts away
   worldly wealth can still be rich in the passions, even though the
   material [for their gratification] is absent,--for the disposition
   produces its own effects, and strangles the reason, and presses it down
   and inflames it with its inbred lusts,--it is then of no advantage to
   him to be poor in purse while he is rich in passions. For it is not
   what ought to be cast away that he has cast away, but what is
   indifferent; and he has deprived himself of what is serviceable, but
   set on fire the innate fuel of evil through want of the external means
   [of gratification]. We must therefore renounce those possessions that
   are injurious, not those that are capable of being serviceable, if one
   knows the right use of them. And what is managed with wisdom, and
   sobriety, and piety, is profitable; and what is hurtful must be cast
   away. But things external hurt not. So then the Lord introduces the use
   of external things, bidding us put away not the means of subsistence,
   but what uses them badly. And these are the infirmities and passions of
   the soul.

   XVI. The presence of wealth in these is deadly to all, the loss of it
   salutary. Of which, making the soul pure,--that is, poor and bare,--we
   must hear the Saviour speaking thus, "Come, follow Me." For to the pure
   in heart He now becomes the way. But into the impure soul the grace of
   God finds no entrance. And that (soul) is unclean which is rich in
   lusts, and is in the throes of many worldly affections. For he who
   holds possessions, and gold, and silver, and houses, as the gifts of
   God; and ministers from them to the God who gives them for the
   salvation of men; and knows that he possesses them more for the sake of
   the brethren than his own; and is superior to the possession of them,
   not the slave of the things he possesses; and does not carry them about
   in his soul, nor bind and circumscribe his life within them, but is
   ever labouring at some good and divine work, even should he be
   necessarily some time or other deprived of them, is able with cheerful
   mind to bear their removal equally with their abundance. This is he who
   is blessed by the Lord, and called poor in spirit, a meet heir of the
   kingdom of heaven, not one who could not live rich.

   XVII. But he who carries his riches in his soul, and instead of God's
   Spirit bears in his heart gold or land, and is always acquiring
   possessions without end, and is perpetually on the outlook for more,
   bending downwards and fettered in the toils of the world, being earth
   and destined to depart to earth,--whence can he be able to desire and
   to mind the kingdom of heaven,--a man who carries not a heart, but land
   or metal, who must perforce be found in the midst of the objects he has
   chosen? For where the mind of man is, there is also his treasure. The
   Lord acknowledges a twofold treasure,--the good: "For the good man, out
   of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth good;" and the evil:
   for "the evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth evil: for
   out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." [3855] As then
   treasure is not one with Him, as also it is with us, that which gives
   the unexpected great gain in the finding, but also a second, which is
   profitless and undesirable, an evil acquisition, hurtful; so also there
   is a richness in good things, and a richness in bad things, since we
   know that riches and treasure are not by nature separated from each
   other. And the one sort of riches is to be possessed and acquired, and
   the other not to be possessed, but to be cast away.

   In the same way spiritual poverty is blessed. Wherefore also Matthew
   added, "Blessed are the poor." [3856] How? "In spirit." And again,
   "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after the righteousness of
   God." [3857] Wherefore wretched are the contrary kind of poor, who have
   no part in God, and still less in human property, and have not tasted
   of the righteousness of God.

   XVIII. So that (the expression) rich men that shall with difficulty
   enter into the kingdom, is to be apprehended in a scholarly [3858] way,
   not awkwardly, or rustically, or carnally. For if the expression is
   used thus, salvation does not depend on external things, whether they
   be many or few, small or great, or illustrious or obscure, or esteemed
   or disesteemed; but on the virtue of the soul, on faith, and hope, and
   love, and brotherliness, and knowledge, and meekness, and humility, and
   truth, the reward of which is salvation. For it is not on account of
   comeliness of body that any one shall live, or, on the other hand,
   perish. But he who uses the body given to him chastely and according to
   God, shall live; and he that destroys the temple of God shall be
   destroyed. An ugly man can be profligate, and a good-looking man
   temperate. Neither strength and great size of body makes alive, nor
   does any of the members destroy. But the soul which uses them provides
   the cause for each. Bear then, it is said, when struck on the face;
   [3859] which a man strong and in good health can obey. And again, a man
   who is feeble may transgress from refractoriness of temper. So also a
   poor and destitute man may be found intoxicated with lusts; and a man
   rich in worldly goods temperate, poor in indulgences, trustworthy,
   intelligent, pure, chastened.

   If then it is the soul which, first and especially, is that which is to
   live, and if virtue springing up around it saves, and vice kills; then
   it is clearly manifest that by being poor in those things, by riches of
   which one destroys it, it is saved, and by being rich in those things,
   riches of which ruin it, it is killed. And let us no longer seek the
   cause of the issue elsewhere than in the state and disposition of the
   soul in respect of obedience to God and purity, and in respect of
   transgression of the commandments and accumulation of wickedness.

   XIX. He then is truly and rightly rich who is rich in virtue, and is
   capable of making a holy and faithful use of any fortune; while he is
   spuriously rich who is rich, according to the flesh, and turns life
   into outward possession, which is transitory and perishing, and now
   belongs to one, now to another, and in the end to nobody at all. Again,
   in the same way there is a genuine poor man, and another counterfeit
   and falsely so called. He that is poor in spirit, and that is the right
   thing, and he that is poor in a worldly sense, which is a different
   thing. To him who is poor in worldly goods, but rich in vices, who is
   not poor in spirit [3860] and rich toward God, it is said, Abandon the
   alien possessions that are in thy soul, that, becoming pure in heart,
   thou mayest see God; which is another way of saying, Enter into the
   kingdom of heaven. And how may you abandon them? By selling them. What
   then? Are you to take money for effects, by effecting an exchange of
   riches, by turning your visible substance into money? Not at all. But
   by introducing, instead of what was formerly inherent in your soul,
   which you desire to save, other riches which deify and which minister
   everlasting life, dispositions in accordance with the command of God;
   for which there shall accrue to you endless reward and honour, and
   salvation, and everlasting immortality. It is thus that thou dost
   rightly sell the possessions, many are superfluous, which shut the
   heavens against thee by exchanging them for those which are able to
   save. Let the former be possessed by the carnal poor, who are destitute
   of the latter. But thou, by receiving instead spiritual wealth, shalt
   have now treasure in the heavens.

   XX. The wealthy and legally correct man, not understanding these things
   figuratively, nor how the same man can be both poor and rich, and have
   wealth and not have it, and use the world and not use it, went away sad
   and downcast, leaving the state of life, which he was able merely to
   desire but not to attain, making for himself the difficult impossible.
   For it was difficult for the soul not to be seduced and ruined by the
   luxuries and flowery enchantments that beset remarkable wealth; but it
   was not impossible, even surrounded with it, for one to lay hold of
   salvation, provided he withdrew himself from material wealth,--to that
   which is grasped by the mind and taught by God, and learned to use
   things indifferent rightly and properly, and so as to strive after
   eternal life. And the disciples even themselves were at first alarmed
   and amazed. Why were they so on hearing this? Was it that they
   themselves possessed much wealth? Nay, they had long ago left their
   very nets, and hooks, and rowing boats, which were their sole
   possessions. Why then do they say in consternation, "Who can be saved?"
   They had heard well and like disciples what was spoken in parable and
   obscurely by the Lord, and perceived the depth of the words. For they
   were sanguine of salvation on the ground of their want of wealth. But
   when they became conscious of not having yet wholly renounced the
   passions (for they were neophytes and recently selected by the
   Saviour), they were excessively astonished, and despaired of themselves
   no less than that rich man who clung so terribly to the wealth which he
   preferred to eternal life. It was therefore a fit subject for all fear
   on the disciples' part; if both he that possesses wealth and he that is
   teeming with passions were the rich, and these alike shall be expelled
   from the heavens. For salvation is the privilege of pure and
   passionless souls.

   XXI. But the Lord replies, "Because what is impossible with men is
   possible with God." This again is full of great wisdom. For a man by
   himself working and toiling at freedom from passion achieves nothing.
   But if he plainly shows himself very desirous and earnest about this,
   he attains it by the addition of the power of God. For God conspires
   with willing souls. But if they abandon their eagerness, the spirit
   which is bestowed by God is also restrained. For to save the unwilling
   is the part of one exercising compulsion; but to save the willing, that
   of one showing grace. Nor does the kingdom of heaven belong to sleepers
   and sluggards, "but the violent take it by force." [3861] For this
   alone is commendable violence, to force God, and take life from God by
   force. And He, knowing those who persevere firmly, or rather violently,
   yields and grants. For God delights in being vanquished in such things.

   Therefore on hearing those words, the blessed Peter, the chosen, the
   pre-eminent, the first of the disciples, for whom alone and Himself the
   Saviour paid tribute, [3862] quickly seized and comprehended the
   saying. And what does he say? "Lo, we have left all and followed Thee."
   Now if by all he means his own property, he boasts of leaving four
   oboli perhaps in all, [3863] and forgets to show the kingdom of heaven
   to be their recompense. But if, casting away what we were now speaking
   of, the old mental possessions and soul diseases, they follow in the
   Master's footsteps, this now joins them to those who are to be enrolled
   in the heavens. For it is thus that one truly follows the Saviour, by
   aiming at sinlessness and at His perfection, and adorning and composing
   the soul before it as a mirror, and arranging everything in all
   respects similarly.

   XXII. "And Jesus answering said, Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall
   leave what is his own, parents, and children, and wealth, for My sake
   and the Gospel's, shall receive an hundredfold." [3864] But let neither
   this trouble you, nor the still harder saying delivered in another
   place in the words, "Whoso hateth not father, and mother, and children,
   and his own life besides, cannot be My disciple." [3865] For the God of
   peace, who also exhorts to love enemies, does not introduce hatred and
   dissolution from those that are dearest. But if we are to love our
   enemies, it is in accordance with right reason that, ascending from
   them, we should love also those nearest in kindred. Or if we are to
   hate our blood-relations, deduction teaches us that much more are we to
   spurn from us our enemies. So that the reasonings would be shown to
   destroy one another. But they do not destroy each other, nor are they
   near doing so. For from the same feeling and disposition, and on the
   ground of the same rule, one loving his enemy may hate his father,
   inasmuch as he neither takes vengeance on an enemy, nor reverences a
   father more than Christ. For by the one word he extirpates hatred and
   injury, and by the other shamefacedness towards one's relations, if it
   is detrimental to salvation. If then one's father, or son, or brother,
   be godless, and become a hindrance to faith and an impediment to the
   higher life, let him not be friends or agree with him, but on account
   of the spiritual enmity, let him dissolve the fleshly relationship.

   XXIII. Suppose the matter to be a law-suit. Let your father be imagined
   to present himself to you and say, "I begot and reared thee. Follow me,
   and join with me in wickedness, and obey not the law of Christ;" and
   whatever a man who is a blasphemer and dead by nature would say.

   But on the other side hear the Saviour: "I regenerated thee, who wert
   ill born by the world to death. I emancipated, healed, ransomed thee. I
   will show thee the face of the good Father God. Call no man thy father
   on earth. Let the dead bury the dead; but follow thou Me. For I will
   bring thee to a rest [3866] of ineffable and unutterable blessings,
   which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart
   of men; into which angels desire to look, and see what good things God
   hath prepared for the saints and the children who love Him." [3867] I
   am He who feeds thee, giving Myself as bread, of which he who has
   tasted experiences death no more, and supplying day by day the drink of
   immortality. I am teacher of supercelestial lessons. For thee I
   contended with Death, and paid thy death, which thou owedst for thy
   former sins and thy unbelief towards God."

   Having heard these considerations on both sides, decide for thyself and
   give thy vote for thine own salvation. Should a brother say the like,
   should a child, should a wife, should any one whosoever, in preference
   to all let Christ in thee be conqueror. For He contends in thy behalf.

   XXIV. You may even go against wealth. Say, "Certainly Christ does not
   debar me from property. The Lord does not envy." But do you see
   yourself overcome and overthrown by it? Leave it, throw it away, hate,
   renounce, flee. "Even if thy right eye offend thee," quickly "cut it
   out." [3868] Better is the kingdom of God to a man with one eye, than
   the fire to one who is unmutilated. Whether hand, or foot, or soul,
   hate it. For if it is destroyed here for Christ's sake, it will be
   restored to life yonder.

   XXV. And to this effect similarly is what follows. "Now at this present
   time not to have lands, and money, and houses, and brethren, with
   persecutions." For it is neither penniless, nor homeless, nor
   brotherless people that the Lord calls to life, since He has also
   called rich people; but, as we have said above, also brothers, as Peter
   with Andrew, and James with John the sons of Zebedee, but of one mind
   with each other and Christ. And the expression "with persecutions"
   rejects the possessing of each of those things. There is a persecution
   which arises from without, from men assailing the faithful, either out
   of hatred, or envy, or avarice, or through diabolic agency. But the
   most painful is internal persecution, which proceeds from each man's
   own soul being vexed by impious lusts, and diverse pleasures, and base
   hopes, and destructive dreams; when, always grasping at more, and
   maddened by brutish loves, and inflamed by the passions which beset it
   like goads and stings, it is covered with blood, (to drive it on) to
   insane pursuits, and to despair of life, and to contempt of God.

   More grievous and painful is this persecution, which arises from
   within, which is ever with a man, and which the persecuted cannot
   escape; for he carries the enemy about everywhere in himself. Thus also
   burning which attacks from without works trial, but that from within
   produces death. War also made on one is easily put an end to, but that
   which is in the soul continues till death.

   With such persecution, if you have worldly wealth, if you have brothers
   allied by blood and other pledges, abandon the whole wealth of these
   which leads to evil; procure peace for yourself, free yourself from
   protracted persecutions; turn from them to the Gospel; choose before
   all the Saviour and Advocate and Paraclete of your soul, the Prince of
   life. "For the things which are seen are temporary; but the things
   which are not seen are eternal." [3869] And in the present time are
   things evanescent and insecure, but in that to come is eternal life.

   XXVI. "The first shall be last, and the last first." [3870] This is
   fruitful in meaning and exposition, [3871] but does not demand
   investigation at present; for it refers not only to the wealthy alone,
   but plainly to all men, who have once surrendered themselves to faith.
   So let this stand aside for the present. But I think that our
   proposition has been demonstrated in no way inferior to what we
   promised, that the Saviour by no means has excluded the rich on account
   of wealth itself, and the possession of property, nor fenced off
   salvation against them; if they are able and willing to submit their
   life to God's commandments, and prefer them to transitory objects, and
   if they would look to the Lord with steady eye, as those who look for
   the nod of a good helmsman, what he wishes, what he orders, what he
   indicates, what signal he gives his mariners, where and whence he
   directs the ship's course. For what harm does one do, who, previous to
   faith, by applying his mind and by saving has collected a competency?
   Or what is much less reprehensible than this, if at once by God, who
   gave him his life, he has had his home given him in the house of such
   men, among wealthy people, powerful in substance, and pre-eminent in
   opulence? For if, in consequence of his involuntary birth in wealth, a
   man is banished from life, rather is he wronged by God, who created
   him, in having vouchsafed to him temporary enjoyment, and in being
   deprived of eternal life. And why should wealth have ever sprung from
   the earth at all, if it is the author and patron of death?

   But if one is able in the midst of wealth to turn from its power, and
   to entertain moderate sentiments, and to exercise self-command, and to
   seek God alone, and to breathe God and walk with God, such a poor man
   submits to the commandments, being free, unsubdued, free of disease,
   unwounded by wealth. But if not, "sooner shall a camel enter through a
   needle's eye, than such a rich man reach the kingdom of God." [3872]

   Let then the camel, going through a narrow and strait way before the
   rich man, signify something loftier; which mystery of the Saviour is to
   be learned in the "Exposition of first Principles and of Theology."
   [3873]

   XXVII. Well, first let the point of the parable, which is evident, and
   the reason why it is spoken, be presented. Let it teach the prosperous
   that they are not to neglect their own salvation, as if they had been
   already fore-doomed, nor, on the other hand, to cast wealth into the
   sea, or condemn it as a traitor and an enemy to life, but learn in what
   way and how to use wealth and obtain life. For since neither does one
   perish by any means by fearing because he is rich, nor is by any means
   saved by trusting and believing that he shall be saved, come let them
   look what hope the Saviour assigns them, and how what is unexpected may
   become ratified, and what is hoped for may come into possession.

   The Master accordingly, when asked, "Which is the greatest of the
   commandments?" says, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
   soul, and with all thy strength;" [3874] that no commandment is greater
   than this (He says), and with exceeding good reason; for it gives
   command respecting the First and the Greatest, God Himself, our Father,
   by whom all things were brought into being, and exist, and to whom what
   is saved returns again. By Him, then, being loved beforehand, and
   having received existence, it is impious for us to regard aught else
   older or more excellent; rendering only this small tribute of gratitude
   for the greatest benefits; and being unable to imagine anything else
   whatever by way of recompense to God, who needs nothing and is perfect;
   and gaining immortality by the very exercise of loving the Father to
   the extent of one's might and power. For the more one loves God, the
   more he enters within God.

   XXVIII. The second in order, and not any less than this, He says, is,
   "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself," [3875] consequently God
   above thyself. And on His interlocutor inquiring, "Who is my
   neighbour?" [3876] He did not, in the same way with the Jews, specify
   the blood-relation, or the fellow-citizen, or the proselyte, or him
   that had been similarly circumcised, or the man who uses one and the
   same law. But He introduces one on his way down from the upland region
   from Jerusalem to Jericho, and represents him stabbed by robbers, cast
   half-dead on the way, passed by the priest, looked sideways at by the
   Levite, but pitied by the vilified and excommunicated Samaritan; who
   did not, like those, pass casually, but came provided with such things
   as the man in danger required, such as oil, bandages, a beast of
   burden, money for the inn-keeper, part given now, and part promised.
   "Which," said He, "of them was neighbour to him that suffered these
   things?" and on his answering, "He that showed mercy to him,"
   (replied), [3877] Go thou also, therefore, and do likewise, since love
   buds into well-doing.

   XXIX. In both the commandments, then, He introduces love; but in order
   distinguishes it. And in the one He assigns to God the first part of
   love, and allots the second to our neighbour. Who else can it be but
   the Saviour Himself? or who more than He has pitied us, who by the
   rulers of darkness were all but put to death with many wounds, fears,
   lusts, passions, pains, deceits, pleasures? Of these wounds the only
   physician is Jesus, who cuts out the passions thoroughly by the
   root,--not as the law does the bare effects, the fruits of evil plants,
   but applies His axe to the roots of wickedness. He it is that poured
   wine on our wounded souls (the blood of David's vine), that brought the
   oil which flows from the compassions of the Father, [3878] and bestowed
   it copiously. He it is that produced the ligatures of health and of
   salvation that cannot be undone,--Love, Faith, Hope. He it is that
   subjected angels, and principalities, and powers, for a great reward to
   serve us. For they also shall be delivered from the vanity of the world
   through the revelation of the glory of the sons of God. We are
   therefore to love Him equally with God. And he loves Christ Jesus who
   does His will and keeps His commandments. "For not every one that saith
   unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he
   that doeth the will of My Father." [3879] And "Why call ye Me Lord,
   Lord, and do not the things which I say?" [3880] "And blessed are ye
   who see and hear what neither righteous men nor prophets" (have seen or
   heard), [3881] if ye do what I say.

   XXX. He then is first who loves Christ; and second, he who loves and
   cares for those who have believed on Him. For whatever is done to a
   disciple, the Lord accepts as done to Himself, and reckons the whole as
   His. "Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for
   you from the foundation of the world. For I was an hungered, and ye
   gave Me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me to drink: and I was a
   stranger, and ye took Me in: I was naked and ye clothed Me: I was sick,
   and ye visited Me: I was in prison, and ye came to Me. Then shall the
   righteous answer, saying, Lord, when saw we Thee hungry, and fed Thee?
   or thirsty, and gave Thee drink? And when saw we Thee a stranger, and
   took Thee in? or naked, and clothed Thee? Or when saw we Thee sick, and
   visited Thee? or in prison, and came to Thee? And the King answering,
   shall say to them, Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it
   unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me."

   Again, on the opposite side, to those who have not performed these
   things, "Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have not done it unto
   one of the least of these, ye have not done it to Me." [3882] And in
   another place, "He that receiveth you; receiveth Me; and he that
   receiveth not you, rejecteth Me." [3883]

   XXXI. Such He names children, and sons, and little children, and
   friends, and little ones here, in reference to their future greatness
   above. "Despise not," He says, "one of these little ones; for their
   angels always behold the face of My Father in heaven." [3884] And in
   another place, "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good
   pleasure to give you the kingdom of heaven." [3885] Similarly also He
   says that "the least in the kingdom of heaven" that is His own disciple
   "is greater than John, the greatest among those born of women." [3886]
   And again, "He that receiveth a righteous man or a prophet in the name
   of a righteous man or a prophet, shall receive their reward; and he
   that giveth to a disciple in the name of a disciple a cup of cold water
   to drink, shall not lose his reward." [3887] Wherefore this is the only
   reward that is not lost. And again, "Make to you friends of the mammon
   of unrighteousness, that, when ye fail, they may receive you into
   everlasting habitations;" [3888] showing that by nature all property
   which a man possesses in his own power is not his own. And from this
   unrighteousness it is permitted to work a righteous and saving thing,
   to refresh some one of those who have an everlasting habitation with
   the Father.

   See then, first, that He has not commanded you to be solicited or to
   wait to be importuned, but yourself to seek those who are to be
   benefited and are worthy disciples of the Saviour. Excellent,
   accordingly, also is the apostle's saying, "For the Lord loveth a
   cheerful giver;" [3889] who delights in giving, and spares not, sowing
   so that he may also thus reap, without murmuring, and disputing, and
   regret, and communicating, which is pure [3890] beneficence. But better
   than this is the saying spoken by the Lord in another place, "Give to
   every one that asketh thee." [3891] For truly such is God's delight in
   giving. And this saying is above all divinity, [3892] --not to wait to
   be asked, but to inquire oneself who deserves to receive kindness.

   XXXII. Then to appoint such a reward for liberality,--an everlasting
   habitation! O excellent trading! O divine merchandise! One purchases
   immortality for money; and, by giving the perishing things of the
   world, receives in exchange for these an eternal mansion in the
   heavens! Sail to this mart, if you are wise, O rich man! If need be,
   sail round the whole world. [3893] Spare not perils and toils, that you
   may purchase here the heavenly kingdom. Why do transparent stones and
   emeralds delight thee so much, and a house that is fuel for fire, or a
   plaything of time, or the sport of the earthquake, or an occasion for a
   tyrant's outrage? Aspire to dwell in the heavens, and to reign with
   God. This kingdom a man imitating God will give thee. By receiving a
   little here, there through all ages He will make thee a dweller with
   Him. Ask that you may receive; haste; strive; fear lest He disgrace
   thee. For He is not commanded to receive, but thou to give. The Lord
   did not say, Give, or bring, or do good, or help, but make a friend.
   But a friend proves himself such not by one gift, but by long intimacy.
   For it is neither the faith, nor the love, nor the hope, nor the
   endurance of one day, but "he that endureth to the end shall be saved."
   [3894]

   XXXIII. How then does man give these things? For I will give not only
   to friends, but to the friends of friends. And who is it that is the
   friend of God? Do not you judge who is worthy or who is unworthy. For
   it is possible you may be mistaken in your opinion. As in the
   uncertainty of ignorance it is better to do good to the undeserving for
   the sake of the deserving, than by guarding against those that are less
   good to fail to meet in with the good. For though sparing, and aiming
   at testing, who will receive meritoriously or not, it is possible for
   you to neglect some [3895] that are loved by God; the penalty for which
   is the punishment of eternal fire. But by offering to all in turn that
   need, you must of necessity by all means find some one of those who
   have power with God to save. "Judge not, then, that ye be not judged.
   With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again; [3896]
   good measure, pressed and shaken, and running over, shall be given to
   you." Open thy compassion to all who are enrolled the disciples of God;
   not looking contemptuously to personal appearance, nor carelessly
   disposed to any period of life. Nor if one appears penniless, or
   ragged, or ugly, or feeble, do thou fret in soul at this and turn away.
   This form is cast around us from without, the occasion of our entrance
   into this world, that we may be able to enter into this common school.
   But within dwells the hidden Father, and His Son, [3897] who died for
   us and rose with us.

   XXXIV. This visible appearance cheats death and the devil; for the
   wealth within, the beauty, is unseen by them. And they rave about the
   carcase, which they despise as weak, being blind to the wealth within;
   knowing not what a "treasure in an earthen vessel" [3898] we bear,
   protected as it is by the power of God the Father, and the blood of God
   the Son, [3899] and the dew of the Holy Spirit. But be not deceived,
   thou who hast tasted of the truth, and been reckoned worthy of the
   great redemption. But contrary to what is the case with the rest of
   men, collect for thyself an unarmed, an unwarlike, a bloodless, a
   passionless, a stainless host, pious old men, orphans dear to God,
   widows armed with meekness, men, adorned with love. Obtain with thy
   money such guards, for body and for soul, for whose sake a sinking ship
   is made buoyant, when steered by the prayers of the saints alone; and
   disease at its height is subdued, put to flight by the laying on of
   hands; and the attack of robbers is disarmed, spoiled by pious prayers;
   and the might of demons is crushed, put to shame in its operations by
   strenuous commands.

   XXXV. All these warriors and guards are trusty. No one is idle, no one
   is useless. One can obtain your pardon from God, another comfort you
   when sick, another weep and groan in sympathy for you to the Lord of
   all, another teach some of the things useful for salvation, another
   admonish with confidence, another counsel with kindness. And all can
   love truly, without guile, without fear, without hypocrisy, without
   flattery, without pretence. O sweet service of loving [souls]! O
   blessed thoughts of confident [hearts]! O sincere faith of those who
   fear God alone! O truth of words with those who cannot lie! O beauty of
   deeds with those who have been commissioned to serve God, to persuade
   God, to please God, not to touch thy flesh! to speak, but [3900] to the
   King of eternity dwelling in thee.

   XXXVI. All the faithful, then, are good and godlike, and worthy of the
   name by which they are encircled as with a diadem. There are, besides,
   some, the elect of the elect, and so much more or less distinguished by
   drawing themselves, like ships to the strand, out of the surge of the
   world and bringing themselves to safety; not wishing to seem holy, and
   ashamed if one call them so; hiding in the depth of their mind the
   ineffable mysteries, and disdaining to let their nobleness be seen in
   the world; whom the Word calls "the light of the world, and the salt of
   the earth." [3901] This is the seed, the image and likeness of God, and
   His true son and heir, sent here as it were on a sojourn, by the high
   administration and suitable arrangement of the Father, by whom the
   visible and invisible things of the world were created; some for their
   service, some for their discipline, some for their instruction; and all
   things are held together so long as the seed remains here; and when it
   is gathered, these things shall be very quickly dissolved.

   XXXVII. For what further need has God of the mysteries of love? [3902]
   And then thou shalt look into the bosom of the Father, whom God the
   only-begotten Son alone hath declared. And God Himself is love; and out
   of love to us became feminine. [3903] In His ineffable essence He is
   Father; in His compassion to us He became Mother. The Father by loving
   became feminine: and the great proof of this is He whom He begot of
   Himself; and the fruit brought forth by love is love.

   For this also He came down. For this He clothed Himself with man. For
   this He voluntarily subjected Himself to the experiences of men, that
   by bringing Himself to the measure of our weakness whom He loved, He
   might correspondingly bring us to the measure of His own strength. And
   about to be offered up and giving Himself a ransom, He left for us a
   new Covenant-testament: My love I give unto you. And what and how great
   is it? For each of us He gave His life,--the equivalent for all. This
   He demands from us in return for one another. And if we owe our lives
   to the brethren, and have made such a mutual compact with the Saviour,
   why should we any more hoard and shut up worldly goods, which are
   beggarly, foreign to us and transitory? Shall we shut up from each
   other what after a little shall be the property of the fire? Divinely
   and weightily John says, "He that loveth not his brother is a
   murderer," [3904] the seed of Cain, a nursling of the devil. He has not
   God's compassion. He has no hope of better things. He is sterile; he is
   barren; he is not a branch of the ever-living supercelestial vine. He
   is cut off; he waits the perpetual fire.

   XXXVIII. But learn thou the more excellent way, which Paul shows for
   salvation. "Love seeketh not her own," [3905] but is diffused on the
   brother. About him she is fluttered, about him she is soberly insane.
   "Love covers a multitude of sins." [3906] "Perfect love casteth out
   fear." [3907] "Vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up; rejoiceth not in
   iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all
   things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Love never faileth.
   Prophecies are done away, tongues cease, gifts of healing fail on the
   earth. But these three abide, Faith, Hope, Love. But the greatest of
   these is Love." [3908] And rightly. For Faith departs when we are
   convinced by vision, by seeing God. And Hope vanishes when the things
   hoped for come. But Love comes to completion, and grows more when that
   which is perfect has been bestowed. If one introduces it into his soul,
   although he be born in sins, and has done many forbidden things, he is
   able, by increasing love, and adopting a pure repentance, to retrieve
   his mistakes. For let not this be left to despondency and despair by
   you, if you learn who the rich man is that has not a place in heaven,
   and what way he uses his property.

   XXXIX. If one should escape the superfluity of riches, and the
   difficulty they interpose in the way of life, and be able to enjoy the
   eternal good things; but should happen, either from ignorance or
   involuntary circumstances, after the seal [3909] and redemption, to
   fall into sins or transgressions so as to be quite carried away; such a
   man is entirely rejected by God. For to every one who has turned to God
   in truth, and with his whole heart, the doors are open, and the
   thrice-glad Father receives His truly repentant son. And true
   repentance is to be no longer bound in the same sins for which He
   denounced death against Himself, but to eradicate them completely from
   the soul. For on their extirpation God takes up His abode again in
   thee. For it is said there is great and exceeding joy and festival in
   the heavens with the Father and the angels when one sinner turns and
   repents. [3910] Wherefore also He cries, "I will have mercy, and not
   sacrifice." [3911] "I desire not the death, but the repentance of the
   sinner." [3912] "Though your sins be as scarlet wool, I will make them
   white as snow; though they be blacker than darkness, I will wash and
   make them like white wool." [3913] For it is in the power of God alone
   to grant the forgiveness of sins, and not to impute transgressions;
   since also the Lord commands us each day to forgive the repenting
   brethren. [3914] "And if we, being evil, know to give good gifts,"
   [3915] much more is it the nature of the Father of mercies, the good
   Father of all consolation, much pitying, very merciful, to be
   long-suffering, to wait for those who have turned. And to turn is
   really to cease from our sins, and to look no longer behind.

   XL. Forgiveness of past sins, then, God gives; but of future, each one
   gives to himself. And this is to repent, to condemn the past deeds, and
   beg oblivion of them from the Father, who only of all is able to undo
   what is done, by mercy proceeding from Him, and to blot out former sins
   by the dew of the Spirit. "For by the state in which I find you will I
   judge," [3916] also, is what in each case the end of all cries aloud.
   So that even in the case of one who has done the greatest good deeds in
   his life, but at the end has run headlong into wickedness, all his
   former pains are profitless [3917] to him, since at the catastrophe of
   the drama he has given up his part; while it is possible for the man
   who formerly led a bad and dissolute life, on afterwards repenting, to
   overcome in the time after repentance the evil conduct of a long time.
   But it needs great carefulness, just as bodies that have suffered by
   protracted disease need regimen and special attention. Thief, dost thou
   wish to get forgiveness? steal no more. Adulterer, burn no more.
   Fornicator, live for the future chastely. Thou who hast robbed, give
   back, and give back more than [thou tookest]. False witness, practice
   truth. Perjurer, swear no more, and extirpate the rest of the passions,
   wrath, lust, grief, fear; that thou mayest be found at the end to have
   previously in this world been reconciled to the adversary. It is then
   probably impossible all at once to eradicate inbred passions; but by
   God's power and human intercession, and the help of brethren, and
   sincere repentance, and constant care, they are corrected.

   XLI. Wherefore it is by all means necessary for thee, who art pompous,
   and powerful, and rich, to set over thyself some man of God as a
   trainer and governor. Reverence, though it be but one man; fear, though
   it be but one man. Give yourself to hearing, though it be but one
   speaking freely, using harshness, and at the same time healing. For it
   is good for the eyes not to continue always wanton, but to weep and
   smart sometimes, for greater health. So also nothing is more pernicious
   to the soul than uninterrupted pleasure. For it is blinded by melting
   away, if it remain unmoved by bold speech. Fear this man when angry; be
   pained at his groaning; and reverence him when making his anger to
   cease; and anticipate him when he is deprecating punishment. Let him
   pass many sleepless nights for thee, interceding for thee with God,
   influencing the Father with the magic of familiar litanies. For He does
   not hold out against His children when they beg His pity. And for you
   he will pray purely, held in high honour as an angel of God, and
   grieved not by you, but for you. This is sincere repentance. "God is
   not mocked," [3918] nor does He give heed to vain words. For He alone
   searches the marrow and reins of the heart, and hears those that are in
   the fire, and listens to those who supplicate in the whale's belly; and
   is near to all who believe, and far from the ungodly if they repent
   not.

   XLII. And that you may be still more confident, that repenting thus
   truly there remains for you a sure hope of salvation, listen to a tale,
   [3919] which is not a tale but a narrative, [3920] handed down and
   committed to the custody of memory, about the Apostle John. For when,
   on the tyrant's death, he returned to Ephesus from the isle of Patmos,
   he went away, being invited, to the contiguous territories of the
   nations, here to appoint bishops, there to set in order whole Churches,
   there to ordain such as were marked out by the Spirit.

   Having come to one of the cities not far off (the name of which some
   give [3921] ), and having put the brethren to rest in other matters, at
   last, looking to the bishop appointed, and seeing a youth, powerful in
   body, comely in appearance, and ardent, said, "This (youth) I commit to
   you in all earnestness, in the presence of the Church, and with Christ
   as witness." And on his accepting and promising all, he gave the same
   injunction and testimony. And he set out for Ephesus. And the presbyter
   taking home the youth committed to him, reared, kept, cherished, and
   finally baptized him. After this he relaxed his stricter care and
   guardianship, under the idea that the seal of the Lord he had set on
   him was a complete protection to him. But on his obtaining premature
   freedom, some youths of his age, idle, dissolute, and adepts in evil
   courses, corrupt him. First they entice him by many costly
   entertainments; then afterwards by night issuing forth for highway
   robbery, they take him along with them. Then they dared to execute
   together something greater. And he by degrees got accustomed; and from
   greatness of nature, when he had gone aside from the right path, and
   like a hard-mouthed and powerful horse, had taken the bit between his
   teeth, rushed with all the more force down into the depths. And having
   entirely despaired of salvation in God, he no longer meditated what was
   insignificant, but having perpetrated some great exploit, now that he
   was once lost, he made up his mind to a like fate with the rest. Taking
   them and forming a band of robbers, he was the prompt captain of the
   bandits, the fiercest, the bloodiest, the cruelest.

   Time passed, and some necessity having emerged, they send again for
   John. He, when he had settled the other matters on account of which he
   came, said, "Come now, O bishop, restore to us the deposit which I and
   the Saviour committed to thee in the face of the Church over which you
   preside, as witness." The other was at first confounded, thinking that
   it was a false charge about money which he did not get; and he could
   neither believe the allegation regarding what he had not, nor
   disbelieve John. But when he said "I demand the young man, and the soul
   of the brother," the old man, groaning deeply, and bursting into tears,
   said, "He is dead." "How and what kind of death?" "He is dead," he
   said, "to God. For he turned wicked and abandoned, and at last a
   robber; and now he has taken possession of the mountain in front of the
   church, along with a band like him." Rending, therefore, his clothes,
   and striking his head with great lamentation, the apostle said, "It was
   a fine guard of a brother's soul I left! But let a horse be brought me,
   and let some one be my guide on the way." He rode away, just as he was,
   straight from the church. On coming to the place, he is arrested by the
   robbers' outpost; neither fleeing nor entreating, but crying, "It was
   for this I came. Lead me to your captain;" who meanwhile was waiting,
   all armed as he was. But when he recognized John as he advanced, he
   turned, ashamed, to flight. The other followed with all his might,
   forgetting his age, crying, "Why, my son, dost thou flee from me, thy
   father, unarmed, old? Son, pity me. Fear not; thou hast still hope of
   life. I will give account to Christ for thee. If need be, I will
   willingly endure thy death, as the Lord did death for us. For thee I
   will surrender my life. Stand, believe; Christ hath sent me."

   And he, when he heard, first stood, looking down; then threw down his
   arms, then trembled and wept bitterly. And on the old man approaching,
   he embraced him, speaking for himself with lamentations as he could,
   and baptized a second time with tears, concealing only his right hand.
   The other pledging, and assuring him on oath that he would find
   forgiveness for himself from the Saviour, beseeching and falling on his
   knees, and kissing his right hand itself, as now purified by
   repentance, led him back to the church. Then by supplicating with
   copious prayers, and striving along with him in continual fastings, and
   subduing his mind by various utterances [3922] of words, did not
   depart, as they say, till he restored him to the Church, presenting in
   him a great example of true repentance and a great token of
   regeneration, a trophy of the resurrection for which we hope; when at
   the end of the world, the angels, radiant with joy, hymning and opening
   the heavens, shall receive into the celestial abodes those who truly
   repent; and before all, the Saviour Himself goes to meet them,
   welcoming them; holding forth the shadowless, ceaseless light;
   conducting them, to the Father's bosom, to eternal life, to the kingdom
   of heaven.

   Let one believe these things, and the disciples of God, and God, who is
   surety, the Prophecies, the Gospels, the Apostolic words; living in
   accordance with them, and lending his ears, and practising the deeds,
   he shall at his decease see the end and demonstration of the truths
   taught. For he who in this world welcomes the angel of penitence will
   not repent at the time that he leaves the body, nor be ashamed when he
   sees the Saviour approaching in His glory and with His army. He fears
   not the fire.

   But if one chooses to continue and to sin perpetually in pleasures, and
   values indulgence here above eternal life, and turns away from the
   Saviour, who gives forgiveness; let him no more blame either God, or
   riches, or his having fallen, but his own soul, which voluntarily
   perishes. But to him who directs his eye to salvation and desires it,
   and asks with boldness and vehemence for its bestowal, the good Father
   who is in heaven will give the true purification and the changeless
   life. To whom, by His Son Jesus Christ, the Lord of the living and
   dead, and by the Holy Spirit, be glory, honour, power, eternal majesty,
   both now and ever, from generation to generation, and from eternity to
   eternity. Amen.

  Elucidations

      I.

   ([137]Note 1, p. 591.)

   The kingdom of Christ was set up in great weakness, that nothing might
   be wanting to the glory of His working by the Spirit, in its triumph
   over the darkness of the world. "Not many wise men after the flesh, not
   many mighty, not many noble," were called. [3923] And so it continued
   for a long time. Under Commodus, however (a.d. 180-192), a temporary
   respite was conceded; partly because his favourite Marcia took their
   part for some reason, and partly because his cruelty gratified itself
   in another direction. "Our circumstances," says Eusebius, "were changed
   to a milder aspect; as there was peace prevailing, by the grace of God,
   throughout the world in the churches. Then, also, the saving-doctrine
   brought the minds of men to a devout veneration of the Supreme God,
   from every race on earth, so that, now, many of those eminent at Rome
   for their wealth and kindred, with their whole house and family,
   yielded themselves to salvation." What happened near the court of a
   fickle tyrant was far more likely to be common in Antioch and
   Alexandria. Men's consciences had no doubt been with the Christians, as
   Pilate's was with their Master; and now, when it became less perilous,
   they began to laugh at idols, and even to enroll themselves with
   Christians. Some, no doubt, like Joseph and Nicodemus, gave themselves
   to the Lord; but others, "with a form of godliness, denied the power
   thereof." Clement detected the great evil that began to threaten, and
   this beautiful tract is the product of his watchful observation. For he
   was gifted, also, with that great characteristic of noble mind, a
   faculty of foreseeing "whereunto such things must grow." His love and
   solicitude for the Church, lest its simplicity should pass away with
   its poverty, dictated this solemn and most timely warning.

   And it is worthy of grateful remark, how admirably sustained was this
   primitive spirit among all the early witnesses for truth. They were not
   of this world, and they dreaded its influence. How richly the Word
   dwelt in them, is manifest from their amazing familiarity with the
   Scriptures. That they sometimes misquote or confuse quotations, or mix
   a Scriptural saying with some current proverb or an apocryphal gloss,
   is surely not surprising, when copies of the Scriptures were few and
   costly, when no concordances and books of reference were at hand, and
   when their whole apparatus for Biblical study was so extremely
   incomplete.

   To the genius of this great Alexandrian Father, we are all debtors to
   this day. Had he not, unfortunately, allied much of his wisdom with the
   hateful name of the Gnostic, [3924] which he failed to wrest from the
   pseudo-Gnostics, with whom it is irrevocably associated, we may be sure
   his expositions of Christian philosophy would be more useful in our
   times.

      II.

   (Segaar, [138]note 3, p. 594.)

   Charles Segaar, S.T.D., born in 1724, was Greek professor at Utrecht,
   from 1766 to 1803, after filling several important and laborious
   positions as a pastor and preacher. He died Dec. 22, 1803. He has left
   a great reputation as "the most theological of philologists, and the
   most philological of theologians." Had he gone over the entire text of
   Clement, and edited all his works, with the care and ability displayed
   in his critical edition of the Tis ho sozomenos plousios, the world
   would have been greatly enriched by his influence on the cultivation of
   patristic literature. In his eloquent preface to this tract, he bewails
   the neglect into which that fundamental department of Christian
   learning had fallen; praising the labours of Anglican scholars, who, in
   the former century, had devoted themselves to the production of
   valuable editions of the Fathers. He speaks of himself as from early
   years inflamed with a singular love of such studies and especially of
   the Greek Fathers, and adds an expression of the extreme gratification
   with which he had read and pondered the Quis dives Salvandus, among the
   admirable works of Clement of Alexandria. He corrects Ghisler's error
   in crediting it to Origen (edition of 1623), and reminds us that there
   is but a single ms. from which it is derived, viz., that of the
   Vatican.

   Apart from the value of Segaar's annotations, his work is very useful
   to Greek scholars, for its varied erudition, much wealth of his
   learning being expended upon single words and their idiomatic uses. The
   sort of work devoted to this tract is precisely what I covet for my
   countrymen; and I look forward with hope to the day as not remote, when
   from regions now unnamed, in this vast domain of our republican
   America, critical editions of all of the Ante-Nicene Fathers shall be
   given to the republic of letters, with a beauty of typography hitherto
   unknown. The valuable Patrologia of Migne might well be made the base
   of a Phoenix-like edition of the same series. It was only fit for such
   a base; for its print and paper are disgraceful, and the inaccuracy and
   carelessness of its references and editorial work are only pardonable
   when one reflects on the small cost at which it was afforded. The
   plates have perished in flames; but the restoration of the whole work
   is worthy of the ambition of American scholars, and of the patronage of
   wealth now sordid but capable of being ennobled by being made useful to
   mankind.

      III.

   (Willing Souls, cap. xxi. [139]p. 597.)

   On the subject of free-will, so profusely illustrated by Clement, I
   have foreborne to add any comments. But Segaar's Excursus (iv. p. 410)
   is worthy of being consulted. On Clement's ideas of Hades and the
   intermediate state, I have made no comment; but Segaar's endeavour to
   state judicially the view of our author (Excursus, x. p. 421), though
   in some particulars it seems to me unsatisfactory, is also worthy of
   examination.

   If a number of other important points have been apparently overlooked
   in my Elucidations, it is because I fear I have already gone beyond the
   conditions and limitations of my work.

   [3924] For Gnostic, Intellector is used, p. 577. Why not use the Latin
   word Perfector? The idea is not simply perfectus: Clement's Gnostic is
   a gnomon, actively indexing the mind of Christ.

   [3838] [The solemn words of our Lord about the perils of wealth and
   "the deceitfulness of riches" are much insisted on by Hermas,
   especially in the beautiful opening of the Similitudes (book iii.); and
   it seems remarkable, that, even in the age of martyrs and confessors,
   such warnings should have seemed needful. Clement is deeply impressed
   with the duty of enforcing such doctrine; and perhaps the germ of this
   very interesting essay is to be found in that eloquent passage in his
   Stromata (book ii. cap. 5, pp. [140]351, [141]352), to which the reader
   may do well to recur, using it as a preface to the following pages.

   [3850] Luke x. 41, 42.

   [3851] The application of the words he kaine ktisis to Christ has been
   much discussed. Segaar has a long note on it, the purport of which he
   thus sums up: he kaine ktisis is a creature to whom nothing has ever
   existed on earth equal or like, man but also God, through whom is true
   light and everlasting life. [The translator has largely availed himself
