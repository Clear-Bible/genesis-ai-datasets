                                Prefatory note.

   The circumstances in which this Exposition of Psalm cxxx. originated
   are peculiarly interesting. Dr Owen himself, in a statement made to Mr
   Richard Davis, who ultimately became pastor of a church in Rowel,
   Northamptonshire, explains the occasion which led him to a very careful
   examination of the fourth verse in the psalm. Mr Davis, being under
   religious impressions, had sought a conference with Owen. In the course
   of the conversation, Dr Owen put the question, "Young man, pray in what
   manner do you think to go to God?" "Through the Mediator, sir,"
   answered Mr Davis." That is easily said," replied the Doctor, "but I
   assure you it is another thing to go to God through the Mediator than
   many who make use of the expression are aware of. I myself preached
   Christ," he continued, "some years, when I had but very little, if any,
   experimental acquaintance with access to God through Christ; until the
   Lord was pleased to visit me with sore affliction, whereby I was
   brought to the mouth of the grave, and under which my soul was
   oppressed with horror and darkness; but God graciously relieved my
   spirit by a powerful application of Psalm cxxx. 4, But there is
   forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared;' from whence I
   received special instruction, peace, and comfort, in drawing near to
   God through the Mediator, and preached thereupon immediately after my
   recovery." The incident to which he refers had occurred at an early
   period in his public life; and it is probable this Exposition is the
   substance of the discourses which he preached on his recovery from
   affliction, under the influence of enlivened faith in the mediation of
   Christ. We cannot wonder that the particular verse which had proved to
   Owen a spring of refreshment in a weary place, should receive prominent
   and prolonged consideration in this work. The exposition of it
   constitutes nearly three-fourths of the whole treatise. These facts,
   moreover, account for its prevailing character. It is hardly a specimen
   of pure commentary, so much as a series of discourses, with the verses
   of the psalm, and more especially the fourth verse, as the texts
   selected. The charge of prolixity and diffuseness, urged against this
   work, applies only if it be tried by the rules according to which we
   estimate the merits of a commentary. There are, for example, thirteen
   separate facts and arguments, illustrative of the great doctrine that
   there is forgiveness with God, each opening up very precious mines of
   thought and inquiry, but all of them out of place, at least in the
   length to which they extend, if viewed simply as the exposition of a
   verse. The reader bent on his own edification, rather than on judging
   of the work by the standard of a very rigid criticism, not unthankful
   for what of commentary proper it contains, will be happy that the
   author took a course leaving him free to indulge in that teeming
   opulence of evangelical illustration, and frequency of awakening
   appeals, which impart a distinctive character and peculiar interest to
   the work.

   The original imprimatur of the volume bears date 1668; and such,
   according to all authorities, was the year in which it first appeared.
   We have seen an edition printed in 1669, and another printed in 1680.
   The latter must correspond with, and must have been printed from the
   first edition, for it contains some sentences quite obscure and
   incomplete, which are corrected in the edition of 1669. It is singular,
   also, that every modern reprint should embody the inaccuracies of the
   first edition. -- Ed.

                                 To the reader.

   Christian Reader,

   The ensuing exposition and discourses are intended for the benefit of
   those whose spiritual state and condition is represented in the psalm
   here explained. That these are not a few, that they are many, yea, that
   to some part or parts of it they are all who believe, both the
   Scriptures and their own experience will bear testimony. Some of them,
   it may be, will inquire into and after their own concernments, as they
   are here declared. To be serviceable to their faith, peace, and
   spiritual consolation hath been the whole of my design. If they meet
   with any discovery of truth, any due application of it to their
   consciences, any declaration of the sense and mind of the Holy Ghost in
   the Scriptures, suitable unto their condition and useful to their
   edification, much of my end and purpose is obtained.

   I know some there are that dislike all discourses of this nature, and
   look upon them with contempt and scorn; but why they should so do I
   know not, unless the gospel itself, and all the mysteries of it, be
   folly unto them. Sin and grace in their original causes, various
   respects, consequents, and ends, are the principal subjects of the
   whole Scripture, of the whole revelation of the will of God to mankind.
   In these do our present and eternal concernments lie, and from and by
   them hath God designed the great and everlasting exaltation of his own
   glory. Upon these do turn all the transactions that are between God and
   the souls of men. That it should be an endeavour needless or
   superfluous, to inquire into the will of God about, and our own
   interest in, these things, who can imagine? Two ways there are whereby
   this may be done, -- first, speculatively, by a due investigation of
   the nature of these things, according as their doctrine is declared in
   the Scripture. An endeavour according to the mind of God herein is just
   and commendable, and comprehensive of most of the chief heads of
   divinity. But this is not to be engaged in for its own sake. The
   knowledge of God and spiritual things has this proportion unto
   practical sciences, that the end of all its notions and doctrines
   consists in practice. Wherefore, secondly, these things are to be
   considered practically; that is, as the souls and consciences of men
   are actually concerned in them and conversant about them. How men
   contract the guilt of sin, what sense they have and ought to have
   thereof, what danger they are liable unto thereon, what perplexities
   and distresses their souls and consciences are reduced to thereby, what
   courses they fix upon for their relief; as also, what is that grace of
   God whereby alone they may be delivered, wherein it consists, how it
   was prepared, how purchased, how it is proposed, and how it may be
   attained; what effects and consequents a participation of it doth
   produce; how in these things faith and obedience unto God, dependence
   on him, submission to him, waiting for him, are to be exercised, -- is
   the principal work that those who are called unto the dispensation of
   the gospel ought to inquire into themselves, and to acquaint others
   withal. In the right and due management of these things, whether by
   writing or oral instruction, with prudence, diligence, and zeal, doth
   consist their principal uesfulness in reference unto the glory of God
   and the everlasting welfare of the souls of men. And they are under a
   great mistake who suppose it an easy and a common matter to treat of
   these practical things usefully, to the edification of them that do
   believe; because both the nature of the things themselves, with the
   concerns of the souls and consciences of all sorts of persons in them,
   require that they be handled plainly, and without those intermixtures
   of secular learning and additions of ornaments of speech which
   discourses of other natures may or ought to be composed and set off
   withal. Some, judging by mere outward appearances, -- especially if
   they be of them from whom the true nature of the things themselves
   treated of are hid, -- are ready to despise and scorn the plain
   management of them, as that which hath nothing of wisdom or learning
   accompanying of it, no effects of any commendable ability of mind for
   which it should be esteemed. But it is not expressible how great a
   mistake such persons, through their own darkness and ignorance, do
   labour under. In a right spiritual understanding, in a due perception
   and comprehension of these things, -- the things of the sins of men and
   grace of God, -- consists the greatest part of that wisdom, of that
   soundness of mind, of that knowledge rightly so called, which the
   gospel commands, exhibits, and puts a valuation upon. To reveal and
   declare them unto others in words of truth and soberness fit and meet;
   to express them unto the understandings of men opened and enlightened
   by the same Spirit by whom the things themselves are originally
   revealed; to derive such sacred spiritual truths from the word, and by
   a due preparation to communicate and apply them to the souls and
   consciences of men, -- contains a principal part of that ministerial
   skill and ability which are required in the dispensers of the gospel,
   and wherein a severe exercise of sound learning, judgment, and care, is
   necessary to be found, and may be fully expressed.

   Into this treasury, towards the service of the house of God, it is that
   I have east my mite in the ensuing exposition and discourses on the
   130th Psalm. The design of the Holy Ghost was therein to express and
   represent, in the person and condition of the psalmist, the case of a
   soul entangled and ready to be overwhelmed with the guilt of sin,
   relieved by a discovery of grace and forgiveness in God, with its
   deportment upon a participation of that relief. After the exposition of
   the words of the text, my design and endeavour hath been only to
   enlarge the portraiture here given us in the psalm of a believing soul
   in and under the condition mentioned; to render the lines of it more
   visible, and to make the character given in its description more
   legible; and withal, to give unto others in the like condition with the
   psalmist a light to understand and discern themselves in that image and
   representation which is here made of them in the person of another. To
   this end have I been forced to enlarge on the two great heads of sin
   and grace, -- especially on the latter, here called the "forgiveness
   that is with God." An interest herein, a participation hereof, being
   our principal concernment in this world, and the sole foundation of all
   our expectations of a blessed portion in that which is to come, it
   certainly requires the best and utmost of our endeavours, as to look
   into the nature, causes, and effects of it, so especially into the ways
   and means whereby we may be made partakers of it, and how that
   participation may be secured unto us unto our peace and consolation; as
   also into that love, that holiness, that obedience, that fruitfulness
   in good works, which, on the account of this grace, God expecteth from
   us and requireth at our hands. An explication of these things is that
   which I have designed to ensue and follow after in these discourses,
   and that with a constant eye, as on the one hand to the sole rule and
   standard of truth, the sacred Scriptures, especially that part of it
   which is under peculiar consideration; so, on the other, to the
   experience and service unto the edification of them that do believe,
   whose spiritual benefit and advantage, without any other consideration
   in the world, is aimed at in the publishing of them.

   An

   Exposition upon Psalm CXXX.
     __________________________________________________________________


   Verse 1. Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.

   2. Lord, hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my
   supplications.

   3. If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand

   4. But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.

   5. I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.

   6. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
   morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

   7. Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and
   with him is plenteous redemption.

   8. And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
     __________________________________________________________________

A paraphrase.

   Verses 1, 2. -- O Lord, through my manifold sins and provocations, I
   have brought myself into great distresses. Mine iniquities are always
   before me, and I am ready to be overwhelmed with them, as with a flood
   of waters; for they have brought me into depths, wherein I am ready to
   be swallowed up. But yet, although my distress be great and perplexing,
   I do not, I dare not, utterly despond and cast away all hopes of relief
   or recovery. Nor do I seek unto any other remedy, way, or means of
   relief; but I apply myself to thee, Jehovah, to thee alone. And in this
   my application unto thee, the greatness and urgency of my troubles
   makes my soul urgent, earnest, and pressing in my supplications. Whilst
   I have no rest, I can give thee no rest. Oh, therefore, attend and
   hearken unto the voice of my crying and supplications!

   Verse 3. -- It is true, O Lord, thou God great and terrible, that if
   thou shouldst deal with me in this condition, with any man living, with
   the best of thy saints, according to the strict and exact tenor of the
   law, which first represents itself to my guilty conscience and troubled
   soul; if thou shouldst take notice of, observe, and keep in
   remembrance, mine, or their, or the iniquity of any one, to the end
   that thou mightst deal with them, and recompense unto them according to
   the sentence thereof, there would be, neither for me nor them, any the
   least expectation of deliverance. All flesh must fail before thee, and
   the spirits which thou hast made, and that to eternity; for who could
   stand before thee when thou shouldst so execute thy displeasure?

   Verse 4. -- But, O Lord, this is not absolutely and universally the
   state of things between thy Majesty and poor sinners; thou art in thy
   nature infinitely good and gracious, ready and free in the purposes of
   thy will to receive them. And there is such a blessed way made for the
   exercise of the holy inclinations and purposes of thy heart towards
   them, in the mediation and blood of thy dear Son, that they have
   assured foundations of concluding and believing that there is pardon
   and forgiveness with thee for them, and which, in the way of thine
   appointments, they may be partakers of. This way, therefore, will I,
   with all that fear thee, persist in. I will not give over, leave thee,
   or turn from thee, through my fears, discouragements, and
   despondencies; but will abide constantly in the observation of the
   worship which thou hast prescribed, and the performance of the
   obedience which thou dost require, having great encouragements so to
   do.

   Verse 5. -- And herein, upon the account of the forgiveness that is
   with thee, O Lord, do I wait with all patience, quietness, and
   perseverance. In this work is my whole soul engaged, even in an earnest
   expectation of thy approach unto me in a way of grace and mercy. And
   for my encouragement therein hast thou given out unto me a blessed word
   of grace, a faithful word of promise, whereon my hope is fixed.

   Verse 6. -- Yea, in the performance and discharge of this duty, my soul
   is intent upon thee, and in its whole frame turned towards thee, and
   that with such diligence and watchfulness in looking out after every
   way and means of thy appearance, of the manifestation of thyself, and
   coming unto me, that I excel therein those who, with longing desire,
   heedfulness, and earnest expectation, do wait and watch for the
   appearance of the morning; and that either that they may rest from
   their night watches, or have light for the duties of thy worship in the
   temple, which they are most delighted in.

   Verses 7, 8. -- Herein have I found that rest, peace, and satisfaction
   unto my own soul, that I cannot but invite and encourage others in the
   like condition to take the same course with me. Let, then, all the
   Israel of God, all that fear him, learn this of me, and from my
   experience. Be not hasty in your distresses, despond not, despair not,
   turn not aside unto other remedies; but hope in the Lord: for I can
   now, in an especial manner, give testimony unto this, that there is
   mercy with him suited unto your relief. Yea, whatever your distress be,
   the redemption that is with him is so bounteous, plenteous, and
   unsearchable, that the undoubted issue of your performance of this duty
   will be, that you shall be delivered from the guilt of all your sins
   and the perplexities of all your troubles.

General scope of the whole Psalm.

   The design of the Holy Ghost in this psalm is to express, in the
   experience of the psalmist and the working of his faith, the state and
   condition of a soul greatly in itself perplexed, relieved on the
   account of grace, and acting itself towards God and his saints suitably
   to the discovery of that grace unto him; -- a great design, and full of
   great instruction.

   And this general prospect gives us the parts and scope of the whole
   psalm; for we have, --

   I. The state and condition of the soul therein represented, with his
   deportment in and under that state and condition, in verses 1, 2:--

   "Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice;
   let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications."

   II. His inquiry after relief. And therein are two things that present
   themselves unto him; the one whereof, which first offers the
   consideration of itself to him in his distress, he deprecates, verse
   3:--

   "If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"

   The other he closeth withal, and finds relief in it and supportment by
   it, verse 4:--

   "But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest he feared."

   Upon this, his discovery and fixing on relief, there is the acting of
   his faith and the deportment of his whole person:--

   1. Towards God, verses 5, 6:--

   "I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My
   soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I
   say, more than they that watch for the morning."

   2. Towards the saints, verses 7, 8:--

   "Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and
   with him is plenteous redemption. And he shall redeem Israel from all
   his iniquities."

   All which parts, and the various concernments of them, must be opened
   severally.

   And this also gives an account of what is my design from and upon the
   words of this psalm, -- namely, to declare the perplexed entanglements
   which may befall a gracious soul, such a one as this psalmist was, with
   the nature and proper workings of faith in such a condition;
   principally aiming at what it is that gives a soul relief and
   supportment in, and afterward deliverance from, such a perplexed
   estate.

   The Lord in mercy dispose of these meditations in such a way and manner
   as that both he that writes and they that read may be made partakers of
   the benefit, relief, and consolation intended for his saints in this
   psalm by the Holy Ghost!
     __________________________________________________________________

                            Verses first and second.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The state and condition of the soul represented in the psalm -- The two
   first verses opened.

   The state and condition of the soul here represented as the basis on
   which the process of the psalm is built, with its deportment, or the
   general acting of its faith in that state, is expressed in the two
   first verses:--

   "Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord. Lord, hear my voice:
   let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications."

   I. The present state of the soul under consideration is included in
   that expression, "Out of the depths."

   Some of the ancients, as Chrysostom, suppose this expression to relate
   unto the depths of the heart of the psalmist: Ti estin ek batheonÂ· not
   from the mouth or tongue only, all' apo kardias bathutates, -- "but
   from the depth and bottom of the heart;" ex auton tes dianoias ton
   bathron, "from the deepest recesses of the mind."

   And, indeed, the word is used to express the depths of the hearts of
   men, but utterly in another sense: Ps. lxiv. 6, "The heart is deep."

   But the obvious sense of the place, and the constant use of the word,
   will not admit of this interpretation: "E profundis;" from mq?,
   "profundus fuit," is mmqym? in the plural number, "profunditates," or
   "depths." It is commonly used for valleys, or any deep places whatever,
   but especially of waters. Valleys and deep places, because of their
   darkness and solitariness, are accounted places of horror,
   helplessness, and trouble: Ps. xxiii. 4, "Though I walk through the
   valley of the shadow of death;" that is, in the extremity of danger and
   trouble.

   The moral use of the word, as expressing the state and condition of the
   souls of men, is metaphorical. These depths, then, are difficulties or
   pressures, attended with fear, horror, danger, and trouble.

   And they are of two sorts:--

   1. Providential, in respect of outward distresses, calamities, and
   afflictions: Ps. lxix. 1, 2, "Save me, O God; for the waters axe come
   in unto my soul. I stick in the mire of the deep, and there is no
   standing. I am come, vmmqymym?, into the depths of waters, and the
   flood overflows me." It is trouble, and the extremity of it, that the
   psalmist complains of, and which he thus expresseth. He was brought by
   it into a condition like unto a man ready to be drowned, being cast
   into the bottom of deep and miry waters, where be had no firm
   foundation to stand upon, nor ability to come out; as he farther
   explains himself, verse 15.

   2. There are internal depths, -- depths of conscience upon the account
   of sin: Ps. lxxxviii. 6, "Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in
   darkness, in the deeps." What he intends by this expression, the
   psalmist declares in the next words, verse 7, "Thy wrath lieth hard
   upon me." Sense of God's wrath upon his conscience upon the account of
   sin, was the deep he was east into. So, verse 15, speaking of the same
   matter, saith he, "I suffer thy terrors;" and verse 16, "Thy fierce
   wrath goeth over me;" which he calls water, waves, and deeps, according
   to the metaphor before opened.

   And these are the deeps that are here principally intended. "Clamat sub
   molibus et fluctibus iniquitatem suarum," says Austin on the place; --
   "He cries out under the weight and waves of his sins."

   This the ensuing psalm makes evident. Desiring to be delivered from
   these depths out of which he cried, he deals with God wholly about
   mercy and forgiveness; and it is sin done from which forgiveness is a
   deliverance. The doctrine, also, that he preacheth upon his delivery is
   that of mercy, grace, and redemption, as is manifest from the close of
   the psalm; and what we have deliverance by is most upon our hearts when
   we are delivered.

   It is true, indeed, that these deeps do oftentimes concur; as David
   speaks, "Deep calleth unto deep," Ps. xlii. 7. The deeps of affliction
   awaken the conscience to a deep sense of sin. But sin is the disease,
   affliction only a symptom of it: and in attending a cure, the disease
   itself is principally to be heeded; the symptom will follow or depart
   of itself.

   Many interpreters think that this was now David's condition. By great
   trouble and distress he was greatly minded of sin; and we must not,
   therefore, wholly pass over that intendment of the word, though we are
   chiefly to respect that which he himself, in this address unto God, did
   principally regard.

   This, in general, is the state and condition of the soul managed in
   this psalm, and is as the key to the ensuing discourse, or the hinge on
   which it turns. As to my intendment from the psalm, that which ariseth
   from hence may be comprised in these two propositions:--

   1. Gracious souls, after much communion with God, may be brought into
   inextricable depths and entanglements on the account of sin; for such
   the psalmist here expresseth his own condition to have been, and such
   he was,

   2. The inward root of outward distresses is principally to be attended
   in all pressing trials; -- sin, in afflictions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Gracious souls may be brought into depths on the account of sin -- What
   those depths are.

   Before I proceed at all in the farther opening of the words, they
   having all of them respect unto the proposition first laid down, I
   shall explain and confirm the truth contained in it; that so it may be
   understood what we say, and whereof we do affirm, in the whole process
   of our discourse.

   It is a sad truth that we have proposed unto consideration. He that
   hears it ought to tremble in himself, that he may rest in the day of
   trouble. It speaks out the apostle's advice, Rom. xi. 20, "Be not
   high-minded, but fear;" and that also, 1 Cor. x. 12, "Let him that
   thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall." When Peter had learned
   this truth by woful experience, after all his boldness and frowardness,
   he gives this counsel to all saints, "That they would pass the time of
   their sojourning here in fear," 1 Pet. i. 17; knowing how near, in our
   greatest peace and serenity, evil and danger may lie at the door.

   Some few instances of the many that are left on record, wherein this
   truth is exemplified, may be mentioned: Gen. vi. 9, "Noah was a just
   man, perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God." He did so a
   long season, and that in an evil time, amidst all sorts of temptations,
   "when all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth," verse 12. This
   put an eminency upon his obedience, and doubtless rendered the
   communion which he had with God, in walking before him, most sweet and
   precious to him. He was a gracious soul, upon the redoubled testimony
   of God himself. But we know what befell this holy person. He that shall
   read the story that is recorded of him, Gen. ix. 20-27, will easily
   grant that he was brought into inextricable distress on the account of
   sin. His own drunkenness, verse 21, with the consequent of it, gives
   scandal unto and provokes the unnatural lust of his son, verse 22; and
   this leads him to the devoting of that son and his posterity unto
   destruction, verses 24, 25: all which, joined with the sense of God's
   just indignation, from whom he had newly received that tremendously
   miraculous deliverance, must needs overwhelm him with sorrow and
   anxiety of spirit.

   The matter is more clear in David. Under the Old Testament none loved
   God more than he; none was loved of God more than he. The paths of
   faith and love wherein he walked are unto the most of us like the way
   of an eagle in the air, -- too high and hard for us. Yet to this very
   day do the cries of this man after God's own heart sound in our ears.
   Sometimes he complains of broken bones, sometimes of drowning depths,
   sometimes of waves and water-spouts, sometimes of wounds and diseases,
   sometimes of wrath and the sorrows of hell; everywhere of his sins, the
   burden and trouble of them. Some of the occasions of his depths,
   darkness, entanglements, and distresses, we all know. As no man had
   more grace than he, so none is a greater instance of the power of sin,
   and the effects of its guilt upon the conscience, than he. But
   instances of this kind are obvious, and occur to the thoughts of all,
   so that they need not be repeated. I shall, then, show, --

   First, What in particular is intended by the depths and entanglements
   on the account of sin, whereinto gracious souls, after much communion
   with God, may be cast.

   Secondly, Whence it comes to pass that so they may be, and that
   oftentimes so they are.

   For the first, some or all of these things following do concur to the
   depths complained of:--

   1. Loss of the wonted sense of the love of God, which the soul did
   formerly enjoy. There is a twofold sense of the love of God, whereof
   believers in this world may be made partakers. There is the transient
   acting of the heart by the Holy Ghost with ravishing, unspeakable joys,
   in apprehension of God's love, and our relation unto him in Christ.
   This, or the immediate effect of it, is called "Joy unspeakable and
   full of glory," 1 Pet. i. 8. The Holy Ghost shining into the heart,
   with a clear evidence of the soul's interest in all gospel mercies,
   causeth it to leap for joy, to exult and triumph in the Lord, as being
   for a season carried above all sense and thought of sin,
   self-temptation, or trouble. But as God gives the bread of his house
   unto all Iris children, so these dainties and high cordials he
   reserveth only for the seasons and persons wherein and to whom he knows
   them to be needful and useful Believers may be without this sense of
   love, and yet be in no depths. A man may be strong and healthy who hath
   wholesome food, though he never drinks spirits and cordials.

   Again; there is an abiding, dwelling sense of God's love upon the
   hearts of the most of those of whom we speak, who have had long
   communion with God, consisting in a prevailing gospel persuasion that
   they are accepted with God in Christ: Rom. v. 1, "Being justified by
   faith, we have peace with God." I call it a prevailing persuasion,
   denoting both the opposition that is made unto it by Satan and
   unbelief, and its efficacy in the conquest thereof. This is the root
   from whence all that peace and ordinary consolation, which believers in
   this world are made partakers of, do spring and grow. This is that
   which quickens and enlivens them unto duty, Ps. cxvi. 12, 13, and is
   the salt that renders their sacrifices and performances savoury to God
   and refreshing to themselves. This supports them under their trials,
   gives them peace, hope, and comfort in life and death: Ps xxiii. 4,
   "Though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
   evil, for thou art with me." A sense of God's presence in love is
   sufficient to rebuke all anxiety and fears in the worst and most
   dreadful condition; and not only so, but to give in the midst of them
   solid consolation and joy. So the prophet expresseth it, Hab. iii. 17,
   18, "Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in
   the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall
   yield no meat; the flocks shall be cut off from the fold, and there
   shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will
   joy in the God of my salvation." And this is that sense of love which
   the choicest believers may lose on the account of sin. This is one step
   into their depths. They shall not retain any such gospel apprehension
   of it as that it should give them rest, peace, or consolation, -- that
   it should influence their souls with delight in duty or supportment in
   trial; and the nature hereof will be afterward more fully explained.

   2. Perplexed thoughtfulness about their great and wretched unkindness
   towards God is another part of the depths of sin-entangled souls. So
   David complains: Ps. lxxvii 3, "I remembered God," saith he, "and was
   troubled." How comes the remembrance of God to be unto him a matter of
   trouble? In other places he professeth that it was all his relief and
   supportment. How comes it to be an occasion of his trouble? All had not
   been well between God and him; and whereas formerly, in his remembrance
   of God, his thoughts were chiefly exercised about his love and
   kindness, now they were wholly possessed with him own sin and
   unkindness. This causeth his trouble. Herein lies a share of the
   entanglements occasioned by sin. Saith such a soul in itself, "Foolish
   creature, hast thou thus requited the Lord? Is this the return that
   thou hast made unto him for all his love, his kindness, his
   consolations, mercies? Is this thy kindness for him, thy love to him?
   Is this thy kindness to thy friend? Is this thy boasting of him, that
   thou hadst found so much goodness and excellency in him and his love,
   that though all men should forsake him, thou never wouldst do so? Are
   all thy promises, all thy engagements which thou madest unto God, in
   times of distress, upon prevailing obligations, and mighty impressions
   of his good Spirit upon thy soul, now come to this, that thou shouldst
   so foolishly forget, neglect, despise, cast him off? Well! now he is
   gone; he is withdrawn from thee; and what wilt thou do? Art thou not
   even ashamed to desire him to return?" They were thoughts of this
   nature that cut Peter to the heart upon his fall. The soul finds them
   cruel as death, and strong as the grave. It is bound in the chains of
   them, and cannot be comforted, Ps. xxxviii. 3-6. And herein consists a
   great part of the depths inquired after: for this consideration excites
   and puts an edge upon all grieving, straitening, perplexing affections,
   which are the only means whereby the soul of a man may be inwardly
   troubled, or trouble itself; such are sorrow and shame, with that
   self-displicency and revenge wherewith they are attended. And as their
   reason and object in this case do transcend all other occasions of
   them, so on no other account do they cause such severe and perplexing
   reflections on the soul as on this.

   3. A revived sense of justly deserved wrath belongs also to these
   depths. This is as the opening of old wounds. When men have passed
   through a sense of wrath, and have obtained deliverance and rest
   through the blood of Christ, to come to their old thoughts again, to be
   trading afresh with hell, curse, law, and wrath, it is a depth indeed.
   And this often befalls gracious souls on the account of sin: Ps.
   lxxxviii. 7, "Thy wrath lieth hard upon me," saith Heman. It pressed
   and crushed him sorely. There is a self-judging as to the desert of
   wrath, which is consistent with a comforting persuasion of an interest
   in Christ. This the soul finds sweetness in, as it lies in a
   subserviency to the exaltation of grace. But in this case, the soul is
   left under it without that relief. It plungeth itself into the curse of
   the law and flames of hell, without any cheering supportment from the
   blood of Christ. This is walking in "the valley of the shadow of
   death." The soul converseth with death and what seems to lie in a
   tendency thereunto. The Lord, also, to increase his perplexities, puts
   new life and spirit into the law, -- gives it a fresh commission, as it
   were, to take such a one into its custody; and the law will never in
   this world be wanting unto its duty.

   4. Oppressing apprehensions of temporal judgments concur herein also;
   for God will judge his people. And judgment often begins at the house
   of God." Though God," saith such a one, "should not cast me off for
   ever, though he should pardon my iniquities; yet he may so take
   vengeance of my inventions as to make me feed on gall and wormwood all
   my days." Ps. cxix. 120, saith David, "My flesh trembleth for fear of
   thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments? He knows not what the great God
   may bring upon him; and being full of a sense of the guilt of sin,
   which is the bottom of this whole condition, every judgment of God is
   full of terror unto him. Sometimes he thinks God may lay open the filth
   of his heart, and make him a scandal and a reproach in the world. Ps.
   xxxix. 8, "O," saith he, "make me not a reproach of the foolish."
   Sometimes he trembles lest God should strike him suddenly with some
   signal judgment, and take him out of the world in darkness and sorrow:
   so saith David, "Take me not away in thy wrath." Sometimes he fears
   lest he shall be like Jonah, and raise a storm in his family, in the
   church whereof he is a member, or in the whole nation: "Let them not be
   ashamed for my sake." These things make his heart soft, as Job speaks,
   and to melt within him. When any affliction or public judgment of God
   is fastened to a quick, living sense of sin in the conscience, it
   overwhelms the soul, whether it be only justly feared or be actually
   inflicted; as was the case of Joseph's brethren in Egypt. The soul is
   then rolled from one deep to another. Sense of sin casts it on the
   consideration of its affliction, and affliction turns it back on a
   sense of sin. So deep calleth unto deep, and all God's billows go over
   the soul. And they do each of them make the soul tender, and sharpen
   its sense unto the other. Affliction softens the soul, so that the
   sense of sin cuts the deeper, and makes the larger wounds; and the
   sense of sin weakens the soul, and makes affliction sit the heavier,
   and so increaseth its burden. In this case, that affliction which a man
   in his usual state of spiritual peace could have embraced as a sweet
   pledge of love, is as goads and thorns in his side, depriving him of
   all rest and quietness; God makes it as thorns and briers, wherewith he
   will teach stubborn souls their duty, as Gideon did the men of Succoth.

   5. There maybe added hereunto prevailing fears for a season of being
   utterly rejected by God, of being found a reprobate at the last day.
   Jonah seems to conclude so, chap. ii. 4, "Then I said, I am cast out of
   thy sight;" -- "I am lost for ever, God will own me no more." And
   Heman, Ps. lxxxviii. 4, 5, "I am counted with them that go down into
   the pit: free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
   whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand."
   This may reach the soul, until the sorrows of hell encompass it and lay
   hold upon it; until it be deprived of comfort, peace, rest; until it be
   a terror to itself, and be ready to choose strangling rather than life.
   This may befall a gracious soul on the account of sin. But yet because
   this fights directly against the life of faith, God doth not, unless it
   be in extraordinary cases, suffer any of his to lie long in this
   horrible pit, where there is no water, no refreshment. But this often
   falls out, that even the saints themselves are left for a season to a
   fearful expectation of judgment and fiery indignation, as to the
   prevailing apprehension of their minds. And, --

   6. God secretly sends his arrows into the soul, that wound and gall it,
   adding pain, trouble, and disquietness to its disconsolation: Ps.
   xxxviii. 2, "Thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me
   sore." Ever and anon in his walking, God shot a sharp piercing arrow,
   fixing it on his soul, that galled, wounded, and perplexed him, filling
   him with pain and grievous vexation. These arrows are God's rebukes:
   Ps. xxxix. 11, "When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity."
   God speaks in his word, and by his Spirit in the conscience, things
   sharp and bitter to the soul, fastening them so as it cannot shake them
   out. These Job so mournfully complains of, chap. vi. 4. The Lord speaks
   words with that efficacy, that they pierce the heart quite through; and
   what the issue then is David declares, Ps. xxxviii. 3, "There is no
   soundness," saith he, "in my flesh because of thine anger; nor is there
   any rest in my bones because of my sin." The whole person is brought
   under the power of them, and all health and rest is taken away. And, --

   7. Unspiritedness and disability unto duty, in doing or suffering,
   attend such a condition: Ps. xl. 12, "Mine iniquities have taken hold
   upon me, so that I am not able to look up." His spiritual strength was
   worn away by sin, so that he was not able to address himself unto any
   communion with God. The soul now cannot pray with life and power,
   cannot hear with joy and profit, cannot do good and communicate with
   cheerfulness and freedom, cannot meditate with delight and
   heavenly-mindedness, cannot act for God with zeal and liberty, cannot
   think of suffering with boldness and resolution; but is sick, weak,
   feeble, and bowed down.

   Now, I say, a gracious soul, after much communion with God, may, on the
   account of sin, by a sense of the guilt of it, be brought into a state
   and condition wherein some, more, or all of these, with other the like
   perplexities, may be its portion; and these make up the depths whereof
   the psalmist here complains. What are the sins, or of what sorts, that
   ordinarily east the souls of believers into these depths, shall be
   afterwards declared.

   Secondly, I shall now show both whence it is that believers may fall
   into such a condition, as also whence it is that oftentimes they
   actually do so.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Whence it is that believers may be brought into depths on account of
   sin -- Nature of the supplies of grace given in the covenant -- How far
   they extend -- Principles of the power of sin.

   First, The nature of the covenant wherein all believers now walk with
   God, and wherein all their whole provision for obedience is inwrapped,
   leaves it possible for them to fall into these depths that have been
   mentioned. Under the first covenant there was no mercy or forgiveness
   provided for any sin. It was necessary, then, that it should exhibit a
   sufficiency of grace to preserve them from every sin, or it could have
   been of no use at all. This the righteousness of God required, and so
   it was. To have made a covenant wherein there was no provision at all
   of pardon, and not a sufficiency of grace to keep the covenanters from
   need of pardon, was not answerable to the goodness and righteousness of
   God. But he made man upright, who, of his own accord, sought out many
   inventions.

   It is not so in the covenant of grace; there is in it pardon provided
   in the blood of Christ: it is not, therefore, of indispensable
   necessity that there should be administered in it grace effectually
   preserving from every sin. Yet it is on all accounts to be preferred
   before the other; for, besides the relief by pardon, which the other
   knew nothing of, there is in it also much provision against sin, which
   was not in the other:--

   1. There is provision made in it against all and every sin that would
   disannul the covenant, and make a final separation between God and a
   soul that hath been once taken into the bond thereof. This provision is
   absolute. God hath taken upon himself the making of this good, and the
   establishing this law of the covenant, that it shall not by any sin be
   disannulled: Jer. xxxii. 40, "I will," saith God, "make an everlasting
   covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them
   good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not
   depart from me." The security hereof depends not on any thing in
   ourselves. All that is in us is to be used as a means of the
   accomplishment of this promise; but the event or issue depends
   absolutely on the faithfulness of God. And the whole certainty and
   stability of the covenant depends on the efficacy of the grace
   administered in it to preserve men from all such sins as would disannul
   it.

   2. There is in this covenant provision made for constant peace and
   consolation, notwithstanding and against the guilt of such sins as,
   through their infirmities and temptations, believers are daily exposed
   unto. Though they fall into sins every day, yet they do not fall into
   depths every day. In the tenor of this covenant there is a consistency
   between a sense of sin unto humiliation and peace, with strong
   consolation. After the apostle had described the whole conflict that
   believers have with sin, and the frequent wounds which they receive
   thereby, which makes them cry out for deliverance, Rom. vii. 24, he yet
   concludes, chap. viii. 1, that "there is no condemnation unto them;"
   which is a sufficient and stable foundation of peace. So, 1 John ii. 1,
   "These things I write unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we
   have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." Our
   great business and care ought to be, that we sin not; but yet, when we
   have done our utmost, "if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,"
   chap. i. 8. What, then, shall poor, sinful, guilty creatures do? Why,
   let them go to the Father by their advocate, and they shall not fail of
   pardon and peace. And, saith Paul, Heb. vi. 17, 18, "God is abundantly
   willing that we might have strong consolation, who fly for refuge to
   lay hold on the hope set before us." What was his condition who fled of
   old to the city of refuge for safety, from whence this expression is
   taken? He was guilty of blood, though shed at unawares; and so as that
   he was to die for it, if he escaped not to the city of refuge. Though
   we may have the guilt of sins upon us that the law pronounceth death
   unto, yet, flying to Christ for refuge, God hath provided not only
   safety, but "strong consolation" for us also. Forgiveness in the blood
   of Christ doth not only take guilt from the soul, but trouble also from
   the conscience; and in this respect doth the apostle at large set forth
   the excellency of his sacrifice, Heb. x. The sacrifices of the old law,
   he tells us, could not make perfect the worshippers, verse 1: which he
   proves, verse 2, because they did never take away, thoroughly and
   really, conscience of sin; that is, depths or distresses of conscience
   about sin. "But now," saith he, "Jesus Christ, in the covenant of
   grace, hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified,' verse 14;
   providing for them such stable peace and consolation, as that they
   shall not need the renewing of sacrifices every day," verse 18. This is
   the great mystery of the gospel in the blood of Christ, that those who
   sin every day should have peace with God all their days, provided their
   sins fall within the compass of those infirmities against which this
   consolation is provided.

   3. There is provision made of grace to prevent and preserve the soul
   from great and enormous sins, such as in their own nature are apt to
   wound conscience, and cast the person into such depths and
   entanglements as wherein he shall have neither rest nor peace. Of what
   sort these sins are shall be afterward declared. There is in this
   covenant "grace for grace," John i. 16, and abundance of grace
   administered from the all-fulness of Christ. Grace reigneth in it, Rom.
   vi. 6, destroying and crucifying "the body of sin."

   But this provision in the covenant of grace against peace-ruining,
   soul-perplexing sins, is not, as to the administration of it, absolute.
   There are covenant commands and exhortations, on the attendance
   whereunto the administration of much covenant grace doth depend. To
   watch, pray, improve faith, to stand on our guard continually, to
   mortify sin, to fight against temptations, with steadfastness,
   diligence, constancy, are everywhere prescribed unto us; and that in
   order unto the insurance of the grace mentioned. These things are on
   our part the condition of the administration of that abundant grace
   which is to preserve us from soul-entangling sins. So Peter informs us,
   2 Epist. i. 3, "The divine power of God hath given unto us all things
   that pertain unto life and godliness." We have from it an habitual
   furnishment and provision for obedience at all times. Also, saith he,
   verse 4, "He hath given unto us exceeding great and precious promises,
   that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature." What, then,
   is in this blessed estate and condition required of us, that we may
   make a due improvement of the provision made for us, and enjoy the
   comforting influence of those promises that he prescribes unto us?
   Verses 5-7, "Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to
   virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance
   patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness
   brotherly-kindness, and to brotherly-kindness charity;" that is,
   carefully and diligently attend to the exercise of all the graces of
   the Spirit, and unto a conversation in all things becoming the gospel.
   What, then, shall be the issue if these things are attended unto? Verse
   8, "If these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall
   neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
   Christ." It is not enough that these things be in you, that you have
   the seed and root of them from and by the Holy Ghost; but you are to
   take care that they flourish and abound: without which, though the root
   of the matter may be in you, and so you be not wholly devoid of
   spiritual life, yet you will be poor, barren, sapless, withering
   creatures all your days. But now, suppose that these things do abound,
   and we be made fruitful thereby? Why then, saith he, verse 10, "If ye
   do these things, ye shall never fall." What! never fall into sin? Nay,
   that is not in the promise; and he that says, when he hath done all,
   "that he hath no sin, he is a liar." Or is it never fall totally from
   God? No; the preservation of the elect, of whom he speaks, from total
   apostasy, is not suspended on such conditions, especially not on any
   degree of them, such as their abounding imports. But it is that they
   shall not fall into their old sins, from which they were purged, verse
   9, -- such conscience-wasting and defiling sins as they lived in, in
   the time and state of their unregeneracy. Thus, though there be, in the
   covenant of grace through Jesus Christ, provision made of abundant
   supplies for the soul's preservation from entangling sins, yet their
   administration hath respect unto our diligent attendance unto the means
   of receiving them appointed for us to walk in.

   And here lies the latitude of the new covenant, here lies the exercise
   of renewed free-will. This is the field of free, voluntary obedience,
   under the administration of gospel grace. There are extremes which, in
   respect of the event, it is not concerned in. To be wholly perfect, to
   be free from every sin, all failings, all infirmities, that is not
   provided for, not promised in this covenant. It is a covenant of mercy
   and pardon, which supposeth a continuance of sin. To fall utterly and
   finally from God, that is absolutely provided against. Between these
   two extremes of absolute perfection and total apostasy lies the large
   field of believers' obedience and walking with God. Many a sweet,
   heavenly passage there is, and many a dangerous depth, in this field.
   Some walk near to the one side, some to the other; yea, the same person
   may sometimes press hard after perfection, sometimes be cast to the
   very border of destruction. Now, between these two lie many a
   soul-plunging sin, against which no absolute provision is made, and
   which, for want of giving all diligence to put the means of
   preservation in practice, believers are oftentimes overtaken withal.

   4. There is not in the covenant of grace provision made of ordinary and
   abiding consolation for any under the guilt of great sins, or sins
   greatly aggravated, which they fall into by a neglect of using and
   abiding in the fore-mentioned conditions of abounding actual grace.
   Sins there are which, either because in their own nature they wound and
   waste conscience, or in their effects break forth into scandal, causing
   the name of God and the gospel to be evil spoken of, or in some of
   their circumstances are full of unkindness against God, do deprive the
   soul of its wonted consolation. How, by what means, on what account,
   such sins come to terrify conscience, to break the bones, to darken the
   soul, and to cast it into inextricable depths, notwithstanding the
   relief that is provided of pardon in the blood of Christ, I shall not
   now declare; that they will do so, and that consolation is not of equal
   extent with safety, we know. Hence God assumes it to himself, as an act
   of mere sovereign grace, to speak peace and refreshment unto the souls
   of his saints in their depths of sin-entanglements, Isa. lvii. 18, 19.
   And, indeed, if the Lord had not thus provided that great provocation
   should stand in need of special reliefs, it might justly be feared that
   the negligence of believers might possibly bring forth much bitter
   fruit.

   Only, this must be observed by the way, that what is spoken relates to
   the sense of sinners in their own souls, and not to the nature of the
   thing itself. There is in the gospel consolation provided against the
   greatest as well as the least sins. The difference ariseth from God's
   sovereign communication of it, according to the tenor of the covenant's
   administration, which we have laid down. Hence, because under Moses'
   law there was an exception made of some sins, for which there was no
   sacrifice appointed, so that those who were guilty of them could no way
   be justified from them, -- that is, carnally, as to their interest in
   the Judaical church and polity, -- Paul tells the Jews, Acts xiii. 38,
   39, that "through Jesus Christ was preached unto them the forgiveness
   of sins: and that by him all that believe axe justified from all
   things, from which they could not be justified by the law of Moses."
   There is now no exception of any particular sins as to pardon and
   peace; but what we have spoken relates unto the manner and way wherein
   God is pleased to administer consolation to the souls of sinning
   believers.

   And this is the evidence which I shall offer to prove that the souls of
   believers, after much gracious communion with God, may yet fall into
   inextricable depths on the account of sin; whence it is that actually
   they oftentimes do so shall be farther declared.

   The principles of this assertion axe known, I shall therefore only
   touch upon them:--

   First. The nature of indwelling sin, as it remains in the best of the
   saints in this life, being a little considered, will evidence unto us
   from whence it is that they are sometimes surprised and plunged into
   the depths mentioned; for, --

   1. Though the strength of every sin be weakened by grace, yet the root
   of no sin is in this life wholly taken away. Lust is like the stubborn
   Canaanites, who, after the general conquest of the land, would dwell in
   it still, Josh. xvii. 12. Indeed, when Israel grew strong they brought
   them under tribute, but they could not utterly expel them. The kingdom
   and rule belongs to grace; and when it grows strong it brings sin much
   under, but it will not wholly be driven out. The body of death is not
   utterly to be done away, but in and by the death of the body. In the
   flesh of the best saints there "dwelleth no good thing," Rom. vii. 18;
   but the contrary is there, -- that is, the root of all evil: "The flesh
   lusteth against the Spirit," as "the Spirit lusteth against the flesh,"
   Gal. v. 17. As, then, there is a universality in the actings of the
   Spirit in its opposing all evil, so also there is a universality in the
   actings of the flesh for the furtherance of it.

   2. Some lusts or branches of original corruption do obtain in some
   persons such advantages, either from nature, custom, employment,
   society, or the like circumstances, that they become like the
   Canaanites that had iron chariots; it is a very difficult thing to
   subdue them. Well it is if war be maintained constantly against them,
   for they will almost always be in actual rebellion.

   3. Indwelling sin though weakened retaineth all its properties. The
   properties of a thing follow its nature. Where the nature of any thing
   is, there are all its natural properties. What are these properties of
   indwelling sin I should here declare, but that I have handled the whole
   power and efficacy, the nature and properties of it, in a treatise to
   that only purpose. In brief, they are such as it is no wonder that some
   believers are by them cast into depths; but it is indeed that they do
   escape them. But thereof the reader may see at large my discourse on
   this particular subject. [1]

   Secondly. Add hereunto the power and prevalency of temptation; which,
   because also I have already, in a special discourse to that purpose,
   [2] insisted on, I shall not here farther lay open.

   Thirdly. The sovereign pleasure of God in dealing with sinning saints
   must also be considered. Divine love and wisdom work not towards all in
   the same manner. God is pleased to continue peace unto some with a
   "non-obstante," for great provocations. Love shall humble them, and
   rebukes of kindness shall recover them from their wanderings. Others he
   is pleased to bring into the depths we have been speaking of. But yet I
   may say generally, signal provocations meet with one of these two
   events from God -- First, Those in whom they are are left into some
   signal barrenness and fruitlessness in their generations; they shall
   wither, grow barren, worldly, sapless, and be much cast out of the
   hearts of the people of God. Or, secondly, They shall be exercised in
   these depths, from whence their way of deliverance is laid down in this
   psalm. Thus, I say, God deals with his saints in great variety; some
   shall have all their bones broken, when others shall have only the
   gentle strokes of the rod. We are in the hand of mercy, and he may deal
   with us as seems good unto him; but for our parts, great sins ought to
   be attended with expectations of great depths and perplexities.

   And this is the state of the soul proposed in this psalm, and by us,
   unto consideration. These are the depths wherein it is entangled; these
   are the ways and means whereby it is brought into these depths. Its
   deportment in and under this state and condition lies next in our way.
   But before I proceed thereunto, I shall annex some few things unto what
   hath been delivered, tending to the farther opening of the whole case
   before us. And they are, -- 1. What are, or of what sort those sins
   are, which usually cast the souls of believers into these depths; and
   then, 2. Insist on some aggravations of them.

   What sins usually bring believers into great spiritual distresses --
   Aggravations of these sins.

   First, Sins in their own nature wasting conscience are of this sort;
   sins that rise in opposition unto all of God that is in us; that is,
   the light of grace and nature also. Such are the sins that cast David
   into his depths; such are the sins enumerated, 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. "Be
   not deceived," saith the apostle: "neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
   nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
   nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
   extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." Certain it is that
   believers may fall into some of the sins here mentioned. Some have done
   so, as is left on record. The apostle says not those who have committed
   any of these sins, but such sinners, shall not inherit the kingdom of
   God; that is, who live in these sins, or any like unto them. There is
   no provision of mercy made for such sinners. These and the like are
   sins which in their own nature, without the consideration of
   aggravating circumstances (which yet, indeed, really in believers they
   can never be without), are able to plunge a soul into depths, These
   sins cut the locks of men's spiritual strength; and it is in vain for
   them to say, "We will go, and do as at other times." Bones are not
   broken without pain; nor great sins brought on the conscience without
   trouble. But I need not insist on these. Some say that they deprive
   even true believers of all their interest in the love of God, but
   unduly; all grant that they bereave them of all comforting evidence and
   well-grounded assurance of it. So they did David and Peter. And herein
   lies no small part of the depths we are searching into.

   Secondly. There are sins which, though they do not rise up in the
   conscience with such a bloody guilt as those mentioned, yet, by reason
   of some circumstances and aggravations, God takes them so unkindly as
   to make them a root of disquietness and trouble to the soul all its
   days. He says of some sins of ungodly men, "As I live, this iniquity
   shall not be purged from you until ye die. If you are come to this
   height, you shall not escape. I will not spare you." And there are
   provocations in his own people which may be so circumstantiated as that
   he will not let them pass before he have cast them into depths, and
   made them cry out for deliverance. Let us consider some of them:--

   1. Miscarriages under signal enjoyments of love and kindness from God
   are of this sort. When God hath given unto any one expressive
   manifestations of his love, convinced him of it, made him say in the
   inmost parts of his heart, "This is undeserved love and kindness;" --
   then for him to be negligent in his walking with God, it carrieth an
   unkindness with it that shall not be forgotten. It is a remark upon the
   miscarriages of Solomon, that he fell into them after God had "appeared
   unto him twice." And all sins under or after especial mercies will
   meet, at one time or other, especial rebukes. Nothing doth more
   distress the conscience of a sinner than the remembrance, in darkness,
   of abused light; in desertions, of neglected love. This God will make
   them sensible of." Though I have redeemed them," saith God, "yet they
   have spoken lies against me," Hos. vii. 13: so chap. xiii. 4-7. When
   God hath in his providence dealt graciously with a person, -- it may be
   delivered him from straits and troubles, set him in a large place,
   prevented him with many fruits and effects of his goodness, blessed him
   in his person, relations, and employments, dealt well with his soul, in
   giving him a gracious sense of his love in Christ; -- for such a one to
   fall under sinful miscarriages, it goes to the heart of God, and shall
   not be passed over. Under-valuations of love are great provocations."
   Hath Nabal thus requited my kindness...." saith David." I cannot bear
   it." And the clearer the convictions of any in this kind were, the more
   severe will their reflections be upon themselves.

   2. Sins under or after great afflictions are of this importance also.
   God doth not afflict willingly, or chasten us merely for his pleasure;
   he doth it to make us partakers of his holiness. To take so little
   notice of his hand herein, as under it or after it not to watch against
   the workings and surprisals of sin, it hath unkindness in it: "I smote
   him," saith God, "and he went on frowardly in the way of his own
   heart." These provocations of his sons and daughters he cannot bear
   with. Hath God brought thee into the furnace, so that thou hast melted
   under his hand, and in pity and compassion hath given thee enlargement?
   -- if thou hast soon forgotten his dealings with thee, is it any wonder
   if he mind thee again by troubles in thy soul?

   3. Breaking off from under strong convictions and dawnings of love
   before conversion, are oftentimes remembered upon the conscience
   afterward. When the Lord by his Spirit shall mightily convince the
   heart of sin, and make withal some discoveries of his love and the
   excellencies of Christ unto it, so that it begins to yield and be
   overpowered, being almost persuaded to be a Christian; -- if, then,
   through the strength of lust or unbelief, it goes back to the world or
   self-righteousness, its folly hath unkindness with it that, sometimes
   shall not be passed by. God can, and often doth, put forth the
   greatness of his power for the recovery of such a soul; but yet he will
   deal with him about this contempt of his love and the excellency of his
   Son, in the dawnings of them revealed unto him.

   4. Sudden forgetfulness of endearing manifestations of special love.
   This God cautions his people against, as knowing their proneness
   thereunto: Ps. lxxxv. 8, "God the Lord will speak peace to his people,
   and to his saints; but let them not turn again to folly." Let them take
   heed of their aptness to forget endearing manifestations of special
   love. When God at any time draws nigh to a soul by his Spirit, in his
   word, with gracious words of peace and love, giving a sense of his
   kindness upon the heart by the Holy Ghost, so that it is filled with
   joy unspeakable and glorious thereon; -- for this soul, upon a
   temptation, a diversion, or by mere carelessness and neglect, which
   oftentimes falls out, to suffer this sense of love to be as it were
   obliterated, and so to lose that influencing efficacy unto obedience
   which it is accompanied withal, this also is full of unkindness. An
   account hereof we have, Cant. v. 1-6. In the first verse the Lord Jesus
   draws nigh, with full provision of gospel mercies for his beloved: "I
   am come unto thee," saith he, "O my sister. I have brought myrrh and
   spice, honey and wine, with me: whatever is spiritually sweet and
   delightful, -- mercy, grace, peace, consolation, joy, assurance, --
   they are all here in readiness for thee." Verse 2. The spouse, in her
   drowsy indisposition, takes little notice of this gracious visit; she
   is diverted by other matters, and knows not how to attend fully and
   wholly to the blessed communion offered unto her, but excuseth herself
   as otherwise engaged. But what is the issue? Christ withdraws, leaves
   her in the dark, in the midst of many disconsolations, and long it is
   before she obtain any recovery.

   5. Great opportunities for service neglected and great gifts not
   improved are oftentimes the occasion of plunging the soul into great
   depths. Gifts are given to trade withal for God. Opportunities are the
   market-days for that trade. To napkin up the one and to let slip the
   other will end in trouble and disconsolation. Disquietments and
   perplexities of heart are worms that will certainly breed in the rust
   of unexercised gifts. God loseth a revenue of glory and honour by such
   slothful souls; and he will make them sensible of it. I know some at
   this day whom omissions of opportunities for service are ready to sink
   into the grave.

   6. Sins after especial warnings are usually thus issued. In all that
   variety of special warnings which God is pleased to use towards sinning
   saints, I shall single out one only:-- When a soul is wrestling with
   some lust or temptation, God by his providence causeth some special
   word, in the preaching of the gospel, or the administration of some
   ordinance thereof, peculiarly suited to the state and condition of the
   soul, by the ways of rebuke or persuasion, to come nigh and enter the
   inmost parts of the heart. The soul cannot but take notice that God is
   nigh to him, that he is dealing with him, and calling on him to look to
   him for assistance. And he seldom gives such warnings to his saints but
   that he is nigh them in an eminent manner to give them relief and help,
   if, in answer unto his call, they apply themselves unto him; but if his
   care and kindness herein be neglected, his following reproofs are
   usually more severe.

   7. Sins that bring scandal seldom suffer the soul to escape depths.
   Even in great sins, God in chastening takes more notice ofttimes of the
   scandal than the sin; as 2 Sam. xii. 14. Many professors take little
   notice of their worldliness, their pride, their passion, their lavish
   tongues; but the world doth, and the gospel is disadvantaged by it: and
   no wonder if themselves find from the hand of the Lord the bitter
   fruits of them in the issue.

   And many other such aggravations of sins there are, which heighten
   provocations in their own nature not of so dreadful an aspect as some
   others, into a guilt plunging a soul into depths. Those which have been
   named may suffice in the way of instance; which is all that we have
   aimed at, and therefore forbear enlargements on the several heads of
   them.

   The consideration of some aggravations of the guilt of these sins,
   which bring the soul usually into the condition before laid down, shall
   close this discourse:--

   1. The soul is furnished with a principle of grace, which is
   continually operative and working for its preservation from such sins.
   The new creature is living and active for its own growth, increase, and
   security, according to the tenor of the covenant of grace: Gal. v. 17,
   it "lusteth against the flesh." It is naturally active for its own
   preservation and increase, as newborn children have a natural
   inclination to the food that will keep them alive and cause them to
   grow, 1 Pet. ii 2. The soul, then, cannot fall into these entangling
   sins, but it must be with a high neglect of that very principle which
   is bestowed upon it for quite contrary ends and purposes. The
   labourings, lustings, desires, crying of it are neglected. Now, it is
   from God, and is the renovation of his image in us, -- that which God
   owneth and careth for. The wounding of its vitals, the stifling its
   operations, the neglect of its endeavours for the soul's preservation,
   do always attend sins of the importance spoken unto.

   2. Whereas this new creature, this principle of life and obedience, is
   not able of itself to preserve the soul from such sins as will bring it
   into depths, there is full provision for continual supplies made for it
   and all its wants in Jesus Christ. There are treasures of relief in
   Christ, whereunto the soul may at any time repair and find succour
   against the incursions of sin. He says to the soul, as David unto
   Abiathar, when he fled from Doeg, "Abide thou with me, fear not: for he
   that seeketh my life, seeketh thy life; but with me thou shalt be in
   safe-guard;" -- "Sin is my enemy no less than thine; it seeketh the
   life of thy soul, and it seeketh my life. Abide with me, for with me
   thou shalt be in safety.' This the apostle exhorts us unto, Heb. iv.
   16, "Let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain
   mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." If ever it be a time of
   need with a soul, it is so when it is under the assaults of provoking
   sins. At such a time, there is suitable and seasonable help in Christ
   for succour and relief. The new creature begs, with sighs and groans,
   that the soul would apply itself unto him. To neglect him with all his
   provision of grace, whilst he stands calling unto us, "Open unto me,
   for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the
   night;" to despise the sighing of the poor prisoner, the new creature,
   by sin appointed to die, cannot but be a high provocation. May not God
   complain and say, "See these poor creatures. They were once intrusted
   with a stock of grace in themselves; this they cast away, and
   themselves into the utmost misery thereby. That they might not utterly
   perish a second time, their portion and stock is now laid up in
   another, -- a safe treasurer; in him are their lives and comforts
   secured. But see their wretched negligence; they venture all rather
   than they will attend to him for succour." And what think we is the
   heart of Christ when he sees his children giving way to
   conscience-wasting sins, without that application unto him which the
   life and peace of their own souls calls upon them for? These are not
   sins of daily infirmity, which cannot be avoided; but their guilt is
   always attended with a neglect more or less of the relief provided in
   Christ against them. The means of preservation from them is blessed,
   ready, nigh at hand; the concernment of Christ in our preservation
   great, of our souls unspeakable. To neglect and despise means, Christ,
   souls, peace, and life, must needs render guilt very guilty.

   3. Much to the same purpose may be spoken about that signal provision
   that is made against such sins as these in the covenant of grace, as
   hath been already declared; but I shall not farther carry on this
   discourse.

   And this may suffice as to the state and condition of the soul in this
   psalm represented. We have seen what the depths are wherein it is
   entangled, and by what ways and means any one may come to be cast into
   them. The next thing that offers itself unto our consideration is the
   deportment of a gracious soul in that state or condition, or what
   course it steers towards a delivery.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The duty and actings of a believer under distresses from a sense of sin
   -- His application unto God, to God alone -- Earnestness and intension
   of mind therein.

   II. The words of these two first verses declare also the deportment of
   the soul in the condition that we have described; that is, what it
   doth, and what course it steers for relief." I have cried unto thee, O
   Lord. Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of
   my supplications."

   There is in the words a general application made in a tendency unto
   relief; wherein is first to be considered to whom the application is
   made; and that is Jehovah: "I have cried unto thee, Jehovah." God gave
   out that name to his people to confirm their faith in the stability of
   his promises, Exod. iii. He who is Being himself will assuredly give
   being and subsistence to his promises. Being to deal with God about the
   promises of grace, he makes his application to him under this name: I
   call upon thee, Jehovah.

   In the application itself may be observed, -- First, The anthropopathy
   of the expression. He prays that God would cause his ears to be
   attentive; after the manner of men who seriously attend to what is
   spoken to them, when they turn aside from that which they regard not.
   Secondly, The earnestness of the soul in the work it hath in hand;
   which is evident both from the reduplication of his request, "Lord,
   hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my
   supplications;" and the emphaticalness of the words he maketh use of:
   "Let thine ears," saith he, "be qsvvt?, -- diligently attentive." The
   word signifies the most diligent heedfulness and close attention: "Let
   thine ears be very attentive." And unto what? lqvl tchnvny?, -- "To the
   voice of my supplications." "Deprecationum mearum," generally say
   interpreters; -- "Of my deprecations," or earnest prayers for the
   averting of evil or punishment. But the word is from chnn?, "Gratiosus
   fuit," to be gracious or merciful; so that it signifies properly
   supplication for grace." Be attentive," saith he, "O Lord, unto my
   supplications for grace and mercy, which, according to my extreme
   necessity, I now address myself to make unto thee." And in these words
   doth the psalmist set forth in general the frame and working of a
   gracious soul being cast into depths and darkness by sin.

   The foundation of what I shall farther thence pursue lies m these two
   propositions:--

   First, The only attempt of a sinful, entangled soul for relief lies in
   an application to God alone: "To thee, Jehovah, have I cried; Lord,
   hear."

   Secondly, Depths of sin-entanglements will put a gracious soul on
   intense and earnest applications unto God: "Lord, hear; Lord, attend."
   Dying men do not use to cry out slothfully for relief.

   What may be thought necessary in general for the direction of a soul in
   the state and condition described, shall briefly be spoken unto from
   these two propositions:--

   1. Trouble, danger, disquietment, arguing not only things evil, but a
   sense in the mind and soul of them, will of themselves put those in
   whom they are upon seeking relief. Every thing would naturally be at
   rest. A drowning man needs no exhortation to endeavour his own
   deliverance and safety; and spiritual troubles will, in like manner,
   put men on attempts for relief. To seek for no remedy is to be
   senselessly obdurate, or wretchedly desperate, as Cain and Judas. We
   may suppose, then, that the principal business of every soul in depths
   is to endeavour deliverance. They cannot rest in that condition wherein
   they have no rest. In this endeavour, what course a gracious soul
   steers is laid down in the first proposition, negatively and
   positively. He applies himself not to any thing but God; he applies
   himself unto God. An eminent instance we have of it in both parts, or
   both to the one side and the other, Hos. xiv. 3, "Asshur," say those
   poor, distressed, returning sinners, "shall not save us; we will not
   ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our
   hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy."
   Their application unto God is attended with a renunciation of every
   other way of relief.

   Several things there are that sinners are apt to apply themselves unto
   for relief in their perplexities, which prove unto them as waters that
   fail. How many things have the Romanists invented to deceive souls
   withal! Saints and angels, the blessed Virgin, the wood of the cross,
   confessions, penances, masses, pilgrimages, dirges, purgatories, papal
   pardons, works of compensation, and the like, are made entrances for
   innumerable souls into everlasting ruin. Did they know the terror of
   the Lord, the nature of sin, and of the mediation of Christ, they would
   be ashamed and confounded in themselves for these abominations; they
   would not say unto these their idols, "Ye are our gods; come and save
   us." How short do all their contrivances come of his that would fain be
   offering "rivers of oil, yea, the fruit of his body, for the sin of his
   soul, his first-born for his transgression," Micah vi. 7, who yet gains
   nothing but an aggravation of his sin and misery thereby! yea, the
   heathens went beyond them in devotion and expense. It is no new
   inquiry, what course sin-perplexed souls should take for relief. From
   the foundation of the world, the minds of far the greatest part of
   mankind have been exercised in it. As was their light or darkness, such
   was the course they took. Among those who were ignorant of God, this
   inquiry brought forth all that diabolical superstition which spread
   itself over the face of the whole world. Gentilism being destroyed by
   the power and efficacy of the gospel, the same inquiry working in the
   minds of darkened men, in conjunction with other lusts, brought forth
   the Papacy. When men had lost a spiritual acquaintance with the
   covenant of grace and mystery of the gospel, the design of eternal
   love, and efficacy of the blood of Christ, they betook themselves, in
   part or in whole, for relief under their entanglements, unto the broken
   cisterns mentioned. They are of two sorts, -- self, and other things.
   For those other things which belong unto their false worship, being
   abominated by all the saints of God, I shall not need to make any
   farther mention of them. That which relates unto self is not confined
   unto Popery, but confines itself to the limits of human nature, and is
   predominate over all that are under the law; that is, to seek for
   relief in sin-distresses by self-endeavours, self-righteousness. Hence
   many poor souls in straits apply themselves to themselves. They expect
   their cure from the same hand that wounded them. This was the life of
   Judaism, as the apostle informs us, Rom. x. 3. And all men under the
   law are still animated by the same principle. They return, but not unto
   the Lord. Finding themselves in depths, in distresses about sin, what
   course do they take? This they will do, that they will do no more; this
   shall be their ordinary course, and that they will do in an
   extraordinary manner; as they have offended, whence their trouble
   ariseth, so they will amend, and look that their peace should spring
   from thence, as if God and they stood on equal terms. In this way some
   spend all their days; sinning and amending, amending and sinning,
   without once coming to repentance and peace. This the souls of
   believers watch against. They look on themselves as fatherless: "In
   thee the fatherless findeth mercy;" that is, helpless, -- without the
   least ground of hopes in themselves or expectation from themselves.
   They know their repentance, their amendment, their supplications, their
   humiliations, their fastings, their mortifications, will not relieve
   them. Repent they will, and amend they will, and pray, and fast, and
   humble their souls, for they know these things to be their duty; but
   they know that their goodness extends not to Him with whom they have to
   do, nor is He profited by their righteousness They will be in the
   performance of all duties; but they expect not deliverance by any
   duty." It is God," say they, "with whom we have to do: our business is
   to hearken what he will say unto us."

   There are also other ways whereby sinful souls destroy themselves by
   false reliefs. Diversions from their perplexing thoughtfulness please
   them. They will fix on something or other that cannot cure their
   disease, but shall only make them forget that they are sick; as Cain,
   under the terror of his guilt, departed from the presence of the Lord,
   and sought inward rest in outward labour and employment. He went and
   built a city, Gen. iv. 17. Such courses Saul fixed on; first music,
   then a witch. Nothing more ordinary than for men thus to deal with
   their convictions. They see their sickness, feel their wound, and go to
   the Assyrian, Hos. v. 13. And this insensibly leads men into atheism.
   Frequent applications of creature-diversions unto convictions of sin
   are a notable means of bringing on final impenitency. Some drunkards
   had, it may be, never been so, had they not been first convinced of
   other sins. They strive to stifle the guilt of one sin with another.
   They fly from themselves unto themselves, from their consciences unto
   their lusts, and seek for relief from sin by sinning. This is so far
   from believers, that they will not allow lawful things to be a
   diversion of their distress. Use lawful things they may and will, but
   not to divert their thoughts from their distresses. These they know
   must be issued between God and them. Wear off they will not, but must
   be taken away. These rocks, and the like, whereof there are
   innumerable, I say, a gracious soul takes care to avoid. He knows it is
   God alone who is the Lord of his conscience, where his depths lie; God
   alone against whom he hath sinned; God alone who can pardon his sin.
   From dealing with him he will be neither enticed nor diverted." To
   thee, O Lord," saith he, "do I come; thy word concerning me must stand;
   upon thee will I wait. If thou hast no delight in me, I must perish.
   Other remedies I know are vain. I intend not to spend my strength for
   that which is not bread. Unto thee do I cry." Here a sin-entangled soul
   is to fix itself. Trouble excites it to look for relief. Many things
   without it present themselves as a diversion; many things within it
   offer themselves for a remedy." Forget thy sorrow," say the former;
   "Ease thyself of it by us," say the latter. The soul refuseth both, as
   physicians of no value, and to God alone makes its application. He hath
   wounded, and he alone can heal. And until any one that is sensible of
   the guilt of sin will come off from all reserves to deal immediately
   with God, it is in vain for him to expect relief.

   2. Herein it is intense, earnest, and urgent; which was the second
   thing observed. It is no time now to be slothful. The soul's all, its
   greatest concernments are at the stake. Dull, cold, formal, customary
   applications to God will not serve the turn. Ordinary actings of faith,
   love, fervency; usual seasons, opportunities, duties, answer not this
   condition. To do no more than ordinary now is to do nothing at all. He
   that puts forth no more strength and activity for his deliverance when
   he is in depths, ready to perish, than he doth, or hath need to do,
   when he is at liberty in plain and smooth paths, is scarcely like to
   escape. Some in such conditions are careless and negligent; they think,
   in ordinary course, to wear off their distempers; and that, although at
   present they are sensible of their danger, they shall yet have peace at
   last: in which frame there is much contempt of God. Some despond and
   languish away under their pressures. Spiritual sloth influenceth both
   these sorts of persons. Let us see the frame under consideration
   exemplified in another. We have an instance in the spouse, Cant. iii.
   1-3. She had lost the presence of Christ, and so was in the very state
   and condition before described, verse 1. It was night with her, -- a
   time of darkness and disconsolation; and she seeks for her beloved: "By
   night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth." Christ was absent
   from her, and she was left unto depths and darkness upon that account;
   wherefore she seeks for him. But, as the most are apt to do in the like
   state and condition, she mends not her pace, goes not out of or beyond
   her course of ordinary duties, nor the frame she was usually in at
   other times. But what is the issue? Saith she, "I found him not." This
   is not a way to recover a sense of lost love, nor to get out of her
   entanglements. And this puts her on another course; she begins to think
   that if things continue in this estate she shall be undone." I go on,
   indeed, with the performance of duties still; but I have not the
   presence of my beloved, -- I meet not with Christ in them. My darkness
   and trouble abides still. If I take not some other course, I shall be
   lost." Well, saith she, "I will rise now," verse 2; -- "I will shake
   off all that case, and sloth, and customariness, that cleave to me."
   Some more lively, vigorous course must be fixed on. Resolutions for
   new, extraordinary, vigorous, constant applications unto God, are the
   first general step and degree of a sin-entangled soul acting towards a
   recovery. "I will rise now." And what doth she do when she is thus
   resolved? "I will," saith she, "go about the streets, and in the broad
   ways; and seek him whom my soul loveth;" -- "I will leave no ways or
   means unattempted whereby I may possibly come to a fresh enjoyment of
   him. If a man seek for a friend, he can look for him only in the
   streets, and in the broad ways, -- that is, either in towns, or in the
   fields. So will I do," saith the spouse. "In what way, ordinance, or
   institution soever, in or by what duty soever, public or private, of
   communion with others or solitary retiredness, Christ ever was or may
   be found, or peace obtained, I will seek him,' and not give over until
   I come to an enjoyment of him." And this frame, this resolution, a soul
   in depths must come unto, if ever it expect deliverance. For the most
   part, men's "wounds stink, and are corrupt, because of their
   foolishness," as the psalmist complains, Ps. xxxviii. 5. They are
   wounded by sin, and through spiritual sloth they neglect their cure;
   this weakens them, and disquiets them day by day: yet they endure all,
   rather than they will come out of their carnal ease, to deal
   effectually with God in an extraordinary manner. It was otherwise with
   David: Ps. xxii. 1, 2, "Why," saith he, "art thou so far from helping
   me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God, I cry in the daytime,
   and in the night season, and am not silent." What ails the man? Can he
   not be quiet night nor day? never silent, never hold his peace? And if
   he be somewhat disquieted, can he not contain himself, but that he must
   roar and cry out? Yea, must he "roar" thus "all the day long," as he
   speaks, Ps. xxxii. 3, and "groan all the night," as Ps. vi. 6? What is
   the matter, with all this roaring, sighing, tears, roaring all the day,
   all night long? Ah! let him alone, his soul is bitter in him; he is
   fallen into depths; the Lord is withdrawn from him; trouble is hard at
   hand; yea, he is full of anxiety on the account of sin; there is no
   quietness and soundness in him; and he must thus earnestly and
   restlessly apply himself for relief. Alas! what strangers, for the most
   part, are men now-a-days to this frame! How little of the workings of
   this spirit is found amongst us! And is not the reason of it, that we
   value the world more, and heaven and heavenly things less, than he did?
   that we can live at a better rate, without a sense of the love off God
   in Christ, than he could do? And is it not hence that we every day see
   so many withering professors, that have in a manner lost all communion
   with God, beyond a little lip-labour or talking; the filthy savour of
   whose wounds are offensive to all but themselves? And so will they go
   on, ready to die and perish, rather than with this holy man thus stir
   up themselves to meet the Lord. Heman was also like unto him, Ps.
   lxxxviii. 11, 12. What sense he had of his depths he declares, verse 3:
   "My soul," saith he, "is full of troubles; and my life draweth nigh
   unto the grave." And what, course doth he steer in this heavy,
   sorrowful, and disconsolate condition? Why, saith he, "O Lord God of my
   salvation, I have cried day and night before thee: let my prayer come
   before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry," verses 1, 2. Day and night
   he cries to the God of his salvation, and that with earnestness and
   importunity. This was his business, this was he exercised about all his
   days.

   This is that which is aimed at -- If a gracious soul be brought into
   the depths before mentioned and described, by reason of sin, when the
   Lord is pleased to lead him forth towards a recovery, he causeth him to
   be vigorous and restless in all the duties whereby he may make
   application to him for deliverance. Now, wherein this intenseness and
   earnestness of the soul, in its applications unto God, doth principally
   consist I shall briefly declare, when I have touched a little upon some
   considerations and grounds that stir it up thereunto:--

   (1.) The greatest of men's concernments may well put them on this
   earnestness. Men do not use to deal with dull and slothful spirits
   about their greatest concerns. David tells us that he was more
   concerned in the "light of God's countenance" than the men of the world
   could be in their "corn and wine," Ps. iv. 6, 7. Suppose a man of the
   world should have his house, wherein all his stock and riches are laid
   up, set on fire, and so the whole be in danger under his eye to be
   consumed, would he be calm and quiet in the consideration of it? Would
   he not bestir himself with all his might, and call in all the help he
   could obtain? and that because his portion, his all, his great
   concernment, lies at stake. And shall the soul be slothful, careless,
   dull, secure, when fire is put to its eternal concernments, -- when the
   light of God's countenance, which is of more esteem unto him than the
   greatest increase of corn and wine can be to the men of the world, is
   removed from him? It was an argument of prodigious security in Jonah,
   that he was fast asleep when the ship wherein he was was ready to be
   cast away for his sake. And will it be thought less in any soul, who,
   being in a storm of wrath and displeasure from God, sent out into the
   deep after him, shall neglect it, and sleep, as Solomon says, "on the
   top of a mast in the midst of the sea?" How did that poor creature,
   whose heart was mad on his idols, Judges xviii. 24, cry out when he was
   deprived of them! "Ye have taken away my gods," saith he, "and what
   have I more?" And shall a gracious soul lose his God through his own
   folly, -- the sense of his love, the consolation of his presence, --
   and not with all his might follow hard after him? Peace with God, joy
   in believing, such souls have formerly obtained. Can they live without
   them now in their ordinary walking? Can they choose but cry out with
   Job, "Oh that it were with us as in former days, when the candle of the
   Lord was upon our tabernacle?" chap xxix. 2-4; and with David, "O God,
   restore unto me the joy of thy salvation," Ps. li. 12, "for O my God, I
   remember former enjoyments, and my soul is cast down within me?" Ps.
   xlii. 6. They cannot live without it. But suppose they might make a
   sorry shift to pass on in their pilgrimage whilst all is smooth about
   them, what will they do in the time of outward trials and distresses,
   when deep calleth unto deep, and one trouble excites and sharpens
   another? Nothing then will support them, they know, but that which is
   wanting to them; as Hab. iii. 17, 18, Ps. xxiii. 4: so that the
   greatness of their concernment provokes them to the earnestness
   mentioned.

   (2.) They have a deep sense of these their great concernments. All men
   are equally concerned in the love of God and pardon of sin. Every one
   hath a soul of the same immortal constitution, equally capable of bliss
   and woe. But yet we see most men are so stupidly sottish, that they
   take little notice of these things. Neither the guilt of sin, nor the
   wrath of God, nor death, nor hell, are thought on or esteemed by them;
   they are their concernments, but they are not sensible of them. But
   gracious souls have a quick, living sense of spiritual things; for, --

   [1.] They have a saving spiritual fight, whereby they are able to
   discern the true nature of sin and the terror of the Lord: for though
   they are now supposed to have lost the comforting light of the Spirit,
   yet they never lose the sanctifying light of the Spirit, the light
   whereby they are enabled to discern spiritual things in a spiritual
   manner; this never utterly departs from them. By this they see sin to
   be "exceeding sinful," Rom. vii. 13. By this they know "the terror of
   the Lord," 2 Cor. v. 11; and that "it is a fearful thing to fall into
   the hands of the living God," Heb. x. 31. By this they discover the
   excellency of the love of God in Christ, which passeth knowledge, the
   present sense whereof they have lest. By this they are enabled to look
   within the vail, and to take a view of the blessed consolations which
   the saints enjoy whose communion with God was never interrupted. This
   represents to them all the sweetness, pleasure, joy, peace, which in
   former days they had, whilst God was present with them in love. By this
   are they taught to value all the fruits of the blood of Jesus Christ,
   of the enjoyment of many whereof they are at present cut short and
   deprived. All which, with other things of the like nature and
   importance, make them very sensible of their concernments.

   [2.] They remember what it cost them formerly to deal with God about
   sin; and hence they know it is no ordinary matter they have in hand.
   They must again to their old work, take the old cup into their hands
   again. A recovery from depths is as a new conversion.

   Ofttimes in it the whole work, as to the soul's apprehension, is gone
   over afresh. This the soul knows to have been a work of dread, terror,
   and trouble, and trembles in itself at its new trials. And, --

   [3.] The Holy Ghost gives unto poor souls a fresh sense of their deep
   concernments, on purpose that it may be a means to stir them up unto
   these earnest applications unto God. The whole work is his, and he
   carries it on by means suited to the compassing of the end he aimeth
   at; and by these means is a gracious soul brought into the frame
   mentioned. Now, there are sundry things that concur in and unto this
   frame:--

   1st. There is a continual thoughtfulness about the sad condition
   wherein the soul is in its depths. Being deeply affected with their
   condition, they are continually ruminating upon it, and pondering it in
   their minds. So David declares the case to have been with him: Ps.
   xxxviii. 2-6, 8, "Thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth
   me sore. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
   neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. For mine
   iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too
   heavy for me. My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my
   foolishness. I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all
   the day long. I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of
   the disquietness of my heart." Restlessness, deep thoughtfulness,
   disquietness of heart, continual heaviness of soul, sorrow and anxiety
   of mind, lie at the bottom of the applications we speak of. From these
   principles their prayers flow out; David adds, verse 9, "Lord, all my
   desire is before thee, and my groaning is not hid from thee." This way
   all his trouble wrought. He prayed out of the abundance of his
   meditation and grief. Thoughts of their state and condition lie down
   with such persons, and rise with them, and accompany them all the day
   long. As Reuben cried, "The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?"
   so doth such a soul; -- "The love of God is not, Christ is not; and I,
   whither shall I cause my sorrow to go? God is provoked, death is nigh
   at hand, relief is far away, darkness is about me. I have lost my
   peace, my joy, my song in the night. What do I think of duties? Can two
   walk together unless they be agreed? Can I walk with God in them,
   whilst I have thus made him mine enemy? What do I think of ordinances?
   Will it do me any good to be at Jerusalem, and not see the face of the
   King? to live under ordinances, and not to meet in them with the King
   of saints? May I not justly fear that the Lord will take his Holy
   Spirit from me until I be left without remedy?" With such thoughts as
   these are sin-entangled souls exercised, and they lie rolling in their
   minds in all their applications unto God.

   2dly. We see the application itself consists in and is made by the
   prayer of faith, or crying unto God. Now, this is done with intenseness
   of mind; which hath a twofold fruit or propriety, -- (1st.)
   Importunity; and, (2dly.) Constancy.

   It is said of our blessed Saviour, that when he was in his depths about
   our sins, "he offered up prayers and supplications, with strong cries
   and tears," Heb. v. 7." Strong cries and tears" express the utmost
   intension of spirit. And David expresseth it by "roaring," as we have
   seen before; as also by "sighing, groaning, and panting." A soul in
   such a condition lies down before the Lord with sighs, groans,
   mourning, cries, tears, and roaring, according to the various working
   of his heart, and its being affected with the things that it hath to
   do; and this produceth, --

   (1st.) Importunity. The power of the importunity of faith our Saviour
   hath marvellously set out, Luke xi. 5-10, as also, chap. xviii. 1.
   Importunate prayer is certainly prevailing; and importunity is, as it
   were, made up of these two things, -- frequency of interposition and
   variety of arguings. You shall have a man that is importunate come unto
   you seven times a-day about the same business; and after all, if any
   new thought come into his mind, though he had resolved to the contrary,
   he will come again. And there is nothing that can be imagined to relate
   unto the business he hath in hand but he will make use of it, and turn
   it to the furtherance of his plea. So is it in this case. Men will use
   both frequency of interposition and variety of arguings: Ps. lxxxvi. 3,
   "I cry unto thee daily," or rather, all the day. He had but that one
   business, and he attended it to the purpose. By this means we give God
   "no rest," Isa. lxii. 7; which is the very character of importunity.
   Such souls go to God; and they are not satisfied with what they have
   done, and they go again; and somewhat abideth still with them, and they
   go to him again; and the heart is not yet emptied, they will go again
   to him, that he may have no rest. What variety of arguments are pleaded
   with God in this case I could manifest in the same David; but it is
   known to all. There is not any thing almost that he makes not a plea
   of, -- the faithfulness, righteousness, name, mercy, goodness, and
   kindness of God in Jesus Christ; the concernment of others in him, both
   the friends and foes of God; his own weakness and helplessness, yea,
   the greatness of sin itself: "Be merciful to my sin," saith he, "for it
   is great." Sometimes he begins with some arguments of this kind; and
   then, being a little diverted by other considerations, some new plea is
   suggested unto him by the Spirit, and he returns immediately to his
   first employment and design; -- all arguing great intension of mind and
   spirit.

   (2dly.) Constancy also flows from intenseness. Such a soul will not
   give over until it obtain what it aims at and looks for; as we shall
   see in our process in opening this psalm.

   And this is in general the deportment of a gracious soul in the
   condition here represented unto us. As poor creatures love their peace,
   as they love their souls, as they tender the glory of God, they are not
   to be wanting in this duty. What is the reason that controversies hang
   so long between God and your souls, that it may be you scarce see a
   good day all your lives? Is it not, for the most part, from your sloth
   and despondency of spirit? You will not gird up the loins of your
   minds, in dealing with God, to put them to a speedy issue in the blood
   of Christ. You go on and off, begin and cease, try and give over; and,
   for the most part, though your case be extraordinary, content
   yourselves with ordinary and customary applications unto God. This
   makes you wither, become useless, and pine away in and under your
   perplexities. David did not so; but after many and many a breach made
   by sin, yet, through quick, vigorous, restless actings of faith, all
   was repaired, so that he lived peaceably, and died triumphantly. Up,
   then, and be doing; let not your "wounds corrupt because of your
   folly." Make thorough work of that which lies before you; be it long,
   or difficult, it is all one, it must be done, and is attended with
   safety. What you are like to meet withal in the first place shall
   nextly be declared.

                                  Verse third.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The words of the verse explained, and their meaning opened.

   The general frame of a gracious soul, in its perplexities about sin,
   hath been declared. Its particular actings, what it doth, what it meets
   withal, are nextly represented unto us.

   First, then, in particular, it cries out, "If thou, Lord, shouldest
   mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?"

   There is in the words a supposition, and an inference on that
   supposition. In the supposition there is, -- 1. The name of God, that
   is fixed on as suited unto it; and, 2. The thing itself supposed. In
   the inference there is expressed the matter of it, to "stand;" and the
   manner of its proposal, wherein two things occur -- 1. That it is
   expressed by way of interrogation. 2. The indefiniteness of that
   interrogation, "Who shall stand?"

   "If thou, Lord." He here fixes on another name of God, which is Jah; --
   a name, though from the same root with the former, yet seldom used but
   to intimate and express the terrible majesty of God: "He rideth on the
   heavens, and is extolled by his name Jah," Ps. lxviii. 4. He is to deal
   now with God about the guilt of sin; and God is represented to the soul
   as great and terrible, that he may know what to expect and look for, if
   the matter must be tried out according to the demerit of sin.

   What, then, saith he to Jah? 'mvnvt tsmr?, -- "If thou shouldest mark
   iniquities." smr? is to observe and keep as in safe custody; to keep,
   preserve, and watch diligently; so to remark and observe, as to retain
   that which is observed, to ponder it, and lay it up in the heart. Gen.
   xxxvii. 11, Jacob "observed" Joseph's dream; that is, he retained the
   memory of it, and pondered it in his heart.

   The marking of iniquities, then, here intended, is God's so far
   considering and observing of them as to reserve them for punishment and
   vengeance. In opposition unto this marking, he is said not to see sin,
   to overlook it, to cover it, or remember it no more; that is, to
   forgive it, as the next verse declares.

   I need not show that God so far marks all sins in all persons as to see
   them, know them, disallow them, and to be displeased with them. This
   cannot be denied without taking away of all grounds of fear and
   worship. To deny it is all one as to deny the very being of God; deny
   his holiness and righteousness, and you deny his existence. But there
   is a day appointed, wherein all the men of the world shall know that
   God knew and took notice of all and every one of their most secret
   sins. There is, then, a double marking of sin in God; neither of which
   can be denied in reference unto any sins, in any persons. The first is
   physical, consisting in his omniscience, whereunto all things are open
   and naked. Thus no sin is hid from him; the secretest are before the
   light of his countenance. All are marked by him. Secondly, moral, in a
   displicency with or displeasure against every sin; which is inseparable
   from the nature of God, upon the account of his holiness. And this is
   declared in the sentence of the law, and that equally to all men in the
   world. But the marking here intended is that which is in a tendency to
   animadversion and punishment, according to the tenor of the law. Not
   only the sentence of the law, but a will of punishing according to it,
   is included in it." If," saith the psalmist, "thou, the great and
   dreadful God, who art extolled by the glorious name Jah, shouldst take
   notice of iniquities, so as to recompense sinners that come unto thee
   according to the severity and exigence of thy holy law;" -- what then?
   It is answered by the matter of the proposal, "Who can stand?" that is,
   none can so do. To gar tis entautha oudeis estin, says Chrysostom. This
   "who," is none; no man; not one in the world. my ymd?, "Quis stabit?"
   or "consistet," -- "Who can stand?" or abide and endure the trial?
   Every one on this supposition must perish, and that eternally. This the
   desert of sin, and the curse of the law, which is the rule of this
   marking of their iniquity, doth require. And there is a notable
   emphasis in the interrogation, which contains the manner of the
   inference." Who can stand?" is more than if he had said, "None can
   abide the trial, and escape without everlasting ruin;" for the
   interrogation is indefinite; not, "How can I?" but," Who can stand?,"
   When the Holy Ghost would set out the certainty and dreadfulness of the
   perishing of ungodly men, he doth it by such a kind of expression,
   wherein there is a deeper sense intimated into the minds of men than
   any words can well clothe or declare: 1 Pet. iv. 17, "What shall the
   end be of them that obey not the gospels." and verse 18, "Where shall
   the ungodly and the sinner appears." So here, "Who can stand?" There is
   a deep insinuation of a dreadful ruin as unto all with whom God shall
   so deal as to mark their iniquities. See Ps. i. 5.

   The psalmist then addressing himself to deal with God about sin, lays
   down in the first place, in the general, how things must go, not with
   himself only, but with all the world, upon the supposition he had
   fixed: "This is not my case only; but it is so with all mankind, every
   one who is partaker of flesh and blood. Whether their guilt answer that
   which I am oppressed withal or no, all is one; guilty they are all, and
   all must perish. How much more must that needs be my condition, who
   have contracted so great a guilt as I have done!" Here, then, he lays a
   great argument against himself, on the supposition before laid down:
   "If none, the holiest, the humblest, the most believing soul, can abide
   the trial, can endure; how much less can I, who am the chiefest of
   sinners, the least of saints, who come unspeakably behind them in
   holiness, and have equally gone beyond them in sin!"

   This is the sense and importance of the words. Let us now consider how
   they are expressive of the actings of the soul whose state and
   condition is here represented unto us, and what directions they will
   afford unto us, to give unto them who are fallen into the same state.
     __________________________________________________________________

   What first presents itself to a soul in distress on the account of sin
   -- This opened in four propositions -- Thoughts of God's marking sin
   according to the tenor of the law full of dread and terror.

   What depths the psalmist was in hath been declared; in them what
   resolution he takes upon himself to seek God alone for relief and
   recovery hath been also showed; and what earnestness in general he
   useth therein. Addressing himself unto God in that frame, with that
   purpose and resolution, the first thing he fixeth on in particular is
   the greatness of his sin and guilt, according to the tenor of the law.
   It appears, then, that, --

   First, In a sin-perplexed soul's addresses unto God, the first thing
   that presents itself unto him is God's marking sin according to the
   tenor of the law. The case is the same in this matter with all sorts of
   sinners, whether before conversion or in relapses and entanglements
   after conversion. There is a proportion between conversion and
   recoveries. They are both wrought by the same means and ways, and have
   both the same effects upon the souls of sinners, although in sundry
   things they differ, not now to be spoken unto. What, then, is spoken on
   this head may be applied unto both sorts, -- to them that are yet
   unconverted, and to them who are really delivered from their state and
   condition; but especially unto those who know not whether state they
   belong unto, that is, to all guilty souls. The law will put in its
   claim to all. It will condemn the sin, and try what it can do against
   the sinner. There is no shaking of it off; it must be fairly answered,
   or it will prevail. The law issues out an arrest for the debt; and it
   is to no purpose to bid the sergeant be gone, or to entreat him to
   spare. If payment be not procured, and an acquaintance produced, the
   soul must to prison." I am going unto God," saith the soul; "he is
   great and terrible, a marker of sin, and what shall I say unto him?"
   This makes him tremble, and cry out, "O Lord, who shall stand?" So that
   it appears hence that, --

   Secondly, Serious thoughts of God's marking sin according to the tenor
   of the law is a thing full of dread and terror to the soul of a sinner.
   But this is not all; he is not swallowed up in this amazement, crying
   out only, "Who can stand?" There is included in the words a thorough,
   sincere acknowledgment of his own sin and the guilt thereof. Mentioning
   the desert of sin, in his own case, he acknowledgeth his own. So that,
   --

   Thirdly, Sincere sense and acknowledgment for sin, with
   self-condemnation in the justification of God, is the first peculiar,
   especial working of a gracious soul rising out of its entanglements.
   All this is included in these words. He acknowledgeth both his own
   guilt and the righteousness of God if he should deal with him according
   to the demerit of sin.

   And these things lie in the words absolutely considered. But the state
   of the soul here represented carries us on farther. He rests not here,
   as we shall see in the opening of the next verse, the chief thing aimed
   at in the whole. And as a transition from the one to the other, that we
   may still carry on the general design at the entrance laid down, we
   must take along with us this farther observation:--

   Fourthly, Though self-condemnation be an eminent preparation for the
   discovery of forgiveness in God, yet a poor distressed soul is not to
   rest in it, nor to rest upon it, but to pass on to the embracing of
   forgiveness itself.

   There is yet a general proposition lying in the words that we may make
   use of in our passage, and it is this:-- God's marking of iniquities
   and man's salvation are everlastingly inconsistent. I mean his marking
   them in the persons of sinners for the ends before mentioned.

   Of some of these I shall farther treat, according as the handling of
   them conduceth to the purpose in hand.

   That which I shall begin withal is that which was first laid down,
   about the effects of serious thoughts concerning God's marking sin
   according to the tenor of the law; which, as I said, is the first thing
   that presents itself unto a sin-entangled soul in its addresses unto
   God.

   But this shall not pass alone. I shall draw the two first observations
   into one, and make use of the first only in the confirmation of the
   other; which will express the sense of the words absolutely considered.
   The third and fourth will lead us on in the progress of the soul
   towards the relief sought after and proposed. That, therefore, which is
   to be first insisted on comes up to this proposition:--

   In a sin-perplexed soul's addresses unto God, the first thing that
   presents itself unto him is God's marking of sin according to the tenor
   of the law; which of itself is apt to fill the soul with dread and
   terror.

   I shall first somewhat speak unto it in this, as considered in itself,
   and then inquire into the concernment of the soul in it, whose
   condition is here described.

   The Lord speaks of some who, when they hear the word of the curse, yet
   "bless themselves," and say they shall have "peace," Deut. xxix. 19.
   Let men preach and say what they will of the terror of the Lord, they
   will despise it; which God threatens with utter extermination. And he
   notes it again as an amazing wickedness, and the height of
   obdurateness, Jer. xxxvi. 24. Generally it is with sinners as it was
   with Gaal the son of Ebed, Judges ix., when he was fortifying of Sichem
   against Abimelech. Zebul tells him that Abimelech will come and destroy
   him." Let him come," saith Gaal, "I shall deal well enough with him.
   Let him bring forth his army; I fear him not." But upon the very first
   appearance of Abimelech's army he trembled for fear, verse 36. Tell
   obdurate sinners of the wrath of God, and that he will come to plead
   his cause against them; for the most part they take no notice of what
   you say, nor have any serious thoughts about it, but go on as if they
   were resolved they should deal well enough with him. Notwithstanding
   all their stoutness, a day is coming wherein fearfulness shall surprise
   them, and make them cry out, "Who among us shall dwell with devouring
   fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?" Yea, if the
   Lord be pleased in this life, in an especial manner, to draw nigh to
   any of them, they quickly see that their "hearts cannot endure, nor can
   their hands be strong," Ezek. xxii. 14. Their hands hang down, and
   their stout hearts tremble like an aspen leaf.

   He who first sinned, and had first occasion to have serious thoughts
   about God's marking of sin, gives us a notable instance of what we have
   affirmed; and the first in every kind is the measure of all that
   follows in the same kind. Gen. iii. 8, "He heard the voice of the Lord
   God;" so he had done before without the least trouble or consternation
   of spirit. He was made for communion with God; and that he might hear
   his voice was part of his blessedness. But now saith he, "I heard thy
   voice and was afraid, and hid myself." He knew that God was coming on
   the inquest of sin, and he was not able to bear the thoughts of meeting
   him. Could he have gone into the bowels of the earth from whence he was
   taken, and have been there hid from God, he would not have failed to
   have attempted it. Things are now altered with him. In that God whom he
   loved before as a good, holy, powerful, righteous Creator, Preserver,
   Benefactor, and Rewarder, he saw nothing now but wrath, indignation,
   vengeance, and terror. This makes him tremble out those dreadful words,
   "I heard thy voice and was afraid, and hid myself."

   The giving out of the law afterwards evinces what effects the
   consideration of God's proceeding with sinners according to the tenor
   of it must needs produce: Exod. xx. 18, 19, "All the people saw the
   thunderings and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the
   mountain smoking;" as the apostle also describes it, Heb. xii. 18. In
   this manner came forth from the Lord that "fiery law," Deut. xxxiii. 2;
   so that all who are concerned in it "did exceedingly quake and
   tremble." And yet all this respects but the severity of the law in
   general, without the application of it unto any soul in particular.
   There is a solemnity that carrieth an awe with it in the preparation of
   an assize to be kept and held by poor worms like ourselves; but the
   dread of it is peculiar to the malefactors for whose trial and
   execution all this preparation is made. When a soul comes to think that
   all this dreadful preparation, this appearance of terrible majesty,
   these streams of the fiery law, are all pointed towards him, it will
   make him cry out, "Lord, who can stand?" And this law is still in force
   towards sinners, even as it was on the day wherein it was given on
   mount Sinai. Though Moses grew old, yet his strength never failed; nor
   hath his law, the law given by him, lost any thing of its strength,
   power, or authority towards sinners. It is still accompanied with
   thunderings and lightnings, as of old; and it will not fall to
   represent the terror of the Lord to a guilty soul.

   Among the saints themselves I could produce instances to manifest that
   they have found it to be thus. The cases of Job, David, Heman are
   known. I shall only consider it in Christ himself. From himself he had
   no occasion of any discouraging thought, being holy, harmless,
   undefiled. He fulfilled all righteousness, did his Father's will in all
   things, and abode in his love. This must needs be attended with the
   highest peace and most blessed joy. In the very entrance of his trials,
   he had a full persuasion of a comfortable issue and success; as we may
   see, Isa. i. 7-9. But yet when his soul was exercised with thoughts of
   God's marking our iniquities upon him, it was "sorrowful unto death."
   He was "sore amazed, and very heavy," Mark xiv. 33, 34. His agony; his
   blood-sweat; his strong cries and supplications; his reiterated
   prayers, "If it be possible let this cup pass from me;" his last and
   dreadful cry, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" -- all
   manifest what apprehensions he had of what it was for God to mark
   iniquities. Well may poor sinners cry out, "Lord, who shall stand?"
   when the Son of God himself so trembled under the weight of it.

   In serious thoughts of God's marking sin, he is represented unto the
   soul under all those glorious, terrible attributes and excellencies
   which axe apt to beget a dread and terror in the hearts of sinners,
   when they have no relief from any covenant engagements in Christ. The
   soul looks upon him as the great lawgiver, James iv. 12, -- able to
   revenge the breach of it, by destroying body and soul in hell fire; as
   one terrible in holiness, of purer eyes than to behold iniquity; so
   also in greatness and in power; the living God, into whose hands it is
   a fearful thing to fall; as attended with vindictive justice, saying,
   "Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense," Heb. x. 30. Now, for
   a soul to consider God, clothed with all these dreadful and terrible
   excellencies, coming to deal with sinners according to the tenor of his
   fiery law, it cannot but make him cry out, with Moses, "I exceedingly
   fear and quake."

   These things work on their minds the conclusion mentioned before, as
   asserted in these words, -- namely, that God's marking of sin according
   to the tenor of the law, and man's salvation, are utterly inconsistent;
   a conclusion that must needs shake a soul when pressed under a sense of
   its own guilt.

   When a person who is really guilty, and knows himself to be guilty, is
   brought unto his trial, he hath but these four grounds of hope that his
   safety and his trial may be consistent. He may think that either, -- 1.
   The judge will not be able to find out or discover his crimes; or, 2.
   That some one will powerfully intercede for him with the judge; or, 3.
   That the rule of the law is not so strict as to take notice of his
   miscarriages; or, 4. That the penalty of it is not so severe but that
   there may be a way of escape. Cut him short of his expectations from
   some, one, or all of these, and all his hopes must of necessity perish.
   And how is it in this case?

   1. Of the Judge we have spoken somewhat already. The present inquiry
   is, Whether any thing may be hid from him or no, and so a door of
   escape be opened to a sinner? The apostle tells us that "all things are
   naked and open unto him," Heb. iv. 13; and the psalmist, that "there is
   not a thought in our hearts, nor a word in our tongue, but he
   understandeth it afar off, and knoweth it altogether," Ps. cxxxix. 2-4.
   What the sinner knows of himself that may cause him to fear, that God
   knows; and what he knows not of himself that deserves his fear, that
   God knows also: "He is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all
   things," 1 John iii. 20. When God shall not only set in order before
   the sinner the secret sins which he retains some remembrance of, but
   also brings to mind and represents unto him that world of filth and
   folly which either he never took any real notice of or hath utterly
   forgotten, it will trouble him, yea, confound him.

   2. But may not this Judge be entreated to pass by what he knows, and to
   deal favourably with the sinner? May not an intercessor be obtained to
   plead in the behalf of the guilty soul? Eli determines this matter, 1
   Sam. ii. 25, "If one man sin against smother, the judge shall judge
   him; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him?"
   "There is not," saith Job, "between us mvkych?, one that might argue
   the case, in pleading for me, and so make up the matter, laying his
   hand upon us both,'?" chap. ix. 33. We now consider a sinner purely
   under the administration of the law, which knows nothing of a mediator.
   In that case, who shall take upon him to intercede for the sinner?
   Besides that all creatures in heaven and earth are engaged in the
   quarrel of God against sinners, and besides the greatness and terror of
   his majesty, that will certainly deter all or any of them from
   undertaking any such work, what is the request that in this case must
   be put up unto God? Is it not that he would cease to be holy, leave off
   from being righteous, relinquish his throne, deny himself and his
   sovereignty, that a rebel, a traitor, his cursed enemy, may live and
   escape his justice? Is this request reasonable? Is he fit to intercede
   for sinners that make it? Would he not by so doing prove himself to be
   the greatest of them? The sinner cannot, then, expect any door of
   escape to be opened unto him; all the world is against him; and the
   case must be tried out nakedly between God and him. But, --

   3. It may be the rule of the law whereby the sinner is to be tried is
   not so strict, but that, in the case of such sins as he is guilty of,
   it may admit of a favourable interpretation; or that the good that he
   hath done may be laid in the balance against his evil, and so some
   relief be obtained that way. But the matter is quite otherwise. There
   is no good action of a sinner, though it were perfectly good, that can
   lie in the balance with, or compensate the evil of, the least sin
   committed; for all good is due on another account, though no guilt were
   incurred. And the payment of money that a man ewes, that he hath
   borrowed, makes no satisfaction for what he hath stole; no more will
   our duties compensate for our sins. Nor is there any good action of a
   sinner but it hath evil and guilt enough attending it to render itself
   unacceptable; so that men may well cease from thoughts of their
   supererogation. Besides, where there is any one sin, if all the good in
   the world might be supposed to be in the same person, yet, in the
   indispensable order of our dependence on God, nothing of that good
   could come into consideration until the guilt of that sin were answered
   for unto the utmost. Now, the penalty of every sin being the eternal
   ruin of the sinner, all his supposed good can stand him in little
   stead. And for the law itself, it is an issue of the holiness,
   righteousness, and wisdom of God; so that there is not any evil so
   great or small but is forbidden in it, and condemned by it. Hereupon
   David so states this whole matter, Ps. cxliii. 2, "Enter not into
   judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living be
   justified;" -- that is, if things are to be tried out and determined by
   the law, no sinner can obtain acquitment; as Paul declares the sense of
   that place to be, Rom. iii. 20, Gal. ii. 16. But yet, --

   4. It may be the sentence of the law is not so fierce and dreadful, but
   that, though guilt be found, there may be yet a way of escape. But the
   law speaks not one word on this side death to an offender. There is a
   greatness and an eternity of wrath in the sentence of it; and it is God
   himself who hath undertaken to see the vengeance of it executed. So
   that, on all these accounts, the conclusion mentioned must needs be
   fixed in the soul of a sinner that entertains thoughts of drawing nigh
   to God.

   Though what hath been spoken may be of general use unto sinners of all
   sorts, whether called home to God or yet strangers to him, yet I shall
   not insist upon any general improvement of it, because it is intended
   only for one special end or purpose. That which is aimed at is, to show
   what are the first thoughts that arise in the heart of a poor entangled
   soul, when first he begins to endeavour a recovery in a returnal unto
   God. The law immediately puts in its claim unto him and against him; --
   God is represented unto him as angry, displeased, provoked; and his
   terror more or less besets him round about. This fills him with fear,
   shame, and confusion of face; so that he knows not what to do. These
   troubles are greater or lesser, according as God seeth it best for the
   poor creature's present humiliation and future safety. What, then, doth
   the sinner? what are his thoughts hereupon? Doth he think to fly from
   God, and to give over all endeavours of recovery? Doth he say, "This
   God is a holy and terrible God; I cannot serve him; it is to no purpose
   for me to look for any thing but fury and destruction from him: and
   therefore I had as good give over as persist in my design of drawing
   nigh to him?" It cannot be denied but that in this case thoughts of
   this nature will be suggested by unbelief, and that sometimes great
   perplexities arise to the soul by them: but this is not the issue and
   final product of this exercise of the soul; it produceth another
   effect; it calls for that which is the first particular working of a
   gracious soul arising out of its sin-entanglements. This is, as was
   declared, a sincere sense of sin, and acknowledgment of it, with
   self-condemnation in the justification of God; this is the first thing
   that a soul endeavouring a recovery from its depths is brought and
   wrought unto. His general resolution, to make serious and thorough work
   with what he hath in hand, was before unfolded. That which, in the next
   place, we are directed unto in these words is, the reflection on
   itself, upon the consideration of God's marking iniquity, now
   mentioned. This is faith's great and proper use of the law; the nature
   whereof shall be farther opened in the next discourse.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The first particular actings of a soul towards a recovery out of the
   depths of sin -- Sense of sin, wherein it consists, how it is wrought
   -- Acknowledgment of sin; its nature and properties --
   Self-condemnation.

   What is the frame of the soul in general that is excited by grace, and
   resolves in the strength thereof to attempt a recovery out of the
   depths of sin-entanglements, hath been declared. We have also showed
   what entertainments, in general, such a soul had need to expect, yea,
   ordinarily shall be sure to meet withal. It may be he goes forth at
   first like Samson with his locks cut, and thinks he will do as at other
   times; but he quickly finds his peace lost, his wounds painful, his
   conscience restless, God displeased, and his whole condition, as the
   utmost of his own apprehension, hazardous. This fills him with the
   thoughts expressed in this third verse, and fixes the conclusion in his
   mind discoursed of before. He finds now that he hath the law afresh to
   deal withal. Thence ariseth that sense and acknowledgment of sin, that
   self-condemnation in the justification of God, whereof we now speak. He
   grows not sullen, stubborn, displeased, and so runs away from God; he
   doth not "utterly faint," despond, and give over, he pleads not any
   thing in his own justification or for the extenuation of his sin and
   guilt; he quarrelleth not with, he repineth not against, the holiness,
   severity, and righteousness of the law of God; but reflects wholly on
   himself, his own unworthiness, guilt, and desert, and in a sense of
   them lies down at the foot of God, in expectation of his word and
   sentence.

   Three things in this condition we ascribe unto such a soul:--

   First, A sincere sense of sin. There is a twofold sense of sin. The one
   is general and notional; whereby a man knows what sin is, that himself
   is a sinner, -- that he is guilty of this or that, these or those sins;
   only his heart is not affected proportionably to that discovery and
   knowledge which he hath of these things. The other is active and
   efficacious. The soul being acquainted with the nature of sin, with its
   own guilt in reference unto sin in general, as also to this or that
   sin, is universally influenced by that apprehension unto suitable
   affections and operations.

   Of both these we have an instance in the same person. David, before
   Nathan's coming to him, had the former; afterwards he had the latter
   also. It cannot be imagined but that, before the coming of the prophet,
   he had a general knowledge and sense, not only absolutely of the nature
   of sin, but also that himself was a sinner, and guilty of those very
   sins which afterward he was reproved for. To think otherwise is to
   suppose not only that he was unsainted, but unmanned also and turned
   into a beast. But yet this wrought not in him any one affection
   suitable to his condition. And the like may be said of most sinners in
   the world. But now, when Nathan comes to him, and gives him the latter
   efficacious sense whereof we speak, we know what effects it did
   produce.

   It is the latter only that is under consideration; and that also is
   twofold -- 1. Legal, or antecedaneous unto conversion; 2. Evangelical,
   and previous to the recovery from depths, whereof we treat. How these
   two differ, and how they may be discerned one from the other, being
   both of them in their kind sincere, is not my business to declare.

   Now, this last, which we assign as the first duty, work, or acting of a
   returning soul, is a deep and practical apprehension, wrought in the
   mind and heart of a believing sinner by the Holy Ghost, of sin and its
   evils, in reference unto the law and love of God, the cross and blood
   of Christ, the communion and consolation of the Spirit, and all the
   fruits of love, mercy, or grace that it hath been made partaker of, or
   on gospel ground hoped for.

   1. The principal efficient cause of it is the Holy Ghost. He it is who
   "convinceth of sin," John xvi. 8. He works indeed by means, -- he
   wrought it in David by the ministry of Nathan, and he wrought it in
   Peter by the look of Christ, -- but his work it is; no man can work
   upon his own soul. It will not spring out of men's rational
   considerations. Though men may exercise their thoughts about such
   things, as one would think were enough to break the heart of stones,
   yet if the Holy Ghost put not forth a peculiar efficacy of his own,
   this sense of sin will not be wrought or produced. As the waters at the
   pool of Bethesda were not troubled but when an angel descended and
   moved them, no more will the heart for sin without a saving illapse of
   the Holy Ghost.

   2. It is deep apprehension of sin and the evils of it. Slight,
   transient thoughts about them amount not to the sense of which we
   speak." My sorrow," saith David, "is continually before me," Ps.
   xxxviii. 17. It pressed him always and greatly. Hence he compares this
   sense of sin wrought by the Holy Ghost to "arrows that stick in the
   flesh," verse 2; they pain sorely and are always perplexing. Sin, in
   this sense of it, lays hold on the soul, so that the sinner cannot look
   up, Ps. xl. 12; and it abides with him, making "his sore run in the
   night without ceasing," Ps. lxxvii. 2, and depriveth the soul of rest."
   My soul," saith he, "refused to be comforted." This apprehension of sin
   lies down and rises with him in whom it is. Transient thoughts,
   attended with infrequent sighs and ejaculations, little become a
   returning soul. And, --

   3. It is practical. It is not seated only in the speculative part of
   the mind, hovering in general notions, but it dwells in the practical
   understanding, which effectually influenceth the will and affections,
   -- such an apprehension as from which sorrow and humiliation are
   inseparable. The acts of the practical understanding do so necessarily
   produce together with them suitable acts of the will and affections,
   that some have concluded that those are indeed proper acts of the will
   which are usually ascribed to the understanding. It is so in the mind
   as that the whole soul is cast into the mould and likeness of it;
   humiliation, sorrow, self-abhorrency, do live and die with it.

   4. (1.) It hath, in the first place, respect unto the law of God. There
   can be no due consideration of sin wherein the law hath not its place.
   The law calls for the sinner, and he willingly gives up his sin to be
   judged by it. There he sees it to be "exceeding sinful," Rom. vii. 13.
   Though a believer be less under the power of the law than others, yet
   he knows more of the authority and nature of it than others; he sees
   more of its spirituality and holiness. And the more a man sees of the
   excellency of the law, the more he sees of the vileness of sin. This is
   done by a soul in its first endeavour of a recovery from the
   entanglements of sin. He labours thoroughly to know his disease, that
   he may be cured. It will do him no good, he knows, to be ignorant of
   his distemper or his danger. He knows that if his wounds be not
   searched to the bottom, they will stink and be corrupt. To the law,
   then, he brings himself and his sin. By that he sees the vileness of
   the one and the danger of the other. Most men lie still in their
   depths, because they would willingly escape the first step of their
   rising. From the bottom of their misery, they would fain at once be at
   the top of their felicity. The soul managed in this work by the Holy
   Ghost doth not so. He converseth with the law, brings his sin unto it,
   and fully hears the sentence of it. When the sin is thoroughly
   condemned, then he farther takes care of the sinner. As ever you desire
   to come to rest, avoid not this entrance of your passion unto it. Weigh
   it well, and attend unto what the law speaks of your sin and its
   desert, or you will never make a due application to God for
   forgiveness. As ever you would have your souls justified by grace, take
   care to have your sins judged by the law.

   (2.) There is a respect in it to the love of God; and this breaks the
   heart of the poor returning sinner. Sorrow from the law shuts itself up
   in the soul, and strangleth it. Sorrow from the thoughts of the love of
   God opens it, and causeth it to flow forth. Thoughts of sinning against
   the love of God, managed by the Holy Ghost; -- what shall I say? their
   effects in the heart are not to be expressed. This made Ezra cry out,
   "O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee," chap.
   ix. 6; and verse 10, "What shall we say after this?" After what? Why,
   all the fruits of love and kindness they had been made partakers of.
   Thoughts of love and sin laid together make the soul blush, mourn, be
   ashamed, and confounded in itself. So Ezek. xxxvi. 31, "Then shall ye
   remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good." When
   shall they do so? When thoughts and apprehensions of love shall be
   brought home to them; and, saith he, "Then shall ye lothe yourselves in
   your own sight." The soul now calls to mind what love, what kindness,
   and what mercy, what grace, what patience hath been exercised towards
   it, and whereof it hath been made partaker. The thoughts of all these
   now come in upon him as streams of water. Such mercy, such communion,
   such privileges, such hopes of glory, such tastes of heaven, such
   peace, such consolation, such joy, such communications of the Spirit,
   -- all to a poor, wretched, cursed, lost, forlorn sinner; and all this
   despised, neglected! the God of them all provoked, forsaken! "Ah,"
   saith the soul, "whither shall I cause my sorrow to go?" This fills him
   with shame and confusion of face, makes him mourn in secret, and sigh
   to the breaking of the loins. And then, --

   (3.) The blood and cross of Christ is also brought to remembrance by
   the Holy Ghost. "Ah," saith the soul, "have I thus requited the
   wonderful, astonishing love of my Redeemer? Is this the return, the
   requital, I have made unto him? Are not heaven and earth astonished at
   the despising of that love, at which they are astonished?" This brake
   Peter's heart upon the look of Christ. Such words as these from Christ
   will, in this condition, sound in the ears of the soul: "Did I love
   thee, and leave my glory to become a scorn and reproach for thy sake?
   Did I think my life, and all that was dear unto me, too good for thee,
   to save thee from the wrath to come? Have I been a wilderness unto
   thee, or a land of darkness? What could I have done more for thee? When
   I had nothing left but my life, blood, and soul, they went all for
   thee, that thou mightst live by my death, be washed in my blood, and be
   saved through my soul's being made an offering for thee! And hast thou
   thus requited my love, to prefer a lust before me, or by mere sloth and
   folly to be turned away from me? Go, unkind and unthankful soul, and
   see if thou canst find another Redeemer." This overwhelms the soul, and
   even drowns it in tears of sorrow. And then the bitterness also of the
   sufferings of Christ are Brought to mind: "They look on him whom they
   have pierced, and mourn," Zech. xii. 10. They remember his gall and
   wormwood, his cry and tears, his agony and sweat, his desertion and
   anguish, his blood and death, the sharpness of the sword that was in
   his soul, and the bitterness of the cup that was put into his hand.
   Such a soul now looks on Christ, bleeding, dying, wrestling with wrath
   and curse for him, and seeth his sin in the streams of blood that
   issued from his side. And all this increaseth that sense of sin whereof
   we speak. Also, --

   (4.) It relates to the communion and consolations of the Holy Ghost,
   with all the privileges and fruits of love we are by him made partakers
   of. The Spirit is given to believers, upon the promise of Christ, to
   dwell in them. He takes up their hearts to be his dwelling-place. To
   what ends and purposes? That he may purify and sanctify them, make them
   holy, and dedicate them to God; to furnish them with grace and gifts;
   to interest them in privileges; to guide, lead, direct, comfort them;
   to seal them unto the day of redemption. Now, this Spirit is grieved by
   sin, Eph. iv. 30, and his dwelling-place defiled thereby, 1 Cor. vi.
   19, iii. 17. Thoughts hereof greatly sharpen the spiritual sense of sin
   in a recovering soul. He considers what light, what love, what joy,
   what consolation, what privileges, it hath by him been made partaker
   of; what motions, warnings, workings to keep it from sin, it hath found
   from him; and says within itself, "What have I done? whom have I
   grieved, whom have I provoked? What if the Lord should now, for my
   folly and ingratitude, utterly take his Holy Spirit from me? What if I
   should have so grieved him that he will dwell in me no more, delight in
   me no more? What dismal darkness and disconsolation, yea, what utter
   ruin should I be left unto! However, what shame and confusion of face
   belongs to me for my wretched disingenuity and ingratitude towards
   him!"

   This is the First thing that appears in the returning soul's actings
   and frame, -- a sincere sense of sin on the account mentioned, wrought
   in it by the Holy Ghost. And this a soul in the depths described must
   come unto, if ever it expects or looks for deliverance and a recovery.
   Let not such persons expect to have a renewed sense of mercy without a
   revived sense of sin.

   Secondly. From hence proceedeth an ingenuous, free, gracious
   acknowledgment of sin. Men may have a sense of sin, and yet suffer it
   to lie burning as a fire shut up in their bones, to their continual
   disquietment, and not he able to come off unto a free, soul-opening
   acknowledgment; yea, confession may be made in general, and mention
   therein of that very sin wherewith the soul is most entangled, and yet
   the soul come short of a due performance of this duty. Consider how the
   case stood with David: Ps. xxxii. 3, "When I kept silence, my bones
   waxed old through my roaring all the day long." How could David keep
   silence, and yet roar all the day long? What is that silence which is
   consistent with roaring? It is a mere negation of that duty which is
   expressed, verse 5, that is intended: "I acknowledged my sin unto thee,
   and mine iniquity have I not hid." It was not a silence of submission
   and waiting on God that he intends; that would not have produced a
   wasting of his spiritual strength, as he complains this silence did:
   "My bones waxed old." Nor yet was it a sullen, stubborn, and
   contumacious frame that was upon him; but he notes, saith Calvin (and
   he says well), "Affectum qui medius est inter tolerantiam et
   contumaciam, vitio et virtuti affinis;" -- "An affection between
   patience and stubbornness, bordering on the one and other." That is, he
   had a deep sense of sin; this disquieted and perplexed him all the day
   long; which he calls his roaring. It weakened and wearied him, making
   his bones wax old, or his strength decay; yet was he not able to bring
   his heart to that ingenuous, gracious acknowledgment which, like the
   lancing of a festered wound, would have given at least some ease to his
   soul. God's children are ofttimes in this matter like ours. Though they
   are convinced of a fault, and are really troubled at it, yet they will
   hardly acknowledge it. So do they. They will go up and down, sigh and
   mourn, roar all the day long; but an evil and untoward frame of spirit,
   under the power of unbelief and fear, keeps them from this duty.

   Now, that this acknowledgment may be acceptable unto God, it is
   required, first, that it be free; then, that it be full.

   1. It must be free, and spiritually ingenuous. Cain, Pharaoh, Ahab,
   Judas, came all to an acknowledgment of sin; but it was whether they
   would or no. It was pressed out of them; it did not flow from them. The
   confession of a person under the convincing terrors of the law or dread
   of imminent judgments is like that of malefactors on the rack, who
   speak out that for which themselves and friends must die. What they
   say, though it be the truth, is a fruit of force and torture, not of
   any ingenuity of mind. So is it with merely convinced persona They come
   not to the acknowledgment of sin with any more freedom. And the reason
   is, because all sin hath shame; and for men to be free unto shame is
   naturally impossible, shame being nature's shrinking from itself and
   the posture it would appear in. But now the returning soul hath never
   more freedom, liberty, and aptitude of spirit, than when he is in the
   acknowledgment of those things whereof he is most ashamed. And this is
   no small evidence that it proceeds from that Spirit which is attended
   with that liberty; for "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
   liberty," 2 Cor. iii. 17. When David was delivered from his silence, he
   expresseth this frame in the performance of his duty: Ps. xxxii. 5, "I
   acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
   said, I will confess my transgressions." His mouth is now open, and his
   heart enlarged, and he multiplies one expression upon another to
   manifest his enlargement. So doth a soul rising out of its depths, in
   this beginning of this address unto God. Having the sense of sin before
   described wrought in him by the Holy Ghost, his heart is made free, and
   enlarged unto an ingenuous acknowledgment of his sin before the Lord.
   Herein he pours out his soul unto God, and hath not more freedom in any
   thing than in dealing about that whereof he is most ashamed.

   2. Full also it must be. Reserves ruin confession. If the soul have any
   secret thought of rolling a sweet morsel under its tongue, of a bow in
   the house of Rimmon, it is like part of the price kept back, which
   makes the whole robbery instead of an offering. If there be remaining a
   bitter root of favouring any one lust or sin, of any occasion of or
   temptation unto sin, let a man be as open, free, and earnest as can be
   imagined in the acknowledgment of all other sins and evils, the whole
   duty is rendered abominable. Some persons, when they are brought into
   depths and anguish about any sin, and are thereon forced to the
   acknowledgment of it, at the same time they are little concerned with
   their other follies and iniquities, that, it may be, are no less
   provoking unto God than that is from whence their present trouble doth
   arise. "Let not," as James speaks in another case, "such a man think
   that he shall receive any thing of the Lord." It must be full and
   comprehensive, as well as free and ingenuous.

   And of such importance is the right performance of this duty, that the
   promise of pardon is ofttimes peculiarly annexed unto it, as that which
   certainly carries along with it the other duties which make up a full
   returnal unto God, Prov. xxviii. 13; 1 John i. 9. And that place in Job
   is remarkable, chap. xxxiii. 27, 28, "He looketh upon men, and if any
   say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited
   me not; he will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life
   shall see the light." He shall not only be made partaker of pardon, but
   of consolation also, and joy in the light of God's countenance.

   Thirdly. There yet remains self-condemnation with the justification of
   God, which lies expressly in the words of the verse under
   consideration; and hereof are two parts:--

   1. Self-abhorrency, or dislike. The soul is now wholly displeased with
   itself, and reflects upon itself with all affections of regret and
   trouble. So the apostle declares it to have been with the Corinthians,
   when their godly sorrow was working in them, 2 Cor. vii. 11. Among
   other things, it wrought in them "indignation and revenge;" or a
   reflection on themselves with all manner of dislike and abhorrency. In
   the winding up of the controversy between God and Job, this is the
   point he rests in. As he had come in general to a free, full, ingenuous
   acknowledgment of sin, chap. xl. 4, 5, so in particular he gives up his
   whole contest in this abhorrency of himself, chap. xlii. 6, "I abhor
   myself, and repent in dust and ashes." "What a vile, wretched creature
   have I been!" saith the soul. "I blush and am ashamed to think of my
   folly, baseness, and ingratitude. Is it possible that I should deal
   thus with the Lord? I abhor, I loathe myself; I would fly anywhere from
   myself, I am so vile and loathsome, -- a thing to be despised of God,
   angels, and men." And, --

   2. There is self-judging in it also. This the apostle invites the
   Corinthians unto, 1 Epist. xi. 31, "If we would judge ourselves, we
   should not be judged." This is a person pronouncing sentence on himself
   according to the tenor of the law. The soul brings not only its sin but
   itself also to the law. It puts itself, as to merit and desert, under
   the stroke and severity of it. Hence ariseth a full justification of
   God in what sentences soever he shall be pleased to pronounce in the
   case before him.

   And these three things which we have passed through compose the frame
   and first actings of a gracious soul rising from its depths. They are
   all of them signally expressed in that place where we have a signal
   recovery exemplified, Hos. xiv. 1-3. And this makes way for the
   exaltation of grace, the great thing in all this dispensation aimed at
   by God, Eph. i. 6. That which he is now doing is to bring the soul to
   glory in him, 1 Cor. i. 31; which is all the return he hath from his
   large and infinitely bountiful expenses of grace and mercy. Now,
   nothing can render grace conspicuous and glorious until the soul come
   to this frame. Grace will not seem high until the soul be laid very
   low. And this also suits or prepares the soul for the receiving of
   mercy in a sense of pardon, the great thing aimed at on the part of the
   sinner; and it prepares it for every duty that is incumbent on him in
   that condition wherein he is. This brings the soul to waiting with
   diligence and patience. If things presently answer not our expectation,
   we are ready to think we have done what we can; if it will be no
   better, we must bear it as we are able; -- which frame God abhors. The
   soul in this frame is contented to wait the pleasure of God, as we
   shall see in the close of this psalm. "Oh," saith such a one, "if ever
   I obtain a sense of love, if ever I enjoy one smile of his countenance
   more, it is of unspeakable grace. Let him take his own time, his own
   season; it is good for me quietly to wait, and to hope for his
   salvation." And it puts the soul on prayer; yea, a soul in this frame
   prays always. And there is nothing more evident than that want of a
   thorough engagement unto the performance of these duties is the great
   cause why so few come clear off from their entanglement all their days.
   Men heal their wounds slightly; and, therefore, after a new, painful
   festering, they are brought into the same condition of restlessness and
   trouble which they were in before.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Grounds of miscarriages when persons are convinced of sin and humbled
   -- Resting in that state -- Resting on it.

   The soul is not to be left in the state before described. There is
   other work for it to apply itself unto, if it intend to come unto rest
   and peace. It hath obtained an eminent advantage for the discovery of
   forgiveness; but to rest in that state wherein it is, or to rest upon
   it, will not bring it into its harbour. Three things we discovered
   before in the soul's first serious address unto God for deliverance, --
   sense of sin, acknowledgment of it, and self-condemnation. Two evils
   there are which attend men oftentimes when they are brought into that
   state. Some rest in it, and press no farther; some rest upon it, and
   suppose that it is all which is required of them. The psalmist avoids
   both these, and notwithstanding all his pressures reacheth out towards
   forgiveness, as we shall see in the next verse. I shall briefly unfold
   these two evils, and show the necessity of their avoidance:--

   First, By resting or staying in it, I mean the soul's desponding,
   through discouraging thoughts that deliverance is not to be obtained.
   Being made deeply sensible of sin, it is so overwhelmed with thoughts
   of its own vileness and unworthiness as to sink under the burden. Such
   a soul is "afflicted, and tossed with tempest, and not comforted," Isa.
   liv. 11, until it is quite weary; -- as a ship in a storm at sea, when
   all means of contending are gone, men give up themselves to be driven
   and tossed by the winds and seas at their pleasure. This brought Israel
   to that state wherein he cried out, "My way is hid from the Lord, and
   my judgment is passed over from my God," chap. xl. 27; and Zion, "The
   Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me," chap. xlix. 14.
   The soul begins secretly to think there is no hope; God regardeth it
   not; it shall one day perish; relief is far away, and trouble nigh at
   hand. These thoughts do so oppress them, that though they forsake not
   God utterly to their destruction, yet they draw not nigh unto him
   effectually to their consolation.

   This is the first evil that the soul in this condition is enabled to
   avoid. We know how God rebukes it in Zion: "Zion said, The Lord hath
   forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me," chap. xlix. 14. But how
   foolish is Zion, how froward, how unbelieving in this matter! What
   ground hath she for such sinful despondencies, such discouraging
   conclusions? "Can a woman," saith the Lord, "forget her sucking child,
   that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they
   may forget, yet will I not forget thee." The like reproof he gives to
   Jacob upon the like complaint, chap. xl. 28-31. There is nothing that
   is more provoking to the Lord, nor more disadvantageous unto the soul,
   than such sinful despondency; for, --

   1. It insensibly weaken, the soul, and disenables it both for present
   duties and future endeavour, Hence some poor creatures mourn, and even
   pine away in this condition, never getting one step beyond a perplexing
   sense of sin all their days. Some have dwelt so long upon it, and have
   so entangled themselves with a multitude of perplexed thoughts, that at
   length their natural faculties have been weakened and rendered utterly
   useless; so that they have lost Both sense of sin and every thing else.
   Against some, Satan hath taken advantage to cast in so many entangling
   objections into their minds, that their whole time hath been taken up
   in proposing doubts and objections against themselves; with these they
   have gone up and down to one and another, and being never able to come
   unto a consistency in their own thoughts, they have spent all their
   days in a fruitless, sapless, withering, comfortless condition. Some,
   with whom things come to a better issue, are yet for a season brought
   to that discomposure of spirit, or are so filled with their own
   apprehensions, that when the things which are most proper to their
   condition are spoken to them, they take no impression in the least upon
   them. Thus the soul is weakened by dwelling too long on these
   considerations; until some cry with those in Ezek. xxxiii. 10, "Our
   sins are upon us, we pine away in them, how should we then live?"

   2. This frame, if it abides by itself, will insensibly give countenance
   unto hard thoughts of God, and so to repining and weariness in waiting
   on him. At first the soul neither apprehends nor fears any such issue
   It supposeth that it shall condemn and abhor itself and justify God,
   and that for ever. But when relief comes not in, this resolution begins
   to weaken. Secret thoughts arise in the heart that God is austere,
   inexorable, and not to be dealt withal. This sometimes casts forth such
   complaints as will bring the soul unto new complaints before it comes
   to have an issue of its trials. Here, in humiliation antecedaneous to
   conversion, many a convinced person perisheth. They cannot wait God's
   season, and perish under their impatience. And what the saints of God
   themselves have been overtaken withal in their depths and trials, we
   have many examples and instances. Delight and expectations are the
   grounds of our abiding with God. Both these are weakened by a
   conquering, prevailing sense of sin, without some relief from the
   discovery of forgiveness, though at a distance. And, therefore, our
   perplexed soul stays not here, but presseth on towards that discovery.

   Secondly, There is a resting on this frame that is noxious and hurtful
   also. Some finding this sense of sin, with those other things that
   attend it, wrought in them in some measure, begin to think that now all
   is well, this is all that is of them required. They will endeavour to
   make a life from such arguments of comfort as they can take from their
   trouble. They think this a ground of peace, that they have not peace.
   Here some take up before conversion, and it proves their ruin. Because
   they are convinced of sin, and troubled about it, and burdened with it,
   they think it shall be well with them. But were not Cain, Esau, Saul,
   Ahab, Judas, convinced of sin and burdened with it? Did this profit
   them? did it interest them in the promises? Did not the wrath of God
   overtake them notwithstanding? So is it with many daily; they think
   their conviction is conversion, and that their sins are pardoned
   because they have been troubled.

   This, then, is that which we reject, which the soul in this condition
   doth carefully avoid, -- so to satisfy itself with its humiliation, as
   to make that a ground of supportment and consolation, being thereby
   kept off from exercising faith for forgiveness; for this is, --

   1. A fruit of self-righteousness. For a soul to place the spring of its
   peace or comfort in any thing of its own, is to fall short of Christ
   and to take up in self. We must not only be "justified," but "glory" in
   him also, Isa. xlv. 25. Men may make use of the evidence of their
   graces, but only as mediums to a farther end; not as the rest of the
   soul in the least. And this deprives men's very humiliations of all
   gospel humility. True humility consists more in believing than in being
   sensible of sin. That is the soul's great self-emptying and abasing;
   this may consist with an obstinate resolution to scamble for something
   upon the account of self-endeavours.

   2. Though evangelical sense of sin be a grace, yet it is not the
   uniting grace; it is not that which interests us in Christ, not that
   which peculiarly and in its own nature exalts him. There is in this
   sense of sin that which is natural and that which is spiritual; or the
   matter of it and its spirituality. The former consists in sorrow,
   trouble, self-abasement, dejection, and anxiety of mind, with the like
   passions. Of these I may say, as the apostle of afflictions, "They are
   not joyous, but grievous." They are such as are accompanied with the
   aversation of the object which they are conversant about. In their own
   nature they are no more but the soul's retreat into itself, with an
   abhorrency of the objects of its sorrow and grief. When these
   affections are spiritualized, their nature is not changed. The soul in
   and by them acts according to their nature; and doth by them, as such,
   but retreat into itself, with a dislike of that they are exercised
   about To take up here, then, must needs be to sit down short of Christ,
   whether it be for life or consolation.

   Let there be no mistake. There can be no evangelical sense of sin and
   humiliation where there is not union with Christ, Zech. xii. 10. Only
   in itself and in its own nature it is not availing. Now, Christ is the
   only rest of our souls; in any thing, for any end or purpose, to take
   up short of him is to lose it. It is not enough that we be "prisoners
   of hope," but we must "turn to our stronghold," Zech. ix. 12; not
   enough that we are "weary and heavy laden," but we must "come to him,"
   Matt. xi. 28-30. It will not suffice that we are weak, and know we are
   weak, but we must "take hold on the strength of God," Isa. xxvii. 4, 5.

   3. Indeed, pressing after forgiveness is the very life and power of
   evangelical humiliation. How shall a man know that his humiliation is
   evangelical, that his sorrow is according to God? Is it not from hence
   he may be resolved, that he doth not in it as Cain did, who cried his
   sins were greater than he could bear, and so departed from the presence
   of God; nor as Judas did, who repented and hanged himself; nor as Felix
   did, -- tremble for a while, and then return to his lusts; nor as the
   Jews did in the prophet, pine away under their iniquities because of
   vexation of heart? Nor doth he divert his thoughts to other things,
   thereby to relieve his soul in his trouble; nor fix upon a
   righteousness of his own; nor slothfully lie down under his perplexity,
   but in the midst of it he plies himself to God in Christ for pardon and
   mercy. And it is the soul's application unto God for forgiveness, and
   not its sense of sin, that gives unto God the glory of his grace.

   Thus far, then, have we accompanied the soul in its depths. It is now
   looking out for forgiveness; which, what it is, and how we come to have
   an interest in it, the principal matter in this discourse intended, is
   nextly to be considered.
     __________________________________________________________________

                                 Verse fourth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The words explained, and the design or scope of the psalmist in them
   discovered.

   The state and condition of the soul making application unto God in this
   psalm is recounted, verse 1. It was in the "depths" not only
   providential depths of trouble, affliction, and perplexities thereon;
   but also depths of conscience, distress on the account of sin; as in
   the opening of those words have been declared.

   The application of this soul unto God, with restless fervency and
   earnestness, in that state and condition; its consideration in the
   first place of the law, and the severity of God's justice in a
   procedure thereon, with the inevitable ruin of all sinners if God
   insist on that way of dealing with them, -- have also been opened and
   manifested from the foregoing verses.

   Being in this estate, perplexed in itself, lost in and under the
   consideration of God's marking iniquity according to the tenor of the
   law, that which it fixes on, from whence any relief, stay, or
   supportment might be expected in such a condition, is laid down in this
   verse.

   Verse 4. -- "But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
   feared."

   I shall first open the words as to their signification and importance;
   then show the design of the psalmist in them, with reference to the
   soul whose condition is here represented; and, lastly, propose the
   general truths contained in them, wherein all our concernments do lie.

   "There is forgiveness." Hilasmos say the LXX., and Jerome accordingly,
   "propitiatio," "propitiation;" which is somewhat more than "venia," or
   "pardon," as by some it is rendered.

   hslychh? Condonatio ipsa," "Forgiveness itself." It is from slch?, to
   spare, to pardon, to forgive, to be propitious; and is opposed to
   chsl?, a word composed of the same letters varied (which is common in
   that language), signifying to cut off and destroy.

   Now, it is constantly applied unto sin, and expresseth every thing that
   concurs to its pardon or forgiveness; as, --

   First, It expresseth the mind or will of pardoning, or God's gracious
   readiness to forgive: Ps. lxxxvi. 5, "Thou, Lord, art good, vslch?, and
   ready to forgive;" chrestos kai epieikes, "benign and meek," or
   "sparing, propitious, -- of a gracious, merciful heard and nature. So
   Neh ix. 17, "Thou art a God slychvt? "propitiationum," of propitiations
   or pardons;" or, as we have rendered it, "ready to forgive," -- "a God
   of forgivenesses;" or, "all plenty of them is in thy gracious heart,"
   Isa. lv. 7, "so that thou art always ready to make out pardons to
   sinners." The word is used again, Dan. ix. 9, to the same purpose.

   Secondly, It regards the act of pardoning, or actual forgiveness
   itself: Ps. ciii. 3, hslch?, "Who forgiveth all thine iniquities," --
   "actually dischargeth thee of them;" which place the apostle
   respecting, renders the word by charisamenos: Col. ii. 13, "Having
   freely forgiven you" (for so much the word imports) "all your
   trespasses."

   And this is the word that God useth in the covenant, in that great
   promise of grace and pardon, Jer. xxxi. 34.

   It is warrantable for us, yea, necessary, to take the word in the
   utmost extent of its signifcation and use. It is a word of favour, and
   requires an interpretation tending towards the enlargement of it. We
   see it may be rendered hilasmos, or "propitiation;" charis, or "grace;"
   and "venia," or "pardon;" and may denote these three things:--

   1. The gracious, tender, merciful heart and will of God, who is the God
   of pardons and forgivenesses; or ready to forgive, to give out mercy,
   to add to pardon.

   2. A respect unto Jesus Christ, the only hilasmos, or propitiation for
   sin, as he is expressly called, Rom. iii. 25; 1 John ii. 2. And this is
   that which interposeth between the gracious heart of God and the actual
   pardon of sinners. All forgiveness is founded on propitiation.

   3. It denotes condonation, or actual forgiveness itself, as we are made
   partakers of it; comprising it both actively, as it is an act of grace
   in God, and passively, as terminated in our souls, with the deliverance
   that attends it. In this sense, as it looks downwards and in its
   effects respects us, it is of mere grace; as it looks upwards to its
   causes and respects the Lord Christ, it is from propitiation or
   atonement. And this is that pardon which is administered in the
   covenant of grace.

   Now, as to the place which these words enjoy in this psalm, and their
   relation to the state and condition of the soul here mentioned, this
   seems to be their importance:--

   "O Lord, although this must be granted, that if thou shouldst mark
   iniquities according to the tenor of the law, every man living must
   perish, and that for ever; yet there is hope for my soul, that even I,
   who am in the depths of sin-entanglements, may find acceptance with
   thee: for whilst I am putting my mouth in the dust, if so be there may
   be hope, I find that there is an atonement, a propitiation made for
   sin, on the account whereof thou sayest thou hast found a ransom, and
   wilt not deal with them that come unto thee according to the severity
   and exigence of thy justice; but art gracious, loving, tender, ready to
   forgive and pardon, and dost so accordingly. There is forgiveness with
   thee."

   The following words, "Therefore thou shalt be feared," or "That thou
   mayest be feared," though in the original free from all ambiguity, yet
   are so signally varied by interpreters, that it may not be amiss to
   take notice of it in our passage.

   The Targum hath it, "That thou mayest be seen." This answers not the
   word, But it doth the sense of the place well enough. God in his
   displeasure is said to hide himself or his face: Isa. viii. 17, "The
   Lord hideth his face from the house of Jacob." By forgiveness we obtain
   again the light of his countenance. This dispels the darkness and
   clouds that are about him, and gives us a comfortable prospect of his
   face and favour. "There is forgiveness with him that he may be seen."
   Besides, there is but one letter different in the original words, and
   that which is usually changed for the other.

   The LXX. render them, Heneka tou onomatos sou, -- "For thy name's
   sake," or "thy own sake;" that is, freely, without any respect unto any
   thing in us. This also would admit of a fair and sound construction,
   but that there is more than ordinary evidence of the places being
   corrupted: for the Vulgar Latin, which, as to the Psalms, was
   translated out of the LXX., renders these words, "Propter legem tuam,"
   -- "For thy law's sake;" which makes it evident that that translator
   reads the words heneka tou nomou sou, and not onomatos, as now we read.
   Now, though this hath in itself no proper sense (for forgiveness is not
   bestowed for the law's sake), yet it discovers the original of the
   whole mistake. tvrh?, "the law," differs but in one letter from tvr'?,
   "that thou mayest be feared;" by a mistake whereof this heneka tou
   nomou, "for thy law's sake," crept into the text. Nor doth this any
   thing countenance the corrupt figment of the novelty of the Hebrew
   vowels and accents, as though this difference might arise from the LXX.
   using a copy that had none, -- that is, before their invention, which
   might occasion mistakes and differences; for this difference is in a
   letter as well as in the vowels, and therefore there can be no colour
   for this conceit, unless we say also that they had copies of old with
   other consonants than those we now enjoy. Bellarmine, in his exposition
   of this place, endeavours to give countenance unto the reading of the
   Vulgar Latin, "For thy law's sake;" affirming that by the law here, not
   the law of our obedience is intended, but the law or order of God's
   dealing with us, that is, his mercy and faithfulness; -- which is a
   mere new invention to countenance an old error, which any tolerable
   ingenuity would have confessed, rather than have justified by so sorry
   a pretence; for neither is that expression or that word ever used in
   the sense here by him feigned, nor can it have any such signification.

   Jerome renders these words, "Ut sis terribilis," -- "That thou mayest
   be dreadful or terrible;" doubtless not according to the intendment of
   the place. It is for the relieving of the soul, and not for the
   increasing of its dread and terror, that this observation is made,
   "There is forgiveness with thee."

   But the words are clear, and their sense is obvious. lmn tvr'?, --
   "Therefore thou shalt be feared;" or, "That thou mayest be feared."

   By the "fear of the Lord," in the Old Testament, the whole worship of
   God, moral and instituted, all the obedience which we owe unto him,
   both for matter and manner, is intended. Whatever we are to perform
   unto God, being to be carried on and performed with reverence and godly
   fear, by a metonymy of the adjunct, that name is given to the whole.
   "That thou mayest be feared," then, is, "That thou mayest be served,
   worshipped; that I, who am ready to faint and give over on the account
   of sin, may yet be encouraged unto, and yet continue in, that obedience
   which thou requirest at my hands:" and this appears to be the sense of
   the whole verse, as influenced by and from those foregoing:--

   "Although, O Lord, no man can approach unto thee, stand before thee, or
   walk with thee, if thou shouldst mark their sins and follies according
   to the tenor of the law, nor could they serve so great and holy a God
   as thou art; yet because I know from thy revelation of it that there is
   also with thee, on the account of Jesus Christ the propitiation, pardon
   and forgiveness, I am encouraged to continue with thee, waiting for
   thee, worshipping of thee, when, without this discovery, I should
   rather choose to have rocks and mountains fall upon me, to hide me from
   thy presence."

   "But there is forgiveness with thee, and therefore thou shalt be
   feared."

   The words being thus opened, we may take a full view in them of the
   state and condition of the soul expressed in this psalm; and that
   answering the experiences of all who have had any thing to do with God
   in and about the depths and entanglements of sin.

   Having in and from his great depths, verse 1, addressed himself with
   fervent, redoubled cries, yea, outcries to God, and to him alone, for
   relief, verses 1, 2; having also acknowledged his iniquities, and
   considered them according to the tenor of the law, verse 3; he
   confesseth himself to be lost and undone for ever on that account,
   verse 3. But he abides not in the state of self-condemnation and
   dejection of soul; he says not, "There is no hope; God is a jealous
   God, a holy God, I cannot serve him; his law is a fiery law, which I
   cannot stand before; so that I had as good give over, sit down and
   perish, as contend any longer!" No; but searching by faith into the
   discovery that God makes of himself in Christ through the covenant of
   grace, he finds a stable foundation of encouragement to continue
   waiting on him, with expectation of mercy and pardon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Propositions or observations from the former exposition of the words --
   The first proposed to confirmation -- No encouragement for any sinner
   to approach unto God without a discovery of forgiveness.

   From the words unfolded, as they lie in their contexture in the psalm,
   the ensuing propositions do arise:--

   First, Faith's discovery of forgiveness in God, though it have no
   present sense of its own peculiar interest therein, is the great
   supportment of a sin-perplexed soul.

   Secondly, Gospel forgiveness, whose discovery is the sole supportment
   of sin-distressed souls, relates to the gracious heart or good will of
   the Father, the God of forgiveness, the propitiation that is made by
   the blood of the Son, and free condonation or pardon according to the
   tenor of the covenant of grace.

   Thirdly, Faith's discovery of forgiveness in God is the sole bottom of
   adherence to him, in acceptable worship and reverential obedience.

   The first of these is that whose confirmation and improvement I
   principally aim at; and the others only so far as they have coincidence
   therewith, or may be used in a subserviency to the illustration or
   demonstration thereof.

   In the handling, then, of this truth, that it may be of the more
   advantage unto them whose good is sought and intended in the proposal
   and management of it, I shall steer this course, and show, --

   First, That there is not the least encouragement to the soul of a
   sinner to deal with God without this discovery.

   Secondly, That this discovery of forgiveness in God is a matter great,
   holy, and mysterious; and which very few on gospel abiding grounds do
   attain unto.

   Thirdly, That yet this is a great, sacred, and certain truth, as from
   the manifold evidences of it may be made to appear.

   Fourthly, That this is a stable supportment unto a sin-distressed soul
   shall be manifested, and the whole applied, according to the several
   concernments of those who shall consider it.

   First. There is not the least encouragement for the soul of a sinner to
   entertain any thoughts of approaching unto God without this discovery.
   All the rest of the world is covered with a deluge of wrath. This is
   the only ark whereunto the soul may repair and find rest. All without
   it is darkness, curse, and terror.

   We have an instance and example of it, beyond all exception, in Adam.
   When he knew himself to be a sinner (and it was impossible for him, as
   we shall show afterward, to make a discovery of any such thing as
   forgiveness with God), he laid aside all thoughts of treating with him;
   the best of his foolish contrivance was for an escape: Gen. iii. 10, "I
   heard thy voice," saith he to God, "in the garden, and I was afraid,
   because I was naked; and I hid myself." Nothing but "Thou shalt die the
   death," sounded in his ears. In the morning of that day, he was made by
   the hand of God; a few hours before, he had converse and communion with
   him, with boldness and peace; why, then, doth nothing now but fear,
   flying, and hiding, possess him? Adam had sinned, the promise was not
   yet given, no revelation made of forgiveness in God; and what other
   course than that vain and foolish one to fix upon he knew not. No more
   can any of his posterity, without this revelation. What else any of
   them hath fixed on in this case hath been no less foolish than his
   hiding; and in most, more pernicious. When Cain had received his
   sentence from God, it is said "he went out mlphny yhvh?, from the
   presence" or face "of the Lord," Gen. iv. 16. From his providential
   presence he could never subduct himself: so the psalmist informs us at
   large, Ps. cxxxix. 7-10. The very heathen knew, by the light of nature,
   that guilt could never drive men out of the reach of God:--


   "Quo fugis Encelade? quascunque accesseris oras

   Sub Jove semper eris."

   They knew that dike (the vengeance of God) would not spare sinners, nor
   could be avoided, Acts xxviii. 4. From God's gracious presence, which
   he never enjoyed, he could not depart. It was, then, his presence as to
   his worship, and all outward acts of communion, that he forsook, and
   departed from. He had no discovery by faith of forgiveness, and
   therefore resolved to have no more to do with God, nor those who
   cleaved to him; for it respects his course, and not any one particular
   action.

   This also is stated, Isa. xxxiii. 14, "The sinners in Zion are afraid;
   fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell
   with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting
   burnings?" The persons spoken of are sinners, great sinners, and
   hypocrites. Conviction of sin and the desert of it was fallen upon
   them; a light to discern forgiveness they had not; they apprehend God
   as devouring fire and everlasting burnings only, -- one that would not
   spare, but assuredly inflict punishment according to the desert of sin;
   and thence is their conclusion, couched in their interrogation, that
   there can be no intercourse of peace between him and them, -- there is
   no abiding, no enduring of his presence. And what condition this
   consideration brings the souls of sinners unto, when conviction grows
   strong upon them, the Holy Ghost declares: Micah vi. 6, 7, "Wherewith
   shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall
   I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will
   the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of
   rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the
   fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" Sense of sin presseth,
   forgiveness is not discovered (like the Philistines on Saul, Samuel not
   coming to his direction); and how doth the poor creature perplex itself
   in vain, to find out a way of dealing with God? "Will a sedulous and
   diligent observation of his own ordinances and institutions relieve me?
   shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year
   old?'?" Alas! thou art a sinner, and these sacrifices cannot make thee
   "perfect," or acquit thee, Heb. x. 1. "Shall I do more than ever he
   required of any of the sons of men? that I had thousands of rams, and
   ten thousands of rivers of oil' to offer to him!" Alas! if thou hadst
   all the "bulls and goats" in the world, "it is not possible that their
   blood should take away sins," verse 4. "But I have heard of them who
   have snatched their own children from their mothers' breasts, and cast
   them into the fire, until they were consumed, so to pacify their
   consciences in expiating the guilt of their iniquities. Shall I take
   this course? will it relieve me? I am ready to part with my first-born'
   into the fire, so I may have deliverance from my transgression.' Alas!
   this never came into the heart of God to approve or accept of. And as
   it was then, whilst that kind of worship was in force, so is it still
   as to any duties really to be performed, or imaginarily. Where there is
   no discovery of forgiveness, they will yield the soul no relief, no
   supportment; God is not to be treated upon such terms.

   Greatness and rareness of the discovery of forgiveness in God --
   Reasons of it -- Testimonies of conscience and law against it, etc.

   Secondly. This discovery of forgiveness in God is great, holy, and
   mysterious, and which very few on gospel grounds do attain unto.

   All men, indeed, say there is; most men are persuaded that they think
   so. Only men in great and desperate extremities, like Cain or Spira,
   seem to call it into question. But their thoughts are empty,
   groundless, yea, for the most part wicked and atheistical. Elihu tells
   us, that to declare this aright to a sinful soul, it is the work of "a
   messenger, an interpreter, one among a thousand," Job xxxiii. 23; that
   is, indeed, of Christ himself. The common thoughts of men about this
   thing are slight and foolish, and may be resolved into those mentioned
   by the psalmist, Ps. l. 21. They think that "God is altogether such an
   one as themselves;" that, indeed, he takes little or no care about
   these things, but passeth them over as slightly as they do themselves.
   That, notwithstanding all their pretences, the most of men never had
   indeed any real discovery of forgiveness, shall be afterward undeniably
   evinced; and I shall speedily show the difference that is between their
   vain credulity and a gracious gospel discovery of forgiveness in God.
   For it must be observed, that by this discovery I intend both the
   revelation of it made by God and our understanding and reception of
   that revelation to our own advantage; as shall be showed immediately.

   Now, the grounds of the difficulty intimated consist partly in the
   hinderances that lie in the way of this discovery, and partly in the
   nature of the thing itself that is discovered; of both which I shall
   briefly treat.

   But here, before I proceed, somewhat must be premised to show what it
   is that I particularly intend by a discovery of forgiveness. It may,
   then, be considered two ways:-- 1. For a doctrinal, objective discovery
   of it in its truth. 2. An experimental, subjective discovery of it in
   its power. In the first sense, forgiveness in God hath been discovered
   ever since the giving out of the first promise: God revealed it in a
   word of promise, or it could never have been known; as shall be
   afterward declared. In this sense, after many lesser degrees and
   advancements of the light of it, it was fully and gloriously brought
   forth by the Lord Jesus Christ in his own person, and is now revealed
   and preached in the gospel, and by them to whom the word of
   reconciliation is committed; and to declare this is the principal work
   of the ministers of the gospel. Herein lie those unsearchable treasures
   and riches of Christ, which the apostle esteemed as his chiefest honour
   and privilege that he was intrusted with the declaration and
   dispensation of, Eph. iii. 8, 9. I know by many it is despised, by many
   traduced, whose ignorance and blindness is to be lamented; but the day
   is coming which will manifest every man's work of what sort it is. In
   the latter sense, how it is made by faith in the soul, shall in its
   proper place be farther opened and made known. Here many men mistake
   and deceive themselves. Because it is so in the book, they think it is
   so in them also. Because they have been taught it, they think they
   believe it. But it is not so; they have not heard this voice of God at
   any time, nor seen his shape. It hath not been revealed unto them in
   its power.

   To have this done is a great work; for, --

   First, The constant voice of conscience lies against it. Conscience, if
   not seared, inexorably condemneth and pronounceth wrath and anger upon
   the soul that hath the least guilt cleaving to it. Now, it hath this
   advantage, it lieth close to the soul, and by importunity and loud
   speaking it will be heard in what it hath to say; it will make the
   whole soul attend, or it will speak like thunder. And its constant
   voice is, that where there is guilt there must be judgment, Rom. ii.
   14, 15. Conscience naturally knows nothing of forgiveness; yea, it is
   against its very trust, work, and office to hear any thing of it. If a
   man of courage and honesty be intrusted to keep a garrison against an
   enemy, let one come and tell him that there is peace made between those
   whom he serves and their enemies, so that he may leave his guard, and
   set open the gates, and cease his watchfulness; how wary will he be,
   lest under this pretence he be betrayed! "No," saith he; "I will keep
   my hold until I have express order from my superiors." Conscience is
   intrusted with the power of God in the soul of a sinner, with command
   to keep all in subjection with reference unto the judgment to come. It
   will not betray its trust in believing every report of peace. No; but
   this it says, and it speaks in the name of God, "Guilt and punishment
   are inseparable twins; if the soul sin, God will judge. What tell you
   me of forgiveness? I know what my commission is, and that I will abide
   by. You shall not bring in a superior commander, a cross principle,
   into my trust; for if this be so, it seems I must let go my throne, --
   another lord must come in;" not knowing, as yet, how this whole
   business is compounded in the blood of Christ. Now, whom should a man
   believe if not his own conscience, which, as it will not flatter him,
   so it intends not to affright him, but to speak the truth as the matter
   requireth? Conscience hath two works in reference unto sin, -- one to
   condemn the acts of sin, another to judge the person of the sinner;
   both with reference to the judgment of God. When forgiveness comes, it
   would sever and part these employments, and take one of them out of the
   hand of conscience; it would divide the spoil with this strong one. It
   shall condemn the fact, or every sin: but it shall no more condemn the
   sinner, the person of the sinner; that shall be freed from its
   sentence. Here conscience labours with all its might to keep its whole
   dominion, and to keep out the power of forgiveness from being enthroned
   in the soul. It will allow men to talk of forgiveness, to hear it
   preached, though they abuse it every day; but to receive it in its
   power, that stands up in direct opposition to its dominion. "In the
   kingdom," saith conscience, "I will be greater than thou;" and in many,
   in the most, it keeps its possession, and will not be deposed.

   Nor, indeed, is it an easy work so to deal with it. The apostle tells
   us that all the sacrifices of the law could not do it, Heb. x. 2: they
   could not bring a man into that estate wherein he "should have no more
   conscience of sin;" -- that is, conscience condemning the person; for
   conscience in a sense of sin, and condemnation of it, is never to be
   taken away. And this can be no otherwise done but by the blood of
   Christ, as the apostle at large there declares.

   It is, then, no easy thing to make a discovery of forgiveness unto a
   soul, when the work and employment which conscience, upon
   unquestionable grounds, challengeth unto itself lies in opposition unto
   it. Hence is the soul's great desire to establish its own
   righteousness, whereby its natural principles may be preserved in their
   power. Let self-righteousness be enthroned, and natural conscience
   desires no more; it is satisfied and pacified. The law it knows, and
   righteousness it knows; but as for forgiveness, it says, "Whence is
   it?" Unto the utmost, until Christ perfects his conquest, there are on
   this account secret strugglings in the heart against free pardon in the
   gospel, and fluctuations of mind and spirit about it. Yea, hence are
   the doubts and fears of believers themselves. They are nothing but the
   strivings of conscience to keep its whole dominion, to condemn the
   sinner as well as the sin. More or less it keeps up its pretensions
   against the gospel whilst we live in this world. It is a great work
   that the blood of Christ hath to do upon the conscience of a sinner;
   for whereas, as it hath been declared, it hath a power, and claims a
   right to condemn both sin and sinner, the one part of this its power is
   to be cleared, strengthened, made more active, vigorous, and watchful,
   the other to be taken quite away. It shall now see more sins than
   formerly, more of the vileness of all sins than formerly, and condemn
   them with more abhorrency than ever, upon more and more glorious
   accounts than formerly; but it is also made to see an interposition
   between these sins and the person of the sinner who hath committed
   them, which is no small or ordinary work.

   Secondly, The law lies against this discovery. The law is a beam of the
   holiness of God himself. What it speaks unto us, it speaks in the name
   and authority of God; and I shall briefly show concerning it these two
   things -- 1. That this is the voice of the law, -- namely, that there
   is no forgiveness for a sinner. 2. That a sinner hath great reason to
   give credit to the law in that assertion.

   1. It is certain that the law knows neither mercy nor forgiveness. The
   very sanction of it lies wholly against them: "The soul that sinneth,
   it shall die;" "Cursed is he that continueth not in all things in the
   book of the law to do them," Deut. xxvii. 26; [Gal. iii. 10.] Hence the
   apostle pronounceth universally, without exception, that they who "are
   under the law are under the curse," Gal. iii. 10; and saith he, verse
   12, "The law is not of faith." There is an inconsistency between the
   law and believing; they cannot have their abode in power together." Do
   this and live;' fail and die," is the constant, immutable voice of the
   law. This it speaks in general to all, and this in particular to every
   one.

   2. The sinner seems to have manifold and weighty reasons to attend to
   the voice of this law, and to acquiesce in its sentence; for, --

   (1.) The law is connatural to him; his domestic, his old acquaintance.
   It came into the world with him, and hath grown up with him from his
   infancy. It was implanted in his heart by nature, -- is his own reason;
   he can never shake it off or part with it. It is his familiar, his
   friend, that cleaves to him as the flesh to the bone; so that they who
   have not the law written cannot but show forth the work of the law,
   Rom. ii. 14, 15, and that because the law itself is inbred to them. And
   all the faculties of the soul are at peace with it, in subjection to
   it. It is the bond and ligament of their union, harmony, and
   correspondency among themselves, in all their moral actings. It gives
   life, order, motion to them all. Now, the gospel, that comes to control
   this sentence of the law, and to relieve the sinner from it, is foreign
   to his nature, a strange thing to him, a thing he hath no acquaintance
   or familiarity with; it hath not been bred up with him; nor is there
   any thing in him to side with it, to make a party for it, or to plead
   in its behalf. Now, shall not a man rather believe a domestic, a
   friend, indeed himself, than a foreigner, a stranger, that comes with
   uncouth principles, and such as suit not its reason at all? 1 Cor. i.
   18.

   (2.) The law speaks nothing to a sinner but what his conscience assures
   him to be true. There is a constant concurrence in the testimony of the
   law and conscience. When the law says, "This or that is a sin worthy of
   death," conscience says, "It is even so," Rom. i. 32. And where the law
   of itself, as being a general rule, rests, conscience helps it on, and
   says, "This and that sin, so worthy of death, is the soul guilty of."
   "Then die," saith the law, "as thou hast deserved." Now, this must
   needs have a mighty efficacy to prevail with the soul to give credit to
   the report and testimony of the law; it speaks not one word but what he
   hath a witness within himself to the truth of it. These witnesses
   always agree; and so it seems to be established for a truth that there
   is no forgiveness.

   (3.) The law, though it speak against the soul's interest, yet it
   speaks nothing but what is so just, righteous, and equal, that it even
   forceth the soul's consent. So Paul tells us, that men know this voice
   of the law to be the "judgment of God," Rom. i. 32. They know it, and
   cannot but consent unto it, that it is the judgment of God, -- that is,
   good, righteous, equal, not to be controlled. And, indeed, what can be
   more righteous than its sentence? It commands obedience to the God of
   life and death; promiseth a reward, and declares that for
   non-performance of duty, death will be inflicted. On these terms the
   sinner cometh into the world. They are good, righteous, holy; the soul
   accepts of them, and knows not what it can desire better or more equal.
   This the apostle insists upon, chap. vii. 12, 13, "Wherefore the law is
   holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. Was then that which
   was good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear
   sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the
   commandment might become exceeding sinful." Wherever the blame falls,
   the soul cannot but acquit the law, and confess that what it says is
   righteous and uncontrollably equal. And it is meet things should be so.
   Now, though the authority and credit of a witness may go very far in a
   doubtful matter, when there is a concurrence of more witnesses it
   strengthens the testimony; but nothing is so prevalent to beget belief
   as when the things themselves that are spoken are just and good, not
   liable to any reasonable exception. And so is it in this case: unto the
   authority of the law and concurrence of conscience, this also is added,
   the reasonableness and equity of the thing itself proposed, even in the
   judgment of the sinner, -- namely, that every sin shall be punished,
   and every transgression receive a meet recompense of reward.

   (4.) But yet farther. What the law says, it speaks in the name and
   authority of God. What it says, then, must be believed, or we make God
   a liar. It comes not in its own name, but in the name of him who
   appointed it. You will say, then, "Is it so indeed? Is there no
   forgiveness with God? For this is the constant voice of the law, which
   you say speaks in the name and authority of God, and is therefore to be
   believed." I answer briefly with the apostle, "What the law speaks, it
   speaks to them that are under the law." It doth not speak to them that
   are "in Christ," whom the "law of the Spirit of life hath set free from
   the law of sin and death;" but to them that are "under the law" it
   speaks; and it speaks the very truth, and it speaks in the name of God,
   and its testimony is to be received. It says there is no forgiveness in
   God, namely, to them that are under the law; and they that shall
   flatter themselves with a contrary persuasion will find themselves
   wofully mistaken at the great day.

   On these and the like considerations, I say, there seems to be a great
   deal of reason why a soul should conclude that it will be according to
   the testimony of the law, and that he shall not find forgiveness. Law
   and conscience close together, and insinuate themselves into the
   thoughts, mind, and judgment of a sinner. They strengthen the testimony
   of one another, and greatly prevail. If any are otherwise minded, I
   leave them to the trial. If ever God awaken their consciences to a
   thorough performance of their duty, -- if ever he open their souls, and
   let in the light and power of the law upon them, -- they will find it
   no small work to grapple with them. I am sure that eventually they
   prevail so far, that in the preaching of the gospel we have great cause
   to say, "Lord, who hath believed our report?" We come with our report
   of forgiveness, but who believes it? by whom is it received? Neither
   doth the light, nor conscience, nor conversation of the most, allow us
   to suppose it is embraced.

   Thirdly, The ingrafted notions that are in the minds of men concerning
   the nature and justice of God lie against this discovery also. There
   are in all men by nature indelible characters of the holiness and
   purity of God, of his justice and hatred of sin, of his invariable
   righteousness in the government of the world, that they can neither
   depose nor lay aside; for notions of God, whatever they are, will bear
   sway and role in the heart, when things are put to the trial. They were
   in the heathens of old; they abode with them in all their darkness; as
   might be manifested by innumerable instances. But so it is in all men
   by nature. Their inward thought is, that God is an avenger of sin; that
   it belongs to his rule and government of the world, his holiness and
   righteousness, to take care that every sin be punished; this is his
   judgment, which all men know, as was observed before, Rom. i. 32. They
   know that it is a righteous thing with God to render tribulation unto
   sinners. From thence is that dread and fear which surpriseth men at an
   apprehension of the presence of God, or of any thing under him, above
   them, that may seem to come on his errand. This notion of God's
   avenging all sin exerts itself secretly but effectually. So Adam
   trembled, and hid himself. And it was the saying of old, "I have seen
   God, and shall die." When men are under any dreadful providence, --
   thunderings, lightnings, tempests, in darkness, -- they tremble; not so
   much at what they see, or hear, or feel, as from their secret thoughts
   that God is nigh, and that he is a consuming fire.

   Now, these inbred notions lie universally against all apprehensions of
   forgiveness, which must be brought into the soul from without doors,
   having no principle of nature to promote them.

   It is true, men by nature have presumptions and common ingrafted
   notions of other properties of God besides his holiness and justice, --
   as of his goodness, benignity, love of his creatures, and the like; but
   all these have this supposition inlaid with them in the souls of men,
   namely, that all things stand between God and his creatures as they did
   at their first creation. And as they have no natural notion of
   forgiveness, so the interposition of sin weakens, disturbs, darkens
   them, as to any improvement of those apprehensions of goodness and
   benignity which they have. If they have any notion of forgiveness, it
   is from some corrupt tradition, and not at all from any universal
   principle that is inbred in nature, such as are those which they have
   of God's holiness and vindictive justice.

   And this is the first ground; from whence it appears that a real, solid
   discovery of forgiveness is indeed a great work; many difficulties and
   hinderances lie in the way of its accomplishment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   False presumptions of forgiveness discovered -- Differences between
   them and faith evangelical.

   Before I proceed to produce and manage the remaining evidences of this
   truth, because what hath been spoken lies obnoxious and open to an
   objection, which must needs rise in the minds of many, that it may not
   thereby be rendered useless unto them, I shall remove it out of the
   way, that we may pass on to what remains.

   It will, then, be said, "Doth not all this lie directly contrary to our
   daily experience? Do ye not find all men full enough, most too full, of
   apprehensions of forgiveness with God? What so common as God is
   merciful?' Are not the consciences and convictions of the most stifled
   by this apprehension? Can you find a man that is otherwise minded? Is
   it not a common complaint, that men presume on it unto their eternal
   ruin? Certainly, then, that which all men do, which every man can so
   easily do, and which you cannot keep men off from doing, though it be
   to their hurt, hath no such difficulty in it as is pretended." And on
   this very account hath this weak endeavour to demonstrate this truth
   been by some laughed to scorn; men who have taken upon them the
   teaching of others, but, as it seems, had need be taught themselves the
   very "first principles of the oracles of God."

   Ans. All this, then, I say, is so, and much more to this purpose may be
   spoken. The folly and presumption of poor souls herein can never be
   enough lamented. But it is one thing to embrace a cloud, a shadow,
   another to have the truth in reality. I shall hereafter show the true
   nature of forgiveness and wherein it doth consist, whereby the vanity
   of this self-deceiving will be discovered and laid open. It will appear
   in the issue, that, notwithstanding all their pretensions, the most of
   men know nothing at all, or not any thing to the purpose, of that which
   is under consideration. I shall, therefore, for the present, in some
   few observations, show how far this delusion of many differs from a
   true gospel discovery of forgiveness, such as that we are inquiring
   after.

   First, The common notion of forgiveness that men have in the world is
   twofold -- 1. An atheistical presumption on God, that he is not so just
   and holy, or not just and holy in such a way and manner, as he is by
   some represented, is the ground of their persuasion of forgiveness. Men
   think that some declarations of God are fitted only to make them mad;
   that he takes little notice of these things; and that what he doth he
   will easily pass by, as, they suppose, better becomes him. "Come, let
   us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.'?" This is their inward
   thought, "The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil;" which,
   says the psalmist, is men's thinking that God is such a one as
   themselves, Ps. l. 21. They have no deep nor serious thoughts of his
   greatness, holiness, purity, severity, but think that he is like
   themselves, so far as not to be much moved with what they do. What
   thoughts they have of sin, the same they think God hath. If with them a
   slight ejaculation be enough to expiate sin, that their consciences be
   no more troubled, they think it is enough with God that it be not
   punished. The generality of men make light work of sin; and yet in
   nothing doth it more appear what thoughts they have of God. He that
   hath slight thoughts of sin had never great thoughts of God. Indeed,
   men's undervaluing of sin ariseth merely from their contempt of God.
   All sin's concernments flow from its relation unto God; and as men's
   apprehensions are of God, so will they be of sin, which is an
   opposition to him. This is the frame of the most of men, -- they know
   little of God, and are little troubled about any thing that relates
   unto him. God is not reverenced, sin is but a trifle, forgiveness a
   matter of nothing; whoso will may have it for asking. But shall this
   atheistical wickedness of the heart of man be called a discovery of
   forgiveness? Is not this to make God an idol? He who is not acquainted
   with God's holiness and purity, who knows not sin's desert and
   sinfulness, knows nothing of forgiveness.

   2. From the doctrine of the gospel commonly preached and made known,
   there is a general notion begotten in the minds of men that God is
   ready to forgive. Men, I say, from hence have a doctrinal apprehension
   of this truth, without any real, satisfactory foundation of that
   apprehension as to themselves. This they have heard, this they have
   been often told; so they think, and so they resolved to do. A general
   persuasion hereof spreads itself over all to whom the sound of the
   gospel doth come. It is not fiducially resolved into the gospel, but is
   an opinion growing out of the report of it.

   Some relief men find by it in the common course of their conversation,
   in the duties of worship which they do perform, as also in their
   troubles and distresses, whether internal and of conscience, or
   external and of providence, so that they resolve to retain it.

   And this is that which I shall briefly speak unto, and therein manifest
   the differences between this common prevailing apprehension of
   forgiveness, and faith's discovery of it to the soul in its power.

   (1.) That which we reject is loose and general; not fixed, ingrafted,
   or planted on the mind. So is it always where the minds of men receive
   things only in their notion and not in their power. It wants fixedness
   and foundation; which defects accompany all notions of the mind that
   are only retained in the memory, not implanted in the judgment. They
   have general thoughts of it, which they use as occasion serves. They
   hear that God is a merciful God, and as such they intend to deal with
   him. For the true bottom, rise, and foundation of it, -- whence or on
   what account the pure and holy God, who will do no iniquity, the
   righteous God, whose judgment it is that they that commit sin are
   worthy of death, should yet pardon iniquity, transgression, and sin, --
   they weigh it not, they consider it not; or, if they do, it is in a
   slight and notional way, as they consider the thing itself. They take
   it for granted so it is, and are never put seriously upon the inquiry
   how it comes to be so; and that because indeed they have no real
   concernment in it. How many thousands may we meet withal who take it
   for granted that forgiveness is to be had with God, that never yet had
   any serious exercise in their souls about the grounds of it, and its
   consistency with his holiness and justice! But those that know it by
   faith have a sense of it fixed particularly and distinctly on their
   minds. They have been put upon an inquiry into the rise and grounds of
   it in Christ; so that on a good and unquestionable foundation they can
   go to God and say, "There is forgiveness with thee." They see how and
   by what means more glory comes unto God by forgiveness than by
   punishing of sin; which is a matter that the other sort of men are not
   at all solicitous about. If they may escape punishment, whether God
   have any glory or no, for the most part they are indifferent.

   (2.) The first apprehension ariseth without any trial upon inquiry in
   the consciences of them in whom it is. They have not, by the power of
   their convictions and distresses of conscience, been put to make
   inquiry whether this thing be so or no. It is not a persuasion that
   they have arrived unto in a way of seeking satisfaction to their own
   souls. It is not the result of a deep inquiry after peace and rest. It
   is antecedent unto trial and experience, and so is not faith, but
   opinion; for although faith be not experience, yet it is inseparable
   from it, as is every practical habit. Distresses in their consciences
   have been prevented by this opinion, not removed. The reason why the
   most of men are not troubled about their sins to any purpose, is from a
   persuasion that God is merciful and will pardon; when indeed none can
   really, on a gospel account, ordinarily, have that persuasion, but
   those who have been troubled for sin, and that to the purpose. So is it
   with them that make this discovery by faith. They have had conflicts in
   their own spirits, and, being deprived of peace, have accomplished a
   diligent search whether forgiveness were to he obtained or no. The
   persuasion they have of it, be it more or less, is the issue of a trial
   they have had in their own souls, of an inquiry how things stood
   between God and them as to peace and acceptation of their persons. This
   is a vast difference. The one sort might possibly have had trouble in
   their consciences about sin, had it not been for their opinion of
   forgiveness. This hath prevented or stifled their convictions; -- not
   healed their wounds, which is the work of the gospel; but kept them
   from being wounded, which is the work of security. Yea, here lies the
   ruin of the most of them who perish under the preaching of the gospel.
   They have received the general notion of pardon; it floats in their
   minds, and presently presents itself to their relief on all occasions.
   Doth God at any time, in the dispensation of the word, under an
   affliction, upon some great sin against their ruling light, begin to
   deal with their consciences? -- before their conviction can ripen or
   come to any perfection, before it draw nigh to its perfect work, they
   choke it, and heal their consciences with this notion of pardon. Many a
   man, between the assembly and his dwelling-house, is thus cured. You
   may see them go away shaking their heads, and striking on their
   breasts, and before they come home be as whole as ever. "Well, God is
   merciful, there is pardon," hath wrought the cure. The other sort have
   obtained their persuasion as a result of the discovery of Christ in the
   gospel, upon a full conviction. Trials they have had, and this is the
   issue.

   (3.) The one which we reject worketh no love to God, no delight in him,
   no reverence of him, but rather a contempt and commonness of spirit in
   dealing with him. There are none in the world that deal worse with God
   than those who have an ungrounded persuasion of forgiveness. And if
   they do fear him, or love him, or obey him in any thing, more or less,
   it is on other motives and considerations, which will not render any
   thing they do acceptable, and not at all on this. As he is good to the
   creation, they may love, as he is great and powerful, they may fear
   him; but sense of pardon, as to any such ends or purposes, hath no
   power upon them. Carnal boldness, formality, and despising of God, are
   the common issues of such a notion and persuasion. Indeed, this is the
   generation of great sinners in the world; men who have a general
   apprehension, but not a sense of the special power of pardon, openly or
   secretly, in fleshly or spiritual sins, are the great sinners among
   men. Where faith makes a discovery of forgiveness, all things are
   otherwise. Great love, fear, and reverence of God, are its attendants.
   Mary Magdalene loved much, because much was forgiven. Great love will
   spring out of great forgiveness. "There is forgiveness with thee,"
   saith the psalmist, "that thou mayest be feared." No unbeliever doth
   truly and experimentally know the truth of this inference. But so it is
   when men "fear the Lord, and his goodness," Hos. iii. 5. I say, then,
   where pardoning mercy is truly apprehended, where faith makes a
   discovery of it to the soul, it is endeared unto God, and possessed of
   the great springs of love, delight, fear, and reverence, Ps. cxvi. 1,
   5-7.

   (4.) This notional apprehension of the pardon of sin begets no serious,
   thorough hatred and detestation of sin, nor is prevalent to a
   relinquishment of it; nay, it rather secretly insinuates into the soul
   encouragements unto a continuance in it. It is the nature of it to
   lessen and extenuate sin, and to support the soul against its
   convictions. So Jude tells us, that some "turn the grace of God into
   lasciviousness," verse 4; and says he, "They are ungodly men;' let them
   profess what they will, they are ungodly men." But how can they turn
   the grace of our God into lasciviousness? Is grace capable of a
   conversion into lust or sin? Will what was once grace ever become
   wantonness? It is objective, not subjective grace, the doctrine, not
   the real substance of grace, that is intended. The doctrine of
   forgiveness is this grace of God, which may be thus abused. From hence
   do men who have only a general notion of it habitually draw secret
   encouragements to sin and folly. Paul also lets us know that carnal
   men, coming to a doctrinal acquaintance with gospel grace, are very apt
   to make such conclusions, Rom. vi. 1. And it will appear at the last
   day how unspeakably this glorious grace hath been perverted in the
   world. It would be well for many if they had never heard the name of
   forgiveness. It is otherwise where this revelation is received indeed
   in the soul by believing, Rom. vi. 14. Our being under grace, under the
   power of the belief of forgiveness, is our great preservative from our
   being under the power of sin. Faith of forgiveness is the principle of
   gospel obedience, Tit. ii. 11, 12.

   (5.) The general notion of forgiveness brings with it no sweetness, no
   rest to the soul. Flashes of joy it may, abiding rest it doth not. The
   truth of the doctrine fluctuates to and fro in the minds of those that
   have it, but their wills and affections have no solid delight nor rest
   by it. Hence, notwithstanding all that profession that is made in the
   world of forgiveness, the most of men ultimately resolve their peace
   and comfort unto themselves. As their apprehensions are of their own
   doing, good or evil, according to their ruling light, whatever it be,
   so as to peace and rest are they secretly tossed up and down. Every one
   in his several way pleaseth himself with what he doth in answer unto
   his own convictions, and is disquieted as to his state and condition,
   according as he seems to himself to come short thereof To make a full
   life of contentation upon pardon, they know not how to do it. One duty
   yields them more true repose than many thoughts of forgiveness. But
   faith finds sweetness and rest in it; being thereby apprehended, it is
   the only harbour of the soul. It leads a man to God as good, to Christ
   as rest. Fading evanid joys do ofttimes attend the one; but solid
   delight, with constant obedience, are the fruits only of the other.

   (6.) Those who have the former only take up their persuasion on false
   grounds, though the thing itself be true; and they cannot but use it
   unto false ends and purposes, besides its natural and genuine tendency.
   For their grounds, they will be discovered when I come to treat of the
   true nature of gospel forgiveness. For the end, it is used generally
   only to fill up what is wanting. Self-righteousness is their bottom;
   and when that is too short or narrow to cover them, they piece it out
   by forgiveness. Where conscience accuses, this must supply the defect.
   Faith lays it on its proper foundation, of which afterwards also; and
   it useth it to its proper end, -- namely, to be the sole and only
   ground of our acceptation with God. That is the proper use of
   forgiveness, that all may be of grace; for when the foundation is
   pardon, the whole superstructure must needs be grace. From what hath
   been spoken it is evident that, notwithstanding the pretences to the
   contrary, insinuated in the objection now removed, it is a great thing
   to have gospel forgiveness discovered unto a soul in a saving manner.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The true nature of gospel forgiveness -- Its relation to the goodness,
   grace, and will of God; to the blood of Christ; to the promise of the
   gospel -- The considerations of faith about it.

   The difficulties that lie in the way of faith's discovery of
   forgiveness, whence it appears to be a matter of greater weight and
   importance than it is commonly apprehended to be, have been insisted on
   in the foregoing discourse. There is yet remaining another ground of
   the same truth. Now, this is taken from the nature and greatness of the
   thing itself discovered, -- that is, of forgiveness. To this end I
   shall show what it is, wherein it doth consist, what it comprises and
   relates unto, according to the importance of the second proposition
   before laid down.

   I do not in this place take forgiveness, strictly and precisely, for
   the act of pardoning; nor shall I dispute what that is, and wherein it
   doth consist. Consciences that come with sin-entanglements unto God
   know nothing of such disputes. Nor will this expression, "There is
   forgiveness with God," bear any such restriction as that it should
   regard only actual condonation or pardon. That which I have to do is to
   inquire into the nature of that pardon which poor, convinced, troubled
   souls seek after, and which the Scripture proposeth to them for their
   relief and rest. And I shall not handle this absolutely neither, but in
   relation to the truth under consideration, -- namely, that it is a
   great thing to attain unto a true gospel discovery of forgiveness.

   First, As was showed in the opening of the words, the forgiveness
   inquired after hath relation unto the gracious heart of the Father. Two
   things I understand hereby:-- 1. The infinite goodness and graciousness
   of his nature. 2. The sovereign purpose of his will and grace.

   1. There is considerable in it the infinite goodness of his nature. Sin
   stands in a contrariety unto God. It is a rebellion against his
   sovereignty, an opposition to his holiness, a provocation to his
   justice, a rejection of his yoke, a casting off, what lies in the
   sinner, of that dependence which a creature hath on its Creator. That
   God, then, should have pity and compassion on sinners, in every one of
   whose sins there is all this evil, and inconceivably more than we can
   comprehend, it argues an infinitely gracious, good, and loving heart
   and nature in him; for God doth nothing but suitably to the properties
   of his nature, and from them. All the acts of his will are the effects
   of his nature.

   Now, whatever God proposeth as an encouragement for sinners to come to
   him, that is of, or hath a special influence into, the forgiveness that
   is with him; for nothing can encourage a sinner as such, but under this
   consideration, that it is, or it respects, forgiveness. That this
   graciousness of God's nature lies at the head or spring, and is the
   root from whence forgiveness doth grow, is manifest from that solemn
   proclamation which he made of old of his name, and the revelation of
   his nature therein (for God assuredly is what by himself he is called):
   Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7, "The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious,
   long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for
   thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin." His forgiving
   of iniquity flows from hence, that in his nature he is merciful,
   gracious, long-suffering, abundant in goodness. Were he not so,
   infinite in all these, it were in vain to look for forgiveness from
   him. Having made this known to be his name, and thereby declared his
   nature, he in many places proposeth it as a relief, a refuge for
   sinners, an encouragement to come unto him, and to wait for mercy from
   him: Ps. ix. 10, "They that know thy name will put their trust in
   thee." It will encourage them so to do; others have no foundation of
   their confidence. But if this name of God be indeed made known unto us
   by the Holy Ghost, what can hinder why we should not repair unto him
   and rest upon him? So Isa. l. 10, "Who is among you that feareth the
   Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness,
   and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon
   his God." Not only sinners, but sinners in great distress are here
   spoken unto. Darkness of state or condition, in the Scripture, denotes
   every thing of disconsolation and trouble. To be, then, in darkness,
   where yet there is some light, some relief, though darkness be
   predominant, is sad and disconsolate; but now, not only to be, but also
   to walk, that is, to continue a course in darkness, and that with no
   light, no discovery of help or relief, -- this seems an overwhelming
   condition: yet sinners in this estate are called "to trust in the name
   of the Lord." I have showed before that nothing but forgiveness, or
   that which influenceth it and encourageth to an expectation of it, is
   of any use unto a sinner, much more one in so great distress upon the
   account of sin; yet is such a one here sent only to the name of the
   Lord, wherein his gracious heart and nature is revealed. That, then, is
   the very fountain and spring of forgiveness. And this is that which
   John would work a sense of upon our souls where he tells us that "God
   is love," 1 Epist. iv. 8, or one of an infinitely gracious, tender,
   good, compassionate, loving nature. Infinite goodness and grace is the
   soil wherein forgiveness grows. It is impossible this flower should
   spring from any other root. Unless this be revealed to the soul,
   forgiveness is not revealed. To consider pardon merely as it is
   terminated on ourselves, not as it flows from God, will bring neither
   profit to us nor glory to God.

   And this also (which is our design in hand) will make it appear that
   this discovery of forgiveness whereof we speak is indeed no common
   thing, -- is a great discovery. Let men come, with a sense of the guilt
   of sin, to have deep and serious thoughts of God, they will find it no
   such easy and light matter to have their hearts truly and thoroughly
   apprehensive of this loving and gracious nature of God in reference
   unto pardon. It is an easy matter to say so in common; but the soul
   will not find it so easy to believe it for itself. What hath been
   spoken before concerning the ingrafted notions that are in the minds of
   men about the justice, holiness, and severity of God, will here take
   place. Though men profess that God is gracious, yet that aversation
   which they have unto him and communion with him doth abundantly
   manifest that they do not believe what they say and profess: if they
   did, they could not but delight and trust in him, which they do not;
   for "They that know his name will put their trust in him." So said the
   slothful servant in the gospel, "I knew that thou wast austere, and not
   for me to deal withal." It may be he professed otherwise before, but
   that lay in his heart when it came to the trial. But this, I say, is
   necessary to them unto whom this discovery is to be made, even a
   spiritual apprehension of the gracious, loving heart and nature of God.
   This is the spring of all that follows; and the fountain must needs be
   infinitely sweet from whence such streams do flow. He that considers
   the glorious fabric of heaven and earth, with the things in them
   contained, must needs conclude that they were the product of infinite
   wisdom and power; nothing less or under them could have brought forth
   such an effect. And he that really considereth forgiveness, and looks
   on it with a spiritual eye, must conclude that it comes from infinite
   goodness and grace. And this is that which the hearts of sinners are
   exercised about when they come to deal for pardon: Ps. lxxxvi. 5,
   "Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive;" Neh. ix. 17, "Thou art a
   God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
   kindness;" and Micah vii. 18, "Who is a God like unto thee, that
   pardoneth iniquity? ... because he delighteth in mercy." And God
   encourageth them hereunto wherever he says that he forgives sins and
   blots out iniquities for his own sake or his name's sake; that is, he
   will deal with sinners according to the goodness of his own gracious
   nature. So Hos. xi. 9, "I will not execute the fierceness of mine
   anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not
   man." Were there no more mercy, grace, compassion to be showed in this
   case than it is possible should be treasured up in the heart of a man,
   it would be impossible that Ephraim should be spared; but saith he, "I
   am God, and not man." Consider the infinite largeness, bounty, and
   goodness of the heart of God, and there is yet hope. When a sinner is
   in good earnest seeking after forgiveness, there is nothing he is more
   solicitous about than the heart of God towards him, -- nothing that he
   more labours to have a discovery of; there is nothing that sin and
   Satan labour more to hide from him. This he rolls in his mind, and
   exercises his thoughts about; and if ever that voice of God, Isa.
   xxvii. 4, "Fury is not in me," sound in his heart, he is relieved from
   his great distresses. And the fear of our hearts in this matter our
   Saviour seems to intend the prevention or a removal of: John xvi. 26,
   27, "I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you; for the
   Father himself loveth you." They had good thoughts of the tender heart
   and care of Christ himself, the mediator, towards them; but what is the
   heart of the Father? what acceptance shall they find with him? Will
   Christ pray that they may find favour with him? Why, saith he, as to
   the love of his heart, "There is no need of it; for the Father himself
   loveth you.' If this, then, belongeth to forgiveness, as whoever bath
   sought for it knoweth that it doth, it is certainly no common discovery
   to have it revealed unto us.

   To have all the clouds and darkness that are raised by sin between us
   and the throne of God dispelled; to have the fire, and storms, and
   tempests, that are kindled and stirred up about him by the law removed;
   to have his glorious face unvailed, and his holy heart laid open, and a
   view given of those infinite treasures and stores of goodness, mercy,
   love, and kindness which have had an unchangeable habitation therein
   from all eternity; to have a discovery of these eternal springs of
   forbearance and forgiveness, -- is that which none but Christ can
   accomplish and bring about, John xvii. 6.

   2. This is not all. This eternal ocean, that is infinitely satisfied
   with its own fulness and perfection, doth not naturally yield forth
   streams for our refreshment. Mercy and pardon do not come forth from
   God as light doth from the sun or water from the sea, by a necessary
   consequence of their natures, whether they will or no. It doth not
   necessarily follow that any one must be made partaker of forgiveness
   because God is infinitely gracious; for may he not do what he will with
   his own? "Who hath first given unto him, that it should be recompensed
   unto him again.?" Rom. xi. 35. All the fruits of God's goodness and
   grace are in the sole keeping of his own sovereign will and pleasure.
   This is his great glory: Exod. xxxiii. 18, 19, "Show me thy glory,"
   saith Moses. "And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before
   thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Load before thee; and I will
   be gracious to whom I will be gracious." Upon that proclamation of the
   name of God, that he is merciful, gracious, long-suffering, abundant in
   goodness, some might conclude that it could not be otherwise with any
   but well; -- he is such a one as that men need scarce be beholding to
   him for mercy. "Nay," saith he; "but this is my great glory, that I
   will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.' There must be an
   interposition of a free act of the will of God to deal with us
   according to this his abundant goodness, or we can have no interest
   therein. This I call the purpose of his grace, or "The good pleasure
   which he hath purposed in himself," Eph. i. 9; or, as it is termed,
   verses 5, 6, "The good pleasure of his will," that he hath purposed "to
   the praise of his glorious grace." This free and gracious pleasure of
   God, or purpose of his will to act towards sinners according to his own
   abundant goodness, is another thing that influences the forgiveness of
   which we treat. Pardon flows immediately from a sovereign act of free
   grace. This free purpose of God's will and grace for the pardoning of
   sinners is indeed that which is principally intended when we say,
   "There is forgiveness with him;" that is, he is pleased to forgive, and
   so to do is agreeable unto his nature. Now, the mystery of this grace
   is deep; it is eternal, and therefore incomprehensible. Few there are
   whose hearts are raised to a contemplation of it. Men rest and content
   themselves in a general notion of mercy, which will not be advantageous
   to their souls. Freed they would be from punishment, but what it is to
   be forgiven they inquire not. So what they know of it they come easily
   by, but will find in the issue it will stand them in little stead. But
   these fountains of God's actings are revealed, that they may be the
   fountains of our comforts.

   Now, of this purpose of God's grace there are several acts, all of them
   relating unto gospel forgiveness:--

   (1.) There is his purpose of sending his Son to be the great means of
   procuring, of purchasing forgiveness. Though God be infinitely and
   incomprehensibly gracious, though he purpose to exert his grace and
   goodness toward sinners, yet he will so do it, do it in such a way, as
   shall not be prejudicial to his own holiness and righteousness. His
   justice must be satisfied, and his holy indignation against sin made
   known. Wherefore he purposeth to send his Son, and hath sent him, to
   make way for the exercise of mercy; so as no way to eclipse the glory
   of his justice, holiness, and hatred of sin. Better we should all
   eternally come short of forgiveness than that God should lose any thing
   of his glory. This we have, Rom. iii. 25, "God set him forth to be a
   propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness
   for the remission of sins that are past." The remission of sins is the
   thing aimed at; but this must be so brought about as that therein not
   only the mercy but the righteousness of God may be declared, and
   therefore must it be brought forth by a propitiation, or making of an
   atonement in the blood of Christ: so John iii 16; 1 John iv. 9; Rom. v.
   8. This, I say, also lies in the mystery of that forgiveness that is
   administered in the gospel, -- it comes forth from this eternal purpose
   of making way by the blood of Christ to the dispensation of pardon. And
   this greatly heightens the excellency of this discovery. Men who have
   slight thoughts of God, whose hearts were never awed with his dread or
   greatness, who never seriously considered his purity and holiness, may
   think it no great matter that God should pardon sin, But do they
   consider the way whereby it is to be brought about? -- even by the
   sending of his only Son, and that to die, as we shall see afterward.
   Neither was there any other way whereby it might be done. Let us now
   lay aside common thoughts, assent upon reports and tradition, and
   rightly weigh this matter. Doubtless we shall find it to be a great
   thing, that forgiveness should be so with God as to be made out unto us
   (we know somewhat what we are) by sending his only Son to die. Oh, how
   little is this really believed, even by them who make a profession of
   it! and what mean thoughts are entertained about it when men seek for
   pardon! Immunity from punishment is the utmost that lies in the alms
   and desires of most, and is all that they are exercised in the
   consideration of, when they deal with God about sin. Such men think,
   and will do so, that we have an easy task in hand, -- namely, to prove
   that there is forgiveness in God; but this ease lies in their own
   ignorance and darkness. If ever they come to search after it indeed, to
   inquire into the nature, reasons, causes, fountains, and springs of it,
   they will be able to give another account of these things. Christ is
   the centre of the mystery of the gospel, and forgiveness is laid up in
   the heart of Christ, from the love of the Father; in him are all the
   treasures of it hid. And surely it is no small thing to have the heart
   of Christ revealed unto us. When believers deal about pardon, their
   faith exercises itself about this, that God, with whom the soul hath to
   do, hath sent the Lord Christ to die for this end, that it may be
   freely given out. General notions of impunity they dwell not on, they
   pass [press?] not for; they have a closer converse with God than to be
   satisfied with such thoughts. They inquire into the graciousness of his
   nature, and the good pleasure of his will, the purpose of his grace;
   they ponder and look into the mystery of his wisdom and love in sending
   his Son. If these springs be not clear unto them, the streams will
   yield them but little refreshment. It is not enough that we seek after
   salvation, but we are to inquire and search diligently into the nature
   and manner of it. These are the things that "the angels desire to" how
   down and "look into," 1 Pet. i. 11, 12. And some think if they have got
   a form of words about them, they have gotten a sufficient comprehension
   of them! It is doubtless one reason why many who truly believe do yet
   so fluctuate about forgiveness all their days, that they never
   exercised faith to look into the springs of it, its eternal fountains,
   but have merely dwelt on actual condonation. However, I say, these
   things lie utterly out of the consideration of the common pretenders to
   an acquaintance with the truth we have in hand.

   (2.) There is another sovereign act, of God's will to be considered in
   this matter, and that is his eternal designation of the persons who
   shall be made partakers of this mercy. He hath not left this thing to
   hazard and uncertainties, that it should, as it were, be unknown to him
   who should be pardoned and who not. Nay, none ever are made partakers
   of forgiveness but those whom he hath eternally and graciously designed
   thereunto: so the apostle declares it, Eph. i. 5-7. The rise is his
   eternal predestination; the end, the glory of his grace; the means,
   redemption in the blood of Christ; the thing itself, forgiveness of
   sins. None ever are or can be made partakers thereof but by virtue of
   this act of God's will and grace; which thereupon hath a peculiar
   influence into it, and is to be respected in the consideration of it. I
   know this may be abused by pride, profaneness, and unbelief, and so may
   the whole work of God's grace, -- and so it is, even the blood of
   Christ in an especial manner; but in its proper place and use it hath a
   signal influence into the glory of God and the consolation of the souls
   of men.

   There are also other acts of this purpose of God's grace, as of giving
   sinners unto Christ and giving sinners an interest in Christ, which I
   shall not insist upon, because the nature of them is sufficiently
   discovered in that one explained already.

   Secondly, Forgiveness hath respect unto the propitiation made in and by
   the blood of Christ the Son of God. This was declared in the opening of
   the words. Indeed, here lies the knot and centre of gospel forgiveness.
   It flows from the cross, and springs out of the grave of Christ.

   Thus Elihu describes it, Job xxxiii. 24, "God is gracious unto him, and
   saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom."
   The whole of what is aimed at lies in these words:-- 1. There is God's
   gracious and merciful heart towards a sinner: "He is gracious unto
   him." 2. There is actual condonation itself, of which we shall treat
   afterward: "He saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit." And, --
   3. There is the centre of the whole, wherein God's gracious heart and
   actual pardon do meet; and that is the ransom, the propitiation or
   atonement that is in the blood of Christ, of which we speak: "I have
   found a ransom."

   The same is expressed, Isa. liii. 11, "My righteous servant shall
   justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities." Of the justification
   of sinners, absolution or pardon is the first part. This ariseth from
   Christ's bearing their iniquities Therein he "finished the
   transgression, made an end of sins, and made reconciliation for
   iniquity," Dan. ix. 24. Even all the sacrifices, and so consequently
   the whole worship of the Old Testament, evinced this relation between
   forgiveness and blood-shedding; whence the apostle concludes that
   "without shedding of blood is no remission," Heb. ix. 22; -- that is,
   all pardon ariseth from blood-shedding, even of the blood of the Son of
   God; so that we are said "in him to have redemption, even the
   forgiveness of sins," Eph. i. 7. Our redemption in his blood is our
   forgiveness: not that we are all actually pardoned in the blood of his
   cross, for thereunto must be added gospel condonation, of which
   afterward; but thereby it is procured, the grant of pardon is therein
   sealed, and security given that it shall in due time be made out unto
   us. To which purpose is that discourse of the apostle, Rom. iii. 24-26.
   The work there mentioned proceeds from grace, is managed to the
   interest of righteousness, is carried on by the blood of Christ, and
   issues in forgiveness. Now, the blood of Christ relates variously to
   the pardon of sin:--

   1. Pardon is purchased and procured by it. Our redemption is our
   forgiveness, as the cause contains the effect. No soul is pardoned but
   with respect unto the blood of Christ as the procuring cause of that
   pardon. Hence he is said to have "washed us in his blood," Rev. i. 5;
   "by himself to have purged our sins," Heb. i. 3; "by one offering" to
   have taken away sin, and to have "perfected for ever them that are
   sanctified," Heb. x. 14; to be the ransom and "propitiation for our
   sins," 1 John ii. 2; to have "made an end of sins," Dan. ix. 24; and to
   have "made reconciliation for the sins of the people," Heb. ii. 17. God
   hath enclosed his rich stores of pardon and mercy in the blood of
   Jesus.

   2. Because in his blood the promise of pardon is ratified and
   confirmed, so that nothing is wanting to our complete forgiveness but
   our pleading the promise by faith in him: 2 Cor. i. 20, "All the
   promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen;" that is, faithfully,
   and irrevocably, and immutably established. And therefore the apostle
   having told us that this is the covenant of God, that he would be
   "merciful to our sins and iniquities," Heb. viii. 12, he informs us
   that in the undertaking of Christ this covenant is become a testament,
   chap. ix. 15-17; so ratified in his blood, that mercy and forgiveness
   of sin is irrevocably confirmed unto us therein.

   3. Because he hath in his own person, as the head of the church,
   received an acquitment for the whole body. His personal discharge, upon
   the accomplishment of his work, was a pledge of the discharge which was
   in due time to be given to his whole mystical body. Peter tells us,
   Acts ii. 24, that it was impossible he should be detained by death. And
   why so? Because death being penally inflicted on him, when he had paid
   the debt he was legally to be acquitted. Now, for whom and in whose
   name and stead he suffered, for them and in their name and stead he
   received this acquitment.

   4. Because upon his death, God the Father hath committed unto him the
   whole management of the business of forgiveness: Acts v. 31, he now
   gives "repentance" and the "forgiveness of sins." It is Christ that
   forgives us, Col. iii. 13. All forgiveness is now at his disposal, and
   he pardoneth whom he will, even all that are given unto him of the
   Father, not casting out any that come to God by him. He is intrusted
   with all the stores of his Father's purpose and his own purchase; and
   thence tells us that "all things that the Father hath are his," John
   xvi. 15.

   In all these respects doth forgiveness relate to the blood of Christ.
   Mercy, pardon, and grace could find no other way to issue forth from
   the heart of the Father but by the heart-blood of the Son; and so do
   they stream unto the heart of the sinner.

   Two things are principally to be considered in the respect that
   forgiveness hath to the blood of Christ -- (1.) The way of its
   procurement; (2.) The way of its administration by him. The first is
   deep, mysterious, dreadful. It was by his blood, the blood of the
   cross, the travail of his soul, his undergoing wrath and curse. The
   other is gracious, merciful, and tender; whence so many things are
   spoken of his mercifulness and faithfulness, to encourage us to expect
   forgiveness from him.

   This also adds to the mysterious depths of forgiveness, and makes its
   discovery a great matter. The soul that looks after it in earnest must
   consider what it cost. How light do most men make of pardon! What an
   easy thing is it to be acquainted with it! and no very hard matter to
   obtain it! But to hold communion with God, in the blood of his Son, is
   a thing of another nature than is once dreamed of by many who think
   they know well enough what it is to be pardoned. "God be merciful," is
   a common saying; and as common to desire he would be so "for Christ's
   sake." Poor creatures are east into the mould of such expressions, who
   know neither God, nor mercy, nor Christ, nor any thing of the mystery
   of the gospel. Others look on the outside of the cross. To see into the
   mystery of the love of the Father, working in the Mood of the Mediator;
   to consider by faith the great transaction of divine wisdom, justice,
   and mercy therein, -- how few attain unto it! To come unto God by
   Christ for forgiveness, and therein to behold the law issuing all its
   threats and curses in his Mood, and losing its sting, putting an end to
   its obligation unto punishment, in the cross; to see all sins gathered
   up in the hands of God's justice, and made to meet on the Mediator, and
   eternal love springing forth triumphantly from his Mood, flourishing
   into pardon, grace, mercy, forgiveness, -- this the heart of a sinner
   can be enlarged unto only by the Spirit of God.

   Thirdly, There is in forgiveness free condonation, discharge, or
   pardon, according to the tenor of the gospel; and this may be
   considered two ways:--

   1. As it lies in the promise itself; and so it is God's gracious
   declaration of pardon to sinners, in and by the blood of Christ, his
   covenant to that end and purpose, which is variously proposed,
   according as he knew [to be] needful for all the ends and purposes of
   ingenerating faith, and communicating that consolation which he intends
   therein.

   This is the law of his grace, the declaration of the mystery of his
   love, before insisted on.

   2. There is the bringing home and application of all this mercy to the
   soul of a sinner by the Holy Ghost, wherein we are freely forgiven all
   our trespasses, Col. ii. 13.

   Gospel forgiveness I say, respects all these things, these principles;
   they have all an influence into it. And that which makes this more
   evident (wherewith I shall close this consideration of the nature of
   it), is, that faith, in its application of itself unto God about and
   for forgiveness, doth distinctly apply itself unto and close with
   sometimes one of these severally and singly, sometimes another, and
   sometimes jointly takes in the consideration of them all expressly. Not
   that at any time it fixes on any or either of them exclusively to the
   others, but that eminently it finds some special encouragement at some
   season, and some peculiar attractive, from some one of them, more than
   from the rest; and then that proves an inlet, a door of entrance, unto
   the treasures that are laid up in the rest of them. Let us go over the
   severals by instances:--

   (1.) Sometimes faith fixes upon the name and infinite goodness of the
   nature of God, and draws out forgiveness from thence. So doth the
   psalmist: Ps. lxxxvi. 5, "Thou, Lord, art good and ready to forgive."
   He rolls himself, in the pursuit and expectation of pardon, on the
   infinite goodness of the nature of God. So Neh. ix. 17, "Thou art a God
   of pardons," or ready to forgive, -- of an infinite gracious, loving
   nature, -- not severe and wrathful; and this is that which we are
   encouraged unto, Isa. l. 10, to stay on the name of God, as in
   innumerable other places.

   And thus faith oftentimes finds a peculiar sweetness and encouragement
   in and from the consideration of God's gracious nature. Sometimes this
   is the first thing it fixes on, and sometimes the last that it rests
   in. And ofttimes it makes a stay here, when it is driven from all other
   holds; it can say, however it be, "Yet God is gracious;" and at least
   make that conclusion which we have from it, Joel ii. 13, 14, "God is
   gracious and merciful; who knoweth but he will returns." And when faith
   hath well laid hold on this consideration, it will not easily be driven
   from its expectation of relief and forgiveness even from hence.

   (2.) Sometimes the soul by faith addresseth itself in a peculiar manner
   to the sovereignty of God's will, whereby he is gracious to whom he
   will be gracious, and merciful to whom he will be merciful; which, as
   was showed, is another considerable spring or principle of forgiveness.
   This way David's faith steered him in his great strait and perplexity:
   2 Sam. xv. 25, 26, "If I shall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he
   will bring me again. But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee;
   behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him." That
   which he hath in consideration is whether God hath any delight in him
   or no; that is, whether God would graciously remit and pardon the great
   sin against which at that time he manifesteth his indignation. Here he
   lays himself down before the sovereign grace of God, and awaits
   patiently the discovery of the free act of his will concerning him; and
   at this door, as it were, enters into the consideration of those other
   springs of pardon which faith inquires after and closeth withal. This
   sometimes is all the cloud that appears to a distressed soul, which
   after a while fills the heavens by the addition of the other
   considerations mentioned, and yields plentiful refreshing showers. And
   this condition is a sin-entangled soul ofttimes reduced unto in looking
   out for relief, -- it can discover nothing but this, that God is able,
   and can, if he graciously please, relieve and acquit him. All other
   supportments, all springs of relief, are shut up or hid from him. The
   springs, indeed, may be nigh, as that was to Hagar, but their eyes are
   withheld that they cannot see them. Wherefore they cast themselves on
   God's sovereign pleasure, and say with Job," Though he slay us, yet
   will we trust in him;' we will not let him go. In ourselves we are
   lost, that is unquestionable. How the Lord will deal with us we know
   not; we see not our signs and tokens any more. Evidences of God's grace
   in us, or of his love and favour unto us, are all out of sight. To a
   present special interest in Christ we are strangers; and we lie every
   moment at the door of eternity. What course shall we take? what way
   shall we proceed? If we abide at a distance from God, we shall
   assuredly perish. Who ever hardened himself against him and prospered?'
   Nor is there the least relief to be had but from and by him, for who
   can forgive sins but God?' We will, then, bring our guilty souls into
   his presence, and attend the pleasure of his grace; what he speaks
   concerning us, we will willingly submit unto." And this sometimes
   proves an anchor to a tossed soul, which, though it gives it not rest
   and peace, yet it saves it from the rock of despair. Here it abides
   until light do more and more break forth upon it.

   (3.) Faith dealing about forgiveness doth commonly eye, in a particular
   manner, its relation to the mediation and blood of Christ. So the
   apostle directs, 1 John ii. 1, 2, "If any man sin, we have an advocate
   with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation
   for our sins." If any one hath sinned, and is in depths and
   entanglements about it, what course shall he take, how shall he
   proceed, to obtain deliverance? Why, he must unto God for pardon. But
   what shall he rely upon to encourage him in his so doing? Saith the
   apostle, "Consider by faith the atonement and propitiation made for sin
   by the blood of Christ, and that he is still pursuing the work of love
   to the suing out of pardon for us; and rest thy soul thereon." This, I
   say, most commonly is that which faith in the first place immediately
   fixes on.

   (4.) Faith eyes actual pardon or condonation. So God proposeth it as a
   motive to farther believing: Isa. xliv. 22, "I have blotted out, as a
   thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto
   me; for I have redeemed thee." Actual pardon of sin is proposed to
   faith as an encouragement unto a full returning unto God in all things,
   2 Sam. xxiii. 5. And the like may be said of all the other particulars
   which we have insisted on. There is not any of them But will yield
   peculiar relief unto a soul dealing with God about forgiveness, as
   having some one special concernment or other of forgiveness inwrapped
   in them; -- only, as I said, they do it not exclusively, but axe the
   special doors whereby believing enters into the whole. And these things
   must be spoken unto afterward.

   Let us now take along with us the end for which all these
   considerations have been insisted on. It is to manifest that a real
   discovery of gospel forgiveness is a matter of greater consequence and
   importance than at first proposal, it may be, it appeared unto some to
   be. Who is not in hopes, in expectation of pardon? Who think not that
   they know well enough at least what it is, if they might but obtain it?
   But men may have general thoughts of impunity, and yet be far enough
   from any saving acquaintance with gospel mercy.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Forgiveness discovered or revealed only to faith -- Reasons thereof.

   For a close of this discourse, I shall only add what is included in
   that proposition which is the foundation of the whole, -- namely, that
   this discovery of forgiveness is and can be made to faith alone. The
   nature of it is such as that nothing else can discover it or receive
   it. No reasonings, no inquiries of the heart of man can reach unto it.
   That guess or glimpse which the heathens had of old of somewhat so
   called, and which false worshippers have at present, is not the
   forgiveness we insist upon, but a mere imagination of their own hearts.

   This the apostle informs us, Rom. i. 17, "The righteousness of God is"
   (in the gospel) "revealed from faith to faith." Nothing but faith hath
   any thing to do with it. It is that righteousness of God whereof he
   speaks that consists in the forgiveness of sins by the blood of Christ,
   declared in the gospel. And this is revealed from the faith of God in
   the promise to the faith of the believer, -- to him that mixes the
   promise with faith. And again more fully, 1 Cor. ii. 9, "Eye hath not
   seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the
   things which God hath prepared for them that love him." The ways
   whereby we may come to the knowledge of any thing are, by the seeing of
   the eye or hearing of the ear, or the reasonings and meditations of the
   heart; but now none of these will reach to the matter in hand, -- by
   none of these ways can we come to an acquaintance with the things of
   the gospel that are prepared for us in Christ. How, then, shall we
   obtain the knowledge of them? That he declares, verse 10, "God hath
   revealed them unto us by his Spirit." Now, it is faith only that
   receives the revelations of the Spirit; nothing else hath to do with
   them.

   To give evidence hereunto, we may consider that this great mystery, --
   1. Is too deep, 2. Is too great, for aught else to discover; and, -- 3.
   That nothing else but faith is suited to the making of this discovery.

   1. It is too deep and mysterious to be fathomed and reached by any
   thing else. Reason's line is too short to fathom the depths of the
   Father's love, of the blood of the Son, and the promises of the gospel
   built thereon, wherein forgiveness dwells. Men cannot by their rational
   considerations launch out into these deeps, nor draw water by them from
   these "wells of salvation." Reason stands by amazed, and cries, "How
   can these things be?" It can but gather cockleshells, like him of old,
   at the shore of this ocean, a few criticisms upon the outward letter,
   and so bring an evil report upon the land, as did the spies. All it can
   do is but to hinder faith from venturing into it, crying, "Spare
   thyself; this attempt is vain, these things are impossible." It is
   among the things that faith puts off and lays aside when it engageth
   the soul into this great work. This, then, that it may come to a
   discovery of forgiveness, causeth the soul to deny itself and all its
   own reasonings, and to give up itself to an infinite fulness of
   goodness and truth. Though it cannot go unto the bottom of these
   depths, yet it enters into them, and finds rest in them. Nothing but
   faith is suited to rest, to satiate, and content itself in mysterious,
   bottomless, unsearchable depths. Being a soul-emptying, a
   reason-denying grace, the more it meets withal beyond its search and
   reach, the more satisfaction it finds. "This is that which I looked
   for," saith faith, "even for that which is infinite and unsearchable,
   when I know that there is abundantly more beyond me that I do not
   comprehend, than what I have attained unto; for I know that nothing
   else will do good to the soul." Now, tiffs is that which really puzzles
   and overwhelms reason, rendering it useless. What it cannot compass, it
   will neglect or despise. It is either amazed and confounded, and
   dazzled like weak eyes at too great a light; or fortifying of itself by
   inbred pride and obstinacy, it concludes that this preaching of the
   cross, of forgiveness from the love of God, by the blood of Christ, is
   plain folly, a thing not for a wise man to take notice of or to trouble
   himself about: so it appeared to the wise Greeks of old, 1 Cor. i. 23.
   Hence, when a soul is brought under the power of a real conviction of
   sin, so as that it would desirously be freed from the galling
   entanglements of it, it is then the hardest thing in the world to
   persuade such a soul of this forgiveness. Any thing appears more
   rational unto it, -- any self-righteousness in this world, any
   purgatory hereafter.

   The greatest part of the world of convinced persons have forsaken
   forgiveness on this account; masses, penances, merits, have appeared
   more eligible. Yea, men who have no other desire but to be forgiven do
   choose to close with any thing rather than forgiveness. If men do
   escape these rocks, and resolve that nothing but pardon will relieve
   them, yet it is impossible for them to receive it in the truth and
   power of it, if not enabled by faith thereunto. I speak not of men that
   take it up by hearsay, as a common report, but of those souls who find
   themselves really concerned to look after it. When they know it is
   their sole concernment, all their hope and relief; when they know that
   they must perish everlastingly without it; and when it is declared unto
   them in the words of truth and soberness, -- yet they cannot receive
   it. What is the reason of it? what staves off these hungry creatures
   from their proper food? Why, they have nothing to lead them into the
   mysterious depths of eternal love, of the blood of Christ, and promises
   of the gospel. How may we see poor deserted souls standing every day at
   the side of this pool, and yet not once venture themselves into it all
   their days!

   2. It is too great for any thing else to discover. Forgiveness is a
   thing chosen out of God from all eternity, to exalt and magnify the
   glory of his grace; and it will be made appear to all the world at the
   day of judgment to have been a great thing. When the soul comes in any
   measure to be made sensible of it, it finds it so great, so excellent
   and astonishable, that it sinks under the thoughts of it. It hath
   dimensions, a length, breadth, depth, and height, that no line of the
   rational soul can take or measure. There is "exceeding greatness" in
   it, Eph. i. 19. That is a great work which we have prescribed, Eph.
   iii. 19, even "to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge."
   Here, I suppose, reason will confess itself at a stand and an issue; to
   know that which passeth knowledge is none of its work. "It cannot be
   known," saith reason; and so ends the matter. But this is faith's
   proper work, even to know that which passeth knowledge; to know that,
   in its power, virtue, sweetness, and efficacy, which cannot be
   thoroughly known in its nature and excellency; to have, by believing,
   all the ends of a full comprehension of that which cannot be fully
   comprehended. Hence, Heb. xi. 1, it is said to be the hupostasis of
   "things not seen," their subsistence; though in themselves absent, yet
   faith gives them a present subsistence in the soul. So it knows things
   that pass knowledge; by mixing itself with them, it draws out and
   communicates their benefit to the soul. From all which is evident what
   in the third place was proposed, of faith's being only suited to be the
   means of this discovery; so that I shall not need farther to insist
   thereon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Discovery of forgiveness in God a great supportment to sin-entangled
   souls -- Particular assurance attainable.

   Fourthly. There yet remains a brief confirmation of the position [3] at
   first laid down and thus cleared, before I come to the improvement of
   the words, especially aimed at. I say, then, this discovery of
   forgiveness in God is a great supportment for a sin-entangled soul,
   although it hath no special persuasion of its own particular interest
   therein. Somewhat is supposed in this assertion, and somewhat affirmed.

   First, [As to what is supposed]:--

   1. It is supposed that there may be a gracious persuasion and assurance
   of faith in a man concerning his own particular interest in
   forgiveness. A man may, many do, believe it for themselves, so as not
   only to have the benefit of it but the comfort also. Generally, all the
   saints mentioned in Scripture had this assurance, unless it were in the
   case of depths, distresses, and desertions, such as that in this psalm.
   David expresseth his confidence of the love and favour of God unto his
   own soul hundreds of times; Paul doth the same for himself: Gal. ii.
   20, "Christ loved me, and gave himself for me;" 2 Tim. iv. 8, "There is
   laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
   judge, shall give me at that day." And that this boasting in the Lord
   and his grace was not an enclosure to himself he shows, Rom. viii. 38,
   39.

   Nothing can be more vain than what is usually pleaded to remove this
   sheet-anchor of the saints' consolation, -- namely, that no man's
   particular name is in the promise. It is not said to this or that man
   by name that his sins are forgiven him; but the matter is far
   otherwise. To think that it is necessary that the names whereby we are
   known among ourselves, and are distinguished here one from another,
   should be written in the promise, that we may believe in particular
   every child of God is in the promise, is a fond conceit. And believing
   makes it very legible to him. Yea, we find by experience that there is
   no need of argumentation in this case. The soul, by a direct act of
   faith, believes its own forgiveness, without making inferences or
   gathering conclusions; and may do so upon the proposition of it to be
   believed in the promise. But I will not digress from my work in hand,
   and, therefore, shall only observe one or two things upon the
   supposition laid down:--

   (1.) It is the duty of every believer to labour after an assurance of a
   personal interest in forgiveness, and to be diligent in the cherishing
   and preservation of it when it is attained. The apostle exhorts us all
   unto it, Heb. x. 22, "Let us draw near in full assurance of faith;"
   that is, of our acceptance with God through forgiveness in the blood of
   Jesus. This he plainly discourseth of; and this principle of our faith
   and confidence he would have us to hold fast unto the end, chap. iii.
   14. It is no small evil in believers not to be pressing after
   perfection in believing and obedience. Ofttimes some sinful indulgence
   to self, or the world, or sloth, is the cause of it. Hence few come up
   to gospel assurance. But yet most of our privileges, and upon the
   matter all our comforts, depend on this one thing. A little by the way,
   to encourage unto this duty, I shall desire you to consider both whence
   this assurance is produced and what it doth produce, -- what it is the
   fruit of, and what fruit it bears:--

   [1.] It is, in general, the product of a more plentiful communication
   of the Spirit than ordinary, as to a sense and participation of the
   choice fruits of the death of Christ, procured for those who are
   justified by their acceptance of the atonement. It flourisheth not
   without his sealing, witnessing, establishing, and shedding abroad the
   love of God in our hearts. See Rom. v. 1-5. And what believer ought not
   to long for and press after the enjoyment of these things? Nay, to read
   of these things in the gospel, not experiencing them in our own hearts,
   and yet to sit down quietly on this side of them, without continual
   pressing after them, is to despise the blood of Christ, the Spirit of
   grace, and the whole work of God's love. If there are no such things,
   the gospel is not true; if there are, if we press not after them, we
   are despisers of the gospel. Surely he hath not the Spirit who would
   not have more of him, all of him that is promised by Christ. These
   things are the "hundredfold" that Christ hath left us in the world to
   counterpoise our sorrows, troubles, and losses; and shall we be so
   foolish as to neglect our only abiding riches and treasures, -- in
   particular, as it is the product of an exercised, vigorous, active
   faith? That our faith should be such always, in every state and
   condition, I suppose it our duty to endeavour. Not only our comforts
   but our obedience also depends upon it. The more faith that is true and
   of the right kind, the more obedience; for all our obedience is the
   obedience of faith.

   [2.] For its own fruit, and what it produceth, they are the choicest
   actings of our souls towards God, -- as love, delight, rejoicing in the
   Lord, peace, joy, and consolation in ourselves, readiness to do or
   suffer, cheerfulness in so doing. If they grow not from this root, yet
   their flourishing wholly depends upon it; so that surely it is the duty
   of every believer to break through all difficulties in pressing after
   this particular assurance. The objections that persons raise against
   themselves in this case may be afterward considered.

   (2.) In ordinary dispensations of God towards us, and dealings with us,
   it is mostly [by] our own negligence and sloth that we come short of
   this assurance. It is true it depends in a peculiar manner on the
   sovereignty of God. He is as absolute in giving peace to believers as
   in giving grace to sinners. This takes place and may be proposed as a
   relief in times of trial and distress. He createth light and causeth
   darkness, as he pleaseth. But yet, considering what promises are made
   unto us, what encouragements are given us, what love and tenderness
   there is in God to receive us, I cannot but conclude that ordinarily
   the cause of our coming short of this assurance is where I have fixed
   it. And this is the first thing that is supposed in the foregoing
   assertion.

   2. It is supposed that there is or may be a saving persuasion or
   discovery of forgiveness in God, where there is no assurance of any
   particular interest therein, or that our own sins in particular are
   pardoned. This is that which hath a promise of gracious acceptance with
   God, and is therefore saving: Isa. l. 10, "Who is among you that
   feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh
   in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord,
   and stay upon his God." Here is the fear of the Lord and obedience,
   with a blessed encouragement to rest in God and his all-sufficiency,
   yet no assurance nor light, but darkness, and that walked in or
   continued in for a long season; for he cannot walk in darkness, meet
   with nothing but darkness, without any beam or ray of light, as the
   words signify, who is persuaded of the love of God in the pardon of his
   sins. And yet the faith of such a one, and his obedience springing from
   it, have this gracious promise of acceptance with God. And innumerable
   testimonies to this purpose might be produced, and instances in great
   plenty. I shall only tender a little evidence unto it, in one
   observation concerning the nature of faith, and one more about the
   proposal of the thing to be believed, or forgiveness. And, --

   (1.) Faith is called, and is, a cleaving unto the Lord: Deut. iv. 4,
   "Ye that did cleave," or adhere, "unto the Lord;" that is, who did
   believe. Josh. xxiii. 8, "Cleave," or adhere, "unto the Lord your God."
   The same word is used also in the New Testament: Acts xi. 23, "He
   exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto
   the Lord," or continue steadfast in believing. It is also often
   expressed by trusting in the Lord, rolling our burden, or casting our
   care upon him, by committing ourselves or our ways unto him. Now, all
   this goes no farther than the soul's resignation of itself unto God, to
   be dealt withal by him according to the tenor of the covenant of grace,
   ratified in the blood of Christ. This a soul cannot do, without a
   discovery of forgiveness in God; but this a soul may do, without a
   special assurance of his own interest therein. This faith, that thus
   adheres to God, that cleaves to him, will carry men to conclude that it
   is their duty and their wisdom to give up the disposal of their souls
   unto God, and to cleave and adhere unto him as revealed in Christ,
   waiting the pleasure of his will. It enables them to make Christ their
   choice; and will carry men to heaven safely, though it may be at some
   seasons not very comfortably.

   (2.) The revelation and discovery of forgiveness that is made in the
   gospel evidenceth the same truth. The first proposal of it or
   concerning it is not to any man that his sins are forgiven. No; but it
   is only that there is redemption and forgiveness of sins in Christ. So
   the apostle lays it down, Acts xiii. 38, 39, "Be it known unto you
   therefore, men and brethren, that through tiffs man is preached unto
   you the forgiveness of sins: and by him all that believe are justified
   from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of
   Moses" All this may be believed without a man's assurance of his own
   personal interest in the things mentioned. Now, where they are believed
   with the faith the gospel requires, that faith is saving, and the root
   of gospel, acceptable obedience. The ransom, I say, the atonement by
   Christ, the fulness of the redemption that is in him, and so
   forgiveness in his blood for believers, from the good will, grace, and
   love of the Father, is the first gospel discovery that a sinner in a
   saving manner closeth withal. Particular assurance ariseth or may arise
   afterward; and this also is supposed in the assertion.

   Secondly, That which is affirmed in it is, that a discovery of
   forgiveness in God, without any particular assurance of personal
   interest therein, is a great supportment to a sin-entangled soul. And
   let no man despise the day of this small thing; small in the eyes of
   some, and those good men also, as if it did not deserve the name of
   faith. Now, as hath been made to appear, this discovery of forgiveness
   is the soul's persuasion, on gospel grounds, that however it be with
   him, and whatever his state and condition be, or is like to be, yet
   that God in his own nature is infinitely gracious, and that he hath
   determined, in a sovereign act of his will from eternity, to be
   gracious to sinners, and that he hath made way for the administration
   of forgiveness by the blood of his Son, according as he hath abundantly
   manifested and declared in the promises of the gospel. "However it be
   with me, yet thus it is with God; there is forgiveness with him." This
   is the first thing that a soul in its depths riseth up unto; and it is
   a supportment for it, enabling it unto all present duties until
   consolation come from above.

   Thus hath it been to and with the saints of old: Hos. xiv. 3, "Asshur
   shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say
   any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the
   fatherless findeth mercy." A solemn renunciation we have of all other
   helps, reliefs, or assistances, civil or religious, that are not God's;
   thereon a solemn resolution, in their great distress, of cleaving unto
   God alone; -- both which are great and blessed effects of faith. What
   is the bottom and foundation of this blessed resolution? -- namely,
   that proposition, "In thee the fatherless findeth mercy;" that is,
   "There is forgiveness with thee for helpless sinners." This lifted up
   their hearts in their depths, and supported them in waiting unto the
   receiving of the blessed promises of mercy, pardon, grace, and
   holiness, which ensue in the next verses. Until they came home unto
   them in their efficacy and effects, they made a life on this, "In thee
   the fatherless findeth mercy."

   The state and condition of things seem to lie yet lower in that
   proposal we have, Joel ii. 13, 14, "Rend your heart, and not your
   garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and
   merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of
   the evil. Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a
   blessings" That which is proposed to the faith of those here spoken
   unto is, that the Lord is gracious and merciful, -- that there is
   forgiveness in him. The duty they are provoked unto hereupon is gospel
   repentance. The assent unto the proposition demanded, as to their own
   interest, amounts but unto this, "Who knows but that the Lord may
   return, and leave a blessing?" or, "deal with us according to the
   manifestation he hath made of himself, that he is merciful and
   gracious." This is far enough from any comfortable persuasion of a
   particular interest in that grace, mercy, or pardon. But yet, saith the
   prophet, "Come but thus far, and here is a firm foundation of dealing
   with God about farther discoveries of himself in a way of grace and
   mercy." When a soul sees but so much in God as to conclude, "Well, who
   knoweth but that he may return, and have mercy upon me also?" it will
   support him, and give him an entrance into farther light.

   The church in the Lamentations gives a sad account of her state and
   condition in this matter; for she maketh that hard conclusion against
   herself, chap. iii 18, "My strength and my hope is perished from the
   Lord ... Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer," verse
   8. So far is she from a comfortable persuasion of a particular interest
   in mercy and acceptance, that, under her pressures and in her
   temptations, she is ready positively to determine on the other side,
   namely, that she is rejected and cast off for ever. What course, then,
   shall she take? Shall she give over waiting on God, and say, "There is
   no hope?" "No," saith she, "I will not take that way; for (verse 26) It
   is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation
   of God.' But yet there seems small encouragement for her so to do if
   things be with her as was expressed. "Things, indeed," saith she, "are
   very sad with me. My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed
   down in me,' verse 20; but yet somewhat I recall to mind, and therefore
   have I hope,' verse 21, -- It is of the Lord's mercy that we are not
   consumed, because his compassions fail not.' [verse 22.] There is mercy
   and never-failing compassion in God, so that though my own present
   condition be full of darkness, and I see no deliverance, yet I purpose
   still to abide waiting on him. Who knows what those infinite stores and
   treasures of mercy and relief that are with him may at length afford
   unto me?" And many instances of the like kind may be added.

   We may observe, by the way, how far this relief extends itself, and
   what it enables the soul unto; as, --

   1. The soul is enabled thereby to resign itself unto the disposal of
   sovereign grace in self-abhorrency, and a renunciation of all other
   ways of relief: Lam. iii. 29, "He putteth his mouth in the dust, if so
   be there may be hope." "What God will," is his language. Here he lies
   at his disposal, humble, broken, but abiding his pleasure. "Though he
   slay me," saith Job, "yet will I trust in him," chap. xiii. 15; -- "It
   is all one how he deals with me; whatever be the event, I will abide
   cleaving unto him. I will not think of any other way of extricating
   myself from my distress. I will neither fly like Jonah, nor hide like
   Adam, nor take any other course for deliverance." Saith the soul," God
   is a God that hideth himself' from me, Isa. xlv. 15; I walk in darkness
   and have no light,' chap. l. 10. My flesh faileth and my heart
   falleth,' Ps. lxxiii. 26; so that I am overwhelmed with trouble. Mine
   iniquities have taken such hold on me that I cannot look up,' Ps. xl.
   12. The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.' [Isa.
   xlix. 14.] Every day am I in dread and terror, and I am ready utterly
   to faint, and no relief can I obtain. What, then, shall I do? Shall I
   curse God and die?' or cry, This evil is of the Lord; why should I wait
   for him any longer?' Shall I take the course of the world, and, seeing
   it will be no better, be wholly regardless of my latter end? No; I
   know, whatever my lot and portion be, that there is forgiveness with
   God. This and that poor man trusted in him; they cried unto him, and
   were delivered. So did David in his greatest distress; he encouraged
   his heart in the Lord his God, 2 Sam. xv. 25, 26. It is good for me to
   cast myself into his arms. It may be he will frown; it may be he is
   wroth still: but all is one, this way I will go. As it seems good unto
   him to deal with me, so let it be." And unspeakable are the advantages
   which a soul obtains by this self-resignation, which the faith treated
   of will infallibly produce.

   2. It extends itself unto a resolution of waiting in the condition
   wherein the soul is. This the church comes unto, Lam. iii. 26, "It is
   good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of
   the Lord;" -- "I will not give over my expectation, I will not make
   haste nor limit God; but I will lie at his feet until his own appointed
   time of mercy shall come." Expectation and quietness make up waiting.
   These the soul attains unto with this supportment. It looks upwards,
   "as a servant that looks to the hands of his master," still fixed on
   God, to see what he will do, to hear what he will speak concerning him;
   missing no season, no opportunity wherein any discovery of the will of
   God may be made to him. And this he doth in quietness, without repining
   or murmuring, turning all his complaints against himself and his own
   vileness, that hath cut him short from a participation of that fulness
   of love and grace which is with God. That this effect also attends this
   faith will fully appear in the close of the psalm.

   3. It supports unto waiting in the use of all means for the attainment
   of a sense of forgiveness, and so hath its effect in the whole course
   of our obedience. "There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
   feared." To fear the Lord, is an expression comprehensive of his whole
   worship and all our duty. "This I am encouraged unto, in my depths,"
   saith the psalmist, "because there is forgiveness with thee. I will
   abide in all duties, in all the ways of thy worship, wherein thou mayst
   be found." And however it be for a while, the latter end of that soul,
   who thus abideth with God, will be peace.

   Let us, then, nextly see by what ways and means it yields this
   supportment:--

   1. It begets a liking of God in the soul, and consequently some love
   unto him. The soul apprehends God as one infinitely to be desired and
   delighted in by those who have a share in forgiveness. It cannot but
   consider him as good and gracious, however its own estate be hazardous.
   Ps lxxiii. 1, 2, "Yet God is good to Israel, to such as are of a clean
   heart. As for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh
   slipped;" -- "However the state stands with me, yet I know that God is
   good, good to Israel; and therewith shall I support myself." When once
   this ground is got upon the soul, that it considers God in Christ as
   one to be delighted in and loved, great and blessed effects will ensue
   -- (1.) Self-abhorrency and condemnation, with resignation of all to
   God, and permanency therein, do certainly attend it. (2.) Still,
   somewhat or other in God will be brought to mind to relieve it under
   faintings, some new springs of hope will be every day opened. (3.) And
   the soul will be insensibly wrought upon to delight itself in dealing
   with God. Though, in its own particular, it meets with frownings,
   chidings, and repulses, yet this still relieves him, that God is so as
   hath been declared; so that he says, "However it be, yet God is good;
   and it is good for me to wait upon him." Without this discovery the
   soul likes not God, and whatever it doth with respect unto him, it is
   because it dares do no otherwise, being overawed with his terror and
   greatness; and such obedience God may have from devils.

   2. It removes sundry overwhelming difficulties that lie in the soul's
   way before it close with this discovery of forgiveness; as, --

   (1.) It takes away all these hinderances that were formerly insisted on
   from the greatness, holiness, and severity of God, the inexorableness
   and strictness of the law, and the natural actings of conscience rising
   up against all hopes of forgiveness. All these are by this faith
   removed, and taken out of the way. Where this faith is, it discovers
   not only forgiveness, as hath been showed, but also the true nature of
   gospel forgiveness; it reveals it as flowing from the gracious heart of
   the Father, through the blood of the Son. Now, this propitiation in the
   blood of the Son removeth all these difficulties, even antecedently
   unto our special sense of an interest therein. It shows how all the
   properties of God may be exalted and the law fulfilled, and yet
   forgiveness given out to sinners. And herein lies no small advantage
   unto a soul in its approaches unto God. All those dreadful
   apprehensions of God, which were wont to beset him in the first
   thoughts of coming to him, are now taken out of the way, so that he can
   quietly apply himself unto his own particular concernments before him.

   (2.) In particular, it removes the overwhelming consideration of the
   unspeakable greatness of sin. This presseth the soul to death, when
   once the heart is possessed with it. Were not their sins so great, such
   as no heart can imagine or tongue declare, it might possibly be well
   with them, say distressed sinners. They are not so troubled that they
   are sinners, as that they are great sinners; not that these and those
   sins they are guilty of, but that they are great sins, attended with
   fearful aggravations. Otherwise they could deal well enough with them.
   Now, though this discovery free men not from the entanglement of their
   sins as theirs, yet it doth from the whole entanglement of their sins
   as great and many. This consideration may be abstracted. The soul sees
   enough in God to forgive great sins, though it doth not as yet to
   forgive his sins. That great sins shall be pardoned, this discovery
   puts out of question. Whether his sins shall be pardoned is now all the
   inquiry. Whatever any faith can do, that this faith will do, unless it
   be the making of particular application of the things believed unto
   itself. The soul, then, can no longer justly be troubled about the
   greatness of sin; the infiniteness of forgiveness that he sees in God
   will relieve him against it. All that remains is, that it is his own
   sin about which he hath to deal; whereof afterwards. These and the like
   difficulties are removed by it.

   3. It gives some life in and encouragement unto duty. And that, first,
   unto duty as duty. Eyeing God by faith, in such a fulness of grace, the
   soul cannot but be encouraged to meet him in every way of duty, and to
   lay hold upon him thereby; -- every way leading to him, as leading to
   him, must be well liked and approved of. And, secondly, to all duties.
   And herein lies no small advantage. God is oftentimes found in duties,
   but in what, or of what kind, he will be found of any one in
   particular, is uncertain. This faith puts the soul on all: so it did
   the spouse in the parallel to that in hand, Cant. iii. 2-4. Now, what
   supportment may be hence obtained is easily apprehended, -- supportment
   not from them or by them, but in them, as the means of intercourse
   between God and the soul.

   From these effects of this discovery of forgiveness in God three things
   will ensue, which are sufficient to maintain the spiritual life of the
   soul:--

   (1.) A resolution to abide with God, and to commit all unto him. This
   the word, as was observed, teaches us: "There is forgiveness with thee,
   and therefore thou shalt be feared;" -- "Because this I found, this I
   am persuaded of, therefore I will abide with him in the way of his fear
   and worship." This our Saviour calls unto, John xv. 4," Abide in me;'
   except ye do so ye can bear no fruit." So the Lord, representing his
   taking of the church unto himself under the type of the prophet's
   taking an adulteress in vision, doth it on these terms: Hos. iii. 3,
   "Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and
   thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee." Now,
   this abiding with God intimates two things:-- [1.] Oppositions,
   solicitations, and temptations unto the contrary. [2.] Forbearing to
   make any other choice, as unto that end for which we abide with God.

   [1.] It argues oppositions. To abide, to be stable and permanent, is to
   be so against oppositions Many discouragements are ready to rise up in
   the soul against it: in fears especially that it shall not hold out,
   that it shall be rejected at last, that all is naught and hypocritical
   with it, that it shall not be forgiven, that God indeed regards it not,
   and therefore it may well enough give over its hopes, which seems often
   as the giving up of the ghost; [these] will assault it. Again,
   oppositions arise from corruptions and temptations unto sin, contrary
   to the life of faith; and these often proceed to a high degree of
   prevalency, so that the guilt contracted upon them is ready to cast the
   soul quite out of all expectation of mercy. "I shall one day perish by
   these means," saith the soul, "if I am not already lost."

   But now, where faith hath made this discovery of forgiveness, the soul
   will abide with God against all these discouragements and oppositions.
   It will not leave him, it will not give over waiting for him. So David
   expresseth the matter in the instance of himself: Ps. lxxiii. 2, "But
   as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh slipped:"
   and, verse 13, "Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain." But yet,
   after all his conflicts, this at last he comes unto, verse 26, "Though
   my flesh and my heart faileth,' yet (verse 28) It is good for me to
   draw near unto God;' -- I will yet abide with God; I will not let go
   his fear nor my profession. Although I walk weakly, lamely, unevenly,
   yet I will still follow after him." As it was with the disciples, when
   many, upon a strong temptation, went back from Christ, and walked no
   more with him, "Jesus said unto them, Will ye also go away?" to which
   Peter replies, in the name of the rest of them, "Lord, to whom shall we
   go? thou hast the words of eternal life," John vi. 66-68; -- "It is
   thus and thus with me," saith the soul; "I am tossed and afflicted, and
   not comforted; little life, little strength, real guilt, many sins, and
   much disconsolation." "What then?" saith God by his word; "wilt thou
   also go away?" "No," saith the soul; "there is forgiveness with thee;
   thou hast the words of eternal life, and therefore I will abide with
   thee."

   [2.] This abiding with God argues a forbearance of any other choice.
   Whilst the soul is in this condition, having not attained any evidences
   of its own special interest in forgiveness, many lovers will be
   soliciting of it to play the harlot by taking them into its embraces.
   Both self-righteousness and sin will be very importunate in this
   matter. The former tenders itself as exceeding useful to give the soul
   some help, assistance, and supportment in its condition. "Samuel doth
   not come," saith Saul, "and the Philistines invade me; I will venture
   and offer sacrifice myself, contrary to the law." The promise doth not
   come to the soul for its particular relief; it hath no evidence as to
   an especial interest in forgiveness. Temptation invades the mind: "Try
   thyself," says it, "to take relief in somewhat of thine own providing."
   And this is to play the harlot from God. To this purpose
   self-righteousness variously disguises itself, like the wife of
   Jeroboam when she went to the prophet. Sometimes it appears as duty,
   sometimes as signs and tokens; but its end is to get somewhat of the
   faith and trust of the soul to be fixed upon it. But when the soul hath
   indeed a discovery of forgiveness, it will not give ear to these
   solicitations. "No," saith it; "I see such a beauty, such an
   excellency, such a desirableness and suitableness unto my wants and
   condition, in that forgiveness that is with God, that I am resolved to
   abide in the gospel desire and expectation of it all the days of my
   life; here my choice is fixed, and I will not alter." And this
   resolution gives glory to the grace of God. When the soul, without an
   evidence of an interest in it, yet prefers it above that which, with
   many reasonings and pretences, offers itself as a present relief unto
   it, hereby is God glorified, and Christ exalted, and the spiritual life
   of the soul secured.

   (2.) This discovery of forgiveness in God, with the effects of it
   before mentioned, will produce a resolution of waiting on God for peace
   and consolation in his own time and way. "He that believeth shall not
   make haste," Isa. xxviii. 16. Not make haste, to what? Not to the
   enjoyment of the thing believed. Haste argues precipitation and
   impatience; this the soul that hath this discovery is freed from,
   resolving to wait the time of God's appointment for peace and
   consolation. God, speaking of his accomplishment of his promises, says,
   "I the Lord will hasten it," Isa. lx. 22. Well, then, if God will
   hasten it, may not we hasten to it? "Nay," saith he, "I will hasten it,
   but in its time." All oppositions and impediments considered, it shall
   be hastened, but in its time, its due time, its appointed time. And
   this the soul is to wait for; and so it will. As when Jacob had seen
   the beauty of Rachel, and loved her, he was contented to wait seven
   years for the enjoyment of her to be his wife, and thought no time
   long, no toil too hard, that he might obtain her; so the soul having
   discovered the beauty and excellency of forgiveness as it is with God,
   as it is in his gracious heart, in his eternal purpose, in the blood of
   Christ, in the promise of the gospel, is resolved to wait quietly and
   patiently for the time wherein God will clear up unto it its own
   personal interest therein. Even one experimental embracement of it,
   even at the hour of death, doth well deserve the waiting and obedience
   of the whole course of a man's life.

   And this the psalmist manifests to have been the effect produced in his
   heart and spirit; for upon this discovery of forgiveness in God, he
   resolved both to wait upon him himself, and encourageth others so to
   do.

   (3.) This prepares the soul for the receiving of that consolation and
   deliverance out of its pressures, by an evidence of a special interest
   in forgiveness, which it waiteth for:--

   [1.] For this makes men to hearken after it. It makes the soul like the
   merchant who hath great riches, all his wealth, in a far country, which
   he is endeavouring to bring home safe unto him. If they come, he is
   well provided for; if they miscarry, he is lost and undone. This makes
   him hearken after tidings that they are safe there; and, as Solomon
   says, "Good news," in this case, "from a far country, is as cold waters
   to a thirsty soul," Prov. xxv. 25, -- full of refreshment. Though he
   cannot look upon them as his own yet absolutely, because he hath them
   not in possession, he is glad they are safe there. So is it with the
   soul. These riches that it so values are as to its apprehensions in a
   far country. So is the promise, that "he shall behold the land that is
   very far off," Isa. xxxiii. 17. He is glad to hear news that they are
   safe, to hear forgiveness preached, and the promises insisted on,
   though he cannot as yet look upon them as his own. The merchant rests
   not here, but he hearkeneth with much solicitousness after the things
   that should bring home his riches, especially if they have in them his
   all. Hence such ships are called ships of desire, Job ix. 26. Such a
   man greatly desires the speeding of them to their port. He considers
   the wind and the weather, all the occasions, and inconveniences, and
   dangers of the way; and blame him not, -- his all is at stake. The soul
   doth so in like manner: it hearkeneth after all the ways and means
   whereby this forgiveness may be particularly brought home unto it; is
   afraid of sin and of temptation, glad to find a fresh gale of the
   Spirit of grace, hoping that it may bring in his return from the land
   of promise. This prepares the heart for a spiritual sense of it when it
   is revealed.

   [2.] It so prepares the soul, by giving it a due valuation of the grace
   and mercy desired. The merchantman in the gospel was not prepared to
   enjoy the pearl himself, until it was discovered to him to be of great
   price; then he knew how to purchase it, procure it, and keep it. The
   soul having, by this acting of faith, upon the discovery of forgiveness
   insisted on, come to find that the pearl hid in the field is indeed
   precious, is both stirred up to seek after possession of it, and to
   give it its due. Saith such a soul, "How excellent, how precious is
   this forgiveness that is with God! Blessed, yea, ever blessed, are they
   who are made partakers of it! What a life of joy, rest, peace, and
   consolation do they lead! Had I but their evidence of an interest in
   it, and the spiritual consolation that ensues thereon, how would I
   despise the world and all the temptations of Satan, and rejoice in the
   Lord in every condition!" And this apprehension of grace also
   exceedingly prepares and fits the soul for a receiving of a blessed
   sense of it, so as that God may have glory thereby.

   [3.] It fits the soul, by giving a right understanding of it, of its
   nature, its causes, and effects. At the first the soul goes no farther
   but to look after impunity, or freedom from punishment, any way. "What
   shall I do to be saved?" is the utmost it aims at. "Who shall deliver
   me? how shall I escape?" And it would be contented to escape any way,
   -- by the law, or the gospel, all is one, so it may escape. But upon
   this discovery of forgiveness treated of, which is made by faith of
   adherence unto God, a man plainly sees the nature of it, and that it is
   so excellent that it is to be desired for its own sake. Indeed, when a
   soul is brought under trouble for sin, it knows not well what it would
   have. It hath an uneasiness or disquietment that it would be freed
   from, -- a dread of some evil condition that it would avoid. But now
   the soul can tell what it desires, what it aims at, as well as what it
   would be freed from. It would have an interest in eternal love; have
   the gracious kindness of the heart of God turned towards itself, -- a
   sense of the everlasting purpose of his will shed abroad in his heart;
   have an especial interest in the precious blood of the Son of God,
   whereby atonement is made for him; and that all these things be
   testified unto his conscience in a word of promise mixed with faith.
   These things he came for; this way alone he would be saved, and no
   other. It sees such a glory of wisdom, love, and grace in forgiveness,
   such an exaltation of the love of Christ in all his offices, in all his
   undertaking, especially in his death, sacrifice, and blood-shedding,
   whereby he procured or made reconciliation for us, that it exceedingly
   longs after the participation of them.

   All these things, in their several degrees, will this discovery of
   forgiveness in God, without an evidence of an especial interest
   therein, produce. And these will assuredly maintain the spiritual life
   of the soul, and keep it up unto such an obedience as shall be accepted
   of God in Christ. Darkness, sorrow, storms, they in whom it is may meet
   withal; but their eternal condition is secured in the covenant of God,
   -- their souls are bound up in the bundle of life.

   From what hath been spoken, we may make some inferences in our passage
   concerning the true notion of believing; for, --

   1. These effects ascribed to this faith of forgiveness in God, and
   always produced by it, make it evident that the most of them who
   pretend unto it, who pretend to believe that there is forgiveness with
   God, do indeed believe no such thing. Although I shall, on set purpose,
   afterward evince this, yet I cannot here utterly pass it by. I shall,
   then, only demand of them who are so forward in the profession of this
   faith that they think it almost impossible that any one should not
   believe it, what effects it hath produced in them, and whether they
   have been by it enabled to the performance of the duties before
   mentioned? I fear with many, things on the account of their pretended
   faith are quite otherwise. They love sin the more for it, and God never
   the better. Supposing that a few barren words will issue the
   controversy about their sins, they become insensibly to have slight
   thoughts of sin and of God also. This persuasion is not of him that
   calls us. Poor souls, your faith is the devil's greatest engine for
   your ruin, -- the highest contempt of God, and Christ, and forgiveness
   also, that you can be guilty of, -- a means to let you down quietly
   into hell, -- the Pharisees' Moses, trusted in, and [yet] will condemn
   you. As none is saved but by faith, so you, if it were not for your
   faith (as you call it), might possibly be saved. If a man's gold prove
   counterfeit, his jewels painted glass, his silver lead or dross, he
   will not only be found poor when he comes to be tried, and want the
   benefit of riches, but have withal a fearful aggravation of his poverty
   by his disappointment and surprisal. If a man's faith, which should be
   more precious than gold, be found rotten and corrupt, if his light be
   darkness, how vile is that faith, how great is that darkness! Such, it
   is evident, will the faith of too many be found in this business.

   2. The work we are carrying on is the raising of a sin-entangled soul
   out of its depths; and this we have spoken unto is that which must give
   him his first relief. Commonly, when souls are in distress, that which
   they look after is consolation. What is it that they intend thereby?
   That they may have assurance that their sins are forgiven them, and so
   be freed from their present perplexities. What is the issue? Some of
   them continue complaining all their days, and never come to rest or
   peace, so far do they fall short of consolation and joy; and some are
   utterly discouraged from attempting any progress in the ways of God.
   What is the reason hereof? Is it not that they would fain be finishing
   their building, when they have not laid the foundation? They have not
   yet made thorough work in believing forgiveness with God, and they
   would immediately be at assurance in themselves. Now, God delights not
   in such a frame of spirit; for, --

   (1.) It is selfish. The great design of faith is to "give glory to
   God," Rom. iv. 20. The end of God's giving out forgiveness is the
   "praise of his glorious grace," Eph. i. 6. But let a soul in this frame
   have peace in itself, it is very little solicitous about giving glory
   unto God. He cries like Rachel, "Give me children, or I die;" -- "Give
   me peace, or I perish." That God may be honoured, and the forgiveness
   he seeks after be rendered glorious, it is cared for in the second
   place, if at all. This selfish earnestness, at first to be thrusting
   our hand in the side of Christ, is that which he will pardon in many,
   but accepts in none.

   (2.) It is impatient. Men do thus deport themselves because they will
   not wait. They do not care for standing afar off for any season with
   the publican. They love not to submit their souls to lie at the foot of
   God, to give him the glow of his goodness, mercy, wisdom, and love, in
   the disposal of them and their concernments. This waiting compriseth
   the universal subjection of the soul unto God, with a resolved judgment
   that it is meet and right that we, and all we desire and aim at, should
   be at his sovereign disposal. This gives glow to God, -- a duty which
   the impatience of these poor souls will not admit them to the
   performance of. And both these arise, --

   (3.) From weakness. It is weak. It is weakness in any condition, that
   makes men restless and weary. The state of adherence is as safe a
   condition as the state of assurance; only, it hath more combats and
   wrestling attending it. It is not, then, fear of the event, but
   weakness and weariness of the combat, that makes men anxiously
   solicitous about a deliverance from that state before they are well
   entered into it.

   Let, then, the sin-entangled soul remember always this way, method, and
   order of the gospel, that we have under consideration. First, exercise
   faith on forgiveness in God; and when the soul is fixed therein, it
   will have a ground and foundation whereon it may stand securely in
   making application of it unto itself. Drive this principle, in the
   first place, unto a stable issue upon gospel evidences, answer the
   objections that lie against it, and then you may proceed. In believing,
   the soul makes a conquest upon Satan's territories. Do, then, as they
   do who are entering on an enemy's country, -- secure the passages,
   fortify the strongholds as you go on, that you be not cut off in your
   progress. Be not as a ship at sea, which passeth on, and is no more
   possessed or master of the water it hath gone through than of that
   whereunto it is not yet arrived. But so it is with a soul that fixeth
   not on these foundation principles: he presseth forwards, and the
   ground crumbles away under his feet, and so he wilders away all his
   days in uncertainties. Would men but lay this principle well in their
   souls, and secure it against assaults, they might proceed, though not
   with so much speed as some do, yet with more safety. Some pretend at
   once to fall into full assurance; I wish it prove not a broad
   presumption in the most, It is to no purpose for him to strive to fly
   who cannot yet go, -- to labour to come to assurance in himself who
   never well believed forgiveness in God.

   Thirdly. [4] Now, that we may be enabled to fix this persuasion against
   all opposition, that which in the next place I shall do is, to give out
   such unquestionable evidences of this gospel truth as the soul may
   safely build and rest upon; and these contain the confirmation of the
   principal proposition before laid down.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Evidences of forgiveness in God -- No inbred notions of any free acts
   of God's will -- Forgiveness not revealed by the works of nature nor
   the law.

   First, The things that are spoken or to be known of God are of two
   sorts:--

   1. Natural and necessary; such as are his essential properties, or the
   attributes of his nature, his goodness, holiness, righteousness,
   omnipotency, eternity, and the like. These are called, To gnoston tou
   Theou, Rom. i 19, -- "That which may be known of God." And there are
   two ways, as the apostle there declares, whereby that which he there
   intimates of God may be known, -- (1.) By the inbred light of nature:
   Phaneron estin en autois, verse 19, -- "It is manifest in themselves,"
   in their own hearts; they are taught it by the common conceptions and
   presumptions which they have of God by the light of nature. From hence
   do all mankind know concerning God that he is, that he is eternal,
   infinitely powerful, good, righteous, holy, omnipotent. There needs no
   special revelation of these things, that men may know them. That,
   indeed, they may be known savingly, there is; and, therefore, they that
   know these things by nature do also believe them on revelation: Heb.
   xi. 6, "He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
   rewarder." Though men know God by the light of nature, yet they cannot
   come to God by that knowledge. (2.) These essential properties of the
   nature of God are revealed by his works. So the apostle in the same
   place, Rom. i. 20, "The invisible things of God from the creation of
   the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
   made, even his eternal power and Godhead." See also Ps. xix. 1-3. And
   this is the first sort of things that may be known of God.

   2. There are the free acts of his will and power, or his free, eternal
   purposes, with the temporal dispensations that flow from them. Now, of
   this sort is the forgiveness that we are inquiring after. It is not a
   property of the nature of God, but an act of his will and a work of his
   grace. Although it hath its rise and spring in the infinite goodness of
   his nature, yet it proceeds from him, and is not exercised but by an
   absolute, free, and sovereign act of his will. Now, there is nothing of
   God or with him of this sort that can be any ways known but only by
   especial revelation; for, --

   (1.) There is no inbred notion of the acts of God's will in the heart
   of man; which is the first way whereby we come to the knowledge of any
   thing of God. Forgiveness is not revealed by the light of nature. Flesh
   and blood, which nature is, declares it not; by that means "no man hath
   seen God at any time," John i. 18, -- that is, as a God of mercy and
   pardon, as the Son reveals him. Adam had an intimate acquaintance,
   according to the limited capacity of a creature, with the properties
   and excellencies of the nature of God. It was implanted in his heart,
   as indispensably necessary unto that natural worship which, by the law
   of his creation, he was to perform. But when he had sinned, it is
   evident that he had not the least apprehension that there was
   forgiveness with God. Such a thought would have laid a foundation of
   some farther treaty with God about his condition. But he had no other
   design but of flying and hiding himself, Gen. iii. 10; so declaring
   that he was utterly ignorant of any such thing as pardoning mercy.
   Such, and no other, are all the first or purely natural conceptions of
   sinners, -- namely, that it is dikaioma tou Theou, "the judgment of
   God," Rom. i. 32, that sin is to be punished with death. It is true,
   these conceptions in many are stifled by rumours, reports, traditions,
   that it may be otherwise; But all these are far enough from that
   revelation of forgiveness which we are inquiring after.

   (2.) The consideration of the works of God's creation will not help a
   man to this knowledge, that there is forgiveness with God. The apostle
   tells us, Rom. i. 20, what it is of God that his works reveal, "even
   his eternal power and Godhead," or the essential properties of his
   nature, but no more; not any of the purposes of his grace, not any of
   the free acts of his will, not pardon and forgiveness. Besides, God
   made all things in such an estate and condition, -- namely, of
   rectitude, integrity, and uprightness, Eccles. vii. 29, -- that it was
   impossible they should have any respect unto sin, which is the
   corruption of all, or to the pardon of it, which is their restitution,
   whereof they stood in no need. There being no such thing in the world
   as a sin, nor any such thing supposed to be, when all things were made
   of nothing, how could any thing declare or reveal the forgiveness of
   it?

   (3.) No works of God's providence can make this discovery. God hath,
   indeed, borne testimony to himself and his goodness in all ages, from
   the foundation of the world, in the works of his providence: so Acts
   xiv. 15-17, "We preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities
   unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all
   things that are therein: who in times past suffered all nations to walk
   in their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in
   that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons,
   filling our hearts with food and gladness." Ouk amarturon heauton
   apheke -- "He left not himself without witness;" that is, by the works
   of his providence, there recounted, he thus far bare testimony to
   himself, that he is, and is good, and doth good, and ruleth the world;
   so that they were utterly inexcusable, who, taking no notice of these
   works of his, nor the fruits of his goodness, which they lived upon,
   turned away after ta mataia, "vain things," as the apostle there calls
   the idols of the Gentiles. But yet these things did not discover pardon
   and forgiveness; for still God suffered them to go on in their own
   ways, and winked at their ignorance. So again, Acts xvii. 23-27, "Whom
   ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. God that made the world
   and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth,
   dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is worshipped with
   men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all
   life, and breath, and all things; and hath made of one blood all
   nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth" (where, by
   the way, there is an allusion to that of Gen. xi. 8, "The Lord
   scattered them abroad upon the face of all the earth"), "and hath
   determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their
   habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel
   after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us." By
   arguments taken from the works of God, both of creation and providence,
   the apostle proves the being and the properties of God; yea, he lets
   them know with whom he had to do, that God designed by his works so far
   to reveal himself unto them as the true and living God, the maker and
   governor of all things, as that they ought to have inquired more
   diligently after him, and not to look on him alone as the "unknown God"
   who alone might be known, all their idols being vain and nothing. But
   of the discovery of pardon and forgiveness in God by these ways and
   means he speaks not; yea, he plainly shows that this was not done
   thereby: for the great call to saving repentance is by the revelation
   of forgiveness. But now, by these works of his providence, God called
   not the Gentiles to saving repentance. No; saith he, "He suffered them
   to walk still in their own ways," Acts xiv. 16, "and winked at the
   times of their ignorance; but now," -- that is, by the word of the
   gospel, -- "commandeth them to repent," chap. xvii. 30.

   Secondly, Whereas there had been one signal act of God's providence
   about sin, when man first fell into the snares of it, it was so far
   from the revealing forgiveness in God, that it rather severely
   intimated the contrary. This was God's dealing with sinning angels. The
   angels were the first sinners, and God dealt first with them about sin.
   And what was his dealing with them the Holy Ghost tell us, 2 Pet. ii.
   4, Angelon hamartesanton ouk epheisatoÂ· -- "He spared not the sinning
   angels." "He spared them not;" it is the same word which he useth where
   he speaks of laying all our iniquities on Christ, he undergoing the
   punishment due unto them: Rom. viii. 32, Ouk epheisato, -- "He spared
   him not;" that is, he laid on him the full punishment that by the curse
   and sanction of the law was due unto sin. So he dealt with the angels
   that sinned: "He spared them not," but inflicted on them the punishment
   due unto sin, shutting them up under chains of darkness for the
   judgment of the great day. Hitherto, then, God keeps all thoughts of
   forgiveness in his own eternal bosom; there is not so much as the least
   dawning of it upon the world. And this was at first no small prejudice
   against any thoughts of forgiveness. The world is made; sin enters by
   the most glorious part of the creation, whose recovery by pardon might
   seem to be more desirable, but not the least appearance of it is
   discovered. Thus it was "from the beginning of the world hid in God,"
   Eph. iii. 9.

   Thirdly, God gave unto man a law of obedience immediately upon his
   creation; yea, for the main of it, he implanted it in him by and in his
   creation. This law it was supposed that man might transgress. The very
   nature of a law prescribed unto free agents, attended with threatenings
   and promises of reward, requires that supposition. Blow, there was not
   annexed unto this law, or revealed with it, the least intimation of
   pardon to be obtained if transgression should ensue. Gen. ii. 17, we
   have this law, "In the day thou eatest thou shalt surely die;" --
   "Dying thou shalt die;" or "bring upon thyself assuredly the guilt of
   death temporal and eternal." There God leaves the sinner, under the
   power of that commination. Of forgiveness or pardoning mercy there is
   not the least intimation. To this very day that law, which was then the
   whole rule of life and acceptance with God, knows no such thing. "Dying
   thou shalt die, O sinner," is the precise and final voice of it.

   From these previous considerations, added to what was formerly spoken,
   some things preparatory to the ensuing discourse may be inferred; as,
   --

   1. That it is a great and rare thing to have forgiveness in God
   discovered unto a sinful soul. A thing it is that, as hath been showed,
   conscience and law, with the inbred notions that are in the heart of
   man about God's holiness and vindictive justice, do lie against; a
   matter whereof we have no natural presumption, whereof there is no
   common notion in the mind of man; a thing which no consideration of the
   works of God, either of creation or providence, will reveal, and which
   the great instance of God's dealing with sinning angels renders deep,
   admirable, and mysterious. Men who have common and slight thoughts of
   God, of themselves, of sin, of obedience, of the judgment to come, of
   eternity, -- that feed upon the ashes of rumours, reports, hearsays,
   traditions, without looking into the reality of things, -- may and do
   take this to be an ordinary and acknowledged truth, easy to be
   entertained, which upon the matter no man disbelieves. But convinced
   sinners, who make a trial of these things as running into eternity,
   have other thoughts of them. And as to that which, it is pretended,
   every one believes, we have great cause to cry out, "Lord, who hath
   believed our report? to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed,"

   2. That the discovery of forgiveness in God, being a matter of so great
   difficulty, is a thing precious and excellent, as being the foundation
   of all our communion with God here, and of all undeceiving expectation
   of our enjoyment of him hereafter. It is a pure gospel truth, that hath
   neither shadow, footstep, nor intimation elsewhere. The whole creation
   hath not the least obscure impression of it left thereon. So that, --

   3. It is undoubtedly greatly incumbent on us to inquire diligently, as
   the prophets did of old, into this salvation; to consider what sure
   evidences faith hath of it, such as will not, as cannot fail us. To be
   slight and common in this matter, to take it up at random, is an
   argument of an unsound, rotten heart. He that is not serious in his
   inquiry into the revelation of this matter, is serious in nothing
   wherein God or his soul is concerned. The Holy Ghost knows what our
   frame of heart is, and how slow we are to receive this blessed truth in
   a gracious, saving manner. Therefore doth he confirm it unto us with
   such weighty considerations as, Heb. vi. 17, 18, "God, willing more
   abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his
   counsel, confirmed it by an oath: that by two immutable things, in
   which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong
   consolation." It is of forgiveness of sin that the apostle treats; as
   hath been made evident by the description of it before given. Now, to
   give evidence hereunto, and to beget a belief of it in us, he first
   engages a property of God's nature in that business. He with whom we
   deal is apseudesÂ· as Tit. i. 2, the God that cannot lie, that cannot
   deceive or be deceived: it is impossible it should be so with him. Now,
   as this extends itself in general to all the words and works of God, so
   there is peculiarly in this, whereof he treats, to ametatheton tes
   boules, -- an especial "immutability of his counsel." [Heb. vi. 17.]
   Men may think that although there be words spoken about forgiveness,
   yet it is possible it may be otherwise." "No," saith the apostle; "it
   is spoken by God, and it is impossible he should lie." Yea, but upon
   the manifold provocations of sinners, he may change his mind and
   thoughts therein. "No," saith the apostle; "there is a peculiar
   immutability in his counsel concerning the execution of this thing:
   there can be no change in it." But how doth this appear, that indeed
   this is the counsel of his will? "Why," saith he, "he hath declared it
   by his word, and that given in a way of promise: which, as in its own
   nature it is suited to raise an expectation in him or them to whom it
   is made or given, so it requires exact faithfulness in the discharge
   and performance of it which God on his part will assuredly answer. But
   neither is this all; but that no place might be left for any cavilling
   objection in this matter, emesiteusen horko. he interposed himself by
   an oath.'?" Thus we have this truth deduced from the veracity of God's
   nature, one of his essential excellencies; established in the immutable
   purpose of his will; brought forth by a word of promise; and confirmed
   by God's interposing himself against all occasions of exception (so to
   put an end unto all strife about it) by an oath, swearing by himself
   that so it should be. I have mentioned this only to show what weight
   the Holy Ghost lays upon the delivery of this great truth, and thence
   how deeply it concerns us to inquire diligently into it and after the
   grounds and evidences which may be tendered of it; which, among others,
   are these that follow:--
     __________________________________________________________________

   Discovery of forgiveness in the first promise -- The evidence of the
   truth that lies therein -- And by the institution of sacrifices --
   Their use and end -- Also by the prescription of repentance unto
   sinners.

   I. The first discovery of forgiveness in God (and which I place as the
   first evidence of it) was made in his dealing with our first parents
   after their shameful sin and fall. Now, to make it appear that this is
   an evidence that carries along with it a great conviction, and is such
   as faith may securely rest upon and close withal, the ensuing
   observations are to be considered:--

   1. The first sin in the world was, on many accounts, the greatest sin
   that ever was in the world. It was the sin, as it were, of human
   nature, wherein there was a conspiracy of all individuals: "Omnes
   eramus unus ille homo;" -- "In that one man, or that one sin, we all
   sinned,' Rom. v. 12. It left not God one subject, as to moral
   obedience, on the earth, nor the least ground for any such to be unto
   eternity. When the angels sinned, the whole race or kind did not
   prevaricate. "Thousand thousands" of them, and "ten thousand times ten
   thousand," continued in their obedience, Dan. vii. 10. But here all and
   every individual of mankind (He only excepted which was not then in
   Adam) were embarked in the same crime and guilt. Besides, it disturbed
   the government of God in and over the whole creation. God had made all
   things, in number, weight, and measure, in order and beauty;
   pronouncing himself concerning his whole work that it was tvv m'd?,
   "exceeding beautiful and good," Gen. i. 31. Much of this beauty lay in
   the subordination of one thing to another, and of all to himself by the
   mediation and interposition of man, through whose praises and obedience
   the rest of the creation, being made subject unto him, was to return
   their tribute of honour and glory unto God. But all this order was
   destroyed by this sin, and the very "creation made subject to vanity,"
   Rom. viii. 20; on which and the like accounts, it might be easily made
   to appear that it was the greatest sin that ever was in the world.

   2. Man, who had sinned, subscribed in his heart and conscience unto the
   righteous sentence of the law. He knew what he had deserved, and looked
   for nothing but the immediate execution of the sentence of death upon
   him. Hence he meditates not a defence, expects no pardon, stays not for
   a trial, but flies and hides, and attempts an escape: Gen. iii. 10, "I
   was afraid," saith he, "and hid myself;" than which never were there
   words of greater horror in the world, nor shall be until the day of
   judgment. Poor creature! he was full of expectation of the vengeance
   due for a broken covenant.

   3. God had newly declared in the sinning angels what his justice
   required, and how he could deal with sinning man, without the least
   impeachment of his government, holiness, or goodness. See 2 Pet. ii. 4.

   4. There was nothing without God himself that should move him in the
   least, so much as to suspend the execution of his wrath for one moment.
   He had not done so with the angels. All things lay now under wrath,
   curse, confusion, and disorder; nothing was left good, lovely, or
   desirable in his eye. As in the first creation, that which was first
   brought forth from nothing was thv vvhv?, "without form, and void,"
   empty of all order and beauty, -- nothing was in it to induce or move
   God to bring forth all things in the glory that ensued, but the whole
   design of it proceeded from his own infinite goodness and wisdom, -- so
   was it now again. There was an emptiness and vanity brought by sin upon
   the whole creation. Nothing remained that might be a motive unto a
   merciful restoration, but all is again devolved on his sovereignty. All
   things being in this state and condition, wherein all doors stood open
   to the Glow of God's justice in the punishing of sin, nothing remaining
   without him to hold his hand in the least, the whole creation, and
   especially the sinner himself, lying trembling in expectation of a
   dreadful doom, what now cometh forth from him? The blessed word which
   we have, Gen. iii. 15, "The seed of the woman shall break the serpent's
   head." It is full well known that the whole mystery of forgiveness is
   wrapped up in this one word of promise. And the great way of its coming
   forth from God, by the blood of the Messiah, whose heel was to be
   bruised, is also intimated. And this was the first discovery that ever
   was made of forgiveness in God. By a word of pure revelation it was
   made, and so faith must take it up and receive it. Now, this revelation
   of forgiveness with God in this one promise was the bottom of all that
   worship that was yielded unto him by sinners for many ages; for we have
   showed before, that without this no sinner can have the least
   encouragement to approach unto him. And this will continue to the end
   of the world as a notable evidence of the truth in hand, a firm
   foundation for faith to rest and build upon. Let a sinner seriously
   consider the state of things as they were then in the world, laid down
   before, and then view God coming forth with a word of pardon and
   forgiveness, merely from his own love and those counsels of peace that
   were between the Father and the Son, and he cannot but conclude, under
   his greatest difficulties, that yet "there is forgiveness with God,
   that he may be feared." Let now the law and conscience, let sin and
   Satan, stand forth and except against his evidence. Enough may be
   spoken from it, whatever the particular case be about which the soul
   hath a contest with them, to put them all to silence.

   II. God revealed this sacred truth by his institution of sacrifices.
   Sacrifices by blood do all of them respect atonement, expiation, and
   consequently forgiveness. It is true, indeed, they could not themselves
   take away sin, nor make them perfect who came unto God by them, Heb. x.
   1; but yet they undeniably evince the taking away of sin, or the
   forgiveness of it, by what they did denote and typify. I shall,
   therefore, look back into their rise and intendment:--

   1. The original and first spring of sacrifices is not in the Scripture
   expressly mentioned, only the practice of the saints is recorded. But
   it is certain, from infallible Scripture evidences, that they were of
   God's immediate institution and appointment. God never allowed that the
   will or wisdom of man should be the spring and rule of his worship.
   That solemn word wherewith he fronts the command that is the rule of
   his worship, l' tsh lk?, -- "Thou shalt not make to thyself," which is
   the life of the command (that which follows being an explanation and
   confirmation of the law itself by instances), cuts off all such
   pretences, and is as a flaming sword, turning every way to prevent
   men's arbitrary approaches to God's institutions. God will not part
   with his glory of being the only lawgiver, as to the whole concernment
   of his worship, or any part of it, unto any of the sons of men.

   2. Neither is the time of their institution mentioned. Some of the
   Papists dispute (as there are a generation of philosophical disputers
   amongst them, by whom their tottering cause is supported) that there
   should have been sacrifices in paradise, if a man had not sinned. But
   as, in all their opinions, our first inquiry ought to be, What do they
   get by this or that? their whole religion being pointed unto their
   carnal interest, so we, may in particular do it upon this uncouth
   assertion, which is perfectly contradictious to the very nature and end
   of most sacrifices, -- namely, that they should be offered where there
   is no sin. Why, they hope to establish hence a general rule, that there
   can be no true worship of God, in any state or condition, without a
   sacrifice. What, then, I pray? Why, then it is evident that the
   continual sacrifice of the mass is necessary in the church, and that
   without it there is no true worship of God; and so they are quickly
   come home to their advantage and profit, -- the mass being that
   inexhaustible spring of revenue which feeds their pride and lust
   throughout the world. But there is in the church of Christ an altar
   still, and a sacrifice still, which they have rejected for the
   abominable figment of their mass, -- namely, Christ himself, as the
   apostle informs us, Heb. xiii. 10. But as the sacrifices of beasts
   could not have been before the entrance of sin, so it may be evidenced
   that they were instituted from the foundation of the world, -- that is,
   presently after the entrance of sin. Christ is called "The Lamb of
   God," John i. 29, which he was in reference unto the sacrifices of old,
   as 1 Pet. i. 18, 19; whence he is represented in the church as a "Lamb
   slain," Rev. v. 6, or giving out the efficacy of all sacrifices to his
   church. Now, he is said to be a "Lamb slain from the foundation of the
   world," Rev. xiii. 8, which could not be unless some sacrifice,
   prefiguring his being slain, had been then offered; for it denotes not
   only the efficacy of his mediation, but the way. Besides, the apostle
   tells us that "without shedding of blood there was no remission," Heb.
   ix. 22, -- that is, God, to demonstrate that all pardon and forgiveness
   related to the blood of Christ from the foundation of the world, gave
   out no word of pardon but by and with blood. Now, I have showed before
   that he revealed pardon in the first promise; and therefore there
   ensued thereon the shedding of blood and sacrifices; and thereby that
   testament or covenant "was dedicated with blood" also, verse 18. Some
   think that the beasts, of whose skins God made garments for Adam, were
   offered in sacrifices. Nor is the conjecture vain; yea, it seems not to
   want a shadow of a gospel mystery, that their nakedness, which became
   their shame upon their sin (whence the pollution and shame of sin is
   frequently so termed), should be covered with the skins of their
   sacrifices: for in the true sacrifice there is somewhat answerable
   thereunto; and the righteousness of Him whose sacrifice takes away the
   guilt of our sin is called our clothing, that hides our pollution and
   shame.

   3. That after the giving of the law, the greatest, most noble, and
   solemn part of the worship of God consisted in sacrifices. And this
   kind of worship continued, with the approbation of God, in the world
   about four thousand years; that is, from the entrance of sin until the
   death of the Messiah, the true sacrifice, which put an end unto all
   that was typical

   These things being premised, we may consider what was the mind I and
   aim of God in the institution of this worship. One instance, and that
   of the most solemn of the whole kind, will resolve us in this inquiry.
   Lev. xvi. 5, "Two kids of the goats" are taken for "an offering for
   sin." Consider only (that we do not enlarge on particulars) how one of
   them was dealt withal: Verses 20-22, "He shall bring the live goat: and
   Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and
   confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all
   their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of
   the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the
   wilderness: and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto
   a land not inhabited."

   Let us see to what end is all this solemnity, and what is declared
   thereby. Wherefore should God appoint poor sinful men to come together,
   to take a goat or a lamb, and to confess over his head all their sins
   and transgressions, and to devote him to destruction under that
   confession? Had men invented this themselves, it had been a matter of
   no moment; but it was an institution of God, which he bound his church
   to the observation of upon the penalty of his highest displeasure.
   Certainly this was a solemn declaration that there is forgiveness with
   him. Would that God who is infinitely good, and so will not, who is
   infinitely true, holy, and faithful, and so cannot deceive, call men
   out, whom he loved, to a solemn representation of a thing wherein their
   chiefest, their eternal concernment doth lie, and suffer them to feed
   upon ashes? Let men take heed that they mock not God; for of a truth
   God mocketh not man until he be finally rejected by him. For four
   thousand years together, then, did God declare by sacrifices that there
   is forgiveness with him, and led his people by them to make a public
   representation of it in the face of the world. This is a second
   uncontrollable evidence of the truth asserted, which may possibly be of
   use to souls that come indeed deeply and seriously to deal with God;
   for though the practice be ceased, yet the instruction intended in them
   continues.

   III. God's appointment of repentance unto sinners doth reveal that
   there is forgiveness in himself. I say, the prescription of repentance
   is a revelation of forgiveness. After the angels had sinned, God never
   once called them to repentance. He would not deceive them, but let them
   know what they were to look for at his hands; he hath no forgiveness
   for them, and therefore would require no repentance of them. It is not,
   nor ever was, a duty incumbent on them to repent. Nor is it so unto the
   damned in hell. God requires it not of them, nor is it their duty.
   There being no forgiveness for them, what should move them to repent?
   Why should it be their duty so to do? Their eternal anguish about sin
   committed hath nothing of repentance in it. Assignation then, of
   repentance is a revelation of forgiveness. God would not call upon a
   sinful creature to humble itself and bewail its sin if there were no
   way of recovery or relief; and the only way of recovery from the guilt
   of sin is pardon. So Job xxxiii. 27, 28, "He looketh upon men, and if
   any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it
   profited me not; he will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and
   his life shall see the light." In the foregoing verses he declares the
   various ways that God used to bring men unto repentance. He did it by
   dreams, verses 15, 16; by afflictions, verse 19; by the preaching of
   the word, verse 23. What, then, doth God aim at in and by all these
   various ways of teaching? It is to cause man to say, "I have sinned,
   and perverted that which was right." It is to bring him to repentance.
   What now if he obtain his end, and cometh to that which is aimed at?
   Why, then, there is forgiveness for him, as is declared, verse 28.

   To improve this evidence, I shall confirm, by some few obvious
   considerations, these two things:-- 1. That the prescription of
   repentance doth indeed evince that there is forgiveness with God. 2.
   That every one in whom there is repentance wrought towards God, may
   certainly conclude that there is forgiveness with God for him.

   1. No repentance is acceptable with God but what is built or leans on
   the faith of forgiveness. We have a cloud of witnesses unto this truth
   in the Scripture. Many there have been, many are recorded who have been
   convinced of sin, perplexed about it, sorry for it, that have made open
   confession and acknowledgment of it, that, under the pressing sense of
   it, have cried out even to God for deliverance, and yet have come short
   of mercy, pardon, and acceptance with God. The cases of Cain, Pharaoh,
   Saul, Ahab, Judas, and others, might be insisted on. What was wanting,
   that made all that they did abominable? Consider one instance for all.
   It is said of Judas that he repented: Matt. xxvii. 3, Metameletheis,
   "He repented himself." But wherein did this repentance consist? (1.) He
   was convinced of his sin in general: Hemarton, saith he, -- "I have
   sinned," verse 4. (2.) He was sensible of the particular sin whereof he
   stood charged in conscience before God. "I have," saith he, "betrayed
   innocent blood;" -- "I am guilty of blood, innocent blood, and that in
   the vilest manner, by treachery." So that he comes, -- (3.) To a full
   and open confession of his sin. (4.) He makes restitution of what he
   was advantaged by his sin, "He brought again the thirty pieces of
   silver," verse 3; -- all testifying a hearty sorrow that spirited the
   whole. Methinks now Judas' repentance looks like the young man's
   obedience, who cried out, "All these things have I done; is there any
   thing yet lacking?" Yea, one thing was wanting to that young man, -- he
   had no true faith nor love to God all this while; which vitiated and
   spoiled all the rest of his performances. One thing also is wanting to
   this repentance of Judas, -- he had no faith of forgiveness in God;
   that he could not believe; and, therefore, after all this sorrow,
   instead of coming to him, he bids him the utmost defiance, and goes
   away and hangs himself.

   Indeed, faith of forgiveness, as hath been showed, hath many degrees.
   There is of them that which is indispensably necessary to render
   repentance acceptable. What it is in particular I do not dispute. It is
   not an assurance of the acceptance of our persons in general. It is not
   that the particular sin wherewith, it may he, the soul is perplexed, is
   forgiven. A general, so it be a gospel discovery that there is
   forgiveness in God, will suffice. The church expresseth it, Hos. xiv.
   3, "In thee the fatherless findeth mercy;" and Joel ii. 14, "Who
   knoweth but he will return and repent?" "I have this ground," saith the
   soul, "God is in himself gracious and merciful; the fatherless, the
   destitute and helpless, that come to him by Christ, find mercy in him.
   None in heaven and earth can evince but that he may return to me also."
   Now, let a man's convictions be never so great, sharp, wounding; his
   sorrow never so abundant, overflowing, abiding; his confession never so
   full, free, or open, -- if this one thing be wanting, all is nothing
   but what tends to death.

   2. To prescribe repentance as a duty unto sinners, without a foundation
   of pardon and forgiveness in himself, is inconsistent with the wisdom,
   holiness, goodness, faithfulness, and all other glorious excellencies
   and perfections of the nature of God; for, --

   (1.) The apostle lays this as the great foundation of all consolation,
   that God cannot lie or deceive, Heb. vi. 18. And again, he engageth the
   faithfulness and veracity of God to the same purpose: Tit. i. 2, "God,
   who cannot lie, hath promised it." Now, there is a lie, a deceit, in
   things as well as in words, He that doth a thing which in its own
   nature is apt to deceive them that consider it, with an intention of
   deceiving them, is no less a liar than he which affirms that to be true
   which he knows to be false. There is a lie in actions as well as in
   words. The whole life of a hypocrite is a lie; so saith the prophet of
   idolaters, there is "a lie in their right hand," Isa. xliv. 20.

   (2.) The proposal of repentance is a thing fitted and suited in its own
   nature to beget thoughts in the mind of a sinner that there is
   forgiveness with God. Repenting is for sinners only. "I come not,"
   saith our Saviour, "to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
   It is for them, and them only. It was no duty for Adam in Eden, it is
   none for the angels in heaven, nor for the damned in hell. What, then,
   may be the language of this appointment? "O sinners, come and deal with
   God by repentance." Doth it not openly speak forgiveness in God? and,
   if it were otherwise, could men possibly be more frustrated or
   deceived? would not the institution of repentance be a lie? Such a
   delusion may proceed from Satan, but not from Him who is the fountain
   of goodness, holiness, and truth. His call to repentance is a full
   demonstration of his readiness to forgive, Acts xvii. 30, 31. It is
   true, many do thus deceive themselves: they raise themselves unto an
   expectation of immunity, not on gospel grounds; and their
   disappointment is a great part of their punishment. But God deceives
   none; whoever comes to him on his proposal of repentance shall find
   forgiveness. It is said of some, indeed, that "he will laugh at their
   calamity, and mock when their fear cometh," Prov. i. 26. He will
   aggravate their misery, by giving them to see what their pride and
   folly hath brought them unto. But who are they? Only such as refuse his
   call to repentance, with the promises of the acceptation annexed.

   (3.) There is, then, no cause why those who are under a call to
   repentance should question whether there be forgiveness in God or no.
   This concerns my second proposition. "Come," saith the Lord unto the
   souls of men, "leave your sinful ways, turn unto me; humble yourselves
   with broken and contrite heart." "Alas!" say poor convinced sinners,
   "we are poor, dark, and ignorant creatures; or we are old in sin, or
   greater sinners or backsliders, or have fallen often into the same
   sins; -- can we expect there should be forgiveness for us?" Why, you
   are under God's invitation to repentance; and to disbelieve forgiveness
   is to call the truth, holiness, and faithfulness of God into question.
   If you will not believe forgiveness, pretend what you please, it is in
   truth because you hate repentance. You do but deceive your souls, when
   you pretend you come not up to repentance because you cannot believe
   forgiveness; for in the very institution of this duty God engageth all
   his properties to make it good that he hath pardon and mercy for
   sinners.

   (4.) Much less cause is there to doubt of forgiveness where sincere
   repentance is in any measure wrought. No soul comes to repentance but
   upon God's call; God calls none but whom he hath mercy for upon their
   coming. And as for those who sin against the Holy Ghost, as they shut
   themselves out from forgiveness, so they are not called to repentance.

   (5.) God expressly declares in the Scripture that the forgiveness that
   is with him is the foundation of his prescribing repentance unto man.
   One instance may suffice: Isa. lv. 7, "Let the wicked forsake his way"
   (rs?, "a perverse wicked one," v'ys 'vn?, "and the man of iniquity his
   thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy; and
   to our God, for yrvh lslvch?, he will multiply to pardon." You see to
   whom he speaks, -- to men perversely wicked, and such as make a trade
   of sinning. What doth he call them unto? Plainly, to repentance, to the
   duty we have insisted on. But what is the ground of such an invitation
   unto such profligate sinners? Why, the abundant forgiveness and pardon
   that is with him, superabounding unto what the worst of them can stand
   in need of; as Rom. v. 20.

   And this is another way whereby God hath revealed that there is
   forgiveness with him; and an infallible bottom for faith to build upon
   in its approaches unto God it is. Nor can the certainty of this
   evidence be called into question but on such grounds as are derogatory
   to the glory and honour of God. And this connection of repentance and
   forgiveness is that principle from whence God convinces a stubborn,
   unbelieving people that all his ways and dealings with sinners are just
   and equal, Ezek. xviii. 25. And should there be any failure in it, they
   could not be so. Every soul, then, that is under a call to repentance,
   whether out of his natural condition or from any backsliding into folly
   after conversion, hath a sufficient foundation to rest on as to the
   pardon he inquires after. God is ready to deal with him on terms of
   mercy. If, out of love to sin or the power of unbelief, he refuse to
   close with him on these terms, his condemnation is just. And it will be
   well that this consideration be well imprinted on the minds of men. I
   say, notwithstanding the general presumptions that men seem to have of
   this matter, yet these principles of it ought to be inculcated; for, --

   [1.] Such is the atheism that lies lurking in the hearts of men by
   nature, that, notwithstanding their pretences and professions, we have
   need to be pressing upon them evidences of the very being and essential
   properties of God. In so doing, we have the assistance of inbred
   notions in their own minds, which they cannot eject, to help to carry
   on the work. How much more is this necessary in reference unto the free
   acts of the will of God, which are to be known only by mere revelation!
   Our word had need to be "line upon line;" and yet, when we have done,
   we have cause enough to cry out, as was said, "Lord, who hath believed
   our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?"

   [2.] What was spoken before of the obstacles that lie in the way,
   hindering souls from a saving reception of this truth, ought to be
   remembered. Those who have no experience of them between God and their
   souls seem to be ignorant of the true nature of conscience, law,
   gospel, grace, sin, and forgiveness.

   [3.] Many who are come to a saving persuasion of it, yet having not
   received it upon clear and unquestionable grounds, and so not knowing
   how to resolve their faith of it into its proper principles, are not
   able to answer the objections that lie against it in their own
   consciences, and so do miserably fluctuate about it all their days.
   These had need to have these principles inculcated on them. Were they
   pondered aright, some might have cause to say, with the Samaritans, who
   first gave credit to the report of the woman, John iv. they had but a
   report before, but now they find all things to be according unto it,
   yea, to exceed it. A little experience of a man's own unbelief, with
   the observation that may easily be made of the uncertain progresses and
   fluctuations of the spirits of others, will be a sufficient conviction
   of the necessity of the work we are engaged in.

   But it will yet be said, that it is needless to multiply arguments and
   evidences in this case, the truth insisted on being granted as one of
   the' fundamental principles of religion. As it is not, then, by any
   called in question, so it doth not appear that so much time and pains
   is needful for the confirmation of it; for what is granted and plain
   needs little confirmation. But several things may be returned in answer
   hereunto; all which may at once be here pleaded for the multiplication
   of our arguments in this matter:--

   1. That it is generally granted by all is no argument that it is
   effectually believed by many. Sundry things are taken for granted in
   point of opinion that are not so believed as to be improved in
   practice. We have in part showed before, and shall afterward undeniably
   evince, that there are very few that believe this truth with that faith
   that will interest them in it and give them the benefit of it. And what
   will it avail any of us that there is forgiveness of sin with God, if
   our sins be not forgiven? No more than that such or such a king is
   rich, whilst we are poor and starving. My aim is not to prove it as an
   opinion or a mere speculative truth, but so to evidence it in the
   principles of its being and revelation as that it may be believed;
   whereon all our blessedness depends.

   2. It needs never the less confirmation because it is a plain
   fundamental truth, but rather the more; and that because both of the
   worth and weight of it. "This is a faithful saying," saith the apostle,
   "worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to
   save sinners." So I say of this, which, for the substance of it, is the
   same with that. It is worthy of all acceptation, namely, that there is
   forgiveness with God; and therefore ought it to be fully confirmed,
   especially whilst we make use of no other demonstrations of it but
   those only which God hath furnished us withal to that purpose: and this
   he would not have done, but that he knew them needful for us. And for
   the plainness of this truth, it is well if it be so unto us. This I
   know, nothing but the Spirit of God can make it so. Men may please
   themselves and others sometimes with curious notions, and make them
   seem to be things of great search and attainment, which, when they are
   well examined, it may be they are not true; or if they are, are yet of
   a very little consequence or importance. It is these fundamental truths
   that have the mysteries of the wisdom and grace of God inwrapped in
   them; which whoso can unfold aright, will show himself "a workman that
   needs not be ashamed." These still waters are deep; and the farther we
   dive into them, the greater discovery shall we make of their depths.
   And many other sacred truths there are whose mention is common, but
   whose depths are little searched and whose efficacy is little known.

   3. We multiply these evidences, because they are multitudes that are
   concerned in them. All that do believe, and all that do not believe,
   are so, -- those that do believe, that they may be established; and
   those that do not believe, that they may be encouraged so to do. Among
   both these sorts, some evidences may he more profitable and useful, one
   to one, some to another. It may be, amongst all, all will be gathered
   up, that no fragments be lost. They are all, I hope, instruments
   provided by the Holy Ghost for this end; and by this ordinance do we
   endeavour to put them into his hand, to be made effectual as he Will.
   One may reach one soul, another another, according to his pleasure. One
   may be of use to establishment, another to consolation, a third to
   encouragement, according as the necessities of poor souls do require.
   However, God, who hath provided them, knows them all to he needful

   4. They are so, also, upon the account of the various conditions
   wherein the spirits of believers themselves may be. One may give help
   to the same soul at one season, another at another; one may secure the
   soul against a temptation, another stir it up to thankfulness and
   obedience,

   These things have I spoken, that you may not think we dwell too long on
   this consideration. And I pray God that your consolation and
   establishment may abound in the reading of these meditations, as I hope
   they have not been altogether without their fruit in their preparation.

   Farther evidences of forgiveness with God -- Testimonies that God was
   well pleased with some that were sinners -- The patience of God towards
   the world an evidence of forgiveness -- Experience of the saints of God
   to the same purpose.

   IV. Let us, then, in the fourth place, as a fourth evidence of this
   truth, consider those, both under the Old Testament and the New,
   concerning whom we have the greatest assurance that God was well
   pleased with them, and that they are now in the enjoyment of him. And
   this argument unto this purpose the apostle insists upon, and presseth
   from sundry instances, Heb. xi. How many doth he there reckon up who of
   old "obtained a good report," and "this testimony, that they pleased
   God!" verses 2, 5. "All these inherited the promises" through
   believing, -- that is, obtained the "forgiveness of sins" for whereas
   "by nature they were children of wrath," and "under the curse" as well
   as others, obtaining an infallible interest in the favour of God, and
   this testimony, "that they pleased him," it could no otherwise be; for
   without this, on a just account, every one of them would have continued
   in the state wherein Adam was when he "heard the voice of God, and was
   afraid." Wherefore, it being evident that some persons, in all
   generations, have enjoyed the friendship, love, and favour of God in
   this world, and at their departure out of it have entered into glory,
   it makes it evident that there is forgiveness of sin with him; without
   which these things could not be.

   Let us, after the example of the apostle, mention some particular
   instances in this matter. Look unto Abraham: he was the "friend of
   God," and walked with God. God made a solemn covenant with him, and
   takes it for his memorial throughout all generations that he is the
   "God of Abraham." And he is doubtless now at rest with God. Our Saviour
   calls the place or condition whereinto blessed souls are gathered,
   "Abraham's bosom." He is at rest with whom others are at rest.

   The condition was the same with Isaac and Jacob. They also are in
   heaven, being alive unto and with God. Our Saviour proves it from the
   tenor of the covenant: "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
   and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the
   living," Matt. xxii. 32. They are yet alive, alive unto God, and with
   him by virtue of the covenant; or, after their death, God would not be
   said to be their God. This is the force of our Saviour's argument in
   that place, that after their death God was still their God. Then death
   had not reached their whole persons. They were still alive with God in
   heaven; and their bodies, by virtue of the same covenant, were to be
   recovered out of the dusk

   The same is the state with David. He was a "man after God's own heart,"
   that did his will and fulfilled all his pleasure. And although he died,
   and his body saw corruption, yet he is not lost; he is with God in
   heaven. Hence he ended his days triumphantly, in a full apprehension of
   eternal rest, beyond what could in this world be attained, and that by
   virtue of the covenant; for these are the last words of David,
   "Although my house be not so with God, yet he hath made with me an
   everlasting covenant," ascertaining unto him sure and eternal mercies,
   2 Sam. xxiii. 5.

   Peter also is in heaven. Christ prayed for him that his faith should
   not fail; and in his death he glorified God, John xxi. 19. So is Paul;
   he also is in heaven. He knew that when he was dissolved he should be
   with Christ.

   Here, then, "we are compassed about with a cloud of witnesses;" for, --

   1. It is most certain that they were all sinners. They were all so by
   nature; for therein there is no difference between any of the children
   of men. And personally they were sinners also. They confessed so of
   themselves, and some of the sins of all of them stand upon record. Yea,
   some of them were great sinners, or guilty of great and signal
   miscarriages; -- some before their conversion, as Abraham, who was an
   idolater, Josh. xxiv. 2, 3, and Paul, who was a persecutor and a
   blasphemer; some after their conversion; some in sins of the flesh
   against their obedience, as David; and some in sins of profession
   against faith, as Peter. Nothing, then, is more evident than that no
   one of them came to rest with God but by forgiveness. Had they never
   been guilty of any one sin, but only what is left upon record
   concerning them in holy writ, yet they could be saved no other way; for
   he that transgresseth the law in any one point is guilty of the breach
   of the whole, James ii. 10.

   What shall we now say? Do we think that God hath forgiveness only for
   this or that individual person? No man questions but that all these
   were pardoned. Was it by virtue of any especial personal privilege that
   was peculiar unto them? Whence should any such privilege arise, seeing
   by nature they were no better than others, nor would have been so
   personally had not they been delivered from sin, and prepared for
   obedience by grace, mercy, and pardon? Wherefore, they all obtained
   forgiveness by virtue of the covenant, from the forgiveness which is
   with God. And this is equally ready for others who come to God the same
   way that they did; that is, by faith and repentance.

   2. Many of those concerning whom we have the assurance mentioned were
   not only sinners but great sinners, as was said; which must be also
   insisted on, to obviate another objection. For some may say, that
   although they were sinners, yet they were not such sinners as we are;
   and although they obtained forgiveness, yet this is no argument that we
   shall do so also, who are guilty of other sins than they were, and
   those attended with other aggravations than theirs were. To which I
   say, that I delight not in aggravating, no, nor yet in repeating, the
   sins and faults of the saints of God of old. Not only the grace of God,
   but the sins of men have by some been turned into lasciviousness, or
   been made a cloak for their lusts. But yet, for the ends and purposes
   for which they are recorded by the Holy Ghost, we may make mention of
   them. That they may warn us of our duty, that we take heed lest we also
   fall, that they may yield us a relief under our surprisals, are they
   written. So, then, where the mention of them tends to the advancement
   of sovereign grace and mercy, which is the case in hand, we may insist
   on them. I think, then, that, without mention of particulars, I may
   safely say that there is no sin, no degree of sin, no aggravating
   circumstance of sin, no kind of continuance in sin (the only sin
   excepted), but that there are those in heaven who have been guilty of
   them.

   It may be, yet some will say that they have considered the sins and
   falls of Lot, David, Peter, Paul, and the thief himself on the cross,
   and yet they find not their own condition exemplified, so as to
   conclude that they shall have the same success with them.

   Ans. 1. I am not showing that this or that man shall be pardoned, but
   only demonstrating that there is forgiveness with God, and that for all
   sorts of sins and sinners; which these instances do assuredly confirm.
   And, moreover, they manifest that if other men are not pardoned, it is
   merely because they make not that application for forgiveness which
   they did.

   2. Yet by the way, to take off this objection also, consider what the
   apostle says in particular concerning the several sorts of sinners that
   obtained mercy: I Cor. vi. 9-11, "Be not deceived: neither fornicators,
   nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of
   themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor
   revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such
   were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are
   justified." Hell can scarce, in no more words, yield us a sadder
   catalogue. Yet some of all these sorts were justified and pardoned.

   3. Suppose this enumeration of sins doth not reach the condition of the
   soul, because of some especial aggravation of its sin not expressed; --
   let such a one add that of our Saviour: Matt. xii. 31, "I say unto you,
   All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but the
   blasphemy against the Holy Ghost." They are not, they shall not be, all
   actually remitted and pardoned unto all men; but they are all
   pardonable unto those that seek to obtain pardon for them according
   unto the gospel. There is with God forgiveness for them all. Now,
   certainly there is no sin, but only that excepted, but it comes within
   the compass of" All manner of sin and blasphemy;" and so, consequently,
   some that have been guilty of it are now in heaven.

   We take it for a good token and evidence of a virtuous healing water,
   when, without fraud or pretence, we see the crutches of cured cripples
   and impotent persons hung about it as a memorial of its efficacy. And
   it is a great demonstration of the skill and ability of a physician,
   when many come to a sick person and tell him "We had the same distemper
   with you, -- it had the same symptoms, the same effects; and by his
   skill and care we are cured." "Oh!" saith the sick man, "bring him unto
   me, I will venture my life in his band." Now, all the saints of heaven
   stand about a sin-sick soul; for in this matter "we are compassed about
   with a cloud of witnesses," Heb. xii. 1. And what do they bear witness
   unto? what say they unto a poor guilty sinner? "As thou art, so were
   we; so guilty, so perplexed, so obnoxious to wrath, so fearing
   destruction from God." "And what way did you steer, what course did you
   take, to obtain the blessed condition wherein now you are?" Say they,
   "We went all to God through Christ for forgiveness; and found plenty of
   grace, mercy, and pardon in him for us all." The rich man in the
   parable thought it would be a great means of conversion if one should
   "rise from the dead" and preach; but here we see that all the saints
   departed and now in glory do jointly preach this fundamental truth,
   that "there is forgiveness with God."

   Poor souls are apt to think that all those whom they read or hear of to
   be gone to heaven, went thither because they were so good and so holy.
   It is true many of them were eminently and exemplarily so in their
   generations, all of them were so according to their degrees and
   measures; for "without holiness no man can see God," -- and it is our
   duty to labour to be like unto them in holiness, if ever we intend to
   be so in happiness and glory; -- but yet not one of them, not any one
   that is now in heaven, Jesus Christ alone excepted, did ever come
   thither any other way but by forgiveness of sin; and that will also
   bring us thither, though we come short of many of them in holiness and
   grace.

   And this evidence of forgiveness! the rather urge, because I find the
   apostle Paul doing of it eminently in his own person: 1 Tim. i. 12-16,
   "I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he
   counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; who was before a
   blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy,
   because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was
   exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. This
   is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
   came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. Howbeit for
   this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew
   forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter
   believe on him to life everlasting." "A great sinner," saith he, "the
   chiefest of sinners I was;" which he manifests by some notable
   instances of his sin. "I was," saith he, "a blasphemer," -- the highest
   sin against God; "a persecutor," -- the highest sin against the saints;
   "injurious," -- the highest wickedness towards mankind. "But," saith
   he, "I obtained mercy, I am pardoned;" -- and that with a blessed
   effect; first, that he should after all this be so accounted faithful
   as to be put into the ministry; and then that the grace of our Lord
   Jesus Christ in him and towards him was exceeding abundant. And what
   was the reason, what was the cause, that he was thus dealt withal? Why,
   it was that he might be a pattern, an evidence, an argument, that there
   was grace, mercy, forgiveness, to be had for all sorts of sinners that
   would believe to life everlasting.

   To conclude, then, this evidence -- Every one who is now in heaven hath
   his pardon sealed in the blood of Christ. All these pardons are, as it
   were, hanged up in the gospel; they are all enrolled in the promises
   thereof, for the encouragement of them that stand in need of
   forgiveness to come and sue out theirs also. Fear not, then, the guilt
   of sin, but the love of it and the power of it. If we love and like sin
   better than forgiveness, we shall assuredly go without it. If we had
   but rather be pardoned in God's way than perish, our condition is
   secure.

   V. The same is evident from the patience of God towards the world, and
   the end of it For the clearing hereof we may observe, --

   1. That upon the first entrance of sin and breach of that covenant
   which God had made with mankind in Adam, he might immediately have
   executed the threatened curse, and have brought eternal death upon them
   that sinned. Justice required that it should be so, and there was
   nothing in the whole creation to interpose so much as for a reprieve or
   a respite of vengeance. And had God then sent sinning man, with the
   apostate angels that induced him into sin, immediately into eternal
   destruction, he would have been glorified in his righteousness and
   severity by and among the angels that sinned not. Or he could have
   created a new race of innocent creatures to have worshipped him and
   glorified him for his righteous judgment, even as the elect at the last
   day shall do for the destruction of ungodly men.

   2. God hath not taken this course. He hath continued the race of
   mankind for a long season on the earth; he hath watched over them with
   his providence, and exercised exceeding patience, forbearance, and
   long-suffering towards them. Thus the apostle Paul at large discourseth
   on, Acts xiv. 15-17, xvii. 24-30, as also Rom. ii. 4. And it is open
   and manifest in their event. The whole world is every day filled with
   tokens of the power and patience of God; every nation, every city,
   every family is filled with them.

   3. That there is a common abuse of this patience of God visible in the
   world in all generations. So it was of old: God saw it to be so, and
   complained of it, Gen. vi. 5, 6. All the evil, sin, wickedness, that
   hath been in the world, which no heart can conceive, no tongue can
   express, hath been all an abuse of this patience of God. This, with the
   most, is the consequent of God's patience and forbearance. Men count it
   a season to fulfil all the abominations that their evil hearts can
   suggest unto them, or Satan draw them into a combination with himself
   in. This the state of things in the world proclaims, and every one's
   experience confirms.

   4. Let us, therefore, consider what is the true and proper end of this
   patience of God towards the world, enduring it in sin and wickedness
   for so long a season, and suffering one generation to be multiplied
   after another. Shall we think that God hath no ether design in all this
   patience towards mankind, in all generations, but merely to suffer
   them, all and every one, without exception, to sin against him,
   dishonour him, provoke him, that so he may at length everlastingly
   destroy them all? It is confessed that this is the consequent, the
   event of it with the most, through their perverse wickedness, with
   their love of sin and pleasure. But is this the design of God, -- his
   only design? Hath he no other purpose but merely to forbear them a
   while in their folly, and then to avenge himself upon them? Is this his
   intendment, not only towards those who are obstinate in their darkness,
   ignorance, and rebellion against him, whose "damnation is just, and
   sleepeth not," but also towards those whom he stirs up by his grace to
   seek after a remedy and deliverance from the state of sin and death?
   God forbid; yea, such an apprehension would be contrary to all those
   notions of the infinite wisdom and goodness of God which are ingrafted
   upon our hearts by nature, and which all his works manifest and
   declare. Whatever, therefore, it be, this cannot be the design of God
   in his patience towards the world. It cannot be but that he must long
   since have cut off the whole race of mankind, if he had no other
   thoughts and purposes towards them.

   5. If this patience of God hath any other intention towards any, any
   other effect upon some, upon any, that is to be reckoned the principal
   end of it, and for the sake whereof it is evidently extended unto some
   others, consequentially unto all. For those concerning whom God hath an
   especial design in his patience, being to be brought forth in the world
   after the ordinary way of mankind, and that in all ages during the
   continuance of the world, from the beginning unto the end thereof, the
   patience which is extended unto them must also of necessity reach unto
   all in that variety wherein God is pleased to exercise it. The whole
   world, therefore, is continued under the patience of God and the fruits
   of it, for the sake of some that are in it.

   6. Let us, therefore, see what is the end of this patience, and what it
   teacheth us. Now, it can have no end possible but only that before
   rejected, unless there be forgiveness of sins with God. Unless God be
   ready and willing to forgive the sins of them that come to him
   according unto his appointment, his patience is merely subservient unto
   a design of wrath, anger, severity, and a resolution to destroy. Now,
   this is an abomination once to suppose, and would reflect unspeakable
   dishonour upon the holy God. Let a man but deal thus, and it is a token
   of as evil an habit of mind, and perverse, as any can befall him. Let
   him bear with those that are in his power in their faults, for no other
   end or with no other design but that he may take advantage to bring a
   greater punishment and revenge upon them; and what more vile affection,
   what more wretched corruption of heart and mind, can he manifest? And
   shall we think that this is the whole design of the patience of God?
   God forbid.

   It may be objected "That this argument is not cogent, because of the
   instance that lies against it in God's dealing with the angels that
   sinned. It is evident that they fell into their transgression and
   apostasy before mankind did so, for they led and seduced our first
   parents into sin; and yet God bears with them, and exerciseth patience
   towards them, to this very day, and will do so unto the consummation of
   all things, when they shall be east into the fire prepared for the
   devil and his angels;' and yet it is granted that there is no
   forgiveness in God for them: so that it cloth not necessarily follow
   that there is so for man, because of his patience towards them."

   I answer, that this must be more fully spoken unto when we come to
   remove that great objection against this whole truth which was
   mentioned before, taken from God's dealing with the sinning angels,
   whom he spared not. At present two or three observations will remove it
   out of our way; for, --

   (1.) The case is not the same with the sinning angels and the race of
   mankind in all generations. There are no other angels in this
   condition, but only those individuals who first sinned in their own
   persons. They are not, in the providence and patience of God,
   multiplied and increased in ensuing times and seasons, but they
   continue the same individual persons who first sinned, and no more; so
   that immediate execution of the whole punishment due unto their sin
   would not have prevented any increase of them. But now with man it is
   otherwise; for God continues his patience towards them to the
   production of millions of other persons, who were not actually in the
   first sin. Had not God so continued his forbearance, their being, and
   consequently their sin and misery, had been prevented; so that the case
   is not the same with sinning angels and men.

   (2.) Indeed God exerciseth no patience toward the angels that sinned,
   and that because he had no forgiveness for them. So Peter tells us, 2
   Epist. ii. 4, "God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them
   down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness." Immediately
   upon their sin they were cast out of the presence of God, whose vision
   and enjoyment they were made for, and which they received some
   experience of; and they were cast into hell, as the place of their
   ordinary retention and of their present anguish, under the sense of
   God's curse and displeasure. And although they may some of them be
   permitted to compass the earth, and to walk to and fro therein, to
   serve the ends of God's holy, wise providence, and so to be out of
   their prison, yet they are still in their chains; for they were
   delivered unto chains of darkness, to be kept unto the last judgment.
   And in these things they lie actually under the execution of the curse
   of God, so that there is indeed no patience exercised towards them. If
   a notorious malefactor or murderer be committed unto a dungeon, and
   kept bound with iron chains to prevent his escape, until the appointed
   day of his solemn judgment and execution, without the least intention
   to spare him, none will say there is patience exercised towards him,
   things being disposed only so as that his punishment may be secure and
   severe. And such is the case, such is the condition of the angels that
   sinned; who are not, therefore, to be esteemed objects of God's
   patience.

   (3.) The reason why the full and final punishment of these angels is
   reserved and respited unto the appointed season is not for their own
   sakes, their good, benefit, or advantage at all, but merely that the
   end of God's patience towards mankind might be accomplished. When this
   is once brought about they shall not be spared a day, an hour, a
   moment. So that God's dispensation towards them is nothing but a mere
   withholding the infliction of the utmost of their punishment, until he
   hath accomplished the blessed ends of his patience towards mankind.

   But you will say, secondly, "Is it not said that God, willing to shew
   his wrath, and to make his power known, endures with much
   long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction?' Rom. ix.
   22; so that it seems that the end of God's endurance and
   long-suffering, to some at least, is only their fitting unto
   destruction."

   Ans. 1. It is one thing to endure with much long-suffering, another
   thing to exercise and declare patience. The former only intimates God's
   withholding for a season of that destruction which he might justly
   inflict, which we speak not of; the other denotes an acting in a way of
   goodness and kindness for some especial end.

   2. The next verse declares the great end of God's patience, and answers
   this objection: "That he might make known the riches of his glory on
   the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory," verse
   23. This is the great end of God's patience, which whilst he is in the
   pursuit of towards the vessels of mercy, he endureth others with much
   long-suffering and forbearance. This, then, is fully evident, that
   there could be no sufficient reason assigned of the patience of God
   towards sinners, but that there is forgiveness prepared for them that
   come to him by Christ.

   And this the Scripture clearly testifies unto, 2 Pet. iii. 9. The
   question is, What is the reason why God forbears the execution of his
   judgment upon wicked and ungodly men? Some would have it that God is
   slack, that is, regardless of the sins of men, and takes no notice of
   them. "No," saith the apostle; "God hath another design in his patience
   and long-suffering." What is this? "It is to manifest that he is not
   willing we should perish." That is it which we have proved; for our
   freedom from destruction is by repentance, which necessarily infers the
   forgiveness of sin. So Paul tells us that in the gospel is declared
   what is the end of God's patience and forbearance: "It is," saith he,
   "the remission of sins," Rom. iii. 25.

   Let us, therefore, also mind this evidence in the application of
   ourselves to God for pardon. It is certain that God might have taken us
   from the womb, and have cast us into utter darkness; and in the course
   of our lives we have been guilty of such provocations as God might
   justly have taken the advantage of to glorify his justice and severity
   in our ruin; but yet we have lived thus long, in the patience and
   forbearance of God. And to what end hath he thus spared us, and let
   pass those advantages for our destruction that we have put into his
   hand? Is it not that he might by his patience give us leave and space
   to get an interest in that forgiveness which he thus testifies to be in
   himself? Let us, then, be encouraged by it to use it unto the end and
   purpose for which it is exercised towards us. You that are yet in doubt
   of your condition, consider that the patience of God was extended unto
   you this day, this very day, that you might use it for the obtaining of
   the remission of your sins. Lose not this day, nor one day more, as you
   love your souls; for woful will be their condition who shall perish for
   despising or abusing the patience of God.

   VI. The faith and experience of the saints in this world give in
   testimony unto this truth; and we know that their record in this matter
   is true. Let us, then, ask of them what they believe, what they have
   found, what they have experience of, as to the forgiveness of sin. This
   God himself directs and leads us unto by appealing unto our own
   experience, whence he shows us that we may take relief and supportment
   in our distresses: Isa. xl. 28, "Hast thou not known? hast thou not
   heard?" -- "Hast not thou thyself, who now criest out that thou art
   lost and undone because God hath forsaken thee, found and known by
   experience the contrary, from his former dealings with thee?" And if
   our own experiences may confirm us against the workings of our
   unbelief, so may those of others also. And this is that which Eliphaz
   directs Job unto, chap. v. 1, "Call now, if there be any that will
   answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou look?" It is not a
   supplication to them for help that is intended, but an inquiry after
   their experience in the case in hand, wherein he wrongfully thought
   they could not justify Job. v'lmy mqdsym tphnh?, "To which of the
   saints, on the right hand or left, wilt thou have regard in this
   matter?" Some would foolishly hence seek to confirm the invocation of
   the saints departed; when, indeed, if they were intended, it is rather
   forbidden and discountenanced than directed unto. But the qdsym? here
   are the qdvsym 'sr v'rts?, Ps. xvi. 2, "The saints that are in the
   earth," whose experiences Job is directed to inquire into and after.
   David makes it a great encouragement unto waiting upon God, as a God
   hearing prayer, that others had done so and found success: Ps. xxxiv.
   6, "This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of
   all his troubles." If he did so, and had that blessed issue, why should
   not we do so also? The experiences of one axe often proposed for the
   confirmation and establishment of others. So the same David: "Come,"
   saith he, "and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he
   hath done for my soul." He contents not himself to mind them of the
   word, promises, and providence of God, which he doth most frequently;
   but he will give them the encouragement and supportment also of his own
   experience. So Paul tells us that he "was comforted of God in all his
   tribulation, that he might be able to comfort them which are in any
   trouble, by the comfort wherewith he himself was comforted of God," 2
   Cor. i. 4; that is, that he might be able to communicate unto them his
   own experience of God's dealing with him, and the satisfaction and
   assurance that he found therein. So also he proposeth the example of
   God's dealing with him in the pardon of his sins as a great motive unto
   others to believe, 1 Tim. i. 18-16. And this mutual communication of
   satisfying experiences in the things of God, or of our spiritual sense
   and evidence of the power, efficacy, and reality of gospel truths,
   being rightly managed, is of singular use to all sorts of believers. So
   the same great apostle acquaints us in his own example, Rom. i. 11, 12,
   "I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to
   the end ye may be established; that is, that I may be comforted
   together with you, by the mutual faith both of you and me." He longed
   not only to be instructing of them, in the pursuit of the work of the
   ministry committed unto him, but to confer also with them about their
   mutual faith, and what experiences of the peace of God in believing
   they had attained.

   We have in our case called in the testimony of the saints in heaven,
   with whom those on earth do make up one family, even that one family in
   heaven and earth which is called after the name of the Father of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, Eph. iii. 14, 15. And they all agree in their
   testimony, as becomes the family and children of God. But those below
   we may deal personally with; whereas we gather the witness of the other
   only from what is left upon record concerning them. And for the
   clearing of this evidence sundry things are to be observed; as, --

   1. Men living under the profession of religion, and not experiencing
   the power, virtue, and efficacy of it in their hearts, are, whatever
   they profess, very near to atheism, or at least exposed to great
   temptations thereunto. If "they profess they know God, but in works
   deny him," they are "abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good
   work reprobate," Tit. i. 16. Let such men lay aside tradition and
   custom, let them give up themselves to a free and a rational
   consideration of things, and they will quickly find that all their
   profession is but a miserable self-deceiving, and that, indeed, they
   believe not one word of the religion which they profess: for of what
   their religion affirms to be in themselves they find not any thing true
   or real; and what reason have they, then, to believe that the things
   which it speaks of that are without them are one jot better? If they
   have no experience of what it affirms to be within them, what
   confidence can they have of the reality of what it reveals to be
   without them? John tells us that "he who saith he loves God whom he
   hath not seen, and doth not love his brother whom he hath seen, is a
   liar." Men who do not things of an equal concernment unto them wherein
   they may be tried, are not to be believed in what they profess about
   greater things, whereof no trial can be had. So he that believes not,
   who experienceth not, the power of that which the religion he
   professeth affirms to be in him, if he says that he doth believe other
   things which he can have no experience of, he is a liar. For instance,
   he that professeth the gospel avows that the death of Christ doth
   crucify sin; that faith purifieth the heart; that the Holy Ghost
   quickens and enables the soul unto duty; that God is good and gracious
   unto all that come unto him; that there is precious communion to be
   obtained with him by Christ; that there is great joy in believing.
   These things are plainly, openly, frequently insisted on in the gospel
   Hence the apostle presseth men unto obedience on the account of them;
   and, as it were, leaves them at liberty from it if they were not so,
   Phil. ii. 1, 2. Now, if men have lived long in the profession of these
   things, saying that they are so, but indeed find nothing of truth,
   reality, or power in them, have no experience of the effects of them in
   their own hearts or souls, what stable ground have they of believing
   any thing else in the gospel whereof they cannot have experience? A man
   professeth that the death of Christ will mortify sin and subdue
   corruption; why doth he believe it? Because it is so affirmed in the
   gospel. How, then, doth he find it to be so? hath it this effect upon
   his soul, in his own heart? Not at all; he finds no such thing in him.
   How, then, can this man believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God
   because it is affirmed in the gospel, seeing that he finds no real
   truth of that which it affirms to be in himself? So our Saviour argues,
   John iii. 12, "If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not,
   how will ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?" -- "If you believe
   not the doctrine of regeneration, which you ought to have experience
   of, as a thing that is wrought in the hearts of men on the earth, how
   can you assent unto those heavenly mysteries of the gospel which at
   first are to be received by a pure act of faith, without any present
   sense or experience?"

   Of all dangers, therefore, in profession, let professors take heed of
   this, -- namely, of a customary, traditional, or doctrinal owning such
   truths as ought to have their effects and accomplishment in themselves,
   whilst they have no experience of the reality and efficacy of them.
   This is plainly to have a form of godliness, and to deny the power
   thereof. And of this sort of men do we see many turning atheists,
   scoffers, and open apostates. They find in themselves that their
   profession was a lie, and that in truth they had none of those things
   which they talked of; and to what end should they continue longer in
   the avowing of that which is not? Besides, finding those things which
   they have professed to be in them not to be so, they think that what
   they have believed of the things that are without them are of no other
   nature; and so reject them altogether.

   You will say, then, "What shall a man do who cannot find or obtain an
   experience in himself of what is affirmed in the word? He cannot find
   the death of Christ crucifying sin in him, and he cannot find the Holy
   Ghost sanctifying his nature, or obtain joy in believing; what shall
   he, then, do? shall he not believe or profess those things to be so,
   because he cannot obtain a blessed experience of them?" I answer, our
   Saviour hath perfectly given direction in this case: John vii. 17, "If
   any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be
   of God, or whether I speak of myself." Continue in following after the
   things revealed in the doctrine of the gospel, and you shall have a
   satisfactory experience that they are true, and that they are of God.
   Cease not to act faith on them, and you shall find their effects; for
   "then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord," Hos. vi. 3.
   Experience will ensue upon permanency in faith and obedience; yea, the
   first act of sincere believing will be accompanied with such a taste,
   will give the soul so much experience, as to produce a firm adherence
   unto the things believed. And this is the way to "prove what is that
   good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God," which is revealed unto
   us, Rom. xii. 2.

   2. Where there is an inward, spiritual experience of the power,
   reality, and efficacy of any supernatural truth, it gives great
   satisfaction, stability, and assurance unto the soul. It puts the soul
   out of danger or suspicion of being deceived, and gives it to have the
   testimony of God in itself. So the apostle tells us, "He that believeth
   on the Son of God hath the witness in himself," 1 John v. 10. He had
   discoursed of the manifold testimony that is given in heaven by all the
   holy persons of the Trinity, and on earth by grace and ordinances, unto
   the forgiveness of sin and eternal life to be obtained by Jesus Christ.
   And this record is true, firm, and stable, an abiding foundation for
   souls to rest upon, that will never deceive them. But yet all this
   while it is without us, -- it is that which we have no experience of in
   ourselves; only we rest upon it because of the authority and
   faithfulness of them that gave it. But now he that actually believeth,
   he hath the testimony in himself; he hath by experience a real evidence
   and assurance of the filings testified unto, -- namely, "That God hath
   given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son," verse 11. Let
   us, then, a little consider wherein this evidence consisteth, and from
   whence this assurance ariseth. To this end some few things must be
   considered; as, --

   (1.) That there is a great answerableness and correspondency between
   the heart of a believer and the truth that he doth believe. As the word
   is in the gospel, so is grace in the heart; yea, they are the same
   thing variously expressed: Rom. vi. 1 7, "Ye have obeyed from the
   heart," eis hon paredothete tupon didaches, "that form of doctrine
   which was delivered you." As our translation doth not, so I know not
   how in so few words to express that which is emphatically here
   insinuated by the Holy Ghost. The meaning is, that the doctrine of the
   gospel begets the form, figure, image, or likeness of itself in the
   hearts of them that believe, so they are cast into the mould of it. As
   is the one, so is the other. The principle of grace in the heart and
   that in the word are as children of the same parent, completely
   resembling and representing one another. Grace is a living word, and
   the word is figured, limned grace. As is regeneration, so is a
   regenerate heart; as is the doctrine of faith, so is a believer. And
   this gives great evidence unto and assurance of the things that are
   believed: "As we have heard, so we have seen and found it." Such a soul
   can produce the duplicate of the word, and so adjust all things
   thereby.

   (2.) That the first original expression of divine truth is not in the
   word, no, not as given out from the infinite abyss of divine wisdom and
   veracity, but it is first hid, laid up, and expressed in the person of
   Christ. He is the archetupos, the first pattern of truth, which from
   him is expressed in the word, and from and by the word impressed in the
   hearts of believers: so that as it hath pleased God that all the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge should be in him, dwell in him, have
   their principal residence in him, Col. ii. 3; so the whole word is but
   a revelation of the truth in Christ, or an expression of his image and
   likeness to the sons of men. Thus we are said to learn "the truth as it
   is in Jesus," Eph. iv. 21. It is in Jesus originally and really; and
   from him it is communicated unto us by the word. We are thereby taught
   and do learn it, for thereby, as the apostle proceeds, "we are renewed
   in the spirit of our mind, and do put on the new man, which after God
   is created in righteousness and true holiness," verses 23, 24. First,
   the truth is in Jesus, then it is expressed in the word; this word
   learned and believed becomes grace in the heart, every way answering
   unto the Lord Christ his image, from whom this transforming truth did
   thus proceed. Nay, this is carried by the apostle yet higher, namely,
   unto God the Father himself, whose image Christ is, and believers his
   through the word: 2 Cor. iii. 18, "We all, with open face beholding as
   in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from
   glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord;" whereunto add chap. iv.
   6, "God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined
   in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
   in the face of Jesus Christ." The first pattern or example of all truth
   and holiness is God himself; hereof "Christ is the image," verse 4.
   Christ is the image of God, "The brightness of his glory, and the
   express image of his person," Heb. i. 8; "The image of the invisible
   God," Col. i. 15. Hence we are said to "see the glory of God in the
   face of Jesus Christ;" because he being his image, the love, grace, and
   truth of the Father are represented and made conspicuous in him: for we
   are said to "behold it in his face," because of the open and
   illustrious manifestation of the glory of God in him. And how do we
   behold this glory? In a glass, -- "As in a glass;" that is, in the
   gospel, which hath the image and likeness of Christ, who is the image
   of God, reflected upon it and communicated unto it. So have we traced
   truth and grace from the person of the Father unto the Son as a
   mediator, and thence transfused into the word. In the Father it is
   essentially; in Jesus Christ originally and exemplarily; and in the
   word as in a transcript or copy. But doth it abide there? No; God by
   the word of the gospel "shines in our hearts," 2 Cor. iv. 6. He
   irradiates our minds with a saving light into it and apprehension of
   it. And what thence ensues? The soul of a believer is "changed into the
   same image" by the effectual working of the Holy Ghost, chap. iii. 18;
   that is, the likeness of Christ implanted on the word is impressed on
   the soul itself, whereby it is renewed into the image of God, whereunto
   it was at first created. This brings all into a perfect harmony. There
   is not, where gospel truth is effectually received and experienced in
   the soul, only a consonancy merely between the soul and the word, but
   between the soul and Christ by the word, and the soul and God by
   Christ. And this gives assured establishment unto the soul in the
   things that it doth believe. Divine truth so conveyed unto us is firm,
   stable, and immovable; and we can say of it in a spiritual sense," That
   which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, which we
   have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life,' we
   know to be true." Yea, a believer is a testimony to the certainty of
   truth in what he is, much beyond what he is in all that he saith. Words
   may be pretended; real effects have their testimony inseparably annexed
   unto them.

   (3.) Hence it appears that there must needs be great assurance of those
   truths which are thus received and believed; for hereby are "the senses
   exercised to discern both good and evil," Heb. v. 14. Where there is a
   spiritual sense of truth, of the good and evil that is in doctrines,
   from an inward experience of what is so good, and from thence an
   aversation unto the contrary, and this obtained dia ten hexin, by
   reason of a habit or an habitual frame of heart, there is strength,
   there is steadfastness and assurance. This is the teaching of the
   unction, which will not, which cannot, deceive. Hence many of old and
   of late that could not dispute could yet die for the truth. He that
   came to another, and went about to prove by sophistical reasonings that
   there was no such thing as motion, had only this return from him, who
   either was not able to answer his cavilling or unwilling to put himself
   to trouble about it, -- he arose, and, walking up and down, gave him a
   real confutation of his sophistry. It is so in this case. When a soul
   hath a real experience of the grace of God, of the pardon of sins, of
   the virtue and efficacy of the death of Christ, of justification by his
   blood, and peace with God by believing; let men, or devils, or angels
   from heaven, oppose these things, if it cannot answer their sophisms,
   yet he can rise up and walk, -- he can, with all holy confidence and
   assurance, oppose his own satisfying experience unto all their arguings
   and suggestions. A man will not be disputed out of what he sees and
   feels; and a believer will abide as firmly by his spiritual sense as
   any man can by his natural.

   This is the meaning of that prayer of the apostle, Col. ii. 2, "That
   your hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto
   all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the
   acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of
   Christ." Understanding in the mysteries of the gospel they had; but he
   prays that, by a farther experience of it, they might come to the
   "assurance of understanding." To be true, is the property of the
   doctrine itself; to be certain or assured, is the property of our
   minds. Now, this experience doth so unite the mind and truth, that we
   say, "Such a truth is most certain;" whereas certainty is indeed the
   property of our minds or their knowledge, and not of the truth known.
   It is certain unto us; that is, we have an assured knowledge of it by
   the experience we have of it. This is the assurance of understanding
   here mentioned. And he farther prays that we may come to the "riches"
   of this assurance, -- that is, to an abundant, plentiful assurance; and
   that eis epignosin, "to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God,"
   owning it from a sense and experience of its excellency and worth.

   And this is in the nature of all gospel truths, -- they are fitted and
   suited to be experienced by a believing soul. There is nothing in them
   so sublime and high, nothing so mysterious, nothing so seemingly low
   and outwardly contemptible, but that a gracious soul hath experience of
   an excellency, reality, power, and efficacy in it all. For instance,
   look on that which concerns the order and worship of the gospel. This
   seems to many to be a mere external thing, whereof a soul can have no
   inward sense or relish. Notions there are many about it, and endless
   contentions, but what more? Why, let a gracious soul, in simplicity and
   sincerity of spirit, give up himself to walk with Christ according to
   his appointment, and he shall quickly find such a taste and relish in
   the fellowship of the gospel, in the communion of saints, and of Christ
   amongst them, as that he shall come up to such riches of assurance in
   the understanding and acknowledgment of the ways of the Lord, as others
   by their disputing can never attain unto. What is so high, glorious,
   and mysterious as the doctrine of the ever-blessed Trinity? Some wise
   men have thought meet to keep it vailed from ordinary Christians, and
   some have delivered it in such terms as that they can understand
   nothing by them. But take a believer who hath tasted how gracious the
   Lord is, in the eternal love of the Father, the great undertaking of
   the Son in the work of mediation and redemption, with the almighty work
   of the Spirit creating grace and comfort in the soul; and hath had an
   experience of the love, holiness, and power of God in them all; and he
   will with more firm confidence adhere to this mysterious truth, being
   led into it and confirmed in it by some few plain testimonies of the
   word, than a thousand disputers shall do who only have the notion of it
   in their minds. Let a real trial come, and this will appear. Few will
   be found to sacrifice their lives on bare speculations. Experience will
   give assurance and stability.

   We have thus cleared the credit of the testimony now to be improved. It
   is evident, on these grounds, that there is a great certainty in those
   truths whereof believers have experience. Where they communicate their
   power unto the heart, they give an unquestionable assurance of their
   truth; and when that is once realized in the soul, all disputes about
   it are put to silence.

   These things being so, let us inquire into the faith and experience of
   the saints on the earth as to what they know of the truth proposed unto
   confirmation, namely, that there is forgiveness with God. Let us go to
   some poor soul that now walks comfortably under the light of God's
   countenance, and say unto him, "Did we not know you some while since to
   be full of sadness and great anxiety of spirit; yea, sorrowful almost
   to death, and bitter in soul?" -- Ans. "Yes," saith he, "so it was,
   indeed. My days were consumed with mourning, and my life with sorrow;
   and I walked heavily, in fear and bitterness of spirit, all the day
   long."

   "Why, what ailed you, what was the matter with you, seeing as to
   outward things you were in peace?" -- Ans. "The law of God had laid
   hold upon me and slain me. I found myself thereby a woful sinner, yea,
   overwhelmed with the guilt of sin. Every moment I expected tribulation
   and wrath from the hand of God; my sore ran in the night and ceased
   not, and my soul refused comfort."

   "How is it, then, that you are thus delivered, that you are no more
   sad? Where have you found ease and peace? Have you been by any means
   delivered, or did your trouble wear off and depart of its own accord?"
   -- Ans. "Alas, no! had I not met with an effectual remedy, I had sunk
   and everlastingly perished."

   "What course did you take?" -- Ans. "I went unto Him by Jesus Christ
   against whom I have sinned, and have found him better unto me than I
   could expect or ever should have believed, had not he overpowered my
   heart by his Spirit. Instead of wrath, which I feared, and that justly,
   because I had deserved it, he said unto me in Christ, Fury is not in
   me.' For a long time I thought it impossible that there should be mercy
   and pardon for me, or such a one as I. But he still supported me,
   sometimes by one means, sometimes by another; until, taking my soul
   near to himself, he caused me to see the folly of my unbelieving heart,
   and the vileness of the hard thoughts I had of him, and that, indeed,
   there is with him forgiveness and plenteous redemption. This hath taken
   away all my sorrows, and given me quietness, with rest and assurance."

   "But are you sure, now, that this is so? May you not possibly be
   deceived?" -- Ans. Says the soul, "I have not the least suspicion of
   any such matter; and if at any time aught doth arise to that purpose,
   it is quickly overcome."

   "But how are you confirmed in this persuasion?" -- Ans. "That sense of
   it which I have in my heart; that sweetness and rest which I have
   experience of; that influence it hath upon my soul; that obligation I
   find laid upon me by it unto all thankful obedience; that relief,
   supportment, and consolation that it hath afforded me in trials and
   troubles, in the mouth of the grave and entrances of eternity, -- all
   answering what is declared concerning these things in the word, -- will
   not suffer me to be deceived. I could not, indeed, receive it until God
   was pleased to speak it unto me; but now let Satan do his utmost, I
   shall never cease to bear this testimony, that there is mercy and
   forgiveness with him."

   How many thousands may we find of these in the world, who have had such
   a seal of this truth in their hearts, as they can not only securely lay
   down their lives in the confirmation of it, if called thereunto, but
   also do cheerfully and triumphantly venture their eternal concernments
   upon it! yea, this is the rise of all that peace, serenity of mind, and
   strong consolation, which in this world they are made partakers of.

   Now this is to me, on the principles before laid down, an evidence
   great and important. God hath not manifested this truth unto the
   saints, thus copied it out of his word, and exemplified it in their
   souls, to leave them under any possibility of being deceived.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Institution of religious worship an evidence of forgiveness.

   VII. God's institution of religious worship, and honour therein to be
   rendered unto him by sinners, is another evidence that there is
   forgiveness with him. I have instanced before in one particular of
   worship to this purpose, -- namely, in that of sacrifices; but therein
   we intended only their particular nature and signification, how they
   declared and manifested reconciliation, atonement, and pardon. That now
   aimed at is, to show how all the worship that God hath appointed unto
   us, and all the honour which we give unto his holy majesty thereby, is
   built upon the same foundation, -- namely, a supposition of
   forgiveness, -- and is appointed to teach it, and to ascertain us of
   it; which shall briefly be declared. To this end observe, --

   1. That the general end of all divine and religious worship is to raise
   unto God a revenue of glory out of the creation. Such is God's infinite
   natural self-sufficiency, that he stands in need of no such glory and
   honour. He was in himself no less infinitely and eternally glorious
   before the creation of all or any thing whatever, than he will be when
   he shall be encompassed about with the praises of all the works of his
   hands. And such is his absolute perfection, that no honour given unto
   him, no admiration of him, no ascription of glory and praise, can add
   any thing unto him. Hence saith the psalmist, "My goodness extendeth
   not to thee," Ps. xvi. 2; -- "It doth not so reach thee as to add unto
   thee, to profit thee, as it may do the saints that are on earth." As he
   in Job, chap. xxii. 2, 3, "Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that
   is wise may be profitable unto himself? Is it any pleasure to the
   Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou
   makest thy ways perfect?" There is no doubt but that it is
   well-pleasing unto God that we should be righteous and upright; but we
   do him not a pleasure therein, as though he stood in need of it, or it
   were advantage or gain unto him. And again, chap. xxxv. 7, "If thou be
   righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he at thine hand?"
   And the reason of all this the apostle gives us, Rom. xi. 36, "Of him,
   and through him, and to him, are all things." Being the first sovereign
   cause and last absolute end of all things, every way perfect and
   self-sufficient, nothing can be added unto him: or, as the same apostle
   speaks, "God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
   is Lord of heaven and earth, is not worshipped with men's hands, as
   though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth unto all life, and breath,
   and all things," Acts xvii. 24, 25; as he himself pleads at large, Ps.
   l. 7-13.

   2. Wherefore, all the revenue of glory that God will receive by his
   worship depends merely on his own voluntary choice and appointment. All
   worship, I say, depends now on the sovereign will and pleasure of God.
   It is true there is a natural worship due from rational creatures by
   the law of their creation. This was indispensably and absolutely
   necessary at first. The very being of God and order of things required
   that it should be so. Supposing that God had made such creatures as we
   are, it could not be but that moral obedience was due unto him, --
   namely, that he should be believed in, trusted, and obeyed, as the
   first cause, last end, and sovereign Lord of all. But the entrance of
   sin, laying the sinner absolutely under the curse of God, utterly put
   an end to this order of things. Man was now to have perished
   immediately, and an end to be put unto the law of this obedience. But
   here, in the sovereign will of God, an interposition was made between
   sin and the sentence, and man was respited from destruction. All
   worship following hereon, even that which was before natural, by the
   law of creation, is now resolved into an arbitrary act of God's will.

   And unto this end is all worship designed, -- namely, to give glory
   unto God. For as God hath said that "he will be sanctified in all that
   draw nigh him," -- that is, in his worship, -- and that therein "he
   will be glorified," Lev. x. 3; and that "he that offereth him praise,"
   -- that is, performeth any part of his worship and service, --
   "glorifieth him," Ps. l. 23: so the nature of the thing itself
   declareth that it can have no other end. By this he hath all his glory,
   even from the inanimate creation.

   3. Consider that God hath not prescribed any worship of himself unto
   the angels that sinned. They are, indeed, under his power, and he useth
   them as he pleaseth, to serve the ends of his holy providence. Bounds
   he prescribes unto them by his power, and keeps them in dread of the
   full execution of his wrath; but he requires not of them that they
   should believe in him. They believe, indeed, and tremble. They have a
   natural apprehension of the being, power, providence, holiness, and
   righteousness of God, which is inseparable from their natures; and they
   have an expectation from thence of that punishment and vengeance which
   is due unto them, which is inseparable from them as sinners; and this
   is their faith: but to believe in God, -- that is, to put their trust
   in him, to resign up themselves unto him, -- God requires it not of
   them. The same is the case with them also as to love, and fear, and
   delight, -- all inward affections, which are the proper worship of God.
   These they have not, nor doth God any longer require them in them. They
   eternally cast them off in their first sin. And where these are not,
   where they are not required, where they cannot be, there no outward
   worship can be prescribed or appointed; for external instituted worship
   is nothing but the way that God assigns and chooseth us to express and
   exercise the inward affections of our minds towards him. He rules the
   fallen angels "per nutum providentiÃ¦," not "verbum prÃ¦cepti." Now, as
   God dealt with the angels, so also would he have dealt with mankind,
   had he left them all under the curse, without remedy or hope of relief.
   As he doth with them, -- he eternally satisfies himself in that revenue
   of glory which ariseth unto him in their punishment, -- so also he
   would have done with these, had there been no forgiveness with him for
   them. He would not have required them to fear, love, or obey him, or
   have appointed unto them any way of worship whereby to express such
   affections towards him; for to what end should he have done it? What
   righteousness would admit that service, duty, and obedience should be
   prescribed unto them who could not, ought not to have any expectation
   or hope of acceptance or reward? This is contrary to the very first
   notion which God requires in us of his nature: for "he that cometh to
   God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
   diligently seek him," Heb. xi. 6; which would not be so should he
   appoint a voluntary worship, and not propose a reward to the
   worshippers. Wherefore, --

   4. It is evident that God, by the prescription of a worship unto
   sinners, doth fully declare that there is forgiveness with him for
   them; for, --

   (1.) He manifests thereby that he is willing to receive a new revenue
   of glory from them. This, as we have proved, is the end of worship.
   This he would never have done but with a design of accepting and
   rewarding his creatures; for do we think that he will be beholding unto
   them? -- that he will take and admit of their voluntary, reasonable
   service, according to his will and command, without giving them a
   reward, yea, and such a one as their obedience holds no proportion
   unto? No such thing would become his infinite self-sufficiency,
   goodness, and bounty. This the wife of Manoah well pleads, Judges xiii.
   23: "If," saith she, "the Lord were pleased to kill us, he would not
   have received a burnt-offering and a meat-offering at our hands." His
   acceptance of worship from us is an infallible demonstration that he
   will not execute against us the severity of the first curse. And this
   is clearly evidenced in the first record of solemn instituted worship
   performed by sinners: Gen. iv. 4, "The Lord had respect unto Abel and
   to his offering." Some think that God gave a visible pledge of his
   acceptance of Abel and his offering. It may be it was by fire from
   heaven; for how else should Cain so instantly know that his brother and
   his offering were accepted, but that he and his were refused? However
   it were, it is evident that what testimony God gave of the acceptance
   of his offering, the same he gave concerning his person; and that in
   the first place he had respect unto Abel, and then to his offering. And
   therefore the apostle saith that thereby "he obtained witness that he
   was righteous," Heb. xi. 4, -- that is, the witness or testimony of God
   himself. Now, this was in the forgiveness of his sins, without which he
   could neither be righteous nor accepted, for he was a sinner. This God
   declared by acceptance of his worship. And thus we also, if we have any
   testimony of God's acceptance of us in any part of his worship, should
   employ it to the same end. Hath God enlarged our hearts in prayer? hath
   he given us an answer unto any of our supplications? hath he refreshed
   our hearts in the preaching and dispensation of the word, or any other
   ordinance? We are not to rest in the particular about which our
   communion with him hath been; -- our doing so is the cause why we lose
   our experiences; they lie scattered up and down, separated from their
   proper root, and so are easily lost: but this is that which we should
   first improve such particular experiences in the worship of God unto,
   -- namely, that God hath pardoned our sins, and accepted our persons
   thereon; for without that, none of our worship or service would please
   him or be accepted with him.

   (2.) Hereby God lets us know that he deals with us upon new terms, so
   that, notwithstanding sin, we may enjoy his love and favour. For this
   we have the engagement of his truth and veracity, and he cannot deceive
   us. But yet by this command of his for his worship we should be
   deceived, if there were no forgiveness with him; for it gives us
   encouragement to expect, and assurance of finding, acceptance with him,
   which without it cannot be obtained. This, then, God declares by his
   institution of and command for his worship, -- namely, that there is
   nothing that shall indispensably hinder those who give up themselves
   unto obedience of God's commands from enjoying his love and favour, and
   communion with him.

   (3.) For matter of fact, it is known and confessed that God hath
   appointed a worship for sinners to perform. All the institutions of the
   Old and New Testament bear witness hereunto. God was the author of
   them. And men know not what they do when either they neglect them or
   would be intermixing their own imaginations with them. What can the
   mind of man conceive or invent that may have any influence into this
   matter, to secure the souls of believers of their acceptance with God?
   Is there any need of their testimony to the truth, faithfulness, and
   goodness of God? These things he hath taken upon himself. This, then,
   is that which is to be fixed on our souls upon our first invitation
   unto religious worship, -- namely, that God intends a new revenue of
   glory from us, and therefore declares that there is a way for the
   taking away of our sins, without which we can give no glory to him by
   our obedience; and this is done only by forgiveness.

   5. There are some ordinances of worship appointed for this very end and
   purpose, to confirm unto us the forgiveness of sin, especially in that
   worship which is instituted by the Lord Jesus under the New Testament.
   I shall instance in one or two --

   (1.) The ordinance of baptism. This was accompanied with the dawning of
   the gospel in the ministry of John the Baptist; and he expressly
   declared, in his sermons upon it, that it was instituted of God to
   declare the "remission of sins," Mark i. 4.

   It is true the Lord Christ submitted unto that ordinance and was
   baptized by John, who had no sin; but this belonged unto the obedience
   which God required of him, as for our salves he was made under the law.
   He was to observe all ordinances and institutions of the worship of
   God, not for any need he had in his own person of the especial ends and
   significations of some of them; yet, as he was our sponsor, surety, and
   mediator, standing in our stead in all that he so did, he was to yield
   obedience unto them, that so he might "fulfil all righteousness," Matt.
   iii. 15. So was he circumcised, so he was baptized, both which had
   respect unto sin, though absolutely free from all sin in his own
   person; and that because he was free from no obedience unto any command
   of God.

   But, as was said, baptism itself, as appointed to be an ordinance of
   worship for sinners to observe, was a declaration of that forgiveness
   that is with God. It was so in its first institution. God calls a man
   in a marvellous and miraculous manner; gives him a ministry from
   heaven; commands him to go and baptize all those who, confessing their
   sins, and professing repentance of them, should come to him to have a
   testimony of forgiveness. And as to the especial nature of this
   ordinance, he appoints it to be such as to represent the certainty and
   truth of his grace in pardon unto their senses by a visible pledge. He
   lets them know that he would take away their sin, wherein their
   spiritual defilement doth consist, even as water takes away the outward
   filth of the body; and that hereby they shall be saved, as surely as
   Noah and his family were saved in the ark swimming upon the waters, 1
   Pet. iii. 21. Now, how great a deceit must needs in this whole matter
   have been put upon poor sinners, if it were not infallibly certain that
   they might obtain forgiveness with God!

   After the entrance of this ordinance in the ministry of John, the Lord
   Christ takes it into his own hand, and commands the observation of it
   unto all his disciples. I dispute not now who are the proper immediate
   objects of it; whether they only who actually can make profession of
   their faith, or believers with their infant seed. For my part, I
   believe that all whom Christ loves and pardons are to be made partakers
   of the pledge thereof. And the sole reason which they of old insisted
   on why the infants of believing parents should not be baptized was,
   because they thought they had no sin; and therein we know their
   mistake. But I treat not now of these things. Only this I say is
   certain, that in the prescription of this ordinance unto his church,
   the great intention of the Lord Christ was to ascertain unto us the
   forgiveness of sins. And sinners are invited to a participation of this
   ordinance for that end, that they may receive the pardon of their sins;
   that is, an infallible pledge and assurance of it, Acts ii. 38. And the
   very nature of it declareth this to be its end, as was before
   intimated. This is another engagement of the truth, and faithfulness,
   and holiness of God, so that we cannot be deceived in this matter.
   "There is," saith God, "forgiveness with me." Saith the soul, "How,
   Lord, shall I know, how shall I come to be assured of it? for by reason
   of the perpetual accusations of conscience, and the curse of the law
   upon the guilt of my sin, I find it a very hard matter for me to
   believe. Like Gideon, I would have a token of it." "Why, behold," saith
   God, "I will give thee a pledge and a token of it, which cannot deceive
   thee. When the world of old had been overwhelmed with a deluge of
   waters by reason of their sins, and those who remained, though they had
   just cause to fear that the same judgment would again befall them or
   their posterity, because they saw there was like to be the same cause
   of it, the thoughts and imaginations of the hearts of men being evil
   still, and that continually; to secure them against these fears, I told
   them that I would destroy the earth no more with water, and I gave them
   a token of my faithfulness therein by placing my bow in the cloud. And
   have I failed them? Though the sin and wickedness of the world hath
   been, since that day, unspeakably great, yet mankind is not drowned
   again, nor ever shall be. I will not deceive their expectation from the
   token I have given them. Wherever, then, there is a word of promise
   confirmed with a token, never fear a disappointment. But so is this
   matter. I have declared that there is forgiveness with me; and, to give
   you assurance thereof, I have ordained this pledge and sign as a seal
   of my word, to take away all doubts and suspicion of your being
   deceived. As the world shall be drowned no more, so neither shall they
   who believe come short of forgiveness."

   And this is the use which we ought to make of this ordinance. It is
   God's security of the pardon of our sins, which we may safely rest in.

   (2.) The same is the end of that other great ordinance of the church,
   the supper of the Lord. The same thing is therein confirmed unto us by
   another sign, pledge, token, or seal. We have shown before what respect
   gospel forgiveness hath unto the death or blood of Jesus Christ. That
   is the means whereby for us it is procured, the way whereby it comes
   forth from God, unto the glory of his righteousness and grace; which
   afterward must be more distinctly insisted on. This ordinance,
   therefore, designed and appointed on purpose for the representation and
   calling to remembrance of the death of Christ, with the communication
   of the benefits thereof unto them that believe, doth principally intend
   our faith and comfort in the truth under consideration. And, therefore,
   in the very institution of it, besides the general end before
   mentioned, which had been sufficient for our security, there is
   moreover added an especial mention of the forgiveness of sin; for so
   speaks our Saviour, in the institution of it for the use of the church
   unto the end of the world: Matt. xxvi. 28, "This is my blood of the new
   testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins." As if he
   had said, "The end for which I have appointed the observance of this
   duty and service unto you is, that I may testify thereby unto you that
   by my blood, the sacrifice of myself, and the atonement made thereby, I
   have purchased for you the remission of your sins; which you shall
   assuredly be made partakers of." And more I shall not add unto this
   consideration, because the death of Christ, respected in this
   ordinance, will again occur unto us.

   (3.) What is the end of all church-order, assemblies, and worship? What
   is a church? Is it not a company of sinners gathered together,
   according unto God's appointment, to give glory and praise to him for
   pardoning grace, for the forgiveness of sins, and to yield him that
   obedience which he requires from us on the account of his having so
   dealt with us? This is the nature, this is the end of a church. He that
   understandeth it not, he that useth it not unto that end, doth but
   abuse that great institution. And such abuse the world is full of. Some
   endeavour to make their own secular advantages by the pretence of the
   church; some discharge the duty required in it with some secret hopes
   that it shall be their righteousness before God; some answer only their
   light and convictions in an empty profession. This alone is the true
   end, the true use of it -- We assemble ourselves to learn that there is
   forgiveness with God through Christ; to pray that we may be made
   partakers of it; to bless and praise God for our interest in it; to
   engage ourselves unto that obedience which be requires upon the account
   of it. And were this constantly upon our minds and in our designs, we
   might be more established in the faith of it than, it may be, the most
   of us are.

   6. One particular instance more of this nature shall conclude this
   evidence -- God hath commanded us, the Lord Christ hath taught us, to
   pray for the pardon of sin; which gives us unquestionable security that
   it may be attained, that it is to be found in God. For the clearing
   whereof observe, --

   (1.) That the Lord Christ, in the revelation of the will of God unto
   us, as unto the duty that he required at our hands, hath taught and
   instructed us to pray for the forgiveness of sin. It is one of the
   petitions which he hath left on record for our use and imitation in
   that summary of all prayer which he hath given us: Matt. vi. 12,
   "Forgive us our debts," our trespasses, our sins. Some contend that
   this is a form of prayer to be used in the prescript limited words of
   it. All grant that it is a rule for prayer, comprising the heads of all
   necessary things that we are to pray for, and obliging us to make
   supplications for them. So, then, upon the authority of God, revealed
   unto us by Jesus Christ, we are bound in duty to pray for pardon of
   sins or forgiveness.

   (2.) On this supposition it is the highest blasphemy and reproach of
   God imaginable, to conceive that there is not forgiveness with him for
   us. Indeed, if we should go upon our own heads, without his warranty
   and authority, to ask any thing at his hand, we might well expect to
   meet with disappointment; for what should encourage us unto any such
   boldness? but now, when God himself shall command us to come and ask
   any thing from him, -- so making it thereby our duty, and that the
   neglect thereof should be our great sin and rebellion against him, --
   to suppose he hath not the thing in his power to bestow on us, or that
   his will is wholly averse from so doing, is to reproach him with want
   of truth, faithfulness, and holiness, and not to be God. For what
   sincerity can be in such proceedings? Is it consistent with any divine
   excellency? Could it have any other end but to deceive poor creatures?
   either to delude them if they do pray according to his command, or to
   involve them in farther guilt if they do not? God forbid any such
   thoughts should enter into our hearts. But, --

   (3.) To put this whole matter out of the question, God hath promised to
   hear our prayers, and in particular those which we make unto him for
   the forgiveness of sin. So our Saviour hath assured us that what we ask
   in his name it shall be done for us. And he hath, as we have showed,
   taught us to ask this very thing of God as our heavenly Father, -- that
   is, in his name; for in and through him alone is he a Father unto us. I
   need not insist on particular promises to this purpose; they are, as
   you know, multiplied in the Scriptures.

   What hath been spoken may suffice to establish our present argument, --
   namely, that God's prescription of religious worship unto sinners doth
   undeniably prove that with him there is forgiveness; especially
   considering that the principal parts of the worship so prescribed and
   appointed by him are peculiarly designed to confirm us in the faith
   thereof.

   And this is the design of the words that we do insist upon: "There is
   forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared." The fear of God, as
   we have showed, in the Old Testament, doth frequently express, not that
   gracious affection of our minds which is distinctly so called, but that
   whole worship of God, wherein that and all other gracious affections
   towards God are to be exercised. Now, the psalmist tells us that the
   foundation of this fear or worship, and the only motive and
   encouragement for sinners to engage in it and give up themselves unto
   it, is this, that there is forgiveness with God. Without this no sinner
   could fear, serve, or worship him. This, therefore, is undeniably
   proved by the institution of this worship, which was proposed unto
   confirmation.

   The end of all these things, as we shall afterward at large declare, is
   to encourage poor sinners to believe, and to evidence how inexcusable
   they will be left who, notwithstanding all this, do, through the power
   of their lusts and unbelief, refuse to come to God in Christ that they
   may be pardoned. Yea, the laying open of the certainty and fulness of
   the evidence given unto this truth makes it plain and conspicuous
   whence it is that men perish in and for their sins. Is it for want of
   mercy, goodness, grace, or patience in God? Is it through any defect in
   the mediation of the Lord Christ? Is it for want of the mightiest
   encouragements and most infallible assurances that with God there is
   forgiveness? Not at all; but merely on the account of their own
   obstinacy, stubbornness, and perverseness. They will not come unto this
   light, yea, they hate it, because their deeds are evil. They will not
   come to Christ, that they may have life. It is merely darkness,
   blindness, and love of sin that brings men to destruction. And this is
   laid open, and all pretences and excuses are removed, and the shame of
   men's lusts made naked, by the full confirmation of this truth which
   God hath furnished us withal.

   Take heed, you that hear or read these things; if they are not mixed
   with faith, they will add greatly to your misery. Every argument will
   be your torment. But these considerations must be insisted on
   afterward.

   Moreover, if you will take into your minds what hath been delivered in
   particular concerning the nature and end of the worship of God which
   you attend unto, you may he instructed in the use and due observation
   of it. When you address yourselves unto it, remember that this is that
   which God requires of you who are sinners; that this he would not have
   done but with thoughts and intention of mercy for sinners. Bless him
   with all your souls that this is laid as the foundation of all that you
   have to do with him. You are not utterly cast off because you are
   sinners. Let this support and warm your hearts when you go to hear, to
   pray, or any duty of worship. Consider what is your principal work in
   the whole. You are going to deal with God about forgiveness, in the
   being, causes, consequents, and effects of it. Hearken what he speaks,
   declares, or reveals about it; mix his revelation and promises with
   faith. Inquire diligently into all the obedience and thankfulness, all
   those duties of holiness and righteousness, which he justly expects
   from them who are made partakers of it. So shall you observe the
   worship of God unto his glory and your own advantage.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The giving and establishing of the new covenant another evidence of
   forgiveness with God -- The oath of God engaged in the confirmation
   thereof.

   VIII. Another evidence hereof may be taken from the making,
   establishing, and ratifying of the new covenant. That God would make a
   new covenant with his people is often promised, often declared: see,
   among other places, Jer. xxxi. 31, 32. And that he hath done so
   accordingly the apostle at large doth manifest, Heb. viii. 8-12. Now,
   herein sundry things unto our present purpose may be considered; for,
   --

   First, It is supposed that God had before made another covenant with
   mankind. With reference hereunto is this said to be a new one. It is
   opposed unto another that was before it, and in comparison whereof that
   is called old and this said to be new, as the apostle speaks expressly
   in the place before mentioned. Now, a covenant between God and man is a
   thing great and marvellous, whether we consider the nature of it or the
   ends of it. In its own nature it is a convention, compact, and
   agreement for some certain ends and purposes between the holy Creator
   and his poor creatures. How infinite, how unspeakable must needs the
   grace and condescension of God in this matter be! For what is poor
   miserable man, that God should set his heart upon him, -- that he
   should, as it were, give bounds to his sovereignty over him, and enter
   into terms of agreement with him? For whereas before he was a mere
   object of his absolute dominion, made at his will and for his pleasure,
   and on the same reasons to be crushed at any time into nothing; now he
   hath a bottom and ground given him to stand upon, whereon to expect
   good things from God upon the account of his faithfulness and
   righteousness. God in a covenant gives those holy properties of his
   nature unto his creature, as his hand or arm for him to lay hold upon,
   and by them to plead and argue with him. And without this a man could
   have no foundation for any intercourse or communion with God, or of any
   expectation from him, nor any direction how to deal with him in any of
   his concernments. Great and signal, then, was the condescension of God,
   to take his poor creature into covenant with himself; and especially
   will this be manifest if we consider the ends of it, and why it is that
   God thus deals with man. Now, these are no other than that man might
   serve him aright, be blessed by him, and be brought unto the
   everlasting enjoyment of him; -- all unto his glory. These are the ends
   of every covenant that God takes us into with himself; and these are"
   the whole of man," [Eccles. xii. 13.] No more is required of us in a
   way of duty, no more can be required by us to make us blessed and
   happy, but what is contained in them. That we might live to God, be
   accepted with him, and come to the eternal fruition of him, is the
   whole of man, all that we were made for or are capable of; and these
   are the ends of every covenant that God makes with men, being all
   comprised in that solemn word, that "he will be their God, and they
   shall be his people."

   Secondly, This being the nature, this the end of a covenant, there must
   be some great and important cause to change, alter, and abrogate a
   covenant once made and established, -- to lay aside one covenant and to
   enter into another. And yet this the apostle says expressly that God
   had done, Heb. viii. 13, and proves it, because himself calls that
   which he promised a new covenant: which undeniably confirms two things;
   -- first, That the other was become old; and, secondly, That being
   become so, it was changed, altered, and removed. I know the apostle
   speaks immediately of the old administration of the covenant under the
   Old Testament of Mosaical institutions; but he doth so with reference
   unto that revival which in it was given to the first covenant made with
   Adam: for in the giving of the law, and the curse wherewith it was
   accompanied, which were immixed with that administration of the
   covenant, there was a solemn revival and representation of the first
   covenant and its sanction, whereby it had life and power given it to
   keep the people in bondage all their days. And the end of the
   abolition, or taking away of the legal administration of the covenant,
   was merely to take out of God's dealing with his people all use and
   remembrance of the first covenant. As was said, therefore, to take
   away, disannul, and change a covenant so made, ratified, and
   established betwixt God and man, is a matter that must be resolved into
   some cogent, important, and indispensable cause. And this will the more
   evidently appear if we consider, --

   1. In general, that the first covenant was good, holy, righteous, and
   equal. It was such as became God to make, and was every way the
   happiness of the creature to accept of. We need no other argument to
   prove it holy and good than this, that God made it. It was the effect
   of infinite holiness, wisdom, righteousness, goodness, and grace; and
   therefore in itself was it every way perfect, for so are all the works
   of God. Besides, it was such as man, when through his own fault he
   cannot obtain any good by it, and must perish everlastingly by virtue
   of the curse of it, yet cannot but subscribe unto its righteousness and
   holiness. The law was the rule of it; therein is the tenor of it
   contained. Now, saith the apostle, "Whatever becomes of the sin and the
   sinner, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, and just, and
   good,'?" Rom. vii. 12; -- holy in itself and its own nature, as being
   the order and constitution of the most holy God; just and equal with
   reference unto us, such as we have no reason to complain of, or repine
   against the authority of; and the terms of it are most righteous. And
   not only so, but it is good also; that which, notwithstanding the
   appearance of rigour and severity which it is accompanied withal, had
   in it an exceeding mixture of goodness and grace, both in the obedience
   constituted in it and the reward annexed unto it; as might be more
   fully manifested were that our present work.

   2. In particular, [First], It was good, holy, and righteous in all the
   commands of it, in the obedience which it required.

   And two things there were that rendered it exceeding righteous in
   reference unto its precepts or commands. First, That they were all
   suited unto the principles of the nature of man created by God, and in
   the regular acting whereof consisted his perfection. God in the first
   covenant required nothing of man, prescribed nothing unto him, but what
   there was a principle for the doing and accomplishing of it ingrafted
   and implanted on his nature, which rendered all those commands equal,
   holy, and good; for what need any man complain of that which requires
   nothing of him but what he is from his own frame and principles
   inclined unto? Secondly, All the commands of it were proportionate unto
   the strength and ability of them to whom they were given. God in that
   covenant required nothing of any man but what he had before enabled him
   to perform, nothing above his strength or beyond his power; and thence
   was it also righteous.

   Secondly, It was exceeding good, holy, and righteous, upon the account
   of its promises and rewards. "Do this," saith the covenant; "this which
   thou art able to do, which the principles of thy nature are fitted for
   and inclined unto." Well, what shall be the issue thereof? Why, "Do
   this, and live." Life is promised unto obedience, and that such a life
   as, both for the present and future condition of the creature, was
   accompanied with every thing that was needful to make it blessed and
   happy. Yea, this life having in it the eternal enjoyment of God, God
   himself, as a reward, was exceedingly above whatever the obedience of
   man could require as due, or have any reason, on any other account but
   merely of the goodness of God, to expect.

   3. There was provision in that covenant for the preservation and
   manifestation of the glory of God, whatever was the event on the part
   of man. This was provided for in the wisdom and righteousness of God.
   Did man continue in his obedience, and fulfil the terms of the
   covenant, all things were laid in subserviency to the eternal glory of
   God in his reward. Herein would he for ever have manifested and exalted
   the glory of his holiness, power, faithfulness, righteousness, and
   goodness. As an almighty Creator and Preserver, as a faithful God and
   righteous Rewarder, would he have been glorified. On supposition, on
   the other side, that man by sin and rebellion should transgress the
   terms and tenor of this covenant, yet God had made provision that no
   detriment unto his glory should ensue thereon; for by the constitution
   of a punishment proportionable in his justice unto that sin and
   demerit, he had provided that the glory of his holiness, righteousness,
   and veracity, in his threatenings, should be exalted, and that to all
   eternity. God would have lost no more glory and honour by the sin of
   man than by the sin of angels, which, in his infinite wisdom and
   righteousness, is become a great theatre of his eternal glory; for he
   is no less excellent in his greatness and severity than in his goodness
   and power.

   Wherefore, we may now return unto our former inquiry: All things being
   thus excellently and admirably disposed, in infinite wisdom and
   holiness, in this covenant, the whole duty and blessedness of man being
   fully provided for, and the glory of God absolutely secured upon all
   events, what was the reason that God left not all things to stand or
   fall according to the terms of it? wherefore doth he reject and lay
   aside this covenant, and promise to make another, and do so
   accordingly? Certain it is that he might have continued it with a
   blessed security to his own glory; and he "makes all things for
   himself, even the wicked for the day of evil."

   God himself shows what was the only and sole reason of this
   dispensation, Heb. viii. 7-13. The sum of it is this:-- Notwithstanding
   the blessed constitution of the first covenant, yet there was no
   provision for the pardon of sin, no room or place for forgiveness in
   it; but on supposition that man sinned, he was in that covenant left
   remediless. God had not in it revealed that there was any such thing as
   forgiveness with him; nor had any sinner the least hope or grounds of
   expectation from thence of any such thing in him. Die he must, and
   perish, and that without remedy or recovery. "Now," saith God, "this
   must not be. Mercy, goodness, grace, require another state of things
   This covenant will not manifest them; their effects will not be
   communicated to poor sinners by it. Hence," saith he, "it is faulty,
   that is, defective. I will not lose the glory of them, nor shall
   sinners be unrelieved by them. And, therefore, although I may strictly
   tie up all mankind unto the terms of this, yet I will make all other
   covenant with them, wherein they shall know and find that there is
   forgiveness with me, that they may fear me."

   Now, next to the blood of Christ, whereby this covenant was ratified
   and confirmed, this is the greatest evidence that can possibly be given
   that there is forgiveness with God. To what end else doth God make this
   great alteration in the effects of his will, in his way of dealing with
   mankind? As forgiveness of sin is expressly contained in the tenor and
   words of the covenant, so set it aside, and it will be of no more use
   or advantage than the former; for as this covenant is made directly
   with sinners, nor was there any one in the world when God made it that
   was not a sinner, nor is it of use unto any but sinners, so is
   forgiveness of sins the very life of it.

   Hence we may see two things; -- first, The greatness of forgiveness,
   that we may learn to value it; and, secondly, The certainty of it, that
   we may learn to believe it.

   First, The greatness of it. God would not do so great a thing as that
   mentioned but for a great, the greatest end. Had it not been a matter
   of the greatest importance unto the glory of God and the good of the
   souls of men, God would not for the sake of it have laid aside one
   covenant and made another. We may evidently see how the heart of God
   was set upon it, how his nature and will were engaged in it. All this
   was done that we might be pardoned. The old glorious fabric of
   obedience and rewards shall be taken down to the ground, that a new one
   may be erected for the honour and glory of forgiveness. God forbid that
   we should have slight thoughts of that which was so strangely and
   wonderfully brought forth, wherein God had as it were embarked his
   great glory! Shall all this be done for our sakes, and shall we
   undervalue it or disesteem it? God forbid. God could, if I may so say,
   more easily have made a new world of innocent creatures, and have
   governed them by the old covenant, than have established this new one
   for the salvation of poor sinners; but then, where had been the glory
   of forgiveness? It could never have been known that there was
   forgiveness with him. The old covenant could not have been preserved
   and sinners pardoned. Wherefore, God chose rather to leave the covenant
   than sinners unrelieved, than grace unexalted and pardon unexercised.
   Prize it as you prize your souls; and give glory unto God for it, as
   all those that believe will do unto eternity.

   Secondly, For the security of it, that we may believe it. What greater
   can be given? God deceiveth no man, no more than he is deceived. And
   what could God, that cannot lie, do more to give us satisfaction herein
   than he hath done? Would you be made partakers of this forgiveness? --
   go unto God, spread before him this whole matter; plead with him that
   he himself hath so far laid aside the first covenant, of his own
   gracious will, as to make a new one, and that merely because it had no
   forgiveness in it. This he hath made on purpose that it might be known
   that there is forgiveness in him. And shall not we now be made
   partakers of it? will he now deny that unto us which he hath given such
   assurance of, and raised such expectations concerning it? Nothing can
   here wrong us, nothing can ruin us, but unbelief. Lay hold on this
   covenant, and we shall have pardon. This God expresseth, Isa. xxvii. 4,
   5. Will we continue on the old bottom of the first covenant? All that
   we can do thereon is but to set thorns and briers in the way of God, to
   secure ourselves from his coming against us and upon us with his
   indignation and fury. Our sins are so, and our righteousness is no
   better. And what will be the issue? Both they and we shall be trodden
   down, consumed, and burnt up. What way, then, what remedy is left unto
   us? Only this of laying hold on the arm and strength of God in that
   covenant wherein forgiveness of sin is provided. Therein alone he
   saith, "Fury is not in me." And the end will be that we shall have
   peace with him, both here and for ever.

   IX. The oath of God engaged and interposed in this matter is another
   evidence of the truth insisted on. Now, because this is annexed unto
   the covenant before mentioned, and is its establishment, I shall pass
   it over the more briefly. And in it we may consider, --

   First, The nature of the oath of God. The apostle tells us that "He
   sware by himself;" and he gives this reason of it, "Because he had no
   greater to swear by," Heb. vi. 13. An oath for the confirmation of any
   thing is an invocation of a supreme power that can judge of the truth
   that is spoken, and vindicate the breach of the engagement. This God
   hath none other but himself: "Because he could swear by no greater, he
   sware by himself." Now, this God doth, -- First, By express affirmation
   that he hath so sworn by himself, which was the form of the first
   solemn oath of God: Gen. xxii. 16, "By myself have I sworn, saith the
   Lord." The meaning whereof is, "I have taken it upon myself as I am
   God; or let me not be so, if I perform not this thing." And this is
   expressed by his soul: Jer. li. 14, "The Lord of hosts hath sworn by
   his soul;" that is, "by himself," as we render the words. Secondly, God
   doth it by the especial interposition of some such property of his
   nature as is suited to give credit and confirmation to the word spoken;
   -- as of his holiness, Ps. lxxxix. 35, "I have sworn by my holiness;"
   so also Amos iv. 2; -- sometimes by his life, "As I live, saith the
   Lord" (chy'ny?, "I live, saith God"), "it shall be so;" -- and
   sometimes by his name, Jer. xliv. 26. God as it were engageth the
   honour and glory of the properties of his nature for the certain
   accomplishment of the things mentioned. And this is evident from the
   manner of the expression, as in that place of Ps. lxxxix. 35, "Once
   have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David." So we; in
   the original the words are elliptical: "If I lie unto David;" that is,
   "Let me not be so, nor be esteemed to be so, if I lie unto David."

   Secondly, For the end of his oath. God doth not give it to make his
   word or promise sure and steadfast, but to give assurance and security
   unto us of their accomplishment. Every word of God is sure and certain,
   truth itself, because it is his; and he might justly require of us the
   belief of it without any farther attestation: but yet, knowing what
   great objections Satan and our own unbelieving hearts will raise
   against him promises, at least as to our own concernment in them, to
   confirm our minds, and to take away all pretences of unbelief, he
   interposeth his oath in this matter. What can remain of distrust in
   such a case? If there be a matter in doubt between men, and an oath be
   interposed in the confirmation of that which is called in question, it
   is "an end," as the apostle tells us, "unto them of all strife," Heb.
   vi. 16. How much more ought it to be so on the part of God, when his
   oath is engaged! And the apostle declares this end of his oath; it is
   "to show the immutability of his counsel," verse 17. His counsel was
   declared before in the promise; but now some doubt or strife may arise
   whether, on one occasion or other, God may not change his counsel, or
   whether he hath not changed it with such conditions as to render it
   useless unto us. In what case soever it be, to remove all doubts and
   suspicions of this nature, God adds his oath, manifesting the
   unquestionable immutability of his counsel and promises. What,
   therefore, is thus confirmed is ascertained unto the height of what any
   thing is capable of; and not to believe it is the height of impiety.

   Thirdly, In this interposition of God by an oath there is unspeakable
   condescension of grace, which is both an exceeding great motive unto
   faith and a great aggravation of unbelief; for what are we, that the
   holy and blessed God should thus condescend unto us, as, for our
   satisfaction and surety, to engage himself by an oath? One said well of
   old, "Felices nos quorum causÃ¢ Deus jurat! O infelices, si nec juranti
   Deo credimus;" -- "It is an inestimable advantage that God should for
   our sakes engage himself by his oath. So it will be our misery if we
   believe him not when he swears unto us." What can we now object against
   what is thus confirmed? what pretence, colour, or excuse can we have
   for our unbelief? How just, how righteous, how holy must their
   destruction be, who, upon this strange, wonderful, and unexpected
   warranty, refuse to set to their seal that God is true!

   These things being premised, we may consider how variously God hath
   engaged his oath that there is forgiveness with him. First, He sweareth
   that he hath no pleasure in the death of a sinner, but rather that he
   repent and live: Ezek. xxxiii. 11, "As I live, saith the Lord, I have
   no pleasure in the death of the wicked." Now, without forgiveness in
   him every sinner must die, and that without remedy. Confirming,
   therefore, with his oath that it is his will the sinner should return,
   repent, and live, he doth in the first place swear by himself that
   there is forgiveness with him for these sinners that shall so repent
   and turn unto him.

   Again: whereas the great means he hath appointed for the forgiveness of
   sins is by the mediation of the Lord Christ, as we shall afterward
   show, he hath on several occasions confirmed his purpose in him, and
   the counsel of his will, by his oath. By this oath be promised him unto
   Abraham and David of old; which proved the foundation of the church's
   stability in all generations, and also of their security and assurance
   of acceptance with him. See Luke i. 73-75. And in his taking upon him
   that office whereby in an especial manner the forgiveness of sins was
   to be procured, -- namely, of his being a priest to offer sacrifice, to
   make an atonement for sinners, -- he confirmed it unto him, and him in
   it, by his oath: Heb. vii. 20, "He was not made a priest without an
   oath." And to what end? -- namely, that he might be "a surety of a
   better testament," verse 22. And what was that better testament? Why,
   that which brought along with it the "forgiveness of sins," chap. viii.
   12, 13. So that it was forgiveness which was so confirmed by the oath
   of God. Farther: the apostle shows that the great original promise made
   unto Abraham being confirmed by the oath of God, all his other promises
   were in like manner confirmed; whence he draws that blessed conclusion
   which we have, chap. vi. 17, 18: "As to every one," saith he, "that
   flees for refuge to the hope that is set before him," -- that is, who
   seeks to escape the guilt of sin, the curse and the sentence of the
   law, by an application of himself unto God in Christ for pardon, -- "he
   hath the oath of God to secure him that he shall not fall thereof." And
   thus are all the concernments of the forgiveness of sin testified unto
   by the oath of God; which we have manifested to be the highest security
   in this matter that God can give or that we are capable of.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The name of God confirming the truth and reality of forgiveness with
   him -- As also the same is done by the properties of his nature.

   X. Another foundation of this truth, and infallible evidence of it, may
   be taken from that especial name and title which God takes unto himself
   in this matter; for he owns the name of "The God of pardons," or "The
   God of forgiveness." So is he called, Neh. ix. 17, ?'lvh slchvt?. We
   have rendered the words, "Thou art a God ready to pardon;" but they
   are, as was said, "Thou art a God of pardons," "forgiveness," or"
   propitiations." That is his name, which he owneth, which he accepteth
   of the ascription of unto himself; the name whereby he will be known.
   And to clear this evidence, we must take in some considerations of the
   name of God and the use thereof; as, --

   1. The name of God is that whereby he reveals himself unto us, whereby
   he would have us know him and own him. It is something expressive of
   his nature or properties which he hath appropriated unto himself.
   Whatever, therefore, any name of God expresseth him to he, that he is,
   that we may expect to find him; for he will not deceive us by giving
   himself a wrong or a false name. And on this account he requires us to
   trust in his name, because he will assuredly be found unto us what his
   name imports. Resting on his name, flying unto his name, calling upon
   his name, praising his name, things so often mentioned in the
   Scripture, confirm the same unto us. These things could not be our duty
   if we might he deceived in so doing. God is, then, and will be, to us
   what his name declareth.

   2. On this ground and reason God is said then first to be known by any
   name, when those to whom he reveals himself do, in an especial manner,
   rest on that name by faith, and have that accomplished towards them
   which that name imports, signifies, or declares. And therefore God did
   not, under the Old Testament, reveal himself to any by the name of the
   Father of Jesus Christ or the Son incarnate, because the grace of it
   unto them was not to be accomplished. "God having provided some better
   thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect," they
   were not intrusted with the full revelation of God by all his blessed
   names. Neither doth God call us to trust in any name of his, however
   declared or revealed, unless he gives it us in an especial manner, by
   way of covenant, to rest upon. So he speaks, Exod. vi. 3, "I appeared
   unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob v'l sdy?, by the name of God
   Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known unto them." It is
   certain that both these names of God, El-shaddai and Jehovah, were
   known among his people before. In the first mention we have of
   Abraham's addressing himself unto the worship of God, he makes use of
   the name Jehovah: Gen. xii. 7, "He builded an altar unto Jehovah." And
   so afterward not only doth Moses make use of that name in the
   repetition of the story, but it was also of frequent use amongst them.
   Whence, then, is it said that God appeared unto them by the name of
   El-shaddai, but not by the name of Jehovah? The reason is, because that
   was the name which God gave himself in the solemn confirmation of the
   covenant with Abraham: chap. xvii. 1, 'ny'l sdy?, -- "I am El-shaddai,"
   "God Almighty," "God All-sufficient." And when Isaac would pray for the
   blessing of the covenant on Jacob, he makes use of that name: chap.
   xxviii. 3, "God Almighty bless thee." He invocates that name of God
   which was engaged in the covenant made with his father Abraham and
   himself. That, therefore, we may with full assurance rest on the name
   of God, it is not only necessary that God reveal that name to be his,
   but also that he give it out unto us for that end and purpose, that we
   might know him thereby, and place our trust and confidence in him
   according unto what that name of his imports. And this was the case
   wherever he revealed himself unto any in a peculiar manner by an
   especial name. So he did unto Jacob: chap. xxviii. 13, "I am the Lord
   God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac;" assuring him, that as
   he dealt faithfully in his covenant with his fathers, Abraham and
   Isaac, so also he would deal with him. And, chap. xxxi. 13, "I am the
   God of Bethel," -- "He who appeared unto thee there, and blessed thee,
   and will continue so to do." But when the same Jacob comes to ask after
   another name of God, he answers him not; as it were commanding him to
   live by faith on what he was pleased to reveal. Now, then, God had not
   made himself known to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob by his name
   Jehovah, because he had not peculiarly called himself unto them by that
   name, nor had engaged it in his covenant with them, although it were
   otherwise known unto them. They lived and rested on the name of God
   Almighty, as suited to their supportment and consolation in their
   wandering, helpless condition, before the promise was to be
   accomplished. But now, when God came to fulfil his promises, and to
   bring the people, by virtue of his covenant, into the land of Canaan,
   he reveals himself unto them by, and renews his covenant with them in,
   the name of Jehovah. And hereby did God declare that he came to give
   stability and accomplishment unto his promises; to which end they were
   now to live upon this name of Jehovah, in an expectation of the
   fulfilling of the promises, as their fathers did on that of God
   Almighty, in an expectation of protection from him in their wandering
   state and condition. Hence this name became the foundation of the
   Judaical church, and ground of the faith of them who did sincerely
   believe in God therein. And it is strangely fallen out, in the
   providence of God, that since the Jews have rejected the covenant of
   their fathers, and are cast out of the covenant for their unbelief,
   they have utterly forgot that name of God. No Jew in the world knows
   what it is, nor how to pronounce it or make mention of it. I know
   themselves and others pretend strange mysteries in the letters and
   vowels of that name, which make it ineffable; but the truth is, being
   cast out of that covenant which was built and established on that name,
   in the just judgment of God, through their own blindness and
   superstition, they are no more able to make mention of it or to take it
   into their mouths. It is required, then, that the name of God be given
   unto us as engaged in covenant, to secure our expectation that he will
   be unto us according to his name.

   3. All the whole gracious name of God, every title that he hath given
   himself, every ascription of honour unto himself that he hath owned, is
   confirmed unto us (unto as many as believe) in Jesus Christ. For as he
   hath declared unto us the whole name of God, John xvii. 6, so not this
   or that promise of God, but all the promises of God are in him yea and
   amen. So that, as of old, every particular promise that God made unto
   the people served especially for the particular occasion on which it
   was given, and each name of God was to be rested on as to that
   dispensation whereunto it was suited to give relief and confidence, --
   as the name of El-shaddai to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the name
   Jehovah to Moses and the people; so now, by Jesus Christ, and in him,
   every particular promise belongs unto all believers in all their
   occasions, and every name of God whatever is theirs also, at all times,
   to rest upon and put their trust in. Thus, the particular promise made
   unto Joshua, at his entrance into Canaan, to encourage and strengthen
   him in that great enterprise of conquering the land, is by the apostle
   applied unto all believers in all their occasions whatever: "I will
   never leave thee, nor forsake thee," Heb. xiii. 5. So likewise doth
   every name of God belong now unto us, as if it had in a particular
   manner been engaged in covenant unto us, and that because the whole
   covenant is ratified and confirmed unto us by Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. vi.
   18, vii. 1. This, then, absolutely secures unto us an interest in the
   name of God insisted on, the God of forgiveness, as if it had been
   given unto every one of us to assure us thereof.

   4. God takes this name, "The God of forgiveness," to be his in a
   peculiar manner, as that whereby he will be distinguished and known. He
   appropriates it to himself, as expressing that which the power and
   goodness of no other can extend unto. "There are lords many, and gods
   many," saith the apostle, 1 Cor. viii 5, -- legomenoi theoiÂ· some that
   are called so, such as some account so to be. How is the true God
   distinguished from these gods by reputation? He is so by this name; he
   is the God of pardons: Micah vii. 18, "Who is a God like unto thee,
   that pardoneth iniquity?" This is his prerogative; herein none is equal
   to him, like him, or a sharer with him. "Who is a God like unto thee,
   that may be called a God of pardons?" The vanities of the nations
   cannot give them this rain; they have no refreshing showers of mercy
   and pardon in their power. Neither angels, nor saints, nor images, nor
   popes, can pardon sin. By this name doth he distinguish himself from
   them all.

   5. To be known by this name is the great glory of God in this world.
   When Moses desired to see the glory of God, the Lord tells him that "he
   could not see his face," Exod. xxxiii. 18-20. The face of God, or the
   gracious majesty of his Being, his essential glory, is not to be seen
   of any in this life; we cannot see him as he is. But the glorious
   manifestation of himself we may behold and contemplate. This we may see
   as the back parts of God; that shadow of his excellencies which he
   casteth forth in the passing by us in his works and dispensations. This
   Moses shall see. And wherein did it consist? Why, in the revelation and
   declaration of this name of God: chap. xxxiv. 6, 7, "The Lord passed by
   before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and
   gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping
   mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin." To
   be known by this name, to be honoured, feared, believed as that
   declares him, is the great glory of God. And shall this fail us? Can we
   be deceived trusting in it, or expecting that we shall find him to be
   what his name declares? God forbid.

   Let us lay together these considerations, and we shall find that they
   will give us another stable foundation of the truth insisted on, and a
   great encouragement to poor sinful souls to draw nigh to God in Christ
   for pardon. God hath no name but what he gives unto himself; nor is it
   lawful to know him or call him otherwise. As he calls himself, so is
   he; what his name imports, so is his nature. Every name also of God is
   engaged in Jesus Christ in the covenant, and is proposed unto us to
   place our trust and confidence in. Now, this is his name and his
   memorial, even "The God of forgiveness." By this he distinguisheth
   himself from all others, and expresseth it as the principal title of
   his honour, or his peculiar glory. According to this name, therefore,
   all that believe shall assuredly find "there is forgiveness with him."

   XI. The consideration of the essential properties of the nature of God,
   and what is required to the manifestation of them, will afford us
   farther assurance hereof. Let us to this end take in the ensuing
   observations:--

   First, God being absolutely perfect and absolutely self-sufficient, was
   eternally glorious, and satisfied with and in his own holy excellencies
   and perfections, before and without the creation of all or any thing by
   the putting forth or the exercise of his almighty power. The making,
   therefore, of all things depends on a mere sovereign act of the will
   and pleasure of God. So the whole creation makes its acknowledgment:
   Rev. iv. 11, v. 12, "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and
   honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy
   pleasure they are and were created." God could have omitted all this
   great work without the least impeachment of his glory. Not one holy
   property of his nature would have been diminished or abated in its
   eternal glory by that omission. This, then, depended on a pure act of
   his will and choice.

   Secondly, On supposition that God would work "ad extra," by his power
   produce any thing without himself, it was absolutely necessary that
   himself should be the end of his so doing. For as before the production
   of all things, there was nothing that could be the end why any of them
   should be brought forth out of nothing, or towards which they should be
   disposed; so God, being an infinite agent in wisdom, and understanding,
   and power, he could have no end in his actings but that also which is
   infinite. It is therefore natural and necessary unto God to do all
   things for himself. It is impossible he should have any other end. And
   he hath done so accordingly: Prov. xvi. 4, "The Lord) hath made all
   things for himself." He aimed at himself in all that he did; there
   being no other infinite good for him to make his object and his end but
   himself alone.

   Thirdly, This doing things, all things for himself, cannot intend an
   addition or accruement thereby of any new real good unto himself. His
   absolute eternal perfection and all-sufficiency render this impossible.
   God doth not become more powerful, great, wise, just, holy, good, or
   gracious, by any of his works, by any thing that he doth. He can add
   nothing to himself. It must therefore be the manifestation and
   declaration of the holy properties of his nature that he doth intend
   and design in his works, And there are two things required hereunto:--

   1. That he make them known; that by ways suited to his infinite wisdom
   he both declare that such properties do belong unto him, as also what
   is the nature of them, according as the creature is able to apprehend.

   So he doth things "to make his power known," to show his power, and to
   declare his name through the earth, Rom. ix. 17, 22. So it was said
   that by the works of creation, to gnoston tou Theou, "that which may be
   known of God is manifest," Rom. i. 19, 20. And what is that? Even the
   natural, essential properties of his being, "his eternal power and
   Godhead." To this head are referred all those promises of God that he
   would glorify himself, and the prayers of his saints that he would do
   so, and the attestations given unto it in the Scripture that he hath
   done so. He hath made known his wisdom, holiness, power, goodness,
   self-sufficiency, and the like perfections of his nature.

   2. That he attain an ascription, an attribution of praise and glory to
   himself upon their account. His design is "to be admired in all them
   that believe," 2 Thess. i. 10; -- that is, that upon an apprehension of
   his excellencies which he hath revealed, and as he hath revealed them,
   they should admire, adore, applaud, glorify, and praise him; worship,
   believe in, and trust him in all things; and endeavour the enjoyment of
   him as an eternal reward. And this is also threefold:--

   (1.) Interpretative. So the inanimate and brute creatures ascribe unto
   God the glory of his properties, even by what they are and do. By what
   they are in their beings, and their observation of the law and
   inclination of their nature, they give unto God the glory of that
   wisdom and power whereby they are made, and of that sovereignty whereon
   they depend. Hence, nothing more frequent in the praises of God of old,
   than the calling of the inanimate creatures, heaven and earth, winds,
   storms, thunder, and the beasts of the field, to give praise and glory
   to God; that is, by what they are they do so, inasmuch as from the
   impression of God's glorious excellencies in their effects upon them,
   they are made known and manifest.

   (2.) Involuntary, in some rational creatures. Sinning men and angels
   have no design, no will, no desire to give glory to God. They do their
   utmost endeavour to the contrary, to hate him, reproach and blaspheme
   him. But they cannot yet cast off the yoke of God. In their minds and
   consciences they are forced, and shall be for ever, to acknowledge that
   God is infinitely holy, infinitely wise, powerful, and righteous. And
   he hath the glory of all these properties from them in their very
   desires that he were otherwise. When they would that God were not just
   to punish them, powerful to torment them, wise to find them out, holy
   to be displeased with their lusts and sins, they do at the same time,
   in the same thing, own, acknowledge, and give unto God the glory of his
   being, justice, wisdom, power, and holiness. When, therefore, God hath
   made known his properties, the ascription of glory unto him on their
   account is to rational creatures natural and unavoidable.

   (3.) It is voluntary, in the reasonable service, worship, fear, trust,
   obedience of angels and men. God having revealed unto them the
   properties of his nature, they acknowledge, adore them, and place their
   confidence in them, and thereby glorify him as God. And this glorifying
   of God consisteth in three things:--

   [1.] In making the excellencies of God revealed unto us the principle
   and chief object of all the moral actings of our souls, and of all the
   actings of our affections To fear the Lord and his goodness, and to
   fear him for his goodness; to trust in his power and faithfulness; to
   obey his authority; to delight in his will and grace; to love him above
   all, because of his excellencies and beauty; -- this is to glorify him.

   [2.] To pray for, and to rejoice in, the ways and means whereby he will
   or hath promised farther to manifest or declare these properties of his
   nature and his glory in them. What is the reason why we pray for, long
   for, the accomplishment of the promises of God toward his mints, of his
   threatenings towards his enemies, of the fulfilling of the glorious
   works of his power and grace that yet remain to be done, of the coming
   of the kingdom of Christ, of the approach of glory? Is it not chiefly
   and principally that the glorious excellencies of God's nature may be
   made more manifest, be more known, more exalted, -- that God may appear
   more as he is, and as he hath declared himself to be? This is to give
   glory to God. So likewise our joy, rejoicing, and satisfaction in any
   of the ways and works of God; it is solely on this account, that in
   them, God in his properties, -- that is, his power, wisdom, holiness,
   and the like, -- is revealed, declared, and made known.

   [3.] In their joint actual celebration of his praises; which, as it is
   a duty of the greatest importance, and which we are, indeed, of all
   others most frequently exhorted unto and most earnestly called upon
   for; so in the nature of it, it consists in our believing, rejoicing
   expression of what God is and what he doth; -- that is, our admiring,
   adoring, and blessing him, because of his holiness, goodness, and the
   rest of his properties, and his works of grace and power suitable unto
   them. This it is to praise God, Rev. v.

   Fourthly, Observe that none of these properties of God can be thus
   manifested and known, nor himself be glorified for them, but by his
   declaration of them, and by their effects. We know no more of God than
   he is pleased to reveal unto us. I mean not mere revelation by his
   word, but any ways or means, whether by his word, or by his works, or
   by impressions from the law of nature upon our hearts and minds. And
   whatever God thus declares of himself, he doth it by exercising,
   putting forth, and manifesting the effects of it. So we know his power,
   wisdom, goodness, and grace, -- namely, by the effects of them, or the
   works of God that proceed from them and are suited unto them. And
   whatever is in God that is not thus made known, we cannot apprehend,
   nor glorify God on the account of it. God, therefore, doing all things,
   as hath been showed, for the glory of these his properties, he doth so
   reveal them and make them known.

   Fifthly, Upon this design of God, it is necessary that he should reveal
   and make known all the attributes and properties of his nature, in
   works and effects peculiarly proceeding from them and answering unto
   them, that he might be glorified in them; and which, as the event
   manifests, he hath done accordingly. For what reason can be imagined
   why God will be glorified in one essential excellency of his nature and
   not in another? Especially must this be affirmed of those properties of
   the nature of God which the event manifesteth his principal glory to
   consist in and arise from, and the knowledge whereof is of the greatest
   use, behoof, and benefit unto the children of men, in reference unto
   his design towards them.

   Sixthly, These things being so, let us consider how it stands in
   reference unto that which is under consideration. God, in the creation
   of all things, glorified or manifested his greatness, power, wisdom,
   and goodness, with many other properties of the like kind. But his
   sovereignty, righteousness, and holiness, how are they declared hereby?
   Either not at all, or not in so evident a manner as is necessary, that
   he might be fully glorified in them or for them. What, then, doth he
   do? leave them in darkness, vailed, undiscovered, satisfying himself in
   the glory of those properties which his work of creation had made
   known? Was there any reason why he should do so, designing to do all
   things for himself and for his own glory? Wherefore he gives his holy
   law as a rule of obedience unto men and angels. This plainly reveals
   his sovereignty or authority over them, his holiness and righteousness
   in the equity and purity of things he required of them: so that in and
   by these properties also he may be glorified. As he made all things for
   himself, -- that is, the manifestation of his greatness, power, wisdom,
   and goodness; so he gave the law for himself, -- that is, the
   manifestation of his authority, holiness, and righteousness. But is
   this all? Is there not remunerative justice in God, in a way of bounty?
   Is there not vindictive justice in him, in a way of severity? There is
   so; and in the pursuit of the design mentioned they also are to be
   manifested, or God will not be glorified in them. This, therefore, he
   did also, in the rewards and punishments that he annexed unto the law
   of obedience that he had prescribed. To manifest his remunerative
   justice, he promised a reward in a way of bounty, which the angels that
   sinned not were made partakers of; and in the penalty threatened, which
   sinning angels and men incurred, he revealed his vindictive justice in
   a way of severity. So are all these properties of God made known by
   their effects, and so is God glorified in them or on their account.

   But, after all this, are there no other properties of his nature,
   divine excellencies that cannot be separated from his being, which by
   none of these means are so much as once intimated to be in him? It is
   evident that there are; such are mercy, grace, patience,
   long-suffering, compassion, and the like. Concerning which observe, --

   1. That where there are no objects of them, they cannot be declared, or
   manifested, or exercised. As God's power or wisdom could not be
   manifest if there were no objects of them, no more can his grace or
   mercy. If never any stand in need of them, they can never be exercised,
   and consequently never be known. Therefore were they not revealed,
   neither by the creation of all things, nor by the law or its sanction,
   nor by the law written in our hearts; for all these suppose no objects
   of grace and mercy. For it is sinners only, and such as have made
   themselves miserable by sin, that they can be exercised about.

   2. There are no excellencies of God's nature that are more expressive
   of divine goodness, loveliness, and beauty than these are, -- of mercy,
   grace, long-suffering, and patience; and, therefore, there is nothing
   that God so requireth our likeness unto him, in our conformity unto his
   image, as in these, -- namely, mercy, grace, and readiness to forgive.
   And the contrary frame in any he doth of all things most abhor: "They
   shall have judgment without mercy, who shewed no mercy." And,
   therefore, it is certain that God will be glorified in the
   manifestation of these properties of his nature.

   3. These properties can be no otherwise exercised, and consequently no
   otherwise known, but only in and by the pardon of sin; which puts it
   beyond all question that there is forgiveness with God. God will not
   lose the glory of these his excellencies: he will be revealed in them,
   he will be known by them, he will be glorified for them; which he could
   not be if there were not forgiveness with him. So that here comes in
   not only the truth but the necessity of forgiveness also.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Forgiveness manifested in the sending of the Son of God to die for sin
   -- And from the obligation that is on us to forgive one another.

   XII. In the next place we shall proceed unto that evidence which is the
   centre wherein all the lines of those foregoing do meet and rest, --
   the fountain of all those streams of refreshment that are in them, --
   that which animates and gives life and efficacy unto them. This lies in
   God's sending of his Son. The consideration hereof will leave no
   pretence or excuse unto unbelief in this matter.

   To make this evidence more clear and legible, as to what is intended in
   it, we must consider, -- First, What was the rise of this sending we
   speak of. Secondly, Who it was that was sent. Thirdly, How, or in what
   manner he was sent. Fourthly, Unto what end and purpose.

   First, The rise and spring of it is to be considered. It came forth
   from the eternal mutual consent and counsel of the Father and the Son:
   Zech. vi. 13, "The counsel of peace shall be between them both." It is
   of Christ, the Branch, of whom he speaks. "lie shall build the temple
   of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon
   his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel
   of peace shall be between them both;" -- that is, between God the
   Father, who sends him, and himself. There lay the counsel of
   peace-making between God and man, in due time accomplished by him who
   is "our peace," Eph. ii. 14: so he speaks, Prov. viii. 30, 31, "Then I
   was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight,
   rejoicing always before him; rejoicing in the habitable part of his
   earth; and my delights were with the sons of men." They are the words
   of the Wisdom, that is, of the Son of God. When was this done? "Then I
   was by him." Why, "before the mountains were settled, while as yet he
   had not made the earth, nor the fields;" that is, before the creation
   of the world, or from eternity, verses 25, 26. But how then could he
   "rejoice in the habitable part of the earth?" and how could his
   "delights be with the sons of men," seeing as yet they were not? I
   answer, It was the counsel of peace towards them before mentioned, in
   the pursuit whereof he was to be sent to converse amongst them on the
   earth. He rejoiced in the fore-thoughts of his being sent to them, and
   the work he had to do for them. Then, with his own consent and delight,
   was he "fore-ordained" unto his work, even "before the foundation of
   the world," 1 Pet. i. 20, and received of the Father "the promise of
   eternal life, even before the world began," Tit. i. 2; that is, to be
   given unto sinners by way of forgiveness through his blood. So is this
   whole counsel expressed, Ps. xl. 7, 8, -- whence it is made use of by
   the apostle, Heb. x. 5-7, -- "Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of
   the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God. Thy
   law is in the midst of my heart." There is the will of the Father in
   this matter, and the law of its performance; and there is the will of
   the Son in answer thereunto, and his delight in fulfilling that law
   which was prescribed unto him.

   Let us now consider to what purpose was this eternal counsel of peace,
   this agreement of the Father and Son from eternity, about the state and
   condition of mankind. If God would have left them all to perish under
   the guilt of their sins, there had been no need at all of any such
   thoughts, design, or counsel. God had given unto them a law righteous
   and holy, which if they transgressed, he had threatened them with
   eternal destruction. Under the rule, disposal, and power of this law,
   he might have righteously left them to stand or fall, according to the
   verdict and sentence thereof. But now he assures us, he reveals unto
   us, that he had other thoughts in this matter; that there were other
   counsels between the Father and the Son concerning us; and these such
   as the Son was delighted in the prospect of his accomplishment of them.
   What can these thoughts and counsels be, but about a way for their
   deliverance? which could no otherwise be but by the forgiveness of
   sins; for whatever else be done, yet if God mark iniquities, there is
   none can stand. Hearken, therefore, poor sinner, and have hope. God is
   consulting about thy deliverance and freedom. And what cannot the
   wisdom and grace of the Father and Son effect and accomplish? And to
   this end was the Son sent into the world; which is the second thing
   proposed to consideration.

   Secondly, Whom did God send about this business? The Scripture lays
   great weight and emphasis on this consideration, faith must do so also:
   John iii. 16, "God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten
   Son;" so, 1 John iv. 9, "In this was manifested the love of God towards
   us, because that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we
   might live through him." And again, verse 10, "Herein is love, not that
   we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the
   propitiation for our sins." And who is this that is thus sent, and
   called the only-begotten Son of God? Take a double description of him,
   one out of the Old Testament and another from the New; -- the first
   from Isa. ix. 6, "Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and
   the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
   Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
   Prince of Peace;" the other from Heb. i. 2, 3, "God hath spoken unto us
   by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he
   made the worlds; who being the brightness of his glory, and the express
   image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power,
   when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of
   the Majesty on high." This is he who was sent. In nature he was
   glorious, even "over all, God blessed for ever;" -- in answerableness
   unto the Father, "the brightness of his glory, and the express image of
   his person," possessed of all the same essential properties with him,
   so that what we find in him we may be assured of in the Father also;
   for he that hath seen him hath seen the Father, who is in him; -- in
   power omnipotent, for he made all things, and "upholding all things,"
   with an unspeakable facility, "by the word of his power;" -- in office
   exalted over all, sitting "on the right hand of the Majesty on high;"
   -- in name, "The mighty God, The everlasting Father" so that whatever
   he came about he will assuredly accomplish and fulfil; for what should
   hinder or let this mighty one from perfecting his design?

   Now, this consideration raiseth our evidence to that height as to give
   an unquestionable assurance in this matter. Here is a near and a
   particular object for faith to be exercised about and to rest in.
   Wherefore did this glorious Son of God come and tabernacle amongst poor
   sinners? "We beheld the glory of the eternal Word, the glory of the
   only-begotten of the Father, and he was made flesh (kai eskenose), and
   pitched his tabernacle amongst us," John i. 14. To what end? It was no
   other but to work out and accomplish the eternal counsel of peace
   towards sinners before mentioned; to procure for them, and to declare
   unto them, the forgiveness of sin. And what greater evidence, what
   greater assurance can we have, that there is forgiveness with God for
   us? He himself hath given it as a rule, that what is done by giving an
   only-begotten or an only-beloved son gives assured testimony of reality
   and sincerity in the thing that is confirmed by it. So he says unto
   Abraham, Gen. xxii. 12, "Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing that
   thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me." This way it
   may be known, or no way. And they are blessed conclusions that faith
   may make from this consideration: "Now I know that there is forgiveness
   with God, seeing he hath not withheld his Son, his only Son, that he
   might accomplish it." To this purpose the apostle teacheth us to
   reason, Rom. viii. 32, "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered
   him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all
   things?"

   What farther can any soul desire? what ground remains for unbelief to
   stand upon in this matter? Is there any thing more to be done herein?
   It was to manifest that there is forgiveness with him, and to make way
   for the exercise of it, that God sent his Son, that the Son of God came
   into the world, as will afterwards more fully appear.

   Thirdly, To this sending of the Son of God to this purpose, there is
   evidence and security added from the manner wherein he was sent. How
   was this? Not in glow, not in power, -- not in an open discovery of his
   eternal power and Godhead. Had it been so, we might have thought that
   he had come merely to manifest and glorify himself in the world; and
   this he might have done without thoughts of mercy or pardon towards us.
   But he came quite in another manner: he was seen in the "likeness of
   sinful flesh," Rom. viii. 3; in "the form of a servant," Phil. ii. 7;
   being "made of a woman, made under the law," Gal. iv. 4. What he
   endured, suffered, underwent in that state and condition, is in some
   measure known unto us all. All this could not be merely and firstly for
   himself. All that he expected at the close of it was, to be "glorified
   with that glow which he had with the Father before the world was," John
   xvii. 5. It must, then, be for our sakes. And for what? To save and
   deliver us from that condition of wrath at present, and future
   expectation of vengeance, which we had cast ourselves into by sin; that
   is, to procure for us the forgiveness of sin. Had not God designed
   pardon for sin, he would never have sent his Son in this manner to
   testify it; and he did it because it could no other way be brought
   about, as hath been declared. Do we doubt whether there be forgiveness
   with God or no? or whether we shall obtain it if we address ourselves
   unto him for to be made partakers of it? Consider the condition of his
   Son in the world, -- review his afflictions, poverty, temptation,
   sorrows, sufferings, -- then ask our souls, "To what end was all this?"
   And if we can find any other design in it, any other reason, cause, or
   necessity of it, but only and merely to testify and declare that there
   is forgiveness with God, and to purchase and procure the communication
   of it unto us, let us abide in and perish under our fears. But if this
   be so, we have sufficient warranty to assure our souls in the
   expectation of it.

   Fourthly, Besides all this, there ensues upon what went before, that
   great and wonderful issue in the death of the Son of God. This thing
   was great and marvellous, and we may a little inquire into what it was
   that was designed therein. And hereof the Scripture gives us a full
   account; as, --

   1. That he died to make atonement for sin, or "reconciliation for
   iniquity," Dan. ix. 24. He "gave his life a ransom for the sins of
   many," Matt. xx. 28; 1 Tim. ii. 6. He was in it "made sin," that others
   "might be made the righteousness of God in him," 2 Cor. v. 21; Rom.
   viii. 3. Therein he "bare our sins in his own body on the tree," 1 Pet.
   ii. 24. This was the state of this matter -- Notwithstanding all the
   love, grace, and condescension before mentioned, yet our sins were of
   that nature, and so directly opposite unto the justice and holiness of
   God, that unless atonement were made and a price of redemption paid,
   there could be no pardon, no forgiveness obtained. This, therefore, he
   undertook to do, and that by the sacrifice of himself; answering all
   that was prefigured by and represented in the sacrifices of old, as the
   apostle largely declares, Heb. x. 5-10. And herein is the forgiveness
   that is in God copied out and exemplified so clearly and evidently,
   that he that cannot read it will be cursed unto eternity. Yea, and let
   him be accursed; for what can be more required to justify God in his
   eternal destruction? He that will not believe his grace, as testified
   and exemplified in the blood of his Son, let him perish without remedy.
   Yea, but, --

   2. The curse and sentence of the law lies on record against sinners. It
   puts in its demands against our acquittance, and lays an obligation
   upon us unto punishment: and God will not reject nor destroy his law;
   unless it be answered, there is no acceptance for sinners. This,
   therefore, in the next place, his death was designed unto. As he
   satisfied and made atonement by it unto justice (that was the fountain,
   spring, and cause of the law), so he fulfilled and answered the demands
   of the law as it was an effect of the justice of God: so Rom. viii.
   1-4. He suffered "in the likeness of sinful flesh, that the
   righteousness of the law might be fulfilled" and answered. He answered
   "the curse of the law" when he was "made a curse for us," Gal. iii. 13;
   and so became, as to the obedience of the law, "the end of the law for
   righteousness unto them that do believe," Rom. x. 3, 4. And as to the
   penalty that it threatened, he bore it, removed it, and took it out of
   the way. So hath he made way for forgiveness through the very heart of
   the law; it hath not one word to speak against the pardon of them that
   do believe. But, --

   3. Sinners are under the power of Satan. He lays a claim unto them; and
   by what means shall they be rescued from his interest and dominion?
   This also his death was designed to accomplish: for as he was
   "manifested to destroy the works of the devil," 1 John iii. 8, so
   "through death he destroyed him that had the power of death," Heb. ii.
   14; -- that is, to despoil him of his power, to destroy his dominion,
   to take away his plea unto sinners that believe; as we have at large
   elsewhere declared.

   And by all these things, with many other concernments of his death that
   might be instanced in, we are abundantly secured of the forgiveness
   that is with God, and of his willingness that we should be made
   partakers thereof.

   Fifthly, Is this all? Did his work cease in his death? Did he no mere
   for the securing of the forgiveness of sins unto us, but only that he
   died for them? Yes; he lives also after death, for the same end and
   purpose. This Son of God, in that nature which he assumed to expiate
   sin by death, lives again after death, to secure unto us and to
   complete the forgiveness of sins. And this he doth two ways:--

   1. Being raised from that death which he underwent, to make atonement
   for sin, by the power and good will of God, he evidenceth and
   testifieth unto us that he hath fully performed the work he undertook,
   and that in our behalf, and for us, he hath received a discharge. Had
   he not answered the guilt of sin by his death, he had never been raised
   from it.

   2. He lives after death a mediatory life, to make intercession for us,
   that we may receive the forgiveness of sin, as also himself to give it
   out unto us; which things are frequently made use of to encourage the
   souls of men to believe, and therefore shall not at present be farther
   insisted on.

   Thus, then, stands this matter -- That mercy might have a way to
   exercise itself in forgiveness, with a consistency unto the honour of
   the righteousness and law of God, was the Son of God so sent, for the
   ends and purposes mentioned. Now, herein consisteth the greatest work
   that God did ever perform, or ever will. It was the most eminent
   product of infinite wisdom, goodness, grace, and power; and herein do
   all the excellencies of God shine forth more gloriously than in all the
   works of his hands. Let us, then, wisely ponder and consider this
   matter; let us bring our own souls, with their objections, unto this
   evidence, and see what exception we have to lay against it. I know
   nothing will satisfy unbelief. The design of it is, to make the soul
   find that to be so hereafter which it would persuade it of here, --
   namely, that there is no forgiveness in God. And Satan, who makes use
   of this engine, knows full well that there is none for them who believe
   there is none, or rather will not believe that there is any; for it
   will, at the last day, be unto men according unto their faith or
   unbelief. He that believeth aright, and he that believeth not that
   forgiveness is with God, as to their own particulars, shall neither of
   them be deceived. But what is it that can be reasonably excepted
   against this evidence, this foundation of our faith in this matter? God
   hath not sent his Son in vain; which yet he must have done, as we have
   showed, had he not designed to manifest and exercise forgiveness
   towards sinners. Wherefore, to confirm our faith from hence, let us
   make a little search into these things in some particular inquiries --

   1. Seeing the Son of God died in that way and manner that he did,
   according to the determinate counsel and will of God, wherefore did he
   do so, and what aimed he at therein?

   Ans. It is plain that he died for our sins, Rom iv. 25; that is, "to
   make reconciliation for the sins of the people," Heb. ii. 17, 18. This
   Moses and the prophets, this the whole Scripture, testifieth unto. And
   without a supposal of it, not one word of it can be aright believed;
   nor can we yield any due obedience unto God without it.

   2. What, then, did God do unto him? What was in transaction between God
   as the Judge of all, and him that was the Mediator of the church?

   Ans. God indeed "laid on him the iniquity of us all," Isa. liii. 6, --
   all the sins of all the elect; yea, he made him "a curse for us," Gal.
   iii. 13; and making him a "sin-offering," or "an offering for sin," he
   "condemned sin in the flesh," Rom. viii. 3, 2 Cor. v. 21: so that all
   that which the justice or law of God had to require about the
   punishment due unto sin was all laid and executed on him.

   3. What, then, did Christ do in his death? What did he aim at and
   design? what was his intention in submitting unto and undergoing the
   will of God in these things?

   Ans. "He bare our sins in his own body on the tree," 1 Pet. ii. 24; "he
   took our sins upon him," undertook to answer for them, to pay our
   debts, to make an end of the difference about them between God and
   sinners, Dan. ix. 24. His aim undoubtedly was, by all that he underwent
   and suffered, so to make atonement for sin as that no more could on
   that account be expected.

   4. Had God any more to require of sinners on the account of sin, that
   his justice might be satisfied, his holiness vindicated, his glory
   exalted, his honour be repaired, than what he charged on Christ? Did he
   lay somewhat of the penalty due to sin on him, execute some part of the
   curse of the law against him, and yet reserve some wrath for sinners
   themselves?

   Ans. No, doubtless. He came to do the whole will of God, Heb. x. 7, 9;
   and God spared him not any thing that in his holy will he had appointed
   to be done unto sin, Rom. viii. 32. He would never have so dealt with
   his Son, to have made a half-work of it; nor is the work of making
   satisfaction for sin such as that any, the least part of it, should
   ever be undertaken by another. Nothing is more injurious or blasphemous
   against God and Christ than the foolish imagination among the Papists
   of works satisfactory for the punishment due to sin or any part of it;
   as also is their purgatory pains to expiate any remaining guilt after
   this life. This work of making satisfaction for sin is such as no
   creature in heaven or earth can put forth a hand unto. It was wholly
   committed to the Son of God, who alone was able to undertake it, and
   who hath perfectly accomplished it; so that God now says," Fury is not
   in me.' lie that will lay hold on my strength that he may have peace,
   he shall have peace," Isa. xxvii. 4, 5.

   5. What, then, became of the Lord Christ in his undertaking? Did he go
   through with it? or did he faint under it? Did he only testify his
   love, and show his good will for our deliverance? or did he also
   effectually pursue it, and not faint, until he had made a way for the
   exercise of forgiveness?

   Ans. It was not possible that he should be detained by "the pains of
   death," Acts ii. 24. He knew beforehand that he should be carried
   through his work, that he should not be forsaken in it, nor faint under
   it, Isa. l. 5-9. And God hath given this unquestionable evidence of his
   discharge of the debt of sin to the utmost, in that he was acquitted
   from the whole account when he was raised from the dead; for he that is
   given up to prison, upon the sentence of the law, for the debt of sin,
   shall not be freed until he have paid the utmost farthing. This,
   therefore, he manifested himself to have done, by his resurrection from
   the dead.

   6. What, then, is now become of him? where is he, and what doth he?
   Hath he so done his work and laid it aside, or doth he still continue
   to carry it on until it be brought unto its perfection?

   Ans. It is true, he was dead, but he is alive, and lives for ever; and
   hath told us that "because he liveth we shall live also," and that
   because this is the end of his mediatory life in heaven: "He ever
   liveth to make intercession for us," Heb. vii. 25-27; and to this end,
   that the forgiveness of sin, which he hath procured for us, may be
   communicated unto us, that we might be partakers of it, and live for
   ever.

   What ground is left of questioning the truth in hand? What link of this
   chain can unbelief break in or upon? If men resolve, notwithstanding
   all this evidence and assurance that is tendered unto them thereof,
   that they will not yet believe that there is forgiveness with God, or
   will not be encouraged to attempt the securing of it unto themselves,
   or also despise it as a thing not worth the looking after; it is enough
   for them that declare it, that preach these things, that they are a
   sweet savour unto God in them that perish as well as in them that are
   saved. And I bless God that I have had this opportunity to bear
   testimony to the grace of God in Christ; which if it be not received,
   it is because "the god of this world hath blinded the eyes of men, that
   the light of the gospel of the glory of God should not shine into their
   minds." But Christ will be glorified in them that believe on these
   principles and foundations.

   XIII. Another evidence of the same truth may be taken from hence, that
   God requires forgiveness in us, that we should forgive one another; and
   therefore, doubtless, there is forgiveness with him for us. The sense
   of this consideration unto our present purpose will be manifest in the
   ensuing observations:--

   First, It is certain that God hath required this of us. The testimonies
   hereof are many and known, so that they need not particularly to be
   repeated or insisted on: see Luke xvii. 3, 4; Eph. iv. 32; Matt. xviii.
   23, unto the end. Only, there are some things that put a singular
   emphasis upon this command, manifesting the great importance of this
   duty in us, which may be marked; as, --

   1. That our Saviour requires us to carry a sense of our integrity and
   sincerity in the discharge of this duty along with us in our addresses
   unto God in prayer. Hence, he teacheth and enjoins us to pray or plead
   for the forgiveness of our debts to God (that is, our sins or
   trespasses against him, which make us debtors to his law and justice),
   even "as we forgive them that so trespass against us" as to stand in
   need of our forgiveness, Matt. vi. 12. Many are ready to devour such as
   are not satisfied that the words of that rule of prayer which he hath
   prescribed unto us are to be precisely read or repeated every day. I
   wish they would as heedfully mind that prescription which is given us
   herein for that frame of heart and spirit which ought to be in all our
   supplications; it might possibly abate of their wrath in that and other
   things. But here is a rule for all prayer, as all acknowledge; as also
   of the things that are requisite to make it acceptable. This, in
   particular, is required, that before the Searcher of all hearts, and in
   our addresses unto him, in our greatest concernments, we profess our
   sincerity in the discharge of this duty, and do put our obtaining of
   what we desire upon that issue. This is a great crown that is put upon
   the head of this duty, that which makes it very eminent, and evidenceth
   the great concern of the glory of God and our own souls therein.

   2. We may observe, that no other duty whatever is expressly placed in
   the same series, order, or rank with it; which makes it evident that it
   is singled out to be professed as a token and pledge of our sincerity
   in all other parts of our obedience unto God. It is by Christ himself
   made the instance for the trial of our sincerity in our universal
   obedience; which gives no small honour unto it. The apostle puts great
   weight on the fifth commandment, "Honour thy father and mother;"
   because it "is the first commandment with promise," Eph. vi. 2. All the
   commandments, indeed, had a promise, "Do this, and live," life was
   promised to the observance of them all; but this is the first that had
   a peculiar promise annexed unto it, and accompanying of it. And it was
   such a promise as had a peculiar foundation through God's ordinance in
   the thing itself. It is, that the parents should prolong the lives of
   their children that were obedient. y'rkvn ymyk?, Exod. xx. 12, -- "They
   shall prolong thy days;" that is, by praying for their prosperity,
   blessing them in the name of God, and directing them in those ways of
   obedience whereby they might live and possess the land. And this
   promise is now translated from the covenant of Canaan into the covenant
   of grace; the blessing of parents going far towards the interesting
   their children in the promise thereof, and so prolonging their days
   unto eternity, though their days in this world should be of little
   continuance. So it is said of our Saviour that "he should see his seed,
   and prolong his days," Isa. liii. 10; which hath carried over that
   word, and that which is signified by it, unto eternal things. But this
   by the way. As the singular promise made to that command renders it
   singular, so doth this especial instancing in this duty in our prayer
   render it also; for though, as all the commandments had a promise, so
   we are to carry a testimony with us of our sincerity in universal
   obedience in our addresses unto God, yet the singling out of this
   instance renders it exceeding remarkable, and shows what a value God
   puts upon it, and how well he is pleased with it.

   3. That God requires this forgiveness in us upon the account of the
   forgiveness we receive from him; which is to put the greatest
   obligation upon us unto it that we are capable of, and to give the
   strongest and most powerful motive possible unto its performance. See
   Eph. iv. 32.

   4. That this duty is more directly and expressly required in the New
   Testament than in the Old. Required then it was, but not so openly, so
   plainly, so expressly as now. Hence we find a different frame of spirit
   between them under that dispensation and those under that of the New
   Testament. There are found amongst them some such reflections upon
   their enemies, their oppressors, persecutors, and the like, as although
   they were warranted by some actings of the Spirit of God in them, yet,
   being suited unto the dispensation they were under, do no way become us
   now, who, by Jesus Christ, receive "grace for grace." So Zechariah,
   when he died, cried, "The Lord look upon, and require;" but Stephen,
   dying in the same cause and manner, said, "Lord, lay not this sin to
   their charge." Elijah called for fire from heaven; but our Saviour
   reproves the least inclination in his disciples to imitate him therein.
   And the reason of this difference is, because forgiveness in God is
   under the New Testament far more clearly (especially in the nature and
   cause of it) discovered in the gospel, which hath brought life and
   immortality to light, than it was under the law; for all our obedience,
   both in matter and manner, is to be suited unto the discoveries and
   revelation of God unto us.

   5. This forgiveness of others is made an express condition of our
   obtaining pardon and forgiveness from God, Matt. vi. 14, 15; and the
   nature hereof is expressly declared, chap. xviii. 23-35. Such
   evangelical conditions we have not many. I confess they have no causal
   influence into the accomplishment of the promise; but the
   non-performance of them is a sufficient bar against our pretending to
   the promise, a sufficient evidence that we have no pleadable interest
   in it. Our forgiving of others will not procure forgiveness for
   ourselves; but our not forgiving of others proves that we ourselves are
   not forgiven. And all these things do show what weight God himself lays
   on this duty.

   Secondly, Observe that this duty is such as that there is nothing more
   comely, useful, or honourable unto, or praiseworthy in, any, than a due
   performance of it. To be morose, implacable, inexorable, revengeful, is
   one of the greatest degeneracies of human nature. And no men are
   commonly, even in this world, more branded with real infamy and
   dishonour, amongst wise and good men, than those who are of such a
   frame, and do act accordingly. To remember injuries, to retain a sense
   of wrongs, to watch for opportunities of revenge, to hate and be
   maliciously perverse, is to represent the image of the devil unto the
   world in its proper colours; he is the great enemy and self-avenger. On
   the other side, no grace, no virtue, no duty, no ornament of the mind
   or conversation of man, is in itself so lovely, so comely, so
   praiseworthy, or so useful unto mankind, as are meekness, readiness to
   forgive, and pardon. This is that principally which renders a man a
   good man, for whom one would even dare to die. And I am sorry to add
   that this grace or duty is recommended by its rarity. It is little
   found amongst the children of men. The consideration of the defect of
   men herein, as in those other fundamental duties of the gospel, -- in
   self-denial, readiness for the cross, and forsaking the world, -- is an
   evidence, if not of how little sincerity there is in the world, yet at
   least it is of how little growing and thriving there is amongst
   professors.

   Thirdly, That there is no grace, virtue, or perfection in any man, but
   what is as an emanation from the divine goodness and bounty, so
   expressive of some divine excellencies or perfection, -- somewhat that
   is in God, in a way and manner infinitely more excellent. We were
   created in the image of God. Whatever was good or comely in us was a
   part of that image; especially the ornaments of our minds, the
   perfections of our souls. These things had in them a resemblance of,
   and a correspondency unto, some excellencies in God, whereunto, by the
   way of analogy, they may be reduced. This being, for the most part,
   lost by sin, a shadow of it only remaining in the faculties of our
   souls and that dominion over the creatures which is permitted unto men
   in the patience of God, the recovery that we have by grace is nothing
   but an initial renovation of the image of God in us, Eph. iv. 24. It is
   the implanting upon our natures those graces which may render us again
   like unto him. And nothing is grace or virtue but what so answers to
   somewhat in God. So, then, whatever is in us of this kind is in God
   absolutely, perfectly, in a way and manner infinitely more excellent.

   Let us now, therefore, put these things together -- God requires of us
   that there should be forgiveness in us for those that do offend us,
   forgiveness without limitation and bounds. The grace hereof he
   bestoweth on his saints, sets a high price upon it, and manifests many
   ways that he accounts it among the most excellent of our endowments,
   one of the most lovely and praiseworthy qualifications of any person.
   What, then, shall we now say? is there forgiveness with him or no? "He
   that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall
   he not see?" He that thus prescribes forgiveness to us, that bestows
   the grace of it upon us, is there not forgiveness with him? It is all
   one as to say, "Though we are good, yet God is not; though we are
   benign and bountiful, yet he is not." He that finds this grace wrought
   in him in any measure, and yet fears that he shall not find it in God
   for himself, doth therein and so far prefer himself above God; which is
   the natural effect of cursed unbelief.

   But the truth is, were there not forgiveness with God, forgiveness in
   man would be no virtue, with all these qualities that incline thereto,
   -- such are meekness, pity, patience, compassion, and the like; which
   what were it but to set loose human nature to rage and madness? For as
   every truth consists in its answerableness to the prime and eternal
   Verity, so virtue consists not absolutely nor primarily in a conformity
   to a rule of command, but in a correspondency unto the first absolute
   perfect Being and its perfections.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Properties of forgiveness -- The greatness and freedom of it.

   The arguments and demonstrations foregoing have, we hope, undeniably
   evinced the great truth we have insisted on; which is the life and soul
   of all our hope, profession, religion, and worship. The end of all this
   discourse is to lay a firm foundation for faith to rest upon in its
   addresses unto God for the forgiveness of sins, as also to give
   encouragements unto all sorts of persons so to do. This end remains now
   to be explained and pressed; which work yet before we directly close
   withal, two things are farther to be premised. And the first is, to
   propose some of those adjuncts of, and considerations about, this
   forgiveness, as may both encourage and necessitate us to seek out after
   it; and to mix the testimonies given unto it and the promises of it
   with faith, unto our benefit and advantage. The other is, to show how
   needful all this endeavour is, upon the account of that great unbelief
   which is in the most in this matter. As to the first of these, then, we
   may consider, --

   First, That this forgiveness that is with God is such as becomes him;
   such as is suitable to his greatness, goodness, and all other
   excellencies of his nature; such as that therein he will be known to be
   God. What he says concerning some of the works of his providence, "Be
   still, and know that I am God," may be much more said concerning this
   great effect of his grace. Still your souls, and know that he is God.
   It is not like that narrow, difficult, halving, and manacled
   forgiveness that is found amongst men, when any such thing is found
   amongst them; but it is full, free, boundless, bottomless, absolute,
   such as becomes his nature and excellencies. It is, in a word,
   forgiveness that is with God, and by the exercise whereof he will be
   known so to be. And hence, --

   1. God himself doth really separate and distinguish his forgiveness
   from any thing that our thoughts and imaginations can reach unto; and
   that because it is his, and like himself. It is an object for faith
   alone, which can rest in that which it cannot comprehend. It is never
   safer than when it is, as it were, overwhelmed with infiniteness. But
   set mere rational thoughts or the imaginations of our minds at work
   about such things, and they fall inconceivably short of them. They can
   neither conceive of them aright nor use them unto their proper end and
   purpose. Were not forgiveness in God somewhat beyond what men could
   imagine, no flesh could be saved. This himself expresseth: Isa. lv.
   7-9, "Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
   thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon
   him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. For my thoughts are
   not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For
   as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than
   your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts." They are, as is plain
   in the context, thoughts of forgiveness and ways of pardon whereof he
   speaks. These our apprehensions come short of; we know little or
   nothing of the infinite largeness of his heart in this matter. He that
   he speaks of is rs?, "an impiously wicked man," and 'ys 'vn?, "a man of
   deceit and perverse wickedness;" he whose design and course is nothing
   but a lie, sin, and iniquity; such a one as we would have little or no
   hopes of, -- that we would scarce think it worth our while to deal
   withal about, -- a hopeless conversion; or can scarce find in our
   hearts to pray for him, but are ready to give him up as one profligate
   and desperate. But let him turn to the Lord, and he shall obtain
   forgiveness. But how can this be? is it possible there should be mercy
   for such a one? Yes; for the Lord yrvh lslvch?, "will multiply to
   pardon." He hath forgiveness with him to outdo all the multiplied sins
   of any that turn unto him and seek for it. But this is very hard, very
   difficult for us to apprehend. This is not the way and manner of men.
   We deal not thus with profligate offenders against us. "True," saith
   God; "but your ways are not my ways.' I do not act in this matter like
   unto you, nor as you are accustomed to do." How then shall we apprehend
   it? how shall we conceive of it? "You can never do it by your reason or
   imaginations; for as the heavens are above the earth, so are my
   thoughts,' in this matter, above your thoughts.'?" This is an
   expression to set out the largest and most inconceivable distance that
   may be. The creation will afford no more significant expression or
   representation of it. The heavens are inconceivably distant from the
   earth, and inconceivably glorious above it. So are the thoughts of God:
   they are not only distant from ours, but have a glory in them also that
   we cannot rise up unto. For the most part, when we come to deal with
   God about forgiveness, we hang in every brier of disputing, quarrelsome
   unbelief. This or that circumstance or aggravation, this or that
   unparalleled particular, bereaves us of our confidence. Want of a due
   consideration of him with whom we have to do, measuring him by that
   line of our own imaginations, bringing him down unto our thoughts and
   our ways, is the cause of all our disquietments. Because we find it
   hard to forgive our pence, we think he cannot forgive talents. But he
   hath provided to obviate such thoughts in us: Hos. xi. 9, "I will not
   execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy
   Ephraim: for I am God, and not man." Our satisfaction in this matter is
   to be taken from his nature. Were he a man, or as the sons of men, it
   were impossible that, upon such and so many provocations, he should
   turn away from the fierceness of his anger. But he is God. This gives
   an infiniteness and an inconceivable boundlessness to the forgiveness
   that is with him, and exalts it above all our thoughts and ways. This
   is to be lamented, -- presumption, which turns God into an idol,
   ascribes unto that idol a greater largeness in forgiveness than faith
   is able to rise up unto when it deals with him as a God of infinite
   excellencies and perfections. The reasons of it, I confess, are
   obvious. But this is certain, no presumption can falsely imagine that
   forgiveness to itself from the idol of its heart, as faith may in the
   way of God find in him and obtain from him; for, --

   2. God engageth his infinite excellencies to demonstrate the greatness
   and boundlessness of his forgiveness. He proposeth them unto our
   consideration to convince us that we shall find pardon with him
   suitable and answerable unto them. See Isa. xl. 27-31, "Why sayest
   thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the Lord, and
   my judgment is passed over from my God? Hast thou not known? hast thou
   not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends
   of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of
   his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have
   no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be
   weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: but they that wait upon
   the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
   eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not
   faint." The matter in question is, whether acceptance with God, which
   is only by forgiveness, is to be obtained or no. This, sinful Jacob
   either despairs of, or at least desponds about. But saith God, "My
   thoughts are not as your thoughts" in this matter. And what course doth
   he take to convince them of their mistake therein? what argument doth
   he make use of to free them from their unbelief, and to rebuke their
   fears? Plainly, he calls them to the consideration of himself, both who
   and what he is with whom they had to do, that they might expect
   acceptance and forgiveness such as did become him. Minding them of his
   power, his immensity, his infinite wisdom, his unchangeableness, all
   the excellencies and properties of his nature, he demands of them
   whether they have not just ground to expect forgiveness and grace above
   all their thoughts and apprehensions, because answering the infinite
   largeness of his heart, from whence it doth proceed.

   And Moses manageth this plea for the forgiveness of that people under a
   high provocation, and a most severe threatening of their destruction
   thereon, Numb. xiv. 17, 18. He pleads for pardon in such a way and
   manner as may answer the great and glorious properties of the nature of
   God, and which would manifest an infiniteness of power and
   all-sufficiency to be in him.

   This, I say, is an encouragement in general unto believers. We have, as
   I hope, upon unquestionable grounds, evinced that there is forgiveness
   with God; which is the hinge on which turneth the issue of our eternal
   condition. Now this is like himself; such as becomes him; that answers
   the infinite perfections of his nature; that is exercised and given
   forth by him as God. We are apt to narrow and straiten it by our
   unbelief, and to render it unbecoming of him. He less dishonours God
   (or as little), who, being wholly under the power of the law, believes
   that there is no forgiveness with him, none to be obtained from him, or
   doth not believe it that so it is, or is so to be obtained, -- for
   which he hath the voice and sentence of the law to countenance him, --
   than those who, being convinced of the principles and grounds of it
   before mentioned, and of the truth of the testimony given unto it, do
   yet, by straitening and narrowing of it, render it unworthy of him
   whose excellencies are all infinite, and whose ways on that account are
   incomprehensible. If, then, we resolve to treat with God about this
   matter (which is the business now in hand), let us do it as it becomes
   his greatness; that is, indeed, as the wants of our souls do require.
   Let us not entangle our own spirits by limiting his grace. The father
   of the child possessed with a devil, being in a great agony when he
   came to our Saviour, cries out, "If thou canst do any thing, have
   compassion on us, and help us," Mark ix. 22. He would fain be
   delivered, but the matter was so great that he questioned whether the
   Lord Christ had either compassion or power enough for his relief. And
   what did he obtain hereby? Nothing but the retarding of the cure of his
   child for a season; for our Saviour holds him off until he had
   instructed him in this matter. Saith he, verse 23, "If thou canst
   believe, all things are possible to him that believeth;" -- "Mistake
   not; if thy child be not cured, it is not for want of power or pity in
   me, but of faith in thee. My power is such as renders all things
   possible, so that they be believed." So it is with many who would
   desirously be made partakers of forgiveness. If it be possible, they
   would be pardoned; but they do not see it possible. Why, where is the
   defect? God hath no pardon for them, or such as they are; and so it may
   be they come finally short of pardon. What! because God cannot pardon
   them? -- it is not possible with him? Not at all; but because they
   cannot, they will not believe, that the forgiveness that is with him is
   such as that it would answer all the wants of their souls, because it
   answers the infinite largeness of his heart. And if this doth not
   wholly deprive them of pardon, yet it greatly retards their peace and
   comfort. God doth not take it well to be limited by us in any thing,
   least of all in his grace. This he calls a tempting of him, a provoking
   temptation: Ps. lxxviii. 41, "They turned back and tempted God, and
   limited the Holy One of Israel." This he could not bear with. If there
   be any pardon with God, it is such as becomes him to give. When he
   pardons, he will "abundantly pardon." Go with your half-forgiveness,
   limited, conditional pardons, with reserves and limitations, unto the
   sons of men; it may be it may become them, it is like themselves; --
   that of God is absolute and perfect, before which our sins are as a
   cloud before the east wind and the rising sun. Hence he is said to do
   this work with his whole heart and his whole soul, charizesthai,
   "freely," bountifully, largely to indulge and forgive unto us our sins,
   and "to cast them into the depths of the sea," Micah vii. 19, into a
   bottomless ocean, -- an emblem of infinite mercy. Remember this, poor
   souls, when you are to deal with God in this matter: "All things are
   possible unto them that do believe."

   Secondly, This forgiveness is in or with God, not only so as that we
   may apply ourselves unto it if we will, for which he will not be
   offended with us, but so also as that he hath placed his great glory in
   the declaration and communication of it; nor can we honour him more
   than by coming to him to be made partakers of it, and so to receive it
   from him. For the most part, we are, as it were, ready rather to steal
   forgiveness from God, than to receive from him as one that gives it
   freely and largely. We take it up and lay it down as though we would be
   glad to have it, so God did not, as it were, see us take it; for we are
   afraid he is not willing we should have it indeed. We would steal this
   fire from heaven, and have a share in God's treasures and riches almost
   without his consent: at least, we think that we have it from him
   "Ã¦grÃ¨," with much difficulty; that it is rarely given, and scarcely
   obtained; that he gives it out hekon aekonti ge thumo, with a kind of
   unwilling willingness, -- as we sometimes give alms without
   cheerfulness; and that he loseth so much by us as he giveth out in
   pardon. We are apt to think that we are very willing to have
   forgiveness, but that God is unwilling to bestow it, and that because
   he seems to be a loser by it, and to forego the glory of inflicting
   punishment for our sins; which of all things we suppose he is most
   loath to part withal. And this is the very nature of unbelief. But
   indeed things are quite otherwise. He hath in this matter, through the
   Lord Christ, ordered all things in his dealings with sinners, "to the
   praise of the glory of his grace," Eph. i. 6. His design in the whole
   mystery of the gospel is to make his grace glorious, or to exalt
   pardoning mercy. The great fruit and product of his grace is
   forgiveness of sinners. This God will render himself glorious in and
   by. All the praise, glory, and worship that he designs from any in this
   world is to redound unto him by the way of this grace, as we have
   proved at large before. For this cause spared he the world when sin
   first entered into it; for this cause did he provide a new covenant
   when the old was become unprofitable; for this cause did he send his
   Son into the world. This hath he testified by all the evidences
   insisted on. Would he have lost the praise of his grace, nothing hereof
   would have been done or brought about.

   We can, then, no way so eminently bring or ascribe glory unto God as by
   our receiving forgiveness from him, he being willing thereunto upon the
   account of its tendency unto his own glory, in that way which he hath
   peculiarly fixed on for its manifestation. Hence the apostle exhorts us
   to "come boldly unto the throne of grace," Heb. iv. 16; that is, with
   the confidence of faith, as he expounds "boldness," chap. x. 19-22. We
   come about a business wherewith he is well pleased; such as he delights
   in the doing of, as he expresseth himself, Zeph. iii. 17, "The Lord thy
   God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over
   thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with
   singing." This is the way of God's pardoning; he doth it in a
   rejoicing, triumphant manner, satisfying abundantly his own holy soul
   therein, and resting in his love. We have, then, abundant encouragement
   to draw nigh to the throne of grace, to be made partakers of what God
   is so willing to give out unto us.

   And to this end serves also the oath of God, before insisted on, --
   namely, to root out all the secret reserves of unbelief concerning
   God's unwillingness to give mercy, grace, and pardon unto sinners. See
   Heb. vi. 17, 18, where it is expressed. Therefore, the tendency of our
   former argument is, not merely to prove that there is forgiveness with
   God, which we may believe and not be mistaken, but which we ought to
   believe; it is our duty so to do. We think it our duty to pray, to hear
   the word, to give alms, to love the brethren, and to abstain from sin;
   and if we fall in any of these, we find the guilt of them reflected
   upon our conscience, unto our disquietment: but we scarce think it our
   duty to believe the forgiveness of our sins. It is well, it may be, we
   think, with them that can do it; but we think it not their fault who do
   not. Such persons may be pitied, but, as we suppose, not justly blamed,
   no, not by God himself. Whose conscience almost is burdened with this
   as a sin, that he doth not, as he ought, believe the forgiveness of his
   sins? And this is merely because men judge it not their duty so to do;
   for a non-performance of a duty, apprehended to be such, will reflect
   on the conscience a sense of the guilt of sin. But now what can be
   required to make any thing a duty unto us that is wanting in this
   matter? for, --

   1. There is forgiveness with God, and this manifested, revealed,
   declared. This manifestation of it is that which makes it the object of
   our faith. We believe things to be in God and with him, not merely and
   formally because they are so, but because he hath manifested and
   revealed them so to be, 1 John i. 2. What he so declares it is our duty
   to believe, or we frustrate the end of his revelation.

   2. We are expressly commanded to believe, and that upon the highest
   promises and under the greatest penalties. This command is that which
   makes believing formally a duty. Faith is a grace, as it is freely
   wrought in us by the Holy Ghost; the root of all obedience and duties,
   as it is radically fixed in the heart; but as it is commanded, it is a
   duty. And these commands, you know, are several ways expressed, by
   invitations, exhortations, propositions; which all have in them the
   nature of commands, which take up a great part of the books of the New
   Testament.

   3. It is a duty, as we have showed, of the greatest concernment unto
   the glory of God.

   4. Of the greatest importance unto our souls here and hereafter. And
   these things were necessary to be added, to bottom our ensuing
   exhortations upon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Evidences that most men do not believe forgiveness.

   That which should now ensue is the peculiar improvement of this truth,
   all along aimed at, -- namely, to give exhortations and encouragements
   unto believing; but I can take few steps in this work, wherein methinks
   I do not hear some saying, "Surely all this is needless. Who is there
   that doth not believe all that you go about to prove? and so these
   pains are spent to little or no purpose." I shall, therefore, before I
   persuade any unto it, endeavour to show that they do it not already.
   Many, I say, the most of men who live under the dispensation of the
   gospel, do wofully deceive their own souls in this matter. They do not
   believe what they profess themselves to believe, and what they think
   they believe. Men talk of "fundamental errors;" this is to me the most
   fundamental error that any can fall into, and the most pernicious. It
   is made up of these two parts:-- 1. They do not indeed believe
   forgiveness. 2. They suppose they do believe it, which keeps them from
   seeking after the only remedy. Both these mistakes are in the
   foundation, and do ruin the souls of them that live and die in them. I
   shall, then, by a brief inquiry, put this matter to a trial. By some
   plain rules and principles may this important question, whether we do
   indeed believe forgiveness or no, be answered and decided. But to the
   resolution intended, I shall premise two observations --

   1. Men in this case are very apt to deceive themselves. Self-love, vain
   hopes, liking of lust, common false principles, sloth, unwillingness
   unto self-examination, reputation with the world, and it may be in the
   church, all vigorously concur unto men's self-deceivings in this
   matter. It is no easy thing for a soul to break through all these, and
   all self-reasonings that rise from them, to come unto a clear judgment
   of its own acting in dealing with God about forgiveness. Men also find
   a common presumption of this truth, and its being an easy relief
   against gripings of conscience and disturbing thoughts about sin, which
   they daily meet withal. Aiming, therefore, only at the removal of
   trouble, and finding their present imagination of it sufficient
   thereunto, they never bring their persuasion to the trial

   2. As men are apt to do thus, so they actually do so; they do deceive
   themselves, and know not that they do so. The last day will make this
   evident, if men will no sooner be convinced of their folly. When our
   Saviour told his disciples that one of them twelve should betray him,
   though it were but one of twelve that was in danger, yet every one of
   the twelve made a particular inquiry about himself. I will not say that
   one in each twelve is here mistaken; but I am sure the Truth tells us
   that "many are called, but few are chosen." They are but few who do
   really believe forgiveness. Is it not, then, incumbent on every one to
   be inquiring in what number he is likely to be found at the last day?
   Whilst men put this inquiry off from themselves, and think or say, "It
   may be the concernment of others, it is not mine," they perish, and
   that without remedy. Remember what poor Jacob said when he had lost one
   child, and was afraid of the loss of another: Gen. xliii. 14, "If I be
   bereaved of my children, I am bereaved." As if he should have said, "If
   I lose my children, I have no more to lose; they are my all. Nothing
   worse can befall me in this world. Comfort, joy, yea, life and all, go
   with them." How much more may men say in this case, "If we are deceived
   here, we are deceived; all is lost. Hope, and life, and soul, all must
   perish, and that for ever!" There is no help or relief for them who
   deceive themselves in this matter. They have found out a way to go
   quietly down into the pit.

   Now, these things are premised only that they may be incentives unto
   self-examination in this matter, and so render the ensuing
   considerations useful. Let us, then, address ourselves unto them;:--

   1. In general, This is a gospel truth; yea, the great fundamental and
   most important truth of the gospel. It is the turning-point of the two
   covenants, as God himself declares, Heb. viii. 7-13. Now, a very easy
   consideration of the ways and walkings of men will satisfy us as to
   this inquiry, whether they do indeed believe the gospel, the covenant
   of grace, and the fundamental principles of it. Certainly their
   ignorance, darkness, blindness, their corrupt affections, and worldly
   conversations, their earthly-mindedness, and open disavowing of the
   spirit, ways, and yoke of Christ, speak no such language. Shall we
   think that proud, heady, worldly self-seekers, haters of the people of
   God and his ways, despisers of the Spirit of grace and his work,
   sacrificers to their own lusts, and such like, do believe the covenant
   of grace or remission of sins? God forbid we should entertain any one
   thought of so great dishonour to the gospel! Wherever that is received
   or believed it produceth other effects, Tit. ii. 11, 12; Isa. xi. 6-9.
   It "teacheth men to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts." It
   changeth their hearts, natures, and ways. It is not such a barren,
   impotent, and fruitless thing as such an apprehension would represent
   it.

   2. They that really believe forgiveness in God do thereby obtain
   forgiveness. Believing gives an interest in it; it brings it home to
   the soul concerned. This is the inviolable law of the gospel. Believing
   and forgiveness are inseparably conjoined. Among the evidences that we
   may have of any one being interested in forgiveness, I shall only name
   one, -- they prize and value it above all the world. Let us inquire
   what esteem and valuation many of those have of forgiveness, who put it
   out of all question that they do believe it. Do they look upon it as
   their treasure, their jewel, their pearl of price? Are they solicitous
   about it? Do they often look and examine whether it continues safe in
   their possession or no? Suppose a man have a precious jewel laid up in
   some place in his house; suppose it be unto him as the poor widow's two
   mites, all her substance or living; -- will he not carefully ponder on
   it? will he not frequently satisfy himself that it is safe? We may know
   that such a house, such fields or lands, do not belong unto a man, when
   he passeth By them daily and taketh little or no notice of them. Now,
   how do most men look upon forgiveness? what is their common deportment
   in reference unto it? Are their hearts continually filled with thoughts
   about it? Are they solicitous concerning their interest in it? Do they
   reckon that whilst that is safe all is safe with them? When it is, as
   it were, laid out of the way by sin and unbelief, do they give
   themselves no rest until it be afresh discovered unto them? Is this the
   frame of the most of men? The Lord knows it is not. They talk of
   forgiveness, but esteem it not, prize it not, make no particular
   inquiries after it. They put it to an ungrounded venture whether ever
   they be partakers of it or no. For a relief against some pangs of
   conscience it is called upon, or else scarce thought of at all.

   Let not any so minded flatter themselves that they have any
   acquaintance with the mystery of gospel forgiveness.

   3. Let it be inquired of them who pretend unto this persuasion how they
   came by it, that we may know whether it be of Him who calleth us or no;
   that we may try whether they have broken through the difficulties, in
   the entertaining of it, which we have manifested abundantly to lie in
   the way of it.

   When Peter confessed our Saviour to be "the Christ, the Son of the
   living God," he told him that "flesh and blood did not reveal that unto
   him, but his Father who is in heaven," Matt. xvi. 17. It is so with
   them who indeed believe forgiveness in God: "flesh and blood hath not
   revealed it unto them;" -- it hath not been furthered by any thing
   within them or without them, but all lies in opposition unto it. "This
   is the work of God, that we believe," John vi. 29; -- a great work, the
   greatest work that God requireth of us. It is not only a great thing in
   itself (the grace of believing is a great thing), but it is great in
   respect of its object, or what we have to believe, or forgiveness
   itself. The great honour of Abraham's faith lay in this, that deaths
   and difficulties lay in the way of it, Rom. iv. 18-20. But what is a
   dead body and a dead womb to an accusing conscience, a killing law, and
   apprehensions of a God terrible as a consuming fire? all which, as was
   showed, oppose themselves unto a soul called to believe forgiveness.

   What, now, have the most of men, who are confident in the profession of
   this faith, to say unto this thing? Let them speak clearly, and they
   must say that indeed they never found the least difficulty in this
   matter; they never doubted of it, they never questioned it, nor do know
   any reason why they should do so. It is a thing which they have so
   taken for granted as that it never cost them an hour's labour, prayer,
   or meditation about it. Have they had secret reasonings and contendings
   in their hearts about it? No. Have they considered how the objections
   that lie against it may be removed. Not at all. But is it so, indeed,
   that this persuasion is thus bred in you, you know not how? Are the
   corrupted natures of men and the gospel so suited, so complying? Is the
   new covenant grown so connatural to flesh and blood? Is the greatest
   secret that ever was revealed from the bosom of the Father become so
   familiar and easy to the wisdom of the flesh? Is that which was folly
   to the wise Greeks, and a stumbling-block to the wonder-gazing Jews,
   become, on a sudden, wisdom and a plain path to the same principles
   that were in them? But the truth of this matter is, that such men have
   a general, useless, barren notion of pardon, which Satan, presumption,
   tradition, common reports, and the customary hearing of the word, have
   furnished them withal; but for that gospel discovery of forgiveness
   whereof we have been speaking, they are utterly ignorant of it and
   unacquainted with it. To convince such poor creatures of the folly of
   their presumption, I would but desire them to go to some real believers
   that are or may be known unto them. Let them be asked whether they came
   so easily by their faith and apprehensions of forgiveness or no.
   "Alas!" saith one, "these twenty years have I been following after God,
   and yet I have not arrived unto an abiding cheering persuasion of it."
   "I know what it cost me, what trials, difficulties, temptations I
   wrestled with, and went through withal, before I obtained it," saith
   another. "What I have attained unto hath been of unspeakable mercy; and
   it is my daily prayer that I may be preserved in it by the exceeding
   greatness of the power of God, for I continually wrestle with storms
   that are ready to drive me from my anchor." A little of this discourse
   may be sufficient to convince poor, dark, carnal creatures of the folly
   and vanity of their confidence.

   4. There are certain means whereby the revelation and discovery of this
   mystery is made unto the souls of men. By these they do obtain it, or
   they obtain it not. The mystery itself was a secret, hidden in the
   counsel of God from eternity; nor was there any way whereby it might be
   revealed but by the Son of God, and that is done in the word of the
   gospel. If, then, you say you know it, let us inquire how you came so
   to do, and by what means it hath been declared unto you. Hath this been
   done by a word of truth, -- by the promise of the gospel? Was it by
   preaching of the word unto you, or by reading of it, or meditating upon
   it? or did you receive it from and by some seasonable word of or from
   the Scriptures spoken unto you? or hath it insensibly gotten ground
   upon your hearts and minds, upon the strivings and conflicts of your
   souls about sin, from the truth wherein you had been instructed in
   general? or by what other ways or means have you come to that
   acquaintance with it whereof you boast? You can tell how you came by
   your wealth, your gold and silver; you know how you became learned, or
   obtained the knowledge of the mystery of your trade, who taught you in
   it, and how you came by it. There is not any thing wherein you are
   concerned but you can answer these inquiries in a reference unto it.
   Think it, then, no great matter if you are put to answer this question
   also -- By what way or means came you to the knowledge of forgiveness
   which you boast of? Was it by any of those before mentioned, or some
   other? If you cannot answer distinctly to these things, only you say
   you have heard it and believed it ever since you can remember (so those
   said that went before you, so they say with whom you do converse; you
   never met with any one that called it into question, nor heard of any,
   unless it were one or two despairing wretches), it will be justly
   questioned whether you have any portion in this matter or no. If
   uncertain rumours, reports, general notions, lie at the bottom of your
   persuasion, do not suppose that you have any communion with Christ
   therein.

   5. Of them who profess to believe forgiveness, how few are there who
   indeed know what it is! They believe, they say; but as the Samaritans
   worshipped, -- they "know not what." With some, a bold presumption, and
   crying "Peace, peace," goes for the belief of forgiveness. A general
   apprehension of impunity from God, and that they are sinners, yet they
   shall not be punished, passeth with others at the same rate. Some think
   they shall prevail with God by their prayers and desires to let them
   alone, and not cast them into hell. One way or other to escape the
   vengeance of hell, not to be punished in another world, is that which
   men fix their minds upon. But is this that forgiveness which is
   revealed in the gospel? that which we have been treating about? The
   rise and spring of our forgiveness is in the heart and gracious nature
   of God, declared by his name. Have you inquired seriously into this?
   Have you stood at the shore of that infinite ocean of goodness and
   love? Have your souls found supportment and relief from that
   consideration? and have your hearts leaped within you with the thoughts
   of it? Or, if you have never been affected in an especial manner
   herewithal, have you bowed down your souls under the consideration of
   that sovereign act of the will of God that is the next spring of
   forgiveness; that glorious acting of free grace, that when all might
   justly have perished, all having sinned and come short of his glow, God
   would yet have mercy on some? Have you given up yourselves to this
   grace? Is this any thing of that you do believe? Suppose you are
   strangers to this also; what communion with God have you had about it
   in the blood of Christ? We have showed how forgiveness relates
   thereunto; how way is made thereby for the exercise of mercy, in a
   consistency with the glory and honour of the justice of God and of his
   law; how pardon is procured and purchased thereby; with the mysterious
   reconciliation of love and law, and the new disposal of conscience in
   its work and duty by it. What have you to say to these things? Have you
   seen pardon flowing from the heart of the Father through the blood of
   the Son? Have you looked upon it as the price of his life and the
   purchase of his blood? Or have you general thoughts that Christ died
   for sinners, and that on one account or other forgiveness relates unto
   him, but are strangers to the mystery of this great work? Suppose this
   also; let us go a little farther, and inquire whether you know any
   thing that yet remains of the like importance in this matter?
   Forgiveness, as we have showed, is manifested, tendered, exhibited in
   the covenant of grace and promises of the gospel. The rule of the
   efficacy of these is, that they be "mixed with faith," Heb. iv. 2. It
   is well if you are grown up hereunto; but you that are strangers to the
   things before mentioned are no less to this also. Upon the matter, you
   know not, then, what forgiveness is, nor wherein it consists, nor
   whence it comes, nor how it is procured, nor by what means given out
   unto sinners. It is to no purpose for such persons to pretend that they
   believe that whereunto, either notionally or practically, or both, they
   are such utter strangers.

   6. Another inquiry into this matter regards the state and condition
   wherein souls must be before it be possible for them to believe
   forgiveness. If there be such an estate, and it can be evinced that
   very many of the pretenders concerning whom we deal were never brought
   into it, it is then evident that they neither do nor can believe
   forgiveness, however they do and may delude their own souls.

   It hath been showed that the first discovery that was made of pardoning
   grace was unto Adam, presently after the fall. What was then his state
   and condition? how was he prepared for the reception of this great
   mystery in its first discovery? That seems to be a considerable rule of
   proceeding in the same matter. That which is first in any kind is a
   rule to all that follows. Now, what was Adam's condition when the
   revelation of forgiveness was first made to him? It is known from the
   story. Convinced of sin, afraid of punishment, he lay trembling at the
   foot of God: then was forgiveness revealed unto him. So the psalmist
   states it, Ps. cxxx. 3, "If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O
   Lord, who shall stand?" Full of thoughts he is of the desert of sin,
   and of inevitable and eternal ruin, in case God should deal with him
   according to the exigence of the law. In that state is the great
   support of forgiveness with God suggested unto him by the Holy Ghost.
   We know what work our Saviour had with the Pharisees on this account.
   "Are we," say they, "blind also?" "No," saith he; "you say you see,
   therefore your sin remaineth,'?" John ix. 40, 41; -- "It is to no
   purpose to talk of forgiveness to such persons as you are; you must of
   necessity abide in your sins. I came not to call such righteous persons
   as you are, but sinners to repentance; who not only are so, as you are
   also, and that to the purpose, but are sensible of their being so, and
   of their undone condition thereby. The whole have no need of the
   physician, but the sick.' Whilst you are seeming righteous and whole,
   it is to no end to tell you of forgiveness; you cannot understand it
   nor receive it." It is impossible, then, that any one should, in a due
   manner, believe forgiveness in God, unless in a due manner he be
   convinced of sin in himself. If the fallow ground be not broken up, it
   is to no purpose to sow the seed of the gospel. There is neither life,
   power, nor sweetness in this truth, unless a door be opened for its
   entrance by conviction of sin.

   Let us, then, on this ground also, continue our inquiry upon the
   ordinary boasters of their skill in this mystery. You believe there is
   forgiveness with God? Yes. But have you been convinced of sin? Yes. You
   know that you are sinners well enough. Answer, then, but once more as
   to the nature of this conviction of sin which you have. Is it not made
   up of these two ingredients; -- 1. A general notion that you are
   sinners, as all men also are; 2. Particular troublesome reflections
   upon yourselves, when on any eruption of sin conscience accuses,
   rebukes, condemns? You will say, "Yes; what would you require more?"
   This is not the conviction we are inquiring after: that is a work of
   the Spirit by the word; this you speak of, a mere natural work, which
   you can no more be without than you can cease to be men. This will give
   no assistance unto the receiving of forgiveness. But, it may be, you
   will say you have proceeded farther than so, and these things have had
   an improvement in you. Let us, then, a little try whether your process
   has been according to the mind of God, and so whether this invincible
   bar in your way be removed or no; for although every convinced person
   do not believe forgiveness, yet no one who is not convinced doth so.
   Have you, then, been made sensible of your condition by nature, what it
   is to be alienated from the life of God, and to be obnoxious to his
   wrath? Have you been convinced of the universal enmity that is in your
   hearts to the mind of God, and what it is to be at enmity against God.?
   Hath the unspeakable multitude of the sins of your lives been set in
   order by the law before you? And have you considered what it is for
   sinners as you are to have to deal with a righteous and a holy God?
   Hath the Holy Ghost wrought a serious recognition in your hearts of all
   these things, and caused them to abide with you and upon you? If you
   will answer truly, you must say, many of you, that indeed you have not
   been so exercised. You have heard of these things many times, but to
   say that you have gone through with this work, and have had experience
   of them, that you cannot do. Then, I say, you are strangers to
   forgiveness, because you are strangers unto sin. But and if you shall
   say that you have had thoughts to this purpose, and are persuaded that
   you have been thoroughly convinced of sin, I shall yet ask you one
   question more: What effects hath your conviction produced in your
   hearts and lives? Have you been filled with perplexities and
   consternation of spirit thereupon? have you had fears, dreads, or
   terrors, to wrestle withal? It may be you will say, "No;" nor will I
   insist upon that inquiry. But this I deal with you in: Hath it filled
   you with self-loathing and abhorrency, with self-condemnation and
   abasement? If it will do any thing, this it will do. If you come short
   here, it is justly to be feared that all your other pretences are of no
   value. Now, where there is no work of conviction there is no faith of
   forgiveness, whatever is pretended. And how many vain boasters this
   sword will cut off is evident.

   7. We have yet a greater evidence than all these. Men live in sin, and
   therefore they do not believe forgiveness of sin. Faith in general
   "purifies the heart," Acts xv. 9; our "souls are purified in obeying
   the truth," 1 Pet. i. 22. And the life is made fruitful by it: James
   ii. 22, "Faith worketh by works," and makes itself perfect by them. And
   the doctrine concerning forgiveness hath a special influence into all
   holiness: Tit. ii. 11, 12, "The grace of God that bringeth salvation,
   teacheth us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
   soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world." And that is
   the grace whereof we speak. No man can, then, believe forgiveness of
   sin without a detestation and relinquishment of it. The ground of this
   might be farther manifested, and the way of the efficacy of faith of
   forgiveness unto a forsaking of sin, if need were; but all that own the
   gospel must acknowledge this principle. The real belief of the pardon
   of sin is prevalent with men not to live longer in sin.

   But now, what are the greatest number of those who pretend to receive
   this truth? Are their hearts purified by it? Are their consciences
   purged? Are their lives changed? Do they "deny ungodliness and worldly
   lusts?" Doth forgiveness teach them so to do? Have they found it
   effectual to these purposes? Whence is it, then, that there is such a
   bleating and bellowing to the contrary amongst them?

   Some of you are drunkards, some of you swearers, some of you unclean
   persons, some of you liars, some of you worldly, some of you haters of
   all the ways of Christ, and all his concernments upon the earth; proud,
   covetous, boasters, self-seekers, envious, wrathful, back-biters,
   malicious, praters, slanderers, and the like. And shall we think that
   such as these believe forgiveness of sin? God forbid. Again; some of
   you are dark, ignorant, blind, utterly unacquainted with the mystery of
   the gospel, nor do at all make it your business to inquire into it.
   Either you hear it not at all, or negligently, slothfully, customarily,
   to no purpose. Let not such persons deceive their own souls; to live in
   sin and yet to believe the forgiveness of sin is utterly impossible.
   Christ will not be a minister of sin, nor give his gospel to be a
   doctrine of licentiousness for your sakes; nor shall you be forgiven
   that you may be delivered to do more abominations, God forbid.

   If any shall say that they thank God they are no such publicans as
   those mentioned, they are no drunkards, no swearers, no unclean
   persons, nor the like, so that they are not concerned in this
   consideration (their lives and their duties give another account of
   them), then yet consider farther, that the Pharisees were all that you
   say of yourselves, and yet the greatest despisers of forgiveness that
   ever were in the world; and that because they hated the light, on this
   account, that their deeds were evil. And for your duties you mention,
   what, I pray, is the root and spring of them? Are they influenced from
   this faith of forgiveness you boast of or no? May it not be feared that
   it is utterly otherwise? You do not perform them because you love the
   gospel, but because you fear the law. If the truth were known, I doubt
   it would appear that you get nothing by your believing of pardon but an
   encouragement unto sin. Your goodness, such as it is, springs from
   another root. It may be, also, that you ward yourselves by it against
   the strokes of conscience or the guilt of particular sins; this is as
   bad as the other. It is as good be encouraged unto sin to commit it, as
   be encouraged under sin so as to be kept from humiliation for it. None
   under heaven are more remote from the belief of grace and pardon than
   such persons are; all their righteousness is from the law, and their
   sin in a great measure from the gospel.

   8. They that believe forgiveness in a due manner, believe it for the
   ends and purposes for which it is revealed of God. This will farther
   improve and carry on the former consideration. If God reveals any thing
   for one end and purpose, and men use it quite unto another, they do not
   receive the word of God, nor believe the thing revealed, but steal the
   word and delude their own souls.

   Let us, then, weigh to what ends and purposes this forgiveness was
   first revealed by God, for which also its manifestation is still
   continued in the gospel. We have showed before who it was to whom this
   revelation was first made, and what condition he was in when it was so
   made unto him. A lost, wretched creature, without hope or help he was;
   how he should come to obtain acceptance with God he knew not. God
   reveals forgiveness unto him by Christ to be his all. The intention of
   God in it was, that a sinner's all should be of grace, Rom. xi. 6. If
   any thing be added unto it for the same end and purpose, then "grace is
   no more grace." Again; God intended it as a new foundation of
   obedience, of love, and thankfulness. That men should love because
   forgiven, and be holy because pardoned, as I have showed before, --
   that it might be the righteousness of a sinner, and a spring of new
   obedience in him, all to the praise of grace, -- were God's ends in its
   revelation.

   Our inquiry, then, is, Whether men do receive this revelation as unto
   these ends, and use it for these purposes, and these only? I might
   evince the contrary, by passing through the general abuses of the
   doctrine of grace which are mentioned in the Scripture and common in
   the world; but it will not be needful. Instead of believing, the most
   of men seem to put a studied despite on the gospel. They either
   proclaim it to be an unholy and polluted way, by turning its grace into
   lasciviousness, or a weak and insufficient way, by striving to twist it
   in with their own righteousness; both which are an abomination unto the
   Lord.

   From these and such other considerations of the like importance as
   might be added, it is evident that our word is not in vain, nor the
   exhortation which is to be built upon it. It appears that
   notwithstanding the great noise and pretences to this purpose that are
   in the world, they are but few who seriously receive this fundamental
   truth of the gospel, -- namely, that there is forgiveness with God.
   Poor creatures sport themselves with their own deceivings, and perish
   by their own delusions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Exhortation unto the belief of the forgiveness that is with God --
   Reasons for it, and the necessity of it.

   We shall now proceed unto the direct uses of this great truth; for
   having laid our foundation in the word that will not fail, and having
   given, as we hope, sufficient evidence unto the truth of it, our last
   work is to make that improvement of it unto the good of the souls of
   men which all along was aimed at. The persons concerned in this truth
   are all sinners whatever. No sort of sinners are unconcerned in it,
   none are excluded from it. And we may cast them all under two heads:--

   First, Such as never yet sincerely closed with the promise of grace,
   nor have ever yet received forgiveness from God in a way of believing.
   These we have already endeavoured to undeceive, and to discover those
   false presumptions whereby they are apt to ruin and destroy their own
   souls. These we would guide now into safe and pleasant paths, wherein
   they may find assured rest and peace.

   Secondly, Others there are who have received it, but being again
   entangled by sin, or clouded by darkness and temptations, or weakened
   by unbelief, know not how to improve it to their peace and comfort.
   This is the condition of the soul represented in this psalm, and which
   we shall therefore apply ourselves unto in an especial manner in its
   proper place.

   Our exhortation, then, is unto both -- to the first, that they would
   receive it, that they may have life; to the latter, that they would
   improve it, that they may have peace; -- to the former, that they would
   not overlook, disregard, or neglect so great salvation as is tendered
   unto them; to the latter, that they would stir up the grace of God that
   is in them, to mix with the grace of God that is declared unto them.

   I shall begin with the first sort, -- those who are yet utter strangers
   from the covenant of grace, who never yet upon saving grounds believed
   this forgiveness, who never yet once tasted of gospel pardon. Poor
   sinners! this word is unto you.

   Be it that you have heard or read the same word before, or others like
   unto it, to the same purpose, -- it may be often, it may be a hundred
   times, -- it is your concernment to hear it again; God would have it
   so; the testimony of Jesus Christ is thus to be accomplished. This
   "counsel of God" we must "declare," that we may be "pure from the blood
   of all men," Acts xx. 26, 27; and that not once or twice, but in
   preaching the word we must be "instant in season, out of season;
   reproving, rebuking, exhorting with all long-suffering and doctrine," 2
   Tim. iv. 2. And for you, woe unto you when God leaves thus speaking
   unto you! when he refuseth to exhort you any more, woe unto you! This
   is God's departure from any person or people, when he will deal with
   them no more about forgiveness; and saith he, "Woe to them when I
   depart from them!" Hos. ix. 12. O that God, therefore, would give unto
   such persons seeing eyes and hearing ears, that the word of grace may
   never more be spoken unto them in vain!

   Now, in our exhortation to such persons, we shall proceed gradually,
   according as the matter will bear, and the nature of it doth require.
   Consider, therefore, --

   First, That notwithstanding all your sins, all the evil that your own
   hearts know you to be guilty of, and that hidden mass or evil treasure
   of sin which is in you, which you are not able to look into;
   notwithstanding that charge that lies upon you from your own
   consciences, and that dreadful sentence and curse of the law which you
   are obnoxious unto; notwithstanding all the just grounds that you have
   to apprehend that God is your enemy, and will be so unto eternity; --
   yet there are terms of peace and reconciliation provided and proposed
   between him and your souls. This, in the first place, is spoken out by
   the word we have insisted on. Whatever else it informs us of, this it
   positively asserts, -- namely, that there is a way whereby sinners may
   come to be accepted with God; for "there is forgiveness with him, that
   he may be feared." And we hope that we have not confirmed it by so many
   testimonies, by so many evidences, in vain. Now, that you may see how
   great a privilege this is, and how much your concernment lies in it,
   consider, --

   1. That this belongs unto you in an especial manner; it is your
   peculiar advantage.

   It is not so with the angels that sinned. There were never any terms of
   peace or reconciliation proposed unto them, nor ever shall be, unto
   eternity. There is no way of escape provided for them. Having once
   sinned, as you have done a thousand times, God "spared them not, but
   cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to
   be reserved unto judgment," 2 Pet. ii. 4.

   It is not so with them that are dead in their sins, if but one moment
   past. Ah! how would many souls who are departed, it may be not an hour
   since, out of this world, rejoice for an interest in this privilege,
   the hearing of terms of peace, once more, between God and them! But
   their time is past, their house is left unto them desolate. As the tree
   falleth, so it must lie: "It is appointed unto men once to die, and
   after this the judgment," Heb. ix. 27. After death there are no terms
   of peace, nothing but judgment. "The living, the living," he alone is
   capable of this advantage.

   It is not so with them to whom the gospel is not preached. God suffers
   them to walk in their own ways, and calls them not thus to repentance.
   The terms of reconciliation which some fancy to be offered in the
   shining of the sun and falling of the rain, never brought souls to
   peace with God. Life and immortality are brought to light only by the
   gospel. This is your privilege who yet live, and yet have the word
   sounding in your ears.

   It is not thus with them who have sinned against the Holy Ghost, though
   yet alive, and living where the word of forgiveness is preached. God
   proposeth unto them no terms of reconciliation. "Blasphemy against
   him," saith Christ, "shall not be forgiven," Matt. xii. 31. There is no
   forgiveness for such sinners; and we, if we knew them, ought not to
   pray for them, 1 John v. 16. Their sin is "unto death." And what number
   may be in this condition God knows.

   This word, then, is unto you; these terms of peace are proposed unto
   you. This is that which in an especial manner you are to apply
   yourselves unto; and woe unto you if you should be found to have
   neglected it at the last day! Wherefore, consider, --

   2. By whom these terms are proposed unto you, and by whom they were
   procured for you. By whom are they proposed? Who shall undertake to
   umpire the business, the controversy between God and sinners? No
   creature, doubtless, is either meet or worthy to interpose in this
   matter, -- I mean, originally on his own account; for "who hath known
   the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counsellor?" Wherefore, it
   is God himself who proposeth these terms; and not only proposeth them,
   but invites, exhorts, and persuades you to accept of them. This the
   whole Scriptures testify unto. It is fully expressed, 2 Cor. v. 18-20.
   He hath provided them, he hath proposed them, and makes use only of
   men, of ministers, to act in his name. And excuse us if we are a little
   earnest with you in this matter. Alas! our utmost that we can, by zeal
   for his glory or compassion unto your souls, raise our thoughts, minds,
   spirits, words unto, comes infinitely short of his own pressing
   earnestness herein. See Isa. lv. 1-4. Oh, infinite condescension! Oh,
   blessed grace! Who is this that thus bespeaks you? He against whom you
   have sinned, of whom you are justly afraid; he whose laws you have
   broken, and whose name you have dishonoured; he who needs not you, nor
   your love, nor your friendship, nor your salvation! It is he who
   proposeth unto you these terms of reconciliation and peace! Consider
   the exhortation of the apostle upon this consideration: Heb. xii. 25,
   "See that ye refuse not him that speaketh from heaven." It is God that
   speaks unto you in this matter, and he speaks unto you from heaven. And
   he doth therein forego all the advantage that he hath against you for
   your destruction. Woe would be unto your souls, and that for ever, if
   you should refuse him.

   3. By whom were these terms procured for you? and by what means? Do not
   think that this matter was brought about by chance, or by an ordinary
   undertaking. Remember that the proposal made unto you this day cost no
   less than the price of the blood of the Son of God. It is the fruit of
   the travail of his soul. For this he prayed, he wept, he suffered, he
   died. And shall it now be neglected or despised by you? Will you yet
   account the blood of the covenant to be a common thing? Will you
   exclude yourselves from all benefit of the purchase of these terms, and
   only leave your souls to answer for the contempt of the price whereby
   they were purchased?

   4. Consider that you are sinners, great sinners, cursed sinners; some
   of you, it may be, worse than innumerable of your fellow-sinners were
   who are now in hell. God might long since have cast you off
   everlastingly from all expectation of mercy, and have caused all your
   hopes to perish; or he might have left you alive, and yet have refused
   to deal with you any more. He could have caused your sun to go down at
   noon-day, and have given you darkness instead of vision. He could
   respite your lives for a season, and yet "swear in his wrath that you
   should never enter into his rest." It is now otherwise. How long it may
   be so, nor you nor I know any thing at all. God only knows what will be
   your time, what your continuance. We are to speak whilst it is called
   "To-day." And this is that for the present which I have to offer unto
   you -- God declares that there is forgiveness with him, that your
   condition is not desperate nor helpless. There are yet terms of peace
   proposed unto you. Methinks it cannot but seem strange that poor
   sinners should not at the least stir up themselves to inquire after
   them. When a poor man had sold himself of old and his children to be
   servants, and parted with the land of his inheritance unto another,
   because of his poverty, with what heart do you think did he hear the
   sound of the trumpet when it began to proclaim the year of jubilee,
   wherein he and all his were to go out at liberty, and to return unto
   his possession and inheritance? And shall not poor servants of sin,
   slaves unto Satan, that have forfeited all their inheritance in this
   world and that which is to come, attend unto any proclamation of the
   year of rest, of the acceptable year of the Lord? And this is done in
   the tender of terms of peace with God in this matter. Do not put it
   off; this belongs unto you; the great concernment of your souls lies in
   it. And it is a great matter; for consider, --

   5. That when the angels came to bring the news of the birth of our Lord
   Jesus, they say, "We bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall
   be to all people," Luke ii. 10. What are these joyful tidings? what was
   the matter of this report? Why, "This day is born a Saviour, Christ the
   Lord," verse 11. It is only this, "A Saviour is born; a way of escape
   is provided," and farther they do not proceed. Yet this they say is a
   matter of "great joy;" as it was indeed. It is so to every burdened,
   convinced sinner, a matter of unspeakable joy and rejoicing. Oh,
   blessed words! "A Saviour is born!" This gives life to a sinner, and
   opens "a door of hope in the valley of Achor," the first rescue of a
   sin-distressed soul. Upon the matter, it was all that the saints for
   many ages had to live upon; and that not in the enjoyment, but only the
   expectation. They lived on that word, "The seed of the woman shall
   break the serpent's head;" that is, a way of deliverance is provided
   for sinners. This with all "diligence they inquired into," 1 Pet. i.
   10-12; and improved it to their eternal advantage. As of old, Jacob,
   when he saw the waggons that his son Joseph had sent to bring him unto
   him, it is said his spirit "revived;" so did they upon their obscure
   discovery of a way of forgiveness. They looked upon the promise of it
   as that which God had sent to bring them unto him; and they saw the day
   of the coming of Christ in it, and rejoiced. How much more have sinners
   now reason so to do, when the substance of the promise is exhibited,
   and the news of his coming proclaimed unto them! This, then, is a great
   matter, -- namely, that terms of peace and reconciliation are proposed,
   in that it is made known that there is forgiveness with God. Upon these
   considerations, then, we pursue that exhortation which we have in hand.

   If any of you were justly condemned to a cruel and shameful death, and
   lay trembling in the expectation of the execution of it, and a man
   designed for that purpose should come unto him and tell him that there
   were terms propounded on which his life might be spared, only he came
   away like Ahimaaz before he heard the particulars; -- would it not be a
   reviving unto him? Would he not cry out, "Pray, inquire what they are;
   for there is not any thing so difficult which I will not undergo to
   free myself from this miserable condition?" Would it not change the
   whole frame of the spirit of such a man, and, as it were, put new life
   into him? But now, if, instead hereof, he should be froward, stubborn,
   and obstinate, take no notice of the messenger, or say, "Let the judge
   keep his terms to himself," without inquiring what they are, that he
   would have nothing to do with them; -- would not such a person be
   deemed to perish deservedly? Doth he not bring a double destruction
   upon himself, -- first of deserving death by his crimes, and then by
   refusing the honest and good way of delivery tendered unto him? I
   confess it oftentimes falls out that men may come to inquire after
   these terms of peace, which, when they are revealed, they like them
   not, but, with the young man in the gospel, they go away sorrowful: the
   cursed wickedness and misery of which condition, which befalls many
   convinced persons, shall be spoken unto afterwards; at present I speak
   unto them who never yet attended in sincerity unto these terms, nor
   seriously inquired after them. Think you what you please of your
   condition and of yourselves, or choose whether you will think of it or
   no, -- pass your time in a full regardlessness of your present and
   future estate, -- yet, indeed, thus it is with you as to your eternal
   concerns: you lie under the sentence of a bitter, shameful, and
   everlasting death; you have done so in the midst of all your jollity,
   ever since you came into this world; and you are in the hand of Him who
   can, in the' twinkling of an eye, destroy both body and soul in
   hell-fire. In this state and condition men are sent on purpose to let
   you know that there are terms of peace, there is yet a way of escape
   for you; and that you may not avoid the issue aimed at, they tell you
   that God, that cannot lie, hath commanded them to tell you so. If you
   question the truth of what they say, they are ready to produce their
   warrant under God's own hand and seal. Here, then, is no room for
   tergiversation or excuses. Certainly, if you have any care of your
   eternal estate, if you have any drop of tender blood running in your
   veins towards your own souls, if you have any rational considerations
   dwelling in your minds, if all be not defaced and obliterated through
   the power of lust and love of sin, you cannot but take yourselves to be
   unspeakably concerned in this proposal. But now, if, instead hereof,
   you give up yourselves unto the power of unbelief, the will of Satan,
   the love of your lusts and this present world, so as to take no notice
   of this errand or message from God, nor once seriously to inquire after
   the nature and importance of the terms proposed, can you escape? shall
   you be delivered? will your latter end be peace? The Lord knows it will
   be otherwise with you, and that unto eternity.

   So the apostle assures us, 2 Cor. iv. 3, 4, "If our gospel be hid, it
   is hid to them that are lost: in whom the god of this world hath
   blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the
   glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
   them." If you receive not this word, if it be hid from you, it is from
   the power and efficacy of Satan upon your minds. And what will be the
   end? Perish you must and shall, and that for ever.

   Remember the parable of our Saviour: Luke xiv. 31, 32, "What king,
   going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and
   consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh
   against him with twenty thousand? or else, while the other is yet a
   great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of
   peace." That which he teacheth in this parable is, the necessity that
   lies on us of making peace with God, whom we have provoked, and justly
   made to be our enemy; as also our utter impotency to resist and
   withstand him when he shall come forth in a way of judgment and
   vengeance against us. But here lies a difference in this matter, such
   as is allowed in all similitudes. Amongst men at variance, it is not
   his part who is the stronger, and secure of success, to send to the
   weaker, whom he hath in his power, to accept of terms of peace. Here it
   is otherwise: God, who is infinitely powerful, justly provoked, and
   able to destroy poor sinners in a moment, when now he is not very far
   off, but at the very door, sends himself an ambassage with conditions
   of peace. And shall he be refused by you? will you yet neglect his
   offers? How great, then, will be your destruction!

   Hear, then, once more, poor sin-hardened, senseless souls, ye
   stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness. Is it nothing unto you
   that the great and holy God, whom ye have provoked all your days, and
   whom you yet continue to provoke, -- who hath not the least need of you
   or your salvation, -- who can, when he pleaseth, eternally glorify
   himself in your destruction, -- should of his own accord send unto you,
   to let you know that he is willing to be at peace with you on the terms
   he had prepared? The enmity began on your part, the danger is on your
   part only, and he might justly expect that the message for peace should
   begin on your part also; but he begins with you. And shall he be
   rejected? The prophet well expresseth this, Isa. xxx. 15, "Thus saith
   the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be
   saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye
   would not." The love and condescension that is in these words, on the
   one hand, on the part of God, and the folly and ingratitude mentioned
   in them on the other hand, is inexpressible. They are fearful words,
   "But ye would not." Remember this against another day. As our Saviour
   says, in the like manner, to the Jews, "Ye will not come to me, that ye
   might have life." Whatever is pretended, it is will and stubbornness
   that lie at the bottom of this refusal.

   Wherefore, that either you may obtain advantage by it, or that the way
   of the Lord may be prepared for the glorifying of himself upon you, I
   shall leave this word before all them that hear or read it, as the
   testimony which God requires to be given unto his grace. There are
   terms of peace with God provided for and tendered unto you. It is yet
   called To-day; harden not your hearts like them of old, who could not
   enter into the rest of God by reason of unbelief, Heb. iii. 19. Some of
   you, it may be, are old in sins and unacquainted with God; some of you,
   it may be, have been great sinners, scandalous sinners; and some of
   you, it may be, have reason to apprehend yourselves near the grave, and
   so also to hell; some of you, it may be, have your consciences
   disquieted and galled; and it may be some of you are under some outward
   troubles and perplexities, that cause you a little to look about you;
   and some of you, it may be, are in the madness of your natural strength
   and lusts, -- "your breasts are full of milk and your bones of marrow,"
   and your hearts of sin, pride, and contempt of the ways of God. All is
   one: this word is unto you all; and I shall only mind you that "it is a
   fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." You hear the
   voice or read the words of a poor worm; but the message is the message,
   and the word is the word, of Him who shaketh heaven and earth.
   Consider, then, well what you have to do, and what answer you will
   return unto Him who will not be mocked.

   But you will say, "Why, what great matter is there that you have in
   hand? Why is it urged with so much earnestness? We have heard the same
   words a hundred times over. The last Lord's day such a one, or such a
   one, preached to the same purpose; and what need it be insisted on now
   again with so much importunity?"

   But is it so, indeed, that you have thus frequently been dealt withal,
   and do yet continue in an estate of irreconciliation? My heart is
   pained for you, to think of your woful and almost remediless condition.
   If "he that being often reproved, and yet hardeneth his neck, shall
   suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy," Prov. xxix. 1, how
   much more will he be so who, being often invited unto peace with God,
   yet hardeneth his heart, and refuseth to treat with him! Methinks I
   hear his voice concerning you: "Those mine enemies, they shall not
   taste of the supper that I have prepared." Be it, then, that the word
   in hand is a common word unto you, you set no value upon it, -- then
   take your way and course in sin; stumble, fall, and perish. It is not
   so slight a matter to poor convinced sinners, that tremble at the word
   of God. These will prize it and improve it. We shall follow, then, that
   counsel, chap. xxxi. 6, "Give strong drink unto him that is ready to
   perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts." We shall tender
   this new wine of the gospel to poor, sad-hearted, conscience-distressed
   sinners, -- sinners that are ready to perish: to them it will be
   pleasant; they will drink of it and forget their poverty, and remember
   their misery no more. It shall take away all their sorrow and sadness,
   when you shall be drunk with the fruit of your lusts, and spue, and lie
   down and not rise again.

   But now, if any of you shall begin to say in your hearts that you would
   willingly treat with God, -- "Oh that the day were come wherein we
   might approach unto him! let him speak what he pleaseth, and propose
   what terms he pleaseth, we are ready to hear," -- then consider, --

   Secondly, That the terms provided for you, and proposed unto you, are
   equal, holy, righteous, yea, pleasant and easy. This being another
   general head of our work in hand, before I proceed to the farther
   explication and confirmation of it, I shall educe one or two
   observations from what hath been delivered on the first; as, --

   1. See here on what foundation we preach the gospel. Many disputes
   there are whether Christ died for all individuals of mankind or no. If
   we say, "No, but only for the elect, who are some of all sorts;" some
   then tell us we cannot invite all men promiscuously to believe. But why
   so? We invite not men as all men, no man as one of all men, but all men
   as sinners; and we know that Christ died for sinners. But is this the
   first thing that we are, in the dispensation of the gospel, to propose
   to the soul of a sinner under the law, that Christ died for him in
   particular? Is that the beginning of our message unto him? Were not
   this a ready way to induce him to conclude, "Let me, then, continue in
   sin, that grace may abound?" -- No; but this is in order of nature our
   first work, even that which we have had in hand; this is the "beginning
   of the gospel of Jesus Christ;" this is" the voice of one crying in the
   wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord:" -- "There is a way of
   reconciliation provided. God is in Christ reconciling the world to
   himself.' There is a way of acceptance; there is forgiveness with him
   to be obtained." At this threshold of the Lord's house doth the
   greatest part of men to whom the gospel is preached fall and perish,
   never looking in to see the treasures that are in the house itself,
   never coming into any such state and condition wherein they have any
   ground or bottom to inquire whether Christ died for them in particular
   or no. They believe not this report, nor take any serious notice of it.
   This was the ministry of the Baptist, and they who received it not
   "rejected the counsel of God" concerning their salvation, Luke vii. 10,
   and so perished in their sins. This is the sum of the blessed
   invitation given by Wisdom, Prov. ix. 1-5. And here men stumble, fall,
   and perish, chap. i. 29, 30.

   2. You that have found grace and favour to accept of these terms, and
   thereby to obtain peace with God, learn to live in a holy admiration of
   his condescension and love therein. That he would provide such terms;
   that he would reveal them unto you; that he would enable you to receive
   them; -- unspeakable love and grace lies in it all. Many have not these
   terms revealed unto them; few find favour to accept of them. And of
   whom is it that you have obtained this peculiar mercy?

   Do you aright consider the nature of this matter? The Scripture
   proposeth it as an object of eternal admiration: "So God loved the
   world;" "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us"
   first. Live in this admiration, and do your utmost, in your several
   capacities, to prevail with your friends, relations, acquaintance, to
   hearken after this great treaty of peace with God, whose terms we shall
   nextly consider, as before in general they were expressed.

   Secondly, The terms provided for you, and proposed unto you, are equal,
   holy, righteous, yea, pleasant and easy, Hos. ii. 18, 19. They are not
   such as a cursed, guilty sinner might justly expect, but such as are
   meet for an infinitely good and gracious God to propose; -- not suited
   to the wisdom of man, but full of the "wisdom of God," 2 Cor. ii. 6, 7.
   The poor, convinced wretch thinking of dealing with God, Micah vi. 6,
   7, rolls in his mind what terms he is like to meet withal; and fixes on
   the most dreadful, difficult, and impossible that can be imagined.
   "If," saith he, "any thing be done with this great and most high God,
   it must be by rivers,' thousands,' and ten thousands,' children,
   first-born;' whatever is dreadful and terrible to nature, whatever is
   impossible for me to perform, that is it which he looks for." But the
   matter is quite otherwise. The terms are wholly of another nature: it
   is a way of mere mercy, a way of free forgiveness. The apostle lays it
   down, Rom. iii. 21-26. It is a way of propitiation, of pardon, of
   forgiveness in the blood of Christ; the terms are, the acceptance of
   the forgiveness that we have described. Who would not think, now, that
   the whole world would run in to be made partakers of these terms,
   willingly accepting of them? But it proves for the most part quite
   otherwise. Men like not this way, of all others. "It had been
   something," says Naaman, "if the prophet had come and done so and so;
   but this, Go wash, and be clean,' I do not like it; I am but deluded."
   Men think within themselves, that had it been some great thing that was
   required of them that they might be saved, they would with all speed
   address themselves thereunto; but to come to God by Christ, to be
   freely forgiven, without more ado, they like it not. Some rigid,
   austere penances, some compensatory obedience, some satisfactory
   mortification or purgatory, had been a more likely way. This of mere
   pardon in and by the cross, it is but folly, 1 Cor. i. 18, 20. "I had
   rather," saith the Jew, "have it as it were by the works of the law,'
   Rom. ix. 32, x. 3. This way of grace and forgiveness I like not." So
   say others also; so practise others every day. Either this way is
   wholly rejected, or it is mended by some additions; which with God is
   all one with the rejection of it.

   Here multitudes of souls deceive themselves and perish. I know not
   whether it be more difficult to persuade an unconvinced person to think
   of any terms, or a convinced person to accept of these. Let men say
   what they will, and pretend what they please, yet practically they like
   not this way of forgiveness. I shall therefore offer some subservient
   considerations, tending to the furtherance of your souls in the
   acceptance of the terms proposed --

   1. This is the way, these are the terms of God's own choosing; he found
   out this way, he established it himself. He did it when all was lost
   and undone. He did it, not upon our desire, request, or proposal, but
   merely of his own accord; and why should we contend with him about it?
   If God will have us saved in a way of mere mercy and forgiveness, if
   his wisdom and sovereignty be in it, shall we oppose him, and say we
   like it not? Yet this is the language of unbelief, Rom. x. 3. Many poor
   creatures have disputed it with God, until at length, being overpowered
   as it were by the Spirit, [they] have said, "If it must be so, and God
   will save us by mercy and grace, let it be so; we yield ourselves to
   his will;" and yet throughout their disputes dreamed of nothing but
   that their own unworthiness only kept them from closing with the
   promise of the gospel.

   Of this nature was that way of Satan whereby he deceived our first
   parents of their interest in the covenant of works. "The terms of it,"
   saith he, "as apprehended by you, are unequal. Yea, hath God said, Ye
   shall eat of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of knowledge of
   good and evil ye shall not eat, lest ye die?' Come; ye shall not die:
   for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall
   be opened.' There is no proportion between the disobedience and the
   threatening; the issue cannot be such as is feared." And by these means
   he ruined them. Thus, also, he proceeds to deprive souls of their
   interest in the covenant of grace, whereunto they are invited: "The
   terms of it are unequal, how can any man believe them? There is no
   proportion between the obedience and the promise. To have pardon,
   forgiveness, life, and a blessed eternity, on believing! -- who can
   rest in it?" And here lies a conspiracy between Satan and unbelief,
   against the wisdom, goodness, love, grace, and sovereignty of God. The
   poison of this deceit lies in this, that neither the righteousness nor
   the mercy of God is of that infiniteness as indeed they are. The
   apostle, to remove this fond imagination, calls us to the pleasure of
   God: 1 Cor. i. 21, "It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching," --
   that is, by the gospel preached, which they esteemed foolishness, --
   "to save them that believe." He suffered men, indeed, to make trial of
   other ways; and when their insufficiency for the ends men proposed to
   themselves was sufficiently manifested, it pleased him to reveal his
   way. And what are we, that we should contend about it with him? This
   rejection of the way of personal righteousness, and choosing the way of
   grace and forgiveness, God asserts: Jer. xxxi. 31-35, "Behold, the days
   come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of
   Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according to the covenant that
   I made with their fathers" (in which administration of the covenant, as
   far as it had respect unto typical mercies, much depended on their
   personal obedience): "but this shall be the covenant that I will make
   with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put
   my law," etc., "for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember
   their sin no more." Let, then, this way stand, and the way of man's
   wisdom and self-righteousness perish for ever.

   2. This is the way that above all others tends directly and immediately
   to the glory of God. God hath managed and ordered all things in this
   way of forgiveness, so as "no flesh should glory in his presence," but
   that "he that glorieth should glory in the Lord," 1 Cor. i. 29, 31.
   "Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? by the law of
   works? Nay; but by the law of faith," Rom. iii. 27. It might be easily
   manifested that God hath so laid the design of saving sinners by
   forgiveness according to the law of faith, that it is utterly
   impossible that any soul should, on any account whatever, have the
   least ground of glorying or boasting in itself, either absolutely or in
   comparison with them that perish. "If Abraham," saith the same apostle,
   "were justified by works, he had whereof to glory; but not before God,"
   chap. iv. 2. The obedience of works would have been so infinitely
   disproportionate to the reward, which was God himself, that there had
   been no glorying before God, but therein his goodness and grace must he
   acknowledged; yet in comparison with others who yielded not the
   obedience required, he would have had wherein to glory: but now this
   also is cut off by the way of forgiveness, and no pretence is left for
   any to claim the least share in the glory of it but God alone. And
   herein lies the excellency of faith, that it "gives glory to God,"
   chap. iv. 20; the denial whereof, under various pretences, is the issue
   of proud unbelief. And this is that which God will bring all unto, or
   they shall perish, -- namely, that shame be ours, and the whole glory
   of our salvation be his alone. So be expresseth his design, Isa. xlv.
   22-25. Verse 22, he proposeth himself as the only relief for sinners:
   "Look unto me," saith he, "and be saved, all the ends of the earth."
   But what if men take some other course, and look well to themselves,
   and so decline this way of mere mercy and grace? Why, saith he, verse
   23, "I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
   righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow,
   every tongue shall swear." Look you unto that, "But I have sworn that
   you shall either do so, or answer your disobedience at the day of
   judgment;" whereunto Paul applies those words, Rom. xiv. 11. What do
   the saints hereupon? Isa. xlv. 24, 25, "Surely, shall one say, in the
   Lord have I righteousness and strength. In the Lord shall all the seed
   of Israel be justified, and shall glory." They bring their hearts to
   accept of all righteousness from him, and to give all glory unto him.

   God at first placed man in a blessed state and condition, -- in such a
   dependence on himself as that he might have wrought out his eternal
   happiness with a great reputation of glory unto himself. "Man being in
   this honour," saith the psalmist, "abode not." God now fixes on another
   way, as I said, wherein all the glory shall be his own, as the apostle
   at large sets it forth, Rom. iii. 21-26. Now, neither the way from
   which Adam fell, nor that wherein some of the angels continued, which
   for the substance were the same, is to be compared with this of
   forgiveness, as to the bringing glory unto God. I hate curiosities and
   conjectures in the things of God, yet, upon the account of the
   interposition of the blood of Christ, I think I may boldly say there
   comes more glory to God by saving one sinner in this way of
   forgiveness, than in giving the reward of blessedness to all the angels
   in heaven: so seems it to appear from that solemn representation we
   have of the ascription of glory to God by the whole creation, Rev. v.
   9-14. All centres in the bringing forth forgiveness by the blood of the
   Lamb.

   I insist the more on this, because it lies so directly against that
   cursed principle of unbelief which reigns in the hearts of the most,
   and often disquiets the best. That a poor ungodly sinner, going to God
   with the guilt of all his sins upon him, to receive forgiveness at his
   hand, doth bring more glory unto him than the obedience of an angel,
   men are not over ready to think, nor can be prepared for it but by
   itself. And the formal nature of that unbelief which worketh in
   convinced sinners lies in a refusal to give unto God the whole glory of
   salvation. There are many hurtful controversies in religion that are
   managed in the world with great noise and clamour, but this is the
   greatest and most pernicious of them all; and it is for the most part
   silently transacted in the souls of men, although under various forms
   and pretences. It hath also broken forth in writings and disputations;
   -- that is, whether God or man shall have the glory of salvation; or
   whether it shall wholly be ascribed unto God, or that man also, on one
   account or other, may come in for a share. Now, if this be the state
   and condition with any of you, that you will rather perish than God
   should have his glory, what shall we say but, "Go, ye cursed souls,
   perish for ever, without the least compassion from God, or any that
   love him, angels or men."

   If you shall say, for your parts you are contented with this course, --
   let God have the glory, so you may be forgiven and saved; there is yet
   just cause to suspect lest this be a selfish contempt of God. It is a
   great thing to give glory unto God by believing in a due manner. Such
   slight returns seem not to have the least relation unto it. Take heed
   that, instead of believing, you be not found mockers, and so your bands
   be made strong.

   But a poor convinced sinner may here find encouragement. Thou wouldst
   willingly come to acquaintance with God, and so attain salvation? "Oh,
   my soul longeth for it!" Wouldst thou willingly take that course for
   the obtaining those ends which will bring most glory unto God? "Surely
   it is meet and most equal that I should do so." What, now, if one
   should come and tell thee from the Lord of a way whereby thou, poor,
   sinful, self-condemned creature, mightst bring as much glory unto God
   as any angel in heaven is able to do? "Oh, if I might bring the least
   glory unto God, I should rejoice in it!" Behold, then, the way which
   himself hath fixed on for the exaltation of his glory, even that thou
   shouldst come to him merely upon the account of grace in the blood of
   Christ for pardon and forgiveness; and the Lord strengthen thee to give
   up thyself thereunto!

   3. Consider that if this way of salvation be refused, there is no other
   way for you. We do not propose this way of forgiveness as the best and
   most pleasant, but as the only way. There is no other name given but
   that of Christ; no other way but this of forgiveness. Here lies your
   choice; take this path, or perish for ever. It is a shame, indeed, unto
   our cursed nature that there should be any need to use this argument,
   -- that we will neither submit to God's sovereignty nor delight in his
   glory; but seeing it must be used, let it be so. I intend neither to
   flatter men nor to frighten them, but to tell them the truth as it is.
   If you continue in your present state and condition; if you rest on
   what you do or what you hope to do; if you support yourselves with
   general hopes of mercy, mixed with your own endeavours and obedience;
   if you come not up to a thorough gospel-closure with this way of God;
   if you make it not your all, giving glory to God therein, -- perish you
   will, you must, and that to eternity. There remains no sacrifice for
   your sins, nor way of escape for your souls. You have not, then, only
   the excellency of this way to invite you, but the absolute,
   indispensable necessity of this way to enforce you. And now, let me add
   that I am glad this word is spoken, is written unto you. You and I must
   one day be accountable for this discourse. That word that hath already
   been spoken, if neglected, will prove a sore testimony against you. It
   will not fare with you as with other men who have not heard the joyful
   sound. All those words that shall be found consonant to the gospel, if
   they are not turned to grace in your hearts here, will turn into
   torment unto your souls hereafter. Choose not any other way; it will be
   in vain for you; it will not profit you. And take heed lest you suppose
   you embrace this way when indeed you do not; about which I have given
   caution before.

   4. This way is free and open for and unto sinners. He that fled to the
   city of refuge might well have many perplexed thoughts, whether he
   should find the gates of it opened unto him or no, and whether the
   avenger of blood might not overtake and slay him whilst he was calling
   for entrance. Or if the gates were always open, yet some crimes
   excluded men thence, Numb. xxxv. 16. It is not so here, Acts xiii. 38,
   39.

   This is the voice of God, even the Father: "Come," saith he, "to the
   marriage, for all things are prepared," -- no fear of want of
   entertainment, Matt. xxii. 4; whence the preachers of the gospel are
   said in his stead to beseech men to be reconciled, 2 Cor. v. 20. And

   It is the voice of the Son: "Whosoever," saith he, "cometh to God by
   me, I will in no wise cast out,'?" John vi. 37. Whoever he be that
   comes shall assuredly find entertainment. The same is his call and
   invitation in other places, as Matt. xi. 28; John vii. 37. And

   This is the voice of the Spirit, and of the church, and of all
   believers: Rev. xxii. 17, "The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let
   him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
   whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." All centre in
   this, that sinners may come freely to the grace of the gospel. And

   It is the known voice of the gospel itself, as Isa. lv. 1-3; Prov. ix.
   1-5. And

   It is the voice of all the saints in heaven and earth, who have been
   made partakers of forgiveness; they all testify that they received it
   freely.

   Some, indeed, endeavour to abuse this concurrent testimony of God and
   man. What is spoken of the freedom of the grace of God, they would
   wrest to the power of the will of man; but the riches and freedom of
   God's mercy do not in the least interfere with the efficacy of his
   grace. Though he proclaim pardon in the blood of Christ indefinitely,
   according to the fulness and excellency of it, yet he giveth out his
   quickening grace to enable men to receive it as he pleaseth; for he
   hath mercy on whom he will have mercy. But this lies in the thing
   itself; the way is opened and prepared, and it is not because men
   cannot enter, but because they will not, that they do not enter. As our
   Saviour Christ tells the Pharisees, "Ye therefore hear not God's word,
   because ye are not of God," John viii. 47, vi. 44; so he doth, "Ye will
   not come to me that ye might have life," John v. 40. In the neglect and
   inadvertency of the most excusable, there is a positive act of their
   will put forth in the refusing of Christ and grace by him; and this is
   done by men under the preaching of the gospel every day. There is
   nothing that at the last day will tend more immediately to the
   advancement of the glory of God, in the inexcusableness of them who
   obey not the gospel, than this, that terms of peace, in the blessed way
   of forgiveness, were freely tendered unto them. Some that hear or read
   this word may perhaps have lived long under the dispensation of the
   word of grace, and yet it may be have never once seriously pondered on
   this way of coming to God by forgiveness through the blood of Christ,
   but think that going to heaven is a thing of course, that men need not
   much trouble themselves about. Do they know what they have done?
   Hitherto, all their days, they have positively refused the salvation
   that hath been freely tendered unto them in Jesus Christ. Not they,
   they will say; they never had such a thought, nor would for all this
   world. But be it known unto you, inasmuch as you have not effectually
   received him, you have refused him; and whether your day and season be
   past or no, the Lord only knows.

   5. This way is safe. No soul ever miscarried in it. There is none in
   heaven but will say it is a safe way; there is none in hell can say
   otherwise. It is safe to all that venture on it so as to enter into it.
   In the old way we were to preserve ourselves and the way; this
   preserves itself and us. This will be made evident by the ensuing
   considerations --

   (1.) This is the way which, in the wisdom, care, and love of God in
   Christ, was provided in the room of another, removed and taken out of
   the way for this cause and reason, because it was not safe nor could
   bring us unto God: Heb. viii. 7, 8, "For if the first covenant had been
   faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second. But
   finding fault with them, he saith," etc. And, --

   [1.] He tells us that the first covenant was not faultless; for if it
   bad, there would have been no need of a second. The "commandment,"
   indeed, which was the matter of that covenant, the same apostle informs
   us to be "holy, and just, and good," Rom. vii. 12. But this was faulty
   as to all ends of a covenant, considering our state and condition as
   sinners; it could not bring us unto God. So he acquaints us, chap.
   viii. 3, "It was weak through the flesh," -- that is, by the entrance
   of sin, -- and so became unuseful as to the saving of souls. Be it so,
   then: through our sin and default this good and holy law, this
   covenant, was made unprofitable unto us; but what was that unto God?
   was he bound to desert his own institution and appointment, because
   through our own default it ceased to be profitable unto us? Not at all.
   He might righteously have tied us all unto the terms of that covenant,
   to stand or fall by them unto eternity; but he would not do so. But, --

   [2.] In his love and grace he "finds fault with it," Heb. viii. 8; not
   in itself and absolutely, but only so far as that he would provide
   another way, which should supply all its defects and wants in reference
   to the end aimed at. What way that is the apostle declares in the
   following verses to the end of that chapter. The sum is, verse 12, "I
   will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their
   iniquities will I remember no more." It is the way of pardon and
   forgiveness. This is substituted in the room of that insufficient way
   that was removed.

   Let us consider, then, whether the infinitely wise and holy God,
   pursuing his purpose of bringing souls unto himself, -- laying aside
   one way of his own appointment as useless and infirm, because of the
   coming in of sin, against which there was no relief found in it, and
   substituting another way in the room of it, -- would not provide such a
   one as should be absolutely free from the faults and inconveniences
   which he charged upon that which he did remove. That which alone
   rendered the former way faulty was sin; it could do any thing but save
   a sinner. This, then, was to be, and is, principally provided against
   in this way of forgiveness. And we see here how clearly God hath
   severed, yea, and in this matter opposed, these two things, -- namely,
   the way of personal righteousness and the way of forgiveness. He finds
   fault with the first. What then doth he do? what course doth he take?
   Doth he mend it, take from it what seems to be redundant, mitigate its
   severity, and supply it where it was wanting by forgiveness, and so set
   it up anew? This, indeed, is the way that many proceed in their
   notions, and the most in their practice; but this is not the way of
   God. He takes the one utterly away, and establishes the other in its
   place. And men's endeavours to mix them will be found of little use to
   them at the last. I can have no great expectation from that which God
   pronounced faulty.

   (2.) The unchangeable principles and foundations that this way is built
   upon render it secure and safe for sinners; for, --

   [1.] It is founded on the purpose of God: Gal. iii. 8, "The Scripture
   foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith." God would
   do so; he had purposed and determined to proceed this way; and all the
   purposes of God are attended with immutability. And, --

   [2.] His promise also is engaged in it, and that given out in the way
   of a covenant, as hath been already declared. And, --

   [3.] This promise is confirmed by an oath; and it may be observed, that
   God doth not in any filing interpose with an oath, but what relates to
   this way of coming to himself by forgiveness; for the oath of God,
   wherever it is used, respecteth either Christ typically or personally,
   or the covenant established in him; for, --

   [4.] This way is confirmed and ratified in his blood; from whence the
   apostle at large evinceth its absolute security and safety, Heb. ix.
   Whatever soul, on the invitation under consideration, shall give up
   himself to come to God by the way proposed, he shall assuredly find
   absolute peace and security in it. Neither our own weakness or folly
   from within, nor the opposition of any or all our enemies from without,
   shall be able to turn us out of this way. See Isa. xxxv. 4-10.

   (3.) In the other way, every individual person stands upon his own
   bottom, and must do so to the last and utmost of his continuance in
   this world. You are desirous to go unto God, to obtain his favour, and
   come to an enjoyment of him. What will you do, what course will you fix
   upon, for the obtaining of these ends? If you were so holy, so perfect,
   so righteous, so free from sin as you could desire, you should have
   some boldness in going unto God. Why, if this be the way you fix upon,
   take this along with you: You stand upon your own personal account all
   your days: and if you fail in the least, you are gone for ever; "for
   whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is
   guilty of all," James ii. 10. And what peace can you possibly obtain,
   were you as holy as ever you aimed or desired to be, whilst this is
   your condition? But in this way of forgiveness we all shalt stand upon
   the account of one common Mediator, in whom we are "complete," Col. ii.
   10. And a want of a due improvement of this truth is a great principle
   of disconsolation to many souls. Suppose a man look upon himself as
   loosed from the covenant of works, wherein exact and perfect
   righteousness is rigidly required, and to be called unto gospel,
   evangelical obedience, to be performed in the room thereof in sincerity
   and integrity; yet if he be not cleared in this also, that he stands
   not in this way purely on his own account, he will never be able to
   make his comforts hold out to the end of his journey. There will be
   found in the best of men so many particular failings, as will seem in
   difficult seasons to impeach their integrity; and so many questionings
   will after arise, through the darkness of their minds and power of
   their temptations, as will give but little rest unto their souls. Here
   lies the great security of this way, -- we abide in it on the account
   of the faithfulness and ability of our common Mediator, Jesus Christ

   And this is another consideration, strengthening our invitation to a
   closure with the way of coming unto God under proposal. There is
   nothing wanting that is needful to give infallible security to any soul
   that shall venture himself into it and upon it. There are terms of
   peace proposed, as you have heard. These terms are excellent, and holy,
   and chosen of God, tending to the interest of his glory; -- free, safe,
   and secure unto sinners. What hath any soul in the world to object
   against them? or wherein do men repose their trust and confidence in
   the neglect of this so great salvation? Is it in their lusts and sins,
   that they will yield them as much satisfaction and contentment as they
   shall need to desire? Alas! they will ruin them, and bring forth
   nothing but death. Is it in the world? It will deceive them; the figure
   of it passeth away. Is it in their duties and righteousness? They will
   not relieve them; for, did they follow the law of righteousness, they
   could not obtain the righteousness of the law. Is it in the continuance
   of their lives? Alas! it is but a shadow, "a vapour that appeareth for
   a little while." Is it in a future amendment and repentance? Hell is
   full of souls perishing under such resolutions. Only this way of pardon
   remains; and yet of all others is most despised! But yet I have one
   consideration more to add before I farther enforce the exhortation.

   6. Consider that this is the only way and means to enable you unto
   obedience, and to render what you do therein acceptable unto God. It
   may be that some of you are under the power of convictions, and have
   made engagements unto God to live unto him, to keep yourselves from
   sin, and to follow after holiness. It may be you have done so in
   afflictions, dangers, sicknesses, or upon receipt of mercies But yet
   you find that you cannot come unto stability or constancy in your
   course, -- you break with God and your own souls; which fills you with
   new disquietments, or else hardens you and makes you secure and
   negligent, so that you return unto your purposes no oftener than your
   convictions or afflictions befall you anew. This condition is ruinous
   and pernicious, which nothing clan deliver you from but this closing
   with forgiveness; for, --

   (1.) All that you do without this, however it may please your minds or
   ease your consciences, is not at all accepted with God. Unless this
   foundation be laid, all that you do is lost; -- all your prayers, all
   your duties, all your amendments, are an abomination unto the Lord.
   Until peace is made with him, they are but the acts of enemies, which
   he despiseth and abhorreth. You run, it may be earnestly, but you run
   out of the way; you strive, but not lawfully, and shall never receive
   the crown. True gospel obedience is the fruit of the faith of
   forgiveness. Whatever you do without it is but a building without a
   foundation, a castle in the air. You may see the order of gospel
   obedience, Eph. ii. 7-10. The foundation must be laid in grace, riches
   of grace by Christ, -- in the free pardon and forgiveness of sin. From
   hence must the works of obedience proceed, if you would have them to he
   of God's appointment, or find acceptance with him. Without this God
   will say of all your services, worship, obedience, as he did to the
   Israelites of old, Amos v. 21-23, "I despise all, reject it all." It is
   not to him nor to his glory. Now, if you are under convictions of any
   sort, there is nothing you more value, nothing you more place your
   confidence in, than your duties, your repentance, your amendment, what
   you do, and what in good time you will be. Is it nothing unto you to
   lose all your hopes and all your expectations which you have from
   hence; to have no other reception with God than if all this while you
   had been wallowing in your sins and lusts? Yet thus it is with you. If
   you have not begun with God on his own terms, if you have not received
   the atonement in the blood of his Son, if you are not made partakers of
   forgiveness, if your persons are not pardoned, all your duties are
   accursed.

   (2.) This alone will give you such motives and encouragements unto
   obedience as will give you life, alacrity, and delight in it. You
   perform duties, abstain from sins, but with heaviness, fear, and in
   bondage. Could you do as well without them as with them, would
   conscience be quiet, and hope of eternity hold out, you would omit them
   for ever. This makes all your obedience burdensome, and you cry out in
   your thoughts with him in the prophet, "Behold, what a weariness is
   it!" The service of God is the only drudgery of your lives, which you
   dare not omit, and delight not to perform. From this wretched and
   cursed frame there is nothing can deliver you but this closing with
   forgiveness. This will give you such motives, such encouragements, as
   will greatly influence your hearts and souls. It will give you freedom,
   liberty, delight, and cheerfulness, in all duties of gospel obedience.
   You will find a constraining power in the love of Christ therein, -- a
   freedom from bondage, when the Son truly hath made you free. Faith and
   love will work genuinely and naturally in your spirits; and that which
   was your greatest burden will become your chiefest joy, 2 Cor. vii. 1.
   Thoughts of the love of God, of the blood of Christ, or of the covenant
   of grace, and sense of pardon in them, will enlarge your hearts and
   sweeten all your duties. You will find a new life, a new pleasure, a
   new satisfaction, in all that you do. Have you yet ever understood that
   of the wise man, Prov. iii. 17, "Wisdom's ways are ways of
   pleasantness, and all her path s are peace?" Have the ways of holiness,
   of obedience, of duties, been so unto you? Whatever you pretend, they
   are not, they cannot be so, whilst you are strangers unto that which
   alone can render them so unto you. I speak unto them that are under the
   law. Would you be free from that bondage, that galling yoke in duties
   of obedience? would you have all that you do towards God a delight and
   pleasantness unto you? This, and this alone, will effect it for you.

   (3.) This will place all your obedience upon a sure foot of account in
   your own souls and consciences, even the same that is fixed on in the
   gospel. For the present, all that you do is indeed but to compound with
   God for your sin. You hope, by what you do for him and to him, to buy
   off what you have done against him, that you may not fall into the
   hands of his wrath and vengeance. This makes all you do to be irksome.
   As a man that labours all his days to pay an old debt, and brings in
   nothing to lay up for himself, how tedious and wearisome is his work
   and labour to him! It is odds but that, at one time or other, he will
   give over and run away from his creditor. So it is in this case: men
   who have secret reserves of recompensing God by their obedience, every
   day find their debt growing upon them, and have every day less hopes of
   making a satisfactory payment. This makes them weary, and for the most
   part they faint under their discouragements, and at length they fly
   wholly from God. This way alone will state things otherwise in your
   consciences: it will give you to see that all your debts are paid by
   Christ, and freely forgiven unto you by God; so that what you do is of
   gratitude or thankfulness, hath an influence into eternity, leads to
   the glory of God, the honour of Christ in the gospel, and your own
   comfortable account at the last day. This encourageth the soul to
   labour, to trade, to endeavour; all things now looking forward, and
   unto his advantage.

   (4.) Find you not in yourselves an impotency, a disability unto the
   duties of obedience, as to their performance unto God in an acceptable
   manner? It may be you are not so sensible hereof as you ought to be;
   for, respecting only or principally the outward part and performance of
   duties, you have not experience of your own weakness. How to enliven
   and fill up duties with faith, love, and delight, you know not; and are
   therefore unacquainted with your own insufficiency in this matter. Yet
   if you have any light, any convictions (and to such I speak at
   present), you cannot but perceive and understand that you are not able
   in your obedience to answer what you aim at; you have not strength or
   power for it. Now it is this faith of forgiveness alone that will
   furnish you with the ability whereof you stand in need. Pardon comes
   not to the soul alone, or rather, Christ comes not to the soul with
   pardon only; it is that which he opens the door and enters by, but he
   comes with a Spirit of life and power. And as "without him we can do
   nothing," so through his enabling us we may "do all things." Receiving
   of gospel forgiveness engageth all the grace of the gospel unto our
   assistance.

   This is the sum of what hath been spoken -- The obedience that you
   perform under your convictions is burdensome and unpleasant unto you;
   it is altogether unacceptable to God. You lose all you do, and all that
   you hope to do hereafter, if the foundation be not laid in the
   receiving of pardon in the blood of Christ. It is high time to cast
   down all that vain and imaginary fabric which you have been erecting,
   and to go about the laying of a new foundation, which you may safely
   and cheerfully build upon, -- a building that will abide for ever.

   7. Again: it is such a way, so excellent, so precious, so near the
   heart of God, so relating to the blood of Christ, that the neglect of
   it will assuredly be sorely revenged of the Lord. Let not men think
   that they shall despise the wisdom and love of the Father, the blood of
   the Son, and the promises of the gospel, at an easy rate. Let us in a
   very few words take a view of what the Holy Ghost speaks to this
   purpose. There are three ways whereby the vengeance due to the neglect
   of closing with forgiveness or gospel grace is expressed:--

   (1.) That is done positively: "He that believeth not shall be damned,"
   Mark xvi. 16. That is a hard word; many men cannot endure to hear of
   it. They would not have it named by their good wills, and are ready to
   fly in the face of him from whose mouth it proceeds. But let not men
   deceive themselves; this is the softest word that mercy and love
   itself, that Christ, that the gospel speaks to despisers of
   forgiveness. It is Christ who is this legal terrifying preacher; it is
   he that cries out, "If you believe not, you shall be damned;" and he
   will come himself "in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them that obey
   not the gospel," 2 Thess ii 8. This is the end of the disobedient, if
   God, if Christ, if the gospel may be believed.

   (2.) Comparatively, in reference unto the vengeance due to the breach
   of the law, 2 Cor. ii. 16. We are in the preaching of forgiveness by
   Christ, unto them that perish, "a savour of death unto death," a deep
   death, a sore Condemnation. So Heb. x. 29, "Of how much sorer
   punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy?" sorer than ever was
   threatened by the law, or inflicted for the breach of it, -- not as to
   the kind of punishment but as to the degrees of it; hence ariseth the
   addition of "Many stripes."

   (3.) By the way of admiration at the inexpressibleness and
   unavoidableness of the punishment due unto such sinners: Heb. ii. 3,
   "How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation!" -- "Surely
   there is no way for men to escape, they shall unavoidably perish, who
   neglect so great salvation." So the Holy Ghost says, 1 Pet. iv. 17,
   "What shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel?" -- "What
   understanding can reach to an apprehension of their miserable and woful
   condition?" "None can," saith the Holy Ghost, "nor can it be spoken to
   their capacity." Ah! what shall their end be? There remains nothing but
   "a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which
   shall devour the adversaries," Heb. x. 27, -- a certain fearful
   expectation of astonishable things, that cannot be comprehended.
     __________________________________________________________________

   And these are the enforcements of the exhortation in hand which I shall
   insist upon. On these foundations, on the consideration of these
   principles, let us now a little confer together, with the words of
   truth and sobriety. I speak to such poor souls as, having deceived
   themselves, or neglected utterly their eternal condition, are not as
   yet really and in truth made partakers of this forgiveness. Your
   present state is sad and deplorable. There is nothing but the woful
   uncertainty of a dying life between you and eternal ruin. That
   persuasion you have of forgiveness is good for nothing but to harden
   you and destroy you. It is not the forgiveness that is with God, nor
   have you taken it up on gospel grounds or evidences. You have stolen
   painted beads, and take yourselves to be lawful possessors of pearls
   and jewels. As you are, then, any way concerned in your own eternal
   condition, which you are entering into (and how soon you shall be
   engaged in it you know not), prevail with yourselves to attend a little
   unto the exhortation that lies before you; it is your own business that
   you are entreated to have regard unto.

   1. Consider seriously what it is you bottom your hopes and expectation
   upon as to eternity. Great men, and in other things wise, are here very
   apt to deceive themselves. They suppose they think and believe much
   otherwise than indeed they think and believe, as their cry at the last
   day will manifest. Put your souls a little unto it. Do you at all
   seriously think of these things? or are you so under the power of your
   lusts, ignorance, and darkness, that you neglect and despise them? or
   do you rise up and lie down, and perform some duties, or neglect them,
   with a great coldness, remissness, and indifferency of spirit, like
   Gallio, not much caring for these things? or do you relieve yourselves
   with hopes of future amendment, purposing that if you live you will be
   other persons than you are, when such and such things are brought about
   and accomplished? or do you not hope well in general upon the account
   of what you have done and will do? If any of these express your
   condition, it is unspeakably miserable. You lie down and rise up under
   the wrath of the great God, who will prevail at last upon you, and
   there shall be none to deliver.

   2. If you shall say, "Nay, this is not our state; we rely on mercy and
   forgiveness," then let me, in the fear of the great God, entreat a few
   things yet farther of you:--

   That you would seriously consider whether the forgiveness you rest on
   and hope in be that gospel forgiveness which we have before described;
   or is it only a general apprehension of impunity, though you are
   sinners, -- that God is merciful, and you hope in him that you shall
   escape the vengeance of hell-fire? If it be thus with you, forgiveness
   itself will not relieve you. This is that of the presumptuous man,
   Deut. xxix. 19. Gospel pardon is a thing of another nature; it hath its
   spring in the gracious heart of the Father, is made out by a sovereign
   act of his will, rendered consistent with the glory of his justice and
   holiness by the blood of Christ, by which it is purchased in a covenant
   of grace; as hath been showed. If you shall say, "Yea, this is the
   forgiveness we rely upon, it is that which you have described," then I
   desire farther that you would,

   (1.) Examine your own hearts, how you came to have an interest in this
   forgiveness, to close with it, and to have a right unto it. A man may
   deceive himself as effectually by supposing that true riches are his,
   when they are not, as by supposing his false and counterfeit ware to be
   good and current. How, then, came you to be interested in this gospel
   forgiveness? If it hath befallen you you know not how, -- if a
   lifeless, barren, inoperative persuasion of it hath crept upon your
   minds, -- be not mistaken, God will come and require his forgiveness at
   your hands, and it shall appear that you have had no part nor portion
   in it. If you shall say, "Nay, but we were convinced of sin, and
   rendered exceeding unquiet in our consciences, and on that account
   looked out after forgiveness, which hath given us rest," then I desire,
   --

   (2.) That you would diligently consider to what ends and purposes you
   have received, and do make use of, this gospel forgiveness. Hath it
   been to make up what was wanting, and to piece up a peace in your own
   consciences? that whereas you could not answer your convictions with
   your duties, you would seek for relief from forgiveness? This and
   innumerable other ways there are whereby men may lose their souls when
   they think all is well with them, even on the account of pardon and
   mercy. Whence is that caution of the apostle, "Looking diligently lest
   any one should seem to fall," or come short, "of the grace of God,"
   Heb. xii. 15. Men miss it and come short of it when they pretend
   themselves to be in the pursuit of it, yea, to have overtaken and
   possessed it. Now, if any of these should prove to be your condition, I
   desire, --

   (3) That you would consider seriously whether it be not high time for
   you to look out for a way of deliverance and escape, that you may save
   yourselves from this evil world, and flee from the wrath to come. The
   Judge stands at the door. Before he deal with you as a judge, he knocks
   with a tender of mercy. Who knows but that this may be the last time of
   his dealing thus with you. Be you old or young, you have but your
   season, but your day. It may, perhaps, be night with you when it is day
   with the rest of the world. Your sun may go down at noon; and God may
   swear that you shall not enter into his rest. If you are, then,
   resolved to continue in your present condition, I have no more to say
   unto you. I am pure from your blood, in that I have declared unto you
   the counsel of God in this thing; and so I must leave you to a naked
   trial between the great God and your souls at the last day. Poor
   creatures! I even tremble to think how he will tear you in pieces when
   there shall be none to deliver. Methinks I see your poor, destitute,
   forlorn souls, forsaken of lusts, sins, world, friends, angels, men,
   trembling before the throne of God, full of horror and fearful
   expectation of the dread fill sentence. Oh, that I could mourn over
   you, whilst you are joined to all the living, whilst there is but hope!
   oh, that in this your day you knew the things of your peace!

   But now if you shall say, "Nay, but we will seek the Lord whilst he may
   be found,' we will draw nigh unto him before he cause darkness," then,
   --

   (4.) Consider, I pray, what Joshua told the children of Israel, when
   they put themselves upon such a resolution, and cried out, "We will
   serve the Lord, for he is our God" chap. xxiv. 19, "Ye cannot serve the
   Lord: for he is an holy God, a jealous God; he will not forgive your
   transgressions nor your sins." Go to him upon your own account, and in
   your own strength, with your own best endeavours and duties, you will
   find him too great and too holy for you to deal withal. You will obtain
   neither acceptance of your persons nor pardon of your sins. But you
   will say, "This is heavy tidings, If you sit still you perish, and if
   you rise to be doing, it will not be better.' Is there no hope left for
   our souls? Must we pine away under our sins and the wrath of God for
   ever?" God forbid. There are yet other directions remaining to guide
   you out of these entanglements. Wherefore, --

   (5.) Ponder seriously on what hath been spoken of this way of
   approaching unto God. Consider it in its own nature, as to all the ends
   and purposes for which it is proposed of God; consider whether you
   approve of it or no. Do you judge it a way suited and fitted to bring
   glory unto God? Doth it answer all the wants and distresses of your
   souls? Do you think it excellent, safe, and glorious unto them who are
   entered into it? or have you any thing to object against it? Return
   your answer to him in whose name and by whose appointment these words
   are spoken unto you. If you shall say, "We are convinced that this way
   of forgiveness is the only way for the relief and deliverance of
   souls," then, --

   (6.) Abhor yourselves for all your blindness and obstinacy, whereby you
   have hitherto despised the love of God, the blood of Christ, and the
   tenders of pardon in the gospel. Be abased and humbled to the dust in a
   sense of your vileness, pollutions, and abominations; which things are
   every day spoken unto, and need not here be repeated. And, --

   (7.) Labour to exercise your hearts greatly with thoughts of that
   abundant grace that is manifested in this way of sinners coming unto
   God, as also of the excellency of the gospel wherein it is unfolded.
   Consider the eternal love of the Father, which is the fountain and
   spring of this whole dispensation, -- the inexpressible love of the Son
   in establishing and confirming it, in removing all hinderances and
   obstructions by his own blood, bringing forth unto beauty and glory
   this redemption or forgiveness of sin at the price of it. And let the
   glory of the gospel, which alone makes this discovery of forgiveness in
   God, dwell in your hearts. Let your minds be exercised about these
   things. You will find effects from them above all that hath as yet been
   brought forth in your souls. What, for the most part, have you hitherto
   been conversant about? When you have risen above the turmoiling of
   lusts and corruptions in your hearts, the entanglements of your
   callings, business, and affairs, what have you been able to raise your
   hearts unto? Perplexing fears about your condition, general hopes,
   without savour or relish, yielding you no refreshment, legal commands,
   bondage duties, distracted consciences, broken purposes and promises,
   which you have been tossed up and down withal, without any certain
   rest. And what effects have these thoughts produced? Have they made you
   more holy and more humble? Have they given you delight in God, and
   strength unto new obedience? Not at all. Where you were, there you
   still are, without the least progress. But now bring your souls unto
   these springs, and try the Lord if from that day you be not blessed
   with spiritual stores.

   (8.) If the Lord be pleased to carry on your souls thus far, then stir
   up yourselves to choose and close with the way of forgiveness that hath
   been revealed. Choose it only, choose it in comparison with and
   opposition unto all others. Say you will be for Christ, and not for
   another; and be so accordingly. Here venture, here repose, here rest
   your souls. It is a way of peace, safety, holiness, beauty, strength,
   power, liberty, and glory. You have the nature, the name, the love, the
   purposes, the promises, the covenant, the oath of God; the love, life,
   death or blood, the mediation, or oblation and intercession of Jesus
   Christ; the power and efficacy of the Spirit, and gospel grace by him
   administered, -- to give you assurance of the excellency, the oneness,
   the safety of the way whereunto you are engaging.

   If now the Lord shall be pleased to persuade your hearts and souls to
   enter upon the path marked out before you, and shall carry you on
   through the various exercises of it unto this closure of faith, God
   will have the glory, the gospel will be exalted, and your own souls
   shall reap the eternal benefit of this exhortation.

   But now if, notwithstanding all that hath been spoken, all the
   invitations you have had, and encouragements that have been held out
   unto you, you shall continue to despise this so great salvation, you
   will live and die in the state and condition wherein you are. Why,
   then, as the prophet said to the wife of Jeroboam, "Come near, for I am
   sent to you with heavy tidings." I say, then, --

   (9.) If you resolve to continue in the neglect of this salvation, and
   shall do so accordingly, then cursed be you of the Lord, with all the
   curses that are written in the law, and all the curses that are
   denounced against despisers of the gospel. Yea, be you Anathema
   Maranatha, -- cursed in this world always, until the coming of the
   Lord; and when the Lord comes, be ye cursed from his presence into
   everlasting destruction. Yea, curse them, all ye holy angels of God, as
   the obstinate enemies of your king and head, the Lord Jesus Christ.
   Curse them, all ye churches of Christ, as despisers of that love and
   mercy which is your portion, your life, your inheritance. Let all the
   saints of God, all that love the Lord, curse them, and rejoice to see
   the Lord coming forth mightily and prevailing against them, to their
   everlasting ruin. Why should any one have a thought of compassion
   towards them who despise the compassion of God, or of mercy towards
   them who trample on the blood of Christ? Whilst there is yet hope, we
   desire to have continual sorrow for you, and to travail in soul for
   your conversion to God; but if you be hardened in your way, shall we
   join with you against him? shall we prefer you above his glory? shall
   we desire your salvation with the despoiling God of his honour? Nay,
   God forbid. We hope to rejoice in seeing all that vengeance and
   indignation that is in the right hand of God poured out unto eternity
   upon your souls, Prov. i. 24-33.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Rules to be observed by them who would come to stability in obedience.

   That which remaineth to be farther carried on, upon the principles laid
   down, is to persuade with souls more or less entangled in the depths of
   sin to close with this forgiveness by believing, unto their peace and
   consolation. And because such persons are full of pleas and objections
   against themselves, I shall chiefly, in what I have to say, endeavour
   to obviate these objections, so to encourage them unto believing and
   bring them unto settlement. And herein whatever I have to offer flows
   naturally from the doctrine at large laid down and asserted. Yet I
   shall not in all particulars apply myself thereunto, but in general fix
   on those things that may tend to the establishment and consolation of
   both distressed and doubting souls. And I shall do what I purpose these
   two ways --

   First, I shall lay down such general rules as are necessary to be
   observed by all those who intend to come to gospel peace and comfort.
   And then, Secondly, shall consider some such objections as seem to be
   most comprehensive of those special reasonings wherewith distressed
   persons do usually entangle themselves.

   I shall begin with general rules, which, through the grace of Christ
   and supplies of his Spirit, may be of use unto believers in the
   condition under consideration.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule I.

   Christ the only infallible judge of our spiritual condition -- How he
   judgeth by his word and Spirit.

   Be not judges of your own condition, but let Christ judge. You are
   invited to take the comfort of this gospel truth, that "there is
   forgiveness with God." You say, not for you. So said Jacob, "My way is
   hid from the Lord," Isa. xl. 27; and Zion said so too, chap. xlix. 14,
   "The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me." But did
   they make a right judgment of themselves? We find in those places that
   God was otherwise minded. This false judgment, made by souls in their
   entanglements, of their own condition, is ofttimes a most unconquerable
   hinderance unto the bettering of it. They fill themselves with thoughts
   of their own about it, and on them they dwell, instead of looking out
   after a remedy. Misgiving thoughts of their distempers are commonly a
   great part of some men's sickness. Many diseases are apt to cloud the
   thoughts, and to cause misapprehensions concerning their own nature and
   danger. And these delusions are a real part of the person's sickness.
   Nature is no less impaired and weakened by them, the efficacy of
   remedies no less obstructed, than by any other real distemper. In such
   cases we persuade men to acquiesce in the judgment of their skilful
   physician; not always to be wasting themselves in and by their own
   tainted imaginations, and so despond upon their own mistakes, but to
   rest in what is informed them by him who is acquainted with the causes
   and tendency of their indisposition better than themselves. It is
   ofttimes one part of the soul's depths to have false apprehensions of
   its condition. Sin is a madness, Eccles. ix. 3; so far as any one is
   under the power of it, he is under the power of madness. Madness doth
   not sooner nor more effectually discover itself in any way or thing
   than in possessing them in whom it is with strange conceits and
   apprehensions of themselves. So doth this madness of sin, according
   unto its degrees and prevalency. Hence some cry, "Peace, peace," when
   "sudden destruction is at hand," 1 Thess. v. 3. It is that madness,
   under whose power they are, which gives them such groundless
   imaginations of themselves and their own condition. And some say they
   are lost for ever, when God is with them.

   Do you, then, your duty, and let Christ judge of your state. Your
   concernment is too great to make it a reasonable demand to commit the
   judgment of your condition to any other. When eternal welfare or woe
   are at the stake, for a man to renounce his own thoughts, to give up
   himself implicitly to the judgment of men fallible and liars like
   himself, is stupidity. But there is no danger of being deceived by the
   sentence of Christ. The truth is, whether we will or no, he will judge;
   and according as he determines, so shall things be found at the last
   day: John v. 22, "The Father judgeth no man" (that is, immediately and
   in his own person), "but hath committed all judgment unto the Son." All
   judgment that respects eternity, whether it be to be passed in this
   world or in that to come, is committed unto him. Accordingly in that
   place he judgeth both of things and persons. Things he determines upon,
   verse 24, "He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me,
   hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is
   passed from death unto life." Let men say what they please, this
   sentence shall stand; faith and eternal life are inseparably conjoined.
   And so of persons, verse 38, "Ye have not" (saith he to the Pharisees,
   who were much otherwise minded) "the word of God abiding in you."

   Take not, then, the office and prerogative of Christ out of his hand,
   by making a judgment, upon your own reasonings and conclusions and
   deductions, of your estate and condition. You will find that he
   oftentimes, both on the one hand and on the other, determines quite
   contrary to what men judge of themselves, as also to what others judge
   of them. Some he judgeth to be in an evil condition, who are very
   confident that it is well with them, and who please themselves in the
   thoughts of many to the same purpose. And he judgeth the state of some
   to be good, who are diffident in themselves, and, it may be, despised
   by others. We may single out an example or two in each kind --

   1. Laodicea's judgment of herself and her spiritual state we have, Rev.
   iii. 17: "I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of
   nothing." A fair state it seems, a blessed condition! She wants nothing
   that may contribute to her rest, peace, and reputation: she is
   orthodox, and numerous, and flourishing; makes a fair profession, and
   all is well within! So she believes, so she reports of herself; wherein
   there is a secret reflection also upon others whom she despiseth: "Let
   them shift as they list, I am thus as I say." But was it so with her
   indeed? was that her true condition, whereof she was so persuaded as to
   profess it unto all? Let Jesus Christ be heard to speak in this cause,
   let him come and judge. "I will do so," saith he: verse 14, "Thus saith
   the Amen, the faithful and true Witness." Coming to give sentence in a
   case of this importance, he gives himself this title, that we may know
   his word is to be acquiesced in. "Every man," saith he, "is a liar;
   their testimony is of no value, let them pronounce what they win of
   themselves or of one another, I am the Amen,' and I will see whose word
   shall stand, mine or theirs." What, then, saith he of Laodicea? "Thou
   art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked." Oh, woful
   and sad disappointment! Oh, dreadful surprisal! Ah! how many Laodicean
   churches have we in the world! how many professors are members of these
   churches! not to mention the generality of men that live under the
   means of grace; all which have good hopes of their eternal condition,
   whilst they are despised and abhorred by the only Judge. Among
   professors themselves, it is dreadful to think how many will be found
   light when they come to be weighed in this balance.

   2. Again: he judgeth some to be in a good condition, be they themselves
   never so diffident. Rev. ii. 9, saith he to the church of Smyrna, "I
   know thy poverty." Smyrna was complaining that she was a poor,
   contemptible congregation, not fit for him to take any notice of.
   "Well," saith he, "fear not. I know thy poverty,' whereof thou
   complainest; but thou art rich.' That is my judgment, testimony, and
   sentence, concerning thee and thy condition." Such will be his judgment
   at the last day, when both those on the one hand and on the other shall
   be surprised with his sentence, -- the one with joy at the riches of
   his grace, the other with terror at the severity of his justice, Matt.
   xxv. 37-40, 44, 45. This case is directly stated in both the places
   mentioned in the entrance of this discourse; as in that, for instance,
   Isa. xlix. 14, "Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me." That is Zion's
   judgment of herself, and her state and condition; a sad report and
   conclusion. But doth Christ agree with Zion in this sentence? The next
   verse gives us his resolution of this matter: "Can," saith he, "a woman
   forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the
   son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee." The
   state of things, in truth, is as much otherwise as can possibly be
   thought or imagined.

   To what purpose is it for men to be passing a judgment upon themselves,
   when there is no manner of certainty in their determinations, and when
   their proceeding thereon will probably lead them to farther
   entanglements, if not to eternal ruin? The judging of souls, as to
   their spiritual state and condition, is the work of Jesus Christ,
   especially as to the end now under inquiry. Men may, men do, take many
   ways to make a judgment of themselves. Some do it on slight and trivial
   conjectures; some on bold and wicked presumptions; some on desperate
   atheistical notions, as Deut. xxix. 19; some, with more sobriety and
   sense of eternity, lay down principles that may be good and true in
   themselves, from them they draw conclusions, arguing from one thing
   unto another, and in the end ofttimes either deceive themselves, or sit
   down no less in the dark than they were at the entrance of their
   self-debate and examination. A man's judgment upon his own reasonings
   is seldom true, more seldom permanent. I speak not of self-examination,
   with a due discussion of graces and actions, but of the final sentence
   as to state and condition, wherein the soul is to acquiesce. This
   belongs unto Christ.

   Now, there are two ways whereby the Lord Jesus Christ gives forth his
   decretory sentence in this matter --

   (1.) By his word. He determines, in the word of the gospel, of the
   state and condition of all men indefinitely. Each individual coming to
   that word receives his own sentence and doom. He told the Jews that
   Moses accused them, John v. 45. His law accused and condemned the
   transgressors of it. And so doth he acquit every one that is discharged
   by the word of the gospel And our self-judging is but our receiving by
   faith his sentence in the word. His process herein we have recorded:
   Job xxxiii. 22, 23, "His soul" (that is, of the sinner) "draweth near
   unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers." This seems to be his
   state; it is so indeed: he is at the very brink of the grave and hell.
   What then? Why, if there be with him or stand over him ml'k mlyts?, the
   angel interpreting, or the angel of the covenant, who alone is 'chd
   mny'lph?, the "one of a thousand," what shall he dot "He shall shew
   unto him his uprightness." He shall give unto him a right determination
   of his interest in God, and of the state and frame of his heart towards
   God; whereupon God shall speak peace unto his soul, and deliver him
   from his entanglements, verse 24. Jesus Christ hath, in the word of the
   gospel, stated the condition of every man. He tells us that sinners, of
   what sort soever they are, that believe, are accepted with him, and
   shall receive forgiveness from God, -- that none shall be refused or
   cast off that come unto God by him. The soul of whom we are treating is
   now upon the work of coming unto God for forgiveness by Jesus Christ.
   Many and weighty objections it hath in and against itself why it should
   not come, why it shall not be accepted. Our Lord Jesus, the wisdom of
   God, foresaw all these objections, he foreknew what could be said in
   the case, and yet he hath determined the matter as hath been declared.
   In general, men's arguings against themselves arise from sin and the
   law. Christ knows what is in them both. He tried them to the uttermost,
   as to their penalties, and yet he hath so determined as we have showed.
   Their particular objections are from particular considerations of sin,
   their greatness, their number, their aggravations. Christ knows all
   these also, and yet stands to his former determination. Upon the whole
   matter, then, it is meet his word should stand. I know, when a soul
   brings itself to be judged by the word of the gospel, it doth not
   always in a like manner receive and rest in the sentence given. But
   when Christ is pleased to speak the word with power to men, they shall
   "hear the voice of the Son of God," and be concluded by it. Let the
   soul, then, that is rising out of depths and pressing towards a sense
   of forgiveness, lay itself down before the word of Christ in the
   gospel. Let him attend to what he speaks; and if for a while it hath
   not power upon him to quiet his heart, let him wait a season, and light
   shall arise unto him out of darkness. Christ will give in his sentence
   into his conscience with that power and efficacy as he shall find rest
   and peace in it.

   (2.) Christ also judgeth by his Spirit, not only in making this
   sentence of the gospel to be received effectually in the soul, but in
   and by peculiar actings of his upon the heart and soul of a believer: 1
   Cor. ii 12, "We have received the Spirit which is of God, that we might
   know the things that are freely given to us of God." The Spirit of
   Christ acquaints the soul that this and that grace is from him, that
   this or that duty was performed in his strength. He brings to mind what
   at such and such times was wrought in men by himself, to give them
   supportment and relief in the times of depths and darkness. And when it
   hath been clearly discovered unto the soul at any time by the Holy
   Ghost, that any thing wrought in it or done by it hath been truly
   saving, the comfort of it will abide in the midst of many shakings and
   temptations.

   3. He also by his Spirit bears witness with our spirits as to our state
   and condition. Of this I have spoken largely elsewhere, and therefore
   shall now pass it by.

   This, then, is our first general rule and direction --
   Self-determinations concerning men's spiritual state and condition,
   because their minds are usually influenced by their distempers, are
   seldom right and according to rule; mistakes in such determinations are
   exceedingly prejudicial to a soul seeking out after relief and sense of
   forgiveness: let Christ, then, be the judge in this case by his word
   and Spirit, as bath been directed.

  Rule II.

   Self-condemnation and abhorrency for sin consistent with gospel
   justification and peace -- The nature of gospel assurance -- What is
   consistent with it -- What are the effects of it.

   Self-condemnation and abhorrency do very well consist with gospel
   justification and peace. Some men have no peace, because they have that
   without which it is impossible they should have peace. Because they
   cannot but condemn themselves, they cannot entertain a sense that God
   doth acquit them. But this is the mystery of the gospel, which unbelief
   is a stranger unto; nothing but faith can give a real subsistence unto
   these things in the same soul, at the same time. It is easy to learn
   the notion of it, but it is not easy to experience the power of it. For
   a man to have a sight of that within him which would condemn him, for
   which he is troubled, and at the same time to have a discovery of that
   without him which will justify him, and to rejoice therein, is that
   which be is not led unto but by faith in the mystery of the gospel. We
   are now under a law for justification which excludes all boasting, Rom.
   iii. 27; so that though we have joy enough in another, yet we may have,
   we always have, sufficient cause of humiliation in ourselves. The
   gospel will teach a man to feel sin and believe righteousness at the
   same time. Faith will carry heaven in one hand and hell in the other;
   showing the one deserved, the other purchased. A man may see enough of
   his own sin and folly to bring "gehennam Ã¨ coelo," -- a hell of wrath
   out of heaven; and yet see Christ bring "coelum ex inferno," -- a
   heaven of blessedness out of a hell of punishment. And these must needs
   produce very divers, yea, contrary effects and operations in the soul;
   and be who knows not how to assign them their proper duties and seasons
   must needs be perplexed. The work of self-condemnation, then, which men
   in these depths cannot but abound with, is, in the disposition of the
   covenant of grace, no way inconsistent with nor unsuited unto
   justification and the enjoyment of peace in the sense of it. There may
   be a deep sense of sin on other considerations besides hell. David was
   never more humbled for sin than when Nathan told him it was forgiven.
   And there may be a view of hell as deserved, which yet the soul may
   know itself freed from as to the issue.

   To evidence our intendment in this discourse, I shall briefly consider
   what we intend by gospel assurance of forgiveness, that the soul may
   not be solicitous and perplexed about the utter want of that which,
   perhaps, it is already in some enjoyment of.

   Some men seem to place gospel assurance in a high, unassaulted
   confidence of acceptance with God. They think it is in none but such
   as, if a man should go to them and ask them, "Are you certain you shall
   be saved?" have boldness, and confidence, and ostentation to answer
   presently, "Yea, they are certain they shall be saved." But as the
   blessed truth of assurance hath been reproached in the world under such
   a notion of it, so such expressions become not them who know what it is
   to have to do with the holy God, who is "a consuming fire." Hence some
   conclude that there are very few believers who have any assurance,
   because they have not this confidence, or are more free to mention the
   opposition they meet with than the supportment they enjoy. And thus it
   is rendered a matter not greatly to be desired, because it is so rarely
   to be obtained, most of the saints serving God and going to heaven well
   enough without it. But the matter is otherwise. The importance of it,
   not only as it is our life of comfort and joy, but also as it is the
   principal means of the flourishing of our life of holiness, hath been
   declared before, and might be farther manifested, were that our present
   business; yea, and in times of trial, which are the proper seasons for
   the effectual working and manifestation of assurance, it will and doth
   appear that many, yea, that most of the saints of God are made
   partakers of this grace and privilege.

   I shall, then, in the pursuit of the rule laid down, do these two
   things -- 1. Show what things they are which are not only consistent
   with assurance, but are even necessary concommitants of it; which yet,
   if not duly weighed and considered, may seem so far to impeach a man's
   comfortable persuasion of his condition before God as to leave him
   beneath the assurance sought after. And, -- 2. I shall speak somewhat
   of its nature, especially as manifesting itself by its effects.

   1. (1.) A deep sense of the evil of sin, of the guilt of man's own sin,
   is no way inconsistent with gospel assurance of acceptance with God
   through Christ, and of forgiveness in him. By a sense of the guilt of
   sin I understand two things -- First, A clear conviction of sin, by the
   Holy Ghost saying unto the soul, "Thou art the man;" and, Secondly, A
   sense of the displeasure of God, or the wrath due to sin, according to
   the sentence of the law. Both these David expresseth in that complaint,
   Ps. xxxi. 10, "My life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing:
   my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are
   consumed." His iniquity was before him, and a sense of it pressed him
   sore. But yet, notwithstanding all this, he had a comfortable
   persuasion that God was his God in covenant: verse 14, "I trusted in
   thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God." And the tenor of the covenant,
   wherein alone God is the God of any person, is, that he will be
   merciful unto their sin and iniquity. To whom he is a God, he is so
   according to the tenor of that covenant; so that here these two are
   conjoined. Saith he, "Lord, I am pressed with the sense of the guilt of
   mine iniquities; and thou art my God, who forgivest them." And the
   ground hereof is, that God by the gospel hath divided the work of the
   law, and taken part of it out of its hand. Its whole work and duty is,
   to condemn the sin and the sinner. The sinner is freed by the gospel,
   but its right lies against the sin still; that it condemns, and that
   justly. Now, though the sinner himself be freed, yet finding his sin
   laid hold of and condemned, it fills him with a deep sense of its guilt
   and of the displeasure of God against it; which yet hinders not but
   that, at the same time, he may have such an insight as faith gives into
   his personal interest in a gospel acquitment. A man, then, may have a
   deep sense of sin all his days, walk under the sense of it continually,
   abhor himself for his ingratitude, unbelief, and rebellion against God,
   without any impeachment of his assurance.

   (2.) Deep sorrow for sin is consistent with assurance of forgiveness;
   yea, it is a great means of preservation of it. Godly sorrow, mourning,
   humiliation, contriteness of spirit, are no less gospel graces and
   fruits of the Holy Ghost than faith itself, and so are consistent with
   the highest flourishings of faith whatever. It is the work of heaven
   itself, and not of the assurance of it, to wipe all tears from our
   eyes. Yea, these graces have the most eminent promises annexed to them,
   as Isa. lvii. 15, lxvi. 2, with blessedness itself, Matt. v. 4; yea,
   they are themselves the matter of many gracious gospel promises, Zech.
   xii. 10: so that they are assuredly consistent with any other grace or
   privilege that we may be made partakers of, or [any that] are promised
   unto us. Some, finding the weight and burden of their sins, and being
   called to mourning and humiliation on that account, are so taken up
   with it as to lose the sense of forgiveness, which, rightly improved,
   would promote their sorrow, as their sorrow seems directly to sweeten
   their sense of forgiveness. Sorrow, absolutely exclusive of the faith
   of forgiveness, is legal, and tendeth unto death; assurance, absolutely
   exclusive of godly sorrow, is presumption, and not a persuasion from
   Him that calleth us: but gospel sorrow and gospel assurance may well
   dwell in the same breast at the same time. Indeed, as in all worldly
   joys there is a secret wound, so in all godly sorrow and mourning,
   considered in itself, there is a secret joy and refreshment; hence it
   doth not wither and dry up, but rather enlarge, open, and sweeten the
   heart. I am persuaded that, generally, they mourn most who have most
   assurance. And all true gospel mourners will be found to have the root
   of assurance so grafted in them, that in its proper season, -- a time
   of trouble, -- it will undoubtedly flourish.

   (3.) A deep sense of the indwelling power of sin is consistent with
   gospel assurance. Sense of indwelling sin will cause manifold
   perplexities in the soul. Trouble, disquietments, sorrow and anguish of
   heart, expressing themselves in sighs, mourning, groaning for
   deliverance, always attend it. To what purpose do you speak to a soul
   highly sensible of the restless power of indwelling sin concerning
   assurance? "Alas," saith he, "I am ready to perish every moment. My
   lusts are strong, active, restless, yea, outrageous; they give me no
   rest, no liberty, and but little success do I obtain. Assurance is for
   conquerors, for them that live at rest and peace. I lie grovelling on
   the ground all my days, and must needs be uncertain what will be the
   issue." But when such a one hath done all he can, he will not be able
   to make more woful complaints of this matter than Paul hath done before
   him, Rom. vii.; and yet he closeth the discourse of it with as high an
   expression of assurance as any person needs to seek after, verse 25,
   and chap. viii. 1. It is not assurance but enjoyment that excludes this
   sense and trouble. But if men will think they can have no assurance
   because they have that without which it is impossible they should have
   any, it is hard to give them relief. A little cruse of salt of the
   gospel cast into these bitter waters will make them sweet and
   wholesome. Sense of the guilt of sin may consist with faith of its
   pardon and forgiveness in the blood of Christ. Godly sorrow may dwell
   in the same heart, at the same time, with joy in the Holy Ghost, and
   groaning after deliverance from the power of sin with a gracious
   persuasion that "sin shall not have dominion over us, because we are
   not under the law, but under grace."

   (4.) Doubtings, fears, temptations, if not ordinarily prevailing, are
   consistent with gospel assurance. Though the devil's power be limited
   in reference unto the saints, yet his hands are not tied; though he
   cannot prevail against them, yet he can assault them. And although
   there be not "an evil heart of unbelief" in believers, yet there will
   still be unbelief in their hearts. Such an evidence, conviction, and
   persuasion of acceptance with God as are exclusive of all contrary
   reasonings, that suffer the soul to hear nothing of objections, that
   free and quiet it from all assaults, are neither mentioned in the
   Scripture, nor consistent with that state wherein we walk before God,
   nor possible on the account of Satan's will and ability to tempt, or of
   our own remaining unbelief. Assurance encourageth us in our combat; it
   delivereth us not from it. We may have peace with God when we have none
   from the assaults of Satan.

   Now, unless a man do duly consider the tenor of the covenant wherein we
   walk with God, and the nature of that gospel obedience which he
   requires at our hands, with the state and condition which is our lot
   and portion whilst we live in this world, the daily sense of these
   things, with the trouble that must be undergone on their account, may
   keep him in the dark unto himself, and hinder him from that
   establishment in believing which otherwise he might attain unto. On
   this account, some as holy persons as any in this world, being wholly
   taken up with the consideration of these home-bred perplexities, and
   not clearly acquainted with the way and tenor of assuring their souls
   before God according to the rule of the covenant of grace, have passed
   away their days in a bondage-frame of spirit, and unacquaintance with
   that strong consolation which God is abundantly willing that all the
   heirs of promise should receive.

   2. Evangelical assurance is not a thing that consisteth in any point,
   and so incapable of variation. It may be higher or lower, greater or
   less, obscure or attended with more evidence. It is not quite lost when
   it is not quite at its highest. God sometimes marvellously raiseth the
   souls of his saints with some close and near approaches unto them, --
   gives them a sense of his eternal love, a taste of the embraces of his
   Son and the inhabitation of the Spirit, without the least intervening
   disturbance; then this is their assurance. But this life is not a
   season to be always taking wages in; our work is not yet done; we are
   not always to abide in this mount; we must down again into the battle,
   -- fight again, cry again, complain again. Shah the soul be thought now
   to have lost its assurance? Not at all. It had before assurance with
   joy, triumph, and exultation; it hath it now, or may have, with
   wrestling, cries, tears, and supplications. And a man's assurance may
   be as good, as true, when he lies on the earth with a sense of sin, as
   when he is carried up to the third heaven with a sense of love and
   foretaste of glory. In brief, this assurance of salvation is such a
   gracious, evangelical persuasion of acceptance with God in Christ, and
   of an interest in the premises of preservation unto the end, wrought in
   believers by the Holy Ghost, in and through the exercise of faith, as
   for the most part produceth these effects following:--

   (1.) It gives delight in obedience, and draws out love in the duties
   that unto God we do perform. So much assurance of a comfortable issue
   of their obedience, of a blessed end of their labours and duties, of
   their purifying their hearts, and pressing after universal renovation
   of mind and life, as may make them cheerful in them, as may give love
   and delight in the pursuit of what they are engaged in, is needful for
   the saints, and they do not often go without it; and where this is,
   there is gospel assurance. To run as men uncertain, to fight as those
   that beat the air, to travel as not any way persuaded of a comfortable
   entertainment or refreshment at the journey's end, is a state and
   condition that God doth not frequently leave his people unto; and when
   he doth, it is a season wherein he receives very little of glory from
   them, and they very little increase of grace in themselves. Many
   things, as hath been showed, do interpose, -- many doubts arise and
   entangling perplexities; but still there is a comfortable persuasion
   kept alive that there is a rest provided, which makes them willing
   unto, and cheerful in, their most difficult duties. This prevaileth in
   them, that their labour in the Lord, their watchings, praying,
   suffering, alms, mortification, fighting against temptation, crucifying
   the flesh with the lusts thereof, shall not be in vain. This gives them
   such a delight in their most difficult duties as men have in a hard
   journey towards a desirable home or a place of rest.

   (2.) It casts out fear, tormenting fear, such as fills the soul with
   perplexing uncertainties, hard thoughts of God, and dreadful
   apprehensions of wrath to come. There are three things spoken
   concerning that fear which is inconsistent with the assurance of
   forgiveness -- First, With respect unto its principle, it is from a
   "spirit of bondage:" Rom. viii. 15, "We have not received the spirit of
   bondage again to fear." It is not such a fear as makes an occasional
   incursion upon the mind or soul, such as is excited and occasioned by
   incident darkness and temptation, such as the best, and persons of the
   highest assurance, are liable and obnoxious unto; but it is such as
   hath a complete abiding principle in the soul, even a "spirit of
   bondage," -- a prevailing frame constantly inclining it to fear, or
   dreadful apprehensions of God and its own condition. Secondly, That it
   tends to bondage. It brings the soul into bondage: Heb. ii. 14, 15, he
   died "to deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime
   subject to bondage." Fear of death as penal, as it lies in the curse,
   which is that fear that proceeds from a" spirit of bondage," brings the
   persons in whom it is into bondage; that is, it adds weariness,
   trouble, and anxiety of mind unto fear, and puts them upon all ways and
   means imaginable, unduly and disorderly, to seek for a remedy or
   relief. Thirdly, It hath torment: "Fear hath torment," 1 John iv. 18.
   It gives no rest, no quietness, unto the mind. Now, this is so cast out
   by gospel assurance of forgiveness, that, though it may assault the
   soul, it shall not possess it; though it make incursions upon it, it
   shall not dwell, abide, and prevail in it.

   (3.) It gives the soul a hope and expectation of "the glory that shall
   be revealed," and secretly stirs it up and enlivens it unto a
   supportment in sufferings, trials, and temptations. This is the "hope
   which maketh not ashamed," Rom. v. 5, and that because it will never
   expose the soul unto disappointment. Wherever there is the root of
   assurance, there will be this fruit of hope. The proper object of it is
   things absent, invisible, eternal, -- the promised reward, in all the
   notions, respects, and concernments of it. This hope goes out unto, in
   distresses, temptations, failings, and under a sense of the guilt and
   power of sire Hence ariseth a spring of secret relief in the soul,
   something that calms the heart and quiets the spirit in the midst of
   many a storm. Now, as, wherever assurance is, there will be this hope;
   so wherever this secret relieving hope is, it grows on no other root
   but a living persuasion of a personal interest in the things hoped for.

   (4.) As it will do many other things, so, that I may give one
   comprehensive instance, it will carry them out, in whom it is, to die
   for Christ. Death, unto men who saw not one step beyond it, was
   esteemed of all things most terrible. The way and means of its approach
   add unto its terror. But this is nothing in comparison of what it is
   unto them who look through it as a passage into ensuing eternity. For a
   man, then, to choose death rather than life, in the most terrible
   manner of its approach, expecting an eternity to ensue, it argues a
   comfortable persuasion of a good state and condition after death. Now,
   I am persuaded that there are hundreds who, upon gospel, saving
   accounts, would embrace a stake for the testimony of Jesus, who yet
   know not at all that they have the assurance we speak of; and yet
   nothing else would enable them thereunto. But these things being beside
   the main of my intendment, I shall pursue them no farther; only, the
   rule is of use -- Let the soul be sure to be well acquainted with the
   nature of that which it seeks after, and confesseth a sense of the want
   of.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule III.

   Continuance in waiting necessary unto peace and consolation.

   Whatever your condition be, and your apprehension of it, yet continue
   waiting for a better issue, and give not over through weariness or
   impatience. This rule contains the sum of the great example given us in
   this psalm. Forgiveness in God being discovered, though no sense of a
   particular interest therein as yet obtained, that which the soul
   applies itself unto is diligent, careful, constant, persevering
   waiting; which is variously expressed in the fifth and sixth verses.
   The Holy Ghost tells us that "light is sown for the righteous, and
   gladness for the upright in heart," Ps. xcvii. 11. Light and gladness
   are the things now inquired after. Deliverance from darkness,
   misapprehensions of God, hard and misgiving thoughts of his own
   condition, is that which a soul in its depths reacheth towards. Now,
   saith the Holy Ghost, "These things are sown for the righteous." Doth
   the husbandman, after he casts his seed into the earth, immediately the
   next day, the next week, expect that it will be harvest? doth he think
   to reap so soon as he hath sown? or doth he immediately say, "I have
   laboured in vain, here is no return; I will pull up the hedge of this
   field and lay it waste?" or, "I see a little grass in the blade, but no
   corn; I will give it to the beasts to devour it?" No; "his God," as the
   prophet speaks, "doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him,"
   -- namely, what he must do, and how he must look for things in their
   season. And shall not we be instructed by him? "Behold, the
   husbandman," saith James, "waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth,
   and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter
   rain," James v. 7. And is light sown for them that are in darkness, and
   shall they stifle the seed under the clods, or spoil the tender blade
   that is springing up, or refuse to wait for the watering of the Spirit,
   that may bring it forth to perfection? Waiting is the only way to
   establishment and assurance; we cannot speed by our haste; yea, nothing
   puts the end so far away as making too much haste and speed in our
   journey. The ground hereof is, that a sense of a special interest in
   forgiveness and acceptance is given in to the soul by a mere act of
   sovereignty. It is not, it will not be, obtained by or upon any
   rational conclusions or deductions that we can make. All that we can do
   is but to apply ourselves to the removal of hinderances, for the peace
   and rest sought for come from mere prerogative: "When he giveth
   quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who
   then can behold him?" Job xxxiv. 29. Now, what is the way to receive
   that which comes from mere sovereignty and prerogative? Doth not the
   nature of the thing require humble waiting? If, then, either impatience
   cast the soul into frowardness, or weariness make it slothful (which
   are the two ways whereby waiting is ruined), let not such a one expect
   any comfortable issue of his contending for deliverance out of his
   depths. And let not any think to make out their difficulties any other
   way: their own reasonings will not bring them to any establishing
   conclusion; for they may lay down propositions, and have no
   considerable objections to lie against either of them, and yet be far
   enough from that sweet consolation, joy, and assurance which is the
   product of the conclusion, when God is not pleased to give it in. Yea,
   a man may sometimes gather up consolation to himself upon such terms,
   but it will not abide. So did David, Ps. xxx. 6, 7. He thus argues with
   himself: "He whose mountain is made strong, to whom God is a defence,
   he shall never be moved nor be shaken; but I am thus settled of God:
   therefore I shall not be moved." And therein he rejoiceth. It is an
   expression of exultation that he useth; but what is the issue of it? In
   the midst of these pleasing thoughts of his, "God hides his face," and
   "he is troubled;" he cannot any longer draw out the sweetness of the
   conclusion mentioned. It was in him before from the shinings of God's
   countenance, and not from any arguings of his own.

   No disappointment, then, no tediousness or weariness, should make the
   soul leave waiting on God, if it intend to attain consolation and
   establishment. So dealeth the church, Lam. iii. 21, "This I recall to
   mind, therefore have I hope." What is that she calls to mind? This,
   that "it is of the Lord's mercy that we are not consumed, because his
   compassions fail not," verse 22; -- "I will yet hope, I will yet
   continue in my expectation upon the account of never-failing
   compassion, of endless mercies in him, whatever my present condition
   be." And thence she makes a blessed conclusion, verse 26, "It is good
   that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the
   Lord." And this is our third rule:-- It is good to hope and wait,
   whatever our present condition be, and not to give over, if we would
   not be sure to fall; whereunto I speak no more, because the close of
   this psalm insists wholly on this duty, which must be farther spoken
   unto.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule IV.

   Remove the hinderances of believing by a searching out of sin -- Rules
   and directions for that duty.

   Seeing, in the course of our believing and obedience, that which is
   chiefly incumbent on us, for our coming up to establishment and
   consolation, is spiritual diligence in the removal of the hinderances
   thereof, let the soul that would attain thereunto make thorough work in
   the search of sin, even to the sins of youth, that all scores on that
   account may clearly be wiped out. If there be much rubbish left in the
   foundation of the building, no wonder if it always shake and totter.
   Men's leaving of any sin unsearched to the bottom will poison all their
   consolation. David knew this when, in dealing with God in his
   distresses, he prays that he would not" remember the sins and
   transgressions of his youth," Ps. xxv. 7. Youth is oftentimes a time of
   great vanity and unmindfulness of God; many stains and spots are
   therein usually brought upon the consciences of men. "Childhood and
   youth are vanity," Eccles. xi. 10; not because they soon pass away, but
   because they are usually spent in vanity, as the following advice of
   chap. xii. 1, to remember God in those days, doth manifest The way of
   many is to wear such things out of mind, and not to walk in a sense of
   their folly and madness, -- never to make thorough work with God about
   them. I speak of the saints themselves; for with others that live under
   the means of grace, whom God intends any way to make useful and
   industrious in their generation, this is the usual course -- by
   convictions, restraining grace, afflictions, love of employment and
   repute, God gives them another heart than they had for a season;
   another heart, but not a new heart. Hence, another course of life,
   another profession, other actions than formerly, do flow. With this
   change they do content themselves; they look on what is past perhaps
   with delight, or as things fit enough for those days, but not for those
   they have attained unto. Here they rest; and therefore never come to
   rest,

   But I speak of the saints themselves, who make not such thorough, full,
   close work in this kind as they ought. An after-reckoning may come in
   on this hand to their own disturbance, and an unconquerable hinderance
   of their peace and settlement be brought in, on this account. So was it
   with Job, chap. xiii. 26, "He maketh me to possess the iniquities of my
   youth." God filled his heart, his thoughts, his mind, with these sins,
   -- made them abide with him, so that he possessed them; they were
   always present with him. He made the sins of his youth the sufferings
   of his age. And it is a sad thing, as one speaks, when young sins and
   old bones meet together; as Zophar, chap. xx. 11, "His bones are full
   of the sins of his youth." The joyous frame of some men's youth makes
   way for sad work in their age. Take heed, young ones! you are doing
   that which will abide with you to age, if not to eternity. This
   possessing of the sins of youth, Job calls the "writing of bitter
   things against him;" as, indeed, it is impossible but that sin should
   be bitter one time or other. God calls it "a root that beareth gall and
   wormwood," Deut. xxix. 18; "a root of bitterness springing up into
   defilement," Heb. xii. 15. This, then, is to be searched out to the
   bottom. Israel will not have success nor peace whilst there is an Achan
   in the camp. Neither success in temptation nor consolation in believing
   is to be expected, whilst any Achan, any sin unreckoned for, lies on
   the conscience.

   Now, for them who would seriously accomplish a diligent search in this
   matter, which is of such importance unto them, let them take these two
   directions --

   1. Let them go over the consideration of those sins, and others of the
   like nature, which may be reduced unto the same general heads with
   them, which we laid down before as the sins which generally cast men
   into depths and entanglements. And if they find they have contracted
   the guilt of any of them, let them not think it strange that they are
   yet bewildered in their condition, and do come short of a refreshing
   sense of peace with God or an interest in forgiveness. Rather let them
   admire the riches of patience, grace, and forbearance, that they are
   not cast utterly out of all hopes of a recovery. This will speed an end
   unto their trouble, according to the direction given.

   2. Let them cast the course of their times under such heads and seasons
   as may give them the more clear and distinct view and apprehension of
   the passages in them between God and their souls which may have been
   provoking unto him.

   As, first, for the state of their inward man, let them consider, --

   (1.) The unregenerate part of their lives, that which was confessedly
   so, before they had any real work of God upon their hearts; and therein
   inquire after two things -- First, If there were then any great and
   signal eruptions of sins against God; for of such God requires that a
   deep sense be kept on our souls all our days. How often do we find Paul
   calling over the sins of his life and ways before his conversion! "I
   was," saith he, "injurious, and a blasphemer." Such reflections ought
   persons to have on any great provoking occasions of sin, that may keep
   them humble, and necessitate them constantly to look for a fresh sense
   of pardon through the blood of Christ. If such sins lie neglected, and
   not considered according to their importance, they will weaken the soul
   in its comforts whilst it lives in this world. Secondly, If there were
   any signal intimations made of the good-will and love of God to the
   soul, which it broke off from through the power of its corruption and
   temptation, they require a due humbling consideration all our days. But
   this hath been before spoken unto.

   (2.) In that part of our lives which, upon the call of God, we have
   given up unto him, there are two sorts of sins that do effectually
   impeach our future peace and comfort; which ought therefore to be
   frequently reviewed and issued in the blood of Christ -- First, Such
   as, by reason of any aggravating circumstances, have been accompanied
   with some especial unkindness towards God. Such are sins after
   warnings, communications of a sense of love, after particular
   engagements against them, relapses, omissions of great opportunities
   and advantages for the furtherance of the glory of God in the world.
   These kinds of sins have much unkindness attending them, and will be
   searched out if we cover them. Secondly, Sins attended with scandal
   towards fewer or more, or any one single person who is or may be
   concerned in us. The aggravations of these kinds of sins are commonly
   known.

   (3.) The various outward states and conditions which we have passed
   through, as of prosperity and afflictions, should in like manner fall
   under this search and consideration. It is but seldom that we fill up
   our duty or answer the mind of God in any dispensation of providence,
   and if our neglect herein be not managed aright, they will undoubtedly
   hinder and interrupt our peace.

  Rule V.

   The fifth rule -- Distinction between unbelief and jealousy.

   Learn to distinguish between unbelief and jealousy.

   There is a twofold unbelief:-- 1. That which is universal and
   privative, such as is in all unregenerate persons; they have no faith
   at all, -- that is, they are dead men, and have no principles of
   spiritual life. This I speak not of; it is easily distinguished from
   any grace, being the utter enemy and privation as it were of them all.
   2. There is an unbelief partial and negative, consisting in a
   staggering at or questioning of the promises. This is displeasing to
   God, a sin which is attended with unknown aggravations, though men
   usually indulge it in themselves It is well expressed, Ps. lxxviii. 19,
   20. God had promised his presence to the people in the wilderness to
   feed, sustain, and preserve them. How did they entertain these promises
   of God? "Can he," say they, "give bread? can he provide flesh for his
   people?" verse 20. What great sin, crime, or offence is in this
   inquiry? Why, verse 19, this is called speaking against God: "They
   spake against God; they said, Can he furnish a table in the
   wilderness?" Unbelief in question of the promises is a "speaking
   against God;" a "limiting of the Holy One of Israel," as it is called,
   verse 41; an assigning of bounds to his goodness, power, kindness, and
   grace, according to what we find in ourselves, which he abhors. By this
   unbelief we make God like ourselves; that is, our limiting of him,
   expecting no more from him than either we can do, or see how it may be
   done. This, you will say, was a great sin in the Israelites, because
   they had no reason to doubt or question the promises of God. It is well
   we think so now; but when they were so many thousand families, that had
   not one bit of bread nor drop of water aforehand for themselves and
   their little ones, there is no doubt but they thought themselves to
   have as good reason to question the promises as any one of you can
   think that you have. We are ready to suppose that we have all the
   reasons in the world: every one supposeth he hath those that are more
   cogent than any other hath to question the promises of grace, pardon,
   and forgiveness; and therefore the questioning of them is not their
   sin, but their duty. But pretend what we will, this is speaking against
   God, limiting of him; and that which is our keeping off from
   steadfastness and comfort.

   But now there may be a jealousy in a gracious heart concerning the love
   of Christ, which is acceptable unto him, at least which he is tender
   towards, that may be mistaken for this questioning of the promises by
   unbelief, and so help to keep the soul in darkness and disconsolation.
   This the spouse expresseth in herself: Cant. viii. 6, "Love is strong
   as death; jealousy is hard as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of
   fire, which hath a most vehement flame." Love is the foundation, the
   root; but yet it bears that fruit which is bitter, although it be
   wholesome, -- that which fills the soul with great perplexities, and
   makes it cry out for a nearer and more secure admission into the
   presence of Christ. "Set me," saith the spouse, "as a seal upon thine
   heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for jealousy is cruel as the grave;"
   -- "I cannot bear this distance from thee, these fears of my being
   disregarded by thee. Set me as a seal upon thine heart.'?"

   Now, this spiritual jealousy is the solicitousness of the mind of a
   believer, who hath a sincere love for Christ, about the heart,
   affection, and good-will of Christ towards it, arising from a
   consciousness of its own unworthiness to be beloved by him or accepted
   with him. All causeless jealousy ariseth from a secret sense and
   conviction of unworthiness in the person in whom it is, and a high
   esteem of him that is the object of it, or concerning whose love and
   affection any one is jealous. So it is with this spiritual jealousy.
   The root of it is love, sincere love, that cannot be "quenched by
   waters" nor "drowned by floods," verse 7, -- which nothing can utterly
   prevail against or overcome. This gives the soul high thoughts of the
   glorious excellencies of Christ, fills it with admiration of him; these
   are mixed with a due sense of its own baseness, vileness, and
   unworthiness to be owned by him or accepted with him. Now, if these
   thoughts, on the one hand and on the other, be not directed, guided,
   and managed aright by faith, -- which alone can show the soul how the
   glory of Christ consisteth principally in this, that he, being so
   excellent and glorious, is pleased to love us with love inexpressible
   who are vile and sinful, -- questionings about the love of Christ, and
   those attended with much anxiety and trouble of mind, will arise. Now,
   this frame may some -- times be taken for a questioning of the promises
   of God, and that to be a defect in faith which is an excess of love, or
   at most such an irregular acting of it as the Lord Christ will be very
   tender towards, and which is consistent with peace and a due sense of
   the forgiveness of sins. Mistake not, then, these one for another, lest
   much causeless unquietness ensue in the judgment which you are to make
   of yourselves.

   But you will say, "How shall we distinguish between these two, so as
   not causelessly to he disquieted and perplexed?" I answer briefly, --

   1. Unbelief, working in and by the questioning of the promises of God,
   is a weakening, disheartening, dispiriting thing. It takes off the edge
   of the soul from spiritual duties, and weakens it both as unto delight
   and strength. The more any one questions the promises of God, the less
   life, power, joy, and delight in obedience he hath; for faith is the
   spring and root of all other graces, and according as that thriveth or
   goeth backwards so do they all. Men think sometimes that their
   uncertainty of the love of God, and of acceptance with him by the
   forgiveness of sin, doth put them upon the performance of many duties;
   and they can have no rest or peace in the omission of them. It may be
   it is so; yea, this is the state and condition with many. But what are
   these duties? and how are they performed? and what is their acceptance
   with God? The duties themselves are legal; which denomination ariseth
   not from the nature, substance, or matter of them, for they may be the
   same that are required and enjoined in the gospel, but from the
   principle from whence they proceed and the end to which they are used.
   Now these in this case are both legal; their principle is legal fear,
   and their end is legal righteousness, -- the whole attendance unto them
   a "seeking of righteousness as it were by the works of the law." And
   how are they performed? Plainly, with a bondage-frame of spirit,
   without love, joy, liberty, or delight. To quiet conscience, to pacify
   God, are the things in them aimed at, all in opposition to the blood
   and righteousness of Christ. And are they accepted with God? Let them
   be multiplied never so much, he everywhere testifieth that they are
   abhorred by him. This, then, unbelief mixed with convictions will do.
   It is the proper way of venting and exercising itself where the soul is
   brought under the power of conviction. But as unto gospel obedience, in
   all the duties of it, to he carried on in communion with God by Christ
   and delight in him, all questioning of the promises weakens and
   discourageth the soul, and makes them all wearisome and burdensome unto
   it.

   But the jealousy that is exercised about the person and love of Christ
   unto the soul is quite of another nature, and produceth other effects.
   It cheers, enlivens, and enlargeth the soul, stirs up to activity,
   earnestness, and industry in its inquiries and desires after Christ.
   "Jealousy," saith the spouse," is hard as the grave;' therefore, set me
   as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm.'?" It makes the
   soul restlessly pant after nearer, more sensible, and more assured
   communion with Christ; it stirs up vigorous and active spirits in all
   duties Every doubt and fear that it ingenerates concerning the love of
   Christ stirs up the soul unto more earnestness after him, delight in
   him, and sedulous watching against every thing that may keep it at a
   distance from him, or occasion him to hide, withdraw, or absent himself
   from it.

   2. Unbelief, that works by questioning of the promises, is universally
   selfish; it begins and ends in self. Self-love, in desires after
   freedom from guilt, danger, and punishment, is the life and soul of it.
   May this end be attained, it hath no delight in God; nor doth it care
   what way it be attained, so it may be attained. May such persons have
   any persuasions that they shall be freed from death and hell, be it by
   the works of the law or by the observance of any inventions of their
   own, whether any glory ariseth unto God from his grace and faithfulness
   or no, they are not solicitous.

   The jealousy we speak of hath the person of Christ and his excellency
   for its constant object. These it fills the mind with in many and
   various thoughts, still representing him more and more amiable and more
   desirable unto the soul: so doth the spouse upon the like occasion, as
   you may see at large, Cant. v. 9-16. Being at some loss for his
   presence, for he had withdrawn himself, not finding her wonted
   communion and intercourse with him, fearing that, upon her provocation,
   she might forfeit her interest in his love, she falls upon the
   consideration of all his excellencies; and thereby the more inflames
   herself into desires after his company and enjoyment. All these diverse
   things may be thus distinguished and discerned.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule VI.

   Distinction between faith and spiritual sense.

   Learn to distinguish between faith and spiritual sense.

   This rule the apostle gives us, 2 Cor. v. 7, "We walk by faith, and not
   by sight." It is the sight of glory that is especially here intended.
   But faith and sense in any kind are clearly distinguished. That may be
   believed which is not felt; yea, it is the will and command of God that
   faith should stand and do its work where all sense fails, Isa. l. 10.
   And it is with spiritual sense in this matter as it is with natural.
   Thomas would not believe unless he saw the object of his faith with his
   eyes, or felt it with his hand. But saith our Saviour, "Blessed are
   they that have not seen, and yet believe," -- who believe upon the
   testimony of God, without the help of their own sense or reason. And if
   we will believe no more of God, of his love, of his grace, of our
   acceptance with him, than we have a spiritual affecting sense of, we
   shall be many times at a loss. Sensible impressions from God's love are
   great springs of joy; but they are not absolutely necessary unto peace,
   nor unto an evidence that we do believe.

   We will deal thus with the vilest person living, -- we will believe him
   whilst we have the certainty of our sense to secure us. And if we deal
   so with God, what's there in our so doing praiseworthy? The prophet
   tells us what it is to believe in respect of providence, Hab. iii. 17.
   When there is nothing left outward and visible to support us, then to
   rest quietly on God, that is to believe: so Ps. lxxiii. 26. And the
   apostle, in the example of Abraham, shows us what it is to believe with
   respect unto a special promise: Rom. iv. 18, "Against hope, he believed
   in hope." When he saw not any outward ordinary means for the
   accomplishment of the promise, when innumerable objections arose
   against any such hope as might have respect unto such means, yet he
   resolved all his thoughts into the faithfulness of God in the promise,
   and therein raised a new hope in its accomplishment; so in hope
   believing against hope.

   To clear this matter, you must observe what I intend by this spiritual
   sense, which you must learn to distinguish faith from, and to know that
   true faith interesting the soul in forgiveness may be without it; that
   so you may not conclude unto a real want of pardon from the want of the
   refreshing sense of it.

   Grace in general may be referred unto two heads -- 1. Our acceptation
   with God through Christ, the same upon the matter with the forgiveness
   of sin that we are treating of; and, 2. Grace of sanctification from
   God in Christ. Of each of these there is a spiritual sense or
   experience to be obtained, in both distinguished from faith that gives
   us a real interest in forgiveness

   1. Of the first, or the spiritual sense that we have of acceptance with
   God, there are sundry parts or degrees; as, first, hereunto belongs
   peace with God: Rom. v. 1, "Being justified by faith, we have peace
   with God." This peace is the rest and composure of the soul emerging
   out of troubles, upon the account of the reconciliation and friendship
   made for it by the blood of Christ. And it hath, as all peace hath, two
   parts, -- first, a freedom from war, trouble, and distress; and,
   secondly, rest, satisfaction, and contentment in the condition
   attained; -- and this, at least the second part of it, belongs unto the
   spiritual sense that we inquire after. Again: there is in it "joy in
   the Holy Ghost," called "joy unspeakable, and full of glory," 1 Pet. i.
   8; as also "glorying in the Lord" upon the account of his grace, Isa.
   xlv. 9. 5; with many the like effects, proceeding from a "shedding
   abroad of the love of God in our hearts," Rom. v. 5.

   Yea, you say, these are the things you aim at; these are the things you
   would attain, and be filled withal. It is this peace, this joy, this
   glorying in the Lord, that you would always be in the possession of. I
   say, you do well to desire them, to seek and labour after them, -- they
   are purchased by Christ for believers; but you will do well to consider
   under what notion you do desire them. If you look on these things as
   belonging to the essence of faith, without which you can have no real
   interest in forgiveness or acceptance with God, you greatly deceive
   your own souls, and put yourselves out of the way of obtaining of them.
   These things are not believing, nor adequate effects of it, so as
   immediately to be produced wherever faith is; but they are such
   consequents of it as may or may not ensue upon it, according to the
   will of God. Faith is a seed that contains them virtually, and out of
   which they may be in due time educed by the working of the word and
   Spirit; and the way for any soul to be made partaker of them is to wait
   on the sovereignty of God's grace, who createth peace in the exercise
   of faith upon the promises. He, then, that would place believing in
   these things, and will not be persuaded that he doth believe until he
   is possessed of them, he doth both lose the benefit, advantage, and
   comfort of what he hath, and, neglecting the due acting of faith, puts
   himself out of the way of attaining what he aimeth at.

   These things, therefore, are not needful to give you a real saving
   interest in forgiveness, as it is tendered in the promise of the gospel
   by the blood of Christ. And it may be it is not the will of God that
   ever you should be intrusted with them. It may be it would not be for
   your good and advantage so to be. Some servants that are ill husbands
   must have their wages kept for them to the year's end, or it will do
   them no good. It may be, some would be such spendthrifts of satisfying
   peace and joy, and be so diverted by them from attending unto some
   necessary duties, -- as of humiliation, mortification, and
   self-abasement, without which their souls cannot live, -- that it would
   not be much to their advantage to be intrusted with them. It is from
   the same care and love that peace and joy are detained from some
   believers, and granted unto others.

   You are therefore to receive forgiveness by a pure act of believing, in
   the way and manner before at large described. And do not think that it
   is not in you unless you have constantly a spiritual sense of it in
   your hearts. See, in the meantime, that your faith bringeth forth
   obedience, and God in due time will cause it to bring forth peace.

   2. The like may be said concerning the other head of grace, though it
   be not so direct unto our purpose, yet tending also to the relief of
   the soul in its depths. This is the grace that we have from God in
   Christ for our sanctification. When the soul cannot find this in
   himself; when he hath not a spiritual sense and experience of its
   inbeing and power; when it cannot evidently distinguish it from that
   which is not fight or genuine, -- it is filled with fears and
   perplexities, and thinks it is yet in its sin. He is so, indeed, who
   hath no grace in him; but not he always who can find none in him. But
   these are different things. A man may have grace, and yet not have it
   at sometimes much acting; he may have grace for life, when he hath it
   not for fruitfulness and comfort, though it be his duty so to have it,
   Rev. iii. 2; 2 Tim. i. 6. And a man may have grace acting in him, and
   yet not know, not be sensible, that he hath acting grace. We see
   persons frequently under great temptations of apprehension that they
   have no grace at all, and yet at the same time, to the clearest
   conviction of all who are able to discern spiritual things, sweetly and
   genuinely to act faith, love, submission unto God, and that in a high
   and eminent manner. Ps. lxxxviii., Heman complains that he was "free
   among the dead," "a man of no strength," verses 4, 5, -- as one that
   had no spiritual life, no grace. This afflicted his mind, and almost
   distracted him, verse 15; and yet there can be no greater expressions
   of faith and love to God than are mixed with his complaints.

   These things, I say then, are not to be judged of by spiritual sense,
   but we are to live by faith about them. And no soul ought to conclude,
   that because it hath not the one it hath not the other, -- that because
   it hath not joy and peace, it hath no interest in pardon and
   forgiveness.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule VII.

   The seventh rule -- Mix not foundation and building work together.

   Mix not too much foundation and building work together. Our foundation
   in dealing with God is Christ alone, mere grace and pardon in him.

   Our building is in and by holiness and obedience, as the fruits of that
   faith by which we have received the atonement. And great mistakes there
   are in this matter, which bring great entanglements on the souls of
   men. Some are all their days laying of the foundation, and are never
   able to build upon it unto any comfort to themselves or usefulness unto
   others; and the reason is, because they will be mixing with the
   foundation stones that are fit only for the following building. They
   will be bringing their obedience, duties, mortification of sin, and the
   like, unto the foundation. These are precious stones to build with, but
   unmeet to be first laid, to bear upon them the whole weight of the
   building. The foundation is to be laid, as was said, in mere grace,
   mercy, pardon in the blood of Christ. This the soul is to accept of and
   to rest in merely as it is grace, without the consideration of any
   thing in itself, but that it is sinful and obnoxious unto ruin. This it
   finds a difficulty in, and would gladly have something of its own to
   mix with it. It cannot tell how to fix these foundation-stones without
   some cement of its own endeavours and duty; and because these things
   will not mix, they spend a fruitless labour about it all their days.
   But if the foundation be of grace, it is not at all of works; for
   "otherwise grace is no more grace." If any thing of our own be mixed
   with grace in this matter, it utterly destroys the nature of grace;
   which if it be not alone, it is not at all. But doth this not tend to
   licentiousness? doth not this render obedience, holiness, duties,
   mortification of sin, and good works needless? God forbid; yea, this is
   the only way to order them aright unto the glory of God. Have we
   nothing to do but to lay the foundation? Yes; all our days we are to
   build upon it, when it is surely and firmly laid. And these are the
   means and ways of our edification. This, then, is the soul to do who
   would come to peace and settlement -- Let it let go all former
   endeavours, if it have been engaged unto any of that kind, and let it
   alone receive, admit of, and adhere to, mere grace, mercy, and pardon,
   with a full sense that in itself it hath nothing for which it should
   have an interest in them, but that all is of mere grace through Jesus
   Christ: "Other foundation can no man lay." Depart not hence until this
   work be well over. Surcease not an earnest endeavour with your own
   hearts to acquiesce in this righteousness of God, and to bring your
   souls unto a comfortable persuasion that "God for Christ's sake hath
   freely forgiven you all your sins." Stir not hence until this be
   effected. If you have been engaged in another way, -- that is, to seek
   for an interest in the pardon of sin by some endeavours of your own, --
   it is not unlikely but that you are filled with the fruit of your own
   doings; that is, that you go on with all kinds of uncertainties, and
   without any kind of constant peace. Return, then, again hither; bring
   this foundation-work to a blessed issue in the blood of Christ; and
   when that is done, up and be doing.

   You know how fatal and ruinous it is for souls to abuse the grace of
   God and the apprehension of the pardon of sins in the course of their
   obedience, -- to countenance themselves in sin or the negligence of any
   duty; this is to turn the grace of God into wantonness, as we have
   elsewhere at large declared. And it is no less pernicious to bring the
   duties of our obedience, any reserves for them, any hopes about them,
   into the matter of pardon and forgiveness, as we are to receive them
   from God. But these things, as they are distinct in themselves, so they
   must be distinctly managed in the soul; and the confounding of them is
   that which disturbs the peace and weakens the obedience of many. In a
   confused manner they labour to keep up a life of grace and duty; which
   will be in their places conjoined, but not mixed or compounded.

   First, to take up mercy, pardon, and forgiveness absolutely on the
   account of Christ, and then to yield all obedience in the strength of
   Christ and for the love of Christ, is the life of a believer, Eph. ii.
   8-10.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule VIII.

   The eighth rule -- Spend not time in heartless complaints,

   Take heed of spending time in complaints when vigorous actings of grace
   are your duty.

   Fruitless and heartless complaints, bemoanings of themselves and their
   condition, is the substance of the profession that some make. If they
   can object against themselves, and form complaints out of their
   conditions, they suppose they have done their duty. I have known some
   who have spent a good part of their time in going up and down from one
   to another with their objections and complaints. These things are
   contrary to the life of faith. It is good, indeed, in our spiritual
   distresses, to apply ourselves unto them who are furnished with the
   tongue of the learned, to know how to speak a word in season unto him
   that is weary; but for persons to fill their minds and imaginations
   with their own objections and complaints, not endeavouring to mix the
   words that are spoken for their relief and direction with faith, but
   going on still in their own way, this is of no use or advantage. And
   yet some, I fear, may please themselves in such course, as if it had
   somewhat of eminency in religion in it.

   Others, it may be, drive the same trade in their thoughts, although
   they make not outwardly such complaints. They are conversant, for the
   most part, with heartless despondings. And in some they are multiplied
   by their natural constitutions or distempers. Examples of this kind
   occur unto us every day. Now, what is the advantage of these things?
   What did Zion get when she cried, "The Lord hath forsaken me, and my
   Lord hath forgotten me?" or Jacob, when he said, "My way is hid from
   the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God?" Doubtless they
   did prejudice themselves. How doth David rouse up himself when he found
   his mind inclinable unto such a frame? for having said, "Why dost thou
   cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
   he quickly rebukes and recollects himself, saying, "Why art thou cast
   down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God,"
   Ps. xliii. 2, 5.

   We must say, then, unto such heartless complainers, as God did to
   Joshua, "Get you up; why lie you thus upon your faces?" Do you think to
   mend your condition by wishing it better, or complaining it is so bad?
   Are your complaints of want of an interest in forgiveness a sanctified
   means to obtain it? Not at all; you will not deal so with yourselves in
   things natural or civil. In such things you will take an industrious
   course for a remedy or for relief. In things of the smallest importance
   in this world and unto this life, you will not content yourselves with
   wishing and complaining; as though industry in the use of natural
   means, for the attaining of natural ends, were the ordinance of God,
   and diligence in the use of spiritual means, for the obtaining of
   spiritual ends, were not.

   Do not consult your own hearts only. What is it that the Scripture
   calls for in your condition? Is it not industry and activity of spirit?
   And what doth the nature of the thing require? Distress that is yet
   hoped to be conquered evidently calls for industry and diligence in the
   use of means for deliverance. If you are past hope, it avails not to
   complain; if you are not, why do you give up yourselves to
   despondencies? Our Saviour tells us that "the kingdom of heaven
   suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force," Matt. xi. 12. It
   is not of the outward violence of its enemies seeking to destroy it
   that our Saviour speaks, but of that spiritual fervency and ardency of
   mind that is in those who intend to be partakers of it; for biazetai,
   "is taken by force," Luke xvi. 16, is no more but. euangelizetai, "is
   preached;" -- "The kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth
   into it." Pressing into it, and taking it by force, are the same thing.
   There is, then, a violence, a restless activity and vigour of spirit,
   to be used and exercised for an interest in this kingdom. Apply this to
   your condition. Are you in depths and doubts, staggering and uncertain,
   not knowing what is your condition, nor whether you have any interest
   in the forgiveness that is with God Are you tossed up and down between
   hopes and fears? [Do you] want peace, consolation, and establishment?
   Why lie you upon your faces? Get up, watch, pray, fast, meditate, offer
   violence to your lusts and corruptions; fear not, startle not at their
   crying or importunities to be spared; press unto the throne of grace by
   prayers, supplications, importunities, restless requests. This is the
   way to take the kingdom of heaven. These things are not peace, they are
   not assurance; but they are part of the means that God hath appointed
   for the attainment of them.

   What, then, is the peculiar instruction that is proper for souls in
   this condition? That, plainly, of the apostle, 2 Pet. i. 10, "Give
   diligence to make your calling and election sure." "Alas!" saith the
   soul, "I am at no certainty, but rather am afflicted and tossed, and
   not comforted. My heart will come to no stability. I have no assurance,
   know not whether I am chosen or called; yea, fear that my latter end
   will be darkness and sorrow. There is, I confess, forgiveness with God,
   but [I] justly fear I shall never be made partaker of it." What is the
   usual course that is taken in such complaints by them to whom they are
   made? Mostly, they have a good opinion of them that come with these
   complaints; they judge them to be godly and holy, though much in the
   dark. If they knew them not before, yet upon these complaints they
   begin to be well persuaded of them. Hereupon, they are moved with pity
   and compassion, and troubled to see them in their perplexities, and set
   themselves to tender relief unto them: they mind them of the gracious
   promises of the gospel; it may be, fix upon some one or more of them in
   particular, which they explain to them; thence they mind them of the
   abundant grace and tender love of the Father, of the merciful care of
   our High Priest, his readiness and ability to save, his communications
   of such favours unto them as they perceive not. By such ways and means,
   by such applications, do they seek to relieve them in the state and
   condition wherein they are. But what is the issue? Doth not this relief
   prove, for the most part, like the morning cloud, and as the early dew?
   A little refreshment it may be it yields for a season, but is quickly
   again dried up, and the soul left in its heartless, withering
   condition.

   You will say, then, "Do you condemn this manner of proceeding with the
   souls of men in their doubts, fears, and distresses? or would you have
   them pine away under the sense of their condition, or abide in this
   uncertainty all their days?" I answer, No; I condemn not the way; I
   would not have any left comfortless in their depths. But yet I would
   give these two cautions --

   1. That spiritual wisdom and prudence is greatly required in this
   matter, in the administration of consolation to distressed souls. If in
   any thing, the tongue of the spiritually learned is required herein, --
   namely, in speaking a word in season to them that are weary. A
   promiscuous drawing out of gospel consolations, without a previous
   right judgment concerning the true state and condition of the souls
   applied unto, is seldom useful, ofttimes pernicious. And let men take
   care how they commit their souls and consciences unto such who have
   good words in readiness for all comers.

   2. If counsel and consolation of this kind be given, special and
   distinct from the advice we are upon of watchfulness, diligence,
   spiritual violence in a way of duty, it is exceeding dangerous, and
   will assuredly prove useless; for let us see what counsel the Holy
   Ghost gives in this condition unto them who would make their "calling
   and election sure," who would be freed from their present fears and
   uncertainties, who complain of their darkness and dangers. Why, saith
   he, "Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue," and so on, 2 Pet.
   i. 5-7;'?" for," saith he, "if ye do these things ye shall never fall:
   for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the
   everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ," verse 11.
   You who are now in the skirts of it, who know not whether you belong to
   it or no, you shall have an entrance into the kingdom of Christ, and
   all the joy, comforts, consolations, and glory of it shall be richly
   administered unto you. This is the advice that the Holy Ghost gives in
   this case; and this is the blessed promise annexed unto the following
   of this advice; and this the former compassionate course of
   administering consolation is not to be separated from.

   But you will, it may be, here say, "We are so dead and dull, so chained
   under the power of corruptions and temptations, that we are not able
   thus to put forth the fruit of a spiritual life in adding one grace
   unto another." But do you use diligence, study, endeavours, all
   diligence, diligence at all times, in all ways by God appointed, all
   manner of diligence within and without, in private and public, to this
   end and purpose? Do you study, meditate, pray, watch, fast, neglect no
   opportunity, keep your hearts, search, try, examine yourselves, flee
   temptations and occasions of cooling, deadening, and stifling grace? Do
   these things abound in you? Alas! you cannot do thus, you are so weak,
   so indisposed. But, alas! you will not, you will not part with your
   ease, you will not crucify your lusts, you will not use all diligence;
   but must come to it, or be contented to spend all your days in
   darkness, and to lie down in sorrow.

   Thus do men frequently miscarry. Is it any news, for persons to bewail
   the folly of their nature and ways in the morning and evening, and yet
   scarce stand upon their watch any part of the day, or in any occasion
   of the day? Is this "giving all diligence?" Is this "working out our
   salvation with fear and trembling?" And may we not see professors even
   indulging themselves in ways of vanity, folly, wrath, envy, sloth, and
   the like, and yet complain at what a loss they are, how unquiet, how
   uncertain? God forbid it should be otherwise with you, or that we
   should endeavour to speak peace unto you in any such a frame. To hear
   of a person that he walks slothfully, carelessly, or indulgeth his
   corruptions, and to find him complaining that he is at a loss whether
   he have any interest in pardon or no; to give or tender comfort to such
   mourners, without a due admonition of their duty to use diligence in
   the use of means, for to help on their delivery out of the condition
   wherein they are, is to tender poison unto them.

   To this, then, the soul must come that is in depths, if it intend to be
   delivered. Heartless complaints, with excuses to keep it from vigorous,
   spiritual diligence, must be laid aside; if not, ordinarily, peace,
   rest, and stability will not be obtained. A great example hereof we
   have in the spouse, Cant. v. 2-8. She is drowsy and indisposed unto
   communion with Christ, whereunto she is invited, verse 2; this puts her
   upon making excuses, from the unfitness of the time, and her present
   indisposition and unpreparedness as to the duty whereunto she was
   called, verse 3. Hereupon Christ withdraws his presence from her, and
   leaves her at a loss as to her former comforts, verse 6. What course
   doth she now take? Doth she now lie down again in her former slumber?
   doth she make use of her former excuses and pretences why she should
   not engage into the duties she was called unto? No such thing; but now,
   with all earnestness, diligence, sedulity, and importunity, she
   engageth in all manner of duties, whereby she may recover her former
   comforts, as you may see in the text. And this must be the course of
   others who would obtain the same success. Spiritual peace and sloth
   will never dwell together in the same soul and conscience.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule IX.

   The ninth rule -- Take heed of undue expressions concerning God and his
   ways in distress.

   Take heed, in doubts, distresses, and perplexities, of hard thoughts of
   God, hasty unweighed expressions concerning him or his ways, or of
   secret resolves that it were as good give over waiting as continue in
   the state wherein you are, seeing your condition is remediless.

   On three occasions are such thoughts and resolves apt to befall the'
   minds of men; which sometimes break forth into unwarrantable
   expressions concerning God himself and his ways --

   1. In deep perplexities of mind, by reason of some pressing terror from
   the Lord.

   2. On the long wearisome continuance of some tempting distress; and
   hereof we have many examples, some whereof shall be mentioned.

   3. In spiritual disappointments, through the strength of lust or
   temptation. When a person hath, it may be, recovered himself, through
   grace, from a perplexing sense of the guilt of some sin, or it may be
   from a course, shorter or longer, lesser or greater, of backsliding and
   negligent walking with God, and therein goes on cheerfully for a season
   in the course of his obedience; if this person, through the power of
   temptation, subtilty of lusts, neglect of watchfulness, by one means or
   other, is surprised in the sins or ways that he had relinquished, or is
   turned aside from the vigour of that course wherein he was engaged, he
   may be exposed not only to great despondencies, but also be overtaken
   with secret resolves to give over contending, seeing it is to no more
   purpose, nay, to no purpose, and that God regards him not at all.

   Take an instance or two in each kind:--

   The first we have in Job, in the extremity of his trials and terrors
   from the Lord. See, among other places, chap. x. 3: "Is it," saith he
   to God, "good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
   shouldest despise the work of thine hands?" All! poor worms, with whom
   have we to do? "Who shall say unto a king, Thou art wicked? and to
   princes, Ye are ungodly? And will ye speak to Him who respecteth not
   the person of princes, nor regardeth them more than the poorest in the
   earth?" And see what conclusions from such thoughts as these he doth
   infer: chap. xiv. 16, 17, "Thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch
   over my sin? My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up
   mine iniquity." He chargeth God to be his enemy, one that watched for
   all opportunities and advantages against him, that seemed to be glad at
   his halting, and take care that none of his sins should be missing when
   he intended to deal with him. Had this indeed been the case with him,
   he had perished unto eternity, as elsewhere he acknowledged.

   Of the other we have an instance in the church: Lam. iii. 18, "I said,
   My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord." Present grace in
   spiritual strength and future expectation of mercy are all gone. And
   what is got by this? Secret hard thoughts of God himself are hereby
   ingenerated: as verse 8, "When I cry and shout, he shutteth out my
   prayer;" verse 44, "Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our
   prayer should not pass through." These things are grievous unto God to
   bear, and no way useful to the soul in its condition; yea, they more
   and more unfit it for every duty that may lie in a tendency to its
   relief and deliverance.

   So was it with Jonah: chap. ii. 4, "I said, I am east out of thy
   sight;" -- "All is lost and gone with me; as good give over as contend;
   I do but labour in vain. Perish I must, as one cast out of the sight of
   God." The like complaints fell also from Heman in his distress, Ps.
   lxxxviii.

   The general who heard one of his soldiers cry out, upon a fresh onset
   of the enemy, "Now we are undone, now we are ruined," called him a
   traitor, and told him it was not so whilst he could wield his sword. It
   is not for every private soldier on every danger to make judgment of
   the battle; that is the work of the general. Jesus Christ is "the
   captain of our salvation;" he hath undertaken the leading and conduct
   of our souls through all our difficulties. Our duty is to fight and
   contend; his work is to take care of the event, and to him it is to be
   committed.

   That, then, you make a due use of this rule, keep always in your minds
   these two considerations --

   1. That it is not for you to take the judgment of Christ out of his
   hand, and to be passing sentence upon your own souls. Judgment as to
   the state and condition of men is committed unto Christ, and to him it
   is to be left. This we were directed unto in our first rule, and it is
   of special use in the case under consideration. Self-judging in
   reference unto sin and the demerit of it is our duty. The judging of
   our state and condition in relation unto the remedy provided is the
   office and work of Jesus Christ, with whom it is to be left.

   2. Consider that hard thoughts of what God will do with you, and harsh
   desponding sentences pronounced against yourselves, will insensibly
   alienate your hearts from God. It may be when men's perplexities are at
   the height, and the most sad expressions are as it were wrested from
   them, they yet think they must justify God, and that they do so
   accordingly. But yet such thoughts as those mentioned are very apt to
   infect the mind with other inclinations: for after a while they will
   prevail with the soul to look on God as an enemy, as one that hath no
   delight in it; and what will be the consequence thereof is easily
   discernible. None will continue to love long where they expect no
   returns. Suffer not, then, your minds to be tainted with such thoughts;
   and let not God be dishonoured by any such expressions as reflect on
   that infinite grace and compassion which he is exercising towards you.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule X.

   The tenth rule -- Duly improve the least appearances of God in a way of
   grace or pardon.

   If you would come to stability, and a comforting persuasion of an
   interest in forgiveness by the blood of Christ, improve the least
   appearances of him unto your souls, and the least intimations of his
   love in pardon, that are made unto you in the way of God. The spouse
   takes notice of her Husband, and rejoiceth in him, when he stands
   behind the wall, when he doth but look forth at the window and show
   himself at the lattice, -- when she could have no clear sight of him,
   Cant. ii. 9. She lays hold on the least appearance of him to support
   her heart withal, and to stir up her affections towards him. Men in
   dangers do not sit still to watt until something presents itself unto
   them that will give assured deliverance; but they close with that which
   first presents itself unto them, that is of the same kind and nature
   with what they look after. And thus God doth in many places express
   such supportments as give the soul little more than a possibility of
   attaining the end aimed at: as Zeph. ii 3, "It may be ye shall be hid
   in the day of the Lord's anger;" and Joel ii. 14, "Who knoweth but he
   will return and leave a blessing?" -- "It maybe we shall be hid; it may
   be we shall have a blessing." And this was the best ground that
   Jonathan had for the great undertaking against the enemies of God: 1
   Sam. xiv. 6, "It may be that the Lord will work for us." And to what
   end doth God at any time make these seemingly dubious intimations of
   grace and mercy? Is it that we should, by the difficulty included in
   them, be discouraged and kept from him? Not at all; he speaks nothing
   to deter sinners, especially distressed sinners, from trusting in him.
   But his end is, that we should close with, and lay hold upon and
   improve, the least appearances of grace, which this kind of expressions
   doth give unto us. When men are in a voyage at sea, and meet with a
   storm or a tempest which abides upon them, and they fear will at last
   prevail against them, if they make so far a discovery of land as that
   they can say, "It may be there is land, it may be it is such a place
   where there is a safe harbour," none can positively say it is not;
   there lies no demonstration against it. In this condition, especially
   if there be no other way of escape, delivery, or safety proposed to
   them, this is enough to make them to follow on that discovery, and with
   all diligence to steer their course that way, until they have made a
   trial of it unto the utmost. The soul of which we speak is afflicted
   and tossed, and not comforted. There is in the intimation of grace and
   pardon intended a remote discovery made of some relief. This may be
   Christ; it may be forgiveness. This it is convinced of; it cannot deny
   but at such or such a time, under such ordinances, or in such duties,
   it was persuaded that yet there might be mercy and pardon for it. This
   is enough to carry it to steer its course constantly that way, -- to
   press forward unto that harbour which will give it rest. How little was
   it that David had to bring his soul unto a composure in his great
   distress! 2 Sam. xv. 25, 26: "If," saith he, "I shall find favour in
   the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and shew me the ark, and
   his habitation: but if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold,
   here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him." He hath nothing
   but sovereign grace to rest upon, and that he gives himself up unto.

   Faith is indeed the soul's venture for eternity. Something it is to
   venture on as to its eternal condition. It must either adhere unto
   itself or its own vain hopes of a righteousness of its own; or it must
   give over all expectation and lie down in darkness; or it must shut out
   all dreadful apprehensions of eternity, by the power and activity of
   its lusts and carnal affections; or it must, whatever its
   discouragements be, cast itself upon pardon in the blood of Jesus
   Christ. Now, if all the former ways be detestable and pernicious, if
   the best of them be a direct opposition unto the gospel, what hath the
   soul that inquires after these things to do but to adhere unto the
   last, and to improve every encouragement, even the least, to that
   purpose?
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule XI.

   [Consider where lies the hinderance to peace.]

   As a close unto these general rules, I shall only add this last
   direction:-- Consider in particular where the stress and hinderance
   lies that keeps you off from peace, through an established persuasion
   of an interest in evangelical pardon. Do not always fluctuate up and
   down in generals and uncertainties; but drive things unto a particular
   issue, that it may be tried whether it be of sufficient efficacy to
   keep you in your present entanglements and despondencies. Search out
   your wound, that it may be tried whether it be curable or no.

   Now, in this case, we cannot expect that persons should suggest their
   own particular concerns, that so they might be considered and be
   brought unto the rule; But we must ourselves reduce such distresses as
   may or do in this matter Befall the minds of men unto some general
   heads, and give a judgment concerning them according to the word of
   truth. Indeed, particular cases, as varied by circumstances, are
   endless, nor can they be spoken unto in this way of instruction and
   direction; but they must be left to occasional considerations of them,
   as they are represented unto them who are intrusted to dispense the
   mysteries of God. Besides, many have laboured already in this matter,
   and their endeavours are in and of general use; although it must be
   said, as was before observed, that special cases are so varied By their
   circumstances, that it is very rare that any resolutions of them are
   every way adequate and suited unto the apprehensions of them that are
   exercised with them. I shall therefore call things unto some general
   heads, whereunto most of the objections that distressed sinners make
   against their own peace may be reduced, and leave the light of them to
   be applied in particular unto the relief of the souls of men, as God
   shall be pleased to make them effectual.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Second general head of the application of the truth insisted on --
   Grounds of spiritual disquietments considered -- The first, afflictions
   -- Ways and means of the aggravation of afflictions -- Rules about
   them.

   That which now lieth before us is the second part of the second general
   use educed from the truth insisted on. Our aim is, to lead on souls
   towards peace with God, through a gracious persuasion of their interest
   in that forgiveness which is with him; and it consists, as was
   declared, in a consideration of some of those disquietments which
   befall the minds of men, and keep them off from establishment in this
   matter.

   And, first, such disquietments and objections against the peace of the
   soul and its acceptance with God will arise from afflictions; they have
   done so of old, they do so in many at this day. Afflictions, I say,
   greatened unto the mind from their nature or by their concomitants, do
   ofttimes variously affect it, and sometimes prevail to darken it so far
   as to ingenerate thoughts that they are all messengers of wrath, all
   tokens of displeasure, and so, consequently, evidences that we are not
   pardoned or accepted with God.

   Now, this is a time of great afflictions unto many, and those, some of
   them, such as have innumerable aggravating circumstances accompanying
   of them. Some have come with a dreadful surprisal in things not looked
   for, such as falls not out in the providence of God in many
   generations. Such is the condition of them who are reduced to the
   utmost extremity by the late consuming fire; some have had their whole
   families, all their posterity, taken from them. In a few days they have
   been suddenly bereaved, as in the plague. Some in their own persons, or
   in their relations, have had sore, long, and grievous trials from
   oppressions and persecutions. And these things have various effects on
   the minds of men. Some we find crying, with that wicked king, "This
   evil is of the Lord; why should we wait any longer for him?" and give
   up themselves to seek relief from their own lusts; -- some bear up
   under their troubles with a natural stoutness of spirit; -- some have
   received a sanctified use and improvement of their trials with joy in
   the Lord: but many we find to go heavily under their burdens, having
   their minds darkened with many misapprehensions of the love of God and
   of their own personal interest in his grace. It is not, therefore,
   unseasonable to speak a little to this head of trouble in our entrance.
   Outward troubles, I say, are oftentimes occasions, if not the causes,
   of great inward distresses. You know how the saints of old expressed
   their sense of them and conflicts with them. The complaints of David
   are familiar to all who attend unto any communion with God in these
   things; so are those of Job, Heman, Jonah, Jeremiah, and others:
   neither do they complain only of their troubles, but of the sense which
   they had of God's displeasure in and under them, and of his hiding of
   his face from them whilst they were so exercised.

   It is not otherwise at present, as is known unto such as converse with
   many who are either surprised with unexpected troubles, or worn out
   with trials and disappointments of an expected end. They consider
   themselves both absolutely and with respect unto others, and upon both
   accounts are filled with dark thoughts and despondencies. Saith one, "I
   am rolled from one trial unto another. The clouds with me return still
   after the rain. All the billows and water-spouts of God go over me. In
   my person, it may be, pressed with sickness, pains, troubles; in my
   relations, with their sins, miscarriages, or death; in my outward
   state, in want, losses, disreputation. I am even as a withered branch.
   Surely if God had any especial regard unto my soul, it would not be
   thus with me, or some timely end would have been put unto these
   dispensations." On the other hand, they take a view of some other
   professors; they see that their sables are spread day by day, that the
   candle of the Lord shines continually on their tabernacle, and that in
   all things they have their hearts' desire, setting aside the common
   attendancies of human nature, and nothing befalls them grievous in the
   world. "Thus it is with them. And surely, had I an interest in his
   grace, in pardon, the God of Israel would not thus pursue a flea in the
   mountains, nor set himself in battle army against a leaf driven to and
   fro with the wind; he would spare me a little, and let me alone for a
   moment. But as things are with me, I fear my way is hidden from the
   Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God.'?" This kind of
   thoughts do perplex the minds of men, and keep them off from partaking
   of that strong consolation which God is abundantly willing they should
   receive, by a comfortable persuasion of a blessed interest in that
   forgiveness that is with him.

   And this was the very case of David; or at least these outward troubles
   were a special part of those depths out of which he cried for relief,
   by a sense of pardon, grace, and redemption with God.

   I answer to these complaints, first, that there are so many excellent
   things spoken concerning afflictions, their necessity, their
   usefulness, and the like, -- such blessed ends are assigned unto them,
   and in many have been compassed and fulfilled by them, -- that a man,
   unacquainted with the exercise wherewith they are attended, would think
   it impossible that any one should be shaken in mind as to the love and
   favour of God on their account. But as the apostle tells us that no
   afflictions are joyous at present, but grievous, so he who made, in the
   close of his trials, that solemn profession, that "it was good for him
   that he had been afflicted," yet we know, as hath been declared, how he
   was distressed under them. There are, therefore, sundry accidental
   things which accompany great afflictions, that seem to exempt them from
   the common rule and the promise of love and grace; as, --

   1. The remembrance of past and buried miscarriages and sins lies in the
   bosom of many afflictions. It was so with Job: "Thou makest me," saith
   he, "to possess the iniquities of my youth." See his plea to that
   purpose, chap. xiii. 23-27. In the midst of his troubles and
   distresses, God revived upon his spirit a sense of former sins, even
   the sins of his youth, and made him to possess them; he filled his soul
   and mind with thoughts of them and anxiety about them. This made him
   fear lest God was his enemy, and would continue to deal with him in all
   severity. So was it with Joseph's brethren in their distresses: Gen.
   xlii. 21, "They said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
   our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought
   us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us;"
   and verse 22, "Behold, his blood is required." Their distress revives a
   deep, perplexing sense of the guilt of sin many years past before, and
   that under all its aggravating circumstances; which spoiled them of all
   their reliefs and comforts, filling them with confusion and trouble,
   though absolutely innocent as to what was come on them. And the like
   appeared in the widow of Zarephath, with whom Elijah sojourned during
   the famine. Upon the death of her son, which, it seems, was somewhat
   extraordinary, she cried out unto the prophet, "What have I to do with
   thee, O thou man of God? art thou come to call my sin to remembrance,
   and to slay my son?" 1 Kings xvii. 18. It seems some great sin she had
   formerly contracted the guilt of, and now, upon her sore affliction in
   the death of her only child, the remembrance of it was recalled and
   revived upon her soul. Thus "deep calleth unto deep at the noise of
   God's water-spouts," and then "all his waves and billows go over" a
   person, Ps. xlii. 7. The deep of afflictions calleth up the deep of the
   guilt of sin, and both in conjunction become as billows and waves
   passing over the soul. We see only the outside of men's afflictions;
   they usually complain only of what doth appear: and an easy thing it is
   supposed to be to apply relief and comfort unto those that are
   distressed. The rule in this matter is so clear, so often repeated and
   inculcated, the promises annexed unto this condition so many and
   precious, that every one hath in readiness what to apply unto them who
   are so exercised. But oftentimes we know nothing of the gall and
   wormwood that is in men's affliction; they keep that to themselves, and
   their souls feed upon them in secret, Lam. iii. 19. God hath stirred up
   the remembrance of some great sin or sins, and they look upon their
   afflictions as that wherein he is come or beginning to enter into
   judgment with them. And is it any wonder if they be in darkness, and
   filled with disconsolation?

   2. There is in many afflictions something that seems new and peculiar,
   wherewith the soul is surprised, and cannot readily reduce its
   condition unto what is taught about afflictions in general. This
   perplexeth and entangleth it. It is not affliction it is troubled
   withal, but some one thing or other in it that appears with an especial
   dread unto the soul, so that he questioneth whether ever it were so
   with any other or no, and is thereby deprived of the supportment which
   from former examples it might receive. And, indeed, when God intendeth
   that which shall be a deep affliction, he will put an edge upon it, in
   matter, or manner, or circumstances, that shall make the soul feel its
   sharpness. He will not take up with our bounds and measures, and with
   which we think we could be contented; but he will put the impress of
   his own greatness and terror upon it, that he may be acknowledged and
   submitted unto. Such was the state with Naomi, when, from a full and
   plentiful condition, she went into a strange country with a husband and
   two sons, where they all died, leaving her destitute and poor. Hence,
   in her account of God's dealing with her, she says, "Call me not Naomi"
   (that is, pleasant), "call me Mara" (that is, bitter): "for the
   Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. I went out full, and the
   Lord hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi,
   seeing the Lord hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath
   afflicted me?" Ruth i. 20, 21. So was it with Job, with the widow of
   Zarephath, and with her at Nain who was burying her only child. And
   still in many afflictions God is pleased to put in an entangling
   specialty, which perplexeth the soul, and darkens it in all its
   reasonings about the love of God towards it and its interest in pardon
   and grace.

   3. In some, affections are very strong and importunate as fixed on
   lawful things, whereby their nature is made sensible and tender, and
   apt to receive very deep impressions from urgent afflictions. Now,
   although this in itself be a good natural frame, and helps to preserve
   the soul from that stout-heartedness which God abhors, yet if it be not
   watched over, it is apt to perplex the soul with many entangling
   temptations. The apostle intimates a double evil that we are obnoxious
   unto under trials and afflictions, Heb. xii. 5, "My son, despise not
   thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of
   him." Men may either, through a natural stoutness, despise and contemn
   their sufferings, and be obstinate under them, or faint and despond;
   and so come short of the end which God aims at for them, to be attained
   in a way of duty. Now, though the frame spoken of be not obnoxious unto
   the first extreme, yet it is greatly to the latter; which, if not
   watched against, is no less pernicious than the former. Affections in
   such persons being greatly moved, they cloud and darken the mind, and
   fill it with strange apprehensions concerning God and themselves. Every
   thing is presented unto them through a glass composed of fear, dread,
   terror, sorrow, and all sorts of disconsolations. This makes them faint
   and despond, unto very sad apprehensions of themselves and their
   conditions.

   4. Afflictions find some entangled with very strong corruptions, -- as
   love of the world, or the pleasure of it, of name or reputation, of
   great contrivances for posterity, and the like; or it may be in things
   carnal or sensual. Now, when these unexpectedly meet together, -- great
   afflictions and strong corruptions, -- it is not conceivable what a
   combustion they will make in the soul As a strong medicine or potion
   meeting with a strong or tough distemper in the body, -- there is a
   violent contention in nature between them and about them, so that
   oftentimes the very life of the patient is endangered; so it is where a
   great trial, a smart stroke of the hand of God, falls upon a person in
   the midst of his pursuit of the effects of some corruptions, -- the
   soul is amazed even to distraction, and can scarce have any thought but
   that God is come to cut the person off in the midst of his sin. Every
   unmortified corruption fills the very fear and expectation of
   affliction with horror. And there is good reason that so it should do;
   for although God should be merciful unto men's iniquities, yet if he
   should come to take vengeance of their inventions, their condition
   would be dark and sorrowful

   5. Satan is never wanting in such occasions to attempt the compassing
   of his ends upon persons that are exercised under the hand of God. In
   the time of suffering it was that he fell upon the Head of the church,
   turning it into the very hour of the power of darkness. And he will not
   omit any appearing opportunities of advantage against his members. And
   this is that which he principally, in such seasons, attacks them
   withal, -- namely, that God regards them not, that they are fallen
   under his judgment and severity, as those who have no share in mercy,
   pardon, or forgiveness.

   From these and the like reasons, I say, it is, that whereas afflictions
   in general are so testified unto, to be such pledges and tokens of
   God's love and care, to be designed unto blessed ends as conformity
   unto Christ, and a participation of the holiness of God; yet, by reason
   of these circumstances, they often prove means of casting the soul into
   depths, and of hindering it from a refreshing interest in the
   forgiveness that is with God. That this may prove no real or abiding
   ground of inward spiritual trouble unto the soul, the following rules
   and directions may be observed:--

   1. Not only afflictions in general, but great and manifold afflictions,
   and those attended with all sorts of aggravating circumstances, are
   always consistent with the pardon of sin, after [often?] signal tokens
   and pledges of it, and of the love of God therein: Job vii. 17, 18,
   "What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest
   set thine heart upon him? and that thou shouldest visit him every
   morning, and try him every moment?" What were the considerations that
   cast him into this admiration of the care and love of God is expressed,
   verses 12-16. There are no words of a more dismal import in the whole
   book than those here expressed: yet, when he recollected himself from
   his overwhelming distress, he acknowledgeth that all this proceeded
   from the love and care of God; yea, his fixing his heart upon a man to
   magnify him, to set him up and do him good. For this end doth he
   chasten a man every morning, and try him every moment; and that with
   such afflictions as are for the present so far from being joyous as
   that they give no rest, but even weary the soul of life, as he
   expresseth their effects on himself, verses 15, 16. And hence it is
   observed of this Job, that when none in the earth was like to him in
   trouble, God gave him three testimonies from heaven that there was none
   in the earth like unto him in grace. And although it may not be laid
   down as a general rule, yet for the most part in the providence of God,
   from the foundation of the world, those who have had most of
   afflictions have had most of grace and the most eminent testimonies of
   acceptance with God. Christ Jesus, the Son of God, the head of the
   church, had all afflictions gathered into a head in him, and yet the
   Father always loved him, and was always well pleased with him.

   When God solemnly renewed his covenant with Abraham, and he had
   prepared the sacrifice whereby it was to be ratified and confirmed, God
   made a smoking furnace to pass between the pieces of the sacrifice,
   Gen. xv. 17. It was to let him know that there was a furnace of
   affliction attending the covenant of grace and peace. And so he tells
   Zion that he "chose her in the furnace of affliction," Isa. xlviii. 10;
   -- that is, in Egyptian affliction; burning, flaming afflictions;
   "fiery trials," as Peter calls them, 1 Pet. iv. 12. There can, then, no
   argument be drawn from affliction, from any kind of it, from any
   aggravating circumstance wherewith it may be attended, that should any
   way discourage the soul in the comforting, supporting persuasion of an
   interest in the love of God and forgiveness thereby.

   2. No length or continuance of afflictions ought to be any impeachment
   of our spiritual consolation. Take for the confirmation hereof the
   great example of the Son of God. How long did his afflictions continue?
   what end or issue was put to them? No longer did they abide than until
   "he cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost." To the moment of
   his death, from his manger to his cross, his afflictions still
   increased, and he ended his days in the midst of them. Now, he was the
   head of the church, and the great representative of it, unto a
   conformity with whom we are predestinated. And if God will have it so
   with us even in this particular, so as that we shall have no rest, no
   peace from our trials, until we lie down in the grave, that whatever
   condition we pass through they shall be shut out of none, but only from
   immortality and glory, what have we herein to complain of?

   3. Where the remembrance and perplexing sense of past sins is revived
   by present afflictions, separate them in your minds and deal distinctly
   about them. So long as you carry on the consideration of them jointly,
   you will be rolled from one to another, and never obtain rest unto your
   souls. They will mutually aggravate each other. The sharpness of
   affliction will add to the bitterness of the sense of sin; and the
   sense of sin will give an edge to affliction, and cause it to pierce
   deeply into the soul, as we showed in the former instances. Deal,
   therefore, distinctly about them, and in their proper order. So doth
   the psalmist here. He had at present both upon him; and together they
   brought him into these depths, concerning which he so cries out for
   deliverance from them: see Ps. xxxii. 3-5. And what course doth he
   take? He applies himself in the first place to his sin and the guilt of
   it, and that distinctly and separately. And when he hath got a
   discharge of sin, which he waited so earnestly for, his faith quickly
   arose above his outward trials, as appears in his blessed close of
   all:" He shall redeem Israel out of all his trouble;' the whole Israel
   of God, and myself amongst them." This do, then -- Single out the sin
   or sins that are revived in the sense of their guilt upon the
   conscience; use all diligence to come to an issue about them in the
   blood of Christ This God by your affliction calls you unto. This is the
   disease, whereof your trouble is but the symptom. This, therefore, in
   the cure you seek after, is first and principally to be attended unto;
   when that is once removed, the other, as to any prejudice unto your
   soul, will depart of itself. The root being once digged up, you shall
   not long feed on the bitter fruit that it hath brought forth; or if you
   do, the wormwood shall be taken out of it, and it shall be very
   pleasant unto you, as well as wholesome. How this is to be done, by an
   application unto God for forgiveness, hath been at large declared. But
   if men will deal with confused thoughts about their sins and their
   troubles, their wound will be incurable and their sorrow endless.

   4. Remember that a time of affliction is a time of temptation. Satan,
   as we have showed, will not be wanting unto any appearing opportunity
   or advantage of setting upon the soul. When Pharaoh heard that the
   people were entangled in the wilderness, he pursued them; and when
   Satan sees a soul entangled with its distresses and troubles, he thinks
   it his time and hour to assault it. He seeks to winnow, and comes when
   the corn is under the flail. Reckon, therefore, that when trouble
   cometh, the prince of the world cometh also, that you may be provided
   for him. Now is the time to take the shield of faith, that we may be
   able to quench his fiery darts. If they be neglected, they will inflame
   the soul. Watch, therefore, and pray, that you enter not into
   temptation, that Satan do not represent God falsely unto you. He that
   durst represent Job falsely to the all-seeing God will with much
   boldness represent God falsely unto us, who see and know so little. Be
   not, then, ignorant of his devices, but every way set yourselves
   against his interposing between God and your souls in a matter which he
   hath nothing to do withal. Let not this make-bate by any means inflame
   the difference.

   5. Learn to distinguish the effect of natural distempers from spiritual
   distresses. Some have sad, dark, and tenacious thoughts fixed on their
   minds from their natural distempers. These will not be cured by
   reasonings, nor utterly quelled by faith. Our design must be, to abate
   their efficacy and consequents by considering their occasions. And if
   men cannot do this in themselves, it is highly incumbent on those who
   make application of relief unto them to be careful to discern what is
   from such principles, whereof they are not to expect a speedy cure.
   And, --

   6. Take heed in times of peace and ease that you lay not up, by your
   negligence or careless walking, sad provision for a day of darkness, a
   time of afflictions. It is sin that imbitters troubles; the sins of
   peace are revived in time of distress. Fear of future affliction, of
   impendent troubles, should make us careful not to bring that into them
   which will make them hitter and sorrowful.

   7. Labour to grow better under all your afflictions, lest your
   afflictions grow worse, lest God mingle them with more darkness,
   bitterness, and terror. As Joab said unto David, if he ceased not his
   scandalous lamentation on the death of Absalom, all the people would
   leave him, and he then should find himself in a far worse condition
   than that which he bemoaned, or any thing that befell him from his
   youth; -- the same may be said unto persons under their afflictions. If
   they are not managed and improved in a due manner, that which is worse
   may, nay, in all probability will, befall them. Wherever God takes this
   way, and engageth in afflicting, he doth commonly pursue his work until
   he hath prevailed, and his design towards the afflicted party be
   accomplished. He will not cease to thresh and break the bread-corn
   until it be meet for his use. Lay down, then, the weapons of thy
   warfare against him; give up yourselves to his will; let go every thing
   about which he contends with you; follow after that which he calls you
   unto; and you will find light arising unto you in the midst of
   darkness. Hath he a cup of affliction in one hand.? -- lift up your
   eyes, and you will see a cup of consolation in another. And if all
   stars withdraw their light whilst you are in the way of God, assure
   yourselves that the sun is ready to rise.

   8. According to the tenor of the covenant of grace, a man may be
   sensible of the respect of affliction unto sin, yea, unto this or that
   sin in particular, and yet have a comfortable persuasion of the
   forgiveness of sin. Thus it was in general in God's dealing with his
   people. He "forgave them," but he "took vengeance of their inventions,"
   Ps. xcix. 8. Whatever they suffered under the vengeance that fell upon
   their inventions (and that is as hard a word as is applied anywhere
   unto God's dealing with his people), yet, at the same time, he assured
   them of the pardon of their sin. So, you know, was the case of David.
   His greatest trial and affliction, and that which befell him on the
   account of a particular sin, and wherein God took vengeance on his
   invention, was ushered in with a word of grace, -- that God had done
   away or pardoned his sin, and that he should not die. This is expressed
   in the tenor of the covenant with the seed of Christ, Ps. lxxxix.
   31-34.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Objections against believing from things internal -- The person knows
   not whether he be regenerate or no -- State of regeneration asserted --
   Difference of saving and common grace -- This difference discernible --
   Men may know themselves to he regenerate -- The objection answered.

   Another head of objections and despondencies ariseth from things
   internal, -- things that are required in the soul, that it may have an
   interest in the forgiveness that is with God, some whereof we shall
   speak unto. And these respect, first, the state of the soul; and,
   secondly, some actings in the soul.

   First, As to the state. Say some, "Unless a man be regenerate and born
   again, he is not, he cannot be made partaker of mercy and pardon. Now,
   all things here are in the dark unto us; for, first, we know not well
   what this regeneration is, and it is variously disputed amongst men.
   Some would place it only in the outward signs of our initiation into
   Christ, and some otherwise express it. Again, it is uncertain whether
   those that are regenerate do or may know that they are so, or whether
   this may be in any measure known unto others with whom they may treat
   about it. And if it may not be known, we must be uncertain in this
   also. And then, it may be, for their parts, they neither know the time
   when, nor the manner how, any such work was wrought in them; and yet,
   without this, seeing it is wrought by means, and springs from certain
   causes, they can have no establishment in a not-failing persuasion of
   their acceptance with God by the pardon of their sins in the blood of
   Christ." This is the head and sum of most of the objections which
   perplexed souls do manage against themselves as to their state and
   condition. Hence, indeed, they draw forth reasonings with great
   variety, according as they are suggested by their particular occasions
   and temptations. And many proofs, taken from their sins, miscarriages,
   and fears, do they enforce their objections withal. My purpose is, to
   lay down some general rules and principles, which may be applied unto
   particular occasions and emergencies; and this shall be done in answer
   to the several parts of the general objection mentioned before. I say,
   then, --

   1. It is most certain that there are two estates and conditions that
   divide all mankind, and every one that lives in the world doth
   completely and absolutely belong unto one of them. These are, the state
   of nature and the state of grace, -- of sin and of righteousness by
   Christ. Every man in the world belongs unto one of these states or
   conditions. This the Scripture so abounds in that it seems to be the
   first principal thing that we are taught in it. It is as clear that
   there are two different states in this world as that there are so in
   that to come. Yea, all our faith and obedience depend on this truth;
   and not only so, but the covenant of God, the mediation of Christ, and
   all the promises and threats of the law and gospel, are built on this
   supposition. And this lays naked unto a spiritual eye that abounding
   atheism that is in the world. Men are not only, like Nicodemus,
   ignorant of these things, and wonder how they can be, but they scorn
   them, despise them, scoff at them. To make mention of being regenerate
   is exposed to reproach in the world. But whether men will or no, unto
   one of these conditions they must belong.

   2. As these two estates differ morally in themselves, and physically in
   the causes constitutive of that difference, so there is a specifical
   difference between the things that place men in the one condition and
   in the other. Whatever there is of goodness, virtue, duty, grace, in an
   unregenerate person, there is in him that is regenerate somewhat of
   another kind that is not in the other at all. For the difference of
   these states themselves, it is plain in Scripture; -- the one is a
   state of death, the other of life; the one of darkness, the other of
   light; the one of enmity against God, the other of reconciliation with
   him. And that the one state is constituted by that of grace, which is
   of a peculiar kind, and which is not in the other, I shall briefly
   declare --

   (1.) The grace of regeneration proceedeth from an especial spring and
   fountain, which emptieth much of its living waters into it, no one drop
   whereof falls on them that are not regenerate. This is electing love;
   it is given out in the pursuit of the decree of election: "God hath
   chosen us that we should be holy," Eph. i. 4. Our holiness, whose only
   spring is our regeneration, is an effect of our election, -- that which
   God works in our souls, in the pursuit of his eternal purpose of love
   and good-will towards us. So again saith the apostle, 2 Thess. ii. 13,
   "God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through
   sanctification of the Spirit." God having designed us unto salvation as
   the end, hath also appointed the sanctification of the Spirit to be the
   means to bring us orderly unto the attainment of that end. But the best
   of common grace or gifts that may be in men unregenerate are but
   products of the providence of God, ordering all things in general unto
   his own glory and the good of them that shall be heirs of salvation.
   They are not fruits of electing eternal love, nor designed means for
   the infallible attaining of eternal salvation.

   (2.) The graces of those that are regenerate have a manifold respect or
   relation to the Lord Christ, that the common graces of others have not.
   I shall name one or two of these respects:-- First, They have an
   especial moral relation to the mediatory acts of Christ in his oblation
   and intercession. Especial grace is an especial part of the purchase of
   Christ by his death and blood-shedding. He made a double purchase of
   his elect; -- of their persons, to be his; of especial grace, to be
   theirs: "He gave himself for the church, that he might sanctify and
   cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present
   it unto himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any
   such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish," Eph. v.
   25-27. The design of Christ in giving himself for his church was, to
   procure for it that especial grace whereby, through the use of means,
   it might be regenerate, sanctified, and purified: so Tit. ii. 14, "He
   gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
   purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works." Real
   purification in grace and holiness hath this especial relation unto the
   death of Christ, that he designed therein to procure it for them for
   whom he died; and in the pursuit of his purchase or acquisition of it,
   his purpose was really to bestow it upon them, or effectually to work
   it in them. Moreover, it hath an especial relation unto his
   intercession, and that in a distinguishing manner from any other gifts
   or common graces that other men may receive. Giving us the rule and
   pattern of his intercession, John xvii., he tells us that he so prays
   not for the world, but for his elect, those which the Father had given
   him; because they were his, verse 9. And what is it that he prays for
   them, in distinction from all other men whatever? Amongst others this
   is one principal thing that he insists on, verse 17, "Sanctify them
   through thy truth." Their sanctification and holiness is granted upon
   that prayer and intercession of Christ; which is peculiar unto them,
   with an exclusion of all others: "I pray for them; I pray not for the
   world." Now, the common grace of unregenerate persons, whereby they are
   distinguished from other men, whatever it be, it hath not this especial
   relation to the oblation and intercession of Christ. Common grace is
   not the procurement of especial intercession.

   Secondly, They have a real relation unto Christ, as he is the living,
   quickening head of the church; for he is so, even the living spiritual
   fountain of the spiritual life of it, and of all vital acts whatever:
   "Christ is our life; and our life is hid with him in God," Col. iii. 2,
   3. That eternal life which consists in the knowledge of the Father and
   the Son, John xvii. 3, is in him as the cause, head, spring, and
   fountain of it. In him it is in its fulness, and from thence it is
   derived unto all that believe, who receive from his fulness "grace for
   grace," John i. 16. All true, saving, sanctifying grace, all spiritual
   life, and every thing that belongs thereunto, is derived directly from
   Christ, as the living head of his church and fountain of all spiritual
   life unto them. This the apostle expresseth, Eph. iv. 15, 16, "Speaking
   the truth in love, grow up into him in all things, which is the head,
   even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined together and
   compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
   effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
   body unto the edifying of itself in love." To the same purpose he again
   expresseth the same matter, Col. ii. 19. All grace in the whole body
   comes from the head, Christ Jesus; and there is no growth or
   furtherance of it but by his effectual working in every part, to bring
   it unto the measure designed unto it. Nothing, then, no, not the least
   of this grace, can be obtained but by virtue of our union unto Christ
   as our head; because it consists in a vital, effectual influence from
   him and his fulness. And this kind of relation unto Christ, all grace
   that is or may be in unregenerate men is incapable of.

   (3.) The grace of regeneration and the fruits of it are administered in
   and by the covenant. This is the promise of the covenant, that God will
   write his law in our hearts, and put his fear in our inward parts, that
   we shall not depart from him, Jer. xxxi. This is that grace whereof we
   speak, whatever it be, or of what kind soever. It is bestowed on none
   but those who are taken into covenant with God; for unto them alone it
   is promised, and by virtue thereof is it wrought in and upon their
   souls. Now, all unregenerate men are strangers from the covenant, and
   are not made partakers of that grace which is peculiarly and only
   promised thereby and exhibited therein.

   (4.) The least spark of saving, regenerating grace is wrought in the
   soul by the Holy Ghost, as given unto men to dwell in them and to abide
   with them. He is the water given by Jesus Christ unto believers, which
   is in them "a well of water springing up into everlasting life," John
   iv. 14. First they receive the water, the spring itself, that is, the
   Holy Spirit, -- and from thence living waters do arise up in them; they
   are wrought, effected, produced by the Spirit, which is given unto
   them. Now, although the common gifts and graces of men unregenerate are
   effects of the power of the Holy Ghost wrought in them and bestowed on
   them, as are all other works of God's providence, yet it doth not work
   in them, as received by them, to dwell in them and abide with them, as
   a never-failing spring of spiritual life; for our Saviour says
   expressly that the world, or unbelievers, do not know the Spirit, nor
   can receive him, or have him abiding in them; -- all which, in a
   contradistinction unto all unregenerate persons, are affirmed of all
   them that do believe.

   (5.) The least of saving grace, such as is peculiar unto them that are
   regenerate, is spirit: John iii. 6, "That which is born of the Spirit
   is spirit." Whatever it is that is so born, it is spirit; it hath a
   spiritual being, and it is not educible by any means out of the
   principles of nature. So it is said to be a "new creature," 2 Cor. v.
   17. Be it never so little or so great, however it may differ in degrees
   in one and in another, yet the nature of it is the same in all, -- it
   is a "new creature." As the least worm of the earth, in the order of
   the old creation, is no less a creature than the sun, yea, or the most
   glorious angel in heaven; so, in the order of the new creation, the
   least spark or dram of true grace that is from the sanctifying Spirit
   is a new creature, no less than the highest faith or love that ever was
   in the chiefest of the apostles. Now, that which is spirit, and that
   which is not spirit, -- that which hath a new spiritual being, and that
   which hath none, -- whatever appearance of agreement there may be among
   them, do yet differ specifically from one another. And thus it is with
   the saving grace that is in a regenerate, and those common graces that
   are in others which are not so. So that as these are divers states, so
   they are eminently different and distinct the one from the other. And
   this answers the second thing laid down in the objections taken from
   the uncertainty of these states and of regeneration itself, and the
   real difference of it from the contrary state, which is exclusive of an
   interest in forgiveness.

   3. This is laid down in the inquiry, "Whether this state may be known
   unto him who is really partaker of it or translated into it, or unto
   others that may be concerned therein?" To which I say, The difference
   that is between these two states, and the constitutive causes of them,
   as it is real, so it is discernible. It may be known by themselves who
   are in those states, and others. It may be known who are born of God,
   and who are yet children of the devil, -- who are quickened by Christ,
   and who are yet "dead in trespasses and sins." But here also observe,
   --

   (1.) That I do not say this is always known to the persons themselves
   concerned in this distribution. Many cry, "Peace, peace," when sudden
   destruction is at hand. These either think themselves regenerate when
   they are not, or else wilfully despise the consideration of what is
   required in them that they may have peace, and so delude their own
   souls unto their ruin. And many that are truly born of God yet know it
   not; they may for a season walk in darkness, and have no light. Nor, --

   (2.) That this is always known to others. It is not known unto
   unregenerate men in respect of them that are so; for they know not
   really and substantially what it is to be so. Natural men perceive not
   the things of God; that is, spiritually, in their own light and nature,
   1 Cor. ii. And as they cannot aright discern the things which put men
   into that condition (for they are foolishness unto them), so they
   cannot judge aright of their persons in whom they are. And if they do
   at any time judge aright notionally concerning any things or persons,
   yet they do not judge so upon right grounds, nor with any evidence in
   or unto themselves of what they do judge. Wherefore generally they
   judge amiss of such persons; and because they make profession of
   somewhat which they find not in themselves, they judge them hypocrites,
   and false pretenders unto what is not: for those things which evince
   their union with Christ, and which evidence their being born of God,
   they savour them not, nor can receive them. Nor is this always known
   unto or discerned by them that are regenerate. They may sometimes, with
   Peter, think Simon Magus to be a true believer, or, with Eli, an Hannah
   to be a daughter of Belial. Many hypocrites are set forth with gifts,
   common graces, light, and profession, so that they pass amongst all
   believers for such as are born of God; and many poor saints may be so
   disguised, under darkness, temptation, sin, as to be looked on as
   strangers from that family whereunto indeed they do belong. The
   judgment of man may fail, but the judgment of God is according unto
   righteousness. Wherefore, --

   (3.) This is that we say, It may be known, in the sedulous use of means
   appointed for that end, to a man's self and others, which of the
   conditions mentioned he doth belong unto, -- that is, whether he be
   regenerate or no, -- so far as his or their concernment lies therein.
   This, I say, may be known, and that infallibly and assuredly, with
   reference unto any duty wherein from hence we are concerned. The
   discharge of some duties in ourselves and towards others depends on
   this knowledge; and therefore we may attain it so far as it is
   necessary for the discharge of such duties unto the glory of God. Now,
   because it is not directly in our way, yet having been mentioned, I
   shall briefly, in our passage, touch upon the latter, or what duties do
   depend upon our judging of others to be regenerate, and the way or
   principles whereby such a judgment may be made --

   [1.] There are many duties incumbent on us to be performed with and
   towards professors, which, without admitting a judgment to be made of
   their state and condition, cannot be performed in faith. And in
   reference unto these duties alone it is that we are called to judge the
   state of others; for we are not giving countenance unto a rash,
   uncharitable censuring of men's spiritual conditions, nor unto any
   judging of any men, any other than what our own duty towards them doth
   indispensably require. Thus, if we are to "lay down our lives for the
   brethren," it is very meet we should so far know them so to be as that
   we may hazard our lives in faith when we are called thereunto. We are
   also to join with them in those ordinances wherein we make a solemn
   profession that we are members of the same body with them, that we have
   the same Head, the same Spirit, faith, and love. We must love them
   because they are begotten of God, children of our heavenly Father; and
   therefore must on some good ground believe them so to be. In a word,
   the due performance of all principal mutual gospel duties, to the glory
   of God and our own edification, depends on this supposition, that we
   may have such a satisfying persuasion concerning the spiritual
   condition of others as that from thence we may take our aim in what we
   do.

   [2.] For the grounds hereof I shall mention one only, which all others
   do lean upon. This is pressed, 1 Cor. xii. 12, 13, "As the body is one,
   and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being
   many, are one body: so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we are all
   baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be
   bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit." They
   are all united unto and hold of one head; for as are the members of the
   body natural, under one head, so is Christ mystical, that is, all
   believers, under Christ their head. And this union they have by the
   inhabitation of the same quickening Spirit which is in Christ their
   head; and by him they are brought all into the same spiritual state and
   frame, -- they are made to drink into one and the same Spirit: for this
   same Spirit produceth the same effects in them all, -- the same in
   kind, though differing in degrees, -- as the apostle fully declares,
   Eph. iv. 3-6. And this Spirit is in them, and not in the world, John
   xvi. And as this gives them a naturalness in their duties one towards
   another, or in mutual caring for, rejoicing or sorrowing with, one
   another, as members one of another, 1 Cor. xii. 25, 26; so it reveals
   and discovers them to each other so far as is necessary for the
   performance of the duties mentioned, in such a manner as becomes
   members of the same body. There is on this account a spiritually
   natural answering of one to another, as face answereth face in the
   water. They can see and discern that in others whereof they have
   experience in themselves, -- they can taste and relish that in others
   which they feed upon in themselves, and wherein the lives of their
   souls do consist; the same Spirit of life being in them, they have the
   same spiritual taste and savour. And unless their palates are
   distempered by temptations, or false opinions, or prejudices, they can
   in their communion taste of that Spirit in each other which they are
   all made to drink into. This gives them the same likeness and image in
   the inward man, the same heavenly light in their minds, the same
   affections; and being thus prepared and enabled to judge and discern of
   the state of each other, in reference unto their mutual duties, they
   have, moreover, the true rule of the word to judge of all spirits and
   spiritual effects by. And this is the ground of all that love without
   dissimulation and real communion that is among the saints of God in
   this world. But here two cautions must be allowed:--

   (1st.) That we would not judge the state and condition of any men in
   the world, -- no farther than we are called thereunto in a way of duty;
   and we are so called only with reference unto the duties that we are to
   perform towards them. What have we to do to judge them that are
   without, -- that is, any one that we have not a call to consider in
   reference unto our own duty? Herein that great rule takes place, "Judge
   not, that ye be not judged." Let us leave all men, the worst of men,
   unless where evident duty requires other actings, to the judgment-seat
   of God. They are the servants of another, and they stand or fall unto
   their own master. There have been great miscarriages amongst us in this
   matter; some have been ready to condemn all that go not along with them
   in every principle, yea, opinion or practice. And every day slight
   occasions and provocations are made the grounds and reasons of severe
   censures; but nothing is more contrary to the conduct of the meek and
   holy spirit of Christ. This is our rule -- Are we called to act towards
   any as saints, as living members of the body of Christ, and that in
   such duties as we cannot perform in faith unless we are persuaded that
   so they are? -- then are we, on the grounds and by the ways before
   mentioned, to satisfy ourselves in one another.

   (2dly.) Do we endeavour mutually to discern the condition of one
   another in reference unto such ends? -- let us be sure to look unto and
   pursue those ends when we have attained our satisfaction. What these
   ends are hath been showed. It is, that we may love them without
   dissimulation, as members of the same mystical body with us; that we
   may naturally take care of them, and for them; that we may delight
   sincerely in them; that we may minister unto their wants, temporal and
   spiritual; that we may watch over them with pity and compassion. These
   and the like are the only ends for which we are at any time called to
   the consideration of the spiritual condition of one another; if these
   be neglected, the other is useless. And here lies a great aggravation
   of that neglect, in that such a way is made for the avoidance of it.
   Here lies the life or death of all church society. All church society
   and relation is built on this supposition, that the members of it are
   all regenerate. Some lay this foundation in baptism only, professing
   that all that are baptized are regenerate; others require a farther
   satisfaction, in the real work itself; but all build on the same
   foundation, that all church members are to be regenerate. And to what
   end is this? Namely, that they may all mutually perform those duties
   one towards another which are incumbent mutually on regenerate persona
   If these are omitted, there is an end of all profitable use of church
   society. Churches without this are but mere husks and shells of
   churches, carcases without souls; for as there is no real union unto
   Christ without faith, so there is no real union among the members of
   any church without love, and that acting itself in all the duties
   mentioned. Let not this ordinance be in vain.

   But we must return from this digression to that which lies before us,
   which is concerning what a man may discern concerning his own being
   regenerate or born again. I say, then, --

   Secondly, Men may come to an assured, satisfactory persuasion that
   themselves are regenerate, and that such as is so far infallible as
   that it will not deceive them when it is brought to the trial. For
   there are many duties whose performance in faith, unto the glory of God
   and the edification of our own souls, doth depend on this persuasion
   and conviction; as, --

   1. A due sense of our relation unto God, and an answerable comportment
   of our spirits and hearts towards him. He that is born again is born of
   God; he is begotten of God by the immortal seed of the word. Without a
   persuasion hereof, how can a man on grounds of faith carry himself
   towards God as his Father? And how great a part of our obedience
   towards him and communion with him depends hereon, we all know. If men
   fluctuate all their days in this matter, if they come to no settlement
   in it, no comfortable persuasion of it, they scarce ever act any
   genuine childlike acts of love or delight towards God, which
   exceedingly impeacheth their whole obedience.

   2. Thankfulness for grace received is one of the principal duties that
   is incumbent on believers in this world. Now, how can a man in faith
   bless God for that which he is utterly uncertain whether he have
   received it from him or no? I know some men run on in a rote in this
   matter. They will bless God in a formal way for regeneration,
   sanctification, justification, and the like; but if you ask them
   whether themselves are regenerate or no, they will be ready to scoff at
   it, or at least to profess that they know no such thing. What is this
   but to mock God, and in a presumptuous manner to take his name in vain?
   But if we will praise God as we ought for his grace, as we are guided
   and directed in the Scripture, as the nature of the matter requires,
   with such a frame of heart as may influence our whole obedience, surely
   it cannot but be our duty to know the grace that we have received.

   3. Again: the main of our spiritual watch and diligence consisteth in
   the cherishing, improving, and increasing of the grace that we have
   received, the strengthening of the new creature that is wrought in us.
   Herein consists principally the life of faith, and the exercise of that
   spiritual wisdom which faith furnisheth the soul withal. Now, how can
   any man apply himself hereunto whilst he is altogether uncertain
   whether he hath received any principle of living, saving grace, or no?
   Whereas, therefore, God requires our utmost diligence, watchfulness,
   and care in this matter it is certain that he requires also of us, and
   grants unto us, that which is the foundation of all these duties, which
   lies in an acquaintance with that state and condition whereunto we do
   belong. In brief, there is nothing we have to do, in reference unto
   eternity, but one way or other it hath a respect unto our light and
   convictions, as to our state and condition in this world; and those who
   are negligent in the trial' and examination thereof do leave all things
   between God and their souls at absolute uncertainties and dubious
   hazards, which is not to lead the life of faith.

   We shall now, upon these premises, return unto that part of the
   objection which is under consideration. Say some, "We know not whether
   we are regenerate or no, and are therefore altogether uncertain whether
   we have an interest in that forgiveness that is with God; nor dare we,
   on that account, admit of the consolation that is tendered on the truth
   insisted on."

   Supposing what hath been spoken in general, I shall lay down the
   grounds of resolving this perplexing doubt in the ensuing rules:--
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule I.

   See that the persuasion and assurance hereof which you look after and
   desire be regular, and not such as is suited merely unto your own
   imaginations. Our second and third general rules about the nature of
   all spiritual assurance, and what is consistent therewithal, are here
   to be taken into consideration. If you look to have such an evidence,
   light into, and absolute conviction of, this matter, as shall admit of
   no doubts, fears, questionings, just occasions and causes of new
   trials, teachings, and self-examinations, you will be greatly deceived.
   Regeneration induceth a new principle into the soul, but it doth not
   utterly expel the old; some would have security, not assurance. The
   principle of sin and unbelief will still abide in us, and still work in
   us. Their abiding and their acting must needs put the soul upon a
   severe inquiry, whether they are not prevalent in it beyond what the
   condition of regeneration will admit. The constant conflicts we must
   have with sin will not suffer us to have always so clear an evidence of
   our condition as we would desire. Such a persuasion as is prevalent
   against strong objections to the contrary, keeping up the heart to a
   due performance of those duties in faith which belong unto the state of
   regeneration, is the substance of what in this kind you are to look
   after.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule II.

   If you are doubtful concerning your state and condition, do not expect
   an extraordinary determination of it by an immediate testimony of the
   Spirit of God. I do grant that God doth sometimes, by this means, bring
   in peace and satisfaction unto the soul. He gives his own Spirit
   immediately "to bear witness with ours that we are the children of
   God," both upon the account of regeneration and adoption. He doth so;
   but, as far as we can observe, in a way of sovereignty, when and to
   whom he pleaseth. Besides, that men may content and satisfy themselves
   with his ordinary teachings, consolations, and communications of his
   grace, he hath left the nature of that peculiar testimony of the Spirit
   very dark and difficult to be found out, few agreeing wherein it doth
   consist or what is the nature of it. No one man's experience is a rule
   unto others, and an undue apprehension of it is a matter of great
   danger. Yet it is certain that humble souls in extraordinary cases may
   have recourse unto it with benefit and relief thereby. This, then, you
   may desire, you may pray for, but not with such a frame of spirit as to
   refuse that other satisfaction which in the ways of truth and peace you
   may find. This is the putting of the hand into the side of Christ; but
   "blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed."
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule III.

   If you have at any time formerly received any especial or immediate
   pledge or testimony of God, given unto your souls as unto their
   sincerity, and consequently their regeneration, labour to recover it,
   and to revive a sense of it upon your spirits now in your darkness and
   trouble. I am persuaded there are but few believers, but that God doth,
   at one time or other, in one duty or other, entering into or coming out
   of one temptation or another, give some singular testimony unto their
   own souls and consciences concerning their sincerity and his acceptance
   of them. Sometimes he doth this in a duty, wherein he hath enabled the
   soul to make so near an approach unto him as that it hath been warmed,
   enlivened, sweetened, satisfied with the presence, the gracious
   presence, of God, and which God hath made unto him as a token of his
   uprightness; -- sometimes, when a man is entering into any great
   temptation, trial, difficult or dangerous duty, that death itself is
   feared in it, God comes in, by one means or other, by a secret
   intimation of his love, which he gives him to take along with him for
   his furniture and provision in his way, and thereby testifies to him
   his sincerity; and this serves, like the food of Elijah, for forty days
   in a wilderness condition; -- sometimes he is pleased to shine
   immediately into the soul in the midst of its darkness and sorrow;
   wherewith it is surprised, as not looking for any such expression of
   kindness, and is thereby relieved against its own pressing
   self-condemnation; -- and sometimes the Lord is pleased to give these
   tokens of love unto the soul as its refreshment, when it is coming off
   from the storm of temptations wherewith it has been tossed. And many
   other times and seasons there are wherein God is pleased to give unto
   believers some especial testimony in their consciences unto their own
   integrity. But now these are all wrought by a transient operation of
   the Spirit, exciting and enabling the heart unto a spiritual, sensible
   apprehension and receiving of God's expressing kindness towards it.
   These things abide not in their sense and in their power which they
   have upon our affections, but immediately pass away. They are,
   therefore, to be treasured up in the mind and judgment, to be improved
   and made use of by faith, as occasion shall require. But we are apt to
   lose them. Most know no other use of them but whilst they feel them;
   yea, through ignorance in our duty to improve them, they prove like a
   sudden light brought into a dark place and again removed, which seems
   to increase, and really aggravates, our sense of the darkness. The true
   use of them is, to lay them up and ponder them in our hearts, that they
   may be supportments and testimonies unto us in a time of need. Have
   you, then, who are now in the dark as to your state or condition,
   whether you are regenerate or no, ever received any such refreshing and
   cheering testimony from God given unto your integrity, and your
   acceptance with him thereupon? Call it over again, and make use of it
   against those discouragements which arise from your present darkness in
   this matter, and which keep you off from sharing in the consolation
   tendered unto you in this word of grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

  Rule IV.

   A due spiritual consideration of the causes and effects of regeneration
   is the ordinary way and means whereby the souls of believers come to be
   satisfied concerning that work of God in them and upon them. The
   principle or causes of this work are, the Spirit and the word. He that
   is born again, "is born of the Spirit," John iii. 6; and of the word,
   "Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth," James i. 18; "We
   are born again by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever,"
   1 Pet. i. 23. Wherever, then, a man is regenerate, there hath been an
   effectual work of the Spirit and of the word upon the soul. This is to
   be inquired into and after. Ordinarily it will discover itself. Such
   impressions will be made in it upon the soul, such a change will be
   wrought and produced in it, as will not escape a spiritual diligent
   search and inquiry. And this is much of the duty of such as are in the
   dark, and uncertain concerning the accomplishment of this work in
   themselves. Let them call to mind what have been the actings of the
   Spirit by the word upon their souls; what light thereby hath been
   communicated unto their minds; what discoveries of the Lord Christ and
   way of salvation have been made to them; what sense and detestation of
   sin have been wrought in them; what satisfaction hath been given unto
   the soul, to choose, accept, and acquiesce in the righteousness of
   Christ; what resignation of the heart unto God, according to the tenor
   of the covenant of grace, it hath been wrought unto. Call to mind what
   transactions there have been between God and your souls about these
   things; how far they have been carried on; whether you have broken off
   the treaty with God, and refused his terms, or if not, where the stay
   is between you; and what is the reason, since God hath graciously begun
   to deal thus with you, that you are not yet come to a thorough close
   with him in the work and design of his grace? The defect must of
   necessity lie on your parts God doth nothing in vain. Had he not been
   willing to receive you, he would not have dealt with you so far as he
   hath done. There is nothing, then, remains to firm your condition but a
   resolved act of your own wills in answering the mind and will of God.
   And by this search may the soul come to satisfaction in this matter, or
   at least find out and discover where the stick is whence their
   uncertainty doth arise, and what is wanting to complete their desire.

   Again: this work may be discovered by its effects. There is something
   that is produced by it in the soul, which may also be considered either
   with respect unto its being and existence, or unto its actings and
   operations In the first regard it is spirit: John iii. 6, "That which
   is born of the Spirit," which is produced by the effectual operation of
   the Spirit of God, it "is spirit," -- "a new creature," 2 Cor. v 17. He
   that is in Christ Jesus, who is born again, is a new creature, a, new
   life, a spiritual life, Gal. ii. 20; Eph. ii. 1. In brief, it is an
   habitual furnishment of all the faculties of the soul with new
   spiritual, vital principles, enabling a person in all instances of
   obedience to lead a spiritual life unto God. This principle is by this
   work produced in the soul. And in respect of its actings, it consists
   in all the gracious operations of the mind, will, heart, or affections,
   in the duties of obedience which God hath required of us This is that
   which gives life unto our duties (without which the best of our works
   are but dead works), and renders them acceptable unto the living God.
   It is not my business at large to pursue and declare these things; I
   only mention them, that persons who are kept back from a participation
   of the consolation tendered from the forgiveness that is with God,
   because they cannot comfortably conclude that they are born again, as
   knowing that it is such persons alone unto whom these consolations do
   truly and really belong, may know how to make a right judgment of
   themselves. Let such persons, then, not fluctuate up and down in
   generals and uncertainties, with heartless complaints, which is the
   ruin of the peace of their souls; but let them really put things to the
   trial, by the examination of the causes and effects of the work they
   inquire after. It is by the use of such means whereby God will be'
   pleased to give them all the assurance and establishment concerning
   their state and condition which is needful for them, and which may give
   them encouragement in their course of obedience.

   But supposing all that hath been spoken, what if a man, by the utmost
   search and inquiry that he is able to make, cannot attain any
   satisfactory persuasion that indeed this great work of God's grace hath
   passed upon his soul; is this a sufficient ground to keep him off from
   accepting of supportment and consolation from this truth, that there is
   forgiveness with God? which is the design of the objection laid down
   before. I say therefore farther, that, --

   1. Regeneration doth not in order of time precede the soul's interest
   in the forgiveness that is with God, or its being made partaker of the
   pardon of sin. I say no more but that it doth not precede it in order
   of time, not determining which hath precedency in order of nature.
   That, I confess, which the method of the gospel leads unto is, that
   absolution, acquitment, or the pardon of sin, is the foundation of the
   communication of all saving grace unto the soul, and so precedeth all
   grace in the sinner whatever. But because this absolution or pardon of
   sin is to be received by faith, whereby the soul is really made
   partaker of it and all the benefits belonging thereunto, and that faith
   is the radical grace which we receive in our regeneration, -- for it is
   by faith that our hearts are purified, as an instrument in the hand of
   the great purifier, the Spirit of God, -- I place these two together,
   and shall not dispute as to their priority in nature; but in time the
   one doth not precede the other.

   2. It is hence evident, that an assurance of being regenerate is no way
   previously necessary unto the believing of an interest in forgiveness;
   so that although a man have not the former, it is, or may be, his duty
   to endeavour the latter. When convinced persons cried out, "What shall
   we do to be saved?" the answer was, "Believe, and ye shall be so."
   "Believe in Christ, and in the remission of sin by his blood," is the
   first thing that convinced sinners are called unto. They are not
   directed first to secure their souls that they are born again, and then
   afterward to believe; but they are first to believe that the remission
   of sin is tendered unto them in the blood of Christ, and that "by him
   they may be justified from all things from which they could not be
   justified by the law." Nor upon this proposition is it the duty of men
   to question whether they have faith or no, but actually to believe. And
   faith in its operation will evidence itself. See Acts xiii. 38, 39.
   Suppose, then, that you do not know that you are regenerate, that you
   are born of God, -- that you have no prevailing, refreshing, constant
   evidence or persuasion thereof, -- should this hinder you? should this
   discourage you from believing forgiveness, from dosing with the
   promises, and thereby obtaining in yourselves an interest in that
   forgiveness that is with God? Not at all; nay, this ought exceedingly
   to excite and stir you up unto your duty herein: for, --

   (1.) Suppose that it is otherwise, -- that, indeed, you are yet in the
   state of sin, and are only brought under the power of light and
   conviction, -- this is the way for a translation into an estate of
   spiritual life and grace. If you will forbear the acting of faith upon
   and for forgiveness until you are regenerate, you may, and probably you
   will, come short both of forgiveness and regeneration also. Here lay
   your foundation, and then your building will go on. This will open the
   door unto you, and give you an entrance into the kingdom of God. Christ
   is the door; do not think to climb up over the wall; enter by him, or
   you will be kept out.

   (2.) Suppose that you are born again, but yet know it not, -- as is the
   condition of many, -- this is a way whereby you may receive an evidence
   thereof. It is good, the embracing of all signs, tokens, and pledges of
   our spiritual condition, and it is so to improve them; but the best
   course is, to follow the genuine natural actings of faith, which will
   lead us into the most settled apprehensions concerning our relation
   unto God and acceptance with him. Believe first the forgiveness of sin
   as the effect of mere grace and mercy in Christ. Let the faith hereof
   be nourished and strengthened in your souls. This will insensibly
   influence your hearts into a comforting gospel persuasion of your state
   and condition towards God; which will be accompanied with assured rest
   and peace.

   To wind up this discourse -- Remember that that which hath been spoken
   with reference unto the state of regeneration in general may be applied
   unto every particular objection or cause of fear and discouragement
   that may be reduced to that head. Such are all objections that arise
   from particular sins, from aggravations of sins by their greatness or
   circumstances, or relapses into them. The way that the consideration of
   these things prevails upon the mind unto fear, is by begetting an
   apprehension in men that they are not regenerate; for if they were,
   they suppose they could not be so overtaken or entangled. The rules
   thereof laid down are suited to the straits of the souls of sinners in
   all such particular cases.

   Lastly, There was somewhat in particular added in the close of the
   objection, which, although it be not directly in our way nor of any
   great importance in itself, yet having been mentioned, it is not unmeet
   to remove it out of the way, that it may not leave entanglement upon
   the minds of any. Now this is, that some know not nor can give an
   account of the time of their conversion unto God, and therefore cannot
   be satisfied that the saving work of his grace hath passed upon them.
   This is usually and ordinarily spoken unto; and I shall therefore
   briefly give an account concerning it:--

   1. It hath been showed that, in this matter, there are many things
   whereon we may regularly found a judgment concerning ourselves, and it
   is great folly to waive them all, and put the issue of the matter upon
   one circumstance. If a man have a trial at law, wherein he hath many
   evidences speaking for him, only one circumstance is dubious and in
   question, he will not cast the weight of his cause on that disputed
   circumstance, but will plead those evidences that are more clear and
   testify more fully in his behalf. I will not deny but that this matter
   of the time of conversion is ofttimes an important circumstance, -- in
   the affirmative, when it is known, it is of great use, tending to
   stability and consolation; -- but yet it is still but a circumstance,
   such as that the being of the thing itself doth not depend upon. He
   that is alive may know that he was born, though he know neither the
   place where nor the time when he was so; and so may he that is
   spiritually alive, and hath ground of evidence that he is so, that he
   was born again, though he know neither when, nor where, nor how. And
   this case is usual in persons of quiet natural tempers, who have had
   the advantage of education under means of light and grace. God
   ofttimes, in such persons, begins and carries on the work of his grace
   insensibly, so that they come to good growth and maturity before they
   know that they are alive. Such persons come at length to be satisfied
   in saying, with the blind man in the gospel, "How our eyes were opened
   we know not; only one thing we know, whereas we were blind by nature,
   now we see."

   2. Even in this matter also, we must, it may be, be content to live by
   faith, and to believe as well what God hath done in us, if it be the
   matter and subject of his promises, as what he hath done for us; the
   ground whereof also is the promise, and nothing else.

   Objections from the present state and condition of the soul -- Weakness
   and imperfection of duty -- Opposition from indwelling sin.

   Thirdly. There is another head of objections against the soul's
   receiving consolation from an interest in forgiveness, arising from the
   consideration of its present state and condition as to actual holiness,
   duties, and sins. Souls complain, when in darkness and under
   temptations, that they cannot find that holiness, nor those fruits of
   it in themselves, which they suppose an interest in pardoning mercy
   will produce. Their hearts they find are weak, and all their duties
   worthless. If they were weighed in the balance, they would be all found
   too light. In the best of them there is such a mixture of self,
   hypocrisy, unbelief, vain-glory, that they are even ashamed and
   confounded with the remembrance of them. These things fill them with
   discouragements, so that they refuse to be comforted or to entertain
   any refreshing persuasion from the truth insisted on, but rather
   conclude that they are utter strangers from that forgiveness that is
   with God, and so continue helpless in their depths.

   According unto the method proposed, and hitherto pursued, I shall only
   lay down some such general rules as may support a soul under the
   despondencies that are apt in such a condition to befall it, that none
   of these things may weaken it in its endeavour to lay hold of
   forgiveness. And, --

   1. This is the proper place to put in execution our eighth rule, to
   take heed of heartless complaints when vigorous actings of grace are
   expected at our hands. If it be thus, indeed, why lie you on your
   faces? why do you not rise and put out yourselves to the utmost, giving
   all diligence to add one grace to another, until you find yourselves in
   a better frame? Supposing, then, the putting of that rule into
   practice, I add, --

   (1.) That known holiness is apt to degenerate into self-righteousness.
   What God gives us on the account of sanctification we are ready enough
   to reckon on the score of justification. It is a hard thing to feel
   grace, and to believe as if there were none. We have so much of the
   Pharisee in us by nature, that it is sometimes well that our good is
   hid from us. We are ready to take our corn and wine and bestow them on
   other lovers. Were there not in our hearts a spiritually sensible
   principle of corruption, and in our duties a discernible mixture of
   self, it would be impossible we should walk so humbly as is required of
   them who hold communion with God in a covenant of grace and pardoning
   mercy. It is a good life which is attended with a faith of
   righteousness and a sense of corruption. Whilst I know Christ's
   righteousness, I shall the less care to know my own holiness. To be
   holy is necessary; to know it, sometimes a temptation

   (2.) Even duties of God's appointment, when turned into
   self-righteousness, are God's great abhorrency, Isa. lxvi. 2, 3. What
   hath a good original may be vitiated by a bad end.

   (3.) Oftentimes holiness in the heart is more known by the opposition
   that is made there to it, than by its own prevalent working. The
   Spirit's operation is known by the flesh's opposition. We find a man's
   strength by the burdens he carries, and not the pace that he goes. "O
   wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this
   death?" is a better evidence of grace and holiness than "God, I thank
   thee I am not as other men." A heart pressed, grieved, burdened, not by
   the guilt of sin only, which reflects with trouble on an awakened
   conscience, but by the close, adhering power of indwelling sin,
   tempting, seducing, soliciting, hindering, captivating, conceiving,
   restlessly disquieting, may from thence have as clear an evidence of
   holiness as from a delightful fruit-bearing. What is it that is
   troubled and grieved in thee? what is it that seems to be almost killed
   and destroyed; that cries out, complains, longs for deliverance? Is it
   not the new creature? is it not the principle of spiritual life,
   whereof thou art partaker? I speak not of troubles and disquietments
   for sin committed; nor of fears and perturbations of mind lest sin
   should break forth to loss, shame, ruin, dishonour; nor of the
   contending of a convinced conscience lest damnation should ensue; --
   but of the striving of the Spirit against sin, out of a hatred and a
   loathing of it, upon all the mixed considerations of love, grace,
   mercy, fear, the beauty of holiness, excellency of communion with God,
   that are proposed in the gospel. If thou seemest to thyself to be only
   passive in these things, to do nothing but to endure the assaults of
   sin; yet if thou art sensible, and standest under the stroke of it as
   under the stroke of an enemy, there is the root of the matter. And as
   it is thus as to the substance and being of holiness, so it is also as
   to the degrees of it. Degrees of holiness are to be measured more by
   opposition than self-operation. He may have more grace than another who
   brings not forth so much fruit as the other, because he hath more
   opposition, more temptation, Isa. xli. 17. And sense of the want of all
   is a great sign of somewhat in the soul.

   2. As to what was alleged as to the nothingness, the selfishness of
   duty, I say, it is certain, whilst we are in the flesh, our duties will
   taste of the vessel whence they proceed. Weakness, defilements,
   treachery, hypocrisy, will attend them. To this purpose, whatever some
   pretend to the contrary, is the complaint of the church, Isa. lxiv. 6.
   The chaff oftentimes is so mixed with the wheat that corn can scarce be
   discerned. And this know, that the more spiritual any man is, the more
   he sees of his unspiritualness in his spiritual duties. An outside
   performance will satisfy an outside Christian. Job abhorred himself
   most when he knew himself best. The clearer discoveries we have had of
   God, the viler will every thing of self appear. Nay, farther, duties
   and performances are oftentimes very ill measured by us; and those seem
   to be first which indeed are last, and those to be last which indeed
   are first. I do not doubt but a man, when he hath had distractions to
   wrestle withal, no outward advantage to farther him, no extraordinary
   provocation of hope, fear, or sorrow, on a natural account in his duty,
   may rise from his knees with thoughts that he hath done nothing in his
   duty but provoked God; when there hath been more workings of grace, in
   contending with the deadness cast on the soul by the condition that it
   is in, than when, by a concurrence of moved natural affections and
   outward provocations, a frame hath been raised that hath, to the party
   himself, seemed to reach to heaven: so that it may be this perplexity
   about duties is nothing but what is common to the people of God, and
   which ought to be no obstruction to peace and settlement.

   3. As to the pretence of hypocrisy, you know what is usually answered.
   It is one thing to do a thing in hypocrisy, another not to do it
   without a mixture of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy, in its long extent, is every
   thing that, for matter or manner, comes short of sincerity. Now, our
   sincerity is no more perfect than our other graces; so that in its
   measure it abides with us and adheres to all we do. In like manner, it
   is one thing to do a thing for vain-glory and to be seen of men,
   another not to be able wholly to keep off the subtle insinuations of
   self and vain-glory. He that doth a thing in hypocrisy and for
   vain-glory is satisfied with some corrupt end obtained, though he be
   sensible that he sought such an end. He that doth a thing with a
   mixture of hypocrisy, -- that is, with some breaches upon the degrees
   of his sincerity, with some insensible advancements in performance on
   outward considerations, -- is not satisfied with a self-end obtained,
   and is dissatisfied with the defect of his sincerity. In a word,
   wouldst thou yet be sincere, and dost endeavour so to be in private
   duties, and in public performances, -- in praying, hearing, giving
   alms, zealous actings for God's glory and the love of the saints;
   though these duties are not, it may be, sometimes done without sensible
   hypocrisy, -- I mean, as traced to its most subtle insinuations of self
   and vain-glory, -- yet are they not done in hypocrisy, nor do they
   denominate the persons by whom they are performed hypocrites. Yet I say
   of this, as of all that is spoken before, it is of use to relieve us
   under a troubled condition, -- of none to support us or encourage us
   unto an abode in it.

   4. Know that God despiseth not small things. He takes notice of the
   least breathings of our hearts after him, when we ourselves can see nor
   perceive no such thing. He knows the mind of the Spirit in those
   workings which are never formed to that height that we can reflect upon
   them with our observation. Every thing that is of him is noted in his
   book, though not in ours. He took notice that, when Sarah was acting
   unbelief towards him, yet that she showed respect and regard to her
   husband, calling him "lord," Gen. xviii. 12; 1 Pet. iii. 6. And even
   whilst his people are sinning, he can find something in their hearts,
   words, or ways, that pleaseth him; much more in their duties. He is a
   skilful refiner, that can find much gold in that ore where we see
   nothing but lead or clay. He remembers the duties which we forget, and
   forgets the sins which we remember. He justifies our persons, though
   ungodly; and will also our duties, though not perfectly godly.

   5. To give a little farther support in reference unto our wretched,
   miserable duties, and to them that are in perplexities on that account,
   know that Jesus Christ takes whatever is evil and unsavoury out of
   them, and makes them acceptable. When an unskilful servant gathers many
   herbs, flowers, and weeds in a garden, you gather them out that are
   useful, and cast the rest out of sight. Christ deals so with our
   performances. All the ingredients of self that are in them on any
   account he takes away, and adds incense to what remains, and presents
   it to God, Exod. xxx. 36. This is the cause that the saints at the last
   day, when they meet their own duties and performances, they know them
   not, they are so changed from what they were when they went out of
   their hand. "Lord, when saw we thee naked or hungry?" So that God
   accepts a little, and Christ makes our little a great deal.

   6. Is this an argument to keep thee from believing? The reason why thou
   art no more holy is because thou hast no more faith. If thou hast no
   holiness, it is because thou hast no faith. Holiness is the purifying
   of the heart by faith, or our obedience unto the truth. And the reason
   why thou art no more in duty is, because thou art no more in believing.
   The reason why thy duties are weak and imperfect is, because thy faith
   is weak and imperfect. Hast thou no holiness? -- believe, that thou
   mayst have. Hast thou but a little, or that which is imperceptible? --
   be steadfast in believing, that thou mayst abound in obedience. Do not
   resolve not to eat thy meat until thou art strong, when thou hast no
   means of being strong but by eating thy bread, which strengthens the
   heart of man.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Objection Fourth. The powerful tumultuating of indwelling sin or
   corruption is another cause of the same kind of trouble and
   despondency." They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the
   lusts thereof.' But we find," say some, "several corruptions working
   effectually in our hearts, carrying us captive to the law of sin. They
   disquiet with their power as well as with their guilt. Had we been made
   partakers of the law of the Spirit of life, we had, ere this, been more
   set free from the law of sin and death. Had sin been pardoned fully, it
   would have been subdued more effectually."

   There are three considerations which make the actings of indwelling sin
   to be so perplexing to the soul --

   1. Because they are unexpected. The soul looks not for them upon the
   first great conquest made of sin, and universal engagement of the heart
   unto God. When it first says, "I have sworn, and am steadfastly
   purposed to keep thy righteous judgments," commonly there is peace, at
   least for a season, from the disturbing vigorous actings of sin. There
   are many reasons why so it should be. "Old things are then passed away,
   all things are become new;" and the soul, under the power of that
   universal change, is utterly turned away from those things that should
   foment, stir up, provoke, or cherish, any lust or temptation. Now, when
   some of these advantages are past, and sin begins to stir and act
   again, the soul is surprised, and thinks the work that he hath passed
   through was not true and effectual, but temporary only; yea, he thinks,
   perhaps, that sin hath more strength than it had before, because he is
   more sensible than he was before. As one that hath a dead arm or limb,
   whilst it is mortified, endures deep cuts and lancings, and feels them
   not; so when spirits and sense are brought into the place again, he
   feels the least cut, and may think the instruments sharper than they
   were before, when all the difference is, that he hath got a quickness
   of sense, which before he had not. It may be so with a person in this
   case: he may think lust more powerful than it was before, because he is
   more sensible than he was before. Yea, sin in the heart is like a snake
   or serpent: you may pull out the sting of it, and cut it into many
   pieces; though it can sting mortally no more, nor move its whole body
   at once, yet it will move in all its parts, and make an appearance of a
   greater motion than formerly. So it is with lust: when it hath received
   its death's wound, and is cut to pieces, yet it moves in so many parts
   as it were in the soul, that it amazes him that hath to do with it; and
   thus coming unexpectedly, fills the spirit oftentimes with
   disconsolation.

   2 It hath also in its actings a universality. This also surpriseth.
   There is a universality in the actings of sin, even in believers. There
   is no evil that it will not move to; there is no good that it will not
   attempt to hinder; no duty that it will not defile. And the reason of
   this is, because we are sanctified but in part; not in any part wholly,
   though savingly and truly in every part. There is sin remaining in
   every faculty, in all the affections, and so may be acting in and
   towards any sin that the nature of man is liable unto. Degrees of sin
   there are that all regenerate persons are exempted from; but unto
   solicitations to all kinds of sin they are exposed: and this helps on
   the temptation.

   3. It is endless and restless, never quiet, conquering nor conquered;
   it gives not over, but rebels being overcome, or assaults afresh having
   prevailed. Ofttimes after a victory obtained and an opposition subdued,
   the soul is in expectation of rest and peace from its enemies: but this
   holds not; it works and rebels again and again, and will do so whilst
   we live in this world, so that no issue will be put to our conflict but
   by death. This is at large handled elsewhere, in a treatise lately
   published on this peculiar subject. [5]

   These and the like considerations attending the actings of indwelling
   sin, do oftentimes entangle the soul in making a judgment of itself,
   and leave it in the dark as to its state and condition.

   A few things shall be offered unto this objection also:--

   1. The sensible powerful actings of indwelling sin are not inconsistent
   with a state of grace, Gal. v. 17. There are in the same person
   contrary principles, -- "the flesh and the Spirit;" these are contrary.
   And there are contrary actings from these principles, -- "the flesh
   lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh;" and
   these actings are described to be greatly vigorous in other places.
   Lust wars against our souls, James iv. 1; 1 Pet. ii. 11. Now, to war is
   not to make faint or gentle opposition, to be slighted and contemned;
   but it is to go out with great strength, to use craft, subtlety, and
   force, so as to put the whole issue to a hazard. So these lusts war;
   such are their actings in and against the soul. And therefore, saith
   the apostle, "Ye cannot do the things that ye would." See Rom. vii.
   14-17. In this conflict, indeed, the understanding is left unconquered,
   -- it condemns and disapproves of the evil led auto; and the will is
   not subdued, -- it would not do the evil that is pressed upon it; and
   there is a hatred or aversion remaining in the affections unto sin: but
   yet, notwithstanding, sin rebels, fights, tumultuates, and leads
   captive. This objection, then, may receive this speedy answer --
   Powerful actings and workings, universal, endless strugglings of
   indwelling sin, seducing to all that is evil, putting itself forth to
   the disturbance and dissettlement of all that is good, are not
   sufficient ground to conclude a state of alienation from God. See for
   this the other treatise before mentioned at large.

   2. Your state is not at all to be measured by the opposition that sin
   makes to you, but by the opposition you make to it. Be that never so
   great, if this be good, -- be that never so restless and powerful, if
   this be sincere, -- you may be disquieted, you can have no reason to
   despond.

   I have mentioned these things only to give a specimen of the objections
   which men usually raise up against an actual closing with the truth
   insisted on to their consolation. And we have also given in upon them
   some rules of truth for their relief; not intending in them absolute
   satisfaction as to the whole of the cases mentioned, but only to remove
   the darkness raised by them so out of the way, as that it might not
   hinder any from mixing the word with faith that hath been dispensed
   from this blessed testimony, that "there is forgiveness with God, that
   he may be feared."

                            Verses fifth and sixth.

   Proceed we now to the second part of this psalm, which contains the
   deportment of a sin-perplexed soul, when by faith it hath discovered
   where its rest doth lie, and from whom its relief is to be expected;
   even from the forgiveness which is with God, whereof we have spoken.

   There are two things in general, as was before mentioned, that the soul
   in that condition applies itself unto; whereof the first respects
   itself, and the other the whole Israel of God.

   That which respects itself is the description of that frame of heart
   and spirit that he was brought into upon faith's discovery of
   forgiveness in God, with the duties that he applied himself unto, the
   grounds of it, and the manner of its performance, verses 5, 6 --

   "I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. My
   soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I
   say, more than they that watch for the morning."

   Herein, I say, he describes both his frame of spirit and the duty he
   applied himself to, both as to matter and manner.

   I shall, as in the method hitherto observed, first consider the reading
   of the words, then their sense and importance, with the suitableness of
   the things mentioned in them to the condition of the soul under
   consideration; all which yield us a foundation of the observations that
   are to be drawn from them.

   1. The words rendered strictly, or word for word, lie thus --

   "I have earnestly expected Jehovah; my soul hath expected, and in his
   word have I tarried," or waited. "My soul to the Lord more than" (or
   before) "the watchmen in the morning; the watchmen in the morning," or
   "unto the morning."

   "I have waited" or "expected:" qvyty? from qvh?, "to expect," "to
   hope," "to wait." "Verbum hoc est, magno animi desiderio in aliquem
   intentum esse, et respicere ad eum, ex eo pendere;" -- "The word
   denotes to be intent on any one with great desire; to behold or regard
   him, and to depend upon him;" and it also expresseth the earnest
   inclination and intension of the will and mind.

   Paul seems to have expressed this word to the full, Rom. viii. 19, by
   apokaradokia, -- an intent or earnest expectation, expressing itself by
   putting forth the head, and looking round about with earnestness and
   diligence. And this is also signified expressly by this word, Ps. lxix.
   21, v'qvh lnvd?; -- "And I looked for some to take pity." "Huc illuc
   anxiÃ¨ circumspexi, siquis forte me commiseraturus esset;" -- "I looked
   round about, this way and that way, diligently and solicitously, to see
   if any would pity me or lament with me."

   Thus, "I have wilted," is as much as, "I have diligently, with
   intension of soul, mind, will, and affections, looked unto God, in
   earnest expectation of that from him that I stand in need of, and which
   must come forth from the forgiveness that is with him."

   2. "I have," saith he, "waited for, or expected Jehovah." He uses the
   same name of God in his expectation that he first fixed on in his
   application to him.

   And it is not this or that means, not this or that assistance, but it
   is Jehovah himself that he expects and waits for. It is Jehovah himself
   that must satisfy the soul, -- his favour and loving-kindness, and what
   flows from them; if he come not himself, if he give not himself,
   nothing else will relieve.

   3. "My soul doth wait," or expect; -- "It is no outward duty that I am
   at, no lip-labour, no bodily work, no formal, cold, careless
   performance of a duty. No; my soul doth wait.' It is soul-work,
   heart-work I am at. I wait, I wait with my whole soul."

   4. "In His words do I hope," or "Wait." There is not any thing of
   difficulty in these words. The word used, hvchlty?, is from ychl?,
   "sunt qui, quod affine sit verbo chll?,' velint anxietatem et nisum
   includere, ut significet anxiÃ¨, seu enixÃ¨ expectare, sustinere, et
   sperare;" -- It signifies to hope, expect, endure, and sustain with
   care, solicitousness, and endeavours. Hence the LXX. have rendered the
   word by hupemeinen, and the Vulgar Latin "sustinui;" -- "I have
   sustained and waited with patience."

   And this on the word; or, be sustained his soul with the word of
   promise that it should not utterly faint, seeing he had made a
   discovery of grace and forgiveness, though yet at a great distance; he
   had a sight of land, though he was yet in a storm at sea; and therefore
   encourageth himself, or his soul, that it doth not despond.

   But yet all this that we have spoken reaches not the intenseness of the
   soul of the psalmist, in this his expectation of Jehovah. The earnest
   engagement of his soul in this duty riseth up above what he can
   express. Therefore he proceeds, verse 6: "My soul," saith he, "for the
   Lord" (that is, expects him, looks for him, waits for him, waits for
   his coming to me in love and with forgiveness), "more than the watchers
   for the morning, the watchers for the morning."

   These latter words are variously rendered, and variously expounded. The
   LXX. and Vulgar Latin render them, "From the morning watch until
   night;" others, "From those that keep the morning watch, unto those
   that keep the evening watch;" "More than the watchers in the morning,
   more than the watchers in the morning."

   The words also are variously expounded. Austin would have it to signify
   the placing of our hopes on the morning of Christ's resurrection, and
   continuing in them until the night of our own death.

   Jerome, who renders the words, "From the morning watch to the morning
   watch," expounds them of continuing our hopes and expectations from the
   morning that we are called into the Lord's vineyard to the morning when
   we shall receive our reward; as much to the sense of the place as the
   former. And so Chrysostom interprets it of our whole life.

   It cannot be denied but that they were led into these mistakes by the
   translation of the LXX. and that of the Vulgar Latin, who both of them
   have divided these words quite contrary to their proper dependence, and
   read them thus, "My soul expected the Lord. From the morning watch to
   the night watch, let Israel trust in the Lord;" so making the words to
   belong to the following exhortation unto others, which are plainly a
   part of the expression of his own duty.

   The words, then, are a comparison, and an allusion unto watchmen, and
   may be taken in one of these two senses --

   1. In things civil, As those who keep the watch of the night do look,
   and long for, and expect the morning, when, being dismissed from their
   guard, they may take that sleep that they need and desire; which
   expresses a very earnest expectation, inquiry, and desire. Or,

   2. In things sacred, with the Chaldee paraphrast, which renders the
   words, "More than they that look for the morning watch," which they
   carefully observe, that they may offer the morning sacrifice. In this
   sense, "As," saith he, "the warders and watchers in the temple do look
   diligently after the appearance of the morning, that they may with joy
   offer the morning sacrifice in the appointed season; so, and with more
   diligence, doth my soul wait for Jehovah."

   You see the reading of the words, and how far the sense of them opens
   itself unto us by that consideration.

   Let us, then, next see briefly the several parts of them, as they stand
   in relation one to another. We have, then, --

   1. The expression of the duty wherein he was exercised; and that is,
   earnest waiting for Jehovah.

   2. The bottom and foundation of that his waiting and expectation; that
   is, the word of God, the word of promise, -- he diligently hoped in the
   word.

   3. The frame of his spirit in, and the manner of his performance of,
   this duty; expressed, -- (1.) In the words themselves that he uses,
   according as we opened them before. (2.) In the emphatical
   reduplication, yea, triplecation of his expression of it: "I wait for
   the Lord;" "My soul waiteth for God;" " My soul waiteth for the Lord."
   (3.) In the comparison instituted between his discharge of his duty and
   others' performances of a corporal watch, -- with the greatest care and
   diligence: "More than they that watch for the morning." So that we
   have, --

   1. The duty he performed, -- earnest waiting and expectation.

   2. The object of his waiting, -- Jehovah himself.

   3. His supportment in that duty, -- the word of promise.

   4. The manner of his performance of it:-- (1.) With earnestness and
   diligence. (2.) With perseverance.

   Let us, then, now consider the words as they contain the frame and
   working of a sin-entangled soul.

   Having been raised out of his depths by the discovery of forgiveness in
   God, as was before declared, yet not being immediately made partaker of
   that forgiveness, as to a comforting sense of it, he gathers up his
   soul from wandering from God, and supports it from sinking under his
   present condition.

   "It is," saith he, "Jehovah alone, with whom is forgiveness, that can
   relieve and do me good. His favour, his loving-kindness, his
   communication of mercy and grace from thence, is that which I stand in
   need of. On him, therefore, do I with all heedfulness attend; on him do
   I wait. My soul is filled with expectation from him. Surely he will
   come to me, he will come and refresh me. Though he seem as yet to be
   afar off, and to leave me in these depths, yet I have his word of
   promise to support and stay my soul; on which I will lean until I
   obtain the enjoyment of him, and his kindness which is better than
   life."

   And this is the frame of a sin-entangled soul who hath really by faith
   discovered forgiveness in God, but is not yet made partaker of a
   comforting, refreshing sense of it. And we may represent it in the
   ensuing observations --

   Obs. 1. The first proper fruit of faith's discovery of forgiveness in
   God, unto a sin-distressed soul, is waiting in patience and
   expectation.

   Obs. 2. The proper object of a sin-distressed soul's waiting and
   expecting is God himself, as reconciled in Christ: "I have waited for
   Jehovah."

   Obs. 3. The word of promise is the soul's great supportment in waiting
   for God: "In thy word do I hope."

   Obs. 4. Sin-distressed souls wait for God with earnest intension of
   mind, diligence, and expectation, -- from the redoubling of the
   expression.

   Obs. 5. Continuance in waiting until God appears to the soul is
   necessary and prevailing; -- necessary, as that without which we cannot
   attain assistance; and prevailing, as that wherein we shall never fail.

   Obs. 6. Establishment in waiting, when there is no present sense of
   forgiveness, yet gives the soul much secret rest and comfort. This
   observation ariseth from the influence that these verses have unto
   those that follow. The psalmist, having attained thus far, can now look
   about him and begin to deal with others, and exhort them to an
   expectation of grace and mercy

   And thus, though the soul be not absolutely in the haven of consolation
   where it would be, yet it hath cast out an anchor that gives it
   establishment and security. Though it be yet tossed, yet it is secured
   from shipwreck, and is rather sick than in danger. A waiting condition
   is a condition of safety.

   Hence it is that he now turns himself to others; and upon the
   experience of the discovery that he had made of forgiveness in God, and
   the establishment and consolation he found in waiting on him, he calls
   upon and encourageth others to the same duty, verses 7, 8.

   The propositions laid down I shall briefly pass through, still with
   respect unto the state and condition of the soul represented in the
   psalm. Many things that might justly he insisted on in the improvement
   of these truths have been anticipated in our former general rules. To
   them we must therefore sometimes have recourse, because they must not
   be again repeated. On this account, I say, we shall pass through them
   with all briefness possible; yet so as not wholly to omit any
   directions that are here tendered unto us as to the guidance of the
   soul, whose condition, and the working of whose faith, is here
   described. This, therefore, in the first place is proposed --

   The first proper fruit of faith's discovery of forgiveness in God, unto
   a sin-distressed soul, is waiting in patience and expectation.

   This the psalmist openly and directly applies himself unto, and
   expresseth to have been as his duty, so his practice. And he doth it so
   emphatically, as was manifested in the opening of the words, that I
   know not that any duty is anywhere in the Scripture so recommended and
   lively represented unto us.

   You must, therefore, for the right understanding of it, call to mind
   what hath been spoken concerning the state of the soul inquired into,
   -- its depths, entanglements, and sense of sin, with its application
   unto God about those things; as also remember what hath been delivered
   about the nature of forgiveness, with the revelation that is made of it
   unto the faith of believers, and that this may be done where the soul
   hath no refreshing sense of its own interest therein. It knows not that
   its own sins are forgiven, although it believes that there is
   forgiveness with God. Now, the principal duty that is incumbent on such
   a soul is that laid down in the proposition, -- namely, patient waiting
   and expectation.

   Two things must be done in reference hereunto -- First, The nature of
   the duty itself is to be declared; and, secondly, The necessity and
   usefulness of its practice is to be evinced and demonstrated.

   For the nature of it, something hath been intimated giving light into
   it, in the opening of the words here used by the psalmist to express it
   by. But we may observe, that these duties, as required of us, do not
   consist in any particular acting of the soul, but in the whole
   spiritual frame and deportment of it, in reference unto the end aimed
   at in and by them. And this waiting, as here and elsewhere commended
   unto us, and which is comprehensive of the especial duties of the soul,
   in the case insisted on and described, comprehends these three
   things:-- 1. Quietness, in opposition to haste and tumultuating of
   spirit. 2. Diligence, in opposition to spiritual sloth, despondency,
   and neglect of means. 3. Expectation, in opposition to despair,
   distrust, and other proper immediate actings of unbelief.

   1. Quietness. Hence this waiting itself is sometimes expressed by
   silence. To wait is to be silent: Lam. iii. 26, "It is good both to
   hope vdvmm?, and to be silent for the salvation of the Lord;" that is,
   to "wait quietly," as we have rendered the word. And the same word we
   render sometimes "to rest" as Ps. xxxvii. 7, "Rest on the Lord, dvm
   lyhvh?, be silent unto him," where it is joined with hoping or waiting,
   as that which belongs unto the nature of it; and so in sundry other
   places. And this God, in an especial manner, calleth souls unto in
   straits and distresses. "In quietness and confidence," saith he, "shall
   be your strength," Isa. xxx. 15. And the effect of the righteousness of
   God by Christ is said to be "quietness and assurance for ever," Isa.
   xxxii. 17; -- first quietness, and then assurance. Now, this silence
   and quietness which accompanieth waiting, yea, which is an essential
   part of it, is opposed, first, to haste; and haste is the soul's undue
   lifting up itself, proceeding from a weariness of its condition, to
   press after an end of its troubles not according to the conduct of the
   Spirit of God. Thus, when God calleth his people to waiting, he
   expresseth the contrary acting unto this duty by the lifting up of the
   soul: Hab. ii. 3, 4, "Though the vision tarry, wait for it. Behold, his
   soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live
   by his faith." God hath given unto the soul a vision of peace, through
   the discovery of that forgiveness which is with him; but he will have
   us wait for an actual participation of it unto rest and comfort. He
   that will not do so, but lifts up his soul, -- that is, in making haste
   beyond the rule and method of the Spirit of God in this matter, -- his
   heart is not upright in him, nor will he know what it is to live by
   faith. This ruins and disappoints many a soul in its attempts for
   forgiveness. The prophet, speaking of this matter, tells us that "he
   that believeth shall not," nor will not, "make haste," Isa. xxviii 16;
   -- which words the apostle twice making use of, Rom. ix. 33, x. 11, in
   both places renders them, "Whosoever believeth on him shalt not be
   ashamed," or confounded; and that because this haste turns men off from
   believing, and so disappoints their hopes, and leaves them unto shame
   and confusion. Men with a sense of the guilt of sin, having some
   discovery made to them of the rest, ease, and peace which they may
   obtain to their souls by forgiveness, are ready to catch greedily at
   it, and to make false, unsound, undue applications of it unto
   themselves. They cannot bear the yoke that the Lord hath put upon them,
   but grow impatient under it, and cry with Rachel, "Give me children, or
   else I die." Any way they would obtain it. Now, as the first duty of
   such a soul is to apply itself unto waiting, so the first entrance into
   wilting consists in this silence and quietness of heart and spirit.
   This is the soul's endeavour to keep itself bumble, satisfied with the
   sovereign pleasure of God in its condition, and refusing all ways and
   means of rest and peace but what it is guided and directed unto by the
   word and Spirit. Secondly, As it is opposed unto haste, so it is unto
   tumultuating thoughts and vexatious disquietments. The soul is silent.
   Ps. xxxix. 9, "I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst
   it." He redoubles the expression, whereby he sets out his endeavour to
   quiet and still his soul in the will of God. In the condition
   discoursed of, the soul is apt to have many tumultuating thoughts, or a
   multitude of perplexing thoughts, of no use or advantage unto it. How
   they are to be watched against and rejected was before declared in our
   general rules This quietness in waiting will prevent them. And this is
   the first thing in the duty prescribed.

   2. Diligence, in opposition unto spiritual sloth, is included in it
   also. Diligence is the activity of the mind, in the regular use of
   means, for the pursuit of any end proposed. The end aimed at by the
   soul is a comforting, refreshing interest in that forgiveness that is
   with God. For the attaining thereof, there are sundry means instituted
   and blessed of God. A neglect of them, through regardlessness or sloth,
   will certainly disappoint the soul from attaining that end. It is
   confessedly so in things natural. He that soweth not must not think to
   reap; he that clotheth not himself will not be warm; nor he enjoy
   health who neglects the means of it. Men understand this as to their
   outward concerns; and although they have a due respect unto the
   blessing of God, yet they expect not to be rich without industry in
   their ways. It is so also in things spiritual. God hath appointed one
   thing to be the means of obtaining another; in the use of them doth he
   bless us, and from the use of them doth his glory arise, because they
   are his own appointments. And this diligence wholly respecteth
   practice, or the regular use of means. A man is said to be diligent in
   business, to have a diligent hand; though it be an affection of the
   mind, yet it simply respects practice and operation. This diligence in
   his waiting David expresseth, Ps. xl. 1, qvh qvyty?. We render it, "I
   have waited patiently," that is, "Waiting I have waited;" that is,
   diligently, earnestly, in the use of means. So he describes this duty
   by an elegant similitude, Ps. cxxiii. 2, "Behold, as the eyes of
   servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a
   maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord
   our God, until that he have mercy upon us." Servants that wait on their
   masters and look to their hands, it is to expect an intimation of their
   minds as to what they would have them do, that they may address
   themselves unto it. "So," saith he, "do we wait for mercy;" -- not in a
   slothful neglect of duties, but in a constant readiness to observe the
   will of God in all his commands. An instance hereof we have in the
   spouse when she was in the condition here described, Cant. iii. 1, 2.
   She wanted the presence of her Beloved; which amounts to the same state
   which we have under consideration; for where the presence of Christ is
   not, there can be no sense of forgiveness. At first she seeks him upon
   her bed: "By night upon my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I
   sought him, but I found him not." She seems herein to have gone no
   farther than desires, for she was in her bed, where she could do no
   more; and the issue is, she found him not. But doth she so satisfy
   herself, and lie still, waiting until he should come there unto her?
   No; she says, "I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets,
   and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth." She
   resolves to put herself into the use of all means whereby one may be
   sought that is wanting. In the city, streets, and fields, she would
   inquire after him. And the blessed success she had herein is reported,
   verse 4; she "found him, she held him, she would not let him go." This,
   then, belongs unto the waiting of the soul: diligence in the use of
   means, whereby God is pleased ordinarily to communicate a sense of
   pardon and forgiveness, is a principal part of it, What these means are
   is known. Prayer, meditation, reading, hearing of the word,
   dispensation of the sacraments, they are all appointed to this purpose;
   they are all means of communicating love and grace to the soul. Be not,
   then, heartless or slothful: up and be doing; attend with diligence to
   the word of grace; be fervent in prayer, assiduous in the use of all
   ordinances of the church; in one or other of them, at one time or
   other, thou wilt meet with Him whom thy soul loveth, and God through
   Him will speak peace unto thee.

   3. There is expectation in it; which lies in a direct opposition to all
   the actings of unbelief in this matter, and is the very life and soul
   of the duty under consideration. So the psalmist declares it, Ps. lxii.
   5, "My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is only from
   him." The soul will not, cannot, in a due manner wait upon God, unless
   it has expectations from him, -- unless, as James speaks, he looks to
   receive somewhat from him, chap. i. 7. The soul in this condition
   regards forgiveness not only as by itself it is desired, but
   principally as it is by God promised. Thence they expect it. This is
   expressed in the fourth proposition before laid down, -- namely, that
   sin-distressed souls wait for God with earnestness, intension of mind,
   and expectation. As this ariseth from the redoubling of the expression,
   so principally from the nature of the comparison that he makes on
   himself in his waiting with them that watch for the morning. Those that
   watch for the morning do not only desire it and prepare for it, but
   they expect it, and know assuredly that it will come. Though darkness
   may for a time be troublesome, and continue longer than they would
   desire, yet they know that the morning hath its appointed time of
   return, beyond which it will not tarry; and, therefore, they look out
   for its appearance on all occasions. So it is with the soul in this
   matter. So says David, Ps. v. 3, "I will direct my prayer unto thee
   v'tsphh?, and look up:" so we. The words before are defective: vqr 'rk
   lph?, "In the morning," or rather every morning, "I will order unto
   thee." We restrain this unto prayer: "I will direct my prayer unto
   thee." But this was expressed directly in the words foregoing: "In the
   morning thou shalt hear my voice;" that is, "the voice of my prayer and
   supplications," as it is often supplied. And although the psalmist doth
   sometimes repeat the same thing in different expressions, yet here he
   seemeth not so to do, but rather proceeds to declare the general frame
   of his spirit in walking with God. "I will," saith he, "order all
   things towards God, so as that I may wait upon him in the ways of his
   appointment, v'tsphh?, and will look up." It seems in our translation
   to express his posture in his prayer; but the word is of another
   importance. It is diligently to look out after that which is coming
   towards us, and looking out after the accomplishment of our
   expectation. This is a part of our waiting for God; yea, as was said,
   the life of it, that which is principally intended in it. The prophet
   calls it his "standing upon his watch tower, and watching to see what
   God would speak unto him," Hab. ii 3, -- namely, in answer unto that
   prayer which he put up in his trouble. He is now waiting in expectation
   of an answer from God. And this is that which poor, weak, trembling
   sinners are so encouraged unto, Isa. xxxv. 3, 4, "Strengthen ye the
   weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a
   fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come."
   Weakness and discouragements are the effects of unbelief. These he
   would have removed, with an expectation of the coming of God unto the
   soul, according to the promise. And this, I say, belongs unto the
   waiting of the soul in the condition described. Such a one doth expect
   and hope that God will in his season manifest himself and his love unto
   him, and give him an experimental sense of a blessed interest in
   forgiveness. And the accomplishment of this purpose and promise of God,
   it looks out after continually. It will not despond and be heartless,
   but stir up and strengthen itself unto a full expectation to have the
   desires of his soul satisfied in due time: as we find David doing in
   places almost innumerable.

   This is the duty that, in the first place, is recommended unto the soul
   who is persuaded that there is forgiveness with God, but sees not his
   own interest therein -- Wait on, or for, the Lord. And it hath two
   properties when it is performed in a due manner, -- namely, patience
   and perseverance. By the one men are kept to the length of God's time;
   by the other they are preserved in a due length of their own duty.

   And this is that which was laid down in the first proposition drawn
   from the words, -- namely, that continuance in watching, until God
   appears unto the soul, is necessary, as that without which we cannot
   attain what we look after; and prevailing, as that wherein we shall
   never fail.

   God is not to be limited, nor his times prescribed unto him. We know
   our way and the end of our journey; but our stations of especial rest
   we must wait for at his mouth, as the people did in the wilderness.
   When David comes to deal with God in his great distress, he says unto
   him, "O Lord, thou art my God; my times are in thy hand," Ps. xxxi. 14,
   15. His times of trouble and of peace, of darkness and of light, he
   acknowledged to be in the hand and at the disposal of God, so that it
   was his duty to wait his time and season for his share and portion in
   them.

   During this state the soul meets with many oppositions, difficulties,
   and perplexities, especially if its darkness be of long continuance; as
   with some it abides many years, with some all the days of their lives.
   Their hope being hereby deferred makes their heart sick, and their
   spirit oftentimes to faint; and this fainting is a defect in waiting,
   for want of perseverance and continuance, which frustrates the end of
   it. So David, Ps. xxvii. 13, "I had fainted, unless I had believed to
   see the goodness of the Lord;" -- "Had I not received supportment by
   faith, I had fainted." And wherein doth that consist? what was the
   fainting which he had been overtaken withal, without the supportment
   mentioned? It was a relinquishment of waiting on God, as he manifests
   by the exhortation which he gives to himself and others, verse 14,
   "Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine
   heart: wait, I say, on the Lord;" -- "Wait with courage and resolution,
   that thou faint not." And the apostle puts the blessed event of faith
   and obedience upon the avoidance of this evil: Gal. vi. 9, "We shall
   reap, if we faint not." Hence we have both encouragements given against
   it, and promises that in the way of God we shall not be overtaken with
   it. "Consider the Lord Christ," saith the apostle, "the captain of your
   salvation, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds,'?" Heb. xii. 8.
   Nothing else can cause you to come short of the mark aimed at. "They,"
   saith the prophet, "that wait upon the Lord," -- that is, in the use of
   the means by him appointed, -- "shall not faint," Isa. xl. 31.

   This continuance, then, in waiting is to accompany this duty, upon the
   account of both the things mentioned in the proposition, -- that it is
   indispensably necessary on our own account, and it is assuredly
   prevailing in the end; it will not fail.

   1. It is necessary. They that watch for the morning, to whose frame and
   actings the waiting of the soul for God is compared, give not over
   until the light doth appear; or if they do, if they are wearied and
   faint, and so cease watching, all their former pains will be lost, and
   they will lie down in disappointments. So will it be with the soul that
   deserts its watch, and faints in its waking. If upon the eruption of
   new lusts or corruptions, -- if upon the return of old temptations, or
   the assaults of new ones, -- if upon a revived perplexing sense of
   guilt, or on the tediousness of working and labouring so much and so
   long in the dark, -- the soul begin to say in itself, "I have looked
   for light and behold darkness, for peace and yet trouble cometh; the
   summer is past, the harvest is ended, and I am not relieved; such and
   such blessed means have been enjoyed, and yet I have not attained
   rest;" and so give over its waiting in the way and course before
   prescribed; -- it will at length utterly fail, and come short of the
   grace aimed at. "Thou hast laboured, and hast not fainted," brings in
   the reward, Rev. ii. 3.

   2. Perseverance in waiting is assuredly prevalent; and this renders it
   a necessary part of the duty itself. If we continue to wait for the
   vision of peace it will come, it will not tarry, but answer our
   expectation of it. Never soul miscarried that abode in this duty unto
   the end. The joys of heaven may sometimes prevent consolations in this
   life; God sometimes gives in the full harvest without sending of the
   first-fruits aforehand; -- but spiritual or eternal peace and rest is
   the infallible end of permanent waiting for God.

   This is the duty that the psalmist declares himself to be engaged in,
   upon the encouraging discovery which was made unto him of forgiveness
   in God: "There is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. I
   wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope." And
   this is that which, in the like condition, is required of us This is
   the great direction which was given us, in the example and practice of
   the psalmist, as to our duty and deportment in the condition described.
   This was the way whereby he rose out of his depths and escaped out of
   his entanglements. Is this, then, the state of any of us? Let such take
   directions from hence.

   1. Encourage your souls unto waiting on God. Do new fears arise, do old
   disconsolations continue? Say unto your souls, "Yet wait on God. Why
   are you cast down, O our souls? and why are you disquieted within us?
   hope in God; for we shall yet praise him, who is the health of our
   countenance, and our God;'?" as the psalmist doth in the like case, Ps.
   xliii. 5. So he speaks elsewhere, "Wait on God, and be of good
   courage;" -- "Shake off sloth, rouse up yourselves from under
   despondencies; let not fears prevail." This is the only way for
   success, and it will assuredly be prevalent. Oppose this resolution to
   every discouragement, and it will give new life to faith and hope. Say,
   "My flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the rock of my heart, and my
   portion for ever;" as Ps. lxxiii. 26. Though thy perplexed thoughts
   have even wearied and worn out the outward man, as in many they do, so
   that flesh faileth, -- and though thou hast no refreshing evidence from
   within, from thyself, or thy own experience, so that thy heart faileth,
   -- yet resolve to look unto God; there is strength in him, and
   satisfaction in him, for the whole man; he is a rock, and a portion.
   This will strengthen things which otherwise will be ready to die. This
   will keep life in thy course, and stir thee up to plead it with God in
   an acceptable season, when he will be found. Job carried up his
   condition unto a supposition that God might slay him, -- that is, add
   one stroke, one rebuke unto another, until he was consumed, and so take
   him out of the world in darkness and in sorrow, -- yet he resolved to
   trust, to hope, to wait on him, as knowing that he should not utterly
   miscarry so doing. This frame the church expresseth so admirably that
   nothing can be added thereunto: Lam. iii. 17-26, "Thou hast removed my
   soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. And I said, My strength
   and my hope is perished from the Lord: remembering mine affliction and
   my misery, the wormwood and the gall. My soul hath them still in
   remembrance, and is humbled in me. This I recall to my mind, therefore
   have I hope. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed,
   because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is
   thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will
   I hope in him. The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the
   soul that seeketh him. It is good that a man should both hope and
   quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord." We have here both the
   condition and the duty insisted on, with the method of the soul's
   actings in reference unto the one and the other fully expressed. The
   condition is sad and bitter; the soul is in depths, far from peace and
   rest, verse 17. In this state it is ready utterly to faint, and to give
   up all for lost and gone, both strength for the present and hopes for
   the future, verse 18. This makes its condition full of sorrow and
   bitterness, and its own thoughts become unto it like "wormwood and
   gall," verses 19, 20. But doth he lie down under the burden of all this
   trouble? doth he despond and give over? No; saith he, "I call to mind
   that' there is forgiveness with God;' grace, mercy, goodness for the
   relief of distressed souls, such as are in my condition," verses 21-23.
   Thence the conclusion is, that as all help is to be looked for, all
   relief expected from him alone, so "it is good that a man should
   quietly wait and hope for the salvation of God," verses 24-26. This he
   stirs up himself unto as the best, as the most blessed course for his
   deliverance.

   2. Remember that diligent use of the means for the end aimed at is a
   necessary concomitant of, and ingredient unto, waiting on God. Take in
   the consideration of this direction also. Do not think to be freed from
   your entanglements by restless, heartless desiring that it were
   otherwise with you. Means are to be used that relief may be obtained.
   What those means are is known unto all. Mortification of sin, prayer,
   meditation, due attendance upon all gospel ordinances; conferring in
   general about spiritual things, advising in particular about our own
   state and condition, with such who, having received the tongue of the
   learned, are able to speak a word in season to them that are weary, --
   are required to this purpose. And in all these are diligence and
   perseverance to be exercised, or in vain shall men desire a delivery
   from their entanglements.
     __________________________________________________________________

   God the proper object of the soul's waiting in its distresses and
   depths.

   We have seen what the duty is intended in the proposition. We are
   nextly to consider the reason also of it, why this is the great, first,
   and principal duty of souls who in their depths have it discovered unto
   them that there is forgiveness with God; and the reason hereof is that
   which is expressed in our second observation before mentioned, namely,
   --

   That the proper object of a sin-distressed soul's waiting and
   expectation is God himself as revealed in Christ. "I have," saith the
   psalmist, "waited for Jehovah;" -- "It is not this or that mercy or
   grace, this or that help or relief, but it is Jehovah himself that I
   wait for."

   Here, then, we must do two things, -- first, Show in what sense God
   himself is the object of the waiting of the soul; secondly, How it
   appears from hence that waiting is so necessary a duty.

   First, It is the Lord himself, Jehovah himself, that the soul waiteth
   for. It is not grace, mercy, or relief absolutely considered, but the
   God of all grace and help, that is the full adequate object of the
   soul's waiting and expectation; only, herein he is not considered
   absolutely in his own nature, but as there is forgiveness with him.
   What is required hereunto hath been at large before declared. It is as
   he is revealed in and by Jesus Christ; as in him he hath found a
   ransom, and accepted the atonement for sinners in his blood; -- as he
   is a God in covenant, so he is himself the object of our waiting.

   And that, first, because all troubles, depths, entanglements arise
   from, -- 1. The absence of God from the soul; and, 2. From his
   displeasure.

   1. The absence of God from the soul, by his departure, withdrawing, or
   hiding himself from it, is that which principally casts the soul into
   its depths. "Woe unto them," saith the Lord, "when I depart from them!"
   Hos. ix. 12. And this woe, this sorrow, doth not attend only a
   universal, a total departure of God from any; but that also which is
   gradual or partial, in some things, in some seasons. When God withdraws
   his enlightening, his refreshing, his comforting presence, as to any
   ways or means whereby he hath formerly communicated himself unto the
   souls of any, then "woe unto them!" sorrows will befall them, and they
   will fall into depths and entanglements. Now, this condition calls for
   waiting. If God be withdrawn, if he hide himself, what hath the soul to
   do but to wait for his return? So saith the prophet Isaiah, chap. viii.
   17, "I will wait upon the Lord, that hideth his face from the house of
   Jacob, and I will look for him." If God hide himself, this is the
   natural and proper duty of the soul, to wait and to look for him. Other
   course of relief it cannot apply itself unto. What that waiting is, and
   wherein it doth consist, hath been declared. Patient seeking of God in
   the ways of his appointment is comprised in it. This the prophet
   expresseth in that word, "I will look for him;" indeed, the same in the
   original with that in the psalm, vqvyty lv?; -- "And I will earnestly
   look out after him, with expectation of his return unto me."

   2. A sense of God's displeasure is another cause of these depths and
   troubles, and of the continuance of the soul in them, notwithstanding
   it hath made a blessed discovery by faith that there is with him
   forgiveness. This hath been so fully manifested through the whole
   preceding discourse, that it need not again be insisted on. All hath
   respect unto sin; and the reason of the trouble that ariseth from sin
   is because of the displeasure of God against it. What, then, is the
   natural posture and frame of the soul towards God as displeased? Shall
   he contend with him? shall he harden himself against him? shall he
   despise his wrath and anger, and contemn his threatenings? or shall he
   hide himself from him, and so avoid the effects of his wrath? Who knows
   not how ruinous and pernicious to the soul such courses would be? and
   how many are ruined by them every day? Patient waiting is the soul's
   only reserve on this account also. And, --

   Secondly, This duty in the occasion mentioned is necessary upon the
   account of the greatness and sovereignty of him with whom we have to
   do: "My soul waiteth for Jehovah." Indeed, waiting is a duty that
   depends on the distance that is between the persons concerned in it, --
   namely, he that waiteth, and he that is waited on; so the psalmist
   informs us, Ps. cxxiii. 2. It is an action like that of servants and
   handmaids towards their masters or rulers. And the greater this
   distance is, the more cogent are the reasons of this duty on all
   occasions. And because we are practically averse from the due
   performance of this duty, or at least quickly grow weary of it,
   notwithstanding our full conviction of its necessity, I shall a little
   insist on some such considerations of God and ourselves, as may not
   only evince the necessity of this duty, but also satisfy us of its
   reasonableness; that by the first we may be engaged into it, and by the
   latter preserved in it.

   Two things we may to this purpose consider in God, in Jehovah, whom we
   are to wait for -- First, His being, and the absolute and essential
   properties of his nature; secondly, Those attributes of his nature
   which respect his dealing with us; -- both which are suited to beget in
   us affections and a frame of spirit compliant with the duty proposed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Considerations of God, rendering our waiting on him reasonable and
   necessary -- His glorious being.

   First, Let us consider the infinite glorious being of Jehovah, with his
   absolute, incommunicable, essential excellencies; and then try whether
   it doth not become us in every condition to wait for him, and
   especially in that under consideration. This course God himself took
   with Job to recover him from his discontents and complaints, to reduce
   him to quietness and waiting. He sets before him his own glorious
   greatness, as manifested in the works of his power, that thereby, being
   convinced of his own ignorance, weakness, and infinite distance in all
   things from him, he might humble his soul into the most submissive
   dependence on him and waiting for him. And this he doth accordingly,
   chap. xlii. 6: "I abhor myself," saith he, "and repent in dust and
   ashes." His soul now comes to be willing to be at God's disposal; and
   therein he found present rest and a speedy healing of his condition. It
   is "the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is
   Holy," Isa. lvii. 15, with whom we have now to do: "He sitteth upon the
   circle of the earth, and the inhabitants of it are as grasshoppers
   before him; yea, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
   as the small dust of the balance; he taketh up the isles as a very
   little thing. All nations before him are as nothing; and they are
   counted unto him less than nothing, and vanity," Isa. xl. 15, 17, 22.
   To what end doth the Lord set forth and declare his glorious greatness
   and power? It is that all might be brought to trust in him and to wait
   for him, as at large is declared in the close of the chapter; for shall
   "grasshoppers," a "drop of the bucket," "dust of the balance," things
   "less than nothing," repine against, or wax weary of, the will of the
   immense, glorious, and lofty One? He that "taketh up the isles as a
   very little thing," may surely, if he please, destroy, cast, and
   forsake one isle, one city in an isle, one person in a city; and we are
   before him but single persons. Serious thoughts of this infinite,
   all-glorious Being will either quiet our souls or overwhelm them. All
   our weariness of his dispensations towards us arises from secret
   imaginations that he is such a one as ourselves, -- one that is to do
   nothing but what seems good in our eyes. But if we cannot comprehend
   his being, we cannot make rules to judge of his ways and proceedings.
   And how small a portion is it that we know of God! The nearest
   approaches of our reasons and imaginations leave us still at an
   infinite distance from him. And, indeed, what we speak of his
   greatness, we know not well what it signifies; we only declare our
   respect unto that which we believe, admire, and adore, but are not able
   to comprehend. All our thoughts come as short of his excellent
   greatness as our natures do of his, -- that is, infinitely. Behold the
   universe, the glorious fabric of heaven and earth; how little is it
   that we know of its beauty, order, and disposal! -- yet was it all the
   product of the word of his mouth; and with the same facility can he,
   when he pleaseth, reduce it to its primitive nothing. And what are we,
   poor worms of the earth, an inconsiderable, unknown part of the lower
   series and order of the works of his hands, few in number, fading in
   condition, unregarded unto the residue of our fellow-creatures, that we
   should subduct ourselves from under any kind of his dealings with us,
   or he weary of waiting for his pleasure? This he presseth on us, Ps.
   xlvi. 10, "Be still, and know that I am God;" -- "Let there be no more
   repinings, no more disputings; continue waiting in silence and
   patience. Consider who I am. Be still, and know that I am God.'?"

   Farther to help us in this consideration, let us a little also fix our
   minds towards some of the glorious, essential, incommunicable
   properties of his nature distinctly; as, --

   1. His eternity. This Moses proposeth, to bring the souls of believers
   to submission, trust, and waiting: Ps. xc. 1," From everlasting to
   everlasting thou art God;" -- "One that hath his being and subsistence
   not in a duration of time, but in eternity itself." So doth Habakkuk
   also, chap. i. 12, "Art thou not from everlasting, O Lord my God, mine
   Holy One?" and hence he draws his conclusion against making haste in
   any condition, and for tarrying and waiting for God. The like
   consideration is managed by David also, Ps. cii. 27. How inconceivable
   is this glorious divine property unto the thoughts and minds of men!
   How weak are the ways and terms whereby they go about to express it!
   One says, it is a "nunc stans;" another, that it is a "perpetual
   duration." He that says most, only signifies what he knows of what it
   is not. We are of yesterday, change every moment, and are leaving our
   station to-morrow. God is still the same, was so before the world was,
   -- from eternity. And now I cannot think what I have said, but only
   have intimated what I adore. The whole duration of the world, from the
   beginning unto the end, takes up no space in this eternity of God: for
   how long soever it hath continued or may yet continue, it will all
   amount but to so many thousand years, so long a time; and time hath no
   place in eternity. And for us who have in this matter to do with God,
   what is our continuance unto that of the world? a moment, as it were,
   in comparison of the whole. When men's lives were of old prolonged
   beyond the date and continuance of empires or kingdoms now, yet this
   was the winding up of all, -- such a one lived so many years, "and he
   died," Gen. v. And what are we, poor worms, whose lives are measured by
   incises, in comparison of their span? what are we before the eternal
   God, God always immutably subsisting in his own infinite being? A real
   consideration hereof will subdue the soul into a condition of
   dependence on him and of waiting for him.

   2. The immensity of his essence and his omnipresence is of the same
   consideration: "Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord," Jer.
   xxiii. 24. "The heavens, even the heaven of heavens," the supreme and
   most comprehensive created being, "cannot contain him," saith Solomon.
   In his infinitely glorious being he is present with, and indistant from
   all places, things, times, all the works of his hands; and is no less
   gloriously subsisting where they are not. God is where heaven and earth
   are not, no less than where they are; and where they are not is
   himself. Where there is no place, no space, real or imaginary, God is;
   for place and imagination have nothing to do with immensity. And he is
   present everywhere in creation, -- where I am writing, where you are
   reading; he is present with you, indistant from you. The thoughts of
   men's hearts for the most part are, that God as to his essence is in
   heaven only; and it is well if some think he is there, seeing they live
   and act as if there were neither God nor devil but themselves. But on
   these apprehensions such thoughts are ready secretly to arise, and
   effectually to prevail, as are expressed Job xxii. 13, 14, "How doth
   God know? can he judge through the dark? Thick clouds are a covering
   unto him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven."
   Apprehensions of God's distance from men harden them in their ways. But
   it is utterly otherwise. God is everywhere, and a man may on all
   occasions say with Jacob, "God is in this place, and I knew it not."
   Let the soul, then, who is thus called to wait on God, exercise itself
   with thoughts about this immensity of his nature and being. Comprehend
   it, fully understand it, we can never; but the consideration of it will
   give that awe of his greatness upon our hearts, as that we shall learn
   to tremble before him, and to be willing to wait for him in all things.

   3. Thoughts of the holiness of God, or infinite self-purity of this
   eternal, immense Being, are singularly useful to the same purpose. This
   is that which Eliphaz affirms that he received by vision to reply to
   the complaint and impatience of Job, chap. iv. 17-21. After he hath
   declared his vision, with the manner of it, this he affirms to be the
   revelation that by voice was made unto him: "Shall mortal man be more
   just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker? Behold, he put
   no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly. How
   much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in
   the dust, who are crushed before the moth?" If the saints and angels in
   heaven do not answer this infinite holiness of God in their most
   perfect condition, is it meet for worms of the earth to suppose that
   any thing which proceeds from him is not absolutely holy and perfect,
   and so best for them? This is the fiery property of the nature of God,
   whence he is called a "consuming fire" and "everlasting burnings." And
   the law, whereon he had impressed some representation of it, is called
   a "fiery law," as that which will consume and burn up whatever is
   perverse and evil. Hence the prophet who had a representation of the
   glory of God in a vision, and heard the seraphim proclaiming his
   holiness, cried out, "Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
   unclean lips," Isa. vi. 5. He thought it impossible that he should bear
   that near approach of the holiness of God. And with the remembrance
   hereof doth Joshua still the people, -- with the terror of the Lord,
   chap. xxiv. 19. Let such souls, then, as are under troubles and
   perplexities on any account, endeavour to exercise their thoughts about
   this infinite purity and fiery holiness of God. They will quickly find
   it their wisdom to become as weaned children before him, and content
   themselves with what he shall guide them unto; which is to wait for
   him. This flew holiness streams from his throne, Dan. vii. 10, and
   would quickly consume the whole creation, as now under the curse and
   sin, were it not for the interposing of Jesus Christ

   4. His glorious majesty as the Ruler of all the world. Majesty relates
   unto government, and it calls us to such an awe of him as doth render
   our waiting for him comely and necessary. God's throne is said to be in
   heaven, and there principally do the glorious beams of his terrible
   majesty shine forth; but he hath also made some representation of it on
   the earth, that we might learn to fear before him. Such was the
   appearance that he gave of his glory in the giving of the law, whereby
   he will judge the world, and condemn the transgressors of it who obtain
   not an acquitment in the blood of Jesus Christ. See the description of
   it in Exod. xix. 16-18. "So terrible was the sight" hereof, "that
   Moses" himself "said, I exceedingly fear and quake," Heb. xii. 21. And
   what effect it had upon all the people is declared, Exod. xx. 18, 19.
   They were not able to bear it, although they had good assurance that it
   was for their benefit and advantage that he so drew nigh and manifested
   his glory unto them. Are we not satisfied with our condition? cannot we
   wait under his present dispensations? Let us think how we may approach
   unto his presence, or stand before his glorious majesty. Will not the
   dread of his excellency fall upon us? will not his terror make us
   afraid? shall we not think his way best, and his time best, and that
   our duty is to be silent before him? And the like manifestation hath he
   made of his glory, as the great Judge of all upon the throne, unto
   sundry of the prophets: as unto Isaiah, chap. vi. 1-4; to Ezekiel,
   chap. i.; to Daniel, chap. vii. 9, 10; to John, Rev. i. Read the places
   attentively, and learn to tremble before him. These are not things that
   are foreign unto us. This God is our God. The same throne of his
   greatness and majesty is still established in the heavens. Let us,
   then, in all our hastes and heats that our spirits in any condition are
   prone unto, present ourselves before this throne of God, and then
   consider what will be best for us to say or do; what frame of heart and
   spirit will become us, and be safest for us. All this glory doth
   encompass us every moment, although we perceive it not. And it will be
   but a few days before all the vails and shades that are about us shall
   be taken away and depart; and then shall all this glory appear unto us
   unto endless bliss or everlasting woe. Let us therefore know, that
   nothing, in our dealings with him, doth better become us than silently
   to wait for him, and what he will speak unto us in our depths and
   straits.

   5. It is good to consider the instances that God hath given of this his
   infinite greatness, power, majesty, and glory. Such was his mighty work
   of creating all things out of nothing. We dwell on little mole-hills in
   the earth, and yet we know the least part of the excellency of that
   spot of ground which is given us for our habitation here below. But
   what is it unto the whole habitable world and the fulness thereof? And
   what an amazing thing is its greatness, with the wide and large sea,
   with all sorts of creatures therein! The least of these hath a beauty,
   a glory, an excellency, that the utmost of our inquiries end in
   admiration of. And all this is but the earth, the lower, depressed part
   of the world. What shall we say concerning the heavens over us, and all
   those creatures of light that have their habitations in them? Who can
   conceive the beauty, order, use, and course of them? The consideration
   hereof caused the psalmist to cry out, "Lord, our Lord, how excellent
   and glorious art thou!" Ps. viii. 1. And what is the rise, spring, and
   cause of these things? are they not all the effect of the word of the
   power of this glorious God? And doth he not in them, and by them, speak
   us into a reverence of his greatness? The like, also, may be said
   concerning his mighty and strange works of providence in the rule of
   the world. Is not this he who brought the flood of old upon the world
   of ungodly men? Is it not he who consumed Sodom and Gomorrah with fire
   from heaven, setting them forth as examples unto them that should
   afterward live ungodly, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire? Is it
   not he who destroyed Egypt with his plagues, and drowned Pharaoh with
   his host in the Red Sea? Is it not he, one of whose servants slew a
   hundred and fourscore and five thousand in Sennacherib's army in one
   night? that opened the earth to swallow up Dathan and Abiram? and sent
   out fire from the altar to devour Nadab and Abihu? And have not all
   ages been filled with such instances of his greatness and power?

   The end why I have insisted on these things is, to show the
   reasonableness of the duty which we are pressing unto, -- namely, to
   wait on God quietly and patiently in every condition of distress; for
   what else becomes us when we have to do with this great and holy One?
   And a due consideration of these things will exceedingly influence our
   minds thereunto.

   Secondly, This waiting for God respecteth the whole of the condition
   expressed in the psalm; and this containeth not only spiritual depths
   about sin, which we have at large insisted on, but also providential
   depths, depths of trouble or affliction, that we may be exercised
   withal in the holy, wise providence of God. In reference also unto
   these, waiting in patience and silence is our duty. And there are two
   considerations that will assist us in this duty, with respect unto such
   depths, -- that is, of trouble or affliction. And the first of these is
   the consideration of those properties of God which he exerciseth in an
   especial manner in all his dealings with us, and which in all our
   troubles we are principally to regard. The second is the consideration
   of ourselves, what we are, and what we have deserved.

   Let us begin with the former. And there are four things in God's
   dispensations towards us and dealing with us that in this matter we
   should consider, all suited to work in us the end aimed at:--

   1. The first is his sovereignty. This he declares, this we are to
   acknowledge and submit unto, in all the great and dreadful
   dispensations of his providence, in all his dealings with our souls.
   May he not do what he will with his own? Who shall say unto him, What
   doest thou? or if they do so, what shall give them countenance in their
   so doing? He made all this world of nothing, and could have made
   another, more, or all things, quite otherwise than they are. It would
   not subsist one moment without his omnipotent supportment. Nothing
   would be continued in its place, course, use, without his effectual
   influence and countenance. If any thing can be, live, or act a moment
   without him, we may take free leave to dispute its disposal with him,
   and to haste unto the accomplishment of our desires. But from the
   angels in heaven to the worms of the earth and the grass of the field,
   all depend on him and his power continually. Why was this part of the
   creation an angel, that a worm; this a man, that a brute beast? Is it
   from their own choice, designing, or contrivance, or brought about by
   their own wisdom? or is it merely from the sovereign pleasure and will
   of God? And what a madness is it to repine against what he doth, seeing
   all things are as he makes them and disposeth them, nor can be
   otherwise! Even the repiner himself hath his being and subsistence upon
   his mere pleasure. This sovereignty of God Elihu pleads in his dealings
   with Job, chap. xxxiii. 8-13. He apprehended that Job had reasoned
   against God's severe dispensations towards him, and that he did not
   humble himself under his mighty hand wherewith he was exercised, nor
   wait for him in a due manner; and, therefore, what doth he propose unto
   him to bring him unto this duty? what doth he reply unto his reasonings
   and complaints? "Behold," says he, verse 12, "in this thou art not
   just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man." Verse 13, "Why
   dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his
   matters;" -- "Be it that in other things thou art just and innocent,
   that thou art free from the things wherewith thy friends have charged
   thee, yet in this matter thou art not just; it is neither just nor
   equal that any man should complain of or repine against any of God's
   dispensations." "Yea, but I suppose that these dealings of God are very
   grievous, very dreadful, such as he hath, it may be, scarce exercised
   towards any from the foundation of the world; to be utterly destroyed
   and consumed in a day, in all relations arid enjoyments, and that at a
   time and season when no such tiling was looked for or provided against;
   to have a sense of sin revived on the conscience, after pardon
   obtained, as it is with me." "All is one," saith he; "if thou
   complainest thou art not just." And what reason doth he give thereof?
   Why," God is greater than man;' infinitely so in power and sovereign
   glory. He is so absolutely therein that he giveth not account of any of
   his matters;' and what folly, what injustice is it, to complain of his
   proceedings! Consider his absolute dominion over the works of his
   hands, over thyself, and all that thou hast; his infinite distance from
   thee, and greatness above thee; and then see whether it be just or no
   to repine against what he doth." And he pursues the same consideration,
   chap. xxxiv. 18, 19: "If when kings and princes rule in righteousness,
   it is a contempt of their authority to say unto them they are wicked
   and ungodly, then wilt thou speak against him, contend with him, that
   accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than
   the poor? for they are all the work of his hands.'?" And, verse 29,
   "When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he
   hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a
   nation, or against a man only." All is one; whatever God doth, and
   towards whomsoever, be they many or few, a whole nation, or city, or
   one single person, be they high or low, rich or poor, good or bad, all
   are the works of his hands, and he may deal with them as seems good
   unto him. And this man alone, as God afterward declares, made use of
   the right and proper mediums to take off Job from complaining, and to
   compose his spirit to rest and peace, and to bring him to wait
   patiently for God. For whereas his other friends injuriously charged
   him with hypocrisy, and that he had in an especial manner, above other
   men, deserved those judgments of God which he was exercised withal; he,
   who was conscious unto his own integrity, was only provoked and
   exasperated by their arguings, and stirred up to plead his own
   innocency and uprightness. But this man, allowing him the plea of his
   integrity, calls him to the consideration of the greatness and
   sovereignty of God, against which there is no rising up; and this God
   himself afterward calls him unto.

   Deep and serious thoughts of God's sovereignty and absolute dominion or
   authority over all the works of his hands, are an effectual means to
   work the soul unto this duty; yea, this is that which we are to bring
   our souls to. Let us consider with whom we have to do. Are not we and
   all our concernments in his hands, as the clay in the hand of the
   potter? and may he not do what he will with his own? Shall we call him
   unto an account? is not what he doth good and holy because he doth it?
   Do any repining thoughts against the works of God arise in our hearts?
   are any complaints ready to break out of our mouths? let us lay our
   hands on our hearts, and our mouths in the dust, with thoughts of his
   greatness and absolute sovereignty, and it will work our whole souls
   into a better frame.

   And this extends itself unto the manners, times, and seasons of all
   things whatever. As in earthly things, if God will bring a dreadful
   judgment of fire upon a people, a nation; ah! why must it be London? if
   on London, why so terrible, raging, and unconquerable? why the city,
   not the suburbs? why my house, not my neighbour's? why had such a one
   help, and I none? All these things are wholly to be referred to God's
   sovereign pleasure. There alone can the soul of man find rest and
   peace. It is so in spiritual dispensations also.

   Thus Aaron, upon the sudden death of his two eldest sons, being minded
   by Moses of God's sovereignty and holiness, immediately "held his
   peace," or quietly humbled himself under his mighty hand, Lev. x. 3.
   And David, when things were brought into extreme confusion by the
   rebellion of Absalom, followed by the ungodly multitude of the whole
   nation, relinquisheth all other arguments and pleas, and lets go
   complaints in a resignation of himself and all his concernments unto
   the absolute pleasure of God, 2 Sam. xv. 25, 26. And this, in all our
   extremities, must we bring our souls unto before we can attain any rest
   or peace, or the least comfortable persuasion that we may not yet fall
   under greater severities, in the just indignation of God against us.

   2. The wisdom of God is also to be considered and submitted unto: Job
   ix. 4, "He is wise in heart: who hath hardened himself against him, and
   hath prospered?" This the prophet joins with his greatness and
   sovereignty, Isa. xl. 12-14. "There is no searching of his
   understanding," verse 28. And the apostle winds up all his
   considerations of the works of God in a holy admiration of his
   knowledge and wisdom, whence his "judgment becomes unsearchable, and
   his ways past finding out," Rom. xi. 33, 34. He seeth and knoweth all
   things, in all their causes, effects, consequences, and circumstances,
   in their utmost reach and tendency, in their correspondencies one unto
   another, and suitableness unto his own glory; and so alone judgeth
   aright of all things. The wisest of men, as David speaks, walk in a
   shade We see little, we know little; and that but of a very few things,
   and in an imperfect manner; and that of their present appearances,
   abstracted from their issues, successes, ends, and relations unto other
   things. And if we would be farther wise in the works of God, we shall
   be found to be like the wild ass's colt. What is good for us or the
   church of God, what is evil to it or us, we know not at all; but all
   things are open and naked unto God. The day will come, indeed, wherein
   we shall have such a prospect of the works of God, see one thing so set
   against another, as to find goodness, beauty, and order in them all, --
   that they were all done in number, weight, and measure, -- that nothing
   could have been otherwise without an abridgment of his glory and
   disadvantage of them that believe in him; but for the present, all our
   wisdom consists in referring all unto him. He who doth these things is
   infinitely wise; he knows what he doth, and why, and what will be the
   end of all. We are apt, it may be, to think that at such seasons all
   things will go to wreck with ourselves, with the church, or with the
   whole world: "How can this breach be repaired, this loss made up, this
   ruin recovered? peace is gone, trade is gone, our substance is gone,
   the church is gone, -- all is gone; confusion and utter desolation lie
   at the door." But if a man who is unskilled and unexperienced should be
   at sea, it may be, every time the vessel wherein he is seems to decline
   on either side, he would be apt to conceive they should be all cast
   away; but yet, if he be not childishly timorous, when the master shall
   tell him that there is no danger, bid him trust to his skill and it
   shall be well with him, it will yield quietness and satisfaction. We
   are indeed in a storm, -- the whole earth seems to reel and stagger
   like a drunken man; but yet our souls may rest in the infinite skill
   and wisdom of the great Pilot of the whole creation, who steers all
   things according to the counsel of his will. "His works are manifold:
   in wisdom hath he made them all," Ps. civ. 24. And in the same wisdom
   doth he dispose of them: "All these things come forth from the Lord of
   hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working," Isa.
   xxviii. 29. What is good, meet, useful for us, for ours, for the
   churches, for the city, for the land of our nativity, he knows, and of
   creatures not one. This infinite wisdom of God, also, are we therefore
   to resign and submit ourselves unto. His hand in all his works is
   guided by infinite wisdom. In thoughts thereof, in humbling ourselves
   thereunto, shall we find rest and peace; and this in all our pressures
   will work us to a waiting for him.

   3. The righteousness of God is also to be considered in this matter.
   That name in the Scripture is used to denote many excellencies of God,
   all which are reducible unto the infinite rectitude of his nature. I
   intend that at present which is called "justitia regiminis," his
   righteousness in rule or government. This is remembered by Abraham:
   Gen. xviii. 25, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" And by
   the apostle: "Is God unjust who taketh vengeance? God forbid." This our
   souls are to own in all the works of God. They are all righteous, --
   all his who "will do no iniquity, whose throne is established in
   judgment." However they may be dreadful, grievous, and seem severe, yet
   they are all righteous. It is true he will sometimes "rise up and do
   strange works, strange acts," Isa. xxviii. 21, such as he will not do
   often nor ordinarily, such as shall fill the world with dread and
   amazement, -- he will "answer his people in terrible things!" but yet
   all shall be in righteousness. And to complain of that which is
   righteous, to repine against it, is the highest unrighteousness that
   may be. Faith, then, fixing the soul on the righteousness of God, is an
   effectual means to humble it under his mighty hand. And to help us
   herein, we may consider, --

   (1.) That "God judgeth not as man judgeth." We judge by the "seeing of
   the eye, and hearing of the ear," -- according to outward appearances
   and evidences; "but God searcheth the heart." We judge upon what is
   between man and man; God principally upon what is between himself and
   man. And what do we know or understand of these things? or what there
   is in the heart of man, what purposes, what contrivances, what designs,
   what corrupt affections, what sins; what transactions have been between
   God and them; what warnings he hath given them; what reproofs, what
   engagements they have made; what convictions they have had; what use
   they were putting their lives, their substance, their families unto?
   Alas! we know nothing of these things, and so are able to make no
   judgment of the proceedings of God upon them; but this we know, that he
   "is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works," yea, the
   most terrible of them. And when the secrets of all hearts shall be
   revealed, ah! how glorious will be his drowning of the old world,
   firing of Sodom, swallowing up of Dathan and Abiram in the earth, the
   utter rejection of the Jews, with all other acts of his providence
   seeming to be accompanied with severity! And so will our own trials,
   inward or outward, appear to be.

   (2.) God is judge of all the world, of all ages, times, places,
   persons; and disposeth of all so as they may tend unto the good of the
   whole and his own glory in the universe. Our thoughts are bounded, much
   more our observations and abilities, to measure things within a very
   small compass. Every thing stands alone unto us, whereby we see little
   of its beauty or order, nor do know how it ought justly to be disposed
   of. That particular may seem deformed unto us, which, when it is under
   His eye who sees all at once, past, present, and to come, with all
   those joints and bands of wisdom and order whereby things are related
   unto one another, is beautiful and glorious: for as nothing is of
   itself, nor by itself, nor to itself, so nothing stands alone; but
   there is a line of mutual respect that runs through the creation and
   every particular of it, and that in all its changes and alterations
   from the beginning to the end, which gives it its loveliness, life, and
   order. He that can at once see but one part of a goodly statue or
   colossus might think it a very deformed piece, when he that views it
   altogether is assured of its due proportion, symmetry, and loveliness.
   Now, all things, ages, and persons, all thus at once are objected unto
   the sight of God; and he disposeth them with respect unto the whole,
   that every one may fill up its own place, and sustain its part and
   share in the common tendency of all to the same end.

   And hence it is that in public judgments and calamities, God oftentimes
   suffers the godly to be involved with the wicked, and that not on the
   account of their own persons, but as they are parts of that body which
   he will destroy. This Job expresseth somewhat harshly, but there is
   truth in his assertion: chap. ix. 22, 23, "This is one thing, therefore
   I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. If the scourge
   slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent." God in
   public desolations oftentimes takes good and bad together; a sudden
   scourge involves them all. And this God doth for sundry reasons; as, --

   [1.] That he may manifest his own holiness; which is such that he can,
   without the least injustice or oppression, even upon the account of
   their own provocations, take away the houses, possessions, estates,
   liberties, and lives of the best of his own saints: for how should a
   man, any man, the best of men, be just with God, if he would contend
   with him? No man can answer to him "one of a thousand," Job ix. 3:--
   This they will also own and acknowledge; upon the account of
   righteousness none can open his mouth about his judgments, without the
   highest impiety and wickedness.

   [2.] He doth so that his own people may learn to know his terror, and
   to rejoice always before him with trembling. Therefore Job affirms,
   that "in the time of his prosperity he was not secure," but still
   trembled in himself with thoughts of the judgments of God. Doubtless
   much wretched carnal security would be ready to invade and possess the
   hearts of believers, if God should always and constantly pass them by
   in the dispensations of his public judgments.

   [3.] That it may be a stone of offence and a stumbling-block unto
   wicked men, who are to be hardened in their sins and prepared for ruin.
   When they see that all things fall alike unto all, and that those who
   have made the strictest profession of the name and fear of God fare no
   better than themselves, they are encouraged to despise the warnings of
   God and the strokes of his hand, and so to rush on unto the destruction
   whereunto they are prepared.

   [4.] God doth it to proclaim unto all the world that what he doth here
   is no final judgment and ultimate determination concerning things and
   persons; for who can see the "wise man dying as a fool," the righteous
   and holy perishing in their outward concernments as the ungodly and
   wicked, but must conclude that the righteous God, the judge of all,
   hath appointed another day, wherein all things must be called over
   again, and every one then receive his final reward, according as his
   works shall appear to have been? And thus are we to humble ourselves
   unto the righteousness wherewith the hand of God is always accompanied.

   [5.] His goodness and grace is also to be considered in all the works
   of his mighty hands. As there is no unrighteousness in him, so also
   [there is] all that is good and gracious. And whatever there is in any
   trouble of allay from the utmost wrath, is of mere goodness and grace.
   Thy houses are burned, but perhaps thy goods are saved, -- is there no
   grace, no goodness therein? Or perhaps thy substance also is consumed,
   but yet thy person is alive; and should a living man complain? But say
   what thou wilt, this stroke is not hell, which thou hast deserved long
   ago, yea, it may be a means of preventing thy going thither; so that it
   is accompanied with infinite goodness, patience, and mercy also. And if
   the considerations hereof will not quiet thy heart, take heed lest a
   worse thing befall thee.

   And these things amongst others are we to consider in God, to lead our
   hearts into an acquiescing in his will, a submission under his mighty
   hand, and a patient waiting for the issue.

   Secondly, [As to ourselves, what we are, and what we have deserved] --

   1. Consider our mean and abject condition, and that infinite distance
   wherein we stand from him with whom we have to do. When Abraham, the
   father of the faithful and friend of God, came to treat with him about
   his judgments, he doth it with this acknowledgment of his condition,
   that he was "mere dust and ashes," Gen. xviii. 27, -- a poor abject
   creature, that God at his pleasure had formed out of the dust of the
   earth, and which in a few days was to be reduced again into the ashes
   of it. We can forget nothing more perniciously than what we are. "Man
   is a worm," saith Bildad, "and the son of man is but a worm," Job xxv.
   6. "And therefore," says Job himself, "I have said to corruption, Thou
   art my father: and to the worm, Thou art my mother and my sister,'?"
   chap. xvii. 14. His affinity, his relation unto them, is the nearest
   imaginable, and he is no otherwise to be accounted of; and there is
   nothing that God abhors more than an elation of mind in the
   forgetfulness of our mean, frail condition. "Thou sayest," said he to
   the proud prince of Tyrus, "that thou art a god; but," saith he, "wilt
   thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God.?" Ezek. xxviii. 2,
   9. That severe conviction did God provide for his pride, "Thou shalt be
   a man, and no god, in the hand of him that slayeth thee." And when
   Herod prided himself in the acclamations of the vain multitude, ("The
   voice of a god, and not of a man!") the angel of the Lord filled that
   god immediately with worms, which slew him and devoured him, Acts xii.
   23. There is, indeed, nothing more effectual to abase the pride of the
   thoughts of men than a due remembrance that they are so. Hence the
   psalmist prays, Ps. ix. 20, "Put them in fear, O Lord; that the nations
   may know themselves to be but men;" so, and no more: 'nvs hmh?, "poor,
   miserable, frail, mortal man," as the word signifies. "What is man?
   what is his life? what is his strength?" said one; "The dream of a
   shadow; a mere nothing." Or as David, much better, "Every man living,
   in his best condition, is altogether vanity," Ps. xxxix. 5. And James,
   "Our life," which is our best, our all, "is but a vapour, that
   appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away," chap. iv. 14.
   But enough hath been spoken by many on this subject. And we that have
   seen so many thousands each week, in one city, carried away to the
   grave, have been taught the truth of our frailty, even as with thorns
   and briers. But I know not how it comes to pass, there is not any thing
   we are more apt to forget than what we ourselves are; and this puts men
   on innumerable miscarriages towards God and one another. Thou,
   therefore, that art exercised under the hand of God in any severe
   dispensation, and art ready on all occasions to fill thy mouth with
   complaints, sit down a little and take a right measure of thyself, and
   see whether this frame and posture becomes thee. It is the great God
   against whom thou repinest, and thou art a man, and that is a name of a
   worm, a poor, frail, dying worm; and it may be whilst thou art
   speaking, thou art no more. And wilt thou think it meet for such a one
   as thou art to magnify thyself against the great possessor of heaven
   and earth? Poor clay, poor dust and ashes, poor dying worm! know thy
   state and condition, and fall down quietly under the mighty hand of
   God. Though thou wranglest with men about thy concernments, let God
   alone. "The potsherds may contend with the potsherds of the earth, but
   woe unto him that striveth with his Maker!"

   2. Consider that in this frail condition we have all greatly sinned
   against God. So did Job, chap. vii. 20, "I have sinned; what shall I do
   unto thee, O thou Preserver of men?" If this consideration will not
   satisfy thy mind, yet it will assuredly stop the mouths of all the sons
   of men. Though all the curses of the law should be executed upon us,
   yet "every mouth must be stopped;" because "all the world is become
   guilty before God," Rom. iii. 19. "Wherefore doth a living man
   complain?" saith the prophet, Lam. iii. 39. Why, it may be, it is
   because that his trouble is great and inexpressible, and such as seldom
   or never befell any before him. But what then? Saith he, "Shall a man
   complain for the punishment of his sins?" If this living man be a
   sinful man, as there is none that liveth and sinneth not, whatever his
   state and condition be, he hath no ground of murmuring or complaint.
   For a sinful man to complain, especially whilst he is yet a living man,
   is most unreasonable; for, --

   (1.) Whatever hath befallen us, it is just on the account that we are
   sinners before God; and to repine against the judgments of God, that
   are rendered evidently righteous upon the account of sin, is to
   anticipate the condition of the damned in hell, a great part of whose
   misery it is that they always repine against that sentence and
   punishment which they know to be most righteous and holy. If this were
   now a place, if that were now my design, to treat of the sins of all
   professors, how easy were it to stop the mouths of all men about their
   troubles! But that is not my present business. I speak unto particular
   persons, and that not with an especial design to convince them of their
   sins, but to humble their souls. Another season may be taken to press
   that consideration, directly and professedly also. At present let us
   only, when our souls are ready to be entangled with the thoughts of any
   severe dispensation of God, and our own particular pressures, troubles,
   miseries, occasioned thereby, turn into ourselves, and take a view
   every one of his own personal provocations; and when we have done so,
   see what we have to say to God, what we have to complain of. Let the
   man hold his tongue, and let the sinner speak. Is not God holy,
   righteous, wise, in what he hath done? and if he be, why do we not
   subscribe unto his ways, and submit quietly unto his will?

   (2.) But this is not all We are not only such sinners as to render
   these dispensations of God evidently holy, these judgments of his
   righteous; but also to manifest that they are accompanied with
   unspeakable patience, mercy, and grace. To instance in one
   particular:-- Is it the burning of our houses, the spoiling of our
   goods, the ruin of our estates alone, that our sins have deserved? If
   God had made the temporary fire on earth to have been unto us a way of
   entrance into the eternal fire of hell, we had not had whereof
   righteously to complain. May we not, then, see a mixture of unspeakable
   patience, grace, and mercy, in every dispensation? and shall we, then,
   repine against it? Is it not better advice, "Go, and sin no more, lest
   a worse thing befall thee?" For a sinner out of hell not to rest in the
   will of God, not to humble himself under his mighty hand, is to make
   himself guilty of the especial sin of hell. Other sins deserve it, but
   repining against God is principally, yea, only committed in it. The
   church comes to a blessed quieting resolution in this case, Micah vii.
   9, "I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned
   against him;" bear it quietly, patiently, and submit under his hand
   therein.

   3. Consider that of ourselves we are not able to make a right judgment
   of what is good for us, what evil unto us, or what tends most directly
   unto our chiefest end. Ps. xxxix. 6, "Surely mall walketh in a vain
   shew," -- vtslm?, in an image full of false representations of things,
   in the midst of vain appearances, so that he knows not what to choose
   or do aright; and therefore spends the most of his time and strength
   about things that are of no use or purpose unto him: "Surely they are
   disquieted in vain." And hereof he gives one especial instance: "He
   heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather;" which is but one
   example of the manifold frustrations that men meet withal in the whole
   course of their lives, as not knowing what is good for them. We all
   profess to aim at one chief and principal end, -- namely, the enjoyment
   of God in Christ as our eternal reward; and in order thereunto, to be
   carried on in the use of the means of faith and obedience, tending to
   that end. Now, if this be so, the suitableness or unsuitableness of all
   other things, being good or evil unto us, is to be measured by their
   tendency unto this end. And what know we hereof? As unto the things of
   this life, do we know whether it will be best for us to be rich or
   poor, to have houses or to be harbourless, to abound or to want, to
   leave wealth and inheritances unto our children, or to leave them naked
   unto the providence of God? Do we know what state, what condition will
   most further our obedience, best obviate our temptations, or call most
   on us to mortify our corruptions? And if we know nothing at all of
   these things, as indeed we do not, were it not best for us to leave
   them quietly unto God's disposal? I doubt not but it will appear at the
   last day that a world of evil in the hearts of men was stifled by the
   destruction of their outward concernments, more by their inward
   troubles; that many were delivered from temptations by it, who
   otherwise would have been overtaken, to their ruin, and the scandal of
   the gospel; that many a secret imposthume hath been lanced and cured by
   a stroke: for God doth not send judgments on his own for judgments'
   sake, for punishment's sake, but always to accomplish some blessed
   design of grace towards them. And there is no one soul in particular
   which shall rightly search itself, and consider its state and
   condition, but will be able to see wisdom, grace, and care towards
   itself in all the dispensations of God. And if I would here enter upon
   the benefits that, through the sanctifying hand of God, do redound unto
   believers by afflictions, calamities, troubles, distresses,
   temptations, and the like effects of God's visitations, it would be of
   use unto the souls of men in this case. But this subject hath been so
   often and so well spoken unto that I shall not insist upon it. I desire
   only that we would seriously consider how utterly ignorant we are of
   what is good for us or useful unto us in these outward things, and so
   leave them quietly unto God's disposal.

   4. We may consider that all these things about which we are troubled
   fall directly within the compass of that good word of God's grace, that
   he will make "all things work together for the good of them that love
   him," Rom. viii. 28. All things that we enjoy, all things that we are
   deprived of, all that we do, all that we suffer, our losses, troubles,
   miseries, distresses, in which the apostle instanceth in the following
   verses, they shall all "work together for good," -- together with one
   another, and all with and in subordination unto the power, grace, and
   wisdom of God. It may be, we see not how or by what means it may be
   effected; but he is infinitely wise and powerful who hath undertaken
   it, and we know little or nothing of his ways. There is nothing that we
   have, or enjoy, or desire, but it hath turned unto some unto their
   hurt. Riches have been kept for men unto their hurt. Wisdom and high
   places have been the ruin of many. Liberty and plenty are to most a
   snare. Prosperity slays the foolish. And we are not of ourselves in any
   measure able to secure ourselves from the hurt and poison that is in
   any of these things, but that they may be our ruin also, as they have
   already been, and every day are, unto multitudes of the children of
   men. It is enough to fill the soul of any man with horror and
   amazement, to consider the ways and ends of most of them that are
   intrusted with this world's goods. Is it not evident that all their
   lives they seem industriously to take care that they may perish
   eternally? Luxury, riot, oppression, intemperance, and of late
   especially, blasphemy and atheism, they usually give up themselves
   unto. And this is the fruit of their abundance and security. What, now,
   if God should deprive us of all these things? Can any one certainly say
   that he is worsted thereby? Might they not have turned unto his
   everlasting perdition, as well as they do so of thousands as good by
   nature, and who have had advantages to be as wise as we? And shall we
   complain of God's dispensations about them? And what shall we say when
   he himself hath undertaken to make all things that he guides us unto to
   work together for our good? Anxieties of mind and perplexities of heart
   about our losses is not that which we are called unto in our troubles.
   But this is that which is our duty, -- let us consider whether we "love
   God" or no, whether "we are called according to his purpose." If so,
   all things are well in his hand, who call order them for our good and
   advantage. I hope many a poor soul will from hence, under all their
   trouble, be able to say, with him that was banished from his country,
   and found better entertainment elsewhere, "My friends, I had perished,
   if I had not perished; -- had I not been undone by fire, it may be I
   had been ruined in eternal fire. God hath made all to work for my
   good."

   The end of all these discourses is, to evince the reasonableness of the
   duty of waiting on God, which we are pressing from the psalmist.
   Ignorance of God and ourselves is the great principle and cause of all
   our disquietments; and this ariseth mostly, not from want of light and
   instruction, but for want of consideration and application. The notions
   insisted on concerning God are obvious and known unto all; so are these
   concerning ourselves: but by whom almost are they employed and improved
   as they ought? The frame of our spirits is as though we stood upon
   equal terms with God, and did think, with Jonah, that we might do well
   to be angry with what he doth. Did we rightly consider him, did we
   stand in awe of him as we ought, it had certainly been otherwise with
   us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Influence of the promises into the soul's waiting in time of trouble --
   The nature of them.

   Having, therefore, laid down these considerations from the second
   observation taken from the words, -- namely, that Jehovah himself is
   the proper object of the soul's waiting in the condition described, --
   I shall only add one direction, how we may be enabled to perform and
   discharge this duty aright, which we have manifested to have been so
   necessary, so reasonable, so prevalent for the obtaining of relief; and
   this ariseth from another of the propositions laid down for the opening
   of these verses, not as yet spoken unto, -- namely, that the word of
   promise is the soul's great supportment in waiting for God.

   So saith the psalmist, "In his word do I hope;" that is, the word of
   promise. As the word in general is the adequate rule of all our
   obedience unto God and communion with him, so there are especial parts
   of it that are suited unto these especial actings of our souls towards
   him. Thus the word of promise, or the promise in the word, is that
   which our faith especially regards in our hope, trust, and waiting on
   God; and it is suited to answer unto the immediate actings of our souls
   therein. From this word of promise, therefore, that is, from these
   promises, doth the soul in its distress take encouragement to continue
   waiting on God; and that on these two accounts:--

   First, Because they are declarative of God, his mind and his will; and,
   secondly, Because they are communicative of grace and strength to the
   soul; -- of which latter we shall not here treat.

   First, The end and use of the promise is, to declare, reveal, and make
   known God unto believers; and that, in an especial manner, in him and
   concerning him which may give them encouragement to wait for him --

   1. The promises are a declaration of the nature of God, especially of
   his goodness, grace, and love. God hath put an impression of all the
   glorious excellencies of his nature on his word, especially, as he is
   in Christ, on the word of the gospel. There, as in a glass, do we
   behold his glory in the face of Jesus Christ. As his commands express
   unto us his holiness, his threatenings, his righteousness, and
   severity; so do his promises, his goodness, grace, love, and bounty.
   And in these things do we learn all that we truly and solidly know of
   God; that is, we know him in and by his word. The soul, therefore, that
   in this condition is waiting on or for God, considers the
   representation which he makes of himself and of his own nature in and
   by the promises, and receives supportment and encouragement in his
   duty; for if God teach us by the promises what he is, and what he will
   be unto us, we have firm ground to expect from him all fruits of
   benignity, kindness, and love. Let the soul frame in itself that idea
   of God which is exhibited in the promises, and it will powerfully
   prevail with it to continue in an expectation of his gracious returns;
   they all expressing goodness, love, patience, forbearance,
   long-suffering, pardoning mercy, grace, bounty, with a full
   satisfactory reward. This is the beauty of the Lord mentioned with
   admiration by the prophet, "How great is his goodness! how great is his
   beauty!" Zech. ix. 17; which is the great attractive of the soul to
   adhere constantly unto him. Whatever difficulties arise, whatever
   temptations interpose, or wearisomeness grows upon us, in our straits,
   troubles, trials, and desertions, let us not entertain such thoughts of
   God as our own perplexed imaginations may be apt to suggest unto us.
   This would quickly east us into a thousand impatiences, misgivings, and
   miscarriages. But the remembrance of and meditation on God in his
   promises, as revealed by them, as expressed in them, is suited quite
   unto other ends and purposes. There appear, yea, gloriously shine
   forth, that love, that wisdom, that goodness, tenderness, and grace, as
   cannot but encourage a believing soul to abide in waiting for him.

   2. The word of promise doth not only express God's nature as that
   wherein he proposeth himself unto the contemplation of faith, but it
   also declares his will and purpose of acting towards the soul suitably
   unto his own goodness and grace: for promises are the declarations of
   God's purpose and will to act towards believers in Christ Jesus
   according to the infinite goodness of his own nature; and this is done
   in great variety, according to the various conditions and wants of them
   that do believe. They all proceed from the same spring of infinite
   grace, but are branched into innumerable particular streams, according
   as our necessities do require. To these do waiting souls repair, for
   stay and encouragement. Their perplexities principally arise from their
   misapprehensions of what God is in himself, and of what he will be unto
   them; and whither should they repair to be undeceived but unto that
   faithful representation that he hath made of himself and his will in
   the word of his grace? for "No man hath seen God at any time; the
   only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
   him," John i. 18. Now, the gospel is nothing but the word of promise
   explained, in all the springs, causes, and effects of it. Thither must
   we repair, to be instructed in this matter. The imaginations and
   reasonings of men's hearts will but deceive them in these things. The
   informations or instructions of other men may do so; nor have they any
   truth in them farther than they may be resolved into the word of
   promise. Here alone they may find rest and refreshment. The soul of
   whom we speak is under troubles, perplexities, and distresses as to its
   outward condition, -- pressed with many straits, it may be, on every
   hand; and as to its spiritual estate, under various apprehensions of
   the mind and will of God towards it; as hath before at large been
   explained. In this condition it is brought, in some measure, unto a
   holy submission unto God, and a patient waiting for the issue of its
   trials. In this estate it hath many temptations to, and much working
   of, unbelief. The whole of its opposition amounts to this, that it is
   neglected of God. -- that its way is hid, and his judgment is passed
   over from him, -- that it shall not be at present delivered, nor
   hereafter saved. What course can any one advise such a one unto for his
   relief, and to preserve his soul from fainting or deserting the duty of
   waiting on God wherein he is engaged, but only this, to search and
   inquire what revelation God hath made of himself and his will
   concerning him in his word? And this the promise declares. Here he
   shall find hope, patience, faith, expectation, to be all increased,
   comforted, encouraged. Herein lies the duty and safety of any in this
   condition. Men may bear the first impression of any trouble with the
   strength, courage, and resolution of their natural spirits. Under some
   continuance of them they may support themselves with former
   experiences, and other usual springs and means of consolation. But if
   their wounds prove difficult to be cured, if they despise ordinary
   remedies, if their diseases are of long continuance, this is that which
   they must betake themselves unto -- They must search into the word of
   promise, and learn to measure things, not according to the present
   state and apprehensions of their mind, but according unto what God hath
   declared concerning them. And there are sundry excellencies in the
   promises, when hoped in or trusted in, that tend unto the establishment
   of the soul in this great duty of waiting; as, --

   (1.) That grace in them, that is, the good-will of God in Christ for
   help, relief, satisfaction, pardon, and salvation, -- is suited unto
   all particular conditions and wants of the soul. As light ariseth from
   the sun, and is diffused in the beams thereof to the especial use of
   all creatures enabled by a visive faculty to make use of it; so cometh
   grace forth from the eternal good-will of God in Christ, and is
   diffused by the promises, with a blessed contemporation unto the
   conditions and wants of all believers. There can nothing fall out
   between God and any soul but there is grace suited unto it, in one
   promise or another, as dearly and evidently as if it were given unto
   him particularly and immediately. And this they find by experience who
   at any time are enabled to mix effectually a promise with faith.

   (2.) The word of promise hath a wonderful, mysterious, especial
   impression of God upon it. He doth by it secretly and ineffably
   communicate himself unto believers. When God appeared in a dream unto
   Jacob, he awaked and said, "God is in this place, and I knew it not."
   tie knew God was everywhere, but an intimation of his especial presence
   surprised him. So is a soul surprised, when God opens himself and his
   grace in a promise unto him. It cries out, "God is here, and I knew it
   not." Such a near approach of God in his grace it finds, as is
   accompanied with a refreshing surprisal.

   (3.) There is an especial engagement of the veracity and truth of God
   in every promise. Grace and truth are the two ingredients of an
   evangelical promise, the matter and form whereof they do consist. I
   cannot now stay to show wherein this especial engagement of truth in
   the promise doth consist; besides, it is a thing known and confessed.
   But it hath an especial influence to support the soul, when hoped in,
   in its duty of waiting; for that hope can never make ashamed or leave
   the soul unto disappointments which stays itself on divine veracity
   under a special engagement.

   And this is that duty which the psalmist engageth himself in and unto
   the performance of, as the only way to obtain a comfortable interest in
   that forgiveness which is with God, and all the gracious effects
   thereof. And in the handling hereof, as we have declared its nature and
   necessity, so we have the psalmist's directions for its practice, unto
   persons in the like condition with him, for the attaining of the end by
   him aimed at; so that it needs no farther application. That which
   remains of the psalm is the address which he makes unto others, with
   the encouragement which he gives them to steer the same course with
   himself; and this he doth in the two last verses, which, to complete
   the exposition of the whole psalm, I shall briefly explain and pass
   through, as having already despatched what I principally aimed at.
     __________________________________________________________________

                           Verses seventh and eighth.

   "Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there is mercy, and
   with him is plenteous redemption. And he shall redeem Israel from all
   his iniquities."

   I shall proceed, in the opening of these words, according unto the
   method already insisted on. First, the meaning of the principal words
   shall be declared; then, the sense and importance of the whole;
   thirdly, the relation that they have unto the condition of the soul
   expressed in the psalm must be manifested; -- from all which
   observations will arise for our instruction and direction in the like
   cases, wherein we are or may be concerned.

   First. Verse 7. "Let Israel hope in the Lord:" ychl ysr'l 'lyhvh?,
   "Hope, Israel, in Jehovah," -- "trust," or "expect;" the same word with
   that, verse 5, "In his word do I hope;" properly, to expect, to look
   for, which includes hope, and adds some farther degree of the soul's
   acting towards God. It is an earnest looking after the thing hoped for:
   "Expecta ad Dominum," -- hope in him, and look up to him.

   "For with the Lord, -- quia, or quoniam, because seeing that with the
   Lord, -- hchsd?, "mercy." The verb substantive, as usual, is omitted,
   which we supply, "There is mercy," -- grace, bounty, goodness,
   good-will. This word is often joined with another, discovering its
   importance; and that is 'mt?, "truth:" chsd v'mt?, "goodness," or
   "mercy and truth." These are, as it were, constituent parts of God's
   promises. It is of goodness, grace, bounty, to promise any undue mercy;
   and it is of truth or faithfulness to make good what is so promised.
   The LXX. commonly render this word by eleos, -- that is, "pardoning
   mercy," as it is everywhere used in the New Testament.

   "And with him is plenteous redemption:" mv?, "with him," as before,
   speaking unto God, verse 4, mk?, "with thee there is;" the meaning of
   which expression hath been opened at large. "Redemption:" phdvt?, from
   phdh?, "to redeem;" the same with phdyvn?, lutrosis, apolutrosis,
   "redemption." This word is often used for a proper redemption, such as
   is made by the intervention of a price, and not a mere assertion unto
   liberty by power, which is sometimes also called redemption. Thus it is
   said of the money that the first-born of the children of Israel, which
   were above the number of the Levites, were redeemed with, that Moses
   took hphdyvm?, the "redemption;" that is, the redemption-money, the
   price of their redemption, Numb. iii. 49, Ps. xlix. 8. The redemption
   of men's souls is precious; it cost a great price. The redemption,
   then, that is with God relates unto a price. Goodness or mercy, with
   respect unto a price, becomes redemption; that is, actively the cause
   or means of it. What that price is, see Matt. xx. 28; 1 Pet. i. 18.

   "Plenteous redemption:" hrvh?, "Multa, copiosa," -- much, abundant,
   plenteous. It is used both for quantity and quality: much in quantity,
   or plenteous, abundant; and in quality, -- that is, precious,
   excellent. And it is applied in a good and bad sense. So it is said of
   our sins, Ezra ix. 6, "Our sins," rvv?, "are increased" or
   "multiplied," or are "great;" many in number, and heinous in their
   nature or quality. And in the other sense it is applied unto the mercy
   of God, whereby they are removed; it is great or plenteous, it is
   excellent or precious.

   Verse 8. "And he," -- that is, the Lord Jehovah, he with whom is
   plenteous redemption, -- yphdh?, "shall redeem," or make them partakers
   of that redemption that is with him. "He shall redeem Israel," -- that
   is, those who hope and trust in him.

   "From all his iniquities:" mkl vnvtyv?, "His iniquities; that is, of
   the elect of Israel, and every individual amongst them. But the word
   signifies trouble as well as sin, especially that trouble or punishment
   that is for sin. So Cain expresseth himself upon the denunciation of
   his sentence: gdvl vny mnsv'?, "My sin," -- that is, the punishment
   thou hast denounced against my sin, -- "is too great or heavy for me to
   bear," Gen. iv. 13. There is a near affinity between sin and trouble:
   "Noxam poena sequitur;" -- "Punishment is inseparable from iniquity."
   vn?, then, the word here used, signifies either sin with reference unto
   trouble due to it, or trouble with respect unto sin, whence it
   proceeds; and both may here be well intended: "God shall redeem Israel
   from all his sins, and troubles that have ensued thereon." And this is
   the signification of the words; which, indeed, are plain and obvious.

   And these words close up the psalm. He who began with depths, -- his
   own depths of sin and trouble, -- out of which and about which he cried
   out unto God, is so encouraged by that prospect of grace and
   forgiveness with God, which by faith he had obtained, as to preach unto
   others, and to support them in expectation of deliverance from all
   their sin and trouble also.

   And such, for the most part, are all the exercises and trials of the
   children of God. Their entrance may be a storm, but their close is a
   calm; their beginning is oftentimes trouble, but their latter end is
   peace, -- peace to themselves, and advantage to the church of God: for
   men in all ages coming out of great trials of their own have been the
   most instrumental for the good of others, for God doth not greatly
   exercise any of his but with some especial end for his own glory.

   Secondly, The sense and intendment of the psalmist in these words is to
   be considered; and that resolves itself into three general parts:--

   1. An exhortation or admonition: "Israel, hope in the Lord," or "expect
   Jehovah."

   2. A ground of encouragement unto the performance of the duty exhorted
   unto: "Because with the Lord there is much, plenteous, abundant,
   precious redemption."

   3. A gracious promise of a blessed issue, which shall be given unto the
   performance of this duty: "He shall redeem Israel from all his sins,
   and out of all his troubles."

   1. In the exhortation there occur, --

   (1.) The persons exhorted, -- that is, Israel: not Israel according to
   the flesh, for "they are not all Israel which are of Israel," Rom. ix.
   6; but it is the Israel mentioned, Ps. lxxiii. 1, the whole Israel of
   God, to whom he is good, "such as are of a clean heart," -- that is,
   all those who are interested in the covenant, and do inherit the
   promise of their forefather who was first called by that name, all
   believers. And the psalmist treats them all in general in this matter,
   --

   [1.] Because there is none of them but have their trials and
   entanglements about sin, more or less. As there is "none that liveth
   and sinneth not," so there is none that sinneth and is not entangled
   and troubled. Perhaps, then, they are not all of them in the same
   condition with him, in the depths that he was plunged into. Yet more or
   less, all and every one of them is so far concerned in sin as to need
   his direction. All the saints of God either have been, or are, or may
   be, in these depths. It is a good swing of Austin on this place, "Valde
   sunt in profundo qui non clamant de profundo;" -- "None so in the deep
   as they who do not cry and call out of the deep." They are in a deep of
   security who are never sensible of a deep of sin.

   [2.] There is none of them, whatever their present condition be, but
   they may fall into the like depths with those of the psalmist. There is
   nothing absolutely in the covenant, nor in any promise, to secure them
   from it. And what befalleth any one believer may befall them all. If
   any one believer may fall totally away, all may do so, and not leave
   one in the world, and so an end be put to the kingdom of Christ; which
   is no small evidence that they cannot so fall. But they may fall into
   depths of sin. That some of them have done so we have testimonies and
   instances beyond exception. It is good, then, that all of them should
   be prepared for that duty which they may all stand in need of, and for
   a right discharge of it. Besides, the duty mentioned is not absolutely
   restrained to the condition before described, but it is proper and
   accommodate unto other seasons also. Therefore are all the Israel of
   God exhorted unto it.

   (2.) The duty itself is, hoping in Jehovah, with such a hope or trust
   as hath an expectation of relief joined with it. And there are two
   things included in this duty --

   [1.] The renunciation of any hopes, in expectation of deliverance
   either from sin or trouble any other way: "Hope in Jehovah." This is
   frequently expressed where the performance of this duty is mentioned.
   See Hos. xiv. 3; Jer. iii 22, 23. And we have declared the nature of it
   in the exposition of the first and second verses.

   [2.] Expectation from him; and this also hath been insisted on, in the
   observations from the verses immediately preceding; wherein also the
   whole nature of this duty was explained, and directions were given for
   the due performance of it.

   2. The encouragement tendered unto this duty is the next thing in the
   words: "For with the Lord is plenteous redemption;" wherein we may
   observe, --

   (1.) What it is that he professeth as the great encouragement unto the
   duty mentioned; and that is redemption, -- the redemption that is with
   God: upon the matter, the same with the forgiveness before mentioned,
   mercy, pardon, benignity, bounty. He doth not bid them hope in the Lord
   because they were the seed of Abraham, the peculiar people of God, made
   partakers of privileges above all the people in the world; much less
   because of their worthiness, or that good that was in themselves; but
   merely upon the account of mercy in God, of his grace, goodness, and
   bounty. The mercy of God, and the redemption that is with him, is the
   only ground unto sinners for hope and confidence in him.

   (2.) There are two great concernments of this grace, -- the one
   expressed, the other implied in the words. The first is, that it is
   much, plenteous, abundant. That which principally discourageth
   distressed souls from a comfortable waiting on God is, their fears lest
   they should not obtain mercy from him, and that because their sins are
   so great and so many, or attended with such circumstances and
   aggravations, as that it is impossible they should find acceptance with
   God. This ground of despondency and unbelief the psalmist obviates by
   representing the fulness, the plenty, the boundless plenty, of the
   mercy that is with God. It is such as will suit the condition of the
   greatest sinners in their greatest depths; the stores of its treasures
   are inexhaustible. And the force of the exhortation doth not lie so
   much in this, that there is redemption with God, as that this
   redemption is plenteous or abundant. Secondly, Here is an intimation in
   the word itself of that relation which the goodness and grace of God
   proposed hath to the blood of Christ, whence it is called "Redemption."
   This, as was showed in the opening of the words, hath respect unto a
   price, the price whereby we are bought; that is, the blood of Christ.
   This is that whereby way is made for the exercise of mercy towards
   sinners. Redemption, which properly denotes actual deliverance, is said
   to be with God, or in him, as the effect in the cause. The causes of it
   are, his own grace and the blood of Christ. There are these prepared
   for the redeeming of believers from sin and trouble unto his own glory.
   And herein lieth the encouragement that the psalmist proposeth unto the
   performance of the duty exhorted unto, -- namely, to wait on God, -- it
   is taken from God himself, as all encouragements unto sinners to draw
   nigh unto him and to wait for him must be. Nothing but himself can give
   us confidence to go unto him; and it is suited unto the state and
   condition of the soul under consideration. Redemption and mercy are
   suited to give relief from sin and misery.

   3. The last verse contains a promise of the issue of the performance of
   this duty: "He shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities." Two things
   are observable in the words --

   (1.) The certainty of the issue or event of the duty mentioned: vhv'
   yphdh?, "And he shall," or "he will redeem;" he will assuredly do so.
   Now, although this in the psalmist is given out by revelation, and is a
   new promise of God, yet, as it relates to the condition of the soul
   here expressed, and the discovery made by faith of forgiveness and
   redemption with God, the certainty intended in this assertion is built
   upon the principles before laid down. Whence, therefore, doth it
   appear, whence may we infallibly conclude, that God will redeem his
   Israel from all their iniquities? I answer, --

   [1.] The conclusion is drawn from the nature of God. There is
   forgiveness and redemption with him, and he will act towards his people
   suitably to his own nature. There is redemption with him, and therefore
   he will redeem; forgiveness with him, and therefore he will forgive. As
   the conclusion is certain and infallible, that wicked men, ungodly men,
   shall be destroyed, because God is righteous and holy, his
   righteousness and holiness indispensably requiring their destruction;
   so is the redemption and salvation of all that believe certain on this
   account, -- namely, because there is forgiveness with him. He is good
   and gracious, and ready to forgive; his goodness and grace requires
   their salvation.

   [2.] The conclusion is certain upon the account of God's faithfulness
   in his promises. He hath promised that those who wait on him "shall not
   be ashamed," -- that their expectation shall not be disappointed;
   whence the conclusion is certain that in his time and way they shall be
   redeemed.

   (2.) There is the extent of this deliverance or redemption: "Shall
   redeem Israel from all his iniquities." It was showed, in the opening
   of the verse, that this word denotes either sin procuring trouble, or
   trouble procured by sin; and there is a respect unto both sin and its
   punishment. From both, from all of both kinds, God will redeem his
   Israel; not this or that evil, this or that sin, but from all evil, all
   sin. He will take all sins from their souls, and wipe all tears from
   their eyes. Now, God is said to do this on many accounts:

   [1.] On the account of the great cause of all actual deliverance and
   redemption, -- the blood of Christ. He hath laid an assured foundation
   of the whole work; the price of redemption is paid, and they shall in
   due time enjoy the effects and fruits of it.

   [2.] Of the actual communication of the effects of that redemption unto
   them. This is sure to all the elect of God, to his whole Israel. They
   shall all be made partakers of them. And this is the end of all the
   promises of God, and of the grace and mercy promised in them, --
   namely, that they should be means to exhibit and give out to believers
   that redemption which is purchased and prepared for them. And this is
   done two ways:--

   1st. Partially, initially, and gradually, in this life. Here God gives
   in unto them the pardon of their sins, being freely justified by his
   grace; and, in his sanctification of them through his Spirit, gives
   them delivery from the power and dominion of sin. Many troubles also he
   delivers them from, and from all as far as they are penal, or have any
   mixture of the curse in them.

   2dly. Completely, -- namely, when he shall have freed them from sin and
   trouble, and from all the effects and consequents of them, by bringing
   them unto the enjoyment of himself in glory.

   Thirdly, The words being thus opened, we may briefly, in the next
   place, consider what they express concerning the state, condition, or
   actings of the soul, which are represented in this psalm.

   Having himself attained unto the state before described, and being
   engaged resolvedly unto the performance of that duty which would
   assuredly bring him into a haven of full rest and peace, the psalmist
   applies himself unto the residue of the Israel of God, to give them
   encouragement unto this duty with himself, from the experience that he
   had of a blessed success therein. As if he had said unto them, "Ye are
   now in afflictions and under troubles, and that upon the account of
   your sins and provocations, -- a condition, I confess, sad and
   deplorable; but yet there is hope in Israel concerning these things.
   For consider how it hath been with me, and how the Lord hath dealt with
   me. I was in depths inexpressible, and saw for a while no way or means
   of delivery; but God hath been pleased graciously to reveal himself
   unto me, as a God pardoning iniquity, transgression, and sin. And in
   the consolation and supportment which I have received thereby, I am
   waiting for a full participation of the fruits of his love. Let me
   therefore prevail with you, who are in the like condition, to steer the
   same course with me. Only let your expectations be fixed on mercy and
   sovereign grace, without any regard unto any privilege or worth in
   yourselves. Rest in the plenteous redemption, those stores of grace
   which are with Jehovah; and according to his faithfulness in his
   promises he will deliver you out of all perplexing troubles."

   Having thus opened the words, I shall now only name the doctrinal
   observations that are tendered from them, and so put a close to these
   discourses; as, --

   Obs. 1. The Lord Jehovah is the only hope for sin-distressed souls:
   "Hope in the Lord." This hath been sufficiently discovered and
   confirmed on sundry passages in the psalm.

   Obs. 2. The ground of all hope and expectation of relief in sinners is
   mere grace, mercy, and redemption: "Hope in the Lord: for with the Lord
   there is mercy." All other grounds of hope are false and deceiving.

   Obs. 3. Inexhaustible stores of mercy and redemption are needful for
   the encouragement of sinners to rest and wait on God: "With him is
   plenteous redemption." Such is your misery, so pressing are your fears
   and disconsolations, that nothing less than boundless grace can relieve
   or support you; there are, therefore, such treasures and stores in God
   as are suited hereunto. "With him is plenteous redemption."

   Obs. 4. The ground of all the dispensation of mercy, goodness, grace,
   and forgiveness, which is in God to sinners, is laid in the blood of
   Christ; hence it is here called "Redemption." Unto this also we have
   spoken at large before.

   Obs. 5. All that wait on God on the account of mercy and grace shall
   have an undoubted issue of peace: "He shall redeem Israel." "Let him,"
   saith God, "lay hold on my arm, that he may have peace, and he shall
   have peace," Isa. xxvii. 5.

   Obs. 6. Mercy given to them that wait on God, shall, in the close and
   issue, be every way full and satisfying: "He shall redeem Israel from
   all his iniquities."

   And these propositions do arise from the words as absolutely
   considered, and in themselves. If we mind their relation unto the
   peculiar condition of the soul represented in this psalm, they will yet
   afford us the ensuing observations --

   Obs. 1. They who out of depths have, by faith and waiting, obtained
   mercy, or are supported in waiting from a sense of believed mercy and
   forgiveness, are fitted, arid only they are fitted, to preach and
   declare grace and mercy unto others. This was the case with the
   psalmist. Upon his emerging out of his own depths and straits, he
   declares the mercy and redemption whereby he was delivered unto the
   whole Israel of God.

   Obs. 2. A saving participation of grace and forgiveness leaves a deep
   impression of its fulness and excellency on the soul of a sinner. So
   was it here with the psalmist. Having himself obtained forgiveness, he
   knows no bounds or measure, as it were, in the extolling of it: "There
   is with God, mercy, redemption, plenteous redemption, redeeming from
   all iniquity; I have found it so, and so will every one do that shall
   believe it."

   Now, these observations might all of them, especially the two last,
   receive a useful improvement; but whereas what I principally intended
   from this psalm hath been at large insisted on upon the first verses of
   it, I shall not here farther draw forth any meditations upon them, but
   content myself with the exposition that hath been given of the design
   of the psalmist and sense of his words in these last verses.
