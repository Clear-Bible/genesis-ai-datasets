FOREWORD BY OLAN HENDRIX

   In more than twenty years in the ministry few books have influenced and
   helped me more than A. B. Bruce's The Training of the Twelve. I was
   delighted to discover that Kregel Publications was planning to reissue
   this very valuable book, and I thank God for their foresight in this
   undertaking. With confidence and enthusiasm I commend this volume to my
   fellow ministers throughout the English speaking world.

   As never before in the history of the Christian ministry the servant of
   Jesus Christ is constantly grappling with the problem of how to
   reproduce himself and multiply his endeavors so as to encounter our
   ever increasing world population with the gospel of Jesus Christ. This
   book, as few other books, gives the practical as well as the
   theological guidelines for the man of God working with his flock. Every
   pastor knows the frustration of looking out upon a broken and often
   hostile world and experiencing haunting limitations to meet those
   needs. Obviously, a part of the answer to this kind of frustration is
   the genius of "getting things done through other people." This is
   precisely what Jesus Christ did with his apostles. The pattern and the
   ageless principles of this endeavor on the part of our Lord is lifted
   from the Holy Scriptures to guide us in the day in which we live.

   The value of this volume is increased today as so many Christian
   workers are delving into the subject of management. For the first time
   in church history modern management techniques and principles are being
   sought out for their application to the local church, the mission, the
   missionary, and various types of Christian organizations. In the midst
   of this kind of upsurge of interest in management skills and tools it
   is increasingly vital that we have firmly fixed in our understanding
   the ageless management principles employed by our Lord in his
   relationships with his apostles.

   It is difficult to estimate the value of Bruce's instruction for the
   young pastor just beginning his ministry. It would be well for
   ordination councils to consider this as required reading for the young
   man facing ordination. I would recommend the book to my brethren who
   have been in the ministry for many years as an ideal refresher course
   to lift and inspire the servant of God. I have read and reread the book
   through the years of my own ministry and always with increasing profit.

   All of this is to say nothing of the devotional benefit of these
   blessed pages. How wonderful and encouraging to realize that the
   problems we face in working with our people whom the Holy Spirit has
   called out into our flocks or organizations are like the problems the
   Lord Jesus faced in the apostolate.

   Further, I am delighted for the reappearance of this volume because of
   the depth and stability it will unquestionably bring to the ministry in
   this day when superficiality and wavering tends to abound.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

   ON receiving notice from the publisher that a second edition of The
   Training of the Twelve which first appeared in 1871, was called for, I
   was obliged to consider the question what alterations should be made on
   a work which, though written with care, was too obviously, to my
   maturer judgment, stamped with imperfection. Two alternatives suggested
   themselves to my mind. One was to recast the whole, so as to give it a
   more critical and scientific character, and make it bear more directly
   on current controversies respecting the origin of Christianity. The
   other was to allow the book to remain substantially as it was,
   retaining its popular form, and limiting alterations to details
   susceptible of improvement without change of plan. After a little
   hesitation, I decided for the latter course, for the following reasons.
   From expressions of opinion that reached me from many and very diverse
   quarters, I had come to be convinced that the book was appreciated and
   found useful, and I thence concluded that, notwithstanding its faults,
   it might continue to be of service in its primitive shape. Then,
   considering how difficult in all things it is to serve two masters or
   accomplish at once two ends, I saw that the adoption of the former of
   the two alternative courses was tantamount to writing a new book, which
   could be done, if necessary, independently of the present publication.
   I confess to having a vague plan of such a work in my head, which may
   or may not be carried into effect. The TÃ¼bingen school of critics, with
   whose works English readers are now becoming acquainted through
   translations, maintain that catholic Christianity was the result of a
   compromise or reconciliation between two radically opposed tendencies,
   represented respectively by the original apostles and by Paul, the two
   tendencies being Judaistic exclusiveness on the one hand, and Pauline
   universalism on the other. The twelve said: Christianity for Jews, and
   all who are willing to become Jews by compliance with Jewish custom;
   Paul said: Christianity for the whole world, and for all on the same
   terms. Now the material dealt with in The Training of the Twelve, must,
   from the nature of the case, have some bearing on this conflict
   hypothesis of Dr. Barr and his friends. The question arises, What was
   to be expected of the men that were with Jesus? and the consideration
   of this question would form an important division of such a
   controversial work as I have in view. Another chapter might consider
   the part assigned to Peter in the Acts of the Apostles (alleged by the
   same school of critics to be a part invented for him by the writer for
   an apologetic purpose), seeking especially to determine whether it was
   a likely part for him to play -- likely in view of his idiosyncrasies,
   or the training he had received. Another appropriate topic would be the
   character of the Apostle John, as portrayed in the synoptical Gospels,
   in its bearing on the questions of the authorship of the fourth Gospel,
   and the hostility to Paul and his universalism alleged to be manifested
   in the Book of Revelation. In such a work there would further fall to
   be considered the materials bearing on the same theme in other parts of
   the New Testament, especially those to be found in the Epistle to the
   Galatians. Finally, there might not inappropriately be found a place in
   such a work for a discussion of the question, How far do the synoptical
   Gospels -- the principal sources of information regarding the teaching
   and public actions of Christ -- bear traces of the influence of
   controversial or conciliatory tendencies? e.g. what ground is there for
   the assertion that the mission of the seventy is an invention in the
   interest of Pauline universalism intended to throw the original
   apostles into the shade?

   In the present work I have not attempted to develop the argument here
   outlined, but have merely indicated the places at which the different
   points of the argument might come in, and the way in which they might
   be used. The conflict hypothesis was not absent from my mind in writing
   the book at first; but I was neither so well acquainted with the
   literature relating thereto, nor so sensible of its importance, as I am
   now.

   In preparing this new edition for the press, I have not lost sight of
   any hints from friendly critics which might tend to make it more
   acceptable and useful. In particular, I have kept steadily in view
   retrenchment of the homiletic element, though I am sensible that I may
   still have retained too much for some tastes, but I hope not too much
   for the generality of readers. I have had to remember, that while some
   friends called for condensation, others have complained that the matter
   was too closely packed. I have also had occasion to observe in my
   reading of books on the Gospel history that it is possible to be so
   brief and sketchy as to miss not only the latent connections of
   thought, but even the thoughts themselves. The changes have not all
   been in the direction of retrenchment. While not a few paragraphs have
   been cancelled or reduced in bulk, other new ones have been added, and
   in one or two instances whole pages have been rewritten. Among the more
   important additions may be mentioned a note at the end of the chapter
   relating to the farewell discourse, giving an analysis of the discourse
   into its component parts; and a concluding paragraph at the end of the
   work summing up the instructions which the twelve had received from
   Jesus during the time they had been with Him. Besides these, a feature
   of this edition is a series of footnotes referring to some of the
   principal recent publications, British and foreign, whose contents
   relate more or less to the Gospel history, such as the works of Keim,
   Pfleiderer, Golani, Farrar, Sanday, and Supernatural Religion. The
   notes referring to Mr. Sanday's work bear on the important question,
   how far we have in John's Gospel a reliable record of the words spoken
   by Jesus to His disciples on the eve of His passion.

   Besides the index of passages discussed which appeared in the first
   edition, this edition contains a carefully-prepared table of contents
   at the end, which it is hoped will add to the utility of the work. To
   make the bearing of the contents on the training of the disciples more
   apparent, I have in several instances changed the titles of chapters,
   or supplied alternative titles.

   With these explanations, I send forth this new edition, with grateful
   feelings for the kind reception which the work has already received,
   and in the hope that by the divine blessing it may continue to be of
   use as an attempt to illustrate an interesting and important theme.

1. BEGINNINGS

    John 1:29-51.

   The section of the Gospel history above indicated, possesses the
   interest peculiar to the beginnings of all things that have grown to
   greatness. Here are exhibited to our view the infant church in its
   cradle, the petty sources of the River of Life, the earliest blossoms
   of Christian faith, the humble origin of the mighty empire of the Lord
   Jesus Christ.

   All beginnings are more or less obscure in appearance, but none were
   ever more obscure than those of Christianity. What an insignificant
   event in the history of the church, not to say of the world, this first
   meeting of Jesus of Nazareth with five humble men, Andrew, Peter,
   Philip, Nathanael, and another unnamed! It actually seems almost too
   trivial to find a place even in the evangelic narrative. For we have
   here to do not with any formal solemn call to the great office of the
   apostleship, or even with the commencement of an uninterrupted
   discipleship, but at the utmost with the beginnings of an acquaintance
   with and of faith in Jesus on the part of certain individuals who
   subsequently became constant attendants on His person, and ultimately
   apostles of His religion. Accordingly we find no mention made in the
   three first Gospels of the events here recorded.

   Far from being surprised at the silence of the synoptical evangelists,
   one is rather tempted to wonder how it came to pass that John, the
   author of the fourth Gospel, after the lapse of so many years, thought
   it worth while to relate incidents so minute, especially in such close
   proximity to the sublime sentences with which his Gospel begins. But we
   are kept from such incredulous wonder by the reflection, that facts
   objectively insignificant may be very important to the feelings of
   those whom they personally concern. What if John were himself one of
   the five who on the present occasion became acquainted with Jesus? That
   would make a wide difference between him and the other evangelists, who
   could know of the incidents here related, if they knew of them at all,
   only at second hand. In the case supposed, it would not be surprising
   that to his latest hour John remembered with emotion the first time he
   saw the Incarnate Word, and deemed the minutest memorials of that time
   unspeakably precious. First meetings are sacred as well as last ones,
   especially such as are followed by a momentous history, and
   accompanied, as is apt to be the case, with omens prophetic of the
   future. [1] Such omens were not wanting in connection with the first
   meeting between Jesus and the five disciples. Did not the Baptist then
   first give to Jesus the name "Lamb of God," so exactly descriptive of
   His earthly mission and destiny? Was not Nathanael's doubting question,
   "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" an ominous indication of a
   conflict with unbelief awaiting the Messiah? And what a happy omen of
   an opening era of wonders to be wrought by divine grace and power was
   contained in the promise of Jesus to the pious, though at first
   doubting, Israelite: "Henceforth ye shall see heaven open, and the
   angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man"!

   That John, the writer of the fourth Gospel, really was the fifth
   unnamed disciple, may be regarded as certain. It is his way throughout
   his Gospel, when alluding to himself, to use a periphrasis, or to
   leave, as here, a blank where his name should be. One of the two
   disciples who heard the Baptist call Jesus the Lamb of God was the
   evangelist himself, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, being the other. [2]

   The impressions produced on our minds by these little anecdotes of the
   infancy of the Gospel must be feeble, indeed, as compared with the
   emotions awakened by the memory of them in the breast of the aged
   apostle by whom they are recorded. It would not, however, be creditable
   either to our intelligence or to our piety if we could peruse this page
   of the evangelic history unmoved, as if it were utterly devoid of
   interest. We should address ourselves to the study of the simple story
   with somewhat of the feeling with which men make pilgrimages to sacred
   places; for indeed the ground is holy.

   The scene of the occurrences in which we are concerned was in the
   region of Persia, on the banks of the Jordan, at the lower part of its
   course. The persons who make their appearance on the scene were all
   natives of Galilee, and their presence here is due to the fame of the
   remarkable man whose office it was to be the forerunner of the Christ.
   John, surnamed the Baptist, who had spent his youth in the desert as a
   hermit, living on locusts and wild honey, and clad in a garment of
   camel's hair, had come forth from his retreat, and appeared among men
   as a prophet of God. The burden of his prophecy was, "Repent, for the
   kingdom of heaven is at hand." In a short time many were attracted from
   all quarters to see and hear him. Of those who flocked to his
   preaching, the greater number went as they came; but not a few were
   deeply impressed, and, confessing their sins, underwent the rite of
   baptism in the waters of the Jordan. Of those who were baptized, a
   select number formed themselves into a circle of disciples around the
   person of the Baptist, among whom were at least two, and most probably
   the whole, of the five men mentioned by the evangelist. Previous
   converse with the Baptist had awakened in these disciples a desire to
   see Jesus, and prepared them for believing in Him. In his
   communications to the people around him John made frequent allusions to
   One who should come after himself. He spoke of this coming One in
   language fitted to awaken great expectations. He called himself, with
   reference to the coming One, a mere voice in the wilderness, crying,
   "Prepare ye the way of the Lord." At another time he said, "I baptize
   with water; but there standeth One among you whom ye know not: He it is
   who, coming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am
   not worthy to unloose." This great One was none other than the Messiah,
   the Son of God, the King of Israel.

   Such discourses were likely to result, and by the man of God who
   uttered them they were intended to result, in the disciples of the
   Baptist leaving him and going over to Jesus. And we see here the
   process of transition actually commencing. We do not affirm that the
   persons here named finally quitted the Baptist's company at this time,
   to become henceforth regular followers of Jesus. But an acquaintance
   now begins which will end in that. The bride is introduced to the
   Bridegroom, and the marriage will come in due season; not to the
   chagrin but to the joy of the Bridegroom's friend. [3]

   How easily and artlessly does the mystic bride, as represented by these
   five disciples, become acquainted with her heavenly Bridegroom! The
   account of their meeting is idyllic in its simplicity, and would only
   be spoiled by a commentary. There is no need of formal introduction:
   they all introduce each other. Even John and Andrew were not formally
   introduced to Jesus by the Baptist; they rather introduced themselves.
   The exclamation of the desert prophet on seeing Jesus, "Behold the Lamb
   of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" repeated next day in
   an abbreviated form, was the involuntary utterance of one absorbed in
   his own thoughts, rather than the deliberate speech of one who was
   directing his disciples to leave himself and go over to Him of whom he
   spake. The two disciples, on the other hand, in going away after the
   personage whose presence had been so impressively announced, were not
   obeying an order given by their old master, but were simply following
   the dictates of feelings which had been awakened in their breasts by
   all they had heard him say of Jesus, both on the present and on former
   occasions. They needed no injunction to seek the acquaintance of one in
   whom they felt so keenly interested: all they needed was to know that
   this was He. They were as anxious to see the Messianic King as the
   world is to see the face of a secular prince.

   It is natural that we should scan the evangelical narrative for
   indications of character with reference to those who, in the way so
   quaintly described, for the first time met Jesus. Little is said of the
   five disciples, but there is enough to show that they were all pious
   men. What they found in their new friend indicates what they wanted to
   find. They evidently belonged to the select band who waited for the
   consolation of Israel, and anxiously looked for Him who should fulfil
   God's promises and realize the hopes of all devout souls. Besides this
   general indication of character supplied in their common confession of
   faith, a few facts are stated respecting these first believers in Jesus
   tending to make us a little better acquainted with them. Two of them
   certainly, all of them probably, had been disciples of the Baptist.
   This fact is decisive as to their moral earnestness. From such a
   quarter none but spiritually earnest men were likely to come. For if
   the followers of John were at all like himself, they were men who
   hungered and thirsted after real righteousness, being sick of the
   righteousness then in vogue; they said Amen in their hearts to the
   preacher's withering exposure of the hollowness of current religious
   profession and of the worthlessness of fashionable good works, and
   sighed for a sanctity other than that of pharisaic superstition and
   ostentation; their conscience acknowledged the truth of the prophetic
   oracle, "We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses
   are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf, and our iniquities
   like the wind have taken us away;." and they prayed fervently for the
   reviving of true religion, for the coming of the divine kingdom, for
   the advent of the Messianic King with fan in His hand to separate chaff
   from wheat, and to put right all things which were wrong. Such, without
   doubt, were the sentiments of those who had the honor to be the first
   disciples of Christ.

   Simon, best known of all the twelve under the name of Peter, is
   introduced to us here, through the prophetic insight of Jesus, on the
   good side of his character as the man of rock. When this disciple was
   brought by his brother Andrew into the presence of his future Master,
   Jesus, we are told, "beheld him and said, Thou art Simon the son of
   Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas" -- Cephas meaning in Syriac, as the
   evangelist explains, the same which Petros signifies in Greek. The
   penetrating glance of Christ discerned in this disciple latent
   capacities of faith and devotion, the rudiments of ultimate strength
   and power.

   What manner of man Philip was the evangelist does not directly tell us,
   but merely whence he came. From the present passage, and from other
   notices in the Gospels, the conclusion has been drawn that he was
   characteristically deliberate, slow in arriving at decision; and for
   proof of this view, reference has been made to the "phlegmatic
   circumstantiality" [4] with which he described to Nathanael the person
   of Him with whom he had just become acquainted. [5] But these words of
   Philip, and all that we elsewhere read of him, rather suggest to us the
   idea of the earnest inquirer after truth, who has thoroughly searched
   the Scriptures and made himself acquainted with the Messiah of promise
   and prophecy, and to whom the knowledge of God is the summum bonum. In
   the solicitude manifested by this disciple to win his friend Nathanael
   over to the same faith we recognize that generous sympathetic spirit,
   characteristic of earnest inquirers, which afterwards revealed itself
   in him when he became the bearer of the request of devout Greeks for
   permission to see Jesus. [6]

   The notices concerning Nathanael, Philip's acquaintance, are more
   detailed and more interesting than in the case of any other of the
   five; and it is not a little surprising that we should be told so much
   in this place about one concerning whom we otherwise know almost
   nothing. It is even not quite certain that he belonged to the circle of
   the twelve, though the probability is, that he is to be identified with
   the Bartholomew of the synoptical catalogues -- his full name in that
   case being Nathanael the son of Tolmai. It is strongly in favor of this
   supposition that the name Bartholomew comes immediately after Philip in
   the lists of the apostles. [7] Be this as it may, we know on the best
   authority that Nathanael was a man of great moral excellence. No sooner
   had Jesus seen him than He exclaimed, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in
   whom is no guile!" The words suggest the idea of one whose heart was
   pure; in whom was no doublemindedness, impure motive, pride, or unholy
   passion: a man of gentle, meditative spirit, in whose mind heaven lay
   reflected like the blue sky in a still lake on a calm summer day. He
   was a man much addicted to habits of devotion: he had been engaged in
   spiritual exercises under cover of a fig-tree just before he met with
   Jesus. So we are justified in concluding, from the deep impression made
   on his mind by the words of Jesus, "Before that Philip called thee,
   when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee." Nathanael appears to
   have understood these words as meaning, "I saw into thy heart, and knew
   how thou wast occupied, and therefore I pronounced thee an Israelite
   indeed." He accepted the statement made to him by Jesus as an evidence
   of preternatural knowledge, and therefore he forthwith made the
   confession, "Rabbi! Thou art the Son of God; Thou art the King of
   Israel" -- the King of that sacred commonwealth whereof you say I am a
   citizen.

   It is remarkable that this man, so highly endowed with the moral
   dispositions necessary for seeing God, should have been the only one of
   all the five disciples who manifested any hesitancy about receiving
   Jesus as the Christ. When Philip told him that he had found the Messiah
   in Jesus of Nazareth, he asked incredulously, "Can there any good thing
   come out of Nazareth?" One hardly expects such prejudice in one so meek
   and amiable; and yet, on reflection, we perceive it to be quite
   characteristic. Nathanael's prejudice against Nazareth sprung not from
   pride, as in the case of the people of Judea who despised the Galileans
   in general, but from humility. He was a Galilean himself, and as much
   an object of Jewish contempt as were the Nazarenes. His inward thought
   was, "Surely the Messiah can never come from among a poor despised
   people such as we are -- from Nazareth or any other Galilean town or
   village!" [8] He timidly allowed his mind to be biased by a current
   opinion originating in feelings with which he had no sympathy; a fault
   common to men whose piety, though pure and sincere, defers too much to
   human authority, and who thus become the slaves of sentiments utterly
   unworthy of them.

   While Nathanael was not free from prejudices, he showed his
   guilelessness in being willing to have them removed. He came and saw.
   This openness to conviction is the mark of moral integrity. The
   guileless man dogmatizes not, but investigates, and therefore always
   comes right in the end. The man of bad, dishonest heart, on the
   contrary, does not come and see. Deeming it his interest to remain in
   his present mind, he studiously avoids looking at aught which does not
   tend to confirm his foregone conclusions. He may, indeed, profess a
   desire for inquiry, like certain Israelites of whom we read in this
   same Gospel, of another stamp than Nathanael, but sharing with him the
   prejudice against Galilee. "Search and look," said these Israelites not
   without guile, in reply to the ingenuous question of the honest but
   timid Nicodemus: "Doth our law judge any man before it hear him, and
   know what he doeth?" "Search and look," said they, appealing to
   observation and inviting inquiry; but they added: "For out of Galilee
   ariseth no prophet" [9] -- a dictum which at once prohibited inquiry in
   effect, and intimated that it was unnecessary. "Search and look; but we
   tell you beforehand you cannot arrive at any other conclusion than
   ours; nay, we warn you, you had better not."

   Such were the characters of the men who first believed in Jesus. What,
   now, was the amount and value of their belief? On first view the faith
   of the five disciples, leaving out of account the brief hesitation of
   Nathanael, seems unnaturally sudden and mature. They believe in Jesus
   on a moment's notice, and they express their faith in terms which seem
   appropriate only to advanced Christian intelligence. In the present
   section of John's Gospel we find Jesus called not merely the Christ,
   the Messiah, the King of Israel, but the Son of God and the Lamb of God
   -- names expressive to us of the cardinal doctrines of Christianity,
   the Incarnation and the Atonement.

   The haste and maturity which seem to characterize the faith of the five
   disciples are only superficial appearances. As to the former: these men
   believed that Messiah was to come some time; and they wished much it
   might be then, for they felt He was greatly needed. They were men who
   waited for the consolation of Israel, and they were prepared at any
   moment to witness the advent of the Comforter. Then the Baptist had
   told them that the Christ was come, and that He was to be found in the
   person of Him whom he had baptized, and whose baptism had been
   accompanied with such remarkable signs from heaven; and what the
   Baptist said they implicitly believed. Finally, the impression produced
   on their minds by the bearing of Jesus when they met, tended to confirm
   John's testimony, being altogether worthy of the Christ.

   The appearance of maturity in the faith of the five brethren is equally
   superficial. As to the name Lamb of God, it was given to Jesus by John,
   not by them. It was, so to speak, the baptismal name which the preacher
   of repentance had learned by reflection, or by special revelation, to
   give to the Christ. What the name signified even he but dimly
   comprehended, the very repetition of it showing him to be but a learner
   striving to get up his lesson; and we know that what John understood
   only in part, the men whom he introduced to the acquaintance of Jesus,
   now and for long after, understood not at all. [10]

   The title Son of God was given to Jesus by one of the five disciples as
   well as by the Baptist, a title which even the apostles in after years
   found sufficient to express their mature belief respecting the Person
   of their Lord. But it does not follow that the name was used by them at
   the beginning with the same fulness of meaning as at the end. It was a
   name which could be used in a sense coming far short of that which it
   is capable of conveying, and which it did convey in apostolic preaching
   -- merely as one of the Old Testament titles of Messiah, a synonyme for
   Christ. It was doubtless in this rudimentary sense that Nathanael
   applied the designation to Him, whom he also called the King of Israel.

   The faith of these brethren was, therefore, just such as we should
   expect in beginners. In substance it amounted to this, that they
   recognized in Jesus the Divine Prophet, King, Son of Old Testament
   prophecy; and its value lay not in its maturity, or accuracy, but in
   this, that however imperfect, it brought them into contact and close
   fellowship with Him, in whose company they were to see greater things
   than when they first believed, one truth after another assuming its
   place in the firmament of their minds, like the stars appearing in the
   evening sky as daylight fades away.

   certainly give one a surprise. And yet is it not more surprising to
   find such a passage as the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah, on any
   interpretation of it, in an Old Testament book? And being there, why
   wonder that this title was in John's mouth? That John understood the
   full import of his own words we are not bound, or even entitled, to
   believe. Why should not the utterance be as much a mystery for him as,
   according to the Apostle Peter, similar utterances by older prophets
   were to them?

2. FISHERS OF MEN

    Matt. 4:18-22; Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11.

   The twelve arrived at their final intimate relation to Jesus only by
   degrees, three stages in the history of their fellowship with Him being
   distinguishable. In the first stage they were simply believers in Him
   as the Christ, and His occasional companions at convenient,
   particularly festive, seasons. Of this earliest stage in the
   intercourse of the disciples with their Master we have some memorials
   in the four first chapters of John's Gospel, which tell how some of
   them first became acquainted with Jesus, and represent them as
   accompanying Him at a marriage in Cana, [11] at a passover in
   Jerusalem, [12] on a visit to the scene of the Baptist's ministry, [13]
   and on the return journey through Samaria from the south to Galilee.
   [14]

   In the second stage, fellowship with Christ assumed the form of an
   uninterrupted attendance on His person, involving entire, or at least
   habitual abandonment of secular occupations. [15] The present
   narratives bring under our view certain of the disciples entering on
   this second stage of discipleship. Of the four persons here named, we
   recognize three, Peter, Andrew, and John, as old acquaintances, who
   have already passed through the first stage of discipleship. One of
   them, James the brother of John, we meet with for the first time; a
   fact which suggests the remark, that in some cases the first and second
   stages may have been blended together -- professions of faith in Jesus
   as the Christ being immediately followed by the renunciation of secular
   callings for the purpose of joining His company. Such cases, however,
   were probably exceptional and few.

   The twelve entered on the last and highest stage of discipleship when
   they were chosen by their Master from the mass of His followers, and
   formed into a select band, to be trained for the great work of the
   apostleship. This important event probably did not take place till all
   the members of the apostolic circle had been for some time about the
   person of Jesus.

   From the evangelic records it appears that Jesus began at a very early
   period of His ministry to gather round Him a company of disciples, with
   a view to the preparation of an agency for carrying on the work of the
   divine kingdom. The two pairs of brothers received their call at the
   commencement of the first Galilean ministry, in which the first act was
   the selection of Capernaum by the seaside as the centre of operations
   and ordinary place of abode. [16] And when we think what they were
   called unto, we see that the call could not come too soon. The twelve
   were to be Christ's witnesses in the world after He Himself had left
   it; it was to be their peculiar duty to give to the world a faithful
   account of their Master's words and deeds, a just image of His
   character, a true reflection of His spirit. [17] This service obviously
   could be rendered only by persons who had been, as nearly as possible,
   eye-witnesses and servants of the Incarnate Word from the beginning.
   While, therefore, except in the cases of Peter, James, John, Andrew,
   and Matthew, we have no particulars in the Gospels respecting the calls
   of those who afterwards became apostles, we must assume that they all
   occurred in the first year of the Saviour's public ministry.

   That these calls were given with conscious reference to an ulterior
   end, even the apostleship, appears from the remarkable terms in which
   the earliest of them was expressed. "Follow Me," said Jesus to the
   fishermen of Bethsaida, "and I will make you fishers of men." These
   words (whose originality stamps them as a genuine saying of Jesus) show
   that the great Founder of the faith desired not only to have disciples,
   but to have about Him men whom He might train to make disciples of
   others: to cast the net of divine truth into the sea of the world, and
   to land on the shores of the divine kingdom a great multitude of
   believing souls. Both from His words and from His actions we can see
   that He attached supreme importance to that part of His work which
   consisted in training the twelve. In the intercessory prayer, [18]
   e.g., He speaks of the training He had given these men as if it had
   been the principal part of His own earthly ministry. And such, in one
   sense, it really was. The careful, painstaking education of the
   disciples secured that the Teacher's influence on the world should be
   permanent; that His kingdom should be founded on the rock of deep and
   indestructible convictions in the minds of the few, not on the shifting
   sands of superficial evanescent impressions on the minds of the many.
   Regarding that kingdom, as our Lord Himself has taught us in one of His
   parables to do, [19] as a thing introduced into the world like a seed
   cast into the ground and left to grow according to natural laws, we may
   say that, but for the twelve, the doctrine, the works, and the image of
   Jesus might have perished from human remembrance, nothing remaining but
   a vague mythical tradition, of no historical value, and of little
   practical influence.

   Those on whom so much depended, it plainly behoved to possess very
   extraordinary qualifications. The mirrors must be finely polished that
   are designed to reflect the image of Christ! The apostles of the
   Christian religion must be men of rare spiritual endowment. It is a
   catholic religion, intended for all nations; therefore its apostles
   must be free from Jewish narrowness, and have sympathies wide as the
   world. It is a spiritual religion, destined ere long to antiquate
   Jewish ceremonialism; therefore its apostles must be emancipated in
   conscience from the yoke of ordinances. [20] It is a religion, once
   more, which is to proclaim the Cross, previously an instrument of
   cruelty and badge of infamy, as the hope of the world's redemption, and
   the symbol of all that is noble and heroic in conduct; therefore its
   heralds must be superior to all conventional notions of human and
   divine dignity, capable of glorying in the cross of Christ, and willing
   to bear a cross themselves. The apostolic character, in short, must
   combine freedom of conscience, enlargement of heart, enlightenment of
   mind, and all in the superlative degree.

   The humble fishermen of Galilee had much to learn before they could
   satisfy these high requirements; so much, that the time of their
   apprenticeship for their apostolic work, even reckoning it from the
   very commencement of Christ's ministry, seems all too short. They were
   indeed godly men, who had already shown the sincerity of their piety by
   forsaking all for their Master's sake. But at the time of their call
   they were exceedingly ignorant, narrow-minded, superstitious, full of
   Jewish prejudices, misconceptions, and animosities. They had much to
   unlearn of what was bad, as well as much to learn of what was good, and
   they were slow both to learn and to unlearn. Old beliefs already in
   possession of their minds made the communication of new religious ideas
   a difficult task. Men of good honest heart, the soil of their spiritual
   nature was fitted to produce an abundant harvest; but it was stiff, and
   needed much laborious tillage before it would yield its fruit. Then,
   once more, they were poor men, of humble birth, low station, mean
   occupations, who had never felt the stimulating influence of a liberal
   education, or of social intercourse with persons of cultivated minds.
   [21]

   We shall meet with abundant evidence of the crude spiritual condition
   of the twelve, even long after the period when they were called to
   follow Jesus, as we proceed with the studies on which we have entered.
   Meantime we may discover significant indications of the religious
   immaturity of at least one of the disciples -- Simon, son of Jonas --
   in Luke's account of the incidents connected with his call. Pressed by
   the multitude who had assembled on the shore of the lake to hear Him
   preach, Jesus, we read, entered into a ship (one of two lying near at
   hand), which happened to be Simon's, and requesting him to thrust out a
   little from the land, sat down, and taught the people from the vessel.
   Having finished speaking, Jesus said unto the owner of the boat,
   "Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught." Their
   previous efforts to catch fish had been unsuccessful; but Simon and his
   brother did as Jesus directed, and were rewarded by an extraordinary
   take, which appeared to them and their fishing companions, James and
   John, nothing short of miraculous. Simon, the most impressible and the
   most demonstrative of the four, gave utterance to his feelings of
   astonishment by characteristic words and gestures. He fell down at
   Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!"

   This exclamation opens a window into the inner man of him who uttered
   it through which we can see his spiritual state. We observe in Peter at
   this time that mixture of good and evil, of grace and nature, which so
   frequently reappears in his character in the subsequent history. Among
   the good elements discernible are reverential awe in presence of Divine
   Power, a prompt calling to mind of sin betraying tenderness of
   conscience, and an unfeigned self-humiliation on account of unmerited
   favor. Valuable features of character these; but they did not exist in
   Peter without alloy. Along with them were associated superstitious
   dread of the supernatural and a slavish fear of God. The presence of
   the former element is implied in the reassuring exhortation addressed
   to the disciple by Jesus, "Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch
   men." Slavish fear of God is even more manifest in his own words,
   "Depart from me, O Lord." Powerfully impressed with the super-human
   knowledge revealed in connection with the great draught of fishes, he
   regards Jesus for the moment as a supernatural being, and as such
   dreads Him as one whom it is not safe to be near, especially for a poor
   sinful mortal like himself. This state of mind shows how utterly unfit
   Peter is, as yet, to be an apostle of a Gospel which magnifies the
   grace of God even to the chief of sinners. His piety, sufficiently
   strong and decided, is not of a Christian type; it is legal, one might
   almost say pagan, in spirit.

   With all their imperfections, which were both numerous and great, these
   humble fishermen of Galilee had, at the very outset of their career,
   one grand distinguishing virtue, which, though it may co-exist with
   many defects, is the cardinal virtue of Christian ethics, and the
   certain forerunner of ultimate high attainment. They were animated by a
   devotion to Jesus and to the divine kingdom which made them capable of
   any sacrifice. Believing Him who bade them follow Him to the Christ,
   come to set up God's kingdom on earth, they "straightway" left their
   nets and joined his company, to be thenceforth His constant companions
   in all His wanderings. The act was acknowledged by Jesus Himself to be
   meritorious; and we cannot, without injustice, seek to disparage it by
   ascribing it to idleness, discontent, or ambition as its motive. The
   Gospel narrative shows that the four brethren were not idle, but
   hard-working, industrious men. Neither were they discontented, if for
   no other reason than that they had no cause for discontent.

   The family of James and John at least seems to have been in
   circumstances of comfort; for Mark relates that, when called by Jesus,
   they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and
   went after Him. But ambition, had it no place among their motives?
   Well, we must admit that the twelve, and especially James and John,
   were by no means free from ambitious passions, as we shall see
   hereafter. But to whatever extent ambition may have influenced their
   conduct at a later period, it was not the motive which determined them
   to leave their nets. Ambition needs a temptation: it does not join a
   cause which is obscure and struggling, and whose success is doubtful;
   it strikes in when success is assured, and when the movement it
   patronizes is on the eve of its glorification. The cause of Jesus had
   not got to that stage yet.

   One charge only can be brought against those men, and it can be brought
   with truth, and without doing their memory any harm. They were
   enthusiasts: their hearts were fired, and, as an unbelieving world
   might say, their heads were turned by a dream about a divine kingdom to
   be set up in Israel, with Jesus of Nazareth for its king. That dream
   possessed them, and imperiously ruled over their minds and shaped their
   destinies, compelling them, like Abraham, to leave their kindred and
   their country, and to go forth on what might well appear beforehand to
   be a fool's errand. Well for the world that they were possessed by the
   idea of the kingdom! For it was no fool's errand on which they went
   forth, leaving their nets behind. The kingdom they sought turned out to
   be as real as the land of Canaan, though not such altogether as they
   had imagined. The fishermen of Galilee did become fishers of men on a
   most extensive scale, and, by the help of God, gathered many souls into
   the church of such as should be saved. In a sense they are casting
   their nets into the sea of the world still, and, by their testimony to
   Jesus in Gospel and Epistle, are bringing multitudes to become
   disciples of Him among whose first followers they had the happiness to
   be numbered.

   The four, the twelve, forsook all and followed their Master. Did the
   "all" in any case include wife and children? It did in at least one
   instance -- that of Peter; for the Gospels tell how Peter's
   mother-in-law was healed of a fever by the miraculous power of Christ.
   [22] From a passage in Paul's first epistle to the Corinthian church,
   it appears that Peter was not the only one among the apostles who was
   married. [23] From the same passage we further learn, that forsaking of
   wives for Christ's sake did not mean literal desertion. Peter the
   apostle led his wife about with him, and Peter the disciple may
   sometimes have done the same. The likelihood is that the married
   disciples, like married soldiers, took their wives with them or left
   them at home, as circumstances might require or admit. Women, even
   married women, did sometimes follow Jesus; and the wife of Simon, or of
   any other married disciple, may occasionally have been among the
   number. At an advanced period in the history we find the mother of
   James and John in Christ's company far from home; and where mothers
   were, wives, if they wished, might also be. The infant church, in its
   original nomadic or itinerant state, seems to have been a motley band
   of pilgrims, in which all sorts of people as to sex, social position,
   and moral character were united, the bond of union being ardent
   attachment to the person of Jesus.

   This church itinerant was not a regularly organized society, of which
   it was necessary to be a constant member in order to true discipleship.
   Except in the case of the twelve, following Jesus from place to place
   was optional, not compulsory; and in most cases it was probably also
   only occasional. [24] It was the natural consequence of faith, when the
   object of faith, the centre of the circle, was Himself in motion.
   Believers would naturally desire to see as many of Christ's works and
   hear as many of His words as possible. When the object of faith left
   the earth, and His presence became spiritual, all occasion for such
   nomadic discipleship was done away. To be present with Him thereafter,
   men needed only to forsake their sins.

   directly intended to bear testimony to the fidelity of the disciples,
   but it bears indirect testimony on the other points also. They had been
   with their Master, if not as a constituted body of twelve, at least as
   individuals, from the time He began to have "temptations," wich was
   very early, and they had been with Him throughout them all.
     __________________________________________________________________

3. MATTHEW THE PUBLICAN

    Matt. 9:9-13; Mark 2:15-17; Luke 5:27-32.

   The call of Matthew signally illustrates a very prominent feature in
   the public action of Jesus, viz., His utter disregard of the maxims of
   worldly wisdom. A publican disciple, much more a publican apostle,
   could not fail to be a stumbling-block to Jewish prejudice, and
   therefore to be, for the time at least, a source of weakness rather
   than of strength. Yet, while perfectly aware of this fact, Jesus
   invited to the intimate fellowship of disciplehood one who had pursued
   the occupation of a tax-gatherer, and at a later period selected him to
   be one of the twelve. His procedure in this case is all the more
   remarkable when contrasted with the manner in which He treated others
   having outward advantages to recommend them to favorable notice, and
   who showed their readiness to follow by volunteering to become
   disciples; of whom we have a sample in the scribe who came and said,
   "Master, I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou goest." [25] This man,
   whose social position and professional attainments seemed to point him
   out as a very desirable acquisition, the "Master" deliberately scared
   away by a gloomy picture of his own destitute condition, saying, "The
   foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, [26] but the Son
   of man hath not where to lay His head."

   The eye of Jesus was single as well as omniscient: He looked on the
   heart, and had respect solely to spiritual fitness. He had no faith in
   any discipleship based on misapprehensions and by-ends; and, on the
   other hand, He had no fear of the drawbacks arising out of the external
   connections or past history of true believers, but was entirely
   indifferent to men's antecedents. Confident in the power of truth, He
   chose the base things of the world in preference to things held in
   esteem, assured that they would conquer at the last. Aware that both He
   and His disciples would be despised and rejected of men for a season,
   He went calmly on His way, choosing for His companions and agents "whom
   He would," undisturbed by the gainsaying of His generation -- like one
   who knew that His work concerned all nations and all time.

   The publican disciple bears two names in the Gospel history. In the
   first Gospel he is called Matthew, while in the second and third
   Gospels he is called Levi. That the same person is intended, may, we
   think, be regarded as a matter of certainty. [27] It is hardly
   conceivable that two publicans should have been called to be disciples
   at the same place and time, and with all accompanying circumstances,
   and these so remarkable, precisely similar. We need not be surprised
   that the identity has not been notified, as the fact of the two names
   belonging to one individual would be so familiar to the first readers
   of the Gospels as to make such a piece of information superfluous.

   It is not improbable that Levi was the name of this disciple before the
   time of his call, and that Matthew was his name as a disciple, -- the
   new name thus becoming a symbol and memorial of the more important
   change in heart and life. Similar emblematic changes of name were of
   frequent occurrence in the beginning of the Gospel. Simon son of Jonas
   was transformed into Peter, Saul of Tarsus became Paul, and Joses the
   Cypriot got from the apostles the beautiful Christian name of Barnabas
   (son of consolation or prophecy), by his philanthropy, and magnanimity,
   and spiritual wisdom, well deserved.

   Matthew seems to have been employed as a collector of revenue, at the
   time when he was called, in the town of Capernaum, which Jesus had
   adopted as His place of abode. For it was while Jesus was at home "in
   His own city," [28] as Capernaum came to be called, that the palsied
   man was brought to Him to be healed; and from all the evangelists [29]
   we learn that it was on His way out from the house where that miracle
   was wrought that He saw Matthew, and spoke to him the word, "Follow
   Me." The inference to be drawn from these facts is plain, and it is
   also important, as helping to explain the apparent abruptness of the
   call, and the promptitude with which it was responded to. Jesus and His
   new disciple being fellow-townsmen, had opportunities of seeing each
   other before.

   The time of Matthew's call cannot be precisely determined, but there is
   good reason for placing it before the Sermon on the Mount, of which
   Matthew's Gospel contains the most complete report. The fact just
   stated is of itself strong evidence in favor of this chronological
   arrangement, for so full an account of the sermon was not likely to
   emanate from one who did not hear it. An examination of the third
   Gospel converts probability into something like certainty. Luke
   prefixes to his abbreviated account of the sermon a notice of the
   constitution of the apostolic society, and represents Jesus as
   proceeding "with them" [30] -- the twelve, whose names he has just
   given -- to the scene where the sermon was delivered. Of course the act
   of constitution must have been preceded by the separate acts of
   calling, and by Matthew's call in particular, which accordingly is
   related by the third evangelist in an earlier part of his Gospel. [31]
   It is true the position of the call in Luke's narrative in itself
   proves nothing, as Matthew relates his own call after the sermon; and
   as, moreover, neither one nor other systematically adheres to the
   chronological principle of arrangement in the construction of his
   story. We base our conclusion on the assumption, that when any of the
   evangelists professes to give the order of sequence, his statement may
   be relied on; and on the observations, that Luke does manifestly commit
   himself to a chronological datum in making the ordination of the twelve
   antecedent to the preaching of the Sermon on the Mount, and that
   Matthew's arrangement in the early part of his Gospel is as manifestly
   unchronological, his matter being massed on the topical principle, ch.
   v.-vii. showing Jesus as a great ethical teacher; ch. viii. and ix., as
   a worker of miracles; ch. x., as a master, choosing, instructing, and
   sending forth on an evangelistic mission the twelve disciples; ch. xi.,
   as a critic of His contemporaries and assertor of His own prerogatives;
   ch. xii., as exposed to the contradictions of unbelief; and ch. xiii.,
   as teaching the doctrines of the kingdom by parables.

   Passing from these subordinate points to the call itself, we observe
   that the narratives of the event are very brief and fragmentary. There
   is no intimation of any previous acquaintance such as might prepare
   Matthew to comply with the invitation addressed to him by Jesus. It is
   not to be inferred, however, that no such acquaintance existed, as we
   can see from the case of the four fishermen, whose call is narrated
   with equal abruptness in the synoptical Gospels, while we know from
   John's Gospel that three of them at least were previously acquainted
   with Jesus. The truth is, that, in regard to both calls, the
   evangelists concerned themselves only about the crisis, passing over in
   silence all preparatory stages, and not deeming it necessary to inform
   intelligent readers that, of course, neither the publican nor any other
   disciple blindly followed one of whom he knew nothing merely because
   asked or commanded to follow. The fact already ascertained, that
   Matthew, while a publican, resided in Capernaum, makes it absolutely
   certain that he knew of Jesus before he was called. No man could live
   in that town in those days without hearing of "mighty works" done in
   and around it. Heaven had been opened right above Capernaum, in view of
   all, and the angels had been thronging down upon the Son of man. Lepers
   were cleansed, and demoniacs dispossessed; blind men received their
   sight, and palsied men the use of their limbs; one woman was cured of a
   chronic malady, and another, daughter of a distinguished citizen, --
   Jairus, ruler of the synagogue, -- was brought back to life from the
   dead. These things were done publicly, made a great noise, and were
   much remarked on. The evangelists relate how the people "were all
   amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What
   thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth
   He even the unclean spirits, and they do obey Him;." [32] how they
   glorified God, saying, "We never saw it on this fashion," [33] or, "we
   have seen strange things today." [34] Matthew himself concludes his
   account of the raising of Jairus' daughter with the remark: "The fame
   hereof went abroad into all that land." [35]

   We do not affirm that all these miracles were wrought before the time
   of the publican's call, but some of them certainly were. Comparing one
   Gospel with another, to determine the historical sequence, [36] we
   conclude that the greatest of all these mighty works, the last
   mentioned, though narrated by Matthew after his call, really occurred
   before it. Think, then, what a powerful effect that marvelous deed
   would have in preparing the tax-gatherer for recognizing, in the
   solemnly uttered word, "Follow me," the command of One who was Lord
   both of the dead and of the living, and for yielding to His bidding,
   prompt, unhesitating obedience!

   In crediting Matthew with some previous knowledge of Christ, we make
   his conversion to discipleship appear reasonable without diminishing
   its moral value. It was not a matter of course that he should become a
   follower of Jesus merely because he had heard of, or even seen, His
   wonderful works. Miracles of themselves could make no man a believer,
   otherwise all the people of Capernaum should have believed. How
   different was the actual fact, we learn from the complaints afterwards
   made by Jesus concerning those towns along the shores of the Lake of
   Gennesareth, wherein most of His mighty works were done, and of
   Capernaum in particular. Of this city He said bitterly: "Thou,
   Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto
   Hades: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been
   done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. [37] Christ's
   complaint against the inhabitants of these favored cities was that they
   did not repent, that is, make the kingdom of heaven their chief good
   and chief end. They wondered sufficiently at His miracles, and talked
   abundantly of them, and ran after Him to see more works of the same
   kind, and enjoy anew the sensation of amazement; but after a while they
   relapsed into their old stupidity and listlessness, and remained
   morally as they had been before He came among them, not children of the
   kingdom, but children of this world.

   It was not so with the collector of customs. He not merely wondered and
   talked, but he "repented." Whether he had more to repent of than his
   neighbors, we cannot tell. It is true that he belonged to a class of
   men who, seen through the colored medium of popular prejudice, were all
   bad alike, and many of whom were really guilty of fraud and extortion;
   but he may have been an exception. His farewell feast shows that he
   possessed means, but we must not take for granted that they were
   dishonestly earned. This only we may safely say, that if the publican
   disciple had been covetous, the spirit of greed was now exorcised; if
   he had ever been guilty of oppressing the poor, he now abhorred such
   work. He had grown weary of collecting revenue from a reluctant
   population, and was glad to follow One who had come to take burdens off
   instead of laying them on, to remit debts instead of exacting them with
   rigor. And so it came to pass that the voice of Jesus acted on his
   heart like a spell: "He left all, rose up, and followed Him."

   This great decision, according to the account of all the evangelists,
   was followed shortly after by a feast in Matthew's house at which Jesus
   was present. [38] From Luke we learn that this entertainment had all
   the character of a great occasion, and that it was given in honor of
   Jesus. The honor, however, was such as few would value, for the other
   guests were peculiar. "There was a great company of publicans, and of
   others that sat down with them;." [39] and among the "others" were some
   who either were or were esteemed, in a superlative degree, "sinners."
   [40]

   This feast was, as we judge, not less rich in moral significance than
   in the viands set on the board. For the host himself it was, without
   doubt, a jubilee feast commemorative of his emancipation from drudgery
   and uncongenial society and sin, or, at all events. temptation to sin,
   and of his entrance on the free, blessed life of fellowship with Jesus.
   It was a kind of poem, saying for Matthew what Doddridge's familiar
   lines say for many another, perhaps not so well --


   "Oh happy day, that fixed my choice

   On Thee, my Saviour, and my God!

   Well may this glowing heart rejoice,

   And tell its raptures all abroad!


   'Tis done; the great transaction's done;

   I am my Lord's and He is mine;

   He drew me, and I followed on,

   Charmed to confess the voice divine."

   The feast was also, as already said, an act of homage to Jesus. Matthew
   made his splendid feast in honor of his new master, as Mary of Bethany
   shed her precious ointment. It is the way of those to whom much grace
   is shown and given, to manifest their grateful love in deeds bearing
   the stamp of what a Greek philosopher called magnificence, [41] and
   churls call extravagance; and whoever might blame such acts of
   devotion, Jesus always accepted them with pleasure.

   The ex-publican's feast seems further to have had the character of a
   farewell entertainment to his fellow-publicans. He and they were to go
   different ways henceforth, and he would part with his old comrades in
   peace.

   Once more: we can believe that Matthew meant his feast to be the means
   of introducing his friends and neighbors to the acquaintance of Jesus,
   seeking with the characteristic zeal of a young disciple to induce
   others to take the step which he had resolved on himself, or at least
   hoping that some sinners present might be drawn from evil ways into the
   paths of righteousness. And who can tell but it was at this very
   festive gathering, or on some similar occasion, that the gracious
   impressions were produced whose final outcome was that affecting
   display of gratitude unutterable at that other feast in Simon's house,
   to which neither publicans nor sinners were admitted?

   Matthew's feast was thus, looked at from within, a very joyous,
   innocent, and even edifying one. But, alas! looked at from without,
   like stained windows, it wore a different aspect: it was, indeed,
   nothing short of scandalous. Certain Pharisees observed the company
   assemble or disperse, noted their character, and made, after their
   wont, sinister reflections. Opportunity offering itself, they asked the
   disciples of Jesus the at once complimentary and censorious question:
   "Why eateth your master with publicans and sinners?" The interrogants
   were for the most part local members of the pharisaic sect, for Luke
   calls them "their scribes and Pharisees," [42] which implies that
   Capernaum was important enough to be honored with the presence of men
   representing that religious party. It is by no means unlikely, however,
   that among the unfriendly spectators were some Pharisees all the way
   from Jerusalem, the seat of ecclesiastical government, already on the
   track of the Prophet of Nazareth, watching His doings, as they watched
   those of the Baptist before Him. The news of Christ's wondrous works
   soon spread over all the land, and attracted spectators from all
   quarters -- from Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and Persia, as well as
   Galilee: [43] and we may be sure that the scribes and Pharisees of the
   holy city were not the last to go and see, for we must own they
   performed the duty of religious espionage with exemplary diligence.

   The presence of ill-affected men belonging to the pharisaic order was
   almost a standing feature in Christ's public ministry. But it never
   disconcerted Him. He went calmly on His way doing His work; and when
   His conduct was called in question, He was ever ready with a conclusive
   answer. Among the most striking of His answers or apologies to them who
   examined Him, were those in which He vindicated Himself for mixing with
   publicans and sinners. They are three in number, spoken on as many
   occasions: the first in connection with Matthew's feast; the second in
   the house of Simon the Pharisee; [44] and the third on an occasion not
   minutely defined, when certain scribes and Pharisees brought against
   Him the grave charge, "This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with
   them." [45] These apologies for loving the unloved and the morally
   unlovely are full of truth and grace, poetry and pathos, and not
   without a touch of quiet, quaint satire directed against the
   sanctimonious fault-finders. The first may be distinguished as the
   professional argument, and is to this effect: "I frequent the haunts of
   sinners, because I am a physician, and they are sick and need healing.
   Where should a physician be but among his patients? where oftenest, but
   among those most grievously afflicted?" The second may be described as
   the political argument, its drift being this: "It is good policy to be
   the friend of sinners who have much to be forgiven; for when they are
   restored to the paths of virtue and piety, how great is their love! See
   that penitent woman, weeping for sorrow and also for joy, and bathing
   her Saviour's feet with her tears. Those tears are refreshing to my
   heart, as a spring of water in the arid desert of pharisaic frigidity
   and formalism." The third may be denominated the argument from natural
   instinct, and runs thus: "I receive sinners, and eat with them, and
   seek by these means their moral restoration, for the same reason which
   moves the shepherd to go after a lost sheep, leaving his unstrayed
   flock in the wilderness, viz. because it is natural to seek the lost,
   and to have more joy in finding things lost than in possessing things
   which never have been lost. Men who understand not this feeling are
   solitary in the universe; for angels in heaven, fathers, housewives,
   shepherds, all who have human hearts on earth, understand it well, and
   act on it every day."

   In all these reasonings Jesus argued with His accusers on their own
   premises, accepting their estimate of themselves, and of the class with
   whom they deemed it discreditable to associate, as righteous and sinful
   respectively. But He took care, at the same time, to let it appear that
   His judgment concerning the two parties did not coincide with that of
   His interrogators. This He did on the occasion of Matthew's feast, by
   bidding them go study the text, "I will have mercy, and not
   sacrifice;." meaning by the quotation to insinuate, that while very
   religious, the Pharisees were also very inhuman, full of pride,
   prejudice, harshness, and hatred; and to proclaim the truth, that this
   character was in God's sight far more detestable than that of those who
   were addicted to the coarse vices of the multitude, not to speak of
   those who were "sinners" mainly in the pharisaic imagination, and
   within inverted commas.

   Our Lord's last words to the persons who called His conduct in question
   at this time were not merely apologetic, but judicial. "I came not," He
   said, "to call the righteous, but sinners;." [46] intimating a purpose
   to let the self-righteous alone and to call to repentance and to the
   joys of the kingdom those who were not too self-satisfied to care for
   the benefits offered, and to whom the gospel feast would be a real
   entertainment. The word, in truth, contained a significant hint of an
   approaching religious revolution in which the last should become first
   and the first last; Jewish outcasts, Gentile dogs, made partakers of
   the joys of the kingdom and the "righteous" shut out. It was one of the
   pregnant sayings by which Jesus made known to those who could
   understand, that His religion was an universal one, a religion for
   humanity, a gospel for mankind, because a gospel for sinners. And what
   this saying declared in word, the conduct it apologized for proclaimed
   yet more expressively by deed. It was an ominous thing that loving
   sympathy for "publicans and sinners" -- the pharisaic instinct
   discerned it to be so, and rightly took the alarm. It meant death to
   privileged monopolies of grace and to Jewish pride and exclusivism --
   all men equal in God's sight, and welcome to salvation on the same
   terms. In fact it was a virtual announcement of the Pauline programme
   of an universalistic gospel, which the twelve are supposed by a certain
   school of theologians to have opposed as determinedly as the Pharisees
   themselves. Strange that the men who had been with Jesus were so obtuse
   as not to understand, even at the last, what was involved in their
   Master's fellowship with the low and the lost! Was Buddha more
   fortunate in his disciples than Jesus in His? Buddha said, "My law is a
   law of grace for all," directing the saying immediately against
   Brahminical caste prejudice; and his followers understood that it
   meant, Buddhism a missionary religion, a religion even for Sudras, and
   therefore for all mankind!

4. THE TWELVE

    Matt. 10:1-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16; Acts 1:13.

   The selection by Jesus of the twelve from the band of disciples who had
   gradually gathered around His person is an important landmark in the
   Gospel history. It divides the ministry of our Lord into two portions,
   nearly equal, probably, as to duration, but unequal as to the extent
   and importance of the work done in each respectively. In the earlier
   period Jesus labored single-handed; His miraculous deeds were confined
   for the most part to a limited area, and His teaching was in the main
   of an elementary character. But by the time when the twelve were
   chosen, the work of the kingdom had assumed such dimensions as to
   require organization and division of labor; and the teaching of Jesus
   was beginning to be of a deeper and more elaborate nature, and His
   gracious activities were taking on ever-widening range.

   It is probable that the selection of a limited number to be His close
   and constant companions had become a necessity to Christ, in
   consequence of His very success in gaining disciples. His followers, we
   imagine, had grown so numerous as to be an incumbrance and an
   impediment to his movements, especially in the long journeys which mark
   the later part of His ministry. It was impossible that all who believed
   could continue henceforth to follow Him, in the literal sense,
   whithersoever He might go: the greater number could now only be
   occasional followers. But it was His wish that certain selected men
   should be with Him at all times and in all places, -- His travelling
   companions in all His wanderings, witnessing all His work, and
   ministering to His daily needs. And so, in the quaint words of Mark,
   "Jesus calleth unto Him whom He would, and they came unto Him, and He
   made twelve, that they should be with Him." [47]

   These twelve, however, as we know, were to be something more than
   travelling companions or menial servants of the Lord Jesus Christ. They
   were to be, in the mean time, students of Christian doctrine, and
   occasional fellow-laborers in the work of the kingdom, and eventually
   Christ's chosen trained agents for propagating the faith after He
   Himself had left the earth. From the time of their being chosen,
   indeed, the twelve entered on a regular apprenticeship for the great
   office of apostleship, in the course of which they were to learn, in
   the privacy of an intimate daily fellowship with their Master, what
   they should be, do, believe, and teach, as His witnesses and
   ambassadors to the world. Henceforth the training of these men was to
   be a constant and prominent part of Christ's personal work. He was to
   make it His business to tell them in darkness what they should
   afterwards speak in the daylight, and to whisper in their ear what in
   after years they should preach upon the housetops. [48]

   The time when this election was made, though not absolutely determined,
   is fixed in relation to certain leading events in the Gospel history.
   John speaks of the twelve as an organized company at the period of the
   feeding of the five thousand, and of the discourse on the bread of life
   in the synagogue of Capernaum, delivered shortly after that miracle.
   From this fact we learn that the twelve were chosen at least one year
   before the crucifixion; for the miracle of the feeding took place,
   according to the fourth evangelist, shortly before a Passover season.
   [49] From the words spoken by Jesus to the men whom He had chosen, in
   justification of His seeming doubt of their fidelity after the
   multitude had deserted Him, "Did I not choose you the twelve, and one
   of you is a devil?" [50] we conclude that the choice was then not quite
   a recent event. The twelve had been long enough together to give the
   false disciple opportunity to show his real character.

   Turning now to the synoptical evangelists, we find them fixing the
   position of the election with reference to two other most important
   events. Matthew speaks for the first time of the twelve as a distinct
   body in connection with their mission in Galilee. He does not, however,
   say that they were chosen immediately before, and with direct reference
   to, that mission. He speaks rather as if the apostolic fraternity had
   been previously in existence, his words being, "When He had called unto
   Him His twelve disciples." Luke, on the other hand, gives a formal
   record of the election, as a preface to his account of the Sermon on
   the Mount, so speaking as to create the impression that the one event
   immediately preceded the other. [51] Finally, Mark's narrative confirms
   the view suggested by these observations on Matthew and Luke, viz. that
   the twelve were called just before the Sermon the Mount was delivered,
   and some considerable time before they were sent forth on their
   preaching and healing mission. There we read: "Jesus goeth up into the
   mountain (to oros), [52] and calleth unto Him whom He would" -- the
   ascent referred to evidently being that which Jesus made just before
   preaching His great discourse. Mark continues: "And He ordained twelve,
   that they should be with Him, and that He might send them forth to
   preach, and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils."
   Here allusion is made to an intention on Christ's part to send forth
   His disciples on a mission, but the intention is not represented as
   immediately realized. Nor can it be said that immediate realization is
   implied, though not expressed; for the evangelist gives an account of
   the mission as actually carried out several chapters further on in his
   Gospel, commencing with the words, "And He calleth unto Him the twelve,
   and began to send them forth." [53]

   It may be regarded, then, as tolerably certain, that the calling of the
   twelve was a prelude to the preaching of the great sermon on the
   kingdom, in the founding of which they were afterwards to take so
   distinguished a part. At what precise period in the ministry of our
   Lord the sermon itself is to be placed, we cannot so confidently
   determine. Our opinion, however, is, that the Sermon on the Mount was
   delivered towards the close of Christ's first lengthened ministry in
   Galilee, during the time which intervened between the two visits to
   Jerusalem on festive occasions mentioned in the second and fifth
   chapters of John's Gospel. [54]

   The number of the apostolic company is significant, and was doubtless a
   matter of choice, not less than was the composition of the selected
   band. A larger number of eligible men could easily have been found in a
   circle of disciples which afterwards supplied not fewer than seventy
   auxiliaries for evangelistic work; [55] and a smaller number might have
   served all the present or prospective purposes of the apostleship. The
   number twelve was recommended by obvious symbolic reasons. It happily
   expressed in figures what Jesus claimed to be, and what He had come to
   do, and thus furnished a support to the faith and a stimulus to the
   devotion of His followers. It significantly hinted that Jesus was the
   divine Messianic King of Israel, come to set up the kingdom whose
   advent was foretold by prophets in glowing language, suggested by the
   palmy days of Israel's history, when the theocratic community existed
   in its integrity, and all the tribes of the chosen nation were united
   under the royal house of David. That the number twelve was designed to
   bear such a mystic meaning, we know from Christ's own words to the
   apostles on a later occasion, when, describing to them the rewards
   awaiting them in the kingdom for past services and sacrifices, He said,
   "Verily I say unto you, that ye which have followed me, in the
   regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory,
   ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
   Israel." [56]

   It is possible that the apostles were only too well aware of the mystic
   significance of their number, and found in it an encouragement to the
   fond delusive hope that the coming kingdom should be not only a
   spiritual realization of the promises, but a literal restoration of
   Israel to political integrity and independence. The risk of such
   misapprehension was one of the drawbacks connected with the particular
   number twelve, but it was not deemed by Jesus a sufficient reason for
   fixing on another. His method of procedure in this, as in all things,
   was to abide by that which in itself was true and right, and then to
   correct misapprehensions as they arose.

   From the number of the apostolic band, we pass to the persons composing
   it. Seven of the twelve -- the first seven in the catalogues of Mark
   and Luke, assuming the identity of Bartholomew and Nathanael -- are
   persons already known to us. With two of the remaining five -- the
   first and the last -- we shall become well acquainted as we proceed in
   the history. Thomas called Didymus, or the Twin, will come before us as
   a man of warm heart but melancholy temperament, ready to die with his
   Lord, but slow to believe in His resurrection. Judas Iscariot is known
   to all the world as the Traitor. He appears for the first time, in
   these catalogues of the apostles, with the infamous title branded on
   his brow, "Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him." The presence of a
   man capable of treachery among the elect disciples is a mystery which
   we shall not now attempt to penetrate. We merely make this historical
   remark about Judas here, that he seems to have been the only one among
   the twelve who was not a Galilean. He is surnamed, from his native
   place apparently, the man of Kerioth; and from the Book of Joshua we
   learn that there was a town of that name in the southern border of the
   tribe of Judah. [57]

   The three names which remain are exceedingly obscure. On grounds
   familiar to Bible scholars, it has often been attempted to identify
   James of AlphÃ¦us with James the brother or kinsman of the Lord. The
   next on the lists of Matthew and Mark has been supposed by many to have
   been a brother of this James, and therefore another brother of Jesus.
   This opinion is based on the fact, that in place of the LebbÃ¦us or
   ThaddÃ¦us of the two first Gospels, we find in Luke's catalogues the
   name Judas "of James." The ellipsis in this designation has been filled
   up with the word brother, and it is assumed that the James alluded to
   is James the son of AlphÃ¦us. However tempting these results may be, we
   can scarcely regard them as ascertained, and must content ourselves
   with stating that among the twelve was a second James, besides the
   brother of John and son of Zebedee, and also a second Judas, who
   appears again as an interlocutor in the farewell conversation between
   Jesus and His disciples on the night before His crucifixion, carefully
   distinguished by the evangelist from the traitor by the parenthetical
   remark "not Iscariot." [58] This Judas, being the same with LebbÃ¦us
   ThaddÃ¦us, has been called the three-named disciple. [59]

   The disciple whom we have reserved to the last place, like the one who
   stands at the head of all the lists, was a Simon. This second Simon is
   as obscure as the first is celebrated, for he is nowhere mentioned in
   the Gospel history, except in the catalogues; yet, little known as he
   is, the epithet attached to his name conveys a piece of curious and
   interesting information. He is called the Kananite (not Canaanite),
   which is a political, not a geographical designation, as appears from
   the Greek work substituted in the place of this Hebrew one by Luke, who
   calls the disciple we now speak of Simon Zelotes; that is, in English,
   Simon the Zealot. This epithet Zelotes connects Simon unmistakably with
   the famous party which rose in rebellion under Judas in the days of the
   taxing, [60] some twenty years before Christ's ministry began, when
   Judea and Samaria were brought under the direct government of Rome, and
   the census of the population was taken with a view to subsequent
   taxation. How singular a phenomenon is this ex-zealot among the
   disciples of Jesus! No two men could differ more widely in their
   spirit, ends, and means, than Judas of Galilee and Jesus of Nazareth.
   The one was a political malcontent; the other would have the conquered
   bow to the yoke, and give to CÃ¦sar CÃ¦sar's due. The former aimed at
   restoring the kingdom to Israel, adopting for his watchword, "We have
   no Lord or Master but God;." the latter aimed at founding a kingdom not
   national, but universal, not "of this world," but purely spiritual. The
   means employed by the two actors were as diverse as their ends. One had
   recourse to the carnal weapons of war, the sword and the dagger; the
   other relied solely on the gentle but omnipotent force of truth.

   What led Simon to leave Judas for Jesus we know not; but he made a
   happy exchange for himself, as the party he forsook were destined in
   after years to bring ruin on themselves and on their country by their
   fanatical, reckless, and unavailing patriotism. Though the insurrection
   of Judas was crushed, the fire of discontent still smouldered in the
   breasts of his adherents; and at length it burst out into the blaze of
   a new rebellion, which brought on a death-struggle with the gigantic
   power of Rome, and ended in the destruction of the Jewish capital, and
   the dispersion of the Jewish people.

   The choice of this disciple to be an apostle supplies another
   illustration of Christ's disregard of prudential wisdom. An ex-zealot
   was not a safe man to make an apostle of, for he might be the means of
   rendering Jesus and His followers objects of political suspicion. But
   the Author of our faith was willing to take the risk. He expected to
   gain many disciples from the dangerous classes as well as from the
   despised, and He would have them, too, represented among the twelve.

   It gives one a pleasant surprise to think of Simon the zealot and
   Matthew the publican, men coming from so opposite quarters, meeting
   together in close fellowship in the little band of twelve. In the
   persons of these two disciples extremes meet -- the tax-gatherer and
   the tax-hater: the unpatriotic Jew, who degraded himself by becoming a
   servant of the alien ruler; and the Jewish patriot, who chafed under
   the foreign yoke, and sighed for emancipation. This union of opposites
   was not accidental, but was designed by Jesus as a prophecy of the
   future. He wished the twelve to be the church in miniature or germ; and
   therefore He chose them so as to intimate that, as among them
   distinctions of publican and zealot were unknown, so in the church of
   the future there should be neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
   uncircumcision, bond nor free, but only Christ -- all to each, and in
   each of the all.

   These were the names of the twelve as given in the catalogues. As to
   the order in which they are arranged, on closely inspecting the lists
   we observe that they contain three groups of four, in each of which the
   same names are always found, though the order of arrangement varies.
   The first group includes those best known, the second the next best,
   and the third those least known of all, or, in the case of the traitor,
   known only too well. Peter, the most prominent character among the
   twelve, stands at the head of all the lists, and Judas Iscariot at the
   foot, carefully designated, as already observed, the traitor. The
   apostolic roll, taking the order given in Matthew, and borrowing
   characteristic epithets from the Gospel history at large, is as
   follows: --

   FIRST GROUP
   Simon Peter The man of rock.
   Andrew Peter's brother.
   James and } { Sons of Zebedee, and sons of thunder.
   John
   SECOND GROUP
   Philip The earnest inquirer.
   Bartholomew, or Nathanael The guileless Israelite.
   Thomas     The melancholy.
   John     The publican (so called) by himself only.
   THIRD GROUP
   James (the son) of AlphÃ¦us     (James the Less? Mark xv. 40.).
   LebbÃ¦us, ThaddÃ¦us, Judas of James,     The three-named disciple.
   Simon     The Zealot.
   Judas, the man of Kerioth     The Traitor.

   Such were the men whom Jesus chose to be with Him while He was on this
   earth, and to carry on His work after He left it. Such were the men
   whom the church celebrates as the "glorious company of the apostles."
   The praise is merited; but the glory of the twelve was not of this
   world. In a worldly point of view they were a very insignificant
   company indeed, -- a band of poor illiterate Galilean provincials,
   utterly devoid of social consequence, not likely to be chosen by one
   having supreme regard to prudential considerations. Why did Jesus
   choose such men? Was He guided by feelings of antagonism to those
   possessing social advantages, or of partiality for men of His own
   class? No; His choice was made in true wisdom. If He chose Galileans
   mainly, it was not from provincial prejudice against those of the
   south; if, as some think, He chose two or even four [61] of his own
   kindred, it was not from nepotism; if He chose rude, unlearned, humble
   men, it was not because He was animated by any petty jealousy of
   knowledge, culture, or good birth. If any rabbi, rich man, or ruler had
   been willing to yield himself unreservedly to the service of the
   kingdom, no objection would have been taken to him on account of his
   acquirements, possessions, or titles. The case of Saul of Tarsus, the
   pupil of Gamaliel, proves the truth of this statement. Even Gamaliel
   himself would not have been objected to, could he have stooped to
   become a disciple of the unlearned Nazarene. But, alas! neither he nor
   any of his order would condescend so far, and therefore the despised
   One did not get an opportunity of showing His willingness to accept as
   disciples and choose for apostles such as they were.

   The truth is, that Jesus was obliged to be content with fishermen, and
   publicans, and quondam zealots, for apostles. They were the best that
   could be had. Those who deemed themselves better were too proud to
   become disciples, and thereby they excluded themselves from what all
   the world now sees to be the high honor of being the chosen princes of
   the kingdom. The civil and religious aristocracy boasted of their
   unbelief. [62] The citizens of Jerusalem did feel for a moment
   interested in the zealous youth who had purged the temple with a whip
   of small cords; but their faith was superficial, and their attitude
   patronizing, and therefore Jesus did not commit Himself unto them,
   because He knew what was in them. [63] A few of good position were
   sincere sympathizers, but they were not so decided in their attachment
   as to be eligible for apostles. Nicodemus was barely able to speak a
   timid apologetic word in Christ's behalf, and Joseph of Arimathea was a
   disciple "secretly," for fear of the Jews. These were hardly the
   persons to send forth as missionaries of the cross -- men so fettered
   by social ties and party connections, and so enslaved by the fear of
   man. The apostles of Christianity must be made of sterner stuff.

   And so Jesus was obliged to fall back on the rustic, but simple,
   sincere, and energetic men of Galilee. And He was quite content with
   His choice, and devoutly thanked His Father for giving Him even such as
   they. Learning, rank, wealth, refinement, freely given up to his
   service, He would not have despised; but He preferred devoted men who
   had none of these advantages to undevoted men who had them all. And
   with good reason; for it mattered little, except in the eyes of
   contemporary prejudice, what the social position or even the previous
   history of the twelve had been, provided they were spiritually
   qualified for the work to which they were called. What tells ultimately
   is, not what is without a man, but what is within. John Bunyan was a
   man of low birth, low occupation, and, up till his conversion, of low
   habits; but he was by nature a man of genius, and by grace a man of
   God, and he would have made -- he was, in fact -- a most effective
   apostle.

   But it may be objected that all the twelve were by no means gifted like
   Bunyan; some of them, if one may judge from the obscurity which
   envelops their names, and the silence of history regarding them, having
   been undistinguished either by high endowment or by a great career, and
   in fact, to speak plainly, all but useless. As this objection virtually
   impugns the wisdom of Christ's choice, it is necessary to examine how
   far it is according to truth. [64] We submit the following
   considerations with this view: --

   I. That some of the apostles were comparatively obscure, inferior men,
   cannot be denied; but even the obscurest of them may have been most
   useful as witnesses for Him with whom they had companied from the
   beginning. It does not take a great man to make a good witness, and to
   be witnesses of Christian facts was the main business of the apostles.
   That even the humblest of them rendered important service in that
   capacity we need not doubt, though nothing is said of them in the
   apostolic annals. It was not to be expected that a history so
   fragmentary and so brief as that given by Luke should mention any but
   the principal actors, especially when we reflect how few of the
   characters that appear on the stage at any particular crisis in human
   affairs are prominently noticed even in histories which go elaborately
   into detail. The purpose of history is served by recording the words
   and deeds of the representative men, and many are allowed to drop into
   oblivion who did nobly in their day. The less distinguished members of
   the apostolic band are entitled to the benefit of this reflection.

   2. Three eminent men, or even two (Peter and John), out of twelve, is a
   good proportion; there being few societies in which superior excellence
   bears such a high ratio to respectable mediocrity. Perhaps the number
   of "Pillars" [65] was as great as was desirable. Far from regretting
   that all were not Peters and Johns, it is rather a matter to be
   thankful for, that there were diversities of gifts among the first
   preachers of the gospel. As a general rule, it is not good when all are
   leaders. Little men are needed as well as great men; for human nature
   is one-sided, and little men have their peculiar virtues and gifts, and
   can do some things better than their more celebrated brethren.

   3. We must remember how little we know concerning any of the apostles.
   It is the fashion of biographers in our day, writing for a morbidly or
   idly curious public, to enter into the minutest particulars of outward
   event or personal peculiarity regarding their heroes. Of this fond
   idolatrous minuteness there is no trace in the evangelic histories. The
   writers of the Gospels were not afflicted with the biographic mania.
   Moreover, the apostles were not their theme. Christ was their hero; and
   their sole desire was to tell what they knew of Him. They gazed
   steadfastly at the Sun of Righteousness, and in His effulgence they
   lost sight of the attendant stars. Whether they were stars of the first
   magnitude, or of the second, or of the third, made little difference.

5. HEARING AND SEEING

    Luke 1:1-4; Matt. 13:16-17; Luke 10:23, 24; Matt. 5-7; Luke 6:17-49; Matt.
    13:1-52; Matt. 8:16, 17; Mark 4:33, 34.

   In the training of the twelve for the work of the apostleship, hearing
   and seeing the words and works of Christ necessarily occupied an
   important place. Eye and ear witnessing of the facts of an unparalleled
   life was an indispensable preparation for future witness-bearing. The
   apostles could secure credence for their wondrous tale only by being
   able to preface it with the protestation: "That which we have seen and
   heard declare we unto you." None would believe their report, save those
   who, at the very least, were satisfied that it emanated from men who
   had been with Jesus. Hence the third evangelist, himself not an
   apostle, but only a companion of apostles, presents his Gospel with all
   confidence to his friend Theophilus as a genuine history, and no mere
   collection of fables, because its contents were attested by men who
   "from the beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word."

   In the early period of their discipleship hearing and seeing seem to
   have been the main occupation of the twelve. They were then like
   children born into a new world, whose first and by no means least
   important course of lessons consists in the use of their senses in
   observing the wonderful objects by which they are surrounded.

   The things which the twelve saw and heard were wonderful enough. The
   great Actor in the stupendous drama was careful to impress on His
   followers the magnitude of their privilege. "Blessed," said He to them
   on one occasion, "are the eyes which see the things that ye see: for I
   tell you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which
   ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and
   heard them not." [66] Yet certain generations of Israel had seen very
   remarkable things: one had seen the wonders of the Exodus, and the
   sublimities connected with the lawgiving at Sinai; another, the
   miracles wrought by Elijah and Elisha; and successive generations had
   been privileged to listen to the not less wonderful oracles of God,
   spoken by David, Solomon, Isaiah, and the rest of the prophets. But the
   things witnessed by the twelve eclipsed the wonders of all bygone ages;
   for a greater than Moses, or Elijah, or David, or Solomon, or Isaiah,
   was here, and the promise to Nathanael was being fulfilled. Heaven had
   been opened, and the angels of God -- the spirits of wisdom, and power,
   and love -- were ascending and descending on the Son of man.

   We may here take a rapid survey of the mirabilia which it was the
   peculiar privilege of the twelve to see and hear, more or less during
   the whole period of their discipleship, and specially just after their
   election. These may be comprehended under two heads: the Doctrine of
   the Kingdom, and the Philanthropic Work of the Kingdom.

   I. Before the ministry of Jesus commenced, His forerunner had appeared
   in the wilderness of Judea, preaching, and saying, "Repent ye, for the
   kingdom of heaven is at hand;." and some time after their election the
   twelve disciples were sent forth among the towns and villages of
   Galilee to repeat the Baptist's message. But Jesus Himself did
   something more than proclaim the advent of the kingdom. He expounded
   the nature of the divine kingdom, described the character of its
   citizens, and discriminated between genuine and spurious members of the
   holy commonwealth. This He did partly in what is familiarly called the
   Sermon on the Mount, preached shortly after the election of the
   apostles; and partly in certain parables uttered about the same period.
   [67]

   In the great discourse delivered on the mountain-top, the
   qualifications for citizenship in the kingdom of heaven were set forth,
   first positively, and then comparatively. The positive truth was summed
   up in seven golden sentences called the Beatitudes, in which the
   felicity of the kingdom was represented as altogether independent of
   the outward conditions with which worldly happiness is associated. The
   blessed, according to the preacher, were the poor, the hungry, the
   mournful, the meek, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peaceable, the
   sufferers for righteousness' sake. Such were blessed themselves, and a
   source of blessing to the human race: the salt of the earth, the light
   of the world raised above others in spirit and character, to draw them
   upwards, and lead them to glorify God.

   Next, with more detail, Jesus exhibited the righteousness of the
   kingdom, and of its true citizens, in contrast to that which prevailed.
   "Except your righteousness," He went on to say with solemn emphasis,
   "shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall
   in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven;." and then He illustrated
   and enforced the general proposition by a detailed description of the
   counterfeit in its moral and religious aspects: in its mode of
   interpreting the moral law, and its manner of performing the duties of
   piety, such as prayer, alms, and fasting. In the one aspect He
   characterized pharisaic righteousness as superficial and technical; in
   the other as ostentatious, self-complacent, and censorious. In contrast
   thereto, He described the ethics of the kingdom as a pure stream of
   life, having charity for its fountainhead; a morality of the heart, not
   merely of outward conduct; a morality also broad and catholic,
   overleaping all arbitrary barriers erected by legal pedantry and
   natural selfishness. The religion of the kingdom He set forth as
   humble, retiring, devoted in singleness of heart to God and things
   supernal; having faith in God as a benignant gracious Father for its
   root, and contentment, cheerfulness, and freedom from secular cares for
   its fruits; and, finally, as reserved in its bearing towards the
   profane, yet averse to severity in judging, yea, to judging at all,
   leaving men to be judged by God.

   The discourse, of which we have given a hasty outline, made a powerful
   impression on the audience. "The people," we read, "were astonished at
   His doctrine; for He taught them as one having authority (the authority
   of wisdom and truth), and not as the scribes," who had merely the
   authority of office. It is not probable that either the multitude or
   the twelve understood the sermon; for it was both deep and lofty, and
   their minds were pre-occupied with very different ideas of the coming
   kingdom. Yet the drift of all that had been said was clear and simple.
   The kingdom whereof Jesus was both King and Lawgiver was not to be a
   kingdom of this world: it was not to be here or there in space, but
   within the heart of man; it was not be the monopoly of any class or
   nation, but open to all possessed of the requisite spiritual endowments
   on equal terms. It is nowhere said, indeed, in the sermon, that ritual
   qualifications, such as circumcision, were not indispensable for
   admission into the kingdom. But circumcision is ignored here, as it was
   ignored the teaching of Jesus. It is treated as something simply out of
   place, which cannot be dove-tailed into the scheme of doctrine set
   forth; an incongruity the very mention of which would create a sense of
   the grotesque. How truly it was so any one can satisfy himself by just
   imagining for a moment that among the Beatitudes had been found one
   running thus: Blessed are the circumcised, for no uncircumcised ones
   shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. This significant silence
   concerning the seal of the national covenant could not fail to have its
   effect on the minds of the disciples, as a hint at eventual
   antiquation.

   The weighty truths thus taught first in the didactic form of an ethical
   discourse, Jesus sought at other times to popularize by means of
   parables. In the course of His ministry He uttered many parabolic
   sayings, the parable being with Him a favorite form of instruction. Of
   the thirty [68] parables preserved in the Gospels, the larger number
   were of an occasional character, and are best understood when viewed in
   connection with the circumstances which called them forth. But there is
   a special group of eight which appear to have been spoken about the
   same period, and to have been designed to serve one object, viz. to
   exhibit in simple pictures the outstanding features of the kingdom of
   heaven in its nature and progress, and in its relations to diverse
   classes of men. One of these, the parable of the sower, apparently the
   first spoken, shows the different reception given to the word of the
   kingdom by various classes of hearers, and the varied issues in their
   life. Two -- the parables of the tares and of the net cast into the sea
   -- describe the mixture of good and evil that should exist in the
   kingdom till the end, when the grand final separation would take place.
   Another pair of short parables -- those of the treasure hid in a field
   and of the precious pearl -- set forth the incomparable importance of
   the kingdom, and of citizenship therein. Other two -- the grain of
   mustard seed, and the leaven hid in three measures of meal -- explain
   how the kingdom advances from small beginnings to a great ending. An
   eighth parable, found in Mark's Gospel only, teaches that growth in the
   divine kingdom proceeds by stages, analogous to the blade, the ear, and
   the full corn in the ear, in the growth of grain. [69]

   These parables, or the greater number of them, were spoken in the
   hearing of a miscellaneous audience; and from a reply of Jesus to a
   question put by the disciples, it might appear that they were intended
   mainly for the ignorant populace. The question was, "Why speakest Thou
   unto them in parables?" and the reply, "Because it is given unto you to
   know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not
   given;." which seems to imply, that in the case of the twelve such
   elementary views of truth -- such children's sermons, so to speak --
   might be dispensed with. Jesus meant no more, however, than that for
   them the parables were not so important as for common hearers, being
   only one of several means of grace through which they were to become
   eventually scribes instructed in the kingdom, acquainted with all its
   mysteries, and able, like a wise householder, to bring out of their
   treasures things new and old; [70] while for the multitude the parables
   were indispensable, as affording their only chance of getting a little
   glimpse into the mysteries of the kingdom.

   That the twelve were not above parables yet appears from the fact that
   they asked and received explanations of them in private from their
   Master: of all, probably, though the interpretations of two only, the
   parables of the sower and the tares, are preserved in the Gospels. [71]
   They were still only children; the parables were pretty pictures to
   them, but of what they could not tell. Even after they had received
   private expositions of their meaning, they were probably not much wiser
   than before, though they professed to be satisfied. [72] Their
   profession was doubtless sincere: they spake as they felt; but they
   spake as children, they understood as children, they thought as
   children, and they had much to learn yet of these divine mysteries.

   When the children had grown to spiritual manhood, and fully understood
   these mysteries, they highly valued the happiness they had enjoyed in
   former years, in being privileged to hear the parables of Jesus. We
   have an interesting memorial of the deep impression produced on their
   minds by these simple pictures of the kingdom, in the reflection with,
   which the first evangelist closes his account of Christ's parabolic
   teaching. "All these things," he remarks, "spake Jesus unto the
   multitude in parables, . . . that it might be fulfilled which was
   spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will
   utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the
   world." [73] The quotation (from the seventy-eighth Psalm)
   significantly diverges both from the Hebrew original and from the
   Septuagint version. [74] Matthew has consciously adapted the words so
   as to express the absolute originality of the teaching in which he
   found their fulfilment. While the Psalmist uttered dark sayings from
   the ancient times of Israel's history, Jesus in the parables had spoken
   things that had been hidden from the creation. Nor was this an
   exaggeration on the part of the evangelist. Even the use of the parable
   as a vehicle of instruction was all but new, and the truths expressed
   in the parables were altogether new. They were indeed the eternal
   verities of the divine kingdom, but till the days of Jesus they had
   remained unannounced. Earthly things had always been fit to emblem
   forth heavenly things; but, till the great Teacher appeared, no one had
   ever thought of linking them together, so that the one should become a
   mirror of the other, revealing the deep things of God to the common
   eye: even as no one before Isaac Newton had thought of connecting the
   fall of an apple with the revolution of the heavenly bodies, though
   apples had fallen to the ground from the creation of the world.

   2. The things which the disciples had the happiness to see in
   connection with the philanthropic work of the kingdom were, if
   possible, still more marvellous than those which they heard in Christ's
   company. They were eye-witnesses of the events which Jesus bade the
   messengers of John report to their master in prison as unquestionable
   evidence that He was the Christ who should come. [75] In their
   presence, as spectators, blind men received their sight, lame men
   walked, lepers were cleansed, the deaf recovered hearing, dead persons
   were raised to life again. The performance of such wonderful works was
   for a time Christ's daily occupation. He went about in Galilee and
   other districts, "doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of
   the devil." [76] The "miracles" recorded in detail in the Gospels give
   no idea whatever of the extent to which these wondrous operations were
   carried on. The leper cleansed on the descent from the mountain, when
   the great sermon was preached, the palsied servant of the Roman
   centurion restored to health and strength, Peter's mother-in-law cured
   of a fever, the demoniac dispossessed in the synagogue of Capernaum,
   the widow's son brought back to life while he was being carried out to
   burial, -- these, and the like, are but a few samples selected out of
   an innumerable multitude of deeds not less remarkable, whether regarded
   as mere miracles or as acts of kindness. The truth of this statement
   appears from paragraphs of frequent recurrence in the Gospels, which
   relate not individual miracles, but an indefinite number of them taken
   en masse. Of such paragraphs take as an example the following,
   cursorily rehearsing the works done by Jesus at the close of a busy
   day: "And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto Him all that
   were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils; and all the
   city was gathered together at the door. And He healed many that were
   sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils." [77] This was what
   happened on a single Sabbath evening in Capernaum, shortly after the
   Sermon on the Mount was preached; and such scenes appear to have been
   common at this time: for we read a little farther on in the same
   Gospel, that "Jesus spake unto His disciples, that a small ship should
   wait on Him because of the multitude, lest they should throng Him; for
   He had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon Him for to touch
   Him, as many as had plagues." [78] And yet again Mark tells how "they
   went into an house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that
   they could not so much as eat bread." [79]

   The inference suggested by such passages as to the vast extent of
   Christ's labors among the suffering, is borne out by the impressions
   these made on the minds both of friends and foes. The ill-affected were
   so struck by what they saw, that they found it necessary to get up a
   theory to account for the mighty influence exerted by Jesus in curing
   physical, and especially psychical maladies. "This fellow," they said,
   "doth not cast out devils but by Beelzebub the prince of devils." It
   was a lame theory, as Jesus showed; but it was at least conclusive
   evidence that devils were cast out, and in great numbers.

   The thoughts of the well-affected concerning the works of Jesus were
   various, but all which have been recorded involve a testimony to His
   vast activity and extraordinary zeal. Some, apparently relatives,
   deemed him mad, fancying that enthusiasm had disturbed His mind, and
   compassionately sought to save Him from doing Himself harm through
   excessive solicitude to do good to others. [80] The sentiments of the
   people who received benefit were more devout. "They marvelled, and
   glorified God, which had given such power unto men;." [81] and they
   were naturally not inclined to criticise an "enthusiasm of humanity"
   whereof they were themselves the objects.

   The contemporaneous impressions of the twelve concerning their Master's
   deeds are not recorded; but of their subsequent reflections as apostles
   we have an interesting sample in the observations appended by the first
   evangelist to his account of the transactions of that Sabbath evening
   in Capernaum already alluded to. The devout Matthew, according to his
   custom, saw in these wondrous works Old Testament Scripture fulfilled;
   and the passage whose fulfilment he found therein was that touching
   oracle of Isaiah, "Surely He hath borne our griefs and carried our
   sorrows;." which, departing from the Septuagint, he made apt to his
   purpose by rendering, "Himself took our infirmities and bore our
   sicknesses." [82] The Greek translators interpreted the text as
   referring to men's spiritual maladies -- their sins; [83] but Matthew
   deemed it neither a misapplication nor a degradation of the words to
   find in them a prophecy of Messiah's deep sympathy with such as
   suffered from any disease, whether spiritual or mental, or merely
   physical. He knew not how better to express the intense compassion of
   his Lord towards all sufferers, than by representing Him in prophetic
   language as taking their sicknesses on Himself. Nor did he wrong the
   prophet's thought by this application of it. He but laid the foundation
   of an Ã  fortiori inference to a still more intense sympathy on the
   Saviour's part with the spiritually diseased. For surely He who so
   cared for men's bodies would care yet more for their souls. Surely it
   might safely be anticipated, that He who was so conspicuous as a healer
   of bodily disease would become yet more famous as a Saviour from sin.

   The works which the twelve were privileged to see were verily worth
   seeing, and altogether worthy of the Messianic King. They served to
   demonstrate that the King and the kingdom were not only coming, but
   come; for what could more certainly betoken their presence, than mercy
   dropping like the "gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath"?
   John, indeed, seems to have thought otherwise, when he sent to inquire
   of Jesus if He were the Christ who was to come. He desiderated, we
   imagine, a work of judgment on the impenitent as a more reliable proof
   of Messiah's advent than these miracles of mercy. The prophetic
   infirmity of querulousness and the prison air had got the better of his
   judgment and his heart, and he was in the truculent humor of Jonah, who
   was displeased with God, not because He was too stern, but rather
   because He was too gracious, too ready to forgive.

   The least in the kingdom of heaven is incapable now of being offended
   with these works of our Lord on account of their mercifulness. The
   offence in our day lies in a different direction. Men stumble at the
   miraculousness of the things seen by the disciples and recorded by the
   evangelists. Mercy, say they, is God-like, but miracles are impossible;
   and they think they do well to be sceptical. An exception is made,
   indeed, in favor of some of the healing miracles, because it is not
   deemed impossible that they might fall within the course of nature, and
   so cease to belong to the category of the miraculous. "Moral
   therapeutics" might account for them -- a department of medical science
   which Mr. Matthew Arnold thinks has not been at all sufficiently
   studied yet. [84] All other miracles besides those wrought by moral
   therapeutics are pronounced fabulous. But why not extend the dominion
   of the moral over the physical, and say without qualification: Mercy is
   God-like, therefore such works as those wrought by Jesus were matters
   of course? So they appeared to the writers of the Gospels. What they
   wondered at was not the supernaturalness of Christ's healing
   operations, but the unfathomable depth of divine compassion which they
   revealed. There is no trace of the love of the marvellous either in the
   Gospels or in the Epistles. The disciples may have experienced such a
   feeling when the era of wonders first burst on their astonished view,
   but they had lost it entirely by the time the New Testament books began
   to be written. [85] Throughout the New Testament miracles are spoken of
   in a sober, almost matter-of-fact, tone. How is this to be explained?
   The explanation is that the apostles had seen too many miracles while
   with Jesus to be excited about them. Their sense of wonder had been
   deadened by being sated. But though they ceased to marvel at the power
   of their Lord, they never ceased to wonder at His grace. The love of
   Christ remained for them throughout life a thing passing knowledge; and
   the longer they lived, the more cordially did they acknowledge the
   truth of their Master's words: "Blessed are the eyes which see the
   things that ye see"

   [66] Luke x. 23, 24. The authors of the Revised Version have introduced
   many changes in the A. V. by stricter rendering of tenses, and
   especially of the aorists, which in the old version are frequently
   treated as perfects. They may have carried this too far, but on the
   whole they have rendered good service in this department.

   [67] That the election of the twelve preceded the utterance of the
   parables is plain from Mark iv. 10, "They that were about Him with the

6. LESSONS ON PRAYER

    Matt. 6:5-13; 7:7-11; Luke 11:1-13; 18:1-5.

   It would have been matter for surprise if, among the manifold subjects
   on which Jesus gave instruction to His disciples, prayer had not
   occupied a prominent place. Prayer is a necessity of spiritual life,
   and all who earnestly try to pray soon feel the need of teaching how to
   do it. And what theme more likely to engage the thoughts of a Master
   who was Himself emphatically a man of prayer, spending occasionally
   whole nights in prayerful communion with His heavenly Father? [86]

   We find, accordingly, that prayer was a subject on which Jesus often
   spoke in the hearing of His disciples. In the Sermon on the Mount, for
   example, He devoted a paragraph to that topic, in which He cautioned
   His hearers against pharisaic ostentation and heathenish repetition,
   and recited a form of devotion as a model of simplicity,
   comprehensiveness, and brevity. [87] At other times He directed
   attention to the necessity, in order to acceptable and prevailing
   prayer, of perseverance, [88] concord, [89] strong faith, [90] and
   large expectation. [91]

   The passage cited from the eleventh chapter of Luke's Gospel gives an
   account of what may be regarded as the most complete and comprehensive
   of all the lessons communicated by Jesus to His disciples on the
   important subject to which it relates. The circumstances in which this
   lesson was given are interesting. The lesson on prayer was itself an
   answer to prayer. A disciple, in all probability one of the twelve,
   [92] after hearing Jesus pray, made the request: "Lord, teach us to
   pray, as John also taught his disciples." The request and its occasion
   taken together convey to us incidentally two pieces of information.
   From the latter we learn that Jesus, besides praying much alone, also
   prayed in company with His disciples, practising family prayer as the
   head of a household, as well as secret prayer in personal fellowship
   with God His Father. From the former we learn that the social prayers
   of Jesus were most impressive. Disciples hearing them were made
   painfully conscious of their own incapacity, and after the Amen were
   ready instinctively to proffer the request, "Lord, teach us to pray,"
   as if ashamed any more to attempt the exercise in their own feeble,
   vague, stammering words.

   When this lesson was given we know not, for Luke introduces his
   narrative of it in the most indefinite manner, without noting either
   time or place. The reference to John in the past tense might seem to
   indicate a date subsequent to his death; but the mode of expression
   would be sufficiently explained by the supposition that the disciple
   who made the request had previously been a disciple of the Baptist.
   [93] Nor can any certain inference be drawn from the contents of the
   lesson. It is a lesson which might have been given to the twelve at any
   time during their disciplehood, so far as their spiritual necessities
   were concerned. It is a lesson for children, for spiritual minors, for
   Christians in the crude stage of the divine life, afflicted with
   confusion of mind, dumbness, dejection, unable to pray for want of
   clear thought, apt words, and above all, of faith that knows how to
   wait in hope; and it meets the wants of such by suggesting topics,
   supplying forms of language, and furnishing their weak faith with the
   props of cogent arguments for perseverance. Now such was the state of
   the twelve during all the time they were with Jesus; till He ascended
   to heaven, and power descended from heaven on them, bringing with it a
   loosed tongue and an enlarged heart. During the whole period of their
   discipleship, they needed prompting in prayer such as a mother gives
   her child, and exhortations to perseverance in the habit of praying,
   even as do the humblest followers of Christ. Far from being exempt from
   such infirmities, the twelve may even have experienced them in a
   superlative degree. The heights correspond to the depths in religious
   experience. Men who are destined to be apostles must, as disciples,
   know more than most of the chaotic, speechless condition, and of the
   great, irksome, but most salutary business of Waiting on God for light,
   and truth, and grace, earnestly desired but long withheld.

   It was well for the church that her first ministers needed this lesson
   on prayer; for the time comes in the case of most, if not all, who are
   spiritually earnest, when its teaching is very seasonable. In the
   spring of the divine life, the beautiful blossom-time of piety,
   Christians may be able to pray with fluency and fervor, unembarrassed
   by want of words, thoughts, and feelings of a certain kind. But that
   happy stage soon passes, and is succeeded by one in which prayer often
   becomes a helpless struggle, an inarticulate groan, a silent,
   distressed, despondent waiting on God, on the part of men who are
   tempted to doubt whether God be indeed the hearer of prayer, whether
   prayer be not altogether idle and useless. The three wants contemplated
   and provided for in this lesson -- the want of ideas, of words, and of
   faith -- are as common as they are grievous. How long it takes most to
   fill even the simple petitions of the Lord's Prayer with definite
   meanings! the second petition, e.g., "Thy kingdom come," which can be
   presented with perfect intelligence only by such as have formed for
   themselves a clear conception of the ideal spiritual republic or
   commonwealth. How difficult, and therefore how rare, to find out
   acceptable words for precious thoughts slowly reached! How many, who
   have never got any thing on which their hearts were set without needing
   to ask for it often, and to wait for it long (no uncommon experience),
   have been tempted by the delay to give up asking in despair! And no
   wonder; for delay is hard to bear in all cases, especially in
   connection with spiritual blessings, which are in fact, and are by
   Christ here assumed to be, the principal object of a Christian man's
   desires. Devout souls would not be utterly confounded by delay, or even
   refusal, in connection with mere temporal goods; for they know that
   such things as health, wealth, wife, children, home, position, are not
   unconditionally good, and that it may be well sometimes not to obtain
   them, or not easily and too soon. But it is most confounding to desire
   with all one's heart the Holy Ghost, and yet seem to be denied the
   priceless boon; to pray for light, and to get instead deeper darkness;
   for faith, and to be tormented with doubts which shake cherished
   convictions to their foundations; for sanctity, and to have the mud of
   corruption stirred up by temptation from the bottom of the well of
   eternal life in the heart. Yet all this, as every experienced Christian
   knows, is part of the discipline through which scholars in Christ's
   school have to pass ere the desire of their heart be fulfilled. [94]

   The lesson on prayer taught by Christ, in answer to request, consists
   of two parts, in one of which thoughts and words are put into the
   mouths of immature disciples, while the other provides aids to faith in
   God as the answerer of prayer. There is first a form of prayer, and
   then an argument enforcing perseverance in prayer.

   The form of prayer commonly called the Lord's Prayer, which appears in
   the Sermon on the Mount as a sample of the right kind of prayer, is
   given here as a summary of the general heads under which all special
   petitions may be comprehended. We may call this form the alphabet of
   all possible prayer. It embraces the elements of all spiritual desire,
   summed up in a few choice sentences, for the benefit of those who may
   not be able to bring their struggling aspirations to birth in
   articulate language. It contains in all six petitions, of which three
   -- the first three, as was meet -- refer to God's glory, and the
   remaining three to man's good. We are taught to pray, first for the
   advent of the divine kingdom, in the form of universal reverence for
   the divine name, and universal obedience to the divine will; and then,
   in the second place, for daily bread, pardon, and protection from evil
   for ourselves. The whole is addressed to God as Father, and is supposed
   to proceed from such as realize their fellowship one with another as
   members of a divine family, and therefore say, "Our Father." The prayer
   does not end, as our prayers now commonly do, with the formula, "for
   Christ's sake;." nor could it, consistently with the supposition that
   it proceeded from Jesus. No prayer given by Him for the present use of
   His disciples, before His death, could have such an ending, because the
   plea it contains was not intelligible to them previous to that event.
   The twelve did not yet know what Christ's sake (sache) meant, nor would
   they till after their Lord had ascended, and the Spirit had descended
   and revealed to them the true meaning of the facts of Christ's earthly
   history. Hence we find Jesus, on the eve of His passion, telling His
   disciples that up to that time they had asked nothing in His name, and
   representing the use of His name as a plea to be heard, as one of the
   privileges awaiting them in the future. "Hitherto," He said, "have ye
   asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may
   be full." [95] And in another part of His discourse: "Whatsoever ye
   shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified
   in the Son." [96]

   To what extent the disciples afterwards made use of this beautifully
   simple yet profoundly significant form, we do not know; but it may be
   assumed that they were in the habit of repeating it as the disciples of
   the Baptist might repeat the forms taught them by their master. There
   is, however, no reason to think that the "Lord's Prayer," though of
   permanent value as a part of Christ's teaching, was designed to be a
   stereotyped, binding method of addressing the Father in heaven. It was
   meant to be an aid to inexperienced disciples, not a rule imposed upon
   apostles. [97] Even after they had attained to spiritual maturity, the
   twelve might use this form if they pleased, and possibly they did
   occasionally use it; but Jesus expected that by the time they came to
   be teachers in the church they should have outgrown the need of it as
   an aid to devotion. Filled with the Spirit, enlarged in heart, mature
   in spiritual understanding, they should then be able to pray as their
   Lord had prayed when He was with them; and while the six petitions of
   the model prayer would still enter into all their supplications at the
   throne of grace, they would do so only as the alphabet of a language
   enters into the most extended and eloquent utterances of a speaker, who
   never thinks of the letters of which the words he utters are composed.
   [98]

   In maintaining the provisional, pro tempore character of the Lords'
   Prayer, so far as the twelve were concerned, we lay no stress on the
   fact already adverted to, that it does not end with the phrase, "for
   Christ's sake." That defect could easily be supplied afterwards
   mentally or orally, and therefore was no valid reason for disuse. The
   same remark applies to our use of the prayer in question. To allow this
   form to fall into desuetude merely because the customary concluding
   plea is wanting, is as weak on one side as the too frequent repetition
   of it is on the other. The Lord's Prayer is neither a piece of Deism
   unworthy of a Christian, nor a magic charm like the "Pater noster" of
   Roman Catholic devotion. The most advanced believer will often find
   relief and rest to his spirit in falling back on its simple, sublime
   sentences, while mentally realizing the manifold particulars which each
   of them includes; and he is but a tyro in the art of praying, and in
   the divine life generally, whose devotions consist exclusively, or even
   mainly, in repeating the words which Jesus put into the mouths of
   immature disciples.

   The view now advocated regarding the purpose of the Lord's Prayer is in
   harmony with the spirit of Christ's whole teaching. Liturgical forms
   and religious methodism in general were much more congenial to the
   strict ascetic school of the Baptist than to the free school of Jesus.
   Our Lord evidently attached little importance to forms of prayer, any
   more than to fixed periodic fasts, else He would not have waited till
   He was asked for a form, but would have made systematic provision for
   the wants of His followers, even as the Baptist did, by, so to speak,
   compiling a book of devotion or composing a liturgy. It is evident,
   even from the present instructions on the subject of praying, that
   Jesus considered the form He supplied of quite subordinate importance:
   a mere temporary remedy for a minor evil, the want of utterance, till
   the greater evil, the want of faith, should be cured; for the larger
   portion of the lesson is devoted to the purpose of supplying an
   antidote to unbelief. [99]

   The second part of this lesson on prayer is intended to convey the same
   moral as that which is prefixed to the parable of the unjust judge --
   "that men ought always to pray, and not to faint." The supposed cause
   of fainting is also the same, even delay on the part of God in
   answering our prayers. This is not, indeed, made so obvious in the
   earlier lesson as in the later. The parable of the ungenerous neighbor
   is not adapted to convey the idea of long delay: for the favor asked,
   if granted at all, must be granted in a very few minutes. But the lapse
   of time between the presenting and the granting of our requests is
   implied and presupposed as a matter of course. It is by delay that God
   seems to say to us what the ungenerous neighbor said to his friend, and
   that we are tempted to think that we pray to no purpose.

   Both the parables spoken by Christ to inculcate perseverance in prayer
   seek to effect their purpose by showing the power of importunity in the
   most unpromising circumstances. The characters appealed to are both bad
   -- one in ungenerous, and the other unjust; and from neither is any
   thing to be gained except by working on his selfishness. And the point
   of the parable in either case is, that importunity has a power of
   annoyance which enables it to gain its object.

   It is important again to observe what is supposed to be the leading
   subject of prayer in connection with the argument now to be considered.
   The thing upon which Christ assumes His disciples to have set their
   hearts is personal sanctification. [100] This appears from the
   concluding sentence of the discourse: "How much more shall your
   heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him!" Jesus takes
   for granted that the persons to whom He addresses Himself here seek
   first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. Therefore, though He
   inserted a petition for daily bread in the form of prayer, He drops
   that object out of view in the latter part of His discourse; both
   because it is by hypothesis not the chief object of desire, and also
   because, for all who truly give God's kingdom the first place in their
   regards, food and raiment are thrown into the bargain. [101]

   To such as do not desire the Holy Spirit above all things, Jesus has
   nothing to say. He does not encourage them to hope that they shall
   receive any thing of the Lord; least of all, the righteousness of the
   kingdom, personal sanctification. He regards the prayers of a
   double-minded man, who has two chief ends in view, as a hollow mockery
   -- mere words, which never reach Heaven's ear.

   The supposed cause of fainting being delay, and the supposed object of
   desire being the Holy Spirit, the spiritual situation contemplated in
   the argument is definitely determined. The Teacher's aim is to succor
   and encourage those who feel that the work of grace goes slowly on
   within them, and wonder why it does so, and sadly sigh because it does
   so. Such we conceive to have been the state of the twelve when this
   lesson was given them. They had been made painfully conscious of
   incapacity to perform aright their devotional duties, and they took
   that incapacity to be an index of their general spiritual condition,
   and were much depressed in consequence.

   The argument by which Jesus sought to inspire His discouraged disciples
   with hope and confidence as to the ultimate fulfilment of their
   desires, is characterized by boldness, geniality, wisdom, and logical
   force. Its boldness is evinced in the choice of illustrations . Jesus
   has such confidence in the goodness of His cause, that He states the
   case as disadvantageously for Himself as possible, by selecting for
   illustration not good samples of men, but persons rather below than
   above the ordinary standard of human virtue. A man who, on being
   applied to at any hour of the night by a neighbor for help in a real
   emergency, such as that supposed in the parable, or in a case of sudden
   sickness, should put him off with such an answer as this, "Trouble me
   not, the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot
   rise and give thee," would justly incur the contempt of his
   acquaintances, and become a byword among them for all that is
   ungenerous and heartless. The same readiness to take an extreme case is
   observable in the second argument, drawn from the conduct of fathers
   towards their children. "If a son shall ask bread of any of you" -- so
   it begins. [102] Jesus does not care what father may be selected; He is
   willing to take any one they please: He will take the very worst as
   readily as the best; nay, more readily, for the argument turns not on
   the goodness of the parent, but rather on his want of goodness, as it
   aims to show that no special goodness is required to keep all parents
   from doing what would be an outrage on natural affection, and revolting
   to the feelings of all mankind.

   The genial, kindly character of the argument is manifest from the
   insight and sympathy displayed therein. Jesus divines what hard
   thoughts men think of God under the burden of unfulfilled desire; how
   they doubt His goodness, and deem Him indifferent, heartless, unjust.
   He shows His intimate knowledge of their secret imaginations by the
   cases He puts; for the unkind friend and unnatural father, and we may
   add, the unjust judge, are pictures not indeed of what God is, or of
   what He would have us believe God to be, but certainly of what even
   pious men sometimes think Him to be. [103] And He cannot only divine,
   but sympathize. He does not, like Job's friends, find fault with those
   who harbor doubting and apparently profane thoughts, nor chide them for
   impatience, distrust, and despondency. He deals with them as men
   compassed with infirmity, and needing sympathy, counsel, and help. And
   in supplying these, He comes down to their level of feeling, and tries
   to show that, even if things were as they seem, there is no cause for
   despair. He argues from their own thoughts of God, that they should
   still hope in Him. "Suppose," He says in effect, "God to be what you
   fancy, indifferent and heartless, still pray on; see, in the case I
   put, what perseverance can effect. Ask as the man who wanted loaves
   asked, and ye shall also receive from Him who seems at present deaf to
   your petitions. Appearances, I grant, may be very unfavorable, but they
   cannot be more so in your case than in that of the petitioner in the
   parable; and yet you observe how he fared through not being too easily
   disheartened."

   Jesus displays His wisdom in dealing with the doubts of His disciples,
   by avoiding all elaborate explanations of the causes or reasons of
   delay in the answering of prayer, and using only arguments adapted to
   the capacity of persons weak in faith and in spiritual understanding.
   He does not attempt to show why sanctification is a slow, tedious work,
   not a momentary act: why the Spirit is given gradually and in limited
   measure, not at once and without measure. He simply urges His hearers
   to persevere in seeking the Holy Spirit, assuring them that, in spite
   of trying delay, their desires will be fulfilled in the end. He teaches
   them no philosophy of waiting on God, but only tells them that they
   shall not wait in vain.

   This method the Teacher followed not from necessity, but from choice.
   For though no attempt was made at explaining divine delays in
   providence and grace, it was not because explanation was impossible.
   There were many things which Christ might have said to His disciples at
   this time if they could have borne them; some of which they afterwards
   said themselves, when the Spirit of Truth had come, and guided them
   into all truth, and made them acquainted with the secret of God's way.
   He might have pointed out to them, e.g., that the delays of which they
   complained were according to the analogy of nature, in which gradual
   growth is the universal law; that time was needed for the production of
   the ripe fruits of the Spirit, just in the same way as for the
   production of the ripe fruits of the field or of the orchard; that it
   was not to be wondered at if the spiritual fruits were peculiarly slow
   in ripening, as it was a law of growth that the higher the product in
   the scale of being, the slower the process by which it is produced;
   [104] that a momentary sanctification, though not impossible, would be
   as much a miracle in the sense of a departure from law, as was the
   immediate transformation of water into wine at the marriage in Cana;
   that if instantaneous sanctification were the rule instead of the rare
   exception, the kingdom of grace would become too like the imaginary
   worlds of children's dreams, in which trees, fruits, and palaces spring
   into being full-grown, ripe, and furnished, in a moment as by
   enchantment, and too unlike the real, actual world with which men are
   conversant, in which delay, growth, and fixed law are invariable
   characteristics.

   Jesus might further have sought to reconcile His disciples to delay by
   descanting on the virtue of patience. Much could be said on that topic.
   It could be shown that a character cannot be perfect in which the
   virtue of patience has no place, and that the gradual method of
   sanctification is best adapted for its development, as affording
   abundant scope for its exercise. It might be pointed out how much the
   ultimate enjoyment of any good thing is enhanced by its having to be
   waited for; how in proportion to the trial is the triumph of faith;
   how, in the quaint words of one who was taught wisdom in this matter by
   his own experience, and by the times in which he lived, "It is fit we
   see and feel the shaping and sewing of every piece of the wedding
   garment, and the framing and moulding and fitting of the crown of glory
   for the head of the citizen of heaven;." how "the repeated sense and
   frequent experience of grace in the ups and downs in the way, the falls
   and risings again of the traveller, the revolutions and changes of the
   spiritual condition, the new moon, the darkened moon, the full moon in
   the Spirit's ebbing and flowing, raiseth in the heart of saints on
   their way to the country a sweet smell of the fairest rose and lily of
   Sharon;." how, "as travellers at night talk of their foul ways, and of
   the praises of their guide, and battle being ended, soldiers number
   their wounds, extol the valor, skill, and courage of their leader and
   captain," so "it is meet that the glorified soldiers may take loads of
   experience of free grace to heaven with them, and there speak of their
   way and their country, and the praises of Him that hath redeemed them
   out of all nations, tongues, and languages. [105] "

   Such considerations, however just, would have been wasted on men in the
   spiritual condition of the disciples. Children have no sympathy with
   growth in any world, whether of nature or of grace. Nothing pleases
   them but that an acorn should become an oak at once, and that
   immediately after the blossom should come the ripe fruit. Then it is
   idle to speak of the uses of patience to the inexperienced; for the
   moral value of the discipline of trial cannot be appreciated till the
   trial is past. Therefore, as before stated, Jesus abstained entirely
   from reflections of the kind suggested, and adopted a simple, popular
   style of reasoning which even a child could understand.

   The reasoning of Jesus, while very simple, is very cogent and
   conclusive. The first argument -- that contained in the parable of the
   ungenerous neighbor -- is fitted to inspire hope in God, even in the
   darkest hour, when He appears indifferent to our cry, or positively
   unwilling to help, and so to induce us to persevere in asking. "As the
   man who wanted the loaves knocked on louder and louder, with an
   importunity that knew no shame, [106] and would take no refusal, and
   thereby gained his object, the selfish friend being glad at last to get
   up and serve him out of sheer regard to his own comfort, it being
   simply impossible to sleep with such a noise; so (such is the drift of
   the argument), so continue thou knocking at the door of heaven, and
   thou shalt obtain thy desire if it were only to be rid of thee. See in
   this parable what a power importunity has, even at a most unpromising
   time -- midnight -- and with a most unpromising person, who prefers his
   own comfort to a neighbor's good: ask, therefore, persistently, and it
   shall be given unto you also; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
   shall be opened unto you."

   At one point, indeed, this most pathetic and sympathetic argument seems
   to be weak. The petitioner in the parable had the selfish friend in his
   power by being able to annoy him and keep him from sleeping. Now, the
   tried desponding disciple whom Jesus would comfort may rejoin: "What
   power have I to annoy God, who dwelleth on high, far beyond my reach,
   in imperturbable felicity? Oh that I knew where I might find Him, that
   I might come even to His seat! But, behold, I go forward, but He is not
   there; and backward, but I cannot perceive Him: on the left hand, where
   He doth work, but I cannot behold Him: He hideth Himself on the right
   hand, that I cannot see Him.'" [107] The objection is one which can
   hardly fail to occur to the subtle spirit of despondency, and it must
   be admitted that it is not frivolous. There is really a failure of the
   analogy at this point. We can annoy a man, like the ungenerous neighbor
   in bed, or the unjust judge, but we cannot annoy God. The parable does
   not suggest the true explanation of divine delay, or of the ultimate
   success of importunity. It merely proves, by a homely instance, that
   delay, apparent refusal, from whatever cause it may arise, is not
   necessarily final, and therefore can be no good reason for giving up
   asking.

   This is a real if not a great service rendered. But the doubting
   disciple, besides discovering with characteristic acuteness what the
   parable fails to prove, may not be able to extract any comfort from
   what it does prove. What is he to do then? Fall back on the strong
   asseveration with which Jesus follows up the parable: "And I say unto
   you." Here, doubter, is an oracular dictum from One who can speak with
   authority; One who has been in the bosom of the eternal God, and has
   come forth to reveal His inmost heart to men groping in the darkness of
   nature after Him, if haply they might find Him. When He addresses you
   in such emphatic, solemn terms as these, "I say unto you, Ask, and it
   shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be
   opened unto you," you may take the matter on His word, at least pro
   tempore. Even those who doubt the reasonableness of prayer, because of
   the constancy of nature's laws and the unchangeableness of divine
   purposes, might take Christ's word for it that prayer is not vain, even
   in relation to daily bread, not to speak of higher matters, until they
   arrive at greater certainty on the subject than they can at present
   pretend to. Such may, if they choose, despise the parable as childish,
   or as conveying crude anthropopathic ideas of the Divine Being, but
   they cannot despise the deliberate declarations of One whom even they
   regard as the wisest and best of men.

   The second argument employed by Jesus to urge perseverance in prayer is
   of the nature of a reductio ad absurdum, ending with a conclusion Ã 
   fortiori. "If," it is reasoned, "God refused to hear His children's
   prayers, or, worse still, if He mocked them by giving them something
   bearing a superficial resemblance to the things asked, only to cause
   bitter disappointment when the deception was discovered, then were He
   not only as bad as, but far worse than, even the most depraved of
   mankind. For, take fathers at random, which of them, if a son were to
   ask bread, would give him a stone? or if he asked a fish, would give
   him a serpent? or if he asked an egg, would offer him a scorpion? The
   very supposition is monstrous. Human nature is largely vitiated by
   moral evil; there is, in particular, an evil spirit of selfishness in
   the heart which comes into conflict with the generous affections, and
   leads men ofttimes to do base and unnatural things. But men taken at
   the average are not diabolic; and nothing short of a diabolic spirit of
   mischief could prompt a father to mock a child's misery, or
   deliberately to give him things fraught with deadly harm. If, then,
   earthly parents, though evil in many of their dispositions, give good,
   and, so far as they know, only good, gifts to their children, and would
   shrink with horror from any other mode of treatment, is it to be
   credited that the Divine Being, that Providence, can do what only
   devils would think of doing? On the contrary, what is only barely
   possible for man is for God altogether impossible, and what all but
   monsters of iniquity will not fail to do God will do much more. He will
   most surely give good gifts, and only good gifts, to His asking
   children; most especially will He give His best gift, which His true
   children desire above all things, even the Holy Spirit, the enlightener
   and the sanctifier. Therefore again I say unto you: Ask, and ye shall
   receive; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened."

   Yet it is implied in the very fact that Christ puts such cases as a
   stone given for bread, a serpent for a fish, or a scorpion for an egg,
   that God seems at least sometimes so to treat His children. The time
   came when the twelve thought they had been so treated in reference to
   the very subject in which they were most deeply interested, after their
   own personal sanctification, viz., the restoration of the kingdom to
   Israel. But their experience illustrates the general truth, that when
   the Hearer of prayer seems to deal unnaturally with His servants, it is
   because they have made a mistake about the nature of good, and have not
   known what they asked. They have asked for a stone, thinking it bread,
   and hence the true bread seems a stone; for a shadow, thinking it a
   substance, and hence the substance seems a shadow. The kingdom for
   which the twelve prayed was a shadow, hence their disappointment and
   despair when Jesus was put to death: the egg of hope, which their fond
   imagination had been hatching, brought forth the scorpion of the cross,
   and they fancied that God had mocked and deceived them. But they lived
   to see that God was true and good, and that they had deceived
   themselves, and that all which Christ had told them had been fulfilled.
   And all who wait on God ultimately make a similar discovery, and unite
   in testifying that "the Lord is good unto them that wait for Him, to
   the soul that seeketh Him." [108]

   For these reasons should all men pray, and not faint. Prayer is
   rational, even if the Divine Being were like men in the average, not
   indisposed to do good when self-interest does not stand in the way --
   the creed of heathenism. It is still more manifestly rational if, as
   Christ taught and Christians believe, God be better than the best of
   men -- the one supremely good Being -- the Father in heaven. Only in
   either of two cases would prayer really be irrational: if God were no
   living being at all, -- the creed of atheists, with whom Christ holds
   no argument; or if He were a being capable of doing things from which
   even bad men would start back in horror, i.e., a being of diabolic
   nature, -- the creed, it is to be hoped, of no human being.

   [98] Keim takes the same view: he thinks the Mustergebet was not meant
   to be an Alltagsgebet, and in proof adduces the facts that no trace of
   its use appears in the history of Christ's own life, in the times of
   the Jerusalem Church, in the recollections of the Apostle Paul, and
   that only in the second century it began to be the object of a regular
   "ja mechanisch-katholischen" use. -- Jesu von Nazara, ii. 280.

   [99] From the design of the Lord's Prayer as now explained we may
   determine the proper place and use of all fixed forms of devotion.
   Liturgical forms are for private rather than for public use; for those
   who are in the dumb, arid stage of the spiritual life, rather than for
   those who have attained the power and utterance of spiritual maturity.
   To the private use of such forms by persons who desire to pray, yet
   cannot do it, no reasonable objection can be taken. Advantage justifies
   use. The less experienced Christian may ask the more experienced to
   teach him to pray, and the more experienced may reply, "After this
   manner pay ye." If we may read and repeat the sacred songs of Christian
   poets to find expression for emotions which are common to us and them,
   but which we cannot, like them, adequately express, why may we not read
   and repeat the prayers of the saints for a similar purpose? The
   superficial, who have not earnestness and sincerity enough to know what
   it is to stammer, may despise such aids as suited only for children;
   and those who are yet in the first flush of religious fervor may turn
   away from written forms as cold and dead, however classical. Well, let
   all do without such aids who can; only the time may come, even for the
   fervent, when, forsaken of emotion, deficient in experience,
   discouraged by failure, disappointed in ardent youthful hopes,
   tormented by speculative doubts concerning the utility and the
   reasonableness of prayer coming over the soul like chill east winds in
   the winter of its religious history, they may be very glad to read over
   forms of devotion which, by their simplicity and dignity, serve to
   inspire a sense of reality, and to produce a soothing, sedative effect
   on their distressed, restless spirits. For all such a plight, we,
   having respect to the example of Christ, are entitled to plead that
   they shall not be required to remain prayerless because they cannot for
   the time pray without book. But when we pass from the closet to the
   church, the case is altered. There we ought to find pastors capable of
   doing, each one for his fellow-worshippers, what Christ did for His
   disciples, and of praying with the freedom and force to which the
   disciples themselves afterwards attained. It may be asserted, inded,
   that this, though the desirable, is not the actual state of matters. A
   recent writer, in advocating the introduction of written forms of
   prayer into the Presbyterian Church, says: "I feel persuaded that a
   verbatim report of all the public prayers uttered in Scotland any one
   Sunday in the year would settle the question forever in the mind of
   every person who was capable of forming a rational judgment on such a
   matter" [The Reform of the Church of Scotland, by Robert Lee, D.D., p.
   76.]. It is to be hoped that this is an exaggerated view of existing
   ministerial incapacity; but even granting its accuracy, it is a fair
   question whether the remedy proposed would not be worse than the evil,
   and the gain in propriety more than counterbalanced by a loss in the
   more important quality of fervor. This much we may say, even if not
   disposed to take up high ground of principles in opposition to
   liturgical forms, but rather to concur in the moderate sentiments of
   Richard Baxter, when he says: "I cannot be of their opinion who think
   God will not accept him that prayeth by the common Prayer-book, and
   that such forms are a self-invented worship which God rejecteth; nor
   yet can I be of their mind that say the like of extemporary prayers"
   [Baxter's Life, from his own original MS., lib. i. part i. Â§ 213.]. In
   Baxter's time religious controversy ran very high, and opposed views
   were stated in extreme form. The Churchman derided the extempore
   effusions of the Puritan; the Puritans went so far in his opposition to
   liturgical prayer as even to maintain that the Lord's Prayer itself
   should never be repeated. Baxter, not being a partisan, but a lover of
   truth, sympathized with neither party, but regarded the question at
   issue as one of policy rather than of principle, to be settled not by
   abstract reasoning, but by a calm consideration of what on the whole
   was most conducive to edification; in which point of view his judgment
   and his practice were both on the side of extempore prayer. Looking at
   the question, with Baxter, as one of policy, we are fully persuaded
   that the existing practice of Presbyterian and other churches can be
   justified on such good grounds as should make them contented, to say
   the least, with their own way, and indisposed to imitate those whose
   way is different in this matter. The ministers of religion, like the
   apostles, ought to be able to dispense with liturgical forms; and the
   best way to secure that they shall possess such ability, is to throw
   them on their own resources, and on God, and so convert the ideal into
   a requirement applicable to all, making no provision for exceptions.
   The full benefit of a system cannot be obtained unless it be rigidly
   enforced; and while such enforcement may involve occasional
   disadvantages, the relaxation of the rule would probably produce
   greater damage to the church. Allowance made for timidity,
   inexperience, or extraordinary incapacity, would be abused by the
   indolent and the careless; and many would remain permanently in a state
   similar to that of the disciples, who, if compelled to stir up the gift
   of God which is in them, or to seek earnestly gifts and graces not
   possessed, might ere long attain to apostolic freedom and power. The
   same remarks might be applied to preaching. In individual instances
   congregations might benefit by the preacher being allowed to use
   foreign materials of instruction; but under such a permission, how many
   would content themselves with reading sermons out of books, or from
   manuscripts purchased at so much per dozen, who, under a system aiming
   at turning to the utmost account individual talent, and therefore
   requiring all teachers of truth to give their hearers the benefit of
   their own thoughts, would through practice attain to a fair measure of
   preaching power. On the whole, therefore, the Presbyterian Church has
   reason to be satisfied with its existing system of public worship,
   whatever reason there may be for dissatisfaction with the existing
   state of worship in particular instances. The ideal is good, however
   far short the reality may come of it. The aim and effect of the
   liturgical system is to make the mass of worshippers as independent as
   possible of the individual minister; the aim, if not the effect of our
   system, is to make individual ministers as valuable as possible to the
   worshippers, for their instruction and edification. The one system may
   secure a uniform solemnity and decency, but the other system tends to
   secure the more important qualities of fervor, energy, and life; and we
   believe, whatever fastidious critics may allege, it does to a
   considerable extent secure them. At lowest, the non-liturgical method
   secures that the worship of the church shall be a true reflection of
   here life, and therefore, however beggarly, at least sincere. Men who
   preach their own sermons and pray their own prayers are more likely to
   preach and pray as they believe and live, than those who merely read
   compositions provided to their hand. It only remains to add, that while
   having no objection on principle to an attempt at amalgamating the two
   methods so as to reap the advantages of both -- a scheme favored by
   some respected brethren in all the churches -- we confess to grave
   doubts, for the reasons above explained, as to the utility of such an
   attempt. [We leave the above as in the second edition. Our present
   impression, however, is that a mixture of the liturgical system, with
   fixed forms, with the free extempore method, is not impracticable, and
   might yield better results than either separately. -- Note to third
   edition.]

   [100] The supposed subject of prayer in Luke xviii. is the general
   interest of the divine kingdom on the earth.

   [101] In Matt. vii. 11, which answers to Luke xi. 13, the phrase
   expressive of the object of desire is agatha, "good things.' instead of
   pneuma agion. The Pauline character of the latter expression has been
   remarked on, as one of many traces of the apostle's influence on the
   third Evangelist. The doctrine that the Holy Spirit is the immanent
   ground of Christian sanctity is emphatically Pauline. But the doctrine
   of gradual sanctification is not prominent in Paulinism.

   [102] Or "of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf,"
   as in R. V. The sense is the same.

   [103] See the Book of Job, passim, and Ps. lxxiii., lxxvii., etc.

   "Waiting for the Lord." -- Sermons, vol. 1.

7. LESSONS IN RELIGIOUS LIBERTY; OR, THE NATURE OF TRUE HOLINESS
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. FASTING

    Matt. 9:14-17; Mark 2:16-22; Luke 5:33-39.

   We have learnt in the last chapter how Jesus taught His disciples to
   pray, and we are now to learn in the present chapter how He taught them
   to live.

   Christ's ratio vivendi was characteristically simple; its main features
   being a disregard of minute mechanical rules, and a habit of falling
   back in all things on the great principles of morality and piety.

   The practical carrying out of this rule of life led to considerable
   divergence from prevailing custom. In three respects especially,
   according to the Gospel records, were our Lord and His disciples
   chargeable, and actually charged, with the offence of nonconformity.
   They departed from existing practice in the matters of fasting,
   ceremonial purifications as prescribed by the elders, and Sabbath
   sanctification. The first they neglected for the most part, the second
   altogether; the third they did not neglect, but their mode of observing
   the weekly rest was in spirit totally, and in detail widely, diverse
   from that which was in vogue.

   These divergences from established custom are historically interesting
   as the small beginnings of a great moral and religious revolution. For
   in teaching His disciples these new habits, Jesus was inaugurating a
   process of spiritual emancipation which was to issue in the complete
   deliverance of the apostles, and through them of the Christian church,
   from the burdensome yoke of Mosaic ordinances, and from the still more
   galling bondage of a "vain conversation received by tradition from the
   fathers."

   The divergences in question have much biographical interest also in
   connection with the religious experience of the twelve. For it is a
   solemn crisis in any man's life when he first departs in the most
   minute particulars from the religious opinions and practices of his
   age. The first steps in the process of change are generally the most
   difficult, the most perilous, and the most decisive. In these respects,
   learning spiritual freedom is like learning to swim. Every expert in
   the aquatic art remembers the troubles he experienced in connection
   with his first attempts, -- how hard he found it to make arms and legs
   keep stroke; how he floundered and plunged; how fearful he was lest he
   should go beyond his depth and sink to the bottom. At these early fears
   he may now smile, yet were they not altogether groundless; for the tyro
   does run some risk of drowning though the bathing-place be but a small
   pool or dam built by schoolboys on a burn flowing through an inland
   dell, remote from broad rivers and the great sea.

   It is well both for young swimmers and for apprentices in religious
   freedom when they make their first essays in the company of an
   experienced friend, who can rescue them should they be in danger. Such
   a friend the twelve had in Christ, whose presence was not only a
   safeguard against all inward spiritual risks, but a shield from all
   assaults which might come upon them from without. Such assaults were to
   be expected. Nonconformity invariably gives offence to many, and
   exposes the offending party to interrogation at least, and often to
   something more serious. Custom is a god to the multitude, and no one
   can withhold homage from the idol with impunity. The twelve accordingly
   did in fact incur the usual penalties connected with singularity. Their
   conduct was called in question, and censured, in every instance of
   departure from use and wont. Had they been left to themselves, they
   would have made a poor defence of the actions impugned; for they did
   not understand the principles on which the new practice was based, but
   simply did as they were directed. But in Jesus they had a friend who
   did understand those principles, and who was ever ready to assign good
   reasons for all He did Himself, and for all He taught His followers to
   do. The reasons with which he defended the twelve against the upholders
   of prevailing usage were specially good and telling; and they
   constitute, taken together, an apology for nonconformity not less
   remarkable than that which He made for graciously receiving publicans
   and sinners, [109] consisting, like it, of three lines of defence
   corresponding to the charges which had to be met. That apology we
   propose to consider in the present chapter under three divisions, in
   the first of which we take up the subject of fasting.

   From Matthew's account we learn that the conduct of Christ's disciples
   in neglecting fasting was animadverted on by the disciples of John the
   Baptist. "Then," we read, "came to Him the disciples of John" -- those,
   that is, who happened to be in the neighborhood -- "saying, Why do we
   and the Pharisees fast oft, but Thy disciples fast not?" [110] From
   this question we learn incidentally that in the matter of fasting the
   school of the Baptist and the sect of the Pharisees were agreed in
   their general practice. As Jesus told the Pharisees at a later date,
   John came in their own "way" of legal righteousness." [111] But it was
   a case of extremes meeting; for no two religious parties could be more
   remote in some respects than the two just named. But the difference lay
   rather in the motives than in the external acts of their religious
   life. Both did the same things -- fasted, practised ceremonial
   ablutions, made many prayers -- only they did them with a different
   mind. John and his disciples performed their religious duties in
   simplicity, godly sincerity, and moral earnestness; the Pharisees, as a
   class, did all their works ostentatiously, hypocritically, and as
   matters of mechanical routine.

   From the same question we further learn that the disciples of John, as
   well as the Pharisees, were very zealous in the practice of fasting.
   They fasted oft, much (pukna, Luke; polla, Matthew). This statement we
   otherwise know to be strictly true of such Pharisees as made great
   pretensions to piety. Besides the annual fast on the great day of
   atonement appointed by the law of Moses, and the four fasts which had
   become customary in the time of the Prophet Zechariah, in the fourth,
   fifth, seventh, and tenth months of the Jewish year, the stricter sort
   of Jews fasted twice every week, viz., on Mondays and Thursdays. [112]
   This bi-weekly fast is alluded to in the parable of the Pharisee and
   the publican.Luke xviii. 12. It is not to be assumed, of course, that
   the practice of the Baptist's disciples coincided in this respect with
   that of the strictest sect of the pharisaic party. Their system of
   fasting may have been organized on an independent plan, involving
   different arrangements as to times and occasions. The one fact known,
   which rests on the certain basis of their own testimony, is that, like
   the Pharisees, John's disciples fasted often, if not on precisely the
   same days and for the same reasons.

   It does not clearly appear what feelings prompted the question put by
   John's disciples to Jesus. It is not impossible that party spirit was
   at work, for rivalry and jealousy were not unknown, even in the
   environment of the forerunner.John iii. 26. In that case, the reference
   to pharisaic practice might be explained by a desire to overwhelm the
   disciples of Jesus by numbers, and put them, as it were, in a hopeless
   minority on the question. It is more likely, however, that the
   uppermost feeling in the mind of the interrogators was one of surprise,
   that in respect of fasting they should approach nearer to a sect whose
   adherents were stigmatized by their own master as a "generation of
   vipers," than to the followers of One for whom that master cherished
   and expressed the deepest veneration. In that case, the object of the
   question was to obtain information and instruction. It accords with
   this view that the query was addressed to Jesus. Had disputation been
   aimed at, the questioners would more naturally have applied to the
   disciples.

   If John's followers came seeking instruction, they were not
   disappointed. Jesus made a reply to their question, remarkable at once
   for originality, point, and pathos, setting forth in lively parabolic
   style the great principles by which the conduct of His disciples could
   be vindicated, and by which He desired the conduct of all who bore His
   name to be regulated. Of this reply it is to be observed, in the first
   place, that it is of a purely defensive character. Jesus does not blame
   John's disciples for fasting, but contents Himself with defending His
   own disciples for abstaining from fasting. He does not feel called on
   to disparage the one party in order to justify the other, but takes up
   the position of one who virtually says: "To fast may be right for you,
   the followers of John: not to fast is equally right for my followers."
   How grateful to Christ's feelings it must have been that He could
   assume this tolerant attitude on a question in which the name of John
   was mixed up! For He had a deep respect for the forerunner and his
   work, and ever spoke of him in most generous terms of appreciation; now
   calling him a burning and a shining lamp,John v. 35. and at another
   time declaring him not only a prophet but something more.Matt. xi. 7-15
   And we may remark in passing, that John reciprocated these kindly
   feelings, and had no sympathy with the petty jealousies in which his
   disciples sometimes indulged. The two great ones, both of them censured
   for different reasons by their degenerate contemporaries, ever spoke of
   each other to their disciples and to the public in terms of
   affectionate respect; the lesser light magnanimously confessing his
   inferiority, the greater magnifying the worth of His humble
   fellow-servant. What a refreshing contrast was thus presented to the
   mean passions of envy, prejudice, and detraction so prevalent in other
   quarters, under whose malign influence men of whom better things might
   have been expected spoke of John as a madman, and of Jesus as immoral
   and profane! [113]

   Passing from the manner to the matter of the reply, we notice that, for
   the purpose of vindicating His disciples, Jesus availed Himself of a
   metaphor suggested by a memorable word uttered concerning Himself at an
   earlier period by the master of those who now examined Him. To certain
   disciples who complained that men were leaving him and going to Jesus,
   John had said if effect: "Jesus is the Bridegroom, I am but the
   Bridegroom's friend; therefore it is right that men should leave me and
   join Jesus."John iii. 29. Jesus now takes up the Baptist's words, and
   turns them to account for the purpose of defending the way of life
   pursued by His disciples. His reply, freely paraphrased, is to this
   effect: "I am the Bridegroom, as your master said; it is right that the
   children of the bride-chamber come to me; and it is also right that,
   when they have come, they should adapt their mode of life to their
   altered circumstances. Therefore they do well not to fast, for fasting
   is the expression of sadness, and how should they be sad in my company?
   As well might men be sad at a marriage festival. The days will come
   when the children of the bride-chamber shall be sad, for the Bridegroom
   will not always be with them; and at the dark hour of His departure it
   will be natural and seasonable for them to fast, for then they shall be
   in a fasting mood -- weeping, lamenting, sorrowful, and disconsolate."

   The principle underlying this graphic representation is, that fasting
   should not be a matter of fixed mechanical rule, but should have
   reference to the state of mind; or, more definitely, that men should
   fast when they are sad, or in a state of mind akin to sadness --
   absorbed, pre-occupied -- as at some great solemn crisis in the life of
   an individual or a community, such as that in the history of Peter,
   when he was exercised on the great question of the admission of the
   Gentiles to the church, or such as that in the history of the Christian
   community at Antioch, when they were about to ordain the first
   missionaries to the heathen world. Christ's doctrine, clearly and
   distinctly indicated here, is that fasting in any other circumstances
   is forced, unnatural, unreal; a thing which men may be made to do as a
   matter of form, but which they do not with their heart and soul. "Can
   ye make the children of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is
   with them?" [114] He asked, virtually asserting that it was impossible.

   By this rule the disciples of our Lord were justified, and yet John's
   were not condemned. It was admitted to be natural for them to fast, as
   they were mournful, melancholy, unsatisfied. They had not found Him who
   was the Desire of all nations, the Hope of the future, the Bridegroom
   of the soul. They only knew that all was wrong; and in their querulous,
   despairing mood they took pleasure in fasting, and wearing coarse
   raiment, and frequenting lonely, desolate regions, living as hermits, a
   practical protest against an ungodly age. The message that the kingdom
   was at hand had indeed been preached to them also; but as proclaimed by
   John the announcement was awful news, not good news, and made them
   anxious and dispirited, not glad. Men in such a mood could not do
   otherwise than fast; though whether they did well to continue in that
   mood after the Bridegroom had come, and had been announced to them as
   such by their own master, is another matter. Their grief was wilful,
   idle, causeless, when He had appeared who was to take away the sin of
   the world.

   Jesus had yet more to say in reply to the questions addressed to Him.
   Things new and unusual need manifold apology, and therefore to the
   beautiful similitude of the children of the bride-chamber He added two
   other equally suggestive parables: those, viz., of the new patch on the
   old garment, and the new wine in old skins. The design of these
   parables is much the same as that of the first part of His reply, viz.,
   to enforce the law of congruity in relation to fasting and similar
   matters; that is, to show that in all voluntary religious service,
   where we are free to regulate our own conduct, the outward act should
   be made to correspond with the inward condition of mind, and that no
   attempt should be made to force particular acts or habits on men
   without reference to that correspondence. "In natural things," He meant
   to say, "we observe this law of congruity. No man putteth a piece of
   unfulled cloth [115] on an old garment. Neither do men put new wine
   into old skins, and that not merely out of regard to propriety, but to
   avoid bad consequences. For if the rule of congruity be neglected, the
   patched garment will be torn by the contraction of the new cloth; [116]
   and the old skin bottles will burst under the fermenting force of the
   new liquor, and the wine will be spilled and lost."

   The old cloth and old bottles in these metaphors represent old ascetic
   fashions in religion; the new cloth and the new wine represent the new
   joyful life in Christ, not possessed by those who tenaciously adhered
   to the old fashions. The parables were applied primarily to Christ's
   own age, but they admit of application to all transition epochs;
   indeed, they find new illustration in almost every generation.

   The force of these homely parables as arguments in vindication of
   departure from current usage in matters of religion may be evaded in
   either of two ways. First, their relevancy may be denied; i.e., it may
   be denied that religious beliefs are of such a nature as to demand
   congenial modes of expression, under penalties if the demand is not
   complied with. This position is usually assumed virtually or openly by
   the patrons of use and wont. Conservative minds have for the most part
   a very inadequate conception of the vital force of belief. Their own
   belief, their spiritual life altogether, is often a feeble thing, and
   they imagine tameness or pliancy must be an attribute of other men's
   faith also. Nothing but dire experience will convince them that they
   are mistaken; and when the proof comes in the shape of an irrepressible
   revolutionary outburst, they are stupefied with amazement. Such men
   learn nothing from the history of previous generations; for they
   persist in thinking that their own case will be an exception. Hence the
   vis inertiÃ¦ of established custom evermore insists on adherence to what
   is old, till the new wine proves its power by producing an explosion
   needlessly wasteful, by which both wine and bottles often perish, and
   energies which might have quietly wrought out a beneficent reformation
   are perverted into blind powers of indiscriminate destruction.

   Or, in the second place, the relevancy of these metaphors being
   admitted in general terms, it may be denied that a new wine (to borrow
   the form of expression from the second, more suggestive metaphor) has
   come into existence. This was virtually the attitude assumed by the
   Pharisees towards Christ. "What have you brought?" they asked Him in
   effect, "to your disciples, that they cannot live as others do, but
   must needs invent new religious habits for themselves? This new life of
   which you boast is either a vain pretence, or an illegitimate, spurious
   thing, not worthy of toleration, and the waste of which would be no
   matter for regret." Similar was the attitude assumed towards Luther by
   the opponents of the Reformation. They said to him in effect: "If this
   new revelation of yours, that sinners are justified by faith alone,
   were true, we admit that it would involve very considerable
   modification in religious opinion, and many alterations in religious
   practice. But we deny the truth of your doctrine, we regard the peace
   and comfort you find in it as a hallucination; and therefore we insist
   that you return to the time-honored faith, and then you will have no
   difficulty in acquiescing in the long-established practice." The same
   thing happens to a greater or less extent every generation; for new
   wine is always in course of being produced by the eternal vine of
   truth, demanding in some particulars of belief and practice new bottles
   for its preservation, and receiving for answer an order to be content
   with the old ones.

   Without going the length of denunciation or direct attempt at
   suppression, those who stand by the old often oppose the new by the
   milder method of disparagement. They eulogize the venerable past, and
   contrast it with the present, to the disadvantage of the latter." The
   old wine is vastly superior to the new: how mellow, mild, fragrant,
   wholesome, the one! how harsh and fiery the other!" Those who say so
   are not the worst of men: they are often the best, -- the men of taste
   and feeling, the gentle, the reverent, and the good, who are themselves
   excellent samples of the old vintage. Their opposition forms by far the
   most formidable obstacle to the public recognition and toleration of
   what is new in religious life; for it naturally creates a strong
   prejudice against any cause when the saintly disapprove of it.

   Observe, then, how Christ answers the honest admirers of the old wine.
   He concedes the point: He admits that their preference is natural. Luke
   represents Him as saying, in the conclusion of His reply to the
   disciples of the Baptist: "No man also, having drunk old wine, desireth
   the new; for he saith, The old is good." [117] This striking sentiment
   exhibits rare candor in stating the case of opponents, and not less
   rare modesty and tact in stating the case of friends. It is as if Jesus
   had said: "I do not wonder that you love the old wine of Jewish piety,
   fruit of a very ancient vintage; or even that you dote upon the very
   bottles which contain it, covered over with the dust and cobwebs of
   ages. But what then? Do men object to the existence of new wine, or
   refuse to have it in their possession, because the old is superior in
   flavor? No: they drink the old, but they carefully preserve the new,
   knowing that the old will get exhausted, and that the new, however
   harsh, will mend with age, and may ultimately be superior even in
   flavor to that which is in present use. Even so should you behave
   towards the new wine of my kingdom. You may not straightway desire it,
   because it is strange and novel; but surely you might deal more wisely
   with it than merely to spurn it, or spill and destroy it!"

   Too seldom for the church's good have lovers of old ways understood
   Christ's wisdom, and lovers of new ways sympathized with His charity. A
   celebrated historian has remarked: "It must make a man wretched, if,
   when on the threshold of old age, he looks on the rising generation
   with uneasiness, and does not rather rejoice in beholding it; and yet
   this is very common with old men. Fabius would rather have seen
   Hannibal unconquered than see his own fame obscured by Scipio." [118]
   There are always too many Fabii in the world, who are annoyed because
   things will not remain stationary, and because new ways and new men are
   ever rising up to take the place of the old. Not less rare, on the
   other hand, is Christ's charity among the advocates of progress. Those
   who affect freedom despise the stricter sort as fanatics and bigots,
   and drive on changes without regard to their scruples, and without any
   appreciation of the excellent qualities of the "old wine." When will
   young men and old men, liberals and conservatives, broad Christians and
   narrow, learn to bear with one another; yea, to recognize each in the
   other the necessary complement of his own one-sidedness?

  SECTION II. RITUAL ABLUTIONS

    Matt. xv. 1-20; Mark vii. 1-23; Luke xi. 37-41.

   The happy free society of Jesus, which kept bridal hightide when others
   fasted, was in this further respect singular in its manners, that its
   members took their meals unconcerned about existing usages of
   purification. They ate bread with "defiled, that is to say, with
   unwashen hands." Such was their custom, it may be assumed, from the
   beginning, though the practice does not appear to have become the
   subject of animadversion till an advanced period in the ministry of our
   Lord, [119] at least in a way that gave rise to incidents worthy of
   notice in the Gospel records. Even at the marriage in Cana, where were
   set six water-pots of stone for the purposes of purifying, Christ and
   His disciples are to be conceived as distinguished from the other
   guests by a certain inattention to ritual ablutions. This we infer from
   the reasons by which the neglect was defended when it was impugned,
   which virtually take up the position that the habit condemned was not
   only lawful, but incumbent -- a positive duty in the actual
   circumstances of Jewish society, and therefore, of course, a duty which
   could at no time be neglected by those who desired to please God rather
   than men. But indeed it needs no proof that one of such grave earnest
   spirit as Jesus could never have paid any regard to the trifling
   regulations about washing before eating invented by the "elders."

   These regulations were no trifles in the eyes of the Pharisees; and
   therefore we are not surprised to learn that the indifference with
   which they were treated by Jesus and the twelve provoked the censure of
   that zealous sect of religionists on at least two occasions, adverted
   to in the Gospel narratives. On one of these occasions, certain
   Pharisees and scribes, who had followed Christ from Jerusalem to the
   north, seeing some of His disciples eat without previously going
   through the customary ceremonial ablutions, came to Him, and asked,
   "Why walk not Thy disciples according to the traditions of the elders,
   but eat bread with unwashen hands?"Mark vii. 1, 2, 5. In the other
   instance Jesus Himself was the direct object of censure. "A certain
   Pharisee," Luke relates, "besought Jesus to dine with him; and He went
   in, and sat (directly) down to meat: and when the Pharisee saw it, he
   marvelled that He had not first washed before dinner." [120] Whether
   the host expressed his surprise by words or by looks only is not
   stated; but it was observed by his guest, and was made an occasion for
   exposing the vices of the pharisaic character. "Now," said the accused,
   in holy zeal for true purity, "now do ye Pharisees make clean the
   outside of the cup and platter, but your inward part is full of
   ravening and wickedness. Ye fools, did not He that made that which is
   without make that which is within also? But rather give alms of such
   things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you." [121]
   That is to say, the offending guest charged His scandalized host, and
   the sect he belonged to, with sacrificing inward to outward purity, and
   at the same time taught the important truth that to the pure all things
   are pure, and showed the way by which inward real purity was to be
   reached, viz., by the practice of that sadly neglected virtue, humanity
   or charity.

   The Lord's reply in the other encounter with pharisaic adversaries on
   the subject of washings was similar in its principle, but different in
   form. He told the zealots for purifications, without periphrasis, that
   they were guilty of the grave offence of sacrificing the commandments
   of God to the commandments of men -- to these pet traditions of the
   elders. The statement was no libel, but a simple melancholy fact,
   though its truth does not quite lie on the surface. This we hope to
   show in the following remarks; but before we proceed to that task, we
   must force ourselves, however reluctantly, to acquire a little better
   acquaintance with the contemptible senilities whose neglect once seemed
   so heinous a sin to persons deeming themselves holy.

   The aim of the rabbinical prescriptions respecting washings was not
   physical cleanliness, but something thought to be far higher and more
   sacred. Their object was to secure, not physical, but ceremonial
   purity; that is, to cleanse the person from such impurity as might be
   contracted by contact with a Gentile, or with a Jew in a ceremonially
   unclean state, or with an unclean animal, or with a dead body or any
   part thereof. To the regulations in the law of Moses respecting such
   uncleanness the rabbis added a vast number of additional rules on their
   own responsibility, in a self-willed zeal for the scrupulous observance
   of the Mosaic precepts. They issued their commandments, as the Church
   of Rome has issued hers, under the pretext that they were necessary as
   means towards the great end of fulfilling strictly the commandments of
   God.

   The burdens laid on men's shoulders by the scribes on this plausible
   ground were, by all accounts, indeed most grievous. Not content with
   purifications prescribed in the law for uncleanness actually
   contracted, they made provision for merely possible cases. If a man did
   not remain at home all day, but went out to market, he must wash his
   hands on his return, because it was possible that he might have touched
   some person or thing ceremonially unclean. Great care, it appears, had
   also to be taken that the water used in the process of ablution was
   itself perfectly pure; and it was necessary even to apply the water in
   a particular manner to the hands, in order to secure the desired
   result. Without travelling beyond the sacred record, we find, in the
   items of information supplied by Mark respecting prevailing Jewish
   customs of purification, enough to show to what ridiculous lengths this
   momentous business of washing was carried. "Many other things," remarks
   he quaintly, and not without a touch of quiet satire, "there be which
   they have received to hold, as the washing of cups and pots, brazen
   vessels, and of tables." [122] All things, in short, used in connection
   with food -- in cooking it, or in placing it on the table -- had to be
   washed, not merely as people might wash them now to remove actual
   impurity, but to deliver them from the more serious uncleanness which
   they might possibly have contracted since last used, by touching some
   person or thing not technically clean. A kind and measure of purity, in
   fact, were aimed at incompatible with life in this world. The very air
   of heaven was not clean enough for the doting patrons of patristic
   traditions; for, not to speak of other more real sources of
   contamination, the breeze, in blowing over Gentile lands to the sacred
   land of Jewry, had contracted defilement which made it unfit to pass
   into ritualistic lungs till it had been sifted by a respirator
   possessing the magic power to cleanse it from its pollution.

   The extravagant fanatical zeal of the Jews in these matters is
   illustrated in the Talmud by stories which, although belonging to a
   later age, may be regarded as a faithful reflection of the spirit which
   animated the Pharisees in the time of our Lord. Of these stories the
   following is a sample: "Rabbi Akiba was thrown by the Christians into
   prison, and Rabbi Joshua brought him every day as much water as
   sufficed both for washing and for drinking. But on one occasion it
   happened that the keeper of the prison got the water to take in, and
   spilled the half of it. Akiba saw that there was too little water, but
   nevertheless said, Give me the water for my hands. His brother rabbi
   replied, My master, you have not enough for drinking. But Akiba
   replied, He who eats with unwashed hands perpetrates a crime that ought
   to be punished with death. Better for me to die of thirst than to
   transgress the traditions of my ancestors." [123] Rabbi Akiba would
   rather break the sixth commandment, and be guilty of self-murder, than
   depart from the least punctilio of a fantastic ceremonialism;
   illustrating the truth of the declaration made by Christ in His reply
   to the Pharisees, which we now proceed to consider.

   It was not to be expected that, in defending His disciples from the
   frivolous charge of neglecting the washing of hands, Jesus would show
   much respect for their accusers. Accordingly, we observe a marked
   difference between the tone of His reply in the present case, and that
   of His answer to John's disciples. Towards them the attitude assumed
   was respectfully defensive and apologetic; towards the present
   interrogants the attitude assumed is offensive and denunciatory. To
   John's disciples Jesus said, "Fasting is right for you: not to fast is
   equally right for my disciples." To the Pharisees He replies by a
   retort which at once condemns their conduct and justifies the behavior
   which they challenged. "Why," ask they, "do Thy disciples transgress
   the traditions of the elders?" "Why," asked He in answer, "do ye also
   transgress the commandments of God by your traditions?" as if to say,
   "It becomes not you to judge; you, who see the imaginary mote in the
   eye of a brother, have a beam in your own."

   This spirited answer was something more than a mere retort or et tu
   quoque argument. Under an interrogative form it enunciated a great
   principle, viz., that the scrupulous observance of human traditions in
   matters of practice leads by a sure path to a corresponding negligence
   and unscrupulousness in reference to the eternal laws of God. Hence
   Christ's defence of His disciples was in substance this: "I and my
   followers despise and neglect those customs because we desire to keep
   the moral law. Those washings, indeed, may not seem seriously to
   conflict with the great matters of the law, but to be at worst only
   trifling and contemptible. But the case is not so. To treat trifles as
   serious matters, as matters of conscience, which ye do, is degrading
   and demoralizing. No man can do that without being or becoming a moral
   imbecile, or a hypocrite: either one who is incapable of discerning
   between what is vital and what not in morals, or one who finds his
   interest in getting trifles, such as washing of hands, or paying tithe
   of herbs, to be accepted as the important matters, and the truly great
   things of the law -- justice, mercy, and faith -- quietly pushed aside
   as if they were of no moment whatever."

   The whole history of religion proves the truth of these views. A
   ceremony and tradition ridden time is infallibly a morally corrupt
   time. Hypocrites ostensibly zealots, secretly atheists; profligates
   taking out their revenge in licentiousness for having been compelled,
   by tyrannous custom or intolerant ecclesiastical authorities, to
   conform outwardly to practices for which they have no respect; priests
   of the type of the sons of Eli, gluttonous, covetous, wanton: such are
   the black omens of an age in which ceremonies are every thing, and
   godliness and virtue nothing. Ritualistic practices, artificial duties
   of all kinds, whether originating with Jewish rabbis or with doctors of
   the Christian church, are utterly to be abjured. Recommended by their
   zealous advocates, often sincerely, as eminently fitted to promote the
   culture of morality and piety, they ever prove, in the long run, fatal
   to both. Well are they called in the Epistle to the Hebrews "dead
   works." They are not only dead, but death-producing; for, like all dead
   things, they tend to putrefy, and to breed a spiritual pestilence which
   sweeps thousands of souls into perdition. If they have any life at all,
   it is life feeding on death, the life of fungi growing on dead trees;
   if they have any beauty, it is the beauty of decay, of autumnal leaves
   sere and yellow, when the sap is descending down to the earth, and the
   woods are about to pass into their winter state of nakedness and
   desolation. Ritualism at its best is but the shortlived after-summer of
   the spiritual year! very fascinating it may be, but when it cometh, be
   sure winter is at the doors. "We all do fade as a leaf, and our
   iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away."

   Having brought a grave countercharge against the Pharisees, that of
   sacrificing morality to ceremonies, the commandments of God to the
   traditions of men, Jesus proceeded forthwith to substantiate it by a
   striking example and a Scripture quotation. The example selected was
   the evasion of the duties arising out of the fifth commandment, under
   pretence of a previous religious obligation. God said, "Honor thy
   father and mother," and attached to a breach of the commandment the
   penalty of death. The Jewish scribes said, "Call a thing Corban, and
   you will be exempt from all obligation to give it away, even for the
   purpose of assisting needy parents." The word Corban in the Mosaic law
   signifies a gift or offering to God, of any kind, bloody or bloodless,
   presented on any occasion, as in the fulfilment of a vow. [124] In
   rabbinical dialect it signified a thing devoted to sacred purposes, and
   therefore not available for private or secular use. The traditional
   doctrine on the subject of Corban was mischievous in two ways. It
   encouraged men to make religion an excuse for neglecting morality, and
   it opened a wide door to knavery and hypocrisy. It taught that a man
   might not only by a vow deny himself the use of things lawful, but that
   he might, by devoting a thing to God, relieve himself of all obligation
   to give to others what, but for the vow, it would have been his duty to
   give them. Then, according to the pernicious system of the rabbis, it
   was not necessary really to give the thing to God in order to be free
   of obligation to give it to man. It was enough to call it Corban. Only
   pronounce that magic word over any thing, and forthwith it was sealed
   over to God, and sacred from the use of others at least, if not from
   your own use. Thus self-willed zeal for the honor of God led to the
   dishonoring of God, by taking His name in vain; and practices which at
   best were chargeable with setting the first table of the law over
   against the second, proved eventually to be destructive of both tables.
   They made the whole law of God of none effect by their traditions. The
   disannulling of the fifth commandment was but a sample of the mischief
   the zealots for the commandments of men had wrought, as is implied in
   Christ's concluding words, "Many such like things do ye." [125]

   The Scripture quotation [126] made by our Lord in replying to the
   Pharisees was not less apt than the example was illustrative, as
   pointing out their characteristic vices, hypocrisy and superstition.
   They were near to God with their mouth, they honored Him with their
   lips, but they were far from Him in their hearts. Their religion was
   all on the outside. They scrupulously washed their hands and their
   cups, but they took no care to cleanse their polluted souls. Then, in
   the second place, their fear of God was taught by the precept of men.
   Human prescriptions and traditions were their guide in religion, which
   they followed blindly, heedless how far these commandments of men might
   lead them from the paths of righteousness and true godliness.

   The prophetic word was quick, powerful, sharp, searching, and
   conclusive. Nothing more was needed to confound the Pharisees, and
   nothing more was said to them at this time. The sacred oracle was the
   fitting conclusion of an unanswerable argument against the patrons of
   tradition. But Jesus had compassion on the poor multitude who were
   being misled to their ruin by their blind spiritual guides, and
   therefore He took the opportunity of addressing a word to those who
   stood around on the subject of dispute. What He had to say to them He
   expressed in the terse, pointed form of a proverb: "Hear and
   understand: not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but
   that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man." This was a
   riddle to be solved, a secret of wisdom to be searched out, a lesson in
   religion to be conned. Its meaning, though probably understood by few
   at the moment, was very plain. It was simply this: "Pay most attention
   to the cleansing of the heart, not, like the Pharisees, to the
   cleansing of the hands. When the heart is pure, all is pure; when the
   heart is impure, all outward purification is vain. The defilement to be
   dreaded is not that from meat ceremonially unclean, but that which
   springs from a carnal mind, the defilement of evil thoughts, evil
   passions, evil habits."

   This passing word to the bystanders became the subject of a subsequent
   conversation between Jesus and His disciples, in which He took occasion
   to justify Himself for uttering it, and explained to them its meaning.
   The Pharisees had heard the remark, and were naturally offended by it,
   as tending to weaken their authority over the popular conscience. The
   twelve observed their displeasure, perhaps they overheard their
   comments; and, fearing evil consequences, they came and informed their
   Master, probably with a tone which implied a secret regret that the
   speaker had not been less outspoken. Be that as it may, Jesus gave them
   to understand that it was not a case for forbearance, compromise, or
   timid, time-serving, prudential policy; the ritualistic tendency being
   an evil plant which must be uprooted, no matter with what offence to
   its patrons. He pleaded, in defence of His plainness of speech, His
   concern for the souls of the ignorant people whose guides the Pharisees
   claimed to be. "Let them alone, what would follow? Why, the blind
   leaders and the blindly led would fall together into the ditch.
   Therefore if the leaders be so hopelessly wedded to their errors that
   they cannot be turned from them, let us at least try to save their
   comparatively ignorant victims."

   The explanation of the proverbial word spoken to the people Jesus gave
   to His disciples by request of Peter. [127] It is rudely plain and
   particular, because addressed to rudely ignorant hearers. It says over
   again, in the strongest possible language, that to eat with unwashen
   hands defileth not a man, because nothing entering the mouth can come
   near the soul; that the defilement to be dreaded, the only defilement
   worth speaking of, is that of an evil, unrenewed heart, out of which
   proceed thoughts, words, and acts which are offences against the holy,
   pure law of God. The concluding words, "purging all meats," have,
   however, a peculiar significance, if we adopt the reading approved by
   critics: "This He said, purging all meats." In that case we have the
   evangelist giving his own opinion of the effect of Christ's words,
   viz., that they amounted to an abrogation of the ceremonial distinction
   between clean and unclean. A very remarkable comment, as coming from
   the man to whom we are indebted for the report of the preaching of that
   apostle who in his disciple days called forth the declaration, and who
   had the vision of the sheet let down from heaven.

   The evangelist having given us his comment, we may add ours. We observe
   that our Lord is here silent concerning the ceremonial law of Moses (to
   which the traditions of the elders were a supplement), and speaks only
   of the commandments of God, i. e. the precepts of the decalogue. The
   fact is significant, as showing in what direction He had come to
   destroy, and in what to fulfil. Ceremonialism was to be abolished, and
   the eternal laws of morality were to become all in all. Men's
   consciences were to be delivered from the burden of outward positive
   ordinances, that they might be free to serve the living God, by keeping
   His ten words, or the one royal law of love. And it is the duty of the
   church to stand fast in the liberty Christ designed and purchased for
   her, and to be jealous of all human traditions out of holy zeal for the
   divine will, shunning superstition on the one side, and the licentious
   freedom of godless libertinism on the other. Christ's true followers
   wish to be free, but not to do as they like; rather to do what God
   requires of them. So minded, they reject unceremoniously all human
   authority in religion, thereby separating themselves from the devotees
   to tradition; and at the same time, as God's servants, they reverence
   His word and His law, thereby putting a wide gulf between them and the
   lawless and disobedient, who side with movements of religious reform,
   not in order to get something better in the place of what is rejected,
   but to get rid of all moral restraint in matters human or divine.

  SECTION III. SABBATH OBSERVANCE

    Matt. xii. 1-14; Mark ii. 23-28; Mark iii. 1-6; Luke vi. 1-11; xiii. 10-16;
    xiv. 1-6; John v. 1-18; ix. 13-17.

   In no part of their conduct were Jesus and His disciples more
   frequently found fault with than in respect to their mode of observing
   the Sabbath. Six distinct instances of offence given or taken on this
   score are recorded in the Gospel history; in five of which Jesus
   Himself was the offender, while in the remaining instance His disciples
   were at least the ostensible objects of censure.

   The offences of Jesus were all of one sort; His crime was, that on the
   Sabbath-day He wrought works of healing on the persons of men afflicted
   respectively with palsy, a withered hand, blindness, dropsy, and on the
   body of a poor woman "bowed together" by an infirmity of eighteen
   years' standing. The offence of the disciples, on the other hand, was
   that, while walking along a way which lay through a corn-field, they
   stepped aside and plucked some ears of grain for the purpose of
   satisfying their hunger. This was not theft, for it was permitted by
   the law of Moses; [128] but nevertheless it was, in the judgment of the
   Pharisees, Sabbath-breaking. It was contrary to the command, "Thou
   shalt not work;." for to pluck some ears was reaping on a small scale,
   and to rub them was a species of threshing!

   These offences, deemed so grave when committed, seem very small at this
   distance. All the transgressions of the Sabbath law charged against
   Jesus were works of mercy; and the one transgression of the disciples
   was for them a work of necessity, and the toleration of it was for
   others a duty of mercy, so that in condemning them the Pharisees had
   forgotten that divine word: "I will have mercy, and not sacrifice." It
   is, indeed, hard for us now to conceive how any one could be serious in
   regarding such actions as breaches of the Sabbath, especially the
   harmless act of the twelve. There is a slight show of plausibility in
   the objection taken by the ruler of the synagogue to miraculous cures
   wrought on the seventh day: "There are six days on which men ought to
   work; in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the
   Sabbath-day." [129] The remark was specially plausible with reference
   to the case which had provoked the ire of the dignitary of the
   synagogue. A woman who had been a sufferer for eighteen years might
   surely bear her trouble one day more, and come and be healed on the
   morrow! But on what pretence could the disciples be blamed as
   Sabbath-breakers for helping themselves to a few ears of corn? To call
   such an act working was too ridiculous. Men who found a Sabbatic
   offence here must have been very anxious to catch the disciples of
   Jesus in a fault.

   On the outlook for faults we have no doubt the Pharisees were; and yet
   we must admit that, in condemning the act referred to, they were acting
   faithfully in accordance with their theoretical views and habitual
   tendencies. Their judgment on the conduct of the twelve was in keeping
   with their traditions concerning washings, and their tithing of mint
   and other garden herbs, and their straining of gnats out of their
   wine-cup. Their habit, in all things, was to degrade God's law by
   framing innumerable petty rules for its better observance, which,
   instead of securing that end, only made the law appear base and
   contemptible. In no case was this miserable micrology carried greater
   lengths than in connection with the fourth commandment. With a most
   perverse ingenuity, the most insignificant actions were brought within
   the scope of the prohibition against labor. Even in the case put by our
   Lord, that of an animal fallen into a pit, it was deemed lawful to lift
   it out -- so at least those learned in rabbinical lore tell us -- only
   when to leave it there till Sabbath was past would involve risk to
   life. When delay was not dangerous, the rule was to give the beast food
   sufficient for the day; and if there was water in the bottom of the
   pit, to place straw and bolsters below it, that it might not be
   drowned. [130]

   Yet with all their strictness in abstaining from every thing bearing
   the faintest resemblance to work, the Jews were curiously lax in
   another direction. While scrupulously observing the law which
   prohibited the cooking of food on Sabbath, [131] they did not make the
   holy day by any means a day of fasting. On the contrary, they
   considered it their duty to make the Sabbath a day of feasting and good
   cheer. [132] In fact, it was at a Sabbath feast, given by a chief man
   among the Pharisees, that one of the Sabbath miracles was wrought for
   which Jesus was put upon His defence. At this feast were numerous
   guests, Jesus Himself being one, -- invited, it is to be feared, with
   no friendly feelings, but rather in the hope of finding something
   against Him concerning the Sabbatic law. "It came to pass," we read in
   Luke, "as He (Jesus) went into the house of one of the rulers of the
   Pharisees to eat bread on a Sabbath-day, that they were watching Him.
   [133] They set a trap, and hoped to catch in it Him whom they hated
   without cause; and they got for their pains such searching, humbling
   table-talk as they had probably never heard before. [134] This habit of
   feasting had grown to a great abuse in the days of Augustine, as
   appears from the description he gives of the mode in which contemporary
   Jews celebrated their weekly holiday. "To-day," he writes, "is the
   Sabbath, which the Jews at the present time keep in loose, luxurious
   ease, for they occupy their leisure in frivolity; and whereas God
   commanded a Sabbath, they spend it in those things which God forbids.
   Our rest is from evil works, theirs is from good works; for it is
   better to plough than to dance. They rest from good work, they rest not
   from idle work." [135]

   From the folly and pedantry of scribes and Pharisees we gladly turn to
   the wisdom of Jesus, as revealed in the animated, deep, and yet
   sublimely simple replies made by Him to the various charges of
   Sabbath-breaking brought against Himself and His disciples. Before
   considering these replies in detail, we premise one general remark
   concerning them all. In none of these apologies or defences does Jesus
   call in question the obligation of the Sabbath law. On that point He
   had no quarrel with His accusers. His argument in this instance is
   entirely different from the line of defence adopted in reference to
   fasting and purifications. In regard to fasting, the position He took
   up was: Fasting is a voluntary matter, and men may fast or not as they
   are disposed. In regard to purification His position was: Ceremonial
   ablutions at best are of secondary moment, being mere types of inward
   purity, and as practised now, lead inevitably to the utter ignoring of
   spiritual purity, and therefore must be neglected by all who are
   concerned for the great interests of morality. But in reference to the
   alleged breaches of the Sabbath, the position Jesus took up was this:
   These acts which you condemn are not transgressions of the law, rightly
   apprehended, in its spirit and principle. The importance of the law was
   conceded, but the pharisaic interpretation of its meaning was rejected.
   An appeal was made from their pedantic code of regulations about
   Sabbath observance to the grand design and principle of the law; and
   the right was asserted to examine all rules in the light of the
   principle, and to reject or disregard those in which the principle had
   either been mistakenly applied, or, as was for the most part the case
   with the Pharisees, lost sight of altogether.

   The key to all Christ's teaching on the Sabbath, therefore, lies in His
   conception of the original design of that divine institution. This
   conception we find expressed with epigrammatic point and conciseness,
   in contrast to the pharisaic idea of the Sabbath, in words uttered by
   Jesus on the occasion when He was defending His disciples. "The
   Sabbath," said He, "was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." In
   other words, His doctrine was this: The Sabbath was meant to be a boon
   to man, not a burden; it was not a day taken from man by God in an
   exacting spirit, but a day given by God in mercy to man -- God's
   holiday to His subjects; all legislation enforcing its observance
   having for its end to insure that all should really get the benefit of
   the boon -- that no man should rob himself, and still less his
   fellow-creatures, of the gracious boon.

   This difference between Christ's mode of regarding the Sabbath and the
   pharisaic involves of necessity a corresponding difference in the
   spirit and the details of its observance. Take Christ's view, and your
   principle becomes: That is the best way of observing the Sabbath which
   is most conducive to man's physical and spiritual well-being -- in
   other words, which is best for his body and for his soul; and in the
   light of this principle, you will keep the holy day in a spirit of
   intelligent joy and thankfulness to God the Creator for His gracious
   consideration towards His creatures. Take the pharisaic view, and your
   principle of observance becomes: He best keeps the Sabbath who goes
   greatest lengths in mere abstinence from any thing that can be
   construed into labor, irrespective of the effect of this abstinence
   either on his own well-being or on that of others. In short, we land in
   the silly, senseless minuteness of a rabbinical legislation, which sees
   in such an act as that of the disciples plucking and rubbing the ears
   of corn, or that of the healed man who carried his bed home on his
   shoulders, [136] or that of one who should walk a greater distance than
   two thousand cubits, or three-fourths of a mile, [137] on a Sabbath, a
   heinous offence against the fourth commandment and its Author.

   A Sabbath observance regulated by the principle that the institution
   was made for man's good, obviously involves two great general uses --
   rest for the body, and worship as the solace of the spirit. We should
   rest from servile labor on the divinely given holiday, and we should
   lift up our hearts in devout thought to Him who made all things at the
   first, who "worketh hitherto," preserving the creation in being and
   well-being, and whose tender compassion towards sinful men is great,
   passing knowledge. These things are both necessary to man's true good,
   and therefore must enter as essential elements of a worthy Sabbath
   observance.

   But, on the other hand, the Sabbath being made for man, the two general
   requirements of rest and worship may not be so pressed that they shall
   become hostile to man's well-being, and in effect self-destructive, or
   mutually destructive. The rule, "Thou shalt rest," must not be so
   applied as to exclude all action and all work; for absolute inaction is
   not rest, and entire abstinence from work of every description would
   often-times be detrimental both to private and to public well-being.
   Room must be left for acts of "necessity and mercy;." and too
   peremptory as well as too minute legislation as to what are and what
   are not acts of either description must be avoided, as these may vary
   for different persons, times, and circumstances, and men may honestly
   differ in opinion in such details who are perfectly loyal to the great
   broad principles of Sabbath sanctification. In like manner, the rule,
   "Thou shalt worship," must not be so enforced as to make religious
   duties irksome and burdensome -- a mere mechanical, legal service; or
   so as to involve the sacrifice of the other great practical end of the
   Sabbath, viz., rest to the animal nature of man. Nor may men dictate to
   each other as to the means of worship any more than as to the amount;
   for one may find helps to devotion in means which to another would
   prove a hindrance and a distraction.

   It was only in regard to cessation from work that pharisaic legislation
   and practice anent Sabbath observance were carried to superstitious and
   vexatious excess. The Sabbatic mania was a monomania, those affected
   thereby being mad simply on one point, the stringent enforcement of
   rest. Hence the peculiar character of all the charges brought against
   Christ and His disciples, and also of His replies. The offences
   committed were all works deemed unlawful; and the defences all went to
   show that the works done were not contrary to law when the law was
   interpreted in the light of the principle that the Sabbath was made for
   man. They were works of necessity or of mercy, and therefore lawful on
   the Sabbath-day.

   Jesus drew His proofs of this position from three sources: Scripture
   history, the everyday practice of the Pharisees themselves, and the
   providence of God. In defence of His disciples, He referred to the case
   of David eating the shewbread when he fled to the house of God from the
   court of King Saul, [138] and to the constant practice of the priests
   in doing work for the service of the temple on Sabbath-days, such as
   offering double burnt-offerings, and removing the stale shewbread from
   the holy place, and replacing it by hot loaves. David's case proved the
   general principle that necessity has no law, hunger justifying his act,
   as it should also have justified the act of the disciples even in
   pharisaic eyes. The practice of the priests showed that work merely as
   work is not contrary to the law of the Sabbath, some works being not
   only lawful, but incumbent on that day.

   The argument drawn by Jesus from common practice was well fitted to
   silence captious critics, and to suggest the principle by which His own
   conduct could be defended. It was to this effect: "You would lift an ox
   or an ass out of a pit on Sabbath, would you not? Why? To save life?
   Why then should not I heal a sick person for the same reason? Or is a
   beast's life of more importance than that of a human being? Or again:
   Would you scruple to loose you ox or your ass from the stall on the day
   of rest, and lead him away to watering? [139] If not, why object to me
   when on the Sabbath-day I release a poor human victim from a bondage of
   eighteen years' duration, that she may draw water out of the wells of
   salvation?" The argument is irresistible, the conclusion inevitable;
   that it is lawful, dutiful, most seasonable, to do well on the
   Sabbath-day. How blind they must have been to whom so obvious a
   proposition needed to be proved! how oblivious of the fact that love is
   the foundation and fulfilment of all law, and that therefore no
   particular precept could ever be meant to suspend the operation of that
   divine principle!

   The argument from providence used by Jesus on another occasion [140]
   was designed to serve the same purpose with the others, viz., to show
   the lawfulness of certain kinds of work on the day of rest. "My Father
   worketh even until now," said He to His accusers, "and I work." The Son
   claimed the right to work because and as the Father worked on all days
   of the week. The Father worked incessantly for beneficent, conservative
   ends, most holily, wisely, and powerfully preserving and governing all
   His creatures and all their actions, keeping the planets in their
   orbits, causing the sun to rise and shine, and the winds to circulate
   in their courses, and the tides to ebb and flow on the seventh day as
   on all the other six. So Jesus Christ, the son of God, claimed the
   right to work, and did work -- saving, restoring, healing; as far as
   might be bringing fallen nature back to its pristine state, when God
   the Creator pronounced all things good, and rested,, satisfied with the
   world He had brought into being. Such works of beneficence, by the
   doctrine of Christ, may always be done on the Sabbath-day: works of
   humanity, like those of the physician, or of the teacher of neglected
   children, or of the philanthropist going his rounds among the poor and
   needy, or of the Christian minister preaching the gospel of peace, and
   many others, of which men filled with love will readily bethink
   themselves, but whereof too many, in the coldness of their heart, do
   not so much as dream. Against such works there is no law save that of
   churlish, ungenial, pharisaic custom.

   One other saying our Lord uttered on the present subject, which carries
   great weight for Christians, though it can have had no apologetic value
   in the opinion of the Pharisees, but must rather have appeared an
   aggravation of the offence it was meant to excuse. We refer to the
   word, "The Son of man is Lord even of the Sabbath-day," uttered by
   Jesus on the occasion when He defended His disciples against the charge
   of Sabbath-breaking. This statement, remarkable, like the claim made at
   the same time to be greater than the temple, as an assertion of
   superhuman dignity on the part of the meek and lowly One, was not meant
   as a pretension to the right to break the law of rest without cause, or
   to abrogate it altogether. This is evident from Mark's account, [141]
   where the words come in as an inference from the proposition that the
   Sabbath was made for man, which could not logically be made the
   foundation for a repeal of the statute, seeing it is the most powerful
   argument for the perpetuity of the weekly rest. Had the Sabbath been a
   mere burdensome restriction imposed on men, we should have expected its
   abrogation from Him who came to redeem men from all sorts of bondage.
   But was the Sabbath made for man -- for man's good? Then should we
   expect Christ's function to be not that of a repealer, but that of a
   universal philanthropic legislator, making what had previously been the
   peculiar privilege of Israel a common blessing to all mankind. For the
   Father sent His Son into the world to deliver men indeed from the yoke
   of ordinances, but not to cancel any of His gifts, which are all
   "without repentance," and, once given, can never be withdrawn.

   What, then, does the lordship of Christ over the Sabbath signify?
   Simply this: that an institution which is of the nature of a boon to
   man properly falls under the control of Him who is the King of grace
   and the administrator of divine mercy. He is the best judge how such an
   institution should be observed; and He has a right to see that it shall
   not be perverted from a boon into a burden, and so put in antagonism to
   the royal imperial law of love. The Son of man hath authority to cancel
   all regulations tending in this direction emanating from men, and even
   all by-laws of the Mosaic code savoring of legal rigor, and tending to
   veil the beneficent design of the fourth commandment of the decalogue.
   [142] He may, in the exercise of His mediatorial prerogative, give the
   old institution a new name, alter the day of its celebration, so as to
   invest it with distinctively Christian associations congenial to the
   hearts of believers, and make it in all the details of its observance
   subservient to the great ends of His incarnation.

   To such effect did the Son of man claim to be Lord of the Sabbath-day;
   and His claim, so understood, was acknowledged by the church, when,
   following the traces of the apostolic usage, she changed the weekly
   rest from the seventh day to the first, [143] that it might commemorate
   the joyful event of the resurrection of the Saviour, which lay nearer
   the heart of a believer than the old event of the creation, and called
   the first day by His name, the Lord's day. [144] That claim all
   Christians acknowledge who, looking at the day in the light of God's
   original design, and of Christ's teaching, example and work, so observe
   it as to keep the golden mean between the two extremes of pharisaic
   rigor and of Sadducaic laxity: recognizing on the one hand the
   beneficent ends served by the institution, and doing their utmost to
   secure that these ends shall be fully realized, and, on the other hand,
   avoiding the petty scrupulosity of a cheerless legalism, which causes
   many, especially among the young, to stumble at the law as a statute of
   unreasonable arbitrary restriction; avoiding also the bad pharisaic
   habit of indulging in over-confident judgments on difficult points of
   detail, and on the conduct of those who in such points do not think and
   act as they do themselves.

   We may not close this chapter, in which we have been studying the
   lessons in free yet holy living given by our Lord to His disciples,
   without adding a reflection applicable to all the three. By these
   lessons the twelve were taught a virtue very necessary for the apostles
   of a religion in many respects new -- the power to bear isolation and
   its consequences. When Peter and John appeared before the Sanhedrim,
   the rulers marvelled at their boldness, till they recognized in them
   companions of Jesus the Nazarene. They seem to have imagined that His
   followers were fit for any thing requiring audacity. They were right.
   The apostles had strong nerves, and were not easily daunted; and the
   lessons which we have been considering help us to understand whence
   they got their rare moral courage. They had been accustomed for years
   to stand alone, and to disregard the fashion of the world, till at
   length they could do what was right, heedless of human criticism,
   without effort, almost without thought.

   [142] The position of the Sabbath in the decalogue (where nothing is
   placed which was of merely Jewish concern, and which was not of
   fundamental importance) is a presumption of perpetuity for every candid
   mind. The much disputed question of the ethical nature of the Sabbath
   law is not of so great moment as has been imagined. Moral or not, the
   weekly rest is to all men, and at all times, of vital importance;
   therefore practically, if not philosophically, of ethical value. The
   fourth commandment certainly differs from the others in this respect,
   that it is not written on the natural conscience. The utmost length
   reason could go would be to determine that rest is needful. Whether
   rest should be periodical or at irregular intervals, on the seventh day
   or on the tenth, as in revolutionary France, with its mania for the
   decimal system, the light of nature could not teach. But the decalogue
   settles that point, and settles it forever, for all who believe in the
   divine origin of the Mosaic legislation. The fourth commandment is a
   revelation for all time of God's mind on the universally important
   question of the proper relation between labor and rest.

   [143] How this change was brought about we do not well know. Probably
   it was accomplished by degrees, and without full consciousness of the
   transition which was being made, or of its import. From the beginning
   believers seem to have met for worship on the first day of the week;
   but there is no evidence that they rested entirely from work on that
   day. In many cases they could not have done so if they wished, e.g. in
   the case of slaves of heathen masters. Hence, probably, we account for
   the church in Troas meeting in the evening, and worshipping till
   midnight. The likelihood is that the first Christians rested on the
   seventh day as the Jews, and as Christians worshipped on the morning or
   evening of the first day, before or after their daily toil. In course
   of time, as Jewish believers became more weaned from Judaism, the
   Gentile worshippers multiplied, so as to have a preponderating
   influence on the customs of the church, the seventh-day rest would
   disappear, and the first-day rest, the Lord's day, would take its
   place. To prevent misapprehension, it is necessary to explain that the
   seventh day continued to be observed as a fast-day or a festival, with
   religious services, long after it had ceased to be regarded as a day on
   which men ought entirely to rest from labor. Vide on this, Bingham,

8. FIRST ATTEMPTS AT EVANGELISM
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. THE MISSION

    Matt. 10; Mark 6:7-13, 30-32; Luke 9:1-11.

   The twelve are now to come before us as active agents in advancing the
   kingdom of God. Having been for some time in Christ's company,
   witnessing His miraculous works, hearing His doctrine concerning the
   kingdom, and learning how to pray and how to live, they were at length
   sent forth to evangelize the towns and villages of their native
   province, and to heal the sick in their Master's name, and by His
   power. This mission of the disciples as evangelists or miniature
   apostles was partly, without doubt, an educational experiment for their
   own benefit; but its direct design was to meet the spiritual
   necessities of the people, whose neglected condition lay heavy on
   Christ's heart. The compassionate Son of man, in the course of His
   wanderings, had observed how the masses of the population were, like a
   shepherdless flock of sheep, scattered and torn, [145] and it was His
   desire that all should know that a good Shepherd had come to care for
   the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The multitudes were ready enough
   to welcome the good news; the difficulty was to meet the pressing
   demand of the hour. The harvest, the grain, ready for reaping, was
   plenteous, but the laborers were few. [146]

   In connection with this mission four things call for special notice:
   The sphere assigned for the work, the nature of the work, the
   instructions for carrying it on, the results of the mission, and the
   return of the missionaries. These points we shall consider in their
   order, except that, for convenience, we shall reserve Christ's
   instructions to His disciples for the last place, and give them a
   section to themselves.

   I. The sphere of the mission, as described in general terms, was the
   whole land of Israel. "Go," said Jesus to the twelve, "to the lost
   sheep of the house of Israel;." and further on, in Matthew's narrative,
   He speaks to them as if the plan of the mission involved a visit to all
   the cities of Israel. [147] Practically, however, the operations of the
   disciples seem to have been restricted to their native province of
   Galilee, and even within its narrow limits to have been carried on
   rather among the villages and hamlets, than in considerable towns or
   cities like Tiberias. The former of these statements is supported by
   the fact that the doings of the disciples attracted the attention of
   Herod the tetrarch of Galilee, [148] which implies that they took place
   in his neighborhood; [149] while the latter is proved by the words of
   the third evangelist in giving a summary account of the mission: "They
   departed and went through the villages (towns, Eng. Ver.), preaching
   the gospel, and healing everywhere." [150]

   While the apprentice missionaries were permitted by their instructions
   to go to any of the lost sheep of Israel, to all if practicable, they
   were expressly forbidden to extend their labors beyond these limits.
   They were not to go into the way of the Gentiles, nor enter into any
   city or town of the Samaritans. [151] This prohibition arose in part
   out of the general plan which Christ had formed for founding the
   kingdom of God on the earth. His ultimate aim was the conquest of the
   world; but in order to do that, He deemed it necessary first to secure
   a strong base of operations in the Holy Land and among the chosen
   people. Therefore He ever regarded Himself personally as a Messenger of
   God to the Jewish nation, seriously giving that as a reason why He
   should not work among the heathen, [152] and departing occasionally
   from the rule only in order to supply in His own ministry prophetic
   intimations of an approaching time when Jew and Samaritan and Gentile
   should be united on equal terms in one divine commonwealth. [153] But
   the principal reason of the prohibition lay in the present spiritual
   condition of the disciples themselves. The time would come when Jesus
   might say to His chosen ones, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the
   gospel to every creature;." [154] but that time was not yet. The
   twelve, at the period of their first trial mission, were not fit to
   preach the gospel, or to do good works, either among Samaritans or
   Gentiles. Their hearts were too narrow, their prejudices too strong:
   there was too much of the Jew, too little of the Christian, in their
   character. For the catholic work of the apostleship they needed a new
   divine illumination and a copious baptism with the benignant spirit of
   love. Suppose these raw evangelists had gone into a Samaritan village,
   what would have happened? In all probability they would have been drawn
   into disputes on the religious differences between Samaritans and Jews,
   in which, of course, they would have lost their temper; so that,
   instead of seeking the salvation of the people among whom they had
   come, they would rather be in a mood to call down fire from heaven to
   consume them, as they actually proposed to do at a subsequent period.
   [155]

   2. The work intrusted to the twelve was in one department very
   extensive, and in the other very limited. They were endowed with
   unlimited powers of healing, but their commission was very restricted
   so far as preaching was concerned. In regard to the former their
   instructions were: "Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead,
   cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give;." in regard to
   the latter: "As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
   hand." [156] The commission in the one case seems too wide, in the
   other too narrow; but in both the wisdom of Jesus is apparent to a
   deeper consideration. In so far as miraculous works were concerned,
   there was no need for restriction, unless it were to avoid the risk of
   producing elation and vanity in those who wielded such wonderful power
   -- a risk which was certainly not imaginary, but which could be
   remedied when it assumed tangible form. All the miracles wrought by the
   twelve were really wrought by Jesus Himself, their sole function
   consisting in making a believing use of His name. This seems to have
   been perfectly understood by all; for the works done by the apostles
   did not lead the people of Galilee to wonder who they were, but only
   who and what He was in whose name all these things were done. [157]
   Therefore, it being Christ's will that such miracles should be wrought
   through the instrumentality of His disciples, it was just as easy for
   them to do the greatest works as to do the smaller; if, indeed, there
   be any sense in speaking of degrees of difficulty in connection with
   miracles, which is more than doubtful.

   As regards the preaching, on the other hand, there was not only reason,
   but necessity, for restriction. The disciples could do no more than
   proclaim the fact that the kingdom was at hand, and bid men everywhere
   repent, by way of a preparation for its advent. This was really all
   they knew themselves. They did not as yet understand, in the least
   degree, the doctrine of the cross; they did not even know the nature of
   the kingdom. They had, indeed, heard their Master discourse profoundly
   thereon, but they had not comprehended his words. Their ideas
   respecting the coming kingdom were nearly as crude and carnal as were
   those of other Jews, who looked for the restoration of Israel's
   political independence and temporal prosperity as in the glorious days
   of old. In one point only were they in advance of current notions. They
   had learned from John and from Jesus that repentance was necessary in
   order to citizenship in this kingdom. In all other respects they and
   their hearers were pretty much on a level. Far from wondering,
   therefore, that the preaching programme of the disciples was so
   limited, we are rather tempted to wonder how Christ could trust them to
   open their mouths at all, even on the one topic of the kingdom. Was
   there not a danger that men with such crude ideas might foster delusive
   hopes, and give rise to political excitement? Nay, may we not discover
   actual traces of such excitement in the notice taken of their movements
   at Herod's court, and in the proposal of the multitude not long after,
   to take Jesus by force to make Him a king? [158] Doubtless there was
   danger in this direction; and therefore, while He could not, to avoid
   it, leave the poor perishing people uncared for, Jesus took all
   possible precautions to obviate mischief as far as might be, by in
   effect prohibiting His messengers from entering into detail on the
   subject of the kingdom, and by putting a sound form of words into their
   mouths. They were instructed to announce the kingdom as a kingdom of
   heaven; [159] a thing which some might deem a lovely vision, but which
   all worldly men would guess to be quite another thing from what they
   desired. A kingdom of heaven! What was that to them? What they wanted
   was a kingdom of earth, in which they might live peaceably and happily
   under just government, and, above all, with plenty to eat and drink. A
   kingdom of heaven! That was only for such as had no earthly hope; a
   refuge from despair, a melancholy consolation in absence of any better
   comfort. Even so, ye worldlings! Only for such as ye deem miserable was
   the message meant. To the poor the kingdom was to be preached. To the
   laboring and heavy laden was the invitation "Come to me" addressed, and
   the promise of rest made; of rest from ambition and discontent, and
   scheming, carking care, in the blessed hope of the supernal and the
   eternal.

   3. The impression produced by the labors of the twelve seems to have
   been very considerable. The fame of their doings, as already remarked,
   reached the ears of Herod, and great crowds appear to have accompanied
   them as they moved from place to place. On their return, e.g. from the
   mission to rejoin the company of their Master, they were thronged by an
   eager, admiring multitude who had witnessed or experienced the benefits
   of their work, so that it was necessary for them to withdraw into a
   desert place in order to obtain a quiet interval of rest. "There were
   many," the second evangelist informs us, "coming and going, and they
   had no leisure so much as to eat. And they departed unto a desert place
   by ship privately." [160] Even in the desert solitudes on the eastern
   shore of the Sea of Galilee they failed to secure the desired privacy.
   "The people saw them departing, and ran afoot thither (round the end of
   the sea) out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto
   Him." [161]

   In quality the results of the mission appear to have been much less
   satisfactory than in their extent. The religious impressions produced
   seem to have been in a great measure superficial and evanescent. There
   were many blossoms, so to speak, on the apple-tree in the springtide of
   this Galilean "revival;." but only a comparatively small number of them
   set in fruit, while of these a still smaller number ever reached the
   stage of ripe fruit. This we learn from what took place shortly after,
   in connection with Christ's discourse on the bread of life, in the
   synagogue of Capernaum. Then the same men who, after the miraculous
   feeding in the desert, would have made Christ a king, deserted Him in a
   body, scandalized by His mysterious doctrine; and those who did this
   were, for the most part, just the men who had listened to the twelve
   while they preached repentance. [162]

   Such an issue to a benevolent undertaking must have been deeply
   disappointing to the heart of Jesus. Yet it is remarkable that the
   comparative abortiveness of the first evangelistic movement did not
   prevent Him from repeating the experiment some time after on a still
   more extensive scale. "After these things," writes the third
   evangelist, "the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two
   and two before His face, into every city and place whither He Himself
   would come." [163] The TÃ¼bingen school of critics, indeed, as we have
   already indicated, [164] assure us that this mission had no existence,
   being a pure invention of the third evangelist, intended to thrust into
   the shade the mission of the twelve, and to exhibit the Christian
   religion as a religion for humanity, represented by the Samaritans as
   the recipients, and by the seventy as the preachers of the faith, the
   number corresponding to the number of the nations. The theory is not
   devoid of plausibility, and it must be owned the history of this
   mission is very obscure; but the assumption of invention is violent,
   and we may safely take for granted that Luke's narrative rests on an
   authentic tradition. The motive of this second mission was the same as
   in the case of the first, as were also the instructions to the
   missionaries. Jesus still felt deep compassion for the perishing
   multitude, and hoping against hope, made a new attempt to save the lost
   sheep. He would have all men called at least to the fellowship of the
   kingdom, even though few should be chosen to it. And when the immediate
   results were promising He was gratified, albeit knowing, from past
   experience as well as by divine insight, that the faith and repentance
   of many were only too likely to be evanescent as the early dew. When
   the seventy returned from their mission, and reported their great
   success, He hailed it as an omen of the downfall of Satan's kingdom,
   and, rejoicing in spirit, gave thanks to the Supreme Ruler in heaven
   and earth, His Father, that while the things of the kingdom were hid
   from the wise and the prudent, the people of intelligence and
   discretion, they were by His grace revealed unto babes -- the rude, the
   poor, the ignorant. [165]

   The reference in the thanksgiving prayer of Jesus to the "wise and
   prudent" suggests the thought that these evangelistic efforts were
   regarded with disfavor by the refined, fastidious classes of Jewish
   religious society. This is in itself probable. There are always men in
   the church, intelligent, wise, and even good, to whom popular religious
   movements are distasteful. The noise, the excitement, the
   extravagances, the delusions, the misdirection of zeal, the rudeness of
   the agents, the instability of the converts -- all these things offend
   them. The same class of minds would have taken offence at the
   evangelistic work of the twelve and the seventy, for undoubtedly it was
   accompanied with the same drawbacks. The agents were ignorant; they had
   few ideas in their heads; they understand little of divine truth; their
   sole qualification was, that they were earnest and could preach
   repentance well. Doubtless, also, there was plenty of noise and
   excitement among the multitudes who heard them preach; and we certainly
   know that their zeal was both ill-informed and short-lived. These
   things, in fact, are standing features of all popular movements.
   Jonathan Edwards, speaking with reference to the "revival" of religion
   which took place in America in his day, says truly: "A great deal of
   noise and tumult, confusion and uproar, darkness mixed with light, and
   evil with good, is always to be expected in the beginning of something
   very glorious in the state of things in human society or the church of
   God. After nature has long been shut up in a cold, dead state, when the
   sun returns in the spring, there is, together with the increase of the
   light and heat of the sun, very tempestuous weather before all is
   settled, calm, and serene, and all nature rejoices in its bloom and
   beauty." [166]

   None of the "wise and prudent" knew half so well as Jesus what evil
   would be mixed with the good in the work of the kingdom. But He was not
   so easily offended as they. The Friend of sinners was ever like
   Himself. He sympathized with the multitude, and could not, like the
   Pharisees, contentedly resign them to a permanent condition of
   ignorance and depravity. He rejoiced greatly over even one lost sheep
   restored; and He was, one might say overjoyed, when not one, but a
   whole flock, even began to return to the fold. It pleased Him to see
   men repenting even for a season, and pressing into the kingdom even
   rudely and violently; [167] for His love was strong, and where strong
   love is, even wisdom and refinement will not be fastidious.

   Before passing from this topic, let us observe that there is another
   class of Christians, quite distinct from the wise and prudent, in whose
   eyes such evangelistic labors as those of the twelve stand in no need
   of vindication. Their tendency, on the contrary, is to regard such
   labors as the whole work of the kingdom. Revival of religion among the
   neglected masses is for them the sum of all good-doing. Of the more
   still, less observable work of instruction going on in the church they
   take no account. Where there is no obvious excitement, the church in
   their view is dead, and her ministry inefficient. Such need to be
   reminded that there were two religious movements going on in the days
   of the Lord Jesus. One consisted in rousing the mass out of the stupor
   of indifference; the other consisted in the careful, exact training of
   men already in earnest, in the principles and truths of the divine
   kingdom. Of the one movement the disciples, that is, both the twelve
   and the seventy, were the agents; of the other movement they were the
   subjects. And the latter movement, though less noticeable, and much
   more limited in extent, was by far more important than the former; for
   it was destined to bring forth fruit that should remain -- to tell not
   merely on the present time, but on the whole history of the world. The
   deep truths which the great Teacher was now quietly and unobservedly,
   as in the dark, instilling into the minds of a select band, the
   recipients of His confidential teaching were to speak in the broad
   daylight ere long; and the sound of their voice would not stop till it
   had gone through all the earth. There would have been a poor outlook
   for the kingdom of heaven if Christ had neglected this work, and given
   Himself up entirely to vague evangelism among the masses.

   4. When the twelve had finished their mission, they returned and told
   their Master all that they had done and taught. Of their report, or of
   His remarks thereon, no details are recorded. Such details we do find,
   however, in connection with the later mission of the seventy. "The
   seventy," we read, "returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
   devils are subject unto us through Thy name." [168] The same evangelist
   from whom these words are quoted, informs us that, after congratulating
   the disciples on their success, and expressing His own satisfaction
   with the facts reported, Jesus spoke to them the warning word:
   "Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto
   you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven."
   [169] It was a timely caution against elation and vanity. It is very
   probable that a similar word of caution was addressed to the twelve
   also after their return. Such a word would certainly not have been
   unseasonable in their case. They had been engaged in the same exciting
   work, they had wielded the same miraculous powers, they had been
   equally successful, they were equally immature in character, and
   therefore it was equally difficult for them to bear success. It is most
   likely, therefore, that when Jesus said to them on their return, "Come
   ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile," [170] He was
   not caring for their bodies alone, but was prudently seeking to provide
   repose for their heated minds as well as for their jaded frames.

   The admonition to the seventy is indeed a word in season to all who are
   very zealous in the work of evangelism, especially such as are crude in
   knowledge and grace. It hints at the possibility of their own spiritual
   health being injured by their very zeal in seeking the salvation of
   others. This may happen in many ways. Success may make the evangelists
   vain, and they may begin to sacrifice unto their own net. They may fall
   under the dominion of the devil through their very joy that he is
   subject unto them. They may despise those who have been less
   successful, or denounce them as deficient in zeal. The eminent American
   divine already quoted gives a lamentable account of the pride,
   presumption, arrogance, conceit, and censoriousness which characterized
   many of the more active promoters of religious revival in his day.
   [171] Once more, they may fall into carnal security respecting their
   own spiritual state, deeming it impossible that any thing can go wrong
   with those who are so devoted, and whom God has so greatly owned. An
   obvious as well as dangerous mistake; for doubtless Judas took part in
   this Galilean mission, and, for aught we know to the contrary, was as
   successful as his fellow-disciples in casting out devils. Graceless men
   may for a season be employed as agents in promoting the work of grace
   in the hearts of others. Usefulness does not necessarily imply
   goodness, according to the teaching of Christ Himself. "Many," He
   declares in the Sermon on the Mount, "will say unto me on that day,
   Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by Thy name, and by Thy name cast out
   devils, and by Thy name do many wonderful works?" And mark the answer
   which He says He will give such. It is not: I call in question the
   correctness of your statement -- that is tacitly admitted; it is: "I
   never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity." [172]

   These solemn words suggest the need of watchfulness and
   self-examination; but they are not designed to discourage or
   discountenance zeal. We must not interpret them as if they meant,
   "Never mind doing good, only be good;." or, "Care not for the salvation
   of others: look to your own salvation." Jesus Christ did not teach a
   listless or a selfish religion. He inculcated on His disciples a
   large-hearted generous concern for the spiritual well-being of men. To
   foster such a spirit He sent the twelve on this trial mission, even
   when they were comparatively unfitted for the work, and notwithstanding
   the risk of spiritual harm to which it exposed them. At all hazards He
   would have His apostles be filled with enthusiasm for the advancement
   of the kingdom; only taking due care, when the vices to which young
   enthusiasts are liable began to appear, to check them by a warning word
   and a timely retreat into solitude.

  SECTION II. THE INSTRUCTIONS

   The instructions given by Jesus to the twelve in sending them forth on
   their first mission, are obviously divisible into two parts. The first,
   shorter part, common to the narratives of all the three first
   evangelists, relates to the present; the second and much the longer
   part, peculiar to Matthew's narrative, relates mainly to the distant
   future. In the former, Christ tells His disciples what to do now in
   their apprentice apostleship; in the latter, what they must do and
   endure when they have become apostles on the great scale, preaching the
   gospel, not to Jews only, but to all nations.

   It has been doubted whether the discourse included in the second part
   of the apostolic or missionary instructions, as given by Matthew, was
   really uttered by Jesus on this occasion. Stress has been laid by those
   who take the negative view of this question on the facts that the first
   evangelist alone gives the discourse in connection with the trial
   mission, and that the larger portion of its contents are given by the
   other evangelists in other connections. Reference has also been made,
   in support of this view, to the statement made by Jesus to His
   disciples, in His farewell address to them before the crucifixion, that
   He had not till then spoken to them of coming persecutions, and for
   this reason, that while He was with them it was unnecessary. [173]
   Finally, it has been deemed unlikely that Jesus would frighten His
   inexperienced disciples by alluding to dangers not imminent at the time
   of their mission in Galilee. These doubts, in view of the topical
   method of grouping his materials undoubtedly followed by Matthew, are
   legitimate, but they are not conclusive. It was natural that Jesus
   should signalize the first missionary enterprise of the twelve chosen
   men by some such discourse as Matthew records, setting forth the
   duties, perils, encouragements, and rewards of the apostolic vocation.
   It was His way, on solemn occasions, to speak as a prophet who in the
   present saw the future, and from small beginnings looked forward to
   great ultimate issues. And this Galilean mission, though humble and
   limited compared with the great undertaking of after years, was really
   a solemn event. It was the beginning of that vast work for which the
   twelve had been chosen, which embraced the world in its scope, and
   aimed at setting up on earth the kingdom of God. If the Sermon on the
   Mount was appropriately delivered on the occasion when the apostolic
   company was formed, this discourse on the apostolic vocation was not
   less appropriate when the members of that company first put their hands
   to the work unto which they had been called. Even the allusions to
   distant dangers contained in the discourse appear on reflection natural
   and seasonable, and calculated to re-assure rather than to frighten the
   disciples. It must be remembered that the execution of the Baptist had
   recently occurred, and that the twelve were about to commence their
   missionary labors within the dominions of the tyrant by whose command
   the barbarous murder had been committed. Doubtless these humble men who
   were to take up and repeat the Baptist's message, "Repent," ran no
   present risk of his fate; but it was natural that they should fear, and
   it was also natural that their Master should think of their future when
   such fears would be any thing but imaginary; and on both accounts it
   was seasonable to say to them in effect: Dangers are coming, but fear
   not.

   Such, in substance, is the burden of the second part of Christ's
   instructions to the twelve. Of the first part, on the other hand, the
   burden is, Care not. These two words, Care not, Fear not, are the soul
   and marrow of all that was said by way of prelude to the first
   missionary enterprise, and we may add, to all which might follow. For
   here Jesus speaks to all ages and to all times, telling the Church in
   what spirit all her missionary enterprises must be undertaken and
   carried on, that they may have His blessing.

   I. The duty of entering on their mission without carefulness, relying
   on Providence for the necessaries of life, was inculcated on the twelve
   by their Master in very strong and lively terms. They were instructed
   to procure nothing for the journey, but just to go as they were. They
   must provide neither gold nor silver, nor even so much as brass coin in
   their purses, no scrip or wallet to carry food, no change of raiment;
   not even sandals for their feet, or a staff for their hands. If they
   had the last-mentioned articles, good and well; if not, they could do
   without them. They might go on their errand of love barefooted, and
   without the aid even of a staff to help them on their weary way, having
   their feet shod only with the preparation of the gospel of peace, and
   leaning their weight upon God's words of promise, "As thy days, so
   shall thy strength be." [174]

   In these directions for the way, it is the spirit, and not the mere
   letter, which is of intrinsic and permanent value. The truth of this
   statement is evident from the very variations of the evangelists in
   reporting Christ's words. One, for example (Mark), makes Him say to His
   disciples in effect: "If you have a staff in your hand, and sandals on
   your feet, and one coat on your back, let that suffice." Another
   (Matthew) represents Jesus as saying: "Provide nothing for this
   journey, neither coat, shoes, nor staff." [175] In spirit the two
   versions come to the same thing; but if we insist on the letter of the
   injunctions with legal strictness, there is an obvious contradiction
   between them. What Jesus meant to say, in whatever form of language He
   expressed Himself, was this: Go at once, and go as you are, and trouble
   not yourselves about food or raiment, or any bodily want; trust in God
   for these. His instructions proceeded on the principle of division of
   labor, assigning to the servants of the kingdom military duty, and to
   God the commissariat department.

   So understood, the words of our Lord are of permanent validity, and to
   be kept in mind by all who would serve Him in His kingdom. And though
   the circumstances of the church have greatly altered since these words
   were first spoken, they have not been lost sight of. Many a minister
   and missionary has obeyed those instructions almost in their letter,
   and many more have kept them in their spirit. Nay, has not every poor
   student fulfilled these injunctions, who has gone forth from the humble
   roof of his parents to be trained for the ministry of the gospel,
   without money in his pocket either to buy food or to pay fees, only
   with simple faith and youthful hope in his heart, knowing as little how
   he is to find his way to the pastoral office, as Abraham knew how to
   find his way to the promised land when he left his native abode, but,
   with Abraham, trusting that He who said to him, "Leave thy father's
   house," will be his guide, his shield, and his provider? And if those
   who thus started on their career do at length arrive at a wealthy
   place, in which their wants are abundantly supplied, what is that but
   an indorsement by Providence of the law enunciated by the Master: "The
   workman is worthy of his meat"? [176]

   The directions given to the twelve with respect to temporalities, in
   connection with their first mission, were meant to be an education for
   their future work. On entering on the duties of the apostolate, they
   should have to live literally by faith, and Jesus mercifully sought to
   inure them to the habit while He was with them on earth. Therefore, in
   sending them out to preach in Galilee, He said to them in effect: "Go
   and learn to seek the kingdom of God with a single heart, unconcerned
   about food or raiment; for till ye can do that ye are not fit to be my
   apostles." They had indeed been learning to do that ever since they
   began to follow Him; for those who belonged to His company literally
   lived from day to day, taking no thought for the morrow. But there was
   a difference between their past state and that on which they were about
   to enter. Hitherto Jesus had been with them; now they were to be left
   for a season to themselves. Hitherto they had been like young children
   in a family under the care of their parents, or like young birds in a
   nest sheltered by their mother's wing, and needing only to open their
   mouths wide in order to get them filled; now they were to become like
   boys leaving their father's house to serve an apprenticeship, or like
   fledglings leaving the warm nest in which they were nursed, to exercise
   their wings and seek food for themselves.

   While requiring His disciples to walk by faith, Jesus gave their faith
   something to rest on, by encouraging them to hope that what they
   provided not for themselves God would provide for them through the
   instrumentality of His people. "Into whatsoever city or town ye shall
   enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there abide till ye go thence."
   [177] He took for granted, we observe, that there would always be found
   at every place at least one good man with a warm heart, who would
   welcome the messengers of the kingdom to his house and table for the
   pure love of God and of the truth. Surely no unreasonable assumption!
   It were a wretched hamlet, not to say town, that had not a single
   worthy person in it. Even wicked Sodom had a Lot within its walls who
   could entertain angels unawares.

   To insure good treatment of His servants in all ages wherever the
   gospel might be preached, Jesus made it known that He put a high
   premium on all acts of kindness done towards them. This advertisement
   we find at the close of the address delivered to the twelve at this
   time: "He that receiveth you," He said to them, "receiveth me; and he
   that receiveth me, receiveth Him that sent me. He that receiveth a
   prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and
   he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall
   receive a righteous man's reward." And then, with increased pathos and
   solemnity, He added: "Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these
   little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily
   I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward." [178] How easy to
   go forth into Galilee, yea, into all the world, serving such a
   sympathetic Master on such terms!

   But while thus encouraging the young evangelists, Jesus did not allow
   them to go away with the idea that all things would be pleasant in
   their experience. He gave them to understand that they should be ill
   received as well as kindly received. They should meet with churls who
   would refuse them hospitality, and with stupid, careless people who
   would reject their message; but even in such cases, He assured them,
   they should not be without consolation. If their peaceful salutation
   were not reciprocated, they should at all events get the benefit of
   their own spirit of good-will: their peace would return to themselves.
   If their words were not welcomed by any to whom they preached, they
   should at least be free from blame; they might shake off the dust from
   their feet, and say: "Your blood be upon your own heads, we are clean;
   we leave you to your doom, and go elsewhere." [179] Solemn words, not
   to be uttered, as they are too apt to be, especially by young and
   inexperienced disciples, in pride, impatience, or anger, but humbly,
   calmly, deliberately, as a part of God's message to men. When uttered
   in any other spirit, it is a sign that the preacher has been as much to
   blame as the hearer for the rejection of his message. Few have any
   right to utter such words at all; for it requires rare preaching indeed
   to make the fault of unbelieving hearers so great that it shall be more
   tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for them.
   But such preaching has been. Christ's own preaching was such, and hence
   the fearful doom He pronounced on those who rejected His words. Such
   also the preaching of the apostles was to be; and therefore to uphold
   their authority, Jesus solemnly declared that the penalty for despising
   their word would be not less than for neglecting His own. [180]

   2. The remaining instructions, referring to the future rather than to
   the present, while much more copious, do not call for lengthened
   explanation. The burden of them all, as we have said, is "Fear not."
   This exhortation, like the refrain of a song, is repeated again and
   again in the course of the address. [181] From that fact the twelve
   might have inferred that their future lot was to be of a kind fitted to
   inspire fear. But Jesus did not leave them to learn this by inference;
   He told them of it plainly. "Behold," He said, with the whole history
   of the church in His view, "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the
   midst of wolves." Then He went on to explain in detail, and with
   appalling vividness, the various forms of danger which awaited the
   messengers of truth; how they should be delivered up to councils,
   scourged in synagogues, brought before governors and kings (like Felix,
   Festus, Herod), and hated of all for His name's sake. [182] He
   explained to them, at the same time, that this strange treatment was
   inevitable in the nature of things, being the necessary consequence of
   divine truth acting in the world like a chemical solvent, and
   separating men into parties, according to the spirit which ruled in
   them. The truth would divide even members of the same family, and make
   them bitterly hostile to each other; [183] and however deplorable the
   result might be, it was one for which there was no remedy. Offences
   must come: "Think not," He said to His disciples, horrified at the dark
   picture, and perhaps secretly hoping that their Master had painted it
   in too sombre colors, "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth:
   I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at
   variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and
   the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a man's foes shall
   be they of his own household." [184]

   Amid such dangers two virtues are specially needful -- caution and
   fidelity; the one, that God's servants may not be cut off prematurely
   or unnecessarily, the other, that while they live, they may really do
   God's work, and fight for the truth. In such times Christ's disciples
   must not fear, but be brave and true; and yet, while fearless, they
   must not be foolhardy. These qualities it is not easy to combine; for
   conscientious men are apt to be rash, and prudent men are apt to be
   unfaithful. Yet the combination is not impossible, else it would not be
   required, as it is in this discourse. For it was just the importance of
   cultivating the apparently incompatible virtues of caution and fidelity
   that Jesus meant to teach by the remarkable proverb-precept: "Be wise
   as serpents, harmless as doves." [185] The serpent is the emblem of
   cunning, the dove of simplicity. No creatures can be more unlike; yet
   Jesus requires of His disciples to be at once serpents in cautiousness,
   and doves in simplicity of aim and purity of heart. Happy they who can
   be both; but if we cannot, let us at least be doves. The dove must come
   before the serpent in our esteem, and in the development of our
   character. This order is observable in the history of all true
   disciples. They begin with spotless sincerity; and after being betrayed
   by a generous enthusiasm into some acts of rashness, they learn betimes
   the serpent's virtues. If we invert the order, as too many do, and
   begin by being prudent and judicious to admiration, the effect will be
   that the higher virtue will not only be postponed, but sacrificed. The
   dove will be devoured by the serpent: the cause of truth and
   righteousness will be betrayed out of a base regard to
   self-preservation and worldly advantage.

   On hearing a general maxim of morals announced, one naturally wishes to
   know how it applies to particular cases. Christ met this wish in
   connection with the deep, pregnant maxim, "Be wise as serpents,
   harmless as doves," by giving examples of its application. The first
   case supposed is that of the messengers of truth being brought up
   before civil or ecclesiastical tribunals to answer for themselves. Here
   the dictate of wisdom is, "Beware of men," [186] "Do not be so simple
   as to imagine all men good, honest, fair, tolerant. Remember there are
   wolves in the world -- men full of malice, falsehood, and
   unscrupulousness, capable of inventing the most atrocious charges
   against you, and of supporting them by the most unblushing mendacity.
   Keep out of their clutches if you can; and when you fall into their
   hands, expect neither candor, justice, nor generosity." But how are
   such men to be answered? Must craft be met with craft, lies with lies?
   No; here is the place for the simplicity of the dove. Cunning and craft
   boot not at such an hour; safety lies in trusting to Heaven's guidance,
   and telling the truth. "When they deliver you up, take no (anxious)
   thought how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you in that
   same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the
   Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you." [187] The counsel given
   to the apostles has been justified by experience. What a noble book the
   speeches uttered by confessors of the truth under the inspiration of
   the Divine Spirit, collected together, would make! It would be a sort
   of Martyrs' Bible.

   Jesus next puts the case of the heralds of His gospel being exposed to
   popular persecutions, and shows the bearing of the maxim upon it
   likewise. Such persecutions, as distinct from judicial proceedings,
   were common in apostolic experience, and they are a matter of course in
   all critical eras. The ignorant, superstitious populace, filled with
   prejudice and passion, and instigated by designing men, play the part
   of obstructives to the cause of truth, mobbing, mocking, and assaulting
   the messengers of God. How, then, are the subjects of this
   ill-treatment to act? On the one hand, they are to show the wisdom of
   the serpent by avoiding the storm of popular ill-will when it arises;
   and on the other hand, they are to exhibit the simplicity of the dove
   by giving the utmost publicity to their message, though conscious of
   the risk they run. "When they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
   the next;." [188] yet, undaunted by clamor, calumny, violence, "what I
   tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light; what ye hear in the ear,
   that preach ye upon the house-tops." [189]

   To each of these injunctions a reason is annexed. Flight is justified
   by the remark, "Verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the
   cities of Israel till the Son of man be come." [190] The coming alluded
   to is the destruction of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the Jewish
   nation; and the meaning is, that the apostles would barely have time,
   before the catastrophe came, to go over all the land, warning the
   people to save themselves from the doom of an untoward generation, so
   that they could not well afford to tarry in any locality after its
   inhabitants had heard and rejected the message. The souls of all were
   alike precious; and if one city did not receive the word, perhaps
   another would. [191] The reason annexed to the injunction to give the
   utmost publicity to the truth, in spite of all possible dangers, is:
   "The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord."
   [192] That is to say: To be evil entreated by the ignorant and violent
   multitude is hard to bear, but not harder for you than for me, who
   already, as ye know, have had experience of popular malice at Nazareth,
   and am destined, as ye know not, to have yet more bitter experience of
   it at Jerusalem. Therefore see that ye hide not your light under a
   bushel to escape the rage of wolfish men.

   The disciples are supposed, lastly, to be in peril not merely of trial,
   mocking, and violence, but even of their life, and are instructed how
   to act in that extremity. Here also the maxim, "Wise as serpents,
   harmless as doves," comes into play in both its parts. In this case the
   wisdom of the serpent lies in knowing what to fear. Jesus reminds His
   disciples that there are two kinds of deaths, one caused by the sword,
   the other by unfaithfulness to duty; and tells them in effect, that
   while both are evils to be avoided, if possible, yet if a choice must
   be made, the latter death is most to be dreaded. "Fear not," He said,
   "them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but
   rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell," --
   the tempter, that is, who, when one is in danger, whispers: Save
   thyself at any sacrifice of principle or conscience. [193] The
   simplicity of the dove in presence of extreme peril consists in
   childlike trust in the watchful providence of the Father in heaven.
   Such trust Jesus exhorted His disciples to cherish in charmingly simple
   and pathetic language. He told them that God cared even for sparrows,
   and reminded them that, however insignificant they might seem to
   themselves, they were at least of more value than many sparrows, not to
   say than two, whose money value was just one farthing. If God neglected
   not even a pair of sparrows, but provided for them a place in His world
   where they might build their nest and safely bring forth their young,
   would He not care for them as they went forth two and two preaching the
   doctrine of the kingdom? Yea! He would; the very hairs of their head
   were numbered. Therefore they might go forth without fear, trusting
   their lives to His care; remembering also that, at worst, death was no
   great evil, seeing that for the faithful was reserved a crown of life,
   and, for those who confessed the Son of man, the honor of being
   confessed by Him in turn before His Father in heaven. [194]

   Such were the instructions of Christ to the twelve when He sent them
   forth to preach and to heal. It was a rare, unexampled discourse,
   strange to the ears of us moderns, who can hardly imagine such stern
   requirements being seriously made, not to say exactly complied with.
   Some readers of these pages may have stood and looked up at Mont Blanc
   from Courmayeur or Chamounix. Such is our attitude towards this first
   missionary sermon. It is a mountain at which we gaze in wonder from a
   position far below, hardly dreaming of climbing to its summit. Some
   noble ones, however, have made the arduous ascent; and among these the
   first place of honor must be assigned to the chosen companions of
   Jesus.

9. THE GALILEAN CRISIS
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. THE MIRACLE

    John 6:1-15; Matt. 14:13-21; Mark 6:33-34; Luke 9:11-17.

   The sixth chapter of John's Gospel is full of marvels. It tells of a
   great miracle, a great enthusiasm, a great storm, a great sermon, a
   great apostasy, and a great trial of faith and fidelity endured by the
   twelve. It contains, indeed, the compendious history of an important
   crisis in the ministry of Jesus and the religious experience of His
   disciples, -- a crisis in many respects foreshadowing the great final
   one, which happened little more than a year afterwards, [195] when a
   more famous miracle still was followed by a greater popularity, to be
   succeeded in turn by a more complete desertion, and to end in the
   crucifixion, by which the riddle of the Capernaum discourse was solved,
   and its prophecy fulfilled. [196]

   The facts recorded by John in this chapter of his Gospel may all be
   comprehended under these four heads: the miracle in the wilderness, the
   storm on the lake, the sermon in the synagogue, and the subsequent
   sifting of Christ's disciples. These, in their order, we propose to
   consider in four distinct sections.

   The scene of the miracle was on the eastern shore of the Galilean Sea.
   Luke fixes the precise locality in the neighborhood of a city called
   Bethsaida. [197] This, of course, could not be the Bethsaida on the
   western shore, the city of Andrew and Peter. But there was, it appears,
   another city of the same name at the north-eastern extremity of the
   lake, called by way of distinction, Bethsaida Julias. [198] The site of
   this city, we are informed by an eye-witness, "is discernible on the
   lower slope of the hill which overhangs the rich plain at the mouth of
   the Jordan" (that is, at the place where the waters of the Upper Jordan
   join the Sea of Galilee). "The desert place,'" the same author goes on
   to say, by way of proving the suitableness of the locality to be the
   scene of this miracle, "was either the green tableland which lies
   halfway up the hill immediately above Bethsaida, or else in the parts
   of the plain not cultivated by the hand of man would be found the much
   green grass,' still fresh in the spring of the year when this event
   occurred, before it had faded away in the summer sun: the tall grass
   which, broken down by the feet of the thousands then gathered together,
   would make as it were, couches' for them to recline upon." [199]

   To this place Jesus and the twelve had retired after the return of the
   latter from their mission, seeking rest and privacy. But what they
   sought they did not find. Their movements were observed, and the people
   flocked along the shore toward the place whither they had sailed,
   running all the way, as if fearful that they might escape, and so
   arriving at the landing place before them. [200] The multitude which
   thus gathered around Jesus was very great. All the evangelists agree in
   stating it at five thousand; and as the arrangement of the people at
   the miraculous repast in groups of hundreds and fifties [201] made it
   easy to ascertain their number, we may accept this statement not as a
   rough estimate, but as a tolerably exact calculation.

   Such an immense assemblage testifies to the presence of a great
   excitement among the populations living by the shore of the Sea of
   Galilee. A fervid enthusiasm, a hero-worship, whereof Jesus was the
   object, was at work in their minds. Jesus was the idol of the hour:
   they could not endure his absence; they could not see enough of His
   work, nor hear enough of His teaching. This enthusiasm of the Galileans
   we may regard as the cumulative result of Christ's own past labors, and
   in part also of the evangelistic mission which we considered in the
   last chapter. [202] The infection seems to have spread as far south as
   Tiberias, for John relates that boats came from that city "to the place
   where they did eat bread." [203] Those who were in these boats came too
   late to witness the miracle and share in the feast, but this does not
   prove that their errand was not the same as that of the rest; for,
   owing to their greater distance from the scene, the news would be
   longer in reaching them, and it would take them longer to go thither.

   The great miracle wrought in the neighborhood of Bethsaida Julias
   consisted in the feeding of this vast assemblage of human beings with
   the utterly inadequate means of "five barley loaves and two small
   fishes." [204] It was truly a stupendous transaction, of which we can
   form no conception; but no event in the Gospel history is more
   satisfactorily attested. All the evangelists relate the miracle with
   much minuteness, with little even apparent discrepancy, and with such
   graphic detail as none but eye-witnesses could have supplied. Even
   John, who records so few of Christ's miracles, describes this one with
   as careful a hand as any of his brother evangelists, albeit introducing
   it into his narrative merely as a preface to the sermon on the Bread of
   Life found in his Gospel only.

   This wonderful work, so unexceptionably attested, seems open to
   exception on another ground. It appears to be a miracle without a
   sufficient reason. It cannot be said to have been urgently called for
   by the necessities of the multitude. Doubtless they were hungry, and
   had brought no victuals with them to supply their bodily wants. But the
   miracle was wrought on the afternoon of the day on which they left
   their homes, and most of them might have returned within a few hours.
   It would, indeed, have been somewhat hard to have undertaken such a
   journey at the end of the day without food; but the hardship, even if
   necessary, was far within the limits of human endurance. But it was not
   necessary; for food could have been got on the way without going far,
   in the neighboring towns and villages, so that to disperse them as they
   were would have involved no considerable inconvenience. This is evident
   from the terms in which the disciples made the suggestion that the
   multitude should be sent away. We read: "When the day began to wear
   away, then came the twelve, and said unto Him, Send the multitude away,
   that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge
   and get victuals." [205] In these respects there is an obvious
   difference between the first miraculous feeding and the second, which
   occurred at a somewhat later period at the south-eastern extremity of
   the Lake. On that occasion the people who had assembled around Jesus
   had been three days in the wilderness without aught to eat, and there
   were no facilities for procuring food, so that the miracle was demanded
   by considerations of humanity. [206] Accordingly we find that
   compassion is assigned as the motive for that miracle: "Jesus called
   His disciples unto Him, and saith unto them, I have compassion on the
   multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have
   nothing to eat; and if I send them away fasting to their own houses,
   they will faint by the way; for some of them are come from far." [207]

   If our object were merely to get rid of the difficulty of assigning a
   sufficient motive for the first great miracle of feeding, we might
   content ourselves with saying that Jesus did not need any very urgent
   occasion to induce Him to use His power for the benefit of others. For
   His own benefit He would not use it in case even of extreme need, not
   even after a fast of forty days. But when the well-being (not to say
   the being) of others was concerned, He dispensed miraculous blessings
   with a liberal hand. He did not ask Himself: Is this a grave enough
   occasion for the use of divine power? Is this man ill enough to justify
   a miraculous interference with the laws of nature by healing him? Are
   these people here assembled hungry enough to be fed, like their fathers
   in the wilderness, with bread from heaven? But we do not insist on
   this, because we believe that something else and higher was aimed at in
   this miracle than to satisfy physical appetite. It was a symbolic,
   didactic, critical miracle. It was meant to teach, and also to test; to
   supply a text for the subsequent sermon, and a touchstone to try the
   character of those who had followed Jesus with such enthusiasm. The
   miraculous feast in the wilderness was meant to say to the multitude
   just what our sacramental feast says to us: "I, Jesus the Son of God
   Incarnate, am the bread of life. What this bread is to your bodies, I
   myself am to your souls." And the communicants in that feast were to be
   tested by the way in which they regarded the transaction. The spiritual
   would see in it a sign of Christ's divine dignity, and a seal of His
   saving grace; the carnal would rest simply in the outward fact that
   they had eaten of the loaves and were filled, and would take occasion
   from what had happened to indulge in high hopes of temporal felicity
   under the benign reign of the Prophet and King who had made His
   appearance among them.

   The miracle in the desert was in this view not merely an act of mercy,
   but an act of judgment. Jesus mercifully fed the hungry multitude in
   order that He might sift it, and separate the true from the spurious
   disciples. There was a much more urgent demand for such a sifting than
   for food to satisfy merely physical cravings. If those thousands were
   all genuine disciples, it was well; but if not -- if the greater number
   were following Christ under misapprehension -- the sooner that became
   apparent the better. To allow so large a mixed multitude to follow
   Himself any longer without sifting would have been on Christ's part to
   encourage false hopes, and to give rise to serious misapprehensions as
   to the nature of His kingdom and His earthly mission. And no better
   method of separating the chaff from the wheat in that large company of
   professed disciples could have been devised, than first to work a
   miracle which would bring to the surface the latent carnality of the
   greater number, and then to preach a sermon which could not fail to be
   offensive to the carnal mind.

   That Jesus freely chose, for a reason of His own, the miraculous method
   of meeting the difficulty that had arisen, appears to be not obscurely
   hinted at in the Gospel narratives. Consider, for example, in this
   connection, John's note of time, "The passover, a feast of the Jews,
   was nigh." Is this a merely chronological statement? We think not. What
   further purpose, then, is it intended to serve? To explain how so great
   a crowd came to be gathered around Jesus? -- Such an explanation was
   not required, for the true cause of the great gathering was the
   enthusiasm which had been awakened among the people by the preaching
   and healing work of Jesus and the twelve. The evangelist refers to the
   approaching passover, it would seem, not to explain the movement of the
   people, but rather to explain the acts and words of His Lord about to
   be related. "The passover was nigh, and" -- so may we bring out John's
   meaning -- "Jesus was thinking of it, though He went not up to the
   feast that season. He thought of the paschal lamb, and how He, the true
   Paschal Lamb, would ere long be slain for the life of the world; and He
   gave expression to the deep thoughts of His heart in the symbolic
   miracle I am about to relate, and in the mystic discourse which
   followed." [208]

   The view we advocate respecting the motive of the miracle in the
   wilderness seems borne out also by the tone adopted by Jesus in the
   conversation which took place between Himself and the twelve as to how
   the wants of the multitude might be supplied. In the course of that
   conversation, of which fragments have been preserved by the different
   evangelists, two suggestions were made by the disciples. One was to
   dismiss the multitude that they might procure supplies for themselves;
   the other, that they (the disciples) should go to the nearest town (say
   Bethsaida Julias, probably not far off) and purchase as much bread as
   they could get for two hundred denarii, which would suffice to
   alleviate hunger at least, if not to satisfy appetite. [209] Both these
   proposals were feasible, otherwise they would not have been made; for
   the twelve had not spoken thoughtlessly, but after consideration, as
   appears from the fact that one of their number, Andrew, had already
   ascertained how much provision could be got on the spot. The question
   how the multitude could be provided for had evidently been exercising
   the minds of the disciples, and the two proposals were the result of
   their deliberations. Now, what we wish to point out is, that Jesus does
   not appear to have given any serious heed to these proposals. He
   listened to them, not displeased to see the generous concern of His
   disciples for the hungry people, yet with the air of one who meant from
   the first to pursue a different line of action from any they might
   suggest. He behaved like a general in a council of war whose own mind
   is made up, but who is not unwilling to hear what his subordinates will
   say. This is no mere inference of ours, for John actually explains that
   such was the manner in which our Lord acted on the occasion. After
   relating that Jesus addressed to Philip the question, Whence shall we
   buy bread, that these may eat? he adds the parenthetical remark, "This
   He said to prove him, for He Himself knew what He would do." [210]

   Such, then, was the design of the miracle; what now was its result? It
   raised the swelling tide of enthusiasm to its full height, and induced
   the multitude to form a foolish and dangerous purpose -- even to crown
   the wonder -- working Jesus, and make Him their king instead of the
   licentious despot Herod. They said, "This is of a truth that Prophet
   that should come into the world;." and they were on the point of coming
   and taking Jesus by force to make Him a king, insomuch that it was
   necessary that He should make His escape from them, and depart into a
   mountain Himself alone. [211] Such are the express statements of the
   fourth Gospel, and what is there stated is obscurely implied in the
   narratives of Matthew and Mark. They tell how, after the miracle in the
   desert, Jesus straightway constrained His disciples to get into a ship
   and to go to the other side. [212] Why such haste, and why such
   urgency? Doubtless it was late, and there was no time to lose if they
   wished to get home to Capernaum that night. But why go home at all,
   when the people, or at least a part of them, were to pass the night in
   the wilderness? Should the disciples not rather have remained with
   them, to keep them in heart and take a charge of them? Nay, was it
   dutiful in disciples to leave their Master alone in such a situation?
   Doubtless the reluctance of the twelve to depart sprang from their
   asking themselves these very questions; and, as a feeling having such
   an origin was most becoming, the constraint put on them presupposes the
   existence of unusual circumstances, such as those recorded by John. In
   other words, the most natural explanation of the fact recorded by the
   synoptical evangelists is, that Jesus wished to extricate both Himself
   and His disciples from the foolish enthusiasm of the multitude, an
   enthusiasm with which, beyond question, the disciples were only too
   much in sympathy, and for that purpose arranged that they should sail
   away in the dusk across the lake, while He retired into the solitude of
   the mountains. [213]

   What a melancholy result of a hopeful movement have we here! The
   kingdom has been proclaimed, and the good news has been extensively
   welcomed. Jesus, the Messianic King, is become the object of most
   ardent devotion to an enthusiastic population. But, alas! their ideas
   of the kingdom are radically mistaken. Acted out, they would mean
   rebellion and ultimate ruin. Therefore it is necessary that Jesus
   should save Himself from His own friends, and hide Himself from His own
   followers. How certainly do Satan's tares get sown among God's wheat!
   How easily does enthusiasm run into folly and mischief!

   The result of the miracle did not take Jesus by surprise. It was what
   He expected; nay, in a sense, it was what He aimed at. It was time that
   the thoughts of many hearts should be revealed; and the certainty that
   the miracle would help to reveal them was one reason at least for its
   being worked. Jesus furnished for the people a table in the wilderness,
   and gave them of the corn of heaven, and sent them meat to the full,
   [214] that He might prove them, and know what was in their heart, [215]
   -- whether they loved Him for His own sake, or only for the sake of
   expected worldly advantage. That many followed Him from by-ends He knew
   beforehand, but He desired to bring the fact home to their own
   consciences. The miracle put that in His power, and enabled Him to say,
   without fear of contradiction, "Ye seek me, not because ye saw the
   miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled." [216]
   It was a searching word, which might well put all His professed
   followers, not only then, but now, on self-examining thoughts, and lead
   each man to ask himself, Why do I profess Christianity? is it from
   sincere faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and Saviour of the
   world, or from thoughtless compliance with custom, from a regard to
   reputation, or from considerations of worldly advantage?

   [196] Keim, while admitting the reality of a Galilean crisis, thinks
   the account of it in John vi. unhistorical, though he praises it as one
   of the finest compositions in the whole book. The historical account he
   finds in Matt. xvi.; and he discovers in the fourth Gospel manifest
   points of correspondence to the synoptical version. Peter's utterance
   in the close of the chapter is simply his famous confession in another
   form. The devil in John's account corresponds to the Satan of the
   synoptical, only John's devil is in Judas, while the synoptical one is
   in Peter. Keim says that in John's account of the crisis the rise and
   fall of the star of Jesus is compressed into a single chapter, and
   treated as the work of a day. Through feeding and storm Jesus mounts at
   once to the highest popularity, and loses it again as suddenly in
   consequence of the repulsive discourse in Capernaum. But this is a most
   incorrect representation. John does indeed dispose of the crisis in one
   chapter, but he does not make the enthusiasm of the people appear as
   the result of the miracle of feeding or of any one act. He takes up the
   Galilean ministry (of which he knows, though he does not relate it) at
   the point where it has already reached the crisis. And the history
   which he gives, consistent and intelligible in itself, as we hope to
   show, helps to explain things in the synoptical account not in
   themselves clear, e.g. Christ's compelling the disciples to go away
   across the lake in great haste, of which we shall speak farther on.

  SECTION II. THE STORM

    Matt. xiv. 24-33; Mark vi. 45-52; John vi. 16-21.

   "In perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea," wrote Paul,
   describing the varied hardships encountered by himself in the
   prosecution of his great work as the apostle of the Gentiles. Such
   perils meet together in this crisis in the life of Jesus. He has just
   saved himself from the dangerous enthusiasm manifested by the
   thoughtless multitude after the miraculous repast in the desert; and
   now, a few hours later, a still greater disaster threatens to befall
   Him. His twelve chosen disciples, whom He had hurriedly sent off in a
   boat, that they might not encourage the people in their foolish
   project, have been overtaken in a storm while He is alone on the
   mountain praying, and are in imminent danger of being drowned. His
   contrivance for escaping one evil has involved Him in a worse; and it
   seems as if, by a combination of mischances, He were to be suddenly
   deprived of all His followers, both true and false, at once, and left
   utterly alone, as in the last great crisis. The Messianic King watching
   on those heights, like a general on the day of battle, is indeed hard
   pressed, and the battle is going against Him. But the Captain of
   salvation is equal to the emergency; and however sorely perplexed He
   may be for a season, He will be victorious in the end.

   The Sea of Galilee, though but a small sheet of water, some thirteen
   miles long by six broad, is liable to be visited by sharp, sudden
   squalls, probably due to its situation. It lies in a deep hollow of
   volcanic origin, bounded on either side by steep ranges of hills rising
   above the water-level from one to two thousand feet. The difference of
   temperature at the top and bottom of these hills is very considerable.
   Up on the tablelands above the air is cool and bracing; down at the
   margin of the lake, which lies seven hundred feet below the level of
   the ocean, the climate is tropical. The storms caused by this
   inequality of temperature are tropical in violence. They come sweeping
   down the ravines upon the water; and in a moment the lake, calm as
   glass before, becomes from end to end white with foam, whilst the waves
   rise into the air in columns of spray. [217]

   Two such storms of wind were encountered by the twelve after they had
   become disciples, probably within the same year; the one with which we
   are concerned at present, and an earlier one on the occasion of a visit
   to Gadara. [218] Both happened by night, and both were exceedingly
   violent. In the first storm, we are told, the ship was covered with the
   waves, and filled almost to sinking, so that the disciples feared they
   should perish. The second storm was equally violent, and was of much
   longer duration. It caught the twelve apparently when they were
   half-way across, and after the gray of dusk had deepened into the
   darkness of night. From that time the wind blew with unabated force
   till daybreak, in the fourth watch, between the hours of three and six
   in the morning. Some idea of the fury of the blast may be gathered from
   the fact recorded, that even then they were still little more than
   half-way over the sea. They had rowed in all only a distance of
   twenty-five or thirty furlongs, [219] the whole distance in a slanting
   direction, from the eastern to the western shore, being probably about
   fifty. During all those weary hours they had done little more, pulling
   with all their might, than hold their own against wind and waves.

   All this while what was Jesus doing? In the first storm He had been
   with His disciples in the ship, sweetly sleeping after the fatigues of
   the day, "rocked in cradle of the imperious surge." This time He was
   absent, and not sleeping; but away up among the mountains alone,
   watching unto prayer. For He, too, had His own struggle on that
   tempestuous night; not with the howling winds, but with sorrowful
   thoughts. That night He, as it were, rehearsed the agony in Gethsemane,
   and with earnest prayer and absorbing meditation studied the passion
   sermon which He preached on the morrow. So engrossed was His mind with
   His own sad thoughts, that the poor disciples were for a season as if
   forgotten; till at length, at early dawn, looking seawards, [220] He
   saw them toiling in rowing against the contrary wind, and without a
   moment's further delay made haste to their rescue.

   This storm on the Sea of Galilee, besides being important as a
   historical fact, possesses also the significance of an emblem. When we
   consider the time at which it occurred, it is impossible not to connect
   it in our thoughts with the untoward events of the next day. For the
   literal storm on the water was succeeded by a spiritual storm on the
   land, equally sudden and violent, and not less perilous to the souls of
   the twelve than the other had been to their bodies. The bark containing
   the precious freight of Christ's true discipleship was then overtaken
   by a sudden gust of unpopularity, coming down on it like a squall on a
   highland loch, and all but upsetting it. The fickle crowd which but the
   day before would have made Jesus their king, turned away abruptly from
   Him in disappointment and disgust; and it was not without an effort, as
   we shall see, [221] that the twelve maintained their steadfastness.
   They had to pull hard against wind and waves, that they might not be
   carried headlong to ruin by the tornado of apostasy.

   There can be little doubt that the two storms, -- on the lake and on
   the shore, -- coming so close one on the other, would become associated
   in the memory of the apostles; and that the literal storm would be
   stereotyped in their minds as an expressive emblem of the spiritual
   one, and of all similar trials of faith. The incidents of that fearful
   night -- the watching, the wet, the toil without result, the fatigue,
   the terror and despair -- would abide indelibly in their recollection,
   the symbolic representation of all the perils and tribulations through
   which believers must pass on their way to the kingdom of heaven, and
   especially of those that come upon them while they are yet immature in
   the faith. Symbolic significance might be discovered specially in three
   features. The storm took place by night; in the absence of Jesus; and
   while it lasted all progress was arrested. Storms at sea may happen at
   all hours of the day, but trials of faith always happen in the night.
   Were there no darkness there could be no trial. Had the twelve
   understood Christ's discourse in Capernaum, the apostasy of the
   multitude would have seemed to them a light matter. But they did not
   understand it, and hence the solicitude of their Master lest they too
   should forsake Him. In all such trials, also, the absence of the Lord
   to feeling is a constant and most painful feature. Christ is not in the
   ship while the storm rages by night, and we toil on in rowing unaided,
   as we think, by His grace, uncheered by His spiritual presence. It was
   so even with the twelve next day on shore. Their Master, present to
   their eyes, had vanished out of sight to their understanding. They had
   not the comfort of comprehending His meaning, while they clung to Him
   as one who had the words of eternal life. Worst of all, in these trials
   of faith, with all our rowing, we make no progress; the utmost we can
   effect is to hold our own, to keep off the rocky shore in the midst of
   the sea. Happily that is something, yea, it is every thing. For it is
   not always true that if not going forward we must be going backward.
   This is an adage for fair weather only. In a time of storm there is
   such a thing as standing still, and then to do even so much is a great
   achievement. Is it a small thing to weather the storm, to keep off the
   rocks, the sands, and the breakers? Vex not the soul of him who is
   already vexed enough by the buffeting winds, by retailing wise saws
   about progress and backsliding indiscriminately applied. Instead of
   playing thus the part of a Job's friend, rather remind him that the
   great thing for one in his situation is to endure, to be immovable, to
   hold fast his moral integrity and his profession of faith, and to keep
   off the dangerous coasts of immorality and infidelity; and assure him
   that if he will only pull a little longer, however weary his arm, God
   will come and calm the wind, and he will forthwith reach the land.

   The storm on the lake, besides being an apt emblem of the trial of
   faith, was for the twelve an important lesson in faith, helping to
   prepare them for the future which awaited them. The temporary absence
   of their Master was a preparation for His perpetual absence. The
   miraculous interposition of Jesus at the crisis of their peril was
   fitted to impress on their minds the conviction that even after He had
   ascended He would still be with them in the hour of danger. From the
   ultimate happy issue of a plan which threatened for a time to miscarry,
   they might further learn to cherish a calm confidence in the government
   of their exalted Lord, even in midst of most untoward events. They
   probably concluded, when the storm came on, that Jesus had made a
   mistake in ordering them to sail away across the lake while He remained
   behind to dismiss the multitude. The event, however, rebuked this hasty
   judgment, all ending happily. Their experience in this instance was
   fitted to teach a lesson for life: not rashly to infer mismanagement or
   neglect on Christ's part from temporary mishaps, but to have firm faith
   in His wise and loving care for His cause and people, and to anticipate
   a happy issue out of all perplexities; yea, to glory in tribulation,
   because of the great deliverance which would surely follow.

   Such strong faith the disciples were far enough from possessing at the
   time of the storm. They had no expectation that Jesus would come to
   their rescue; for when He did come, they though He was a spirit
   flitting over the water, and cried out in an agony of superstitious
   terror. Here also we note, in passing, a curious correspondence between
   the incidents of this crisis and those connected with the final one.
   The disciples had then as little expectation of seeing their Lord
   return from the dead as they had now of seeing Him come to them over
   the sea; and therefore His re-appearance at first frightened rather
   than comforted them. "They were terrified and affrighted, and supposed
   that they had seen a spirit." [222] Good, unlooked for in either case,
   was turned into evil; and what to faith would have been a source of
   intense joy, became, through unbelief, only a new cause of alarm.

   The fact of His not being expected seems to have imposed on Jesus the
   necessity of using artifice in His manner of approaching His
   storm-tossed disciples. Mark relates that "He would have passed by
   then," [223] affecting strangeness, as we understand it, out of
   delicate consideration for their weakness. He knew what He would be
   taken for when first observed; and therefore He wished to attract their
   attention at a safe distance, fearing lest, by appearing among them at
   once, He might drive them distracted. He found it needful to be as
   cautious in announcing His advent to save as men are wont to be in
   communicating evil tidings: first appearing, as the spectre, as far
   away as He could be seen; then revealing Himself by His familiar voice
   uttering the words of comfort, "It is I; be not afraid," and so
   obtaining at length a willing reception into the ship. [224]

   The effects which followed the admission of Jesus into the vessel
   betrayed the twelve into a new manifestation of the weakness of their
   faith. "The wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond
   measure, and wondered." [225] They ought not to have wondered so
   greatly, after what had happened once before on these same waters, and
   especially after such a miracle as had been wrought in the wilderness
   on the previous day. But the storm had blown all thoughts of such
   things out of their mind, and driven them utterly stupid. "They
   reflected not on the loaves (nor on the rebuking of the winds), for
   their heart was hardened." [226]

   But the most interesting revelation of the mental state of the
   disciples at the time when Jesus came to their relief, is to be found
   in the episode concerning Peter related in Matthew's Gospel. When that
   disciple understood that the supposed spectre was his beloved Master,
   he cried, "Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the water;"
   [227] and on receiving permission, he forthwith stepped out of the ship
   into the sea. This was not faith, but simple rashness. It was the
   rebound of an impetuous, headlong nature from one extreme of utter
   despair to the opposite extreme of extravagant, reckless joy. What in
   the other disciples took the tame form of a willingness to receive
   Jesus into the ship, after they were satisfied it was He who walked on
   the waters, [228] took, in the case of Peter, the form of a romantic,
   adventurous wish to go out to Jesus where He was, to welcome Him back
   among them again. The proposal was altogether like the man -- generous,
   enthusiastic, and well-meant, but inconsiderate.

   Such a proposal, of course, could not meet with Christ's approval, and
   yet He did not negative it. He rather thought good to humor the
   impulsive disciple so far, by inviting him to come, and then to allow
   him, while in the water, to feel his own weakness. Thus would He teach
   him a little self-knowledge, and, if possible, save him from the
   effects of his rash, self-confident temper. But Peter was not to be
   made wise by one lesson, nor even by several. He would go on blundering
   and erring, in spite of rebuke and warning, till at length he fell into
   grievous sin, denying the Master whom he loved so well. The denial at
   the final crisis was just what might be looked for from one who so
   behaved at the minor crisis preceding it. The man who said, "Bid me
   come to Thee," was just the man to say, "Lord, I am ready to go with
   Thee both into prison and to death." He who was so courageous on deck,
   and so timid amid the waves, was the one of all the disciples most
   likely to talk boldly when danger was not at hand, and then play the
   coward when the hour of trial actually arrived. The scene on the lake
   was but a foreshadowing or rehearsal of Peter's fall.

   And yet that scene showed something more than the weakness of that
   disciple's faith. It showed also what is possible to those who believe.
   If the tendency of weak faith be to sink, the triumph of strong faith
   is to walk on the waves, glorying in tribulation, and counting it all
   joy when exposed to divers temptations. It is the privilege of those
   who are weak in faith, and the duty of all, mindful of human frailty,
   to pray, "Lead us not into temptation." But when storms come not of
   their inviting, and when their ship is upset in midst of the sea, then
   may Christians trust to the promise, "When thou passest through the
   waters, I will be with thee;." and if only they have faith, they shall
   be enabled to tread the rolling billows as if walking on firm land.


   "He bids me come; His voice I know,

   And boldly on the waters go,

   And brave the tempest's shock.

   O'er rude temptations now I bound;

   The billows yield a solid ground,

   The wave is firm as rock."

  SECTION III. THE SERMON

    John vi. 32-58.

   The task now before us is to study that memorable address delivered by
   Jesus in the synagogue of Capernaum on the bread of life, which gave so
   great offence at the time, and which has ever since been a stone of
   stumbling, a subject of controversy, and a cause of division in the
   visible church, and, so far as one can judge from present appearances,
   will be to the world's end. On a question so vexed as that which
   relates to the meaning of this discourse, one might well shrink from
   entering. But the very confusion which prevails here points it out as
   our plain duty to disregard the din of conflicting interpretations,
   and, humbly praying to be taught of God, to search for and set forth
   Christ's own mind.

   The sermon on the bread of life, however strangely it sounds, was
   appropriate both in matter and manner to the circumstances in which it
   was delivered. It was natural and seasonable that Jesus should speak to
   the people of the meat that endureth unto everlasting life after
   miraculously providing perishable food to supply their physical wants.
   It was even natural and seasonable that He should speak of this high
   topic in the startling, apparently gross, harsh style which He adopted
   on the occasion. The form of thought suited the situation. Passover
   time was approaching, when the paschal lamb was slain and eaten; and if
   Jesus desired to say in effect, without saying it in so many words, "I
   am the true Paschal Lamb," what more suitable form of language could He
   employ than this: "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will
   give for the life of the world"? The style was also adapted to the
   peculiar complexion of the speaker's feelings at the moment. Jesus was
   in a sad, austere mood when He preached this sermon. The foolish
   enthusiasm of the multitude had saddened Him. Their wish to force a
   crown on His head made Him think of His cross; for He knew that this
   idolatrous devotion to a political Messiah meant death sooner or later
   to one who declined such carnal homage. He spoke, therefore, in the
   synagogue of Capernaum with Calvary in view, setting Himself forth as
   the life of the world in terms applicable to a sacrificial victim,
   whose blood is shed, and whose flesh is eaten by those presenting the
   offering; not mincing His words, but saying every thing in the
   strongest and intensest manner possible.

   The theme of this memorable address was very naturally introduced by
   the preceding conversation between Jesus and the people who came from
   the other side of the lake, hoping to find Him at Capernaum, His usual
   place of abode. [229] To their warm inquiries as to how He came
   thither, He replied by a chilling observation concerning the true
   motive of their zeal, and an exhortation to set their hearts on a
   higher food than that which perisheth. [230] Understanding the
   exhortation as a counsel to cultivate piety, the persons to whom it was
   addressed inquired what they should do that they might work the works
   of God, i.e. please God. [231] Jesus replied by declaring that the
   great testing work of the hour was to receive Himself as one whom God
   had sent. [232] This led to a demand on their part for evidence in
   support of this high claim to be the divinely missioned Messiah. The
   miracle just wrought on the other side of the lake was great, but not
   great enough, they thought, to justify such lofty pretensions. In
   ancient times a whole nation had been fed for many years by bread
   brought down from heaven by Moses. What was the recent miracle compared
   to that? He must show a sign on a far grander scale, if He wished them
   to believe that a greater than Moses was here. [233] Jesus took up the
   challenge, and boldly declared that the manna, wonderful as it was, was
   not the true heavenly bread. There was another bread, of which the
   manna was but the type: like it, coming down from heaven; [234] but
   unlike it, giving life not to a nation, but to a world, and not life
   merely for a few short years, but life for eternity. This announcement,
   like the similar one concerning the wonderful water of life made to the
   woman of Samaria, provoked desire in the hearts of the hearers, and
   they exclaimed, "Lord, evermore give us this bread." Then said Jesus
   unto them, "I am the bread of life: he that cometh unto me shall never
   hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst." [235]

   In these words Jesus briefly enunciated the doctrine of the true bread,
   which He expounded and inculcated in His memorable Capernaum discourse.
   The doctrine, as stated, sets forth what the true bread is, what it
   does, and how it is appropriated.

   I. The true bread is He who here speaks of it -- Jesus Christ. "I am
   the bread." The assertion implies, on the speaker's part, a claim to
   have descended from heaven; for such a descent is one of the properties
   by which the true bread is defined. [236] Accordingly we find Jesus, in
   the sequel of His discourse, expressly asserting that He had come down
   from heaven. [237] This declaration, understood in a supernatural
   sense, was the first thing in His discourse with which His hearers
   found fault. "The Jews then murmured at Him, because He said, I am the
   bread which came down from heaven. And they said, Is not this Jesus,
   the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that
   He saith, I came down from heaven?" [238] It was natural they should
   murmur if they did not know or believe that there was any thing out of
   course in the way in which Jesus came into the world. For such language
   as He here employs could not be used without blasphemy by a mere man
   born after the fashion of other men. It is language proper only in the
   mouth of a Divine Being who, for a purpose, hath assumed human nature.

   In setting Himself forth, therefore, as the bread which came down from
   heaven, Jesus virtually taught the doctrine of the incarnation. The
   solemn assertion, "I am the bread of life," is equivalent in import to
   that made by the evangelist respecting Him who spoke these words: "The
   Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth." [239]

   It is, however, not merely as incarnate that the Son of God is the
   bread of eternal life. Bread must be broken in order to be eaten. The
   Incarnate One must die as a sacrificial victim that men may truly feed
   upon Him. The Word become flesh, and crucified in the flesh, is the
   life of the world. This special truth Jesus went on to declare, after
   having stated the general truth that the heavenly bread was to be found
   in Himself. "The bread," said He, "that I will give is my flesh, (which
   I will give) for the life of the world." [240] The language here
   becomes modified to suit the new turn of thought. "I am" passes into "I
   will give," and "bread" is transformed into "flesh."

   Jesus evidently refers here to His death. His hearers did not so
   understand Him, but we can have no doubt on the matter. The verb
   "give," suggesting a sacrificial act, and the future tense both point
   that way. In words dark and mysterious before the event, clear as day
   after it, the speaker declares the great truth, that His death is to be
   the life of men; that His broken body and shed blood are to be as meat
   and drink to a perishing world, conferring on all who shall partake of
   them the gift of immortality. How He is to die, and why His death shall
   possess such virtue, He does not here explain. The Capernaum discourse
   makes no mention of the cross; it contains no theory of atonement, the
   time is not come for such details; it simply asserts in broad, strong
   terms that the flesh and blood of the incarnate Son of God, severed as
   in death, are the source of eternal life.

   This mention by Jesus of His flesh as the bread from heaven gave rise
   to a new outburst of murmuring among His hearers. "They strove among
   themselves, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat?" [241]
   Jesus had not yet said that His flesh must be eaten, but they took for
   granted that such was His meaning. They were right; and accordingly He
   went on to say, with the greatest solemnity and emphasis, that they
   must even eat His flesh and drink His blood. Unless they did that, they
   should have no life in them; if they did that, they should have life in
   all its fulness -- life eternal both in body and in soul. For His flesh
   was the true food, and His blood was the true drink. They who partook
   of these would share in His own life. He should dwell in them,
   incorporated with their very being; and they should dwell in Him as the
   ground of their being. They should live as secure against death by Him,
   as He lived from everlasting to everlasting by the Father. "This,
   therefore," said the speaker, reverting in conclusion to the
   proposition with which he started, "this (even my flesh) is that bread
   which came down from Heaven; not as your fathers did eat manna and are
   dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live forever." [242]

   A third expression of disapprobation ensuing led Jesus to put the
   copestone on His high doctrine of the bread of life, by making a
   concluding declaration, which must have appeared at the time the most
   mysterious and unintelligible of all: that the bread which descended
   from heaven must ascend up thither again, in order to be to the full
   extent the bread of everlasting life. Doth this offend you? asked He at
   his hearers: this which I have just said about your eating my flesh and
   blood; what will ye say "if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where
   He was before?" [243] The question was in effect an affirmation, and it
   was also a prophetic hint, that only after He had left the world would
   He become on an extensive scale and conspicuously a source of life to
   men; because then the manna of grace would begin to descend not only on
   the wilderness of Israel, but on all the barren places of the earth;
   and the truth in Him, the doctrine of His life, death, and
   resurrection, would become meat indeed and drink indeed unto a
   multitude, not of murmuring hearers, but of devout, enlightened,
   thankful believers; and no one would need any longer to ask for a sign
   when he could find in the Christian church, continuing steadfastly in
   the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking bread and in
   prayers, the best evidence that He had spoken truth who said, "I am the
   bread of life."

   2. This, then, is the heavenly bread: even the God-man incarnate,
   crucified, and glorified. Let us now consider more attentively the
   marvellous virtue of this bread. It is the bread of life. It is the
   office of all bread to sustain life, but it is the peculiarity of this
   divine bread to give eternal life. "He that cometh to me," said the
   speaker, "shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, shall never
   thirst." [244] With reference to this life-giving power He called the
   bread of which He spake "living bread," and meat indeed, and declared
   that he who ate thereof should not die, but should live forever. [245]

   In commending this miraculous bread to His hearers, Jesus, we observe,
   laid special stress on its power to give eternal life even to the body
   of man. Four times over He declared in express terms that all who
   partook of this bread of life should be raised again at the last day.
   [246] The prominence thus given to the resurrection of the body is due
   in part to the fact that throughout His discourse Jesus was drawing a
   contrast between the manna which fed the Israelites in the desert and
   the true bread of which it was the type. The contrast was most striking
   just at this point. The manna was merely a substitute for ordinary
   food; it had no power to ward off death: the generation which had been
   so miraculously supported passed away from the earth, like all other
   generations of mankind. Therefore, argued Jesus, it could not be the
   true bread from heaven; for the true bread must be capable of
   destroying death, and endowing the recipients with the power of an
   endless existence. A man who eats thereof must not die; or dying, must
   rise again. "Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are
   dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may
   eat thereof, and not die." [247]

   But the prominence given to the resurrection of the body is due mainly
   to its intrinsic importance. For if the dead rise not, then is our
   faith vain, and the bread of life degenerates into a mere quack
   nostrum, pretending to virtues which it does not possess. True, it may
   still give spiritual life to those who eat thereof, but what is that
   without the hope of a life hereafter? Not much, according to Paul, who
   says, "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
   most miserable." [248] Many, indeed, in our day do not concur in the
   apostle's judgment. They think that the doctrine of the life
   everlasting may be left out of the creed without loss -- nay, even with
   positive advantage, to the Christian faith. The life of a Christian
   seems to them so much nobler when all thought of future reward or
   punishment is dismissed from the mind. How grand, to pass through the
   wilderness of this world feeding on the manna supplied in the high,
   pure teaching of Jesus, without caring whether there be a land of
   Canaan on the other side of Jordan! Very sublime indeed! but why, in
   that case, come into the wilderness at all? why not remain in Egypt,
   feeding on more substantial and palatable viands? The children of
   Israel would not have left the house of bondage unless they had hoped
   to reach the promised land. An immortal hope is equally necessary to
   the Christian. He must believe in a world to come in order to live
   above the present evil world. If Christ cannot redeem the body from the
   power of the grave, then it is in vain that He promises to redeem us
   from guilt and sin. The bread of life is unworthy of the name, unless
   it hath power to cope with physical as well as with moral corruption.

   Hence the prominence given by Jesus in this discourse to the
   resurrection of the body. He knew that here lay the crucial experiment
   by which the value and virtue of the bread He offered to His hearers
   must be tested. "You call this bread the bread of life, in contrast to
   the manna of ancient times: -- do you mean to say that, like the tree
   of life in the garden of Eden, it will confer on those who eat thereof
   the gift of a blessed immortality?" "Yes, I do," replied the Preacher
   in effect to this imaginary question: "this bread I offer you will not
   merely quicken the soul to a higher, purer life; it will even revivify
   your bodies, and make the corruptible put on incorruption, and the
   mortal put on immortality."

   3. And how, then, is this wondrous bread to be appropriated that one
   may experience its vitalizing influences? Bread, of course, is eaten;
   but what does eating in this case mean? It means, in one word, faith.
   "He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in me
   shall never thirst." [249] Eating Christ's flesh and drinking His
   blood, and, we may add, drinking the water of which he spake to the
   woman by the well, all signify believing in Him as He is offered to men
   in the gospel: the Son of God manifested in the flesh, crucified,
   raised from the dead, ascended into glory; the Prophet, the Priest, the
   King, and the Mediator between God and man. Throughout the Capernaum
   discourse eating and believing are used interchangeably as equivalents.
   Thus, in one sentence, we find Jesus saying, "Verily, verily, I say
   unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life: I am that
   bread of life;." [250] and shortly after remarking,: "I am the living
   bread which came down from heaven: If any man eat of this bread he
   shall live forever." [251] If any further argument were necessary to
   justify the identifying of eating with believing, it might be found in
   the instruction given by the Preacher to His hearers before He began to
   speak of the bread of life; "This is the work of God, that ye believe
   on Him whom He hath sent." [252] That sentence furnishes the key to the
   interpretation of the whole subsequent discourse. "Believe," said
   Jesus, with reference to the foregoing inquiry, What shall we do, that
   we might work the works of God? -- "Believe, and thou hast done God's
   work." "Believe," we may understand Him as saying with reference to an
   inquiry, How shall we eat this bread of life? -- "Believe, and thou
   hast eaten."

   Believe, and thou hast eaten: such was the formula in which Augustine
   expressed his view of Christ's meaning in the Capernaum discourse.
   [253] The saying is not only terse, but true, in our judgment; but it
   has not been accepted by all interpreters. Many hold that eating and
   faith are something distinct, and would express the relation between
   them thus: Believe, and thou shalt eat. Even Calvin objected to the
   Augustinian formula. Distinguishing his own views from those held by
   the followers of Zwingli, he says: "To them to eat is simply to
   believe. I say that Christ's flesh is eaten in believing because it is
   made ours by faith, and that eating is the fruit and effect of faith.
   Or more clearly: To them eating is faith, to me it seems rather to
   follow from faith." [254]

   The distinction taken by Calvin between eating and believing seems to
   have been verbal rather than real. With many other theologians,
   however, it is far otherwise. All upholders of the magical doctrines of
   transubstantiation and consubstantiation contend for the literal
   interpretation of the Capernaum discourse even in its strongest
   statements. Eating Christ's flesh and drinking His blood are, for such,
   acts of the mouth, accompanied perhaps with acts of faith, but not
   merely acts of faith. It is assumed for the most part as a matter of
   course, that the discourse recorded in the sixth chapter of John's
   Gospel has reference to the sacrament of the Supper, and that only on
   the hypothesis of such a reference can the peculiar phraseology of the
   discourse be explained. Christ spoke then of eating His flesh and
   drinking His blood, so we are given to understand, because He had in
   His mind that mystic rite ere long to be instituted, in which bread and
   wine should not merely represent, but become, the constituent elements
   of His crucified body.

   While the sermon on the bread of life continues to be mixed up with
   sacramentarian controversies, agreement in its interpretation is
   altogether hopeless. Meantime, till a better day dawn on a divided and
   distracted church, every man must endeavor to be fully persuaded in his
   own mind. Three things are clear to our mind. First, it is incorrect to
   say that the sermon delivered in the Capernaum synagogue refers to the
   sacrament of the Supper. The true state of the case is, that both refer
   to a third thing, viz. the death of Christ, and both declare, in
   different ways, the same thing concerning it. The sermon says in
   symbolic words what the Supper says in a symbolic act: that Christ
   crucified is the life of men, the world's hope of salvation. The sermon
   says more than this, for it speaks of Christ's ascension as well as of
   His death; but it says this for one thing.

   A second point on which we are clear is, that it is quite unnecessary
   to assume a mental reference by anticipation to the Holy Supper, in
   order to account for the peculiarity of Christ's language in this
   famous discourse. As we saw at the beginning, the whole discourse rose
   naturally out of the present situation. The mention by the people of
   the manna naturally led Jesus to speak of the bread of life; and from
   the bread He passed on as naturally to speak of the flesh and the
   blood, because he could not fully be bread until He had become flesh
   and blood dissevered, i.e. until He had endured death. All that we find
   here might have been said, in fact, although the sacrament of the
   Supper had never existed. The Supper is of use not so much for
   interpreting the sermon as for establishing its credibility as an
   authentic utterance of Jesus. There is no reason to doubt that He who
   instituted the mystic feast, could also have preached this mystic
   sermon.

   The third truth which shines clear as a star to our eye is, -- that
   through faith alone we may attain all the blessings of salvation.
   Sacraments are very useful, but they are not necessary. If it had
   pleased Christ not to institute them, we could have got to heaven
   notwithstanding. Because He has instituted them, it is our duty to
   celebrate them, and we may expect benefit from their celebration. But
   the benefit we receive is simply an aid to faith, and nothing which
   cannot be received by faith. Christians eat the flesh and drink the
   blood of the Son of man at all times, not merely at communion times,
   simply by believing in Him. They eat His flesh and drink His blood at
   His table in the same sense as at other times; only perchance in a
   livelier manner, their hearts being stirred up to devotion by
   remembrance of His dying love, and their faith aided by seeing,
   handling, and tasting the bread and the wine.

  SECTION IV. THE SIFTING

    John vi. 66-71.

   The sermon on the bread of life produced decisive effects. It converted
   popular enthusiasm for Jesus into disgust; like a fan, it separated
   true from false disciples; and like a winnowing breeze, it blew the
   chaff away, leaving a small residuum of wheat behind. "From that time
   many of His disciples went back, and walked no more with Him."

   This result did not take Jesus by surprise. He expected it; in a sense,
   He wished it, though He was deeply grieved by it. For while His large,
   loving human heart yearned for the salvation of all, and desired that
   all should come and get life, He wanted none to come to Him under
   misapprehension, or to follow Him from by-ends. He sought disciples
   God-given, [255] God-drawn, [256] God-taught, [257] knowing that such
   alone would continue in His word. [258] He was aware that in the large
   mass of people who had recently followed Him were many disciples of
   quite another description; and He was not unwilling that the mixed
   multitude should be sifted. Therefore He preached that mystic
   discourse, fitted to be a savor of life or of death according to the
   spiritual state of the hearer. Therefore, also, when offence was taken
   at the doctrine taught, He plainly declared the true cause, [259] and
   expressed His assurance that only those whom His Father taught and drew
   would or could really come unto Him. [260] These things He said not
   with a view to irritate, but He deemed it right to say them though they
   should give rise to irritation, reckoning that true believers would
   take all in good part, and that those who took umbrage would thereby
   reveal their true character.

   The apostatizing disciples doubtless thought themselves fully justified
   in withdrawing from the society of Jesus. They turned their back on
   Him, we fancy, in most virtuous indignation, saying in their hearts --
   nay, probably saying aloud to one another: "Who ever heard the like of
   that? how absurd! how revolting! The man who can speak thus is either a
   fool, or is trying to make fools of his hearers." And yet the hardness
   of His doctrine was not the real reason which led so many to forsake
   Him; it was simply the pretext, the most plausible and respectable
   reason that they could assign for conduct springing from other motives.
   The grand offence of Jesus was this: He was not the man they had taken
   Him for; He was not going to be at their service to promote the ends
   they had in view. Whatever He meant by the bread of life, or by eating
   His flesh, it was plain that He was not going to be a bread-king,
   making it His business to furnish supplies for their physical
   appetites, ushering in a golden age of idleness and plenty. That
   ascertained, it was all over with Him so far as they were concerned: He
   might offer His heavenly food to whom He pleased; they wanted none of
   it.

   Deeply affected by the melancholy sight of so many human beings
   deliberately preferring material good to eternal life, Jesus turned to
   the twelve, and said, "Will ye also go away?" or more exactly, "You do
   not wish to go away too, do you?" [261] The question may be understood
   as a virtual expression of confidence in the persons to whom it was
   addressed, and as an appeal to them for sympathy at a discouraging
   crisis. And yet, while a negative answer was expected to the question,
   it was not expected as a matter of course. Jesus was not without
   solicitude concerning the fidelity even of the twelve. He interrogated
   them, as conscious that they were placed in trying circumstances, and
   that if they did not actually forsake Him now, as at the great final
   crisis, they were at least tempted to be offended in Him.

   A little reflection suffices to satisfy us that the twelve were indeed
   placed in a position at this time calculated to try their faith most
   severely. For one thing, the mere fact of their Master being deserted
   wholesale by the crowd of quondam admirers and followers involved for
   the chosen band a temptation to apostasy. How mighty is the power of
   sympathy! how ready are we all to follow the multitude, regardless of
   the way they are going! and how much moral courage it requires to stand
   alone! How difficult to witness the spectacle of thousands, or even
   hundreds, going off in sullen disaffection, without feeling an impulse
   to imitate their bad example! how hard to keep one's self from being
   carried along with the powerful tide of adverse popular opinion!
   Especially hard it must have been for the twelve to resist the tendency
   to apostatize if, as is more than probable, they sympathized with the
   project entertained by the multitude when their enthusiasm for Jesus
   was at full-tide. If it would have gratified them to have seen their
   beloved Master made king by popular acclamation, how their spirits must
   have sunk when the bubble burst, and the would-be subjects of the
   Messianic Prince were dispersed like an idle mob, and the kingdom which
   had seemed so near vanished like a cloudland!

   Another circumstance trying to the faith of the twelve was the strange,
   mysterious character of their Master's discourse in the synagogue of
   Capernaum. That discourse contained hard, repulsive, unintelligible
   sayings for them quite as much as for the rest of the audience. Of this
   we can have no doubt when we consider the repugnance with which some
   time afterward they received the announcement that Jesus was destined
   to be put to death. [262] If they objected even to the fact of His
   death, how could they understand its meaning, especially when both fact
   and meaning were spoken of in such a veiled and mystic style as that
   which pervades the sermon on the bread of life? While, therefore, they
   believed that their Master had the words of eternal life, and perceived
   that His late discourse bore on that high theme, it may be regarded as
   certain that the twelve did not understand the words spoken any more
   than the multitude, however much they might try to do so. They knew not
   what connection existed between Christ's flesh and eternal life, how
   eating that flesh could confer any benefit, or even what eating it
   might mean. They had quite lost sight of the Speaker in His eagle
   flight of thought; and they must have looked on in distress as the
   people melted away, painfully conscious that they could not altogether
   blame them.

   Yet, however greatly tempted to forsake their Master, the twelve did
   abide faithfully by His side. They did come safely through the
   spiritual storm. What was the secret of their steadfastness? what were
   the anchors that preserved them from shipwreck? These questions are of
   practical interest to all who, like the apostles at this crisis, are
   tempted to apostasy by evil example or by religious doubt; by the
   fashion of the world they live in, whether scientific or illiterate,
   refined or rustic; or by the deep things of God, whether these be the
   mysteries of providence, the mysteries of revelation, or the mysteries
   of religious experience: we may say, indeed, to all genuine Christians,
   for what Christian has not been tempted in one or other of these ways
   at some period in his history?

   Sufficient materials for answering these questions are supplied in the
   words of Simon Peter's response to Jesus. As spokesman for the whole
   company, that disciple promptly said: "Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou
   hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and know that Thou art
   that Christ, the son of the living God," [263] or, according to the
   reading preferred by most critics, "that Thou art the Holy One of God."
   [264]

   Three anchors, we infer from these words, helped the twelve to ride out
   the storm: Religious earnestness or sincerity; a clear perception of
   the alternatives before them; and implicit confidence in the character
   and attachment to the person of their Master.

   I. The twelve, as a body, were sincere and thoroughly in earnest in
   religion. Their supreme desire was to know "the words of eternal life,"
   and actually to gain possession of that life. Their concern was not
   about the meat that perisheth, but about the higher heavenly food of
   the soul which Christ had in vain exhorted the majority of His hearers
   to labor for. As yet they knew not clearly wherein that food consisted,
   but according to their light they sincerely prayed, "Lord, evermore
   give us this bread." Hence it was no disappointment to them that Jesus
   declined to become a purveyor of mere material food: they had never
   expected or wished Him to do so; they had joined His company with
   entirely different expectations. A certain element of error might be
   mingled with truth in their conceptions of His Mission, but the gross,
   carnal hopes of the multitude had no place in their breasts. They
   became not disciples to better their worldly circumstances, but to
   obtain a portion which the world could neither give them nor take from
   them.

   What we have now stated was true of all the twelve save one; and the
   crisis we are at present considering is memorable for this, among other
   things, that it was the first occasion on which Jesus gave a hint that
   there was a false disciple among the men whom He had chosen. To justify
   Himself for asking a question which seemed to cast a doubt upon their
   fidelity, He replied to Peter's protestation by the startling remark:
   "Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil?" [265] as
   if to say: "It is painful to me to have to use this language of
   suspicion, but I have good cause: there is one among you who has had
   thoughts of desertion, and who is capable even of treachery." With what
   sadness of spirit must He have made such an intimation at this crisis!
   To be forsaken by the fickle crowd of shallow, thoughtless followers
   had been a small matter, could He have reckoned all the members of the
   select band good men and true friends. But to have an enemy in one's
   own house, a diabolus capable of playing Satan's part in one's small
   circle of intimate companions: -- it was hard indeed!

   But how could a man destined to be a traitor, and deserving to be
   stigmatized as a devil, manage to pass creditably through the present
   crisis? Does not the fact seem to imply that, after all, it is possible
   to be steadfast without being single-minded? Not so; the only
   legitimate inference is, that the crisis was not searching enough to
   bring out the true character of Judas. Wait till you see the end. A
   little religion will carry a man through many trials, but there is an
   experimentum crucis which nothing but sincerity can stand. If the mind
   be double, or the heart divided, a time comes that compels men to act
   according to the motives that are deepest and strongest in them. This
   remark applies especially to creative, revolutionary, or transition
   epochs. In quiet times a hypocrite may pass respectably through this
   world, and never be detected till he get to the next, whither his sins
   follow him to judgment. But in critical eras the sins of the
   double-minded find them out in this life. True, even then some
   double-minded men can stand more temptation than others, and are not to
   be bought so cheaply as the common herd. But all of them have their
   price, and those who fall less easily than others fall in the end most
   deeply and tragically.

   Of the character and fall of Judas we shall have another opportunity to
   speak. Our present object is simply to point out that from such as he
   Jesus did not expect constancy. By referring to that disciple as He
   did, He intimated His conviction that no one in whom the love of God
   and truth was not the deepest principle of his being would continue
   faithful to the end. In effect He inculcated the necessity, in order to
   steadfastness in faith, of moral integrity, or godly sincerity.

   2. The second anchor by which the disciples were kept from shipwreck at
   this season was a clear perception of the alternatives. "To whom shall
   we go?" asked Peter, as one who saw that, for men having in view the
   aim pursued by himself and his brethren, there was no course open but
   to remain where they were. He had gone over rapidly in his mind all the
   possible alternatives, and this was the conclusion at which he had
   arrived. "To whom shall we go -- we who seek eternal life? John, our
   former master, is dead; and even were he alive, he would send us back
   to Thee. Or shall we go to the scribes and Pharisees? We have been too
   long with Thee for that; for Thou hast taught us the superficiality,
   the hypocrisy, the ostentatiousness, the essential ungodliness of their
   religious system. Or shall we follow the fickle multitude there, and
   relapse into stupidity and indifference? It is not to be thought of.
   Or, finally, shall we go to the Sadducees, the idolaters of the
   material and the temporal, who say there is no resurrection, neither
   any angels nor spirits? God forbid! That were to renounce a hope dearer
   than life, without which life to an earnest mind were a riddle, a
   contradiction, and an intolerable burden."

   We may understand what a help this clear perception of the alternatives
   was to Peter and his brethren, by reflecting on the help we ourselves
   might derive from the same source when tempted by dogmatic difficulties
   to renounce Christianity. It would make one pause if he understood that
   the alternatives open to him were to abide with Christ, or to become an
   atheist, ignoring God and the world to come; that when he leaves
   Christ, he must go to school to some of the great masters of
   thoroughgoing unbelief. In the works of a well-known German author is a
   dream, which portrays with appalling vividness the consequences that
   would ensue throughout the universe should the Creator cease to exist.
   The dream was invented, so the gifted writer tells us, for the purpose
   of frightening those who discussed the being of God as coolly as if the
   question respected the existence of the Kraken or the unicorn, and also
   to check all atheistic thoughts which might arise in his own bosom. "If
   ever," he says, "my heart should be so unhappy and deadened as to have
   all those feelings which affirm the being of a God destroyed, I would
   use this dream to frighten myself, and so heal my heart, and restore
   its lost feelings." [266] Such benefit as Richter expected from the
   perusal of his own dream, would any one, tempted to renounce
   Christianity, derive from a clear perception that in ceasing to be a
   Christian he must make up his mind to accept a creed which acknowledges
   no God, no soul, no hereafter.

   Unfortunately it is not so easy for us now as it was for Peter to see
   clearly what the alternatives before us are. Few are so clear-sighted,
   so recklessly logical, or so frank as the late Dr. Strauss, who in his
   latest publication. The Old and the New Faith, plainly says that he is
   no longer a Christian. Hence many in our day call themselves Christians
   whose theory of the universe (or Weltanschauung, as the Germans call
   it) does not allow them to believe in the miraculous in any shape or in
   any sphere; with whom it is an axiom that the continuity of nature's
   course cannot be broken, and who therefore cannot even go the length of
   Socinians in their view of Christ and declare Him to be, without
   qualification, the Holy One of God, the morally sinless One. Even men
   like Renan claim to be Christians, and, like Balaam, bless Him whom
   their philosophy compels them to blame. Our modern Balaams all confess
   that Jesus is at least the holiest of men, if not the absolutely Holy
   One. They are constrained to bless the Man of Nazareth. They are
   spellbound by the Star of Bethlehem, as was the Eastern soothsayer by
   the Star of Jacob, and are forced to say in effect: "How shall I curse,
   whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not
   defied? Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and He hath
   blessed; and I cannot reverse it." [267] Others not going so far as
   Renan, shrinking from thoroughgoing naturalism, believing in a perfect
   Christ, a moral miracle, yet affect a Christianity independent of
   dogma, and as little as possible encumbered by miracle, a Christianity
   purely ethical, consisting mainly in admiration of Christ's character
   and moral teaching; and, as the professors of such a Christianity,
   regard themselves as exemplary disciples of Christ. Such are the men of
   whom the author of Supernatural Religion speaks as characterized by a
   "tendency to eliminate from Christianity, with thoughtless dexterity,
   every supernatural element which does not quite accord with current
   opinions," and as endeavoring "to arrest for a moment the pursuing
   wolves of doubt and unbelief by practically throwing to them scrap by
   scrap the very doctrines which constitute the claims of Christianity to
   be regarded as a divine revelation at all." [268] Such men can hardly
   be said to have a consistent theory of the universe, for they hold
   opinions based on incompatible theories, are naturalistic in tendency,
   yet will not carry out naturalism to all its consequences. They are
   either not able, or are disinclined, to realize the alternatives and to
   obey the voice of logic, which like a stern policeman bids them "Move
   on;." but would rather hold views which unite the alternatives in one
   compound eclectic creed, like Schleiermacher, -- himself an excellent
   example of the class, -- of whom Strauss remarks that he ground down
   Christianity and Pantheism to powder, and so mixed them that it is hard
   to say where Pantheism ends and Christianity begins. In presence of
   such a spirit of compromise, so widespread, and recommended by the
   example of many men of ability and influence, it requires some courage
   to have and hold a definite position, or to resist the temptation to
   yield to the current and adopt the watchword: Christianity without
   dogma and miracle. But perhaps it will be easier by and by to realize
   the alternatives, when time has more clearly shown whither present
   tendencies lead. Meantime it is the evening twilight, and for the
   moment it seems as if we could do without the sun, for though he is
   below the horizon, the air is still full of light. But wait awhile; and
   the deepening of the twilight into the darkness of night will show how
   far Christ the Holy One of the Church's confession can be dispensed
   with as the Sun of the spiritual world.

   3. The third anchor whereby the twelve were enabled to ride out the
   storm, was confidence in the character of their Master. They believed,
   yea, they knew, that He was the Holy One of God. They had been with
   Jesus long enough to have come to very decided conclusions respecting
   Him. They had seen Him work many miracles; they had heard Him discourse
   with marvellous wisdom, in parable and sermon, on the divine kingdom;
   they had observed His wondrously tender, gracious concern for the low
   and the lost; they had been present at His various encounters with
   Pharisees, and had noted His holy abhorrence of their falsehood, pride,
   vanity, and tyranny. All this blessed fellowship had begotten a
   confidence in, and reverence for, their beloved Master, too strong to
   be shaken by a single address containing some statements of an
   incomprehensible character, couched in questionable or even offensive
   language. Their intellect might be perplexed, but their heart remained
   true; and hence, while others who knew not Jesus well went off in
   disgust, they continued by His side, feeling that such a friend and
   guide was not to be parted with for a trifle.

   "We believe and know," said Peter. He believed because he knew. Such
   implicit confidence as the twelve had in Jesus is possible only through
   intimate knowledge; for one cannot thus trust a stranger. All,
   therefore, who desire to get the benefit of this trust, must be willing
   to spend time and take trouble to get into the heart of the Gospel
   story, and of its great subject. The sure anchorage is not attainable
   by a listless, random reading of the evangelic narratives, but by a
   close, careful, prayerful study, pursued it may be for years. Those who
   grudge the trouble are in imminent danger of the fate which befell the
   ignorant multitude, being liable to be thrown into panic by every new
   infidel book, or to be scandalized by every strange utterance of the
   Object of faith. Those, on the other hand, who do take the trouble,
   will be rewarded for their pains. Storm-tossed for a time, they shall
   at length reach the harbor of a creed which is no nondescript
   compromise between infidelity and scriptural Christianity, but embraces
   all the cardinal facts and truths of the faith, as taught by Jesus in
   the Capernaum discourse, and as afterwards taught by the men who passed
   safely through the Capernaum crisis.

   May God in His mercy guide all souls now out in the tempestuous sea of
   doubt into that haven of rest!

  10. THE LEAVEN OF THE PHARISEES AND SADDUCES

    Matt. 16:1-12; Mark 8:10-21.

   This new collision between Jesus and His opponents took place shortly
   after a second miracle of feeding similar to that performed in the
   neighborhood of Bethsaida Julias. What interval of time elapsed between
   the two miracles cannot be ascertained; [269] but it was long enough to
   admit of an extended journey on the part of our Lord and His disciples
   to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, the scene of the pathetic meeting with
   the Syrophenician woman, and round from thence through the region of
   the ten cities, on the eastern border of the Galilean lake. It was long
   enough also to allow the cause and the fame of Jesus to recover from
   the low state to which they sank after the sifting sermon in the
   synagogue of Capernaum. The unpopular One had again become popular, so
   that on arriving at the south-eastern shore of the lake He found
   Himself attended by thousands, so intent on hearing Him preach, and on
   experiencing His healing power, that they remained with Him three days,
   almost, if not entirely, without food, thus creating a necessity for
   the second miraculous repast.

   After the miracle on the south-eastern shore, Jesus, we read, sent away
   the multitude; and taking ship, came into the coasts of Magdala, on the
   western side of the sea. [270] It was on His arrival there that He
   encountered the party who came seeking of Him a sign from heaven. These
   persons had probably heard of the recent miracle, as of many others
   wrought by Him; but, unwilling to accept the conclusion to which these
   wondrous works plainly led, they affected to regard them as
   insufficient evidence of His Messiahship, and demanded still more
   unequivocal proof before giving in their adherence to His claim. "Show
   us a sign from heaven," said they; meaning thereby, something like the
   manna brought down from heaven by Moses, or the fire called down by
   Elijah, or the thunder and rain called down by Samuel; [271] it being
   assumed that such signs could be wrought only by the power of God,
   whilst the signs on earth, such as Jesus supplied in His miracles of
   healing, might be wrought by the power of the devil! [272] It was a
   demand of a sort often addressed to Jesus in good faith or in bad;
   [273] for the Jews sought after such signs -- miracles of a singular
   and startling character, fitted to gratify a superstitious curiosity,
   and astonish a wonder-loving mind -- miracles that were merely signs,
   serving no other purpose than to display divine power; like the rod of
   Moses, converted into a serpent, and reconverted into its original
   form.

   These demands of the sign-seekers Jesus uniformly met with a direct
   refusal. He would not condescend to work miracles of any description
   merely as certificates of His own Messiahship, or to furnish food for a
   superstitious appetite, or materials of amusement to sceptics. He knew
   that such as remained unbelievers in presence of His ordinary miracles,
   which were not naked signs, but also works of beneficence, could not be
   brought to faith by any means; nay, that the more evidence they got,
   the more hardened they should become in unbelief. He regarded the very
   demand for these signs as the indication of a fixed determination on
   the part of those who made it not to believe in Him, even if, in order
   to rid themselves of the disagreeable obligation, it should be
   necessary to put Him to death. Therefore, in refusing the signs sought
   after, He was wont to accompany the refusal with a word of rebuke or of
   sad foreboding; as when He said, at a very early period of His
   ministry, on His first visit to Jerusalem, after His baptism: "Destroy
   this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." [274]

   On the present occasion the soul of Jesus was much perturbed by the
   renewed demands of the sign-seekers. "He sighed deeply in His spirit,"
   knowing full well what these demands meant, with respect both to those
   who made them and to Himself; and He addressed the parties who came
   tempting Him in excessively severe and bitter terms, -- reproaching
   them with spiritual blindness, calling them a wicked and adulterous
   generation, and ironically referring them now, as He had once done
   before, [275] to the sign of the prophet Jonas. He told them, that
   while they knew the weather signs, and understood what a red sky in the
   morning or evening meant, they were blind to the manifest signs of the
   times, which showed at once that the Sun of righteousness had arisen,
   and that a dreadful storm of judgment was coming like a dark night on
   apostate Israel for her iniquity. He applied to them, and the whole
   generation they represented, the epithet "wicked," to characterize
   their false-hearted, malevolent, and spiteful behavior towards Himself;
   and He employed the term "adulterous," to describe them, in relation to
   God, as guilty of breaking their marriage covenant, pretending great
   love and zeal with their lip, but in their heart and life turning away
   from the living God to idols -- forms, ceremonies, signs. He gave them
   the story of Jonah the prophet for a sign, in mystic allusion to His
   death; meaning to say, that one of the most reliable evidences that He
   was God's servant indeed, was just the fact that He was rejected, and
   ignominiously and barbarously treated by such as those to whom He
   spake: that there could be no worse sign of a man than to be well
   received by them -- that he could be no true Christ who was so
   received. [276]

   Having thus freely uttered His mind, Jesus left the sign-seekers; and
   entering into the ship in which He had just crossed from the other
   side, departed again to the same eastern shore, anxious to be rid of
   their unwelcome presence. On arriving at the land, He made the
   encounter which had just taken place the subject of instruction to the
   twelve. "Take heed," He said as they walked along the way, "and beware
   of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees." The word was spoken
   abruptly, as the utterance of one waking out of a revery. Jesus, we
   imagine, while His disciples rowed Him across the lake, had been
   brooding over what had occurred, sadly musing on prevailing unbelief,
   and the dark, lowering weather-signs, portentous of evil to Him and to
   the whole Jewish people. And now, recollecting the presence of the
   disciples, He communicates His thoughts to them in the form of a
   warning, and cautions them against the deadly influence of an evil
   time, as a parent might bid his child beware of a poisonous plant whose
   garish flowers attracted its eye.

   In this warning, it will be observed, pharisaic and sadducaic
   tendencies are identified. Jesus speaks not of two leavens, but of one
   common to both sects, as if they were two species of one genus, two
   branches from one stem. [277] And such indeed they were. Superficially,
   the two parties were very diverse. The one was excessively zealous, the
   other was "moderate" in religion; the one was strict, the other easy in
   morals; the one was exclusively and intensely Jewish in feeling, the
   other was open to the influence of pagan civilization. Each party had a
   leaven peculiar to itself: that of the Pharisees being, as Christ was
   wont to declare, hypocrisy; [278] that of the Sadducees, an engrossing
   interest in merely material and temporal concerns, assuming in some a
   political form, as in the case of the partisans of the Herod family,
   called in the Gospels Herodians, in others wearing the guise of a
   philosophy which denied the existence of spirit and the reality of the
   future life, and made that denial an excuse for exclusive devotion to
   the interests of time. But here, as elsewhere, extremes met.
   Phariseeism, Sadduceeism, Herodianism, though distinguished by minor
   differences, were radically one. The religionists, the philosophers,
   the politicians, were all members of one great party, which was
   inveterately hostile to the divine kingdom. All alike were
   worldly-minded (of the Pharisees it is expressly remarked that they
   were covetous [279] ); all were opposed to Christ for fundamentally the
   same reason, viz. because He was not of this world; all united
   fraternally at this time in the attempt to vex Him by unbelieving,
   unreasonable demands; [280] and they all had a hand in His death at the
   last. It was thus made apparent, once for all, that a Christian is not
   one who merely differs superficially either from Pharisees or from
   Sadducees separately, but one who differs radically from both. A
   weighty truth, not yet well understood; for it is fancied by many that
   right believing and right living consist in going to the opposite
   extreme from any tendency whose evil influence is apparent. To avoid
   pharisaic strictness and superstition, grown odious, men run into
   sadducaic scepticism and license; or, frightened by the excesses of
   infidelity and secularity, they seek salvation in ritualism, infallible
   churches, and the revival of medieval monkery. Thus the two tendencies
   continue ever propagating each other on the principle of action and
   reaction; one generation or school going all lengths in one direction,
   and another making a point of being as unlike its predecessor or its
   neighbor as possible, and both being equally far from the truth.

   What the common leaven of Phariseeism and Sadduceeism was, Jesus did
   not deem it necessary to state. He had already indicated its nature
   with sufficient plainness in His severe reply to the sign-seekers. The
   radical vice of both sects was just ungodliness: blindness, and
   deadness of heart to the Divine. They did not know the true and the
   good when they saw it; and when they knew it, they did not love it. All
   around them were the evidences that the King and the kingdom of grace
   were among them; yet here were they asking for arbitrary outward signs,
   "external evidences" in the worst sense, that He who spake as never man
   spake, and worked wonders of mercy such as had never before been
   witnessed, was no impostor, but a man wise and good, a prophet, and the
   Son of God. Verily the natural man, religious or irreligious, is blind
   and dead! What these seekers after a sign needed was not a new sign,
   but a new heart; not mere evidence, but a spirit willing to obey the
   truth.

   The spirit of unbelief which ruled in Jewish society Jesus described as
   a leaven, with special reference to its diffusiveness; and most fitly,
   for it passes from sire to son, from rich to poor, from learned to
   unlearned, till a whole generation has been vitiated by its malign
   influence. Such was the state of things in Israel as it came under His
   eye. Spiritual blindness and deadness, with the outward symptom of the
   inward malady, -- a constant craving for evidence, -- met him on every
   side. The common people, the leaders of society, the religious, the
   sceptics, the courtiers, and the rustics, were all blind, and yet
   apparently all most anxious to see; ever renewing the demand, "What
   sign showest Thou, that we may see and believe Thee? What dost Thou
   work?"

   Vexed an hour ago by the sinister movements of foes, Jesus next found
   new matter for annoyance in the stupidity of friends. The disciples
   utterly, even ludicrously, misunderstood the warning word addressed to
   them. In conversation by themselves, while their Master walked apart,
   they discussed the question, what the strange words, so abruptly and
   earnestly spoken, might mean; and they came to the sapient conclusion
   that they were intended to caution them against buying bread from
   parties belonging to either of the offensive sects. It was an absurd
   mistake, and yet, all things considered, it was not so very unnatural:
   for, in the first place, as already remarked, Jesus had introduced the
   subject very abruptly; and secondly, some time had elapsed since the
   meeting with the seekers of a sign, during which no allusion seems to
   have been made to that matter. How were they to know that during all
   that time their Master's thoughts had been occupied with what took
   place on the western shore of the lake? In any case, such a supposition
   was not likely to occur to their mind; for the demand for a sign had,
   doubtless, not appeared to them an event of much consequence, and it
   was probably forgotten as soon as their backs were turned upon the men
   who made it. And then, finally, it so happened that, just before Jesus
   began to speak, they remembered that in the hurry of a sudden departure
   they had forgotten to provide themselves with a stock of provisions for
   the journey. That was what they were thinking about when He began to
   say, "Take heed, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the
   Sadducees." The momentous circumstance that they had with them but one
   loaf was causing them so much concern, that when they heard the caution
   against a particular kind of leaven, they jumped at once to the
   conclusion, "It is because we have no bread."

   Yet the misunderstanding of the disciples, though simple and natural in
   its origin, was blameworthy. They could not have fallen into the
   mistake had the interest they took in spiritual and temporal things
   respectively been proportional to their relative importance. They had
   treated the incident on the other side of the lake too lightly, and
   they had treated their neglect to provide bread too gravely. They
   should have taken more to heart the ominous demand for a sign, and the
   solemn words spoken by their Master in reference thereto; and they
   should not have been troubled about the want of loaves in the company
   of Him who had twice miraculously fed the hungry multitude in the
   desert. Their thoughtlessness in one direction, and their
   over-thoughtfulness in another, showed that food and raiment occupied a
   larger place in their minds than the kingdom of God and its interests.
   Had they possessed more faith and more spirituality, they would not
   have exposed themselves to the reproachful question of their Master:
   "How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you
   concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
   and Sadducees?" [281]

   And yet, Jesus can hardly have expected these crude disciples to
   appreciate as He did the significance of what had occurred on the other
   side of the lake. It needed no common insight to discern the import of
   that demand for a sign; and the faculty of reading the signs of the
   times possessed by the disciples, as we shall soon see, and as all we
   have learned concerning them already might lead us to expect, was very
   small indeed. One of the principal lessons to be learned from the
   subject of this chapter, indeed, is just this: how different were the
   thoughts of Christ in reference to the future from the thoughts of His
   companions. We shall often have occasion to remark on this hereafter,
   as we advance towards the final crisis. At this point we are called to
   signalize the fact prominently for the first time.

   the Christ, if He gave the necessary miracle-sign, and to form a
   friendly alliance with Him. Jesus, on the other hand, he represents as
   unwilling to take the Messiah sceptre out of hands sin-stained, and
   preferring to reach by another path His throne. That He was not,

11. PETER'S CONFESSION; OR, CURRENT OPINION AND ETERNAL TRUTH

    Matt. 16:13-20; Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21.

   From the eastern shore of the lake Jesus directed His course northwards
   along the banks of the Upper Jordan, passing Bethsaida Julias, where,
   as Mark informs us, He restored eyesight to a blind man. Pursuing His
   journey, He arrived at length in the neighborhood of a town of some
   importance, beautifully situated near the springs of the Jordan, at the
   southern base of Mount Hermon. This was CÃ¦sarea Philippi, formerly
   called Paneas, from the heathen god Pan, who was worshipped by the
   Syrian Greeks in the limestone cavern near by, in which Jordan's
   fountains bubble forth to light. Its present name was given to it by
   Philip, tetrarch of Trachonitis, in honor of CÃ¦sar Augustus; his own
   name being appended (CÃ¦sarea Philippi, or Philip's CÃ¦sarea) to
   distinguish it from the other town of the same name on the
   Mediterranean coast. The town so named could boast of a temple of white
   marble, built by Herod the Great to the first Roman Emperor, besides
   villas and palaces, built by Philip, Herod's son, in whose territories
   it lay, and who, as we have just stated, gave it its new name.

   Away in that remote secluded region, Jesus occupied Himself for a
   season in secret prayer, and in confidential conversations with His
   disciples on topics of deepest interest. One of these conversations had
   reference to His own Person. He introduced the subject by asking the
   twelve the question, "Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am?" This
   question He asked, not as one needing to be informed, still less from
   any morbid sensitiveness, such as vain men feel respecting the opinions
   entertained of them by their fellow-creatures. He desired of His
   disciples a recital of current opinions, merely by way of preface to a
   profession of their own faith in the eternal truth concerning Himself.
   He deemed it good to draw forth from them such a profession at this
   time, because He was about to make communications to them on another
   subject, viz. His sufferings, which He knew would sorely try their
   faith. He wished them to be fairly committed to the doctrine of His
   Messiah-ship before proceeding to speak in plain terms on the unwelcome
   theme of His death.

   From the reply of the disciples, it appears that their Master had been
   the subject of much talk among the people. This is only what we should
   have expected. Jesus was a very public and a very extraordinary person,
   and to be much talked about is one of the inevitable penalties of
   prominence. The merits and the claims of the Son of man were
   accordingly freely and widely canvassed in those days, with gravity or
   with levity, with prejudice or with candor, with decision or
   indecision, intelligently or ignorantly, as is the way of men in all
   ages. As they mingled with the people, it was the lot of the twelve to
   hear many opinions concerning their Lord which never reached His ear;
   sometimes kind and favorable, making them glad; at other times unkind
   and unfavorable, making them sad.

   The opinions prevalent among the masses concerning Jesus -- for it was
   with reference to these that He interrogated His disciples [282] --
   seem to have been mainly favorable. All agreed in regarding Him as a
   prophet of the highest rank, differing only as to which of the great
   prophets of Israel He most nearly resembled or personated. Some said He
   was John the Baptist revived, others Elias, while others again
   identified Him with one or other of the great prophets, as Jeremiah.
   These opinions are explained in part by an expectation then commonly
   entertained, that the advent of the Messiah would be preceded by the
   return of one of the prophets by whom God had spoken to the fathers,
   partly by the perception of real or supposed resemblances between Jesus
   and this or that prophet; His tenderness reminding one hearer of the
   author of the Lamentations, His sternness in denouncing hypocrisy and
   tyranny reminding another of the prophet of fire, while perhaps His
   parabolic discourses led a third to think of Ezekiel or of Daniel.

   When we reflect on the high veneration in which the ancient prophets
   were held, we cannot fail to see that these diverse opinions current
   among the Jewish people concerning Jesus imply a very high sense of His
   greatness and excellence. To us, who regard Him as the Sun, while the
   prophets were at best but lamps of greater or less brightness, such
   comparisons may well seem not only inadequate, but dishonoring. Yet we
   must not despise them, as the testimonies of open-minded but
   imperfectly-formed contemporaries to the worth of Him whom we worship
   as the Lord. Taken separately, they show that in the judgment of candid
   observers Jesus was a man of surpassing greatness; taken together, they
   show the many-sidedness of His character, and its superiority to that
   of any one of the prophets; for He could not have reminded those who
   witnessed His works, and heard Him preach, of all the prophets in turn,
   unless He had comprehended them all in His one person. The very
   diversity of opinion respecting Him, therefore, showed that a greater
   than Elias, or Jeremiah, or Ezekiel, or Daniel, had appeared.

   These opinions, valuable still as testimonials to the excellence of
   Christ, must be admitted further to be indicative, so far, of good
   dispositions on the part of those who cherished and expressed them. At
   a time when those who deemed themselves in every respect immeasurably
   superior to the multitude could find no better names for the Son of man
   than Samaritan, devil, blasphemer, glutton and drunkard, companion of
   publicans and sinners, it was something considerable to believe that
   the calumniated One was a prophet as worthy of honor as any of those
   whose sepulchres the professors of piety carefully varnished, while
   depreciating, and even putting to death, their living successors. The
   multitude who held this opinion might come short of true discipleship;
   but they were at least far in advance of the Pharisees and Sadducees,
   who came in tempting mood to ask a sign from heaven, and whom no sign,
   whether in heaven or in earth, would conciliate or convince.

   How, then, did Jesus receive the report of His disciples? Was He
   satisfied with these favorable, and in the circumstances really
   gratifying, opinions current among the people? He was not. He was not
   content to be put on a level with even the greatest of the prophets. He
   did not indeed express any displeasure against those who assigned Him
   such a rank, and He may even have been pleased to hear that public
   opinion had advanced so far on the way to the true faith. Nevertheless
   He declined to accept the position accorded. The meek and lowly Son of
   man claimed to be something more than a great prophet. Therefore He
   turned to His chosen disciples, as to men from whom He expected a more
   satisfactory statement of the truth, and pointedly asked what they
   thought of Him. "But you -- whom say ye that I am?"

   In this case, as in many others, Simon son of Jonas answered for the
   company. His prompt, definite, memorable reply to his Master's question
   was this: "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." [283]

   With this view of His person Jesus was satisfied. He did not charge
   Peter with extravagance in going so far beyond the opinion of the
   populace. On the contrary, He entirely approved of what the ardent
   disciple had said, and expressed His satisfaction in no cold or
   measured terms. Never, perhaps, did He speak in more animated language,
   or with greater appearance of deep emotion. He solemnly pronounced
   Peter "blessed" on account of His faith; He spake for the first time of
   a church which should be founded, professing Peter's faith as its
   creed; He promised that disciple great power in that church, as if
   grateful to him for being the first to put the momentous truth into
   words, and for uttering it so boldly amid prevailing unbelief, and
   crude, defective belief; and He expressed, in the strongest possible
   terms, His confidence that the church yet to be founded would stand to
   all ages proof against all the assaults of the powers of darkness.

   Simon's confession, fairly interpreted, seems to contain these two
   propositions, -- that Jesus was the Messiah, and that He was divine.
   "Thou art the Christ," said he in the first place, with conscious
   reference to the reported opinions of the people, -- "Thou art the
   Christ," and not merely a prophet come to prepare Christ's way. Then he
   added: "the Son of God," to explain what he understood by the term
   Christ. The Messiah looked for by the Jews in general was merely a man,
   though a very superior one, the ideal man endowed with extraordinary
   gifts. The Christ of Peter's creed was more than man -- a superhuman, a
   divine being. This truth he sought to express in the second part of his
   confession. He called Jesus Son of God, with obvious reference to the
   name His Master had just given Himself -- Son of man. "Thou," he meant
   to say, "art not only what Thou hast now called Thyself, and what, in
   lowliness of mind, Thou art wont to call Thyself -- the Son of man;
   [284] Thou art also Son of God, partaking of the divine nature not less
   really than of the human." Finally, he prefixed the epithet "living" to
   the divine name, to express his consciousness that he was making a very
   momentous declaration, and to give that declaration a solemn,
   deliberate character. It was as if he said: "I know it is no light
   matter to call any one, even Thee, Son of God, of the One living
   eternal Jehovah. But I shrink not from the assertion, however bold,
   startling, or even blasphemous it may seem. I cannot by any other
   expression do justice to all I know and feel concerning Thee, or convey
   the impression left on my mind by what I have witnessed during the time
   I have followed Thee as a disciple." In this way was the disciple urged
   on, in spite of his Jewish monotheism, to the recognition of his Lord's
   divinity. [285]

   That the famous confession, uttered in the neighborhood of CÃ¦sarea
   Philippi, really contains in germ [286] the doctrine of Christ's
   divinity, might be inferred from the simple fact that Jesus was
   satisfied with it; for He certainly claimed to be Son of God in a sense
   predicable of no mere man, even according to synoptical accounts of His
   teaching. [287] But when we consider the peculiar terms in which He
   expressed Himself respecting Peter's faith, we are still further
   confirmed in this conclusion. "Flesh and blood," said He to the
   disciple, "hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in
   heaven." These words evidently imply that the person addressed had said
   something very extraordinary; something he could not have learned from
   the traditional established belief of his generation respecting
   Messiah; something new even for himself and his fellow-disciples, if
   not in word, at least in meaning, [288] to which he could not have
   attained by the unaided effort of his own mind. The confession is
   virtually represented as an inspiration, a revelation, a flash of light
   from heaven, -- the utterance not of the rude fisherman, but of the
   divine Spirit speaking, through his mouth, a truth hitherto hidden, and
   yet but dimly comprehended by him to whom it hath been revealed. All
   this agrees well with the supposition that the confession contains not
   merely an acknowledgment of the Messiahship of Jesus in the ordinary
   sense, but a proclamation of the true doctrine concerning Messiah's
   person -- viz. that He was a divine being manifest in the flesh.

   The remaining portion of our Lord's address to Simon shows that He
   assigned to the doctrine confessed by that disciple the place of
   fundamental importance in the Christian faith. The object of these
   remarkable statements [289] is not to assert the supremacy of Peter, as
   Romanists contend, but to declare the supremely important nature of the
   truth he has confessed. In spite of all difficulties of interpretation,
   this remains clear and certain to us. Who or what the "rock" is we deem
   doubtful; it may be Peter, or it may be his confession: it is a point
   on which scholars equally sound in the faith, and equally innocent of
   all sympathy with Popish dogmas, are divided in opinion, and on which
   it would ill become us to dogmatize. Of this only we are sure, that not
   Peter's person, but Peter's faith, is the fundamental matter in
   Christ's mind. When He says to that disciple, "Thou art Petros," He
   means, "Thou art a man of rock, worthy of the name I gave thee by
   anticipation the first time I met thee, because thou hast at length got
   thy foot planted on the rock of the eternal truth." He speaks of the
   church that is to be, for the first time, in connection with Simon's
   confession, because that church is to consist of men adopting that
   confession as their own, and acknowledging Him to be the Christ, the
   Son of God. [290] He alludes to the keys of the kingdom of heaven in
   the same connection, because none but those who homologate the doctrine
   first solemnly enunciated by Simon, shall be admitted within its gates.
   He promises Peter the power of the keys, not because it is to belong to
   him alone, or to him more than others, but by way of honorable mention,
   in recompense for the joy he has given his Lord by the superior energy
   and decision of his faith. He is grateful to Peter, because he has
   believed most emphatically that He came out from God; [291] and He
   shows His gratitude by promising first to him individually a power
   which He afterwards conferred on all His chosen disciples. [292] ]
   Finally, if it be true that Peter is here called the rock on which the
   church shall be built, this is to be understood in the same way as the
   promise of the keys. Peter is called the foundation of the church only
   in the same sense as all the apostles are called the foundation by the
   Apostle Paul, [293] viz. as the first preachers of the true faith
   concerning Jesus as the Christ and Son of God; and if the man who first
   professed that faith be honored by being called individually the rock,
   that only shows that the faith, and not the man, is after all the true
   foundation. That which makes Simon a Petros, a rock-like man, fit to
   build on, is the real Petra on which the Ecclesia is to be built.

   After these remarks we deem it superfluous to enter minutely into the
   question to what the term "rock" refers in the sentence, "Thou art
   Peter, and on this rock I will build my church." At the same time, we
   must say that it is by no means so clear to us that the rock must be
   Peter, and can be nothing else, as it is the fashion of modern
   commentators to assert. To the rendering, "Thou art Petros, a man of
   rock; and on thee, as on a rock, I will build my church," it is
   possible, as already admitted, to assign an intelligible scriptural
   meaning. But we confess our preference for the old Protestant
   interpretation, according to which our Lord's words to His disciple
   should be thus paraphrased: "Thou, Simon Barjonas, art Petros, a man of
   rock, worthy of thy name Peter, because thou hast made that bold, good
   confession; and on the truth thou hast now confessed, as on a rock,
   will I build my church; and so long as it abides on that foundation it
   will stand firm and unassailable against all the powers of hell." So
   rendering, we make Jesus say not only what He really thought, but what
   was most worthy to be said. For divine truth is the sure foundation.
   Believers, even Peters, may fail, and prove any thing but stable; but
   truth is eternal, and faileth never. This we say not unmindful of the
   counterpart truth, that "the truth," unless confessed by living souls,
   is dead, and no source of stability. Sincere personal conviction, with
   a life corresponding, is needed to make the faith in the objective
   sense of any virtue.

   We cannot pass from these memorable words of Christ without adverting,
   with a certain solemn awe, to the strange fate which has befallen them
   in the history of the church. This text, in which the church's Lord
   declares that the powers of darkness shall not prevail against her, has
   been used by these powers as an instrument of assault, and with only
   too much success. What a gigantic system of spiritual despotism and
   blasphemous assumption has been built on these two sentences concerning
   the rock and the keys! How nearly, by their aid, has the kingdom of God
   been turned into a kingdom of Satan! One is tempted to wish that Jesus,
   knowing beforehand what was to happen, had so framed His words as to
   obviate the mischief. But the wish were vain. No forms of expression,
   however carefully selected, could prevent human ignorance from falling
   into misconception, or hinder men who had a purpose to serve, from
   finding in Scripture what suited that purpose. Nor can any Christian,
   on reflection, think it desirable that the Author of our faith had
   adopted a studied prudential style of speech, intended not so much to
   give faithful expression to the actual thoughts of His mind and
   feelings of His heart, as to avoid giving occasion of stumbling to
   honest stupidity, or an excuse for perversion to dishonest knavery. The
   spoken word in that case had been no longer a true reflection of the
   Word incarnate. All the poetry and passion and genuine human feeling
   which form the charm of Christ's sayings would have been lost, and
   nothing would have remained but prosaic platitudes, like those of the
   scribes and of theological pedants. No; let us have the precious words
   of our Master in all their characteristic intensity and vehemence of
   unqualified assertion; and if prosaic or disingenuous men will
   manufacture out of them incredible dogmas, let them answer for it. Why
   should the children be deprived of their bread, and only the dogs be
   cared for?

   One remark more ere we pass from the subject of this chapter. The part
   we find Peter playing in this incident at CÃ¦sarea Philippi prepares us
   for regarding as historically credible the part assigned to him in the
   Acts of the Apostles in some momentous scenes, as, e.g., in that
   brought before us in the tenth chapter. The TÃ¼bingen school of critics
   tell us that the Acts is a composition full of invented situations
   adapted to an apologetic design; and that the plan on which the book
   proceeds is to make Peter act as like Paul as possible in the first
   part, and Paul, on the other hand, as much like Peter as possible in
   the second. The conversion of the Roman centurion by Peter's agency
   they regard as a capital instance of Peter being made to pose as Paul,
   i.e., as an universalist in his views of Christianity. Now, all we have
   to say on the subject here is this. The conduct ascribed to Peter the
   apostle in the tenth chapter of the Acts is credible in the light of
   the narrative we have been studying. In both we find the same man the
   recipient of a revelation; in both we find him the first to receive,
   utter, and act on a great Christian truth. Is it incredible that the
   man who received one revelation as a disciple should receive another as
   an apostle? Is it not psychologically probable that the man who now
   appears so original and audacious in connection with one great truth,
   will again show the same attributes of originality and audacity in
   connection with some other truth? For our part, far from feeling
   sceptical as to the historic truth of the narrative in the Acts, we
   should have been very much surprised if in the history of the nascent
   church Peter had been found playing a part altogether devoid of
   originalities and audacities. He would in that case have been very
   unlike his former self.

12. FIRST LESSON ON THE CROSS
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT OF CHRIST'S DEATH

    Matt. 16:21-28; Mark 8:31-38; Luke 9:22-27.

   Not till an advanced period in His public ministry -- not, in fact,
   till it was drawing to a close -- did Jesus speak in plain,
   unmistakable terms of His death. The solemn event was foreknown by Him
   from the first; and He betrayed His consciousness of what was awaiting
   Him by a variety of occasional allusions. These earlier utterances,
   however, were all couched in mystic language. They were of the nature
   of riddles, whose meaning became clear after the event, but which
   before, none could, or at least did, read. Jesus spake now of a temple,
   which, if destroyed, He should raise again in three days; [294] at
   another time of a lifting up of the Son of man, like unto that of the
   brazen serpent in the wilderness; [295] and on yet other occasions, of
   a sad separation of the bridegroom from the children of the
   bridechamber, [296] of the giving of His flesh for the life of the
   world, [297] and of a sign like that of the prophet Jonas, which should
   be given in His own person to an evil and adulterous generation. [298]

   At length, after the conversation in CÃ¦sarea Philippi, Jesus changed
   His style of speaking on the subject of His sufferings, substituting
   for dark, hidden allusions, plain, literal, matter-of-fact statements.
   [299] This change was naturally adapted to the altered circumstances in
   which He was placed. The signs of the times were growing ominous;
   storm-clouds were gathering in the air; all things were beginning to
   point towards Calvary. His work in Galilee and the provinces was nearly
   done; it remained for Him to bear witness to the truth in and around
   the holy city; and from the present mood of the ecclesiastical
   authorities and the leaders of religious society, as manifested by
   captious question and unreasonable demand, [300] and a constant
   espionage on His movements, it was not difficult to foresee that it
   would not require many more offences, or much longer time, to ripen
   dislike and jealousy into murderous hatred. Such plain speaking,
   therefore, concerning what was soon to happen, was natural and
   seasonable. Jesus was now entering the valley of the shadow of death,
   and in so speaking He was but adapting His talk to the situation.

   Plain-speaking regarding His death was now not only natural on Christ's
   part, but at once necessary and safe in reference to his disciples. It
   was necessary, in order that they might be prepared for the approaching
   event, as far as that was possible in the case of men who, to the last,
   persisted in hoping that the issue would be different from what their
   Master anticipated. It was safe; for now the subject might be spoken of
   plainly without serious risk to their faith. Before the disciples were
   established in the doctrine of Christ's person, the doctrine of the
   cross might have scared them away altogether. Premature preaching of a
   Christ to be crucified might have made them unbelievers in the
   fundamental truth that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ. Therefore, in
   consideration of their weakness, Jesus maintained a certain reserve
   respecting His sufferings, till their faith in Him as the Christ should
   have become sufficiently rooted to stand the strain of the storm soon
   to be raised by a most unexpected, unwelcome, and incomprehensible
   announcement. Only after hearing Peter's confession was He satisfied
   that the strength necessary for enduring the trial had been attained.

   Wherefore, "from that time forth began Jesus to show unto His disciples
   how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the
   elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised
   again the third day."

   Every clause in this solemn announcement demands our reverent scrutiny.

   Jesus showed unto His disciples --

   I. "That He must go unto Jerusalem." Yes! there the tragedy must be
   enacted: that was the fitting scene for the stupendous events that were
   about to take place. It was dramatically proper that the Son of man
   should die in that "holy," unholy city, which had earned a most
   unenviable notoriety as the murderess of the prophets, the stoner of
   them whom God sent unto her. "It cannot be" -- it were incongruous --
   "that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem." [301] It was due also to the
   dignity of Jesus, and to the design of His death, that He should suffer
   there. Not in an obscure corner or in an obscure way must He die, but
   in the most public place, and in a formal, judicial manner. He must be
   lifted up in view of the whole Jewish nation, so that all might see Him
   whom they had pierced, and by whose stripes also they might yet be
   healed. The "Lamb of God" must be slain in the place where all the
   legal sacrifices were offered.

   2. "And suffer many things." Too many to enumerate, too painful to
   speak of in detail, and better passed over in silence for the present.
   The bare fact that their beloved Master was to be put to death, without
   any accompanying indignities, would be sufficiently dreadful to the
   disciples; and Jesus mercifully drew a veil over much that was present
   to His own thoughts. In a subsequent conversation on the same sad
   theme, when His passion was near at hand, He drew aside the veil a
   little, and showed them some of the "many things." But even then He was
   very sparing in His allusions, hinting only by a passing word that He
   should be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon. [302] He took no delight
   in expatiating on such harrowing scenes. He was willing to bear those
   indignities, but He cared not to speak of them more than was absolutely
   necessary.

   3. "Of the elders and chief priests and scribes." Not of them alone,
   for Gentile rulers and the people of Israel were to have a hand in
   evil-entreating the Son of man as well as Jewish ecclesiastics. But the
   parties named were to be the prime movers and most guilty agents in the
   nefarious transaction. The men who ought to have taught the people to
   recognize in Jesus the Lord's Anointed, would hound them on to cry,
   "Crucify Him, crucify Him," and by importunities and threats urge
   heathen authorities to perpetrate a crime for which they had no heart.
   Gray-haired elders sitting in council would solemnly decide that He was
   worthy of death; high priests would utter oracles, that one man must
   die for the people, that the whole nation perish not; scribes learned
   in the law would use their legal knowledge to invent plausible grounds
   for an accusation involving capital punishment. Jesus had suffered many
   petty annoyances from such persons already; but the time was
   approaching when nothing would satisfy them but getting the object of
   their dislike cast forth out of the world. Alas for Israel, when her
   wise men, and her holy men, and her learned men, knew of no better use
   to make of the stone chosen of God, and precious, than thus
   contemptuously and wantonly to fling it away!

   4. "And be killed." Yes, and for blessed ends pre-ordained of God. But
   of these Jesus speaks not now. He simply states, in general terms, the
   fact, in this first lesson on the doctrine of the cross. [303] Any
   thing more at this stage had been wasted words. To what purpose speak
   of the theology of the cross, of God's great design in the death which
   was to be brought about by man's guilty instrumentality, to disciples
   unwilling to receive even the matter of fact? The rude shock of an
   unwelcome announcement must first be over before any thing can be
   profitably said on these higher themes. Therefore not a syllable here
   of salvation by the death of the Son of man; of Christ crucified for
   man's guilt as well as by man's guilt. The hard bare fact alone is
   stated, theology being reserved for another season, when the hearers
   should be in a fitter frame of mind for receiving instruction.

   5. Finally, Jesus told His disciples that He should "be raised again
   the third day." To some so explicit a reference to the resurrection at
   this early date has appeared improbable. [304] To us, on the contrary,
   it appears eminently seasonable. When was Jesus more likely to tell His
   disciples that He would rise again shortly after His death, than just
   on the occasion when He first told them plainly that He should die? He
   knew how harsh the one announcement would be to the feelings of His
   faithful ones, and it was natural that He should add the other, in the
   hope that when it was understood that His death was to be succeeded,
   after a brief interval of three days, by resurrection, the news would
   be much less hard to bear. Accordingly, after uttering the dismal words
   "be killed," He, with characteristic tenderness, hastened to say, "and
   be raised again the third day;." that, having torn, He might heal, and
   having smitten, He might bind up. [305]

   The grave communications made by Jesus were far from welcome to His
   disciples. Neither now nor at any subsequent time did they listen to
   the forebodings of their Lord with resignation even, not to speak of
   cheerful acquiescence or spiritual joy. They never heard Him speak of
   His death without pain; and their only comfort, in connection with such
   announcements as the present, seems to have been the hope that He had
   taken too gloomy a view of the situation, and that His apprehensions
   would turn out groundless. They, for their part, could see no grounds
   for such dark anticipations, and their Messianic ideas did not dispose
   them to be on the outlook for these. They had not the slightest
   conception that it behoved the Christ to suffer. On the contrary, a
   crucified Christ was a scandal and a contradiction to them, quite as
   much as it continued to be to the majority of the Jewish people after
   the Lord had ascended to glory. Hence the more firmly they believed
   that Jesus was the Christ, the more confounding it was to be told that
   He must be put to death. "How," they asked themselves, "can these
   things be? How can the Son of God be subject to such indignities? How
   can our Master be the Christ, as we firmly believe, come to set up the
   divine kingdom, and to be crowned its King with glory and honor, and
   yet at the same time be doomed to undergo the ignominious fate of a
   criminal execution?" These questions the twelve could not now, nor
   until after the Resurrection, answer; nor is this wonderful, for if
   flesh and blood could not reveal the doctrine of Christ's person, still
   less could it reveal the doctrine of His cross. Not without a very
   special illumination from heaven could they understand the merest
   elements of that doctrine, and see, e.g., that nothing was more worthy
   of the Son of God than to humble Himself and become subject unto death,
   even the death of the cross; that the glory of God consists not merely
   in being the highest, but in this, that being high, He stoops in lowly
   love to bear the burden of His own sinful creatures; that nothing could
   more directly and certainly conduce to the establishment of the divine
   kingdom than the gracious self-humiliation of the King; that only by
   ascending the cross could Messiah ascend the throne of His mediatorial
   glory; that only so could He subdue human hearts, and become Lord of
   men's affections as well as of their destinies. Many in the church do
   not understand these blessed truths, even at this late era: what
   wonder, then, if they were hid for a season from the eyes of the first
   disciples! Let us not reproach them for the veil that was on their
   faces; let us rather make sure that the same veil is not on our own.

   On this occasion, as at CÃ¦sarea Philippi, the twelve found a most
   eloquent and energetic interpreter of their sentiments in Simon Peter.
   The action and speech of that disciple at this time were characteristic
   in the highest degree. He took Jesus, we are told (laid hold of Him, we
   suppose, by His hand or His garment), and began to rebuke Him, saying,
   "Be it far from Thee, Lord;." or more literally, "God be merciful to
   Thee: God forbid! this shall not be unto Thee." What a strange compound
   of good and evil is this man! His language is dictated by the most
   intense affection: he cannot bear the thought of any harm befalling his
   Lord; yet how irreverent and disrespectful he is towards Him whom he
   has just acknowledged to be the Christ, the Son of the living God! How
   he overbears, and contradicts, and domineers, and, as it were, tries to
   bully his Master into putting away from His thoughts those gloomy
   forebodings of coming evil! Verily he has need of chastisement to teach
   him his own place, and to scourge out of his character the bad elements
   of forwardness, and undue familiarity, and presumptuous self-will.

   Happily for Peter, he had a Master who, in His faithful love, spared
   not the rod when it was needful. Jesus judged that it was needed now,
   and therefore He administered a rebuke not less remarkable for severity
   than was the encomium at CÃ¦sarea Philippi for warm, unqualified
   approbation, and curiously contrasting with that encomium in the terms
   in which it was expressed. He turned round on His offending disciple,
   and sternly said: "Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence unto
   me: for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be
   of men." The same disciple who on the former occasion had spoken by
   inspiration of Heaven is here represented as speaking by inspiration of
   mere flesh and blood -- of mere natural affection for his Lord, and of
   the animal instinct of self-preservation, thinking of self-interest
   merely, not of duty. He whom Christ had pronounced a man of rock,
   strong in faith, and fit to be a foundation-stone in the spiritual
   edifice, is here called an offence, a stumbling-stone lying in his
   Master's path. Peter, the noble confessor of that fundamental truth, by
   the faith of which the church would be able to defy the gates of hell,
   appears here in league with the powers of darkness, the unconscious
   mouth-piece of Satan the tempter. "Get thee behind me, Satan!" What a
   downcome for him who but yesterday got that promise of the power of the
   keys! How suddenly has the novice church dignitary, too probably lifted
   up with pride or vanity, fallen into the condemnation of the devil!

   This memorable rebuke seems mercilessly severe, and yet on
   consideration we feel it was nothing more than what was called for.
   Christ's language on this occasion needs no apology, such as might be
   drawn from supposed excitement of feeling, or from a consciousness on
   the speaker's part that the infirmity of His own sentient nature was
   whispering the same suggestion as that which came from Peter's lips.
   Even the hard word Satan, which is the sting of the speech, is in its
   proper place. It describes exactly the character of the advice given by
   Simon. That advice was substantially this: "Save thyself at any rate;
   sacrifice duty to self-interest, the cause of God to personal
   convenience." An advice truly Satanic in principle and tendency! For
   the whole aim of Satanic policy is to get self-interest recognized as
   the chief end of man. Satan's temptations aim at nothing worse than
   this. Satan is called the Prince of this world, because self-interest
   rules the world; he is called the accuser of the brethren, because he
   does not believe that even the sons of God have any higher motive. He
   is a sceptic; and his scepticism consists in determined, scornful
   unbelief in the reality of any chief end other than that of personal
   advantage. "Doth Job, or even Jesus, serve God for naught?
   Self-sacrifice, suffering for righteousness' sake, fidelity to truth
   even unto death: -- it is all romance and youthful sentimentalism, or
   hypocrisy and hollow cant. There is absolutely no such thing as a
   surrender of the lower life for the higher; all men are selfish at
   heart, and have their price: some may hold out longer than others, but
   in the last extremity every man will prefer his own things to the
   things of God. All that a man hath will he give for his life, his moral
   integrity and his piety not excepted." Such is Satan's creed.

   The suggestion made by Peter, as the unconscious tool of the spirit of
   evil, is identical in principle with that made by Satan himself to
   Jesus in the temptation in the wilderness. The tempter said then in
   effect: "If Thou be the Son of God, use Thy power for Thine own behoof;
   Thou art hungry, e.g., make bread for Thyself out of the stones. If
   Thou be the Son of God, presume on Thy privilege as the favorite of
   Heaven; cast Thyself down from this elevation, securely counting on
   protection from harm, even where other men would be allowed to suffer
   the consequences of their foolhardiness. What better use canst Thou
   make of Thy divine powers and privileges than to promote Thine own
   advantage and glory?" Peter's feeling at the present time seems to have
   been much the same: "If Thou be the Son of God, why shouldst Thou
   suffer an ignominious, violent death? Thou hast power to save Thyself
   from such a fate; surely Thou wilt not hesitate to use it!" The
   attached disciple, in fact, was an unconscious instrument employed by
   Satan to subject Jesus to a second temptation, analogous to the earlier
   one in the desert of Judea. It was the god of this world that was at
   work in both cases; who, being accustomed to find men only too ready to
   prefer safety to righteousness, could not believe that he should find
   nothing of this spirit in the Son of God, and therefore came again and
   again seeking an open point in His armor through which he might shoot
   his fiery darts; not renouncing hope till his intended victim hung on
   the cross, apparently conquered by the world, but in reality a
   conqueror both of the world and of its lord.

   The severe language uttered by Jesus on this occasion, when regarded as
   addressed to a dearly beloved disciple, shows in a striking manner His
   holy abhorrence of every thing savoring of self-seeking. "Save
   Thyself," counsels Simon: "Get thee behind me, Satan," replies Simon's
   Lord. Truly Christ was not one who pleased Himself. Though He were a
   Son, yet would He learn obedience by the things which He had to suffer.
   And by this mind He proved Himself to be the Son, and won from His
   Father the approving voice: "Thou art my beloved Son, in Thee I am well
   pleased," -- Heaven's reply to the voice from hell counselling Him to
   pursue a course of self-pleasing. Persevering in this mind, Jesus was
   at length lifted up on the cross, and so became the Author of eternal
   salvation unto all them that obey Him. Blessed now and forevermore be
   His name, who so humbled Himself, and became obedient as far as death!

  SECTION II. CROSS-BEARING, THE LAW OF DISCIPLESHIP

    Matt. xvi. 24-28; Mark viii. 34-38; Luke ix. 23-27.

   After one hard announcement, comes another not less hard. The Lord
   Jesus has told His disciples that He must one day be put to death; He
   now tells them, that as it fares with Him, so it must fare with them
   also. The second announcement was naturally occasioned by the way in
   which the first had been received. Peter had said, and all had felt,
   "This shall not be unto Thee." Jesus replies in effect, "Say you so? I
   tell you that not only shall I, your Master, be crucified, -- for such
   will be the manner of my death, [306] -- but ye too, faithfully
   following me, shall most certainly have your crosses to bear. If any
   man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross,
   and follow me.' "

   The second announcement was not, like the first, made to the twelve
   only. This we might infer from the terms of the announcement, which are
   general, even if we had not been informed, as we are by Mark and Luke,
   that before making it Jesus called the people unto Him, with His
   disciples, and spake in the hearing of them all. [307] The doctrine
   here taught, therefore, is for all Christians in all ages: not for
   apostles only, but for the humblest disciples; not for priests or
   preachers, but for the laity as well; not for monks living in
   cloisters, but for men living and working in the outside world. The
   King and Head of the church here proclaims a universal law binding on
   all His subjects, requiring all to bear a cross in fellowship with
   Himself.

   We are not told how the second announcement was received by those who
   heard it, and particularly by the twelve. We can believe, however, that
   to Peter and his brethren it sounded less harsh than the first, and
   seemed, at least theoretically, more acceptable. Common experience
   might teach them that crosses, however unpleasant to flesh and blood,
   were nevertheless things that might be looked for in the lot of mere
   men. But what had Christ the Son of God to do with crosses? Ought He
   not to be exempt from the sufferings and indignities of ordinary
   mortals? If not, of what avail was His divine Sonship? In short, the
   difficulty for the twelve was probably, not that the servant should be
   no better than the Master, but that the Master should be no better than
   the servant.

   Our perplexity, on the other hand, is apt to be just the reverse of
   this. Familiar with the doctrine that Jesus died on the cross in our
   room, we are apt to wonder what occasion there can be for our bearing a
   cross. If He suffered for us vicariously, what need, we are ready to
   inquire, for suffering on our part likewise? We need to be reminded
   that Christ's sufferings, while in some respects peculiar, are in other
   respects common to Him with all in whom His spirit abides; that while,
   as redemptive, His death stands alone, as suffering for righteousness'
   sake it is but the highest instance of a universal law, according to
   which all who live a true godly life must suffer hardship in a false
   evil world. [308] And it is very observable that Jesus took a most
   effectual method of keeping this truth prominently before the mind of
   His followers in all ages, by proclaiming it with great emphasis on the
   first occasion on which He plainly announced that He Himself was to
   die, giving it, in fact, as the first lesson on the doctrine of His
   death: the first of four to be found in the Gospels. [309] Thereby He
   in effect declared that only such as were willing to be crucified with
   Him should be saved by His death; nay, that willingness to bear a cross
   was indispensable to the right understanding of the doctrine of
   salvation through Him. It is as if above the door of the school in
   which the mystery of redemption was to be taught, He had inscribed the
   legend: Let no man who is unwilling to deny himself, and take up his
   cross, enter here.

   In this great law of discipleship the cross signifies not merely the
   external penalty of death, but all troubles that come on those who
   earnestly endeavor to live as Jesus lived in this world, and in
   consequence of that endeavor. Many and various are the afflictions of
   the righteous, differing in kind and degree, according to times and
   circumstances, and the callings and stations of individuals. For the
   righteous One, who died not only by the unjust, but for them, the
   appointed cup was filled with all possible ingredients of shame and
   pain, mingled together in the highest degree of bitterness. Not a few
   of His most honored servants have come very near their Master in the
   manner and measure of their afflictions for His sake, and have indeed
   drunk of His cup, and been baptized with His bloody baptism. But for
   the rank and file of the Christian host the hardships to be endured are
   ordinarily less severe, the cross to be borne less heavy. For one the
   cross may be the calumnies of lying lips, "which speak grievous things
   proudly and contemptuously against the righteous;." for another,
   failure to attain the much-worshipped idol success in life, so often
   reached by unholy means not available for a man who has a conscience;
   for a third, mere isolation and solitariness of spirit amid
   uncongenial, unsympathetic neighbors, not minded to live soberly,
   righteously, and godly, and not loving those who do so live.

   The cross, therefore, is not the same for all. But that there is a
   cross of some shape for all true disciples is clearly implied in the
   words: "If any one will come after me, let him deny himself, and take
   up his cross." The plain meaning of these words is, that there is no
   following Jesus on any other terms -- a doctrine which, however clearly
   taught in the Gospel, spurious Christians are unwilling to believe and
   resolute to deny. They take the edge off their Lord's statement by
   explaining that it applies only to certain critical times, happily very
   different from their own; or that if it has some reference to all
   times, it is only applicable to such as are called to play a prominent
   part in public affairs as leaders of opinion, pioneers of progress,
   prophets denouncing the vices of the age, and uttering unwelcome
   oracles, -- a proverbially dangerous occupation, as the Greek poet
   testified who said: "Apollo alone should prophesy, for he fears
   nobody." [310] To maintain that all who would live devoutly in Christ
   Jesus must suffer somehow, is, they think, to take too gloomy and
   morose a view of the wickedness of the world, or too high and exacting
   a view of the Christian life. The righteousness which in ordinary times
   involves a cross is in their view folly and fanaticism. It is speaking
   when one should be silent, meddling in matters with which one has no
   concern; in a word, it is being righteous overmuch. Such thoughts as
   these, expressed or unexpressed, are sure to prevail extensively when
   religious profession is common. The fact that fidelity involves a
   cross, as also the fact that Christ was crucified just because He was
   righteous, are well understood by Christians when they are a suffering
   minority, as in primitive ages. But these truths are much lost sight of
   in peaceful, prosperous times. Then you shall find many holding most
   sound views of the cross Christ bore for them, but sadly ignorant
   concerning the cross they themselves have to bear in fellowship with
   Christ. Of this cross they are determined to know nothing. What it can
   mean, or whence it can come, they cannot comprehend; though had they
   the true spirit of self-denial required of disciples by Christ, they
   might find it for themselves in their daily life, in their business, in
   their home, nay, in their own heart, and have no need to seek for it in
   the ends of the earth, or to manufacture artificial crosses out of
   ascetic austerities.

   To the law of the cross Jesus annexed three reasons designed to make
   the obeying of it easier, by showing disciples that, in rendering
   obedience to the stern requirement, they attend to their own true
   interest. Each reason is introduced by a "For."

   The first reason is: "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it;
   but whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it." In this
   startling paradox the word "life" is used in a double sense. In the
   first clause of each member of the sentence it signifies natural life,
   with all the adjuncts that make it pleasant and enjoyable; in the
   second, it means the spiritual life of a renewed soul. The deep,
   pregnant saying may therefore be thus expanded and paraphrased:
   Whosoever will save, i.e., make it his first business to save or
   preserve, his natural life and worldly wellbeing, shall lose the higher
   life, the life indeed; and whosoever is willing to lose his natural
   life for my sake shall find the true eternal life. According to this
   maxim we must lose something, it is not possible to live without
   sacrifice of some kind; the only question being what shall be
   sacrificed -- the lower or the higher life, animal happiness or
   spiritual blessedness. If we choose the higher, we must be prepared to
   deny ourselves and take up our cross, though the actual amount of the
   loss we are called on to bear may be small; for godliness is profitable
   unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, as well as of
   that which is to come. [311] If, on the other hand, we choose the
   lower, and resolve to have it at all hazards, we must inevitably lose
   the higher. The soul's life, and all the imperishable goods of the
   soul, -- righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness,
   [312] -- are the price we pay for worldly enjoyment.

   This price is too great: and that is what Jesus next told His hearers
   as the second persuasive to cross-bearing. "For what," He went on to
   ask, "is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his
   own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?" The two
   questions set forth the incomparable value of the soul on both sides of
   a commercial transaction. The soul, or life, in the true sense of the
   word, [313] is too dear a price to pay even for the whole world, not to
   say for that small portion of it which falls to the lot of any one
   individual. He who gains the world at such a cost is a loser by the
   bargain. On the other hand, the whole world is too small, yea, an
   utterly inadequate price, to pay for the ransom of the soul once lost.
   What shall a man give in exchange for the priceless thing he has
   foolishly bartered away? "Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and
   bow myself before the high God? shall I come before Him with
   burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? will the Lord be pleased
   with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I
   give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the
   sin of my soul?" [314] No! O man; not any of these things, nor any
   thing else thou hast to give; not the fruit of thy merchandise, not ten
   thousands of pounds sterling. Thou canst not buy back thy soul, which
   thou hast bartered for the world, with all that thou hast of the world.
   The redemption of the soul is indeed precious; it cannot be delivered
   from the bondage of sin by corruptible things, such as silver and gold:
   the attempt to purchase pardon and peace and life that way can only
   make thy case more hopeless, and add to thy condemnation.

   The appeal contained in these solemn questions comes home with
   irresistible force to all who are in their right mind. Such feel that
   no outward good can be compared in value to having a "saved soul," i.
   e. being a right-minded Christian man. All, however, are not so minded.
   Multitudes account their souls of very small value indeed. Judas sold
   his soul for thirty pieces of silver; and not a few who probably deem
   themselves better that he would part with theirs for the most paltry
   worldly advantage. The great ambition of the million is to be happy as
   animals, not to be blessed as "saved," noble-spirited, sanctified men.
   "Who will show us any good?" is that which the many say. "Give us
   health, wealth, houses, lands, honors, and we care not for
   righteousness, either imputed or personal, peace of conscience, joy in
   the Holy Ghost. These may be good also in their way, and if one could
   have them along with the other, without trouble or sacrifice, it were
   perhaps well; but we cannot consent, for their sakes, to deny ourselves
   any pleasure, or voluntarily endure any hardship."

   The third argument in favor of cross-bearing is drawn from the second
   advent. "For the son of man shall come in the glory of His Father, with
   His angels; and then shall He reward every man according to his works."
   [315] These words suggest a contrast between the present and the future
   state of the speaker, and imply a promise of a corresponding contrast
   between the present and the future of His faithful followers. Now Jesus
   is the Son of man, destined ere many weeks pass to be crucified at
   Jerusalem. At the end of the days He will appear invested with the
   manifest glory of Messiah, attended with a mighty host of ministering
   spirits; His reward for enduring the cross, despising the shame. Then
   will He reward every man according to the tenor of his present life. To
   the cross-bearers He will grant a crown of righteousness; to the
   cross-spurners He will assign, as their due, shame and everlasting
   contempt. Stern doctrine, distasteful to the modern mind on various
   grounds, specially on these two: because it sets before us alternatives
   in the life beyond, and because it seeks to propagate heroic virtue by
   hope of reward, instead of exhibiting virtue as its own reward. As to
   the former, the alternative of the promised reward is certainly a great
   mystery and burden to the spirit; but it is to be feared that an
   alternative is involved in any earnest doctrine of moral distinctions
   or of human freedom and responsibility. As to the other, Christians
   need not be afraid of degenerating into moral vulgarity in Christ's
   company. There is no vulgarity or impurity in the virtue which is
   sustained by the hope of eternal life. That hope is not selfishness,
   but simply self-consistency. It is simply believing in the reality of
   the kingdom for which you labor and suffer; involving, of course, the
   reality of each individual Christian's interest therein, your own not
   excepted. And such faith is necessary to heroism. For who would fight
   and suffer for a dream? What patriot would risk his life for his
   country's cause who did not hope for the restoration of her
   independence? And who but a pedant would say that the purity of his
   patriotism was sullied, because his hope for the whole nation did not
   exclude all reference to himself as an individual citizen? Equally
   necessary is it that a Christian should believe in the kingdom of
   glory, and equally natural and proper that he should cherish the hope
   of a personal share in its honors and felicities. Where such faith and
   hope are not, little Christian heroism will be found. For as an ancient
   Church Father said, "There is no certain work where there is an
   uncertain reward." [316] Men cannot be heroes in doubt or despair. They
   cannot struggle after perfection and a divine kingdom, sceptical the
   while whether these things be more than devout imaginations,
   unrealizable ideals. In such a mood they will take things easy, and
   make secular happiness their chief concern. [317]

13. THE TRANSFIGURATION

    Matt. 17:1-13; Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36.

   The transfiguration is one of those passages in the Saviour's earthly
   history which an expositor would rather pass over in reverent silence.
   For such silence the same apology might be pleaded which is so kindly
   made in the Gospel narrative for Peter's foolish speech concerning the
   three tabernacles: "He wist not what to say." Who does know what to say
   any more than he? Who is able fully to speak of that wondrous
   night-scene among the mountains, [318] during which heaven was for a
   few brief moments let down to earth, and the mortal body of Jesus being
   transfigured shone with celestial brightness, and the spirits of just
   men made perfect appeared and held converse with Him respecting His
   approaching passion, and a voice came forth from the excellent glory,
   pronouncing Him to be God's well-beloved Son? It is too high for us,
   this august spectacle, we cannot attain unto it; its grandeur oppresses
   and stupefies; its mystery surpasses our comprehension; its glory is
   ineffable. Therefore, avoiding all speculation, curious questioning,
   theological disquisition, and ambitious word-picturing in connection
   with the remarkable occurrence here recorded, we confine ourselves in
   this chapter to the humble task of explaining briefly its significance
   for Jesus Himself, and its lesson for His disciples.

   The "transfiguration," to be understood, must be viewed in connection
   with the announcement made by Jesus shortly before it happened,
   concerning His death. This it evident from the simple fact, that the
   three evangelists who relate the event so carefully note the time of
   its occurrence with reference to that announcement, and the
   conversation which accompanied it. All tell how, within six or eight
   days thereafter, [319] Jesus took three of His disciples, Peter, James,
   and John, and brought them into an high mountain apart, and was
   transfigured before them. The Gospel historians are not wont to be so
   careful in their indications of time, and their minute accuracy here
   signifies in effect: "While the foregoing communications and discourses
   concerning the cross were fresh in the thoughts of all the parties, the
   wondrous events we are now to relate took place." The relative date, in
   fact, is a finger post pointing back to the conversation on the
   passion, and saying: "If you desire to understand what follows,
   remember what went before."

   This inference from the note of time given by all the evangelists is
   fully borne out by a statement made by Luke alone, respecting the
   subject of the conversation on the holy mount between Jesus and His
   celestial visitants. "And," we read, "behold, there talked with Him two
   men, which were Moses and Elias; who appeared in glory, and spake of
   His decease (or exodus) which He should accomplish at Jerusalem." [320]
   That exit, so different from their own in its circumstances and
   consequences, was the theme of their talk. They had appeared to Jesus
   to converse with Him thereon; and when they ceased speaking concerning
   it, they took their departure for the abodes of the blessed. How long
   the conference lasted we know not, but the subject was sufficiently
   suggestive of interesting topics of conversation. There was, e.g, the
   surprising contrast between the death of Moses, immediate and painless,
   while his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated, and the painful
   and ignominious death to be endured by Jesus. Then there was the not
   less remarkable contrast between the manner of Elijah's departure from
   the earth -- translated to heaven without tasting death at all, making
   a triumphant exit out of the world in a chariot of fire, and the way by
   which Jesus should enter into glory -- the via dolorosa of the cross.
   Whence this privilege of exemption from death, or from its bitterness,
   granted to the representatives of the law and the prophets, and
   wherefore denied to Him who was the end both of law and of prophecy? On
   these points, and others of kindred nature, the two celestial
   messengers, enlightened by the clear light of heaven, may have held
   intelligent and sympathetic converse with the Son of man, to the
   refreshment of His weary, saddened, solitary soul.

   The same evangelist who specifies the subject of conversation on the
   holy mount further records that, previous to His transfiguration, Jesus
   had been engaged in prayer. We may therefore see, in the honor and
   glory conferred on Him there, the Father's answer to His Son's
   supplications; and from the nature of the answer we may infer the
   subject of prayer. It was the same as afterwards in the garden of
   Gethsemane. The cup of death was present to the mind of Jesus now, as
   then; the cross was visible to His spiritual eye; and He prayed for
   nerve to drink, for courage to endure. The attendance of the three
   confidential disciples, Peter, James, and John, significantly hints at
   the similarity of the two occasions. The Master took these disciples
   with Him into the mount, as He afterwards took them into the garden,
   that He might not be altogether destitute of company and kindly
   sympathy as He walked through the valley of the shadow of death, and
   felt the horror and the loneliness of the situation.

   It is now clear how we must view the transfiguration scene in relation
   to Jesus. It was an aid to faith and patience, specially vouchsafed to
   the meek and lowly Son of man, in answer to His prayers, to cheer Him
   on His sorrowful path towards Jerusalem and Calvary. Three distinct
   aids to His faith were supplied in the experiences of that wondrous
   night. The first was a foretaste of the glory with which He should be
   rewarded after His passion, for His voluntary humiliation and obedience
   unto death. For the moment He was, as it were, rapt up into heaven,
   where He had been before He came into the world; for His face shone
   like the sun, and His raiment was white as the pure untrodden snow on
   the high alpine summits of Herman. "Be of good cheer," said that sudden
   flood of celestial light: "the suffering will soon be past, and Thou
   shalt enter into Thine eternal joy!"

   A second source of comfort to Jesus in the experiences on the mount,
   was the assurance that the mystery of the cross was understood and
   appreciated by saints in heaven, if not by the darkened minds of sinful
   men on earth. He greatly needed such comfort; for among the men then
   living, not excepting His chosen disciples, there was not one to whom
   He could speak on that theme with any hope of eliciting an intelligent
   and sympathetic response. Only a few days ago, He had ascertained by
   painful experience the utter incapacity of the twelve, even of the most
   quick-witted and warm-hearted among them, to comprehend the mystery of
   His passion, or even to believe in it as a certain fact. Verily the Son
   of man was most lonely as He passed through the dark valley! the very
   presence of stupid, unsympathetic companions serving only to enhance
   the sense of solitariness. When He wanted company that could understand
   His passion thoughts, He was obliged to hold converse with spirits of
   just men made perfect; for, as far as mortal men were concerned, He had
   to be content to finish His great work without the comfort of being
   understood until it was accomplished.

   The talk of the great lawgiver and of the great prophet of Israel on
   the subject of His death was doubtless a real solace to the spirit of
   Jesus. We know how He comforted Himself at other times with the thought
   of being understood in heaven if not on earth. When heartless Pharisees
   called in question His conduct in receiving sinners, He sought at once
   His defense and His consolation in the blessed fact that there was joy
   in heaven at least, whatever there might be among them, over one
   penitent sinner, more than over ninety and nine just persons that
   needed no repentance. When He thought how "little ones," the weak and
   helpless, were despised and trampled under foot in this proud inhuman
   world, He reflected with unspeakable satisfaction that in heaven their
   angels did always behold the face of His Father; yea, that in heaven
   there were angels who made the care of little ones their special
   business, and were therefore fully able to appreciate the doctrine of
   humility and kindness which He strove to inculcate on ambitious and
   quarrelsome disciples. Surely, then, we may believe that when He looked
   forward to His own decease -- the crowning evidence of His love for
   sinners -- it was a comfort to His heart to think: "Up yonder they know
   that I am to suffer, and comprehend the reason why, and watch with
   eager interest to see how I move on with unfaltering step, with my face
   steadfastly set to go to Jerusalem." And would it not be specially
   comforting to have sensible evidence of this, in an actual visit from
   two denizens of the upper world, deputed as it were and commissioned to
   express the general mind of the whole community of glorified saints,
   who understood that their presence in heaven was due to the merits of
   that sacrifice which He was about to offer up in His own person on the
   hill of Calvary?

   A third, and the chief solace to the heart of Jesus, was the approving
   voice of His heavenly Father: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
   well pleased." That voice, uttered then, meant: "Go on Thy present way,
   self-devoted to death, and shrinking not from the cross. I am pleased
   with Thee, because Thou pleasest not Thyself. Pleased with Thee at all
   times, I am most emphatically delighted with Thee when, in a signal
   manner, as lately in the announcement made to Thy disciples, Thou dost
   show it to be Thy fixed purpose to save others, and not to save
   Thyself."

   This voice from the excellent glory was one of three uttered by the
   divine Father in the hearing of His Son during His life on earth. The
   first was uttered by the Jordan, after the baptism of Jesus, and was
   the same as the present, save that it was spoken to Him, not concerning
   Him, to others. The last was uttered at Jerusalem shortly before the
   crucifixion, and was of similar import with the two preceding, but
   different in form. The soul of Jesus being troubled with the near
   prospect of death, He prayed: "Father, save me from this hour; but for
   this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify Thy name." Then, we
   read, came there a voice from heaven, saying: "I have both glorified it
   (by Thy life), and will glorify it again" (more signally by Thy death).
   All three voices served one end. Elicited at crises in Christ's
   history, when He manifested in peculiar intensity His devotion to the
   work for which He had come into the world, and His determination to
   finish it, however irksome the task might be to flesh and blood, these
   voices expressed, for His encouragement and strengthening, the
   complacency with which His Father regarded His self-humiliation and
   obedience unto death. At His baptism, He, so to speak, confessed the
   sins of the whole world; and by submitting to the rite, expressed His
   purpose to fulfill all righteousness as the Redeemer from sin.
   Therefore the Father then, for the first time, pronounced Him His
   beloved Son. Shortly before the transfiguration He had energetically
   repelled the suggestion of an affectionate disciple, that He should
   save Himself from His anticipated doom, as a temptation of the devil;
   therefore the Father renewed the declaration, changing the second
   person into the third, for the sake of those disciples who were
   present, and specially of Peter, who had listened to the voice of his
   own heart rather than to his Master's words. Finally, a few days before
   His death, He overcame a temptation of the same nature as that to which
   Peter had subjected Him, springing this time out of the sinless
   infirmity of His own human nature. Beginning His prayer with the
   expression of a wish to be saved from the dark hour, He ended it with
   the petition, "Glorify Thy name." Therefore the Father once more
   repeated the expression of His approval, declaring in effect His
   satisfaction with the way in which His Son had glorified His name
   hitherto, and His confidence that He would not fail to crown His career
   of obedience by a God-glorifying death.

   Such being the meaning of the vision on the mount for Jesus, we have
   now to consider what lesson it taught the disciples who were present,
   and through them their brethren and all Christians.

   The main point in this connection is the injunction appended to the
   heavenly voice: "Hear Him." This command refers specially to the
   doctrine of the cross preached by Jesus to the twelve, and so ill
   received by them. It was meant to be a solemn, deliberate endorsement
   of all that He had said then concerning His own sufferings, and
   concerning the obligation to bear their cross lying on all His
   followers. Peter, James, and John were, as it were, invited to recall
   all that had fallen from their Master's lips on the unwelcome topic,
   and assured that it was wholly true and in accordance with the divine
   mind. Nay, as these disciples had received the doctrine with murmurs of
   disapprobation, the voice from heaven addressed to them was a stern
   word of rebuke, which said: "Murmur not, but devoutly and obediently
   hear."

   This rebuke was all the more needful, that the disciples had just shown
   that they were still of the same mind as they had been six days ago.
   Peter at least was as yet in no cross-bearing humor. When, on wakening
   up to clear consciousness from the drowsy fit which had fallen on him,
   that disciple observed the two strangers in the act of departing, he
   exclaimed: "Master, it is good for us to be here, and let us make three
   tabernacles; one for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias." He
   was minded, we perceive, to enjoy the felicities of heaven without any
   preliminary process of cross-bearing. He thought to himself: "How much
   better to abide up here with the saints than down below amidst
   unbelieving captious Pharisees and miserable human beings, enduring the
   contradiction of sinners, and battling with the manifold ills wherewith
   the earth is cursed! Stay here, my Master, and you may bid good-by to
   all those dark forebodings of coming sufferings, and will be beyond the
   reach of malevolent priests, elders, and scribes. Stay here, on this
   sun-lit, heaven-kissing hill; go no more down into the depressing,
   sombre valley of humiliation. Farewell, earth and the cross: welcome,
   heaven and the crown!"

   We do not forget, while thus paraphrasing Peter's foolish speech, that
   when he uttered it he was dazed with sleep and the splendors of the
   midnight scene. Yet, when due allowance has been made for this, it
   remains true that the idle suggestion was an index of the disciple's
   present mind. Peter was drunken, though not with wine; but what men
   say, even when drunken, is characteristic. There was a sober meaning in
   his senseless speech about the tabernacle. He really meant that the
   celestial visitants should remain, and not go away, as they were in the
   act of doing when he spoke. [321] This appears from the conversation
   which took place between Jesus and the three disciples while descending
   the mountain. [322] Peter and his two companions asked their Master:
   "Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?" The question
   referred, we think, not to the injunction laid on the disciples by
   Jesus just before, "Tell the vision to no man until the Son of man be
   risen again from the dead," but rather to the fugitive, fleeting
   character of the whole scene on the mountain. The three brethren were
   not only disappointed, but perplexed, that the two celestials had been
   so like angels in the shortness of their stay and the suddenness of
   their departure. They had accepted the current notion about the advent
   of Elias before, and in order to, the restoration of the kingdom; and
   they fondly hoped that this was he come at last in company with Moses,
   heralding the approaching glory, as the advent of swallows from
   tropical climes is a sign that summer is nigh, and that winter with its
   storms and rigors is over and gone. In truth, while their Master was
   preaching the cross they had been dreaming of crowns. We shall find
   them continuing so to dream till the very end.

   "Hear ye Him:." -- this voice was not meant for the three disciples
   alone, or even for the twelve, but for all professed followers of
   Christ as well as for them. It says to every Christian: "Hear Jesus,
   and strive to understand Him while He speaks of the mystery of His
   sufferings and the glory that should follow -- those themes which even
   angels desire to look into. Hear Him when He proclaims cross-bearing as
   a duty incumbent on all disciples, and listen not to self-indulgent
   suggestions of flesh and blood, or the temptations of Satan counseling
   thee to make self-interest or self-preservation thy chief end. Hear
   Him, yet again, and weary not of the world, nor seek to lay down thy
   burden before the time. Dream not of tabernacles where thou mayest
   dwell secure, like a hermit in the wild, having no share in all that is
   done beneath the circuit of the sun. Do thy part manfully, and in due
   season thou shalt have, not a tent, but a temple to dwell in: an house
   not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

   It is true, indeed, that we who are in this tabernacle of the body, in
   this world of sorrow, cannot but groan now and then, being burdened.
   This is our infirmity, and in itself it is not sinful; neither is it
   wrong to heave an occasional sigh, and utter a passing wish that the
   time of cross-bearing were over. Even the holy Jesus felt at times this
   weariness of life. An expression of something like impatience escaped
   His lips at this very season. When He came down from the mount and
   learned what was going on at its base, He exclaimed, with reference at
   once to the unbelief of the scribes who were present, to the weak faith
   of the disciples, and to the miseries of mankind suffering the
   consequences of the curse: "O faithless and perverse generation, how
   long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?" Even the loving
   Redeemer of man felt tempted to be weary in well-doing -- weary of
   encountering the contradiction of sinners and of bearing with the
   spiritual weakness of disciples. Such weariness therefore, as a
   momentary feeling, is not necessarily sinful: it may rather be a part
   of our cross. But it must not be indulged in or yielded to. Jesus did
   not give Himself up to the feeling. Though He complained of the
   generation amidst which He lived, He did not cease from His labors of
   love for its benefit. Having relieved His heart by this utterance of a
   reproachful exclamation, He gave orders that the poor lunatic should be
   brought to Him that he might be healed. Then, when He had wrought this
   new miracle of mercy, He patiently explained to His own disciples the
   cause of their impotence to cope successfully with the maladies of men,
   and taught them how they might attain the power of casting out all
   sorts of devils, even those whose hold of their victims was most
   obstinate, viz. by faith and prayer. [323] So He continued laboring in
   helping the miserable and instructing the ignorant, till the hour came
   when He could truly say, "It is finished."

14. TRAINING IN TEMPER; OR, DISCOURSE ON HUMILITY
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. AS THIS LITTLE CHILD

    Matt. 18:1-14; Mark 9:33-37; Mark 9:42-50; Luke 9:46-48.

   From the Mount of Transfiguration Jesus and the twelve returned through
   Galilee to Capernaum. On this homeward journey the Master and His
   disciples were in very different moods of mind. He sadly mused on His
   cross; they vainly dreamed of places of distinction in the approaching
   kingdom. The diversity of spirit revealed itself in a corresponding
   diversity of conduct. Jesus for the second time began to speak on the
   way of His coming sufferings, telling His followers how the Son of man
   should be betrayed into the hands of men, and how they should kill Him,
   and how the third day He should be raised again. [324] The twelve, on
   the other hand, began as they journeyed along to dispute among
   themselves who should be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. [325]
   Strange, humiliating contrast exhibited again and again in the
   evangelic history; jealous, angry altercations respecting rank and
   precedence, on the part of the disciples, following new communications
   respecting His passion on the part of their Lord, as comic follows
   tragic in a dramatic representation.

   This unseemly and unseasonable dispute shows clearly what need there
   was for that injunction appended to the voice from heaven, "Hear Him;."
   and how far the disciples were as yet from complying therewith. They
   heard Jesus only when He spake things agreeable. They listened with
   pleasure when He assured them that ere long they should see the Son of
   man come in His kingdom; they were deaf to all He said concerning the
   suffering which must precede the glory. They forgot the cross, after a
   momentary fit of sorrow when their Lord referred to it, and betook
   themselves to dreaming of the crown; as a child forgets the death of a
   parent, and returns to its play. "How great," thought they, "shall we
   all be when the kingdom comes!" Then by an easy transition they passed
   from idle dreams of the common glory to idle disputes as to who should
   have the largest share therein; for vanity and jealousy lie very near
   each other. "Shall we all be equally distinguished in the kingdom, or
   shall one be higher than another? Does the favor shown to Peter, James,
   and John, in selecting them to be eye-witnesses of the prefigurement of
   the coming glory, imply a corresponding precedence in the kingdom
   itself?" [326] The three disciples probably hoped it did; the other
   disciples hoped not, and so the dispute began. It was nothing that they
   should all be great together; the question of questions was, who should
   be the greatest -- a question hard to settle when vanity and
   presumption contend on one side, and jealousy and envy on the other.

   Arrived at Capernaum, Jesus took an early opportunity of adverting to
   the dispute in which His disciples had been engaged, and made it the
   occasion of delivering a memorable discourse on humility and kindred
   topics, designed to serve the purpose of disciplining their temper and
   will. The task to which He now addressed Himself was at once the most
   formidable and the most needful He had as yet undertaken in connection
   with the training of the twelve. Most formidable, for nothing is harder
   than to train the human will into loyal subjection to universal
   principles, to bring men to recognize the claims of the law of love in
   their mutual relations, to expel pride, ambition, vainglory, and
   jealousy, and envy from the hearts even of the good. Men may have made
   great progress in the art of prayer, in religious liberty, in Christian
   activity, may have shown themselves faithful in times of temptation,
   and apt scholars in Christian doctrine, and yet prove signally
   defective in temper: self-willed, self-seeking, having an eye to their
   own glory, even when seeking to glorify God. Most needful, for what
   good could these disciples do as ministers of the kingdom so long as
   their main concern was about their own place therein? Men full of
   ambitious passions and jealous of each other could only quarrel among
   themselves, bring the cause they sought to promote into contempt, and
   breed all around them confusion and every evil work. No wonder then
   that Jesus from this time forth devoted Himself with peculiar
   earnestness to the work of casting out from His disciples the devil of
   self-will, and imparting to them as a salt His own spirit of meekness,
   humility, and charity. He knew how much depended on His success in this
   effort to salt the future apostles, to use His own strong figure, [327]
   and the whole tone and substance of the discourse before us reveal the
   depth of His anxiety. Specially significant in this respect is the
   opening part in which He makes use of a child present in the chamber as
   the vehicle of instruction; so, out of the mouth of a babe and
   suckling, perfecting the praise of a lowly mind. Sitting in the midst
   of ambitious disciples with the little one in His arms for a text, He
   who is the greatest in the kingdom proceeds to set forth truths
   mortifying to the spirit of pride, but sweeter than honey to the taste
   of all renewed souls.

   The first lesson taught is this: To be great in the kingdom, yea, to
   gain admission into it at all, it is necessary to become like a little
   child. "Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall
   not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever, therefore, shall
   humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the
   kingdom of heaven." The feature of child-nature which forms the special
   point of comparison is its unpretentiousness. Early childhood knows
   nothing of those distinctions of rank which are the offspring of human
   pride, and the prizes coveted by human ambition. A king's child will
   play without scruple with a beggar's, thereby unconsciously asserting
   the insignificance of the things in which men differ, compared with the
   things that are common to all. What children are unconsciously, that
   Jesus requires His disciples to be voluntarily and deliberately. They
   are not to be pretentious and ambitious, like the grown children of the
   world, but meek and lowly of heart; disregarding rank and distinctions,
   thinking not of their place in the kingdom, but giving themselves up in
   simplicity of spirit to the service of the King. In this sense, the
   greatest one in the kingdom, the King Himself, was the humblest of men.
   Of humility in the form of self-depreciation or self-humiliation on
   account of sin Jesus could know nothing, for there was no defect or
   fault in His character. But of the humility which consists in
   self-forgetfulness He was the perfect pattern. We cannot say that He
   thought little of Himself, but we may say that He thought not of
   Himself at all: He thought only of the Father's glory and of man's
   good. Considerations of personal aggrandizement had no place among His
   motives. He shrank with holy abhorrence from all who were influenced by
   such considerations; no character appearing so utterly detestable in
   His eye as that of the Pharisee, whose religion was a theatrical
   exhibition, always presupposing the presence of spectators, and who
   loved the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the
   synagogues, and to be called of men Rabbi, Rabbi. For Himself He
   neither desired nor received honor from men. He came not to be
   ministered unto, but to minister: He, the greatest, humbled Himself to
   be the least -- to be a child born in a stable and laid in a manger; to
   be a man of sorrow, lightly esteemed by the world; yea, to be nailed to
   a cross. By such wondrous self-humiliation He showed His divine
   greatness.

   The higher we rise in the kingdom the more we shall be like Jesus in
   this humbling of Himself. Childlikeness such as He exhibited is an
   invariable characteristic of spiritual advancement, even as its absence
   is the mark of moral littleness. The little man, even when
   well-intentioned, is ever consequential and scheming, -- ever thinking
   of himself, his honor, dignity, reputation, even when professedly doing
   good. He always studies to glorify God in a way that shall at the same
   time glorify himself. Frequently above the love of gain, he is never
   above the feeling of self-importance. The great ones in the kingdom, on
   the other hand, throw themselves with such unreservedness into the work
   to which they are called, that they have neither time nor inclination
   to inquire what place they shall obtain in this world or the next.
   Leaving consequences to the great Governor and Lord, and forgetful of
   self-interest, they give their whole soul to their appointed task;
   content to fill a little space or a large one, as God shall appoint, if
   only He be glorified.

   This is the true road to a high place in the eternal kingdom. For be it
   observed, Jesus did not summarily dismiss the question, who is greatest
   in the kingdom, by negativing the existence of distinctions therein. He
   said not on this occasion, He said not on any other, "It is needless to
   ask who is the greatest in the kingdom: there is no such thing as a
   distinction of greater and less there." On the contrary, it is implied
   here, and it is asserted elsewhere, that there is such a thing.
   According to the doctrine of Christ, the supernal commonwealth has no
   affinity with jealous radicalism, which demands that all shall be
   equal. There are grades of distinction there as well as in the kingdoms
   of this world. The difference between the divine kingdom and all others
   lies in the principle on which promotion proceeds. Here the proud and
   the ambitious gain the post of honor; there honors are conferred on the
   humble and the self-forgetful. He that on earth was willing to be the
   least in lowly love will be the great one in the kingdom of heaven.

   The next lesson Jesus taught His disciples was the duty of receiving
   little ones; that is, not merely children in the literal sense, but all
   that a child represents -- the weak, the insignificant, the helpless.
   The child which He held in His arms having served as a type of the
   humble in spirit, next became a type of the humble in station,
   influence, and importance; and having been presented to the disciples
   in the former capacity as an object of imitation, was commended to them
   in the latter as an object of kind treatment. They were to receive the
   little ones graciously and lovingly, careful not to offend them by
   harsh, heartless, contemptuous conduct. All such kindness He, Jesus,
   would receive as done to Himself.

   This transition of thought from being like a child to receiving all
   that of which childhood in its weakness is the emblem, was perfectly
   natural; for there is a close connection between the selfish struggle
   to be great and an offensive mode of acting towards the little.
   Harshness and contemptuousness are vices inseparable from an ambitious
   spirit. An ambitious man is not, indeed, necessarily cruel in his
   disposition, and capable of cherishing heartless designs in cold blood.
   At times, when the demon that possesses him is quiescent, the idea of
   hurting a child, or any thing that a child represents, may appear to
   him revolting; and he might resent the imputation of any such design,
   or even a hint at the possibility of his harboring it, as a wanton
   insult. "Is thy servant a dog?" asked Hazael indignantly at Elisha,
   when the prophet described to him his own future self, setting the
   strongholds of Israel on fire, slaying their young men with the sword,
   dashing their children to the earth, and ripping up their women with
   child. At the moment his horror of these crimes was quite sincere, and
   yet he was guilty of them all. The prophet rightly divined his
   character, and read his future career of splendid wickedness in the
   light of it. He saw that he was ambitious, and all the rest followed as
   a matter of course. The king of Syria, his master, about whose recovery
   he affected solicitude, he should first put to death; and once on the
   throne, the same ambition that made him a murderer would goad him on to
   schemes of conquest, in the prosecution of which he should perpetrate
   all the barbarous cruelties in which Oriental tyrants seemed to take
   fiendish delight.

   The crimes of ambition, and the lamentations with which it has filled
   the earth, are a moral commonplace. Full well aware of the fact, Jesus
   exclaimed, as the havoc already wrought and yet to be wrought by the
   lust for place and power rose in vision before His eye: "Woe to the
   world because of offences!" Woe indeed, but not merely to the
   wrong-sufferer; the greater woe is reserved for the wrong-doer. So
   Jesus taught His disciples, when He added: "but woe to that man by whom
   the offence cometh!" Nor did He leave His hearers in the dark as to the
   nature of the offender's doom. "Whoso," He declared, in language which
   came forth from His lips like a flame of righteous indignation at
   thought of the wrongs inflicted on the weak and helpless, -- " Whoso
   shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were
   better for him that a mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and that
   he were drowned in the depth of the sea." "It were better for him " --
   or, it suits him, it is what he deserves; and it is implied, though not
   expressed, that it is what he gets when divine vengeance at length
   overtakes him. The mill-stone is no idle figure of speech, but an
   appropriate emblem of the ultimate doom of the proud. He who will mount
   to the highest place, regardless of the injuries he may inflict on
   little ones, shall be cast down, not to earth merely, but to the very
   lowest depths of the ocean, to the very abyss of hell, with a heavy
   weight of curses suspended on his neck to sink him down, and keep him
   down, so that he shall rise no more. [328] "They sank as lead in the
   mighty waters! "

   Such being the awful doom of selfish ambition, it were wise in the
   high-minded to fear, and to anticipate God's judgment by judging
   themselves. This Jesus counselled His disciples to do by repeating a
   stern saying uttered once before in the Sermon on the Mount, concerning
   the cutting off offending members of the body. [329] At first view that
   saying appears irrelevant here, because the subject of discourse is
   offences against others, not offences against one's self. But its
   relevancy becomes evident when we consider that all offences against a
   brother are offences against ourselves. That is the very point Christ
   wishes to impress on His disciples. He would have them understand that
   self-interest dictates scrupulous care in avoiding offences to the
   little ones. "Rather than harm one of these," says the great Teacher in
   effect, "by hand, foot, eye, or tongue, have recourse to
   self-mutilation; for he that sinneth against even the least in the
   kingdom, sinneth also against his own soul."

   One thing more Jesus taught His disciples while He held the child in
   His arms, viz. that those who injured or despised little ones were
   entirely out of harmony with the mind of Heaven. "Take heed," said He,
   "that ye despise not one of these little ones;." and then He proceeded
   to enforce the warning by drawing aside the veil, and showing them a
   momentary glimpse of that very celestial kingdom in which they were all
   so desirous to have prominence. "Lo, there! see those angels standing
   before the throne of God -- these be ministering spirits to the little
   ones! And lo, here am I, the Son of God, come all the way from heaven
   to save them! And behold how the face of the Father in heaven smiles on
   the angels and on me because we take such loving interest in them!"
   [330] How eloquent the argument! how powerful the appeal! "The
   inhabitants of heaven," such is its drift, "are loving and humble; ye
   are selfish and proud. What hope can ye cherish of admission into a
   kingdom, the spirit of which is so utterly diverse from that by which
   ye are animated? Nay, are ye not ashamed of yourselves when ye witness
   this glaring contrast between the lowliness of the celestials and the
   pride and pretensions of puny men? Put away, henceforth and forever,
   vain, ambitious thoughts, and let the meek and gentle spirit of Heaven
   get possession of your hearts."

   In the beautiful picture of the upper world one thing is specially
   noteworthy, viz. the introduction by Jesus of a reference to His work
   as the Saviour of the lost, into an argument designed to enforce care
   for the little ones. [331] The reference is not an irrelevance; it is
   of the nature of an argument Ã  fortiori. If the Son of man cared for
   the lost, the low, the morally degraded, how much more will He care for
   those who are merely little! It is a far greater effort of love to seek
   the salvation of the wicked than to interest one's self in the weak;
   and He who did the one will certainly not fail to do the other. In
   adverting to His love as the Saviour of the sinful, as set forth in the
   parable of the good shepherd going after the straying sheep, [332]
   Jesus further directed the attention of His disciples to the sublimest
   example of humility. For that love shows that there was not only no
   pride of greatness in the Son of God, but also no pride of holiness. He
   could not only condescend to men of humble estate, but could even
   become the brother of the vile: one with them in sympathy and lot, that
   they might become one with Him in privilege and character. Once more,
   in making reference to His own love as the Saviour, Jesus pointed out
   to His disciples the true source of that charity which careth for the
   weak and despiseth not the little. No one who rightly appreciated His
   love could deliberately offend or heartlessly contemn any brother,
   however insignificant, who had a place in His Saviour-sympathies. The
   charity of the Son of man, in the eyes of all true disciples, surrounds
   with a halo of sacredness the meanest and vilest of the human race.

   connection of thought. As to the former point, we agree with Alford in
   thinking that ver. 11 cannot be interpolated from Luke, "lst, from the
   absence of any sufficient reason (apparent on the surface) for
   insertion; 2d, from the nearly unanimous omission of Luke's zetesai
   kai, which would have exactly suited the zetei of ver. 12." That it
   should form a part of the text in a critical edition of the Greek
   Testament we do not assert, but it is quite credible to us that Christ
   uttered such a sentiment on this occasion. The thought is germain to
   the connection, however awkwardly it may come in in the narrative. For
   a similar reason, we think it quite likely that the parable of the good
   shepherd was spoken at this time. It was just as much needed to rebuke
   the ambitious spirit of disciples as to ward off the assaults of
   censorious Pharisees.

  SECTION II. CHURCH DISCIPLINE

    Matt. xviii. 15-20.

   Having duly cautioned His hearers against offending the little ones,
   Jesus proceeded (according to the account of His words in the Gospel of
   Matthew) to tell them how to act when they were not the givers, but the
   receivers or the judges, of offences. In this part of His discourse He
   had in view the future rather than the present. Contemplating the time
   when the kingdom -- that is, the church -- should be in actual
   existence as an organized community, with the twelve exercising in it
   authority as apostles, He gives directions for the exercise of
   discipline, in order to the purity and wellbeing of the Christian
   brotherhood; [333] confers on the twelve collectively what He had
   already granted to Peter singly -- the power to bind and loose, that
   is, to inflict and remove church censures; [334] and makes a most
   encouraging promise of His own spiritual presence, and of prevailing
   power with His heavenly Father in prayer, to all assembled in His name,
   and agreeing together in the objects of their desires. [335] His aim
   throughout is to insure beforehand that the community to be called
   after His name shall be indeed a holy, loving, united society.

   The rules here laid down for the guidance of the apostles in dealing
   with offenders, though simple and plain, have given rise to much debate
   among religious controversialist interested in the upholding of diverse
   theories of church government. [336] Of these ecclesiastical disputes
   we shall say nothing here; nor do we deem it needful to offer any
   expository comments on our Lord's words, save a sentence of explanation
   on the phrase employed by Him to describe the state of excommunication:
   "Let him" (that is, the impenitent brother about to be cast out of the
   church) "be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican." These words,
   luminous without doubt at the time they were spoken, are not quite so
   clear to us now; but yet their meaning in the main is sufficiently
   plain. The idea is, that the persistently impenitent offender is to
   become at length to the person he has offended, and to the whole
   church, one with whom is to be held no religious, and as little as
   possible social fellowship. The religious aspect of excommunication is
   pointed at by the expression "as an heathen man," and the social side
   of it is expressed in the second clause of the sentence, "and a
   publican." Heathens were excluded from the temple, and had no part in
   Jewish religious rites. Publicans were not excluded from the temple, so
   far as we know; but they were regarded as social pariahs by all Jews
   affecting patriotism and religious strictness. This indiscriminate
   dislike of the whole class was not justifiable, nor is any approval of
   it implied here. Jesus refers to it simply as a familiar matter of
   fact, which conveniently and clearly conveyed His meaning to the
   effect: Let the impenitent offender be to you what heathens are to all
   Jews by law -- persons with whom to hold no religious fellowship; and
   what publicans are to Pharisees by inveterate prejudice -- persons to
   be excluded from all but merely unavoidable social intercourse."

   Whatever obscurity may attach to the letter of the rules for the
   management of discipline, there can be no doubt at all as to the
   loving, holy spirit which pervades them.

   The spirit of love appears in the conception of the church which
   underlies these rules. The church is viewed as a commonwealth, in which
   the concern of one is the concern of all, and vice versa. Hence Jesus
   does not specify the class of offences He intends, whether private and
   personal ones, or such as are of the nature of scandals, that is,
   offences against the church as a whole. On His idea of a church such
   explanations were unnecessary, because the distinction alluded to in
   great part ceases to exist. An offence against the conscience of the
   whole community is an offence against each individual member, because
   he is jealous for the honor of the body of believers; and on the other
   hand, an offence which is in the first place private and personal,
   becomes one in which all are concerned so soon as the offended party
   has failed to bring His brother to confession and reconciliation. A
   chronic alienation between two Christian brethren will be regarded, in
   a church after Christ's mind, as a scandal not to be tolerated, because
   fraught with deadly harm to the spiritual life of all.

   Very congenial also to the spirit of charity is the order of proceeding
   indicated in the directions given by Jesus. First, strictly private
   dealing on the part of the offended with his offending brother is
   prescribed; then, after such dealing has been fairly tried and has
   failed, but not till then, third parties are to be brought in as
   witnesses and assistants in the work of reconciliation; and finally,
   and only as a last resource, the subject of quarrel is to be made
   public, and brought before the whole church. This method of procedure
   is obviously most considerate as towards the offender. It makes
   confession as easy to him as possible by sparing him the shame of
   exposure. It is also a method which cannot be worked out without the
   purest and holiest motives on the part of him who seeks redress. It
   leaves no room for the reckless talkativeness of the scandalmonger, who
   loves to divulge evil news, and speaks to everybody of a brother's
   faults rather than to the brother himself. It puts a bridle on the
   passion of resentment, by compelling the offended one to go through a
   patient course of dealing with his brother before he arrive at the sad
   issue at which anger jumps at once, viz. total estrangement. It gives
   no encouragement to the officious and over-zealous, who make themselves
   busy in ferreting out offences; for the way of such is not to begin
   with the offender, and then go to the church, but to go direct to the
   church with severe charges, based probably on hearsay information
   gained by dishonorable means.

   Characteristic of the loving spirit of Jesus, the Head of the church,
   is the horror with which He contemplates, and would have His disciples
   contemplate, the possibility of any one, once a brother, becoming to
   his brethren as a heathen or a publican. This appears in His insisting
   that no expedient shall be left untried to avert the sad catastrophe.
   How unlike in this respect is His mind to that of the world, which can
   with perfect equanimity allow vast multitudes of fellow-men to be what
   heathens were to Jews, and publicans to Pharisees -- persons excluded
   from all kindly communion! Nay, may we not say, how unlike the mind of
   Jesus in this matter to that of many even in the church, who treat
   brethren in the same outward fellowship with most perfect indifference,
   and have become so habituated to the evil practice, that they regard it
   without compunction as a quite natural and right state of things!

   Such heartless indifferentism implies a very different ideal of the
   church from that cherished by its Founder. Men who do not regard
   ecclesiastical fellowship as imposing any obligation to love their
   Christian brethren, think, consciously or unconsciously, of the church
   as if it were a hotel, where all kinds of people meet for a short
   space, sit down together at the same table, then part, neither knowing
   nor caring any thing about each other; while, in truth, it is rather a
   family, whose members are all brethren, bound to love each other with
   pure heart fervently. Of course this hotel theory involves as a
   necessary consequence the disuse of discipline. For, strange as the
   idea may seem to many, the law of love is the basis of church
   discipline. It is because I am bound to take every member of the church
   to my arms as a brother, that I am not only entitled, but bound, to be
   earnestly concerned about his behavior. If a brother in Christ,
   according to ecclesiastical standing, may say to me, "You must love me
   with all your heart," I am entitled to say in reply, "I acknowledge the
   obligation in the abstract, but I demand of you in turn that you shall
   be such that I can love you as a Christian, however weak and imperfect;
   and I feel it to be both my right and my duty to do all I can to make
   you worthy of such brotherly regard, by plain dealing with you anent
   your offences. I am willing to love you, but I cannot, I dare not, be
   on friendly terms with your sins; and if you refuse to part with these,
   and virtually require me to be a partaker in them by connivance, then
   our brotherhood is at an end, and I am free from my obligations." To
   such a language and such a style of thought the patron of the hotel
   theory of church fellowship is an utter stranger. Disclaiming the
   obligation to love his brethren, he at the same time renounces the
   right to insist on Christian virtue as an indispensable attribute of
   church membership, and declines to trouble himself about the behavior
   of any member, except in so far as it may affect himself personally.
   All may think and act as they please -- be infidels or believers, sons
   of God or sons of Belial: it is all one to him.

   Holy severity finds a place in these directions, as well as tender,
   considerate love. Jesus solemnly sanctions the excommunication of an
   impenitent offender. "Let him," saith He, with the tone of a judge
   pronouncing sentence of death, "be unto thee as an heathen man and a
   publican." Then, to invest church censures righteously administered
   with all possible solemnity and authority, He proceeds to declare that
   they carry with them eternal consequences; adding in His most emphatic
   manner the awful words -- awful both to the sinner cast out and to
   those who are responsible for his ejection: "Verily I say unto you,
   Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and
   whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven." The
   words may be regarded in one sense as a caution to ecclesiastical
   rulers to beware how they use a power of so tremendous a character; but
   they also plainly show that Christ desired His church on earth, as
   nearly as possible, to resemble the church in heaven: to be holy in her
   membership, and not an indiscriminate congregation of righteous and
   unrighteous men, of believers and infidels, of Christians and
   reprobates; and for that end committed the power of the keys to those
   who bear office in His house, authorizing them to deliver over to
   Satan's thrall the proud, stubborn sinner who refuses to be corrected,
   and to give satisfaction to the aggrieved consciences of his brethren.

   Such rigor, pitiless in appearance, is really merciful to all parties.
   It is merciful to the faithful members of the church, because it
   removes from their midst a mortifying limb, whose presence imperils the
   life of the whole body. Scandalous open sin cannot be tolerated in any
   society without general demoralization ensuing; least of all in the
   church, which is a society whose very raison d'Ãªtre is the culture of
   Christian virtue. But the apparently pitiless rigor is mercy even
   towards the unfaithful who are the subjects thereof. For to keep
   scandalous offenders inside the communion of the church is to do your
   best to damn their souls, and to exclude them ultimately from heaven.
   On the other hand, to deliver them over to Satan may be, and it is to
   be hoped will be, but giving them a foretaste of hell now that they may
   be saved from hell-fire forever. It was in this hope that Paul insisted
   on the excommunication of the incestuous person from the Corinthian
   church, that by the castigation of his fleshly sin "his spirit might be
   saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." It is this hope which comforts
   those on whom the disagreeable task of enforcing church censures falls
   in the discharge of their painful duty. They can cast forth evil-doers
   from the communion of saints with less hesitation, when they know that
   as "publicans and sinners" the excommunicated are nearer the kingdom of
   God than they were as church members, and when they consider that they
   are still permitted to seek the good of the ungodly, as Christ sought
   the good of all the outcasts of His day; that it is still in their
   power to pray for them, and to preach to them, as they stand in the
   outer court of the Gentiles, though they may not put into their unholy
   hands the symbols of the Saviour's body and blood.

   Such considerations, indeed, would go far to reconcile those who are
   sincerely concerned for the spiritual character of the church, and for
   the safety of individual souls, to very considerable reductions of
   communion rolls. There cannot be a doubt that, if church discipline
   were upheld with the efficiency and vigor contemplated by Christ, such
   reductions would take place on an extensive scale. It is indeed true
   that the purging process might be carried to excess, and with very
   injurious effects. Tares might be mistaken for wheat, and wheat for
   tares. The church might be turned into a society of Pharisees, thanking
   God that they were not as other men, or as the poor publicans who stood
   without, hearing and praying, but not communicating; while among those
   outside the communion rails might be not only the unworthy, but many
   timid ones who dared not come nigh, but, like the publican of the
   parable, could only stand afar off, crying, "God be merciful to me, a
   sinner," yet all the while were justified rather than the others. A
   system tending to bring about such results is one extreme to be
   avoided. But there is another yet more pernicious extreme still more
   sedulously to be shunned: a careless laxity, which allows sheep and
   goats to be huddled together in one fold, the goats being thereby
   encouraged to deem themselves sheep, and deprived of the greatest
   benefit they can enjoy -- the privilege of being spoken to plainly as
   "unconverted sinners."

   Such unseemly mixtures of the godly and the godless are too common
   phenomena in these days. And the reason is not far to seek. It is not
   indifference to morality, for that is not generally a characteristic of
   the church in our time. It is the desire to multiply members. The
   various religious bodies value members still more than morality or
   high-toned Christian virtue, and they fear lest by discipline they may
   lose one or two names from their communion roll. The fear is not
   without justification. Fugitives from discipline are always sure of an
   open door and a hearty welcome in some quarter. This is one of the many
   curses entailed upon us by that greatest of all scandals, religious
   division. One who has become, or is in danger of becoming, as a heathen
   man and a publican to one ecclesiastical body, has a good chance of
   becoming a saint or an angel in another. Rival churches play at cross
   purposes, one loosing when another binds; so doing their utmost to make
   all spiritual sentences null and void, both in earth and heaven, and to
   rob religion of all dignity and authority. Well may libertines pray
   that the divisions of the church may continue, for while these last
   they fare well! Far otherwise did it fare with the like of them in the
   days when the church was catholic and one; when sinners repenting
   worked their way, in the slow course of years, from the locus lugentium
   outside the sanctuary, through the locus audientium and the locus
   substratorum to the locus fidelium: in that painful manner learning
   what an evil and a bitter thing it is to depart from the living God.
   [337]

   The promise made to consent in prayer [338] comes in appropriately in a
   discourse delivered to disciples who had been disputing who should be
   the greatest. In this connection the promise means: "So long as ye are
   divided by dissensions and jealousies, ye shall be impotent alike with
   men and with God; in your ecclesiastical procedure as church rulers,
   and in your supplications at the throne of grace. But if ye be united
   in mind and heart, ye shall have power with God, and shall prevail: my
   Father will grant your requests, and I myself will be in the midst of
   you."

   It is not necessary to assume any very close connection between this
   promise and the subject of which Jesus had been speaking just before.
   In this familiar discourse transition is made from one topic to another
   in an easy conversational manner, care being taken only that all that
   is said shall be relevant to the general subject in hand. The meeting,
   supposed to be convened in Christ's name, need not therefore be one of
   church officers assembled for the transaction of ecclesiastical
   business: it may be a meeting, in a church or in a cottage, purely for
   the purposes of worship. The promise avails for all persons, all
   subjects of prayer, all places, and all times; for all truly Christian
   assemblies great and small.

   The promise avails for the smallest number that can make a meeting --
   even for two or three. This minimum number is condescended on for the
   purpose of expressing in the strongest possible manner the importance
   of brotherly concord. Jesus gives us to understand that two agreed are
   better, stronger, than twelve or a thousand divided by enmities and
   ambitious passions. "The Lord, when He would commend unanimity and
   peace to His disciples, said, If two of you shall agree on earth,'
   etc., to show that most is granted not to the multitude, but to the
   concord of the supplicants." [339] It is an obvious inference, that if
   by agreement even two be strong, then a multitude really united in mind
   would be proportionally stronger. For we must not fancy that God has
   any partiality for a little meeting, or that there is any virtue in a
   small number. Little strait sects are apt to fall into this mistake,
   and to imagine that Christ had them specially in His eye when He said
   two or three, and that the kind of agreement by which they are
   distinguished -- agreement in whim and crotchet -- is what He
   desiderated. Ridiculous caricature of the Lord's meaning! The agreement
   He requires of His disciples is not entire unanimity in opinion, but
   consent of mind and heart in the ends they aim at, and in unselfish
   devotion to these ends. When He spake of two or three, He did not
   contemplate, as the desirable state of things, the body of His church
   split up into innumerable fragments by religious opinionativeness, each
   fragment in proportion to its minuteness imagining itself sure of His
   presence and blessing. He did not wish His church to consist of a
   collection of clubs having no intercommunion with each other, any more
   than He desired it to be a monster hotel, receiving and harboring all
   comers, no questions being asked. He made the promise now under
   consideration, not to stimulate sectarianism, but to encourage the
   cultivation of virtues which have ever been too rare on earth --
   brotherly-kindness, meekness, charity. The thing He values, in a word,
   is not paucity of numbers, due to the want of charity, but union of
   hearts in lowly love among the greatest number possible.

  SECTION III. FORGIVING INJURIES

    Matt. xviii. 21-35.

   A lesson on forgiveness fitly ended the solemn discourse on humility
   delivered in the hearing of disputatious disciples. The connection of
   thought between beginning and end is very real, though it does not
   quite lie on the surface. A vindictive temper, which is the thing here
   condemned, is one of the vices fostered by an ambitious spirit. An
   ambitious man is sure to be the receiver of many offences, real or
   imaginary. He is quick to take offence, and slow to forgive or forget
   wrong. Forgiving injuries is not in his way: he is more in his element
   when he lays hold of his debtor by the throat, and with ruffian
   fierceness demands payment.

   The concluding part of the discourse was occasioned by a question put
   by Peter, the usual spokesman of the twelve, who came to Jesus and
   said: "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive
   him? till seven times?" By what precise association of ideas the
   question was suggested to Peter's mind we know not; perhaps he did not
   know himself, for the movements of the mind are often mysterious, and
   in impulsive mercurial natures they are also apt to be sudden. Thoughts
   shoot into consciousness like meteors into the upper atmosphere; and
   suddenly conceived, are as abruptly uttered, with physical gestures
   accompanying, indicating the force with which they have taken
   possession of the soul. Suffice it to say, that the disciple's query,
   however suggested, was relevant to the subject in hand, and had latent
   spiritual affinities with all that Jesus had said concerning humility
   and the giving and receiving of offences. It showed on Peter's part an
   intelligent attention to the words of his Master, and a conscientious
   solicitude to conform his conduct to those heavenly precepts by which
   he felt for the moment subdued and softened.

   The question put by Peter further revealed a curious mixture of
   childlikeness and childishness. To be so earnest about the duty of
   forgiving, and even to think of practicing the duty so often as seven
   times towards the same offender, betrayed the true child of the
   kingdom; for none but the graciously-minded are exercised in that
   fashion. But to imagine that pardon repeated just so many times would
   exhaust obligation and amount to something magnanimous and divine, was
   very simple. Poor Peter, in his ingenuous attempt at the magnanimous,
   was like a child standing on tiptoe to make himself as tall as his
   father, or climbing to the top of a hillock to get near the skies.

   The reply of Jesus to His honest but crude disciple was admirably
   adapted to put him out of conceit with himself, and to make him feel
   how puny and petty were the dimensions of his charity. Echoing the
   thought of the prophetic oracle, it tells those who would be like God
   that they must multiply pardons: [340] "I say not unto thee, Until
   seven times; but, Until seventy times seven." Alas for the rarity of
   such charity under the sun! Christ's thoughts are not man's thoughts,
   neither are His ways common among men. As the heavens are higher than
   the earth, so are His thoughts and ways higher than those current in
   this world. For many, far from forgiving times without number a brother
   confessing his fault, do not forgive even so much as once, but act so
   that we can recognize their portrait drawn to the life in the parable
   of the unmerciful servant.

   In this parable, whose minutes details are fraught with instruction,
   three things are specially noteworthy: the contrast between the two
   debts; the corresponding contrast between the two creditors; and the
   doom pronounced on those who, being forgiven the large debt owed by
   them, refuse to forgive the small debt owed to them.

   The two debts are respectively ten thousand talents and a hundred
   denarii, being to each other in the proportion of, say, a million to
   one. The enormous disparity is intended to represent the difference
   between the shortcomings of all men towards God, and those with which
   any man can charge a fellow-creature. The representation is confessed
   to be just by all who know human nature and their own hearts; and the
   consciousness of its truth helps them greatly to be gentle and
   forbearing towards offenders. Yet the parable seems to be faulty in
   this, that it makes the unmerciful servant answerable for such a debt
   as it seems impossible for any man to run up. Who ever heard of a
   private debt amounting in British money to millions sterling? The
   difficulty is met by the suggestion that the debtor is a person of high
   rank, like one of the princes whom Darius set over the kingdom of
   Persia, or a provincial governor of the Roman Empire. Such an official
   might very soon make himself liable for the huge sum here specified,
   simply by retaining for his own benefit the revenues of his province as
   they passed through his hands, instead of remitting them to the royal
   treasury.

   That it was some such unscrupulous minister of state, guilty of the
   crime of embezzlement, whom Jesus had in His eye, appears all but
   certain when we recollect what gave rise to the discourse of which this
   parable forms the conclusion. The disciples had disputed among
   themselves who should be greatest in the kingdom, each one being
   ambitious to obtain the place of distinction for himself. Here,
   accordingly, their Master holds up to their view the conduct of a great
   one, concerned not about the faithful discharge of his duty, but about
   his own aggrandizement. "Behold," He says to them in effect, "what men
   who wish to be great ones do! They rob their king of his revenue, and
   abuse the opportunities afforded by their position to enrich
   themselves; and while scandalously negligent of their own obligations,
   they are characteristically exacting towards any little one who may
   happen in the most innocent way, not by fraud, but by misfortune, to
   have become their debtor."

   Thus understood, the parable faithfully represents the guilt and
   criminality of those at least who are animated by the spirit of pride,
   and deliberately make self-advancement their chief end: a class by no
   means small in number. Such men are great sinners, whoever may be
   little ones. They not merely come short of the glory of God, the true
   chief end of man, but they deliberately rob the Supreme of His due,
   calling in question His sovereignty, denying their accountability to
   Him for their actions, and by the spirit which animates them, saying
   every moment of their lives, "Who is Lord over us?" It is impossible to
   over-estimate the magnitude of their guilt.

   The contrast between the two creditors is not less striking than that
   between the two debts. The king forgives the enormous debt of his
   unprincipled sat rap on receiving a simple promise to pay; the forgiven
   sat rap relentlessly exacts the petty debt of some three pounds
   sterling from the poor hapless underling who owes it, stopping his ear
   to the identical petition for delay which he had himself successfully
   presented to his sovereign lord. Here also the coloring of the parable
   appears too strong. The great creditor seems lenient to excess: for
   surely such a crime as the sat rap had been guilty of ought not to go
   unpunished; and surely it had been wise to attach little weight to a
   promise of future payment made by a man who, with unbounded
   extravagance, had already squandered such a prodigious sum, so that he
   had nothing to pay! Then this great debtor, in his character as small
   creditor, seems incredibly inhuman; for even the meanest, most greedy,
   and grasping churl, not to speak of so great a gentleman, might well be
   ashamed to show such eagerness about so trifling a sum as to seize the
   poor wight who owed it by the throat and drag him to prison, to lie
   there till he paid it.

   The representation is doubtless extreme, and yet in both parts it is in
   accordance with truth. God does deal with His debtors as the king dealt
   with the sat rap. He is slow to anger, and of great kindness, and
   repenteth Him of the evil He hath threatened. He giveth men space to
   repent, and by providential delays accepts promises of amendment,
   though He knoweth full well that they will be broken, and that those
   who made them will go on sinning as before. So He dealt with Pharaoh,
   with Israel, with Nineveh; so He deals with all whom He calls to
   account by remorse of conscience, by a visitation of sickness, or by
   the apprehension of death, when, on their exclaiming, in a passing
   penitential mood, "Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay Thee
   all," He grants their petition, knowing that when the danger or the fit
   of repentance is over, the promise of amendment will be utterly
   forgotten. Truly was it written of old: "He hath not dealt with us
   after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities."

   Nor is the part played by the unmerciful servant, however infamous and
   inhuman, altogether unexampled; although its comparative rarity is
   implied in that part of the parabolic story which represents the
   fellow-servants of the relentless one as shocked and grieved at his
   conduct, and as reporting it to the common master. It would not be
   impossible to find originals of the dark picture, even among professors
   of the Christian religion, who believe in the forgiveness of sins
   through the blood of Jesus, and hope to experience all the benefits of
   divine mercy for His sake. It is, indeed, precisely by such persons
   that the crime of unmercifulness is, in the parable, supposed to be
   committed. The exacting creditor meets his debtor just as he himself
   comes out from the presence of the king after craving and receiving
   remission of his own debt. This feature in the story at once adapts its
   lesson specially to believers in the gospel, and points out the
   enormity of their guilt. All such, if not really forgiven, do at least
   consciously live under a reign of grace, in which God is assuming the
   attitude of one who desires all to be reconciled unto Himself, and for
   that end proclaims a gratuitous pardon to all who will receive it. In
   men so situated the spirit of unmercifulness is peculiarly offensive.
   Shameful in a pagan, -- for the light of nature teacheth the duty of
   being merciful, -- such inhuman rigor as is here portrayed in a
   Christian is utterly abominable. Think of it! he goes out from the
   presence of the King of grace; rises up from the perusal of the blessed
   gospel, which tells of One who received publicans and sinners, even the
   chief; walks forth from the house of prayer where the precious evangel
   is proclaimed, yea, from the communion table, which commemorates the
   love that moved the Son of God to pay the debt of sinners; and he meets
   a fellow-mortal who has done him some petty wrong, and seizes him by
   the throat, and truculently demands reparation on pain of imprisonment
   or something worse if it be not forthcoming May not the most gracious
   Lord righteously say to such an one: "O thou wicked servant! I forgave
   thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me; shouldest thou not also
   have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?"
   What can the miscreant who showed no mercy expect, but to receive
   judgment without mercy, and to be delivered over to the tormentors, to
   be kept in durance and put to the rack, without hope of release, till
   he shall have paid his debt to the uttermost farthing?

   This very doom Jesus, in the closing sentences of His discourse,
   solemnly assured His disciples awaited all who cherish an unforgiving
   temper, even if they themselves should be the guilty parties. "So
   likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you if ye from your
   hearts forgive not every one his brother." [341] Stern words these,
   which lay down a rule of universal application, not relaxable in the
   case of favored parties. Were partiality admissible at all, such as the
   twelve would surely get the benefit of it; but as if to intimate that
   in this matter there is no respect of persons, the law is enunciated
   with direct, emphatic reference to them. And harsh as the law might
   seem, Jesus is careful to indicate His cordial approval of its being
   enforced with Rhadamanthine rigor. For that purpose He calls God the
   Judge by the endearing name "My heavenly Father;." as if to say: "The
   great God and King does not seem to me unduly stern in decreeing such
   penalties against the unforgiving. I, the merciful, tender-hearted Son
   of man, thoroughly sympathize with such judicial severity. I should
   solemnly say Amen to that doom pronounced even against you if you
   behaved so as to deserve it. Think not that because ye are my chosen
   companions, therefore violations of the law of love by you will be
   winked at. On the contrary, just because ye are great ones in the
   kingdom, so far as privilege goes, will compliance with its fundamental
   laws be especially expected of you, and non-compliance most severely
   punished. To whom much is given, of him shall much be required. See,
   then, that ye forgive every one his brother their trespasses, and that
   ye do so really, not in pretense, even from your very hearts." By such
   severe plainness of speech did Jesus educate His disciples for being
   truly great ones in His kingdom: great not in pride, pretension, and
   presumption, but in loyal obedience to the behests of their King, and
   particularly to this law of forgiveness, on which He insisted in His
   teaching so earnestly and so frequently. [342] And we cannot but remark
   here, at the close of our exposition of the discourse on humility, that
   if the apostles in after days did not rise superior to petty passions,
   it was not the fault of their Master in neglecting their training.
   "With holy earnestness," -- to quote the language of a German scholar,
   -- " springing equally out of solicitude for the new community, zeal
   for the cause of God and of men; nay, for the essential truths of the
   new religion of divine grace and of the brotherhood of mankind, Jesus
   sought to ward off the dark shadow of petty, ungodly feelings which He
   saw creeping stealthily into the circle of His disciples, and of whose
   still more extensive and mischievous influence, after His departure, He
   could not but be apprehensive." [343] We cannot believe that all this
   earnestness had been manifested in vain; that the disciples did not at
   length get the salt thoroughly into them. [344]

   [344] Mark ix. 49, 50. This passage, peculiar to Mark, and forming
   without doubt a most authentic part of the discourse on humility, is
   difficult to interpret. But while we may hesitate as to the precise
   exposition, we can have little difficulty in getting at the leading
   thoughts contained. They are these three: -- 1. The necessity of a more
   or less painful process of purification in order to salvation. 2. The
   need of constant care lest the salt of grace, already possessed, become
   insipid. 3. The wholesome influence of the salt of grace when it hath
   not lost its savor in maintaining a state of mutual concord among
   Christians. The first thought is expressed by the words, "Every one
   shall be salted with fire," the form of expression being naturally
   determined by the previous reference to hell fire. The meaning is, put
   yourselves through a purgatorial fire, that ye may escape the fire that
   is penal. A fire salting of some kind is inevitable: choose the one
   that is saving. The third of the above thoughts is expressed in the
   words, "Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other." The
   salt meant is that of a severe self-discipline that wrestles with the
   evil passion in the heart, and resolutely lops off every member that
   offendeth. Where this salt is, all occasion for quarrelling arising out
   of ambitious, vain, self-willed thoughts and desires is taken away.

  SECTION IV. THE TEMPLE TAX: AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SERMON

    Matt. xvii. 24-27.

   This story is a nut with a dry, hard shell, but a very sweet kernel.
   Superficial readers may see in it nothing more than a curious anecdote
   of a singular fish with a piece of money in its mouth turning up
   opportunely to pay a tax, related by Matthew, alone of the evangelists,
   not because of its intrinsic importance, but simply because, being an
   ex-tax gatherer, he took kindly to the tale. Devout readers, though
   unwilling to acknowledge it, may be secretly scandalized by the miracle
   related, as not merely a departure from the rule which Jesus observed
   of not using His divine power to help Himself, but as something very
   like a piece of sport on His part, or an expression of a humorous sense
   of incongruity, reminding one of the grotesque figures in old
   cathedrals, in the carving of which the builders delighted to show
   their skill, and find for themselves amusement.

   Breaking the shell of the story, we discover within, as its kernel, a
   most pathetic exhibition of the humiliation and self-humiliation of the
   Son of man, who appears exposed to the indignity of being dunned for
   temple dues, and so oppressed with poverty that He cannot pay the sum
   demanded, though its amount is only fifteenpence; yet neither pleading
   poverty nor insisting on exemption on the score of privilege, but
   quietly meeting the claims of the collectors in a manner which, if
   sufficiently strange, as we admit, [345] was at all events singularly
   meek and peaceable.

   The present incident supplies, in truth, an admirable illustration of
   the doctrine taught in the discourse on humility. The greatest in the
   kingdom here exemplifies by anticipation the lowliness He inculcated on
   His disciples, and shows them in exercise a holy, loving solicitude to
   avoid giving offence not only to the little ones within the kingdom,
   but even to those without. He stands not on His dignity as the Son of
   God, though the voice from heaven uttered on the holy mount still rings
   in His ears, but consents to be treated as a subject or a stranger;
   desiring to live peaceably with men whose ways He does not love, and
   who bear Him no good-will, by complying with their wishes in all things
   lawful. We regard, in short, this curious scene at Capernaum (with the
   Mount of Transfiguration in the distant background!) as a historical
   frontispiece to the sermon we have been studying. We think ourselves
   justified in taking this view of it, by the consideration that, though
   the scene occurred before the sermon was delivered, it happened after
   the dispute which supplied the preacher with a text. The disciples fell
   to disputing on the way home from the Mount of Transfiguration, while
   the visit of the tax-gatherers took place on their arrival in
   Capernaum. Of course Jesus knew of the dispute at the time of the
   visit, though He had not yet expressly adverted to it. Is it too much
   to assume that His knowledge of what had been going on by the way
   influenced His conduct in the affair of the tribute money, and led Him
   to make it the occasion for teaching by action the same lesson which He
   meant to take an early opportunity of inculcating by words? [346]

   This assumption, so far from being unwarranted, is, we believe, quite
   necessary in order to make Christ's conduct on this occasion
   intelligible. Those who leave out of account the dispute by the way are
   not at the right point of view for seeing the incident at Capernaum in
   its natural light, and they fall inevitably into misunderstandings.
   They are forced, e.g., to regard Jesus as arguing seriously against
   payment of the temple tax, as something not legally obligatory, or as
   lying out of the ordinary course of His humiliation as the Son of man.
   Now it was neither one nor other of these things. The law of Moses
   ordained that every man above twenty years should pay the sum of half a
   shekel as an atonement for his soul, and to meet the expenses connected
   with the service of the tabernacle rendered to God for the common
   benefit of all Israelites; and Jesus, as a Jew, was just as much under
   obligation to comply with this particular law as with any other. Nor
   was there any peculiar indignity, either in kind or degree, involved in
   obeying that law. Doubtless it was a great indignity and humiliation to
   the Son of God to be paying taxes for the maintenance of His own
   Father's house! All that He said to Peter, pointing out the incongruity
   of such a state of things, was sober truth. But the incongruity does
   not meet us here alone; it runs through the whole of our Lord's earthly
   experience. His life, in all respects, departed from the analogy of
   kings' sons. Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience; though He
   were a Son, yet came He not to be ministered unto, but to minister;
   though He were a Son, yet became He subject to the law, not merely the
   moral but the ceremonial, and was circumcised, and took part in the
   temple worship, and frequented the sacred feasts, and offered
   sacrifices, though these were all only shadows of good things, whereof
   He Himself was the substance. Surely, in a life containing so many
   indignities and incongruities, -- which was, in fact, one grand
   indignity from beginning to end, -- it was a small matter to be obliged
   to pay annually, for the benefit of the temple, the paltry sum of
   fifteenpence! He who with marvelous patience went through all the rest,
   could not possibly mean to stumble and scruple at so trifling a matter.
   He who did nothing towards destroying the temple and putting an end to
   legal worship before the time, could not be a party to the mean policy
   of starving out its officials, or grudging the funds necessary to keep
   the sacred edifice in good repair. He might say openly what He thought
   of existing ecclesiastical abuses, but He would do no more.

   The truth is, that the words spoken by Jesus to Simon were not intended
   as an argument against paying the tax, but as an explanation of what
   was meant by His paying it, and of the motive which guided Him in
   paying it. They were a lesson for Simon, and through him for the
   twelve, on a subject wherein they had great need of instruction; not a
   legal defense against the demands of the tax-gatherer. But for that
   dispute by the way, Jesus would probably have taken the quietest means
   for getting the tax paid, as a matter of course, without making any
   remarks on the subject. That He had already acted thus on previous
   occasions, Peter's prompt affirmative reply to the question of the
   collectors seems to imply. The disciple said "yes," as knowing what his
   Master had done in past years, and assuming as a thing of course that
   His practice would be the same now. But Jesus did not deem it, in
   present circumstances, expedient to let His disciples regard His action
   with respect to the tax as a mere vulgar matter of course; He wanted
   them to understand and reflect on the moral meaning and the motive of
   His action for their own instruction and guidance.

   He wished them to understand, in the first place, that for Him to pay
   the temple dues was a humiliation and an incongruity, similar to that
   of a king's son paying a tax for the support of the palace and the
   royal household; that it was not a thing of course that He should pay,
   any more than it was a thing of course that He should become man, and,
   so to speak, leave His royal state behind and assume the rank of a
   peasant; that it was an act of voluntary humiliation, forming one item
   in the course of humiliation to which He voluntarily submitted,
   beginning with His birth, and ending with His death and burial. He
   desired His disciples to think of these things in the hope that
   meditation on them would help to rebuke the pride, pretension, and
   self-assertion which had given rise to that petty dispute about places
   of distinction. He would say to them, in effect: "Were I, like you,
   covetous of honors, and bent on asserting my importance, I would stand
   on my dignity, and haughtily reply to these collectors of tribute: Why
   trouble ye me about temple dues? Know ye not who I am? I am the Christ,
   the Son of the living God: the temple is my Father's house; and I, His
   Son, am free from all servile obligations. But, note ye well, I do
   nothing of the kind. With the honors heaped upon me on the Mount of
   Transfiguration fresh in my recollection, with the consciousness of who
   I am, and whence I came, and whither I go, abiding deep in my soul, I
   submit to be treated as a mere common Jew, suffering my honors to fall
   into abeyance, and making no demands for a recognition which is not
   voluntarily conceded. The world knows me not; and while it knows me
   not, I am content that it should do with me, as with John, whatsoever
   it lists. Did the rulers know who I am, they would be ashamed to ask of
   me temple dues; but since they do not, I accept and bear all the
   indignities consequent on their ignorance."

   All this Jesus said in effect to His disciples, by first adverting to
   the grounds on which a refusal to pay the didrachmon might plausibly be
   defended, and then after all paying it. The manner of payment also was
   so contrived by Him as to re-enforce the lesson. He said not to Simon
   simply: "Go and catch fish, that with the proceeds of their sale we may
   satisfy our creditors." He gave him directions as the Lord of nature,
   to whom all creatures in land or sea were subject, and all their
   movements familiar, while yet so humbled as to need the services of the
   meanest of them. By drawing on His omniscience in giving these
   instructions to His disciple, He did, in a manner, what He never did
   either before or after, viz. wrought a miracle for His own behoof. The
   exception, however, had the same reason as the rule, and therefore
   proved the rule. Jesus abstained from using His divine faculties for
   His own benefit, that He might not impair the integrity of His
   humiliation; that His human life might be a real bona fide life of
   hardship, unalleviated by the presence of the divine element in His
   personality. But what was the effect of the lightning-flash of divine
   knowledge emitted by Him in giving those directions to Peter? To impair
   the integrity of His humiliation? Nay, but only to make it glaringly
   conspicuous. It said to Simon, and to us, if he and we had ears to
   hear: "Behold who it is that pays this tax, and that is reduced to such
   straits in order to pay it! It is He who knoweth all the fowls of the
   mountain, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea!"

   The other point on which Jesus desired to fix the attention of His
   disciples, was the reason which moved Him to adopt the policy of
   submission to what was in itself an indignity. That reason was to avoid
   giving offence: "Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them." This was
   not, of course, the only reason of His conduct in this case. There were
   other comprehensive reasons applicable to His whole experience of
   humiliation, and to this small item therein in particular; a full
   account of which would just amount to an answer to the great question
   put by Anselm: "Cur Deus Homo; "Why did God become man? On that great
   question we do not enter here, however, but confine ourselves to the
   remark, that while the reason assigned by Jesus to Peter for the
   payment of the temple dues was by no means the only one, or even the
   chief, it was the reason to which, for the disciples' sake, He deemed
   it expedient just then to give prominence. He was about to discourse to
   them largely on the subject of giving and receiving offences; and He
   wished them, and specially their foremost man, first of all to observe
   how very careful He Himself was not to offend, -- what a prominent
   place the desire to avoid giving offence occupied among His motives.

   Christ's declared reason for paying the tribute is strikingly
   expressive of His lowliness and His love. The mark of His lowliness is
   that there is no word here of taking offence. How easily and plausibly
   might He have taken up the position of one who did well to be angry! "I
   am the Christ, the Son of God," He might have said, "and have
   substantiated my claims by a thousand miracles in word and deed, yet
   they willfully refuse to recognize me; I am a poor homeless wanderer,
   yet they, knowing this, demanded the tribute, as if more for the sake
   of annoying and insulting me than of getting the money. And for what
   purpose do they collect these dues? For the support of a religious
   establishment thoroughly effete, to repair an edifice doomed to
   destruction, to maintain a priesthood scandalously deficient in the
   cardinal virtues of integrity and truth, and whose very existence is a
   curse to the land. I cannot in conscience pay a didrachmon, no, not
   even so much as a farthing, for any such objects."

   The lowly One did not assume this attitude, but gave what was asked
   without complaint, grudging, or railing; and His conduct conveys a
   lesson for Christians in all ages, and in our own age in particular. It
   teaches the children of the kingdom not to murmur because the world
   does not recognize their status and dignity. The world knew not when He
   came, even God's eternal Son; what wonder if it recognize not His
   younger brethren! The kingdom of heaven itself is not believed in, and
   its citizens should not be surprised at any want of respect towards
   them individually. The manifestation of the sons of God is one of the
   things for which Christians wait in hope. For the present they are not
   the children, but the strangers: instead of exemption from burdens,
   they should rather expect oppression; and they should be thankful when
   they are put on a level with their fellow-creatures, and get the
   benefit of a law of toleration.

   As the humility of Jesus was shown by His not taking, so His love was
   manifested by His solicitude to avoid giving offence. He desired, if
   possible, to conciliate persons who for the most part had treated Him
   all along as a heathen and a publican, and who ere long, as He knew
   well, would treat Him even as a felon. How like Himself was the Son of
   man in so acting! How thoroughly in keeping His procedure here with His
   whole conduct while He was on the earth! For what was His aim in coming
   to the world, what His constant endeavor after He came, but to cancel
   offences, and to put an end to enmities -- to reconcile sinful men to
   God and to each other? For these ends He took flesh; for these ends He
   was crucified. His earthly life was all of a piece -- a life of lowly
   love.

   "Lest we should offend," said Jesus, using the plural to hint that He
   meant His conduct to be imitated by the twelve and by all His
   followers. How happy for the world and the church were this done! How
   many offences might have been prevented had the conciliatory spirit of
   the Lord always animated those called by His name! How many offences
   might be removed were this spirit abundantly poured out on Christians
   of all denominations now! Did this motive, "Notwithstanding, lest we
   should offend," bulk largely in all minds, what breaches might be
   healed, what unions might come! A national church morally, if not
   legally, established in unity and peace, might be realized in Scotland
   in the present generation. Surely a consummation devoutly to be wished!
   Let us wish for it; let us pray for it; let us cherish a spirit tending
   to make it possible; let us hope for it against hope, in spite of
   increasing tendencies on all sides to indulge in an opposite spirit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [345] Jesus, we believe, did work miracles expressive of humor, not
   however in levity, but in holy earnest. Such were the cursing of the
   fig-tree; the healing of blindness by putting clay on the eyes, as a
   satire on the blind guides; and the present one, expressing a sense of
   the incongruity between the outward condition and the intrinsic dignity
   of the Son of God. But Dr. Farrar doubts whether a miracle was wrought
   at all. He thinks the translation of our Lord's words concerning the
   fish might run, "On opening its mouth thou shalt get or obtain a
   stater;" such a use of the verb heurisko being quite classical; and
   suggests the possibility of some essential particular having been
   omitted or left unexplained. -- The Life of Christ, ii. 46.

   [346] We invite the special attention of our readers to the above
   indicated connection, as for want of insight into the connection the
   incident now under consideration has received very scant justice.
   WeizsÃ¤cker, e.g., no extreme critic, holds that the incident in
   question has no connection with the group of incidents amid which it
   occurs, and says Matthew, brings it in here because it happened at
   Capernaum, because he could not get it in sooner, and must put it here
   or leave it out altogether. -- Vide Untersuchunger Ã¼ber die

  SECTION V. THE INTERDICTED EXORCIST: ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION

    Mark ix. 38-41; Luke ix. 49, 50.

   The discourses of our Lord were not continuous, unbroken addresses on
   formally announced themes, such as we are wont to hear, but rather for
   the most part of the nature of Socratic dialogues, in which He was the
   principal speaker, His disciples contributing their part in the form of
   a question asked, an exclamation uttered, or a case of conscience
   propounded. In the discourse or dialogue on humility, two of the
   disciples acted as interlocutors, viz. Peter and John. Towards the
   close the former of these two disciples, as we saw, asked a question
   concerning the forgiving of injuries; and near the commencement the
   other disciple, John, related an anecdote which was brought up to his
   recollection by the doctrine of his Master, respecting receiving little
   ones in His name, and on which the truth therein set forth seemed to
   have a bearing. The facts thus brought under his notice led Jesus to
   make reflections, which supply an interesting illustration of the
   bearing of the doctrine He was inculcating on a particular class of
   cases or questions. These reflections, with the incident to which they
   relate, now solicit attention.

   The story told by John was to the effect that on one occasion he and
   his brethren had found a man unknown to them engaged in the work of
   casting out devils, and had served him with an interdict, because,
   though he used the name of Jesus in practicing exorcism, he did not
   follow or identify himself with them, the twelve. At what particular
   time this happened is not stated; but it may be conjectured with much
   probability that the incident was a reminiscence of the Galilean
   mission, during which the disciples were separated from their Master,
   and were themselves occupied in healing the sick, and casting out evil
   spirits, and in preaching the gospel of the kingdom.

   John, it will be observed, does not disclaim joint responsibility for
   the high-handed proceeding he relates, but speaks as if the twelve had
   acted unanimously in the matter. It may surprise some to find him, the
   apostle of love, [347] consenting to so uncharitable a deed; but such
   surprise is founded on superficial views of his character, as well as
   on ignorance of the laws of spiritual growth. John is not now what he
   will be, but differs from his future self, as much as an orange in its
   second year differs from the same orange in its third final year of
   growth. The fruit of the Spirit will ultimately ripen in this disciple
   into something very sweet and beautiful; but meantime it is green,
   bitter, and fit only to set the teeth on edge. Devoted in mind, tender
   and intense in his attachment to Jesus, scrupulously conscientious in
   all his actions, he is even now; but he is also bigoted, intolerant,
   ambitious. Already he has played the part of a very high churchman in
   suppressing the nonconforming exorcist; ere long we shall see him
   figuring, together with his brother, as a persecutor, proposing to call
   down fire from heaven to destroy the enemies of his Lord; and yet again
   we shall find him, along with the same brother and their common mother,
   engaged in an ambitious plot to secure those places of distinction in
   the kingdom about which all the twelve have lately been wrangling.

   In refusing to recognize the exorcist fellow-worker, however humble, as
   a brother, the disciples proceeded on very narrow and precarious
   grounds. The test they applied was purely external. What sort of man
   the person interdicted might be they did not inquire; it was enough
   that he was not of their company: as if all inside that charmed circle
   -- Judas, for example -- were good; and all outside, not excepting a
   Nicodemus, utterly Christless! Two good things, on their own showing,
   could be said of him whom they silenced: he was well occupied, and he
   seemed to have a most devout regard for Jesus; for he cast out devils,
   and he did it in Jesus' name. These were not indeed decisive marks of
   discipleship, for it was possible that a man might practice exorcism
   for gain, and use the name of Christ because it had been proved to be a
   good name to conjure by; but they ought to have been regarded as at
   least presumptive evidence in favor of one in whose conduct they
   appeared. Judging by the facts, it was probable that the silenced
   exorcist was an honest and sincere man, whose heart had been impressed
   by the ministry of Jesus and His disciples, and who desired to imitate
   their zeal in doing good. It was even possible that he was more than
   this -- a man possessing higher spiritual endowment than his censors,
   some provincial prophet as yet unknown to fame. How preposterous, in
   view of such a possibility, that narrow outward test, "Not with us "!

   As an illustration of what this way of judging lands in, one little
   fact in the history of the celebrated Sir Matthew Hale, whose
   Contemplations are familiar to all readers of devout literature, may
   here be introduced. Richard Baxter relates that the good people in the
   part of the country where the distinguished judge resided, after his
   retirement from the judicial bench, did not entertain a favorable
   opinion of his religious character, their notion being that he was
   certainly a very moral man, but not converted. It was a serious
   conclusion to come to about a fellow-creature, and one is curious to
   know on what so solemn a judgment was based. The author of the Saint's
   Rest gives us the needful information on this momentous point. The
   pious folks about Acton, he tells us, ranked the ex-judge among the
   unconverted, because he did not frequent their private weekly
   prayer-meetings! It was the old story of the twelve and the exorcist
   under a new Puritanic form. Baxter, it is needless to say, did not
   sympathize with the harsh, uncharitable opinion of his less enlightened
   brethren. His thoughts breathed the gentle, benignant, humble,
   charitable spirit of Christian maturity. "I," he adds, after relating
   the fact above stated, "I that have heard and read his serious
   expressions of the concernments of eternity, and seen his love to all
   good men, and the blamelessness of his life, thought better of his
   piety than of mine own." [348]

   In silencing the exorcist the twelve were probably actuated by a
   mixture of motives -- partly by jealousy, and partly by conscientious
   scruples. They disliked, we imagine, the idea of any one using Christ's
   name but themselves, desiring a monopoly of the power conferred by that
   name to cast out evil spirits; and they probably thought it unlikely,
   if not impossible, that any one who kept aloof from them could be
   sincerely devoted to their Master.

   In so far as the disciples acted under the influence of jealousy, their
   conduct towards the exorcist was morally of a piece with their recent
   dispute who should be the greatest. The same spirit of pride revealed
   itself on the two occasions under different phases. The silencing of
   the exorcist was a display of arrogance analogous to that of those who
   advance for their church the claim to be exclusively the church of
   Christ. In their dispute among themselves, the disciples played on a
   humble scale the game of ambitious, self-seeking ecclesiastics
   contending for seats of honor and power. In the one case the twelve
   said in effect to the man whom they found casting out devils: We are
   the sole commissioned, authorized agents of the Lord Jesus Christ; in
   the other case they said to each other: We are all members of the
   kingdom and servants of the King; but I deserve to have a higher place
   than thou, even to be a prelate sitting on a throne.

   In so far as the intolerance of the twelve was due to honest
   scrupulosity, it is deserving of more respectful consideration. The
   plea of conscience, honestly advanced, must always be listened to with
   serious attention, even when it is mistaken. We say "honestly" with
   emphasis, because we cannot forget that there is much scrupulosity that
   is not honest. Conscience is often used as a stalking-horse by proud,
   quarrelsome, self-willed men to promote their own private ends. Pride,
   says one, speaking of doctrinal disputes, "is the greatest enemy of
   moderation. This makes men stickle for their opinions to make them
   fundamental. Proud men, having deeply studied some additional point in
   divinity, will strive to make the same necessary to salvation, to
   enhance the value of their own worth and pains; and it must needs be
   fundamental in religion, because it is fundamental to their
   reputation." [349] These shrewd remarks hold good of other things
   besides doctrine. Opinionative, pragmatic persons, would make every
   thing in religion fundamental on which they have decided views; and if
   they could get their own way, they would exclude from the church all
   who held not with them in the very minutiae of belief and practice. But
   there is such a thing also as honest scrupulosity, and it is more
   common than many imagine. There is a certain tendency to intolerant
   exaction, and to severity in judging, in the unripe stage of every
   earnest life. For the conscience of a young disciple is like a fire of
   green logs, which smokes first before it burns with a clear blaze. And
   a Christian whose conscience is in this state must be treated as we
   treat a dull fire: he must be borne with, that is, till his conscience
   clear itself of bitter, cloudy smoke, and become a pure, genial, warm
   flame of zeal tempered by charity.

   That the scrupulosity of the twelve was of the honest kind, we believe
   for this reason, that they were willing to be instructed. They told
   their Master what they had done, that they might learn from Him whether
   it was right or wrong This is not the way of men whose plea of
   conscience is a pretext.

   The instruction honestly desired by the disciples, Jesus promptly
   communicated in the form of a clear, definite judgment on the case,
   with a reason annexed. "Forbid him not," He replied to John, "for he
   that is not against us is for us." [350]

   The reason assigned for this counsel of tolerance reminds us of another
   maxim uttered by Jesus on the occasion when the Pharisees brought
   against Him the blasphemous charge of casting out devils by aid of
   Beelzebub. [351] The two sayings have a superficial aspect of
   contradiction: one seeming to say, The great matter is not to be
   decidedly against; the other, The great matter is to be decidedly for.
   But they are harmonized by a truth underlying both -- that the cardinal
   matter in spiritual character is the bias of the heart. Here Jesus
   says: "If the heart of a man be with me, then, though by ignorance,
   error, isolation from those who are avowedly my friends, he may seem to
   be against me, he is really for me." In the other case He meant to say:
   "If a man be not in heart with me (the case of the Pharisees), then,
   though by his orthodoxy and his zeal he may seem to be on God's side,
   and therefore on mine, he is in reality against me."

   To the words just commented on, Mark adds the following, as spoken by
   Jesus at this time: "There is no man that shall do a miracle in my name
   that can lightly speak evil of me." The voice of wisdom and charity
   united is audible here. The emphasis is on the word tachu, lightly or
   readily. This word, in the first place, involves the admission that the
   case supposed might happen; an admission demanded by historical truth,
   for such cases did actually occur in after days. Luke tells, e.g., of
   certain vagabond Jews (in every sense well named) who took upon them to
   call over demoniac the name of the Lord Jesus, without any personal
   faith in Him, but simply in the way of trade, being vile traffickers in
   exorcism for whom even the devils expressed their contempt, exclaiming,
   "Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye?" [352] Our Lord knowing
   before that such cases would happen, and being acquainted with the
   depths of human depravity, could not do otherwise than admit the
   possibility of the exorcist referred to by John being animated by
   unworthy motives. But while making the admission, He took care to
   indicate that, in His judgment, the case supposed was very improbable,
   and that it was very unlikely that one who did a miracle in His name
   would speak evil of Him. And He desired His disciples to be on their
   guard against readily and lightly believing that any man could be
   guilty of such a sin. Till strong reasons for thinking otherwise
   appeared, He would have them charitably regard the outward action as
   the index of sincere faith and love (which they might the more easily
   do then, when nothing was to be gained by the use or profession of
   Christ's name, but the displeasure of those who had the characters and
   lives of men in their power).

   Such were the wise, gracious words spoken by Jesus with reference to
   the case brought up for judgment by John. Is it possible to extract any
   lessons from these words of general application to the church in all
   ages, or specially applicable to our own age in particular? It is a
   question on which one must speak with diffidence; for while all bow to
   the judgment of Jesus on the conduct of His disciples, as recorded in
   the Gospels, there is much difference among Christians as to the
   inferences to be drawn therefrom, in reference to cases in which their
   own conduct is concerned. The following reflections, may, however,
   safely be hazarded: --

   1. We may learn from the discreet, loving words of the great Teacher to
   beware of hasty conclusions concerning men's spiritual state based on
   merely external indications. Say not with the Church of Rome, "Out of
   our communion is no possibility of salvation or of goodness;." but
   rather admit that even in that corrupt communion may be many building
   on the true foundation, though, for the most part, with very
   combustible materials; nay, that Christ may have not a few friends
   outside the pale of all the churches. Ask not with Nathanael, "Can any
   good thing come out of Nazareth?" but remember that the best things may
   come out of most unexpected quarters. Be not forgetful to entertain
   strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Bear in
   mind that, by indulging in the cry, "Not with us," in reference to
   trifles and crotchets, you may tempt God, while giving His Holy Spirit
   to those whom you unchurch, to withdraw His influences from you for
   your pride, exclusiveness, and self-will, and may turn your creed into
   a prison, in which you shall be shut out from the fellowship of saints,
   and doomed to experience the chagrin of seeing through the window-bars
   of your cell God's people walking at large, while you lie immured in a
   jail.

   2. In view of that verdict, "Forbid him not," one must read with a sad,
   sorrowful heart, many pages of church history, in which the
   predominating spirit is that of the twelve rather than that of their
   Master. One may confidently say, that had Christ's mind dwelt more in
   those called by His name, many things in that history would have been
   different. Separatism, censoriousness, intolerance of nonconformity,
   persecution, would not have been so rife; Conventicle Acts and
   Five-mile Acts would not have disgraced the statute-book of the English
   Parliament; Bedford jail would not have had the honor of receiving the
   illustrious dreamer of the Pilgrim's Progress as a prisoner; Baxter,
   and Livingstone of Ancrum, and thousands more like-minded, by whose
   stirring words multitudes had been quickened to a new spiritual life,
   would not have been driven from their parishes and their native lands,
   and forbidden under heavy penalties to preach that gospel they
   understood and loved so well, but would have enjoyed the benefit of
   that law of toleration which they purchased so dearly for us, their
   children.

   3. The divided state of the church has ever been a cause of grief to
   good men, and attempts have been made to remedy the evil by schemes of
   union. All honest endeavors having in view the healing of breaches,
   which, since the days of the Reformation, have multiplied so greatly as
   to be the opprobrium of Protestantism, deserve our warmest sympathies
   and most earnest prayers. But we cannot be blind to the fact that
   through human infirmity such projects are apt to miscarry; it being
   extremely difficult to get a whole community, embracing men of
   different temperaments and in different stages of Christian growth, to
   take the same view of the terms of fellowship. What, then, is the duty
   of Christians meanwhile? We may learn from our Lord's judgment in the
   case of the exorcist. If those who are not of our company cannot be
   brought to enter into the same ecclesiastical organization, let us
   still recognize them from the heart as fellow-disciples and
   fellow-laborers, and avail ourselves of all lawful or open ways of
   showing that we care infinitely more for those who truly love Christ,
   in whatever church they be, than for those who are with us
   ecclesiastically, but in spirit and life are not with Christ, but
   against Him. So shall we have the comfort of feeling that, though
   separated from brethren beloved, we are not schismatical, and be able
   to speak of the divided state of the church as a thing that we desire
   not, but merely endure because we cannot help it.

   Many religious people are at fault here. There are Christians not a few
   who do not believe in these two articles of the Apostles' Creed, "the
   holy catholic church" and "the communion of saints." They care little
   or nothing for those who are outside the pale of their own communion:
   they practice brotherly-kindness most exemplarily, but they have no
   charity. Their church is their club, in which they enjoy the comfort of
   associating with a select number of persons, whose opinions, whims,
   hobbies, and ecclesiastical politics entirely agree with their own;
   every thing beyond in the wide wide world being regarded with cold
   indifference, if not with passionate aversion or abhorrence. It is one
   of the many ways in which the spirit of religious legalism, so
   prevalent amongst us, reveals itself. The spirit of adoption is a
   catholic spirit. The legal spirit is a dividing, sectarian spirit,
   multiplying fundamentals, and erecting scruples into principles, and so
   manufacturing evermore new religious sects or clubs. Now a club,
   ecclesiastical or other, is a very pleasant thing by way of a luxury;
   but it ought to be remembered that, besides the club, and including all
   the clubs, there is the great Christian commonwealth. This fact will
   have to be more recognized than it has been if church life is not to
   become a mere imbecility. To save us from this doom one of two things
   must take place. Either religious people must overcome their doting
   fondness for the mere club fellowship of denominationalism, involving
   absolute uniformity in opinion and practice; or a sort of Amphictyonic
   council must be set on foot as a counterpoise to sectarianism, in which
   all the sects shall find a common meeting-place for the discussion of
   great catholic questions bearing on morals, missions, education, and
   the defense of cardinal truths. Such a council (utopian it will be
   deemed) would have many open questions in its constitution. In the
   ancient Amphictyonic council men were not known as Athenians or
   Spartans, but as Greeks; and in our modern utopian one men would be
   known only as Christians, not as Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
   Independents, Churchmen, and Dissenters. It would be such a body, in
   fact, as the "Evangelical Alliance" of recent origin, created by the
   craving for some visible expression of the feeling of catholicity; but
   not, like it, amateur, self-constituted, and patronized (to a certain
   extent) by persons alienated from all existing ecclesiastical
   organizations, and disposed to substitute it as a new church in their
   place, but consisting of representatives belonging to, and regularly
   elected and empowered by, the different sections of the church. [353]

   One remark more we make on this club theory of church fellowship.
   Worked out, it secures at least one object. It breaks Christians up
   into small companies, and insures that they shall meet in twos and
   threes! Unhappily, it does not at the same time procure the blessing
   promised to the two or three. The spirit of Jesus dwells not in
   coteries of self-willed, opinionative men, but in the great
   commonwealth of saints, and especially in the hearts of those who love
   the whole body more than any part, not excepting that to which they
   themselves belong; to whom the Lord and Head of the church fulfill His
   promise, by enriching them with magnanimous heroic graces, and causing
   them to rise like cedars above the general level of contemporary
   character, and endowing them with a moral power which exercises an
   ever-widening influence long after the strifes of their age, and the
   men who delighted in them, have sunk into oblivion.

   churches to the seventeenth century. Our Amphictyonic council is yet,
   like Plato's Republic, in nubibus. Perhaps disintegration must go
   farther before the era of reconstruction arrives. Or is it ever to
   arrive? Is the day for catholic Christianity past?

15. THE SONS OF THUNDER

    Luke 9:51-56.

   The delivery of the discourse on humility appears to have been the
   closing act of our Lord's ministry in Galilee; for immediately after
   finishing their accounts of the discourse, the two first evangelists
   proceed to speak of what we have reason to regard as His final
   departure from His native province for the south. "It came to pass,"
   says Matthew, "that when Jesus had finished these sayings, He departed
   from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judea." [354] Of this journey
   neither Matthew nor Mark gives any details: they do not even mention
   Christ's visit to Jerusalem at the feast of dedication in winter,
   referred to by John, [355] from which we know that the farewell to
   Galilee took place at least some four months before the crucifixion.
   The journey, however, was not without its interesting incidents, as we
   know from Luke, who has preserved several of them in his Gospel. [356]

   Of these incidents, that recorded in the passage above cited is one.
   For the words with which the evangelist introduces his narrative
   obviously allude to the same journey from Galilee to the south, of
   which Matthew and Mark speak in the passages already referred to. The
   journey through Samaria adverted to here by Luke occurred "when the
   time was come (or rather coming) [357] that He (Jesus) should be
   received up," that is, towards the close of His life. Then the peculiar
   expression, "He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem," hints not
   obscurely at a final transference of the scene of Christ's work from
   the north to the south. It refers not merely to the geographical
   direction in which He was going, but also, and chiefly, to the state of
   mind in which He journeyed. He went towards Jerusalem, feeling that His
   duty lay in and near it henceforth, as a victim self-consecrated to
   death, His countenance wearing a solemn, earnest, dignified aspect,
   expressive of the great lofty purpose by which His soul was animated.

   It was natural that Luke, the companion of Paul and evangelist to the
   Gentiles, should carefully preserve this anecdote from the last journey
   of Jesus to Judea through Samaria. It served admirably the purpose he
   kept in view throughout in compiling his Gospel -- that, viz., of
   illustrating the catholicity of the Christian dispensation; and
   therefore he gathered it into his basket, that it might not be lost. He
   has brought it in at a very suitable place, just after the anecdote of
   the exorcist; for, not to speak of the link of association supplied in
   the name of John, the narrator in one case and an actor in the other,
   this incident, like the one recorded immediately before, exhibits a
   striking contrast between. the harsh spirit of the disciples and the
   gentle, benignant spirit of their Master. That contrast forms the moral
   interest of the story.

   The main fact in the story was this. The inhabitants of a certain
   Samaritan village at which Jesus and His traveling companions arrived
   at the close of a day's journey having declined, on being requested, to
   give them quarters for the night, James and John came to their Master,
   and proposed that the offending villagers should be destroyed by fire
   from heaven.

   It was a strange proposal to come from men who had been for years
   disciples of Jesus, and especially from one who, like John, had been in
   the Master's company at the time of that meeting with the woman by the
   well, and heard the rapturous words with which He spoke of the glorious
   new era that was dawning. [358] It shows how slow the best are to learn
   the heavenly doctrine and practice of charity. How startling, again, to
   think of this same John, a year or two after the date of this savage
   suggestion, going down from Jerusalem and preaching the gospel of Jesus
   the crucified in "many of the villages of the Samaritans," [359]
   possibly in this very village which he desired to see destroyed!

   Such are the contrasts which growth in grace brings. In the green,
   crude stage of the divine life, whose characteristics are
   opinionativeness, censoriousness, scrupulosity, intolerance, blind
   passionate zeal, John would play the part of a mimic Elijah; in his
   spiritual maturity, after the summer sun of Pentecost had wrought its
   effects in his soul, and sweetened all its acid juices, he became an
   ardent apostle of salvation, and exhibited in his character the soft,
   luscious fruits of "love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
   goodness, faith, meekness, and self-control." Such contrasts in the
   same character at different periods, however surprising, are perfectly
   natural. Amid all changes the elements of the moral being remain the
   same. The juice of the ripe apple is the same that was in the green
   fruit, plus sun-light and sun-heat. The zeal of the son of thunder did
   not disappear from John's nature after he became an apostle; it only
   became tempered by the light of wisdom, and softened by the heat of
   love. He did not even cease to hate, and become an indiscriminately
   amiable individual, whose charity made no distinction between good and
   evil. To the last, John was what he was at the first, an intense hater
   as well as an intense lover. But in his later years he knew better what
   to hate -- the objects of his abhorrence being hypocrisy, apostasy, and
   Laodicean insincerity; [360] not, as of old, mere ignorant rudeness and
   clownish incivility. He could distinguish then between wickedness and
   weakness, malice and prejudice; and while cherishing strong antipathy
   towards the one, he felt only compassion towards the other.

   To some it may seem a matter of wonder how a man capable of
   entertaining so revolting a purpose as is here ascribed to James and
   John could ever be the disciple whom Jesus loved. To understand this,
   it must be remembered that Jesus, unlike most men, could love a
   disciple not merely for what he was, but for what he should become. He
   could regard with complacency even sour grapes in their season for the
   sake of the goodly fruit into which they should ripen. Then, further,
   we must not forget that John, even when possessed by the devil of
   resentment, was animated by a purer and holier spirit. Along with the
   smoke of carnal passion there was some divine fire in his heart. He
   loved Jesus as intensely as he hated the Samaritans; it was his devoted
   attachment to his Master that made him resent their incivility so
   keenly. In his tender love for the Bridegroom of his soul, he was
   beautiful as a mother overflowing with affection in the bosom of her
   family; though in his hatred he was terrible as the same mother can be
   in her enmity against her family's foes. John's nature, in fact, was
   feminine both in its virtues and in its faults, and, like all feminine
   natures, could be both exquisitely sweet and exquisitely bitter. [361]

   Passing now from personal remarks on John himself to the truculent
   proposal emanating from him and his brother, we must beware of
   regarding it in the light of a mere extravagant ebullition of temper
   consequent upon a refusal of hospitality. No doubt the two brethren and
   all their fellow-disciples were annoyed by the unexpected incivility,
   nor can one wonder if it put them out of humor. Weary men are easily
   irritated, and it was not pleasant to be obliged to trudge on to
   another village after the fatigues of a day's journey. But we have too
   good an opinion of the twelve to fancy any of them capable of revenging
   rudeness by murder.

   The savage mood of James and John is not even thoroughly explained by
   the recollection that the churlish villagers were Samaritans, and that
   they were Jews. The chronic ill-will between the two races had
   unquestionably its own influence in producing ill-feeling on both
   sides. The nationality of the travellers was one, if not the sole
   reason, why the villagers refused them quarters. They were Galilean
   Jews going southwards to Jerusalem, and that was enough. Then the
   twelve, as Jews, were just as ready to take offence as the Samaritan
   villagers were to give it. The powder of national enmity was stored up
   in their breasts; and a spark, one rude word or insolent gesture, was
   enough to cause an explosion. Though they had been for years with
   Jesus, there was still much more of the old Jewish man than of the new
   Christian man in them. If they had been left to the freedom of their
   own will, they would probably have avoided the Samaritan territory
   altogether, and, like the rest of their countrymen, taken a roundabout
   way to Jerusalem by crossing to the eastward of the Jordan. Between
   persons so affected towards each other offences are sure to arise. When
   Guelph and Ghibeline, Orangemen and Ribbonmen, Cavalier and Roundhead
   meet, it does not take much to make a quarrel.

   But there was something more at work in the minds of the two disciples
   than party passion. There was conscience in their quarrel as well as
   temper and hereditary enmities. This is evident, both from the
   deliberate manner in which they made their proposal to Jesus, and from
   the reason by which they sought to justify it. They came to their
   Master, and said, "Wilt Thou that we command fire to come down from
   heaven, and consume them?" entertaining no doubt apparently of
   obtaining His approval, and of procuring forthwith the requisite fire
   from heaven for the execution of their dire intent. Then they quoted
   the precedent of Elijah, who, refusing to have any dealings with the
   idolatrous king of Samaria, called down fire from heaven to consume his
   messengers, as a signal mark of divine displeasure. [362] The conscious
   motive by which they were actuated was evidently sincere, though
   ill-informed, jealousy for the honor of their Lord. As the prophet of
   fire was indignant at the conduct of King Ahaziah in sending messengers
   to the god of Ekron, Baalzebub by name, to inquire whether he should
   recover from the disease with which he was afflicted; [363] so the sons
   of thunder were indignant because inhabitants of the same godless
   territory over which Ahaziah ruled had presumed to insult their revered
   Master by refusing a favor which they ought to have been only too proud
   to have an opportunity of granting.

   The two brothers thought they did well to be angry; and, if they had
   been minded to defend their conduct after it was condemned by Jesus,
   which they do not seem to have been, they might have made a defense by
   no means destitute of plausibility. For consider who these Samaritans
   were. They belonged to a mongrel race, sprung from heathen Assyrians,
   whose presence in the land was a humiliation, and from base, degenerate
   Israelites unworthy of the name. Their forefathers had been the bitter
   enemies of Judah in the days of Nehemiah, spitefully obstructing the
   building of Zion's walls, instead of helping the exiles in their hour
   of need, as neighbors ought to have done. Then, if it was unfair to
   hold the present generation responsible for the sins of past
   generations, what was the character of the Samaritans then living? Were
   they not blasphemous heretics, who rejected all the Old Testament
   Scriptures save the five books of Moses? Did they not worship at the
   site of the rival temple on Gerizim, [364] which their fathers had with
   impious effrontery erected in contempt of the true temple of God in the
   holy city? And finally, had not these villagers expressed their
   sympathy with all the iniquities of their people, and repeated them all
   in one act by doing dishonor to Him who was greater than even the true
   temple, and worthy not only to receive common civility, but even divine
   worship?

   Ruthless persecutors and furious zealots, furnished with such plausible
   pleas, have always been confident, like the two disciples, that they
   did God service. It is of the very nature of zealotry to make the man
   of whom it has taken possession believe that the Almighty not only
   approves, but shares his fierce passions, and fancy himself in trusted
   with a carte blanche to launch the thunders of the Most High against
   all in whom his small, peering, inhuman eye can discern aught not
   approved by his tyrannic conscience. What a world were this if the fact
   were so indeed!


   "Every pelting, petty officer

   Would use God's heaven for thunder; nothing but thunder."

   Thank God the fact is not so! The Almighty does thunder sometimes, but
   not in the way His petty officers would wish.


   "Merciful Heaven!

   Thou rather, with Thy sharp and sulphurous bolt,

   Splitt'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak

   Than the soft myrtle."

   Jesus too, all gentle as He was, had His thunderbolts; but He reserved
   them for other objects than poor, benighted, prejudiced Samaritans. His
   zeal was directed against great sins, and powerful, privileged,
   presumptuous sinners; not against little sins, or poor, obscure, vulgar
   sinners. He burst into indignation at the sight of His Father's house
   turned into a den of thieves by those who ought to have known, and did
   know better; He only felt compassion for those who, like the woman by
   the well, knew not what they worshipped, and groped after God in
   semi-heathen darkness. His spirit was kindled within Him at the
   spectacle of ostentatious orthodoxy and piety allied to the grossest
   worldliness; He did not, like the Pharisee, blaze up in sanctimonious
   wrath against irreligious publicans, who might do no worship at all, or
   who, like the heretical Samaritans, did not worship in the right place.
   Would that zeal like that of Jesus, aiming its bolts at the proud oak
   and sparing the humble shrub, were more common! But such zeal is
   dangerous, and therefore it will always be rare.

   The Master, in whose vindication the two disciples wished to call down
   heaven's destroying fire, lost no time in making known His utter want
   of sympathy with the monstrous proposal. He turned and rebuked them.
   According to the old English version, He said, "Ye know not what manner
   of spirit ye are of." [365] It is a doubtful reading, and as such is
   omitted in our Revised Version, but it is a true saying.

   The saying was true in more senses than one. The spirit of James and
   John was, in the first place, not such as they fancied. They thought
   themselves actuated by zeal for the glory of their Lord, and so they
   were in part. But the flame of their zeal was not pure: it was mixed up
   with the bitter smoke of carnal passions, anger, pride, self-will.
   Then, again, their spirit was not such as became the apostles of the
   gospel, the heralds of a new era of grace. They were chosen to preach a
   message of mercy to every creature, even to the chief of sinners; to
   tell of a love that suffered not itself to be overcome of evil, but
   sought to overcome evil with good; to found a kingdom composed of
   citizens from every nation, wherein should be neither Jew nor
   Samaritan, but Christ all and in all. What a work to be achieved by men
   filled with the fire-breathing spirit of the "sons of thunder"!
   Obviously a great change must be wrought within them to fit them for
   the high vocation wherewith they have been called. Yet again, the
   spirit of James and John was, of course, not that of their Master. He
   "came not to destroy men's lives, but to save them." [366] To see the
   difference between the mind of the disciples and that of Jesus, put
   this scene side by side with that other which happened on Samaritan
   ground -- the meeting by the well. We know what we have seen here: what
   see we there? The Son of man, as a Jew, speaking to and having dealings
   with a Samaritan, so seeking to abolish inveterate and deep-seated
   enmities between man and man; as the Friend of sinners seeking to
   restore a poor, erring, guilty creature to God and holiness; as the
   Christ announcing the close of an old time, in which the worship even
   of the true God was ritualistic, exclusive, and local, and the advent
   of a new religious era characterized by the attributes of spirituality,
   universality, and catholicity. And we see Jesus rejoicing, enthusiastic
   in His work; deeming it His very meat and drink to reveal to men one
   God and Father, one Saviour, one life, for all without distinction; to
   regenerate individual character, society, and religion; to break down
   all barriers separating man from God and from his fellow-men, and so to
   become the great Reconciler and Peacemaker. Thinking of this work as
   exhibited by sample in the conversion of the woman by the well, He
   speaks to His surprised and unsympathetic disciples as one who
   perceives on the eastern horizon the first faint streaks of light
   heralding the advent of a new glorious day, and all around, in the
   field of the world, yellow crops of grain ripe for the sickle. "It is
   coming on apace," He says in effect, "the blessed, long expected era,
   after a long night of spiritual darkness; the new world is about to
   begin: lift up your eyes and look on the fields of Gentile lands, and
   see how they be white already for the harvest!"

   At the time of the meeting by the well, the disciples who were with
   Jesus neither understood nor sympathized with His high thoughts and
   hopes. The bright prospect on which His eyes were riveted was not
   within their horizon. For them, as for children, the world was still
   small, a narrow valley bounded by hills on either side; while their
   Master, up on the mountain-top, saw many valleys beyond, in which He
   was interested, and out of which He believed many souls would find
   their way into the eternal kingdom. [367] For the disciples God was yet
   the God of the Jews only; salvation was for the Jews as well as of
   them: they knew of only one channel of grace -- Jewish ordinances; only
   one way to heaven -- that which lay through Jerusalem.

   At the later date to which the present scene belongs, the disciples,
   instead of progressing, seem to have retrograded. Old bad feelings seem
   to be intensified, instead of being replaced by new and better ones.
   They are now not merely out of sympathy with, but in direct antagonism
   to, their Lord's mind; not merely apathetic or skeptical about the
   salvation of Samaritans, but bent on their destruction. Aversion and
   prejudice have grown into a paroxysm of enmity.

   Yes, even so; things must get to the worst before they begin to mend.
   There will be no improvement till the Lamb shall have been slain to
   take away sin, to abolish enmities, and to make of twain one new man.
   It is the knowledge of that which makes Jesus set His face so
   steadfastly towards Jerusalem. He is eager to drink the cup of
   suffering, and to be baptized with the baptism of blood, because He
   knows that only thereby can He finish the work whereof He spoke in such
   glowing language on the earlier occasion to His disciples. The very
   wrath of His devoted followers against the Samaritan villagers makes
   Him quicken His pace on His crossward way, saying to Himself sadly as
   He advances, "Let me hasten on, for not till I am lifted up can these
   things end."

16. IN PEREA; OR, THE DOCTRINE OF SELF SACRIFICE
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. COUNSELS OF PERFECTION

    Matt. 19:1-26; Mark 10:1-27; Luke 18:15-27.

   After His final departure from Galilee, Jesus found for Himself a new
   place of abode and scene of labor for the brief remainder of His life,
   in the region lying to the eastward of the Jordan, at the lower end of
   its course. "He departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of
   Judea beyond Jordan." [368] We may say that He ended His ministry where
   it began, healing the sick, and teaching the high doctrines of the
   kingdom in the place which witnessed His consecration by baptism to His
   sacred work, and where He gained His first disciples. [369]

   This visit of Jesus to Persia towards the close of His career is a fact
   most interesting and significant in itself, apart altogether from its
   accompanying incidents. It was evidently so regarded by John, who not
   less carefully than the two first evangelists records the fact of the
   visit, though, unlike them, he gives no details concerning it. The
   terms in which he alludes to this event are peculiar. Having briefly
   explained how Jesus had provoked the ill-will of the Jews in Jerusalem
   at the feast of dedication, he goes on to say: "Therefore they sought
   again to take Him; but He escaped out of their hands, and went away
   again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized."
   [370] The word "again," and the reference to the Baptist, are
   indicative of reflection and recollection -- windows letting us see
   into John's heart. He is thinking with emotion of his personal
   experiences connected with the first visit of Jesus to those sacred
   regions, of his first meeting with his beloved Master, and of the
   mystic name given to Him by the Baptist, "the Lamb of God" then
   uncomprehended by the disciples, now on the eve of being expounded by
   events; and to the evangelist writing his Gospel, clear as day in the
   bright light of the cross.

   It was hardly possible that the disciple whom Jesus loved could do
   other than think of the first visit when speaking of the second. Even
   the multitude, as he records, reverted mentally to the earlier occasion
   while following Jesus in the later. They remembered what John, His
   forerunner, had said of One among them whom they knew not, and who yet
   was far greater than himself; and they remarked that his statements,
   however improbable they might have appeared at the time, had been
   verified by events, and he himself proved to be a true prophet by
   Christ's miracles, if not by his own. "John," said they to each other,
   "did no miracle; but all things that John said of this man were true."
   [371]

   If John the disciple, and even the common people, thought of the first
   visit of Jesus to Persia at the time of His second, we may be sure that
   Jesus Himself did so also. He had His own reasons, doubt it not, for
   going back to that hallowed neighborhood. His journey to the Jordan, we
   believe, was a pilgrimage to holy ground, on which He could not set His
   foot without profound emotion. For there lay His Bethel, where He had
   made a solemn baptismal vow, not, as Jacob, to give a tithe of His
   substance, but to give Himself, body and soul, a sacrifice to His
   Father, in life and in death; there the Spirit had descended on Him
   like a dove; there He had heard a celestial voice of approval and
   encouragement, the reward of His entire self-surrender to His Father's
   holy will. All the recollections of the place were heart stirring,
   recalling solemn obligations, inspiring holy hopes, urging Him on to
   the grand consummation of His life-work; charging Him by His baptism,
   His vows, the descent of the Spirit, and the voice from heaven, to
   crown His labors of love, by drinking of the cup of suffering and death
   for man's redemption. To these voices of the past He willingly opened
   His ear. He wished to hear them, that by their hallowed tones His
   spirit might be braced and solemnized for the coming agony.

   While retiring to Persia for these private reasons, that He might muse
   on the past and the future, and link sacred memories to solemn
   anticipations, Jesus did not by any means live there a life of
   seclusion and solitary meditation. On the contrary, during His sojourn
   in that neighborhood, He was unusually busy healing the sick, teaching
   the multitude "as He was wont" (so Mark states, with a mental reference
   to the past ministry in Galilee), answering inquiries, receiving
   visits, granting favors. "Many resorted unto Him" there on various
   errands. Pharisees came, asking entangling questions about marriage and
   divorce, hoping to catch Him in a trap, and commit Him to the
   expression of an opinion which would make Him unpopular with some party
   or school, Hillel's or Shammai's, [372] it did not matter which. A
   young ruler came with more honorable intent, to inquire how he might
   obtain eternal life. Mothers came with their little ones, beseeching
   for them His blessing, thinking it worth getting, and not fearing
   denial; and messengers came with sorrowful tidings from friends, who
   looked to Him as their comfort in the time of trouble. [373]

   Though busily occupied among the thronging crowd, Jesus contrived to
   have some leisure hours with His chosen disciples, during which He
   taught them some new lessons on the doctrine of the divine kingdom. The
   subject of these lessons was sacrifice for the sake of the kingdom -- a
   theme congenial to the place, the time, the situation, and the mood of
   the Teacher. The external occasion suggesting that topic was supplied
   by the interviews Jesus had had with the Pharisees and the young ruler.
   These interviews naturally led Him to speak to His disciples on the
   subject of self-sacrifice under two special forms, -- abstinence from
   marriage and renunciation of property, -- though He did not confine His
   discourse to these points, but went on to set forth the rewards of
   self-sacrifice in any form, and the spirit in which all sacrifices must
   be performed, in order to possess value in God's sight.

   The Pharisees, we read, "came unto Him, tempting Him, and saying, Is it
   lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?" To this
   question Jesus replied, by laying down the primitive principle, that
   divorce was justified only by conjugal infidelity, and by explaining,
   that any thing to the contrary in the law of Moses was simply an
   accommodation to the hardness of men's hearts. The disciples heard this
   reply, and they made their own remarks on it. They said to Jesus: "If
   the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry." The
   view enunciated by their Master, which took no account of
   incompatibility of temper, involuntary dislike, uncongeniality of
   habits, differences in religion, quarrels among relatives, as pleas for
   separation, seemed very stringent even to them; and they thought that a
   man would do well to consider what he was about before committing
   himself to a life-long engagement with such possibilities before him,
   and to ask himself whether it would not be better, on the whole, to
   steer clear of such a sea of troubles, by abstaining from wedlock
   altogether.

   The impromptu remark of the disciples, viewed in connection with its
   probable motives, was not a very wise one; yet it is to be observed
   that Jesus did not absolutely disapprove of it. He spoke as if He
   rather sympathized with the feeling in favor of celibacy, -- as if to
   abstain from marriage were the better and wiser way, and only not to be
   required of men because for the majority it was impracticable. "But he
   said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom
   it is given." Then going on to enumerate the cases in which, from any
   cause, men remained unmarried, He spoke with apparent approbation of
   some who voluntarily, and from high and holy motives, denied themselves
   the comfort of family relationships: "There be eunuchs which have made
   themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake." Such, He finally
   gave His disciples to understand, were to be imitated by all who felt
   called and able to do so. "He that is able to receive (this high
   virtue), let him receive it," He said; hinting that, while many men
   could not receive it, but could more easily endure all possible
   drawbacks of married life, even on the strictest views of conjugal
   obligation, than preserve perfect chastity in an unmarried state, it
   was well for him who could make himself a eunuch for the kingdom of
   heaven, as he would not only escape much trouble, but be free from
   carefulness, and be able to serve the kingdom without distraction.

   The other form of self-sacrifice -- the renunciation of property --
   became the subject of remark between Jesus and His disciples, in
   consequence of the interview with the young man who came inquiring
   about eternal life. Jesus, reading the heart of this anxious inquirer,
   and perceiving that he loved this world's goods more than was
   consistent with spiritual freedom and entire singleness of mind, had
   concluded His directions to him by giving this counsel: "If thou wilt
   be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and then
   thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, and follow me." The young
   man having thereon turned away sorrowful, because, though desiring
   eternal life, he was unwilling to obtain it at such a price, Jesus
   proceeded to make his case a subject of reflection for the instruction
   of the twelve. In the observations He made He did not expressly say
   that to part with property was necessary to salvation, but He did speak
   in a manner which seemed to the disciples almost to imply that. Looking
   round about, He remarked to them first, "How hardly shall they that
   have riches enter into the kingdom of God!" The disciples being
   astonished at this hard saying, He softened it somewhat by altering
   slightly the form of expression. "Children," he said, "how hard is it
   for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!" [374]
   hinting that the thing to be renounced in order to salvation was not
   money, but the inordinate love of it. But then He added a third
   reflection, which, by its austerity, more than cancelled the mildness
   of the second. "It is easier," He declared, "for a camel to go through
   the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of
   God." That assertion, literally interpreted, amounts to a declaration
   that the salvation of a rich man is an impossibility, and seems to
   teach by plain implication, that the only way for a rich man to get
   into heaven is to cease to be rich, and become poor by a voluntary
   renunciation of property. Such seems to have been the impression made
   thereby on the minds of the disciples: for we read that they were
   astonished above measure, and said among themselves, "Who then can be
   saved?" [375]

   It is an inquiry of vital moment what our Lord really meant to teach on
   the subjects of marriage and money. The question concerns not merely
   the life to come, but the whole character of our present life. For if
   man's life on earth doth not consist wholly in possessions and family
   relations, these occupy a very prominent place therein. Family
   relations are essential to the existence of society, and without wealth
   there could be no civilization. Did Jesus, then, frown or look down on
   these things, as at least unfavorable to, if not incompatible with, the
   interests of the divine kingdom and the aspirations of its citizens?

   This question up till the time of the Reformation was for the most part
   answered by the visible church in the affirmative. From a very early
   period the idea began to be entertained that Jesus meant to teach the
   intrinsic superiority, in point of Christian virtue, of a life of
   celibacy and voluntary poverty, over that of a married man possessing
   property. Abstinence from marriage and renunciation of earthly
   possessions came, in consequence, to be regarded as essential
   requisites for high Christian attainments. They were steps of the
   ladder by which Christians rose to higher grades of grace than were
   attainable by men involved in family cares and ties, and in the
   entanglements of worldly substance. They were not, indeed, necessary to
   salvation, -- to obtain, that is, a simple admission into heaven, --
   but they were necessary to obtain an abundant entrance. They were
   trials of virtue appointed to be undergone by candidates for honors in
   the city of God. They were indispensable conditions of the higher
   degrees of spiritual fruitfulness. A married or rich Christian might
   produce thirty-fold, but only those who denied themselves the
   enjoyments of wealth and wedlock could bring forth sixty-fold or an
   hundred-fold. While, therefore, these virtues of abstinence were not to
   be demanded of all, they were to be commended as "counsels of
   perfection" to such as, not content to be commonplace Christians, would
   rise to the heroic pitch of excellence, and, despising a simple
   admission into the divine kingdom, wished to occupy first places there.

   This style of thought is now so antiquated that it is hard to believe
   it ever prevailed. As a proof, however, that it is no invention of
   ours, take two brief extracts from a distinguished bishop and martyr of
   the third century, Cyprian of Carthage, which are samples of much of
   the same kind to be found in the early Fathers of the church. The one
   quotation proclaims the superior virtue of voluntary virginity in these
   terms: "Strait and narrow is the way which leads to life, hard and
   arduous is the path (limes, narrower still than the narrow way) which
   tends to glory. Along this path of the way go the martyrs, go virgins,
   go all the just. For the first (degree of fruitfulness), the
   hundred-fold, is that of the martyrs; the second, the sixty-fold, is
   yours (ye virgins)." [376] The second extract, while ascribing, like
   the first, superior merit to virginity, indicates the optional
   character of that high-class virtue. Referring to the words of Christ,
   "There be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of
   heaven's sake," Cyprian says: "This the Lord commands not, but exhorts;
   He imposes not the yoke of necessity, that the free choice of the will
   might remain. But whereas he says (John xiv. 2), that there are many
   mansions with His Father, He here points out the lodging quarters of
   the better mansion (melioris habitaculi hospitia). Seek ye, O virgins,
   those better mansions. Crucifying (castrantes) the desires of the
   flesh, obtain for yourselves the reward of greater grace in the
   celestial abodes." [377]

   Similar views were entertained in those early ages respecting the
   meaning of Christ's words to the young man. The inevitable results of
   such interpretations in due course were monastic institutions and the
   celibacy of the clergy. The direct connection between an ascetic
   interpretation of the counsel given by Jesus to the rich youth who
   inquired after eternal life, and the rise of monasticism, is apparent
   in the history of Antony, the father of the monastic system. It is
   related of him, that going into the church on one occasion when the
   Gospel concerning the rich young man was read before the assembly, he,
   then also young, took the words as addressed by Heaven to himself.
   Going out of the church, he forthwith proceeded to distribute to the
   inhabitants of his native village his large, fertile, and beautiful
   landed estates which he inherited from his fathers, reserving only a
   small portion of his property for the benefit of his sister. Not long
   after he gave away that also, and placed his sister to be educated with
   a society of pious virgins, and settling down near his paternal
   mansion, began a life of rigid asceticism. [378]

   The ascetic theory of Christian virtue, which so soon began to prevail
   in the church, has been fully tested by time, and proved to be a huge
   and mischievous mistake. The verdict of history is conclusive, and to
   return to an exploded error, as some seem disposed to do, is utter
   folly. At this time of day, the views of those who would find the
   beau-ideal of Christian life in a monk's cell appear hardly worthy of
   serious refutation. It may, however, be useful briefly to indicate the
   leading errors of the monkish theory of morals; all the more that, in
   doing this, we shall at the same time be explaining the true meaning of
   our Lord's words to His disciples.

   This theory, then, is in the first place based on an erroneous
   assumption -- viz., that abstinence from things lawful is intrinsically
   a higher sort of virtue than temperance in the use of them. This is not
   true. Abstinence is the virtue of the weak, temperance is the virtue of
   the strong. Abstinence is certainly the safer way for those who are
   prone to inordinate affection, but it purchases safety at the expense
   of moral culture; for it removes us from those temptations connected
   with family relationships and earthly possessions, through which
   character, while it may be imperilled, is at the same time developed
   and strengthened. Abstinence is also inferior to temperance in
   healthiness of tone. It tends inevitably to morbidity, distortion,
   exaggeration. The ascetic virtues were wont to be called by their
   admirers angelic. They are certainly angelic in the negative sense of
   being unnatural and inhuman. Ascetic abstinence is the ghost or
   disembodied spirit of morality, while temperance is its soul, embodied
   in a genuine human life transacted amid earthly relations, occupations,
   and enjoyments. Abstinence is even inferior to temperance in respect to
   what seems its strong point -- self-sacrifice. There is something
   morally sublime, doubtless, in the spectacle of a man of wealth, birth,
   high office, and happy domestic condition, leaving rank, riches,
   office, wife, children, behind, and going away to the deserts of Sinai
   and Egypt to spend his days as a monk or anchoret. [379] The stern
   resolution, the absolute mastery of the will over the natural
   affections, exhibited in such conduct, is very imposing. Yet how poor,
   after all, is such a character compared with Abraham, the father of the
   faithful, and model of temperance and singleness of mind; who could use
   the world, of which he had a large portion, without abusing it; who
   kept his wealth and state, and yet never became their slave, and was
   ready at God's command to part with his friends and his native land,
   and even with an only son! So to live, serving ourselves heir to all
   things, yet maintaining unimpaired our spiritual freedom; enjoying
   life, yet ready at the call of duty to sacrifice life's dearest
   enjoyments: this is true Christian virtue, the higher Christian life
   for those who would be perfect. Let us have many Abrahams so living
   among our men of wealth, and there is no fear of the church going back
   to the Middle Ages. Only when the rich, as a class, are luxurious,
   vain, selfish, and proud, is there a danger of the tenet gaining
   credence among the serious, that there is no possibility of living a
   truly Christian life except by parting with property altogether.

   The ascetic theory is also founded on an error in the interpretation of
   Christ's sayings. These do not assert or necessarily imply any
   intrinsic superiority of celibacy and voluntary poverty over the
   conditions to which they are opposed. They only imply, that in certain
   circumstances the unmarried dispossessed state affords peculiar
   facilities for attending without distraction to the interests of the
   divine kingdom. This is certainly true. It is less easy sometimes to be
   single-minded in the service of Christ as a married person than as an
   unmarried, as a rich man than as a poor man. This is especially true in
   times of hardship and danger, when men must either not be on Christ's
   side at all, or be prepared to sacrifice all for His sake. The less one
   has to sacrifice in such a case, the easier it is for him to bear his
   cross and play the hero; and he may be pronounced happy at such a
   crisis who has no family to forsake and no worldly concerns to distract
   him. Personal character may suffer from such isolation: it may lose
   geniality, tenderness, and grace, and contract something of inhuman
   sternness; but the particular tasks required will be more likely to be
   thoroughly done. On this account, it may be said with truth that "the
   forlorn hope in battle, as well as in the cause of Christianity, must
   consist of men who have no domestic relations to divide their devotion,
   who will leave no wife nor children to mourn over their loss." [380]
   Yet this statement cannot be taken without qualification. For it is not
   impossible for married and wealthy Christians to take their place in
   the forlorn hope: many have done so, and those who do are the greatest
   heroes of all. The advantage is not necessarily and invariably on the
   side of those who are disengaged from all embarrassing relationships,
   even in time of war; and in times of peace it is all on the other side.
   Monks, like soldiers, are liable to frightful degeneracy and corruption
   when there are no great tasks for them to do. Men who in emergencies
   are capable, in consequence of their freedom from all domestic and
   secular embarrassments, of rising to an almost superhuman pitch of
   self-denial, may at other seasons sink to a depth of self-indulgence in
   sloth and sensuality which is rarely seen in those who enjoy the
   protecting influence of family ties and business engagements. [381]

   But not to insist further on this, and conceding frankly all that can
   be said in favor of the unmarried and dispossessed state in connection
   with the service of the kingdom in certain circumstances, what we are
   concerned to maintain is, that nowhere in the Gospel do we find the
   doctrine taught that such a state is in itself and essentially
   virtuous. It is absurd to say, as Renan does, [382] that the monk is in
   a sense the only true Christian. The natural type of the Christian is
   not the monk, but the soldier, both of whom are often placed in the
   same position in relation to marriage and property ties, but for
   altogether different reasons. The watchword of Christian ethics is not
   devoteeism, but devotion. Consuming devotion to the kingdom is the one
   cardinal virtue required of all citizens, and every stern word
   enjoining self-sacrifice is to be interpreted in relation thereto. "Let
   the dead bury their dead;." "No man having put his hand to the plough,
   and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God;." "If any man hate not
   father and mother, he cannot be my disciple;." "Sell all that thou
   hast, and come follow me" -- these and many other sayings of kindred
   import all mean one thing: the kingdom first, every thing else second,
   and when the interest of the holy state demands it, military
   promptitude in leaving all and repairing to the standards. Essentially
   the same idea is the key to the meaning of a difficult parable spoken
   to "the apostles," and recorded in Luke's Gospel, which we may call the
   parable of extra service. [383] The thought intended is that the
   service of the kingdom is very exacting, involving not only hard toil
   in the field through the day, but extra duties in the evening when the
   weary laborer would gladly rest, having no fixed hours of labor, eight,
   ten, or twelve, but claiming the right to summon to work at any hour of
   all the twenty-four, as in the case of soldiers in time of war, or of
   farm-laborers in time of harvest. And the extra service, or overtime
   duty, is not monkish asceticism, but extraordinary demands in unusual
   emergencies, calling men weary from age or from over-exertion to still
   further efforts and sacrifices.

   The theory under consideration is guilty, in the third place, of an
   error in logic. On the assumption that abstinence is necessarily and
   intrinsically a higher virtue than temperance, it is illogical to speak
   of it as optional. In that case, our Lord should have given not
   counsels, but commands. For no man is at liberty to choose whether he
   shall be a good Christian or an indifferent one, or is excused from
   practicing certain virtues merely because they are difficult. It is
   absolutely incumbent on all to press on towards perfection; and if
   celibacy and poverty be necessary to perfection, then all who profess
   godliness should renounce wedlock and property. The church of Rome,
   consistently with her theory of morals, forbids her priests to marry.
   But why stop there? Surely what is good for priests is good for people
   as well.

   The reason why the prohibition is not carried further, is of course
   that the laws of nature and the requirements of society render it
   impracticable. And this brings us to the last objection to the ascetic
   theory, viz. that, consistently carried out, it lands in absurdity, by
   involving the destruction of society and the human race. A theory which
   involves such consequences cannot be true. For the kingdom of grace and
   the kingdom of nature are not mutually destructive. One God is the
   sovereign of both; and all things belonging to the lower kingdom --
   every relation of life, every faculty, passion, and appetite of our
   nature, all material possessions -- are capable of being made
   subservient to the interests of the higher kingdom, and of contributing
   to our growth in grace and holiness.

   The grand practical difficulty is to give the kingdom of God and His
   righteousness their due place of supremacy, and to keep all other
   things in strict subordination. The object of those hard sayings
   uttered by Jesus in Persia was to fix the attention of the disciples
   and of all on that difficulty. He spoke so strongly, that men compassed
   by the cares of family and the comforts of wealth might duly lay to
   heart their danger; and, conscious of their own helplessness, might
   seek grace from God, to do that which, though difficult, is not
   impossible, viz. while married, to be as if unmarried, caring for the
   things of the Lord; and while rich, to be humble in mind, free in
   spirit, and devoted in heart to the service of Christ.

   One word may here aptly be said on the beautiful incident of the little
   children brought to Jesus to get His blessing. Who can believe that it
   was His intention to teach a monkish theory of morals after reading
   that story? How opportunely those mothers came to Him seeking a
   blessing for their little ones, just after He had uttered words which
   might be interpreted, and were actually interpreted in after ages, as a
   disparagement of family relations. Their visit gave Him an opportunity
   of entering His protest by anticipation against such a misconstruction
   of His teaching. And the officious interference of the twelve to keep
   away the mothers and their offspring from their Master's person only
   made that protest all the more emphatic. The disciples seem to have
   taken from the words Jesus had just spoken concerning abstaining from
   marriage for the sake of the kingdom, the very impression out of which
   monasticism sprang. "What does He care," thought they, "for you mothers
   and your children? His whole thoughts are of the kingdom of heaven,
   where they neither marry nor are given in marriage: go away, and don't
   trouble Him at this time." The Lord did not thank His disciples for
   thus guarding His person from intrusion like a band of over-zealous
   policemen. "He was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the
   little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is
   the kingdom of God." [384]

  SECTION II. THE REWARDS OF SELF-SACRIFICE

    Matt. xix. 27-30; Mark x. 28-31; Luke xviii. 28-30.

   The remarks of Jesus on the temptations of riches, which seemed so
   discouraging to the other disciples, had a different effect on the mind
   of Peter. They led him to think with self-complacency of the contrast
   presented by the conduct of himself and his brethren to that of the
   youth who came inquiring after eternal life. "We," thought he to
   himself, have done what the young man could not do, -- what, according
   to the statement just made by the Master, rich men find very hard to
   do; we have left all to follow Jesus. Surely an act so difficult and so
   rare must be very meritorious." With his characteristic frankness, as
   he thought so he spoke. "behold," said he with a touch of brag in his
   tone and manner, "owe have forsaken all, and followed Thee: what shall
   we have therefore?"

   To this question of Peter, Jesus returned a reply full at once of
   encouragement and of warning for the twelve, and for all who profess to
   be servants of God. First, with reference to the subject -- matter of
   Peter's inquiry, He set forth in glowing language the great rewards in
   store for him and his brethren; and not for them only, but for all who
   made sacrifices for the kingdom. Then, with reference to the
   self-complacent or calculating spirit which, in part at least, had
   prompted the inquiry, He added a moral reflection, with an illustrative
   parable appended, conveying the idea that rewards in the kingdom of God
   were not determined merely by the fact, or even by the amount, of
   sacrifice. Many that were first in these respects might be last in real
   merit, for lack of another element which formed an essential ingredient
   in the calculation, viz. right motive; while others who were last in
   these respects might be first in recompense in virtue of the spirit by
   which they were animated. We shall consider these two parts of the
   reply in succession. Our present theme is the rewards of self-sacrifice
   in the divine kingdom.

   The first thing which strikes one in reference to these rewards, is the
   utter disproportion between them and the sacrifices made. The twelve
   had forsaken fishing-boats and nets, and they were to be rewarded with
   thrones; and every one that forsakes any thing for the kingdom, no
   matter what it may be, is promised an hundred-fold in return, in this
   present life, of the very thing he has renounced, and in the world to
   come life everlasting.

   These promises strikingly illustrate the generosity of the Master whom
   Christians serve. How easy it would have been for Jesus to depreciate
   the sacrifices of His followers, and even to turn their glory into
   ridicule! "You have forsaken all! What was your all worth, pray? If the
   rich young man had parted with his possessions as I counsel led, he
   might have had something to boast of; but as for you poor fishermen,
   any sacrifices you have made are hardly deserving of mention." But such
   words could not have been uttered by Christ's lips. It was never His
   way to despise things small in outward bulk, or to disparage services
   rendered to Himself, as if with a view to diminish His own obligations.
   He rather loved to make Himself a debtor to His servants, by generously
   exaggerating the value of their good deeds, and promising to them, as
   their fit recompense, rewards immeasurably exceeding their claims. So
   He acted in the present instance. Though the "all" of the disciples was
   a very little one, He still remembered that it was their all; and with
   impassioned earnestness, with a "verily" full of tender, grateful
   feeling, He promised them thrones as if they had been fairly earned!

   These great and precious promises, if believed, would make sacrifices
   easy. Who would not part with a fishing-boat for a throne? and what
   merchant would stick at an investment which would bring a return, not
   of five per cent., or even of a hundred per cent., but of a hundred to
   one?

   The promises made by Jesus have one other excellent effect when duly
   considered. They tend to humble. Their very magnitude has a sobering
   effect on the mind. Not even the vainest can pretend that their good
   deeds deserve to be rewarded with thrones, and their sacrifices to be
   recompensed an hundred-fold. At this rate, all must be content to be
   debtors to God's grace, and all talk of merit is out of the question.
   That is one reason why the rewards of the kingdom of heaven are so
   great. God bestows His gifts so as at once to glorify the Giver and to
   humble the receiver.

   Thus far of the rewards in general. Looking now more narrowly at those
   specially made to the twelve, we remark that on the surface they seem
   fitted to awaken or foster false expectation. Whatever they meant in
   reality, there can be little doubt as to the meaning the disciples
   would put on them at the time. The "regeneration" and the "thrones" of
   which their Master stake would bring before their imagination the
   picture of a kingdom of Israel restored, -- regenerated in the sense in
   which men speak of a regenerated Italy, -- the yoke of foreign
   domination thrown off; alienated tribes reconciled and reunited under
   the rule of Jesus, proclaimed by popular enthusiasm their hero King;
   and themselves, the men who had first believed in His royal pretensions
   and shared His early fortunes, rewarded for their fidelity by being
   made provincial governors, each ruling over a separate tribe. These
   romantic ideas were never to be realized: and we naturally ask why
   Jesus, knowing that, expressed Himself in language fitted to encourage
   such baseless fancies? The answer is, that He could not accomplish the
   end He designed, which was to inspire His disciples with hope, without
   expressing His promise in terms which involved the risk ox illusion.
   Language so chosen as to obviate all possibility of misconception
   caption would have had no inspiring influence whatever. The promise, to
   have any charm, must be like a rainbow, bright in its hues, and solid
   and substantial in its appearance. This remark applies not only to the
   particular promise now under consideration, but more or less to all
   God's promises in Scripture or in nature. In order to stimulate, they
   must to a certain extent deceive us, by promising that which, as we
   conceive it, and cannot at the time help conceiving it, will never be
   realized. [385] The rainbow is painted in such colors as to draw us,
   children as we are, irresistibly on; and then, having served that end,
   it fades away. When this happens, we are ready to exclaim, "O Lord,
   Thou host deceived me!" but we ultimately find that we are not cheated
   out of the blessing, though it comes in a different form from what we
   expected. God's promises are never delusive, though they may be
   illusive. Such was the experience of the twelve in connection with the
   dazzling promise of thrones. They did not get what they expected; but
   they got something analogous, something which to their mature spiritual
   judgment appeared far greater and more satisfying than that on which
   they had first set their hearts. [386]

   What, then, was this Something? A real glory, honor, and power in the
   kingdom of God, conferred on the twelve as the reward of their
   self-sacrifice, partially in this life, perfectly in the life to come.
   In so far as the promise referred to this present life, it was shown by
   the event to signify the judicial legislative influence of the
   companions of Jesus as apostles and founders of the Christian church.
   The twelve, as the first preachers of the gospel trained by the Lord
   for that end, occupied a position in the church that could be filled by
   none that came after them. The keys of the kingdom of heaven were put
   into their hands. They were the foundation-stones on which the walls of
   the church were built. They sat, so to speak, on episcopal thrones,
   judging, guiding, ruling the twelve tribes of the true Israel of God,
   the holy commonwealth embracing all who professed faith in Christ. Such
   a sovereign influence the twelve apostles exerted in their lifetime;
   yea, they continue to exert it still. Their word not only was, but
   still is, law; their example has ever been regarded as binding on all
   ages. From their epistles, as the inspired expositions of their
   Master's pregnant sayings, the church has derived the system of
   doctrine embraced in her creed All that remains of their writings forms
   part of the sacred canon, and all their recorded words are accounted by
   believers "words of God." Surely here is power and authority nothing
   short of regal! The reality of sovereignty is here, though the
   trappings of royalty, which strike the vulgar eye, are wanting. The
   apostles of Jesus were princes indeed, though they wore no princely
   robes; and they were destined to exercise a more extensive sway than
   ever fell to the lot of any monarch of Israel, not to speak of
   governors of single tribes.

   The promise to the twelve had doubtless a reference to their position
   in the church in heaven as well as in the church on earth. What they
   will be in the eternal kingdom we know not, any more than we know what
   we ourselves shall be, our notions of heaven altogether being very
   hazy. We believe, however, on the ground of clear Scripture statements,
   that men will not be on a dead level in heaven any more than on earth.
   Radicalism is not the law of the supernal commonwealth, even as it is
   not the law in any well-ordered society in this world. The kingdom of
   glory will be but the kingdom of grace perfected, the regeneration
   begun here brought to its final and complete development. But the
   regeneration, in its imperfect state, is an attempt to organize men
   into a society based on the possession of spiritual life, all being
   included in the kingdom who are new creatures in Christ Jesus, and the
   highest place being assigned to those who have attained the highest
   stature as spiritual men. This ideal has never been more than
   approximately realized. The "visible" church, the product of the
   attempt to realize it, is, and ever has been, a most disappointing
   embodiment, in outward visible shape, of the ideal city of God.
   Ambition, selfishness, worldly wisdom, courtly arts, have too often
   procured thrones for false apostles, who never forsook any thing for
   Christ. Therefore we still look forward and upward with longing eyes
   for the true city of God, which shall as far exceed our loftiest
   conceptions as the visible church comes short of them. In that ideal
   commonwealth perfect moral order will prevail. Every man shall be in
   his own true place there; no vile men shall be in high places, no noble
   souls shall be doomed to obstruction, obscurity, and neglect; but the
   noblest will be the highest and first, even though now they be the
   lowest and last. "There shall be true glory, where no one shall be
   praised by mistake or in flattery; true honor, which shall be denied to
   no one worthy, granted to no one unworthy; nor shall any unworthy one
   ambitiously seek it, where none but the worthy are permitted to be."
   [387]

   Among the noblest in the supernal commonwealth will be the twelve men
   who cast in their lot with the Son of man, and were His companions in
   His wanderings and temptations. There will probably be many in heaven
   greater than they in intellect and otherwise; but the greatest will
   most readily concede to them the place of honor as the first to believe
   in Jesus, the personal friends of the Man of Sorrow, and the chosen
   vessels who carried His name to the nations, and in a sense opened the
   kingdom of heaven to all who believe. [388]

   Such we conceive to be the import of the promise made to the apostles,
   as leaders of the white-robed band of martyrs and confessors who suffer
   for Christ's sake. We have next to notice the general promise made to
   all the faithful indiscriminately. "There is no man," so it runs in
   Mark, "that heath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
   mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospel's,
   but he shall receive an hundred-fold now in this Timex houses, and
   brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with
   persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life."

   This promise also, like the special one to the twelve, has a twofold
   reference. Godliness is represented as profitable for both worlds. In
   the world to come the men who make sacrifices for Christ will receive
   eternal life; in the present they shall receive, along with
   persecutions, an hundred-fold of the very things which have been
   sacrificed. As to the former of these, eternal life, it is to be
   understood as the minimum reward in the great Hereafter. All the
   faithful will get that at least. What a maximum is that minimum! How
   blessed to be assured on the word of Christ that there is such a thing
   as eternal life attainable on any terms! We may well play the man for
   truth and conscience, and fight the good fight of faith, when, by so
   doing, it is possible for us to gain such a prize. "A hope so great and
   so divine may trials well endure." To win the crown of an imperishable
   life of bliss, we should not deem it an unreasonable demand on the
   Lord's part that we be faithful even unto death. Life sacrificed on
   these terms is but a river emptying itself into the ocean, or the
   morning star posing itself in the perfect light of day. Would that we
   could lay hold firmly of the blessed hope set before us here, and
   through its magic influence become transformed into moral heroes! We in
   these days have but a faint belief in the life to come. Our eyes are
   dim, and we cannot see the land that is afar off. Some of us have
   become so philosophical as to imagine we can do without the future
   reward promised by Jesus, and play the hero on atheistical principles.
   That remains to be seen. The annals of the martyrs tell us what men
   have been able to achieve who earnestly believed in the life
   everlasting. Up to this date we have not heard of any great heroisms
   enacted or sacrifices made by unbelievers. The martyrology of
   skepticism has not yet been written. [389]

   That part of Christ's promise which respects hereafter must be taken on
   trust; but the other part, which concerns the present life, admits of
   being tested by observation. The question, therefore, may competently
   be put: Is it true, as matter of fact, that sacrifices are recompensed
   by an hundredfold -- that is, a manifold [390] -- return in kind in
   this world? To this question we may reply, first, that the promise will
   be found to hold good with the regularity of a law, if we do not
   confine our view to the individual life, but include successive
   generations. When providence has had time to work out its results, the
   meek do, at least by their heirs and representatives, inherit the
   earth, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace. The persecuted
   cause at length conquers the world's homage, and receives from it such
   rewards as it can bestow. The words of the prophet are then fulfilled:
   "The children which thou shalt have, after thou host lost the other (by
   persecutor's hands), shall say again in twine ears, The place is too
   strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell." [391] And again:
   "Lift up thine eyes round about, and see; all they gather themselves
   together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy
   daughters shall be nursed at thy side. Then thou shalt see, and flow
   together, and twine heart shall throb and swell; because the abundance
   of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the wealth of the Gentiles
   shall come unto thee. Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles,
   and shalt suck the breast of kings. For brass I will bring gold, and
   for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron."
   [392] These prophetic promises, extravagant though they seem, have been
   fulfilled again and again in the history of the church: in the early
   ages, under Constantine, after the fires of persecution kindled by
   pagan zeal for hoary superstitions and idolatries had finally died out;
   [393] in Protestant Britain, once famous for men who were ready to lose
   all, and who did actually lose much, for Christ's sake, now mistress of
   the seas, and heiress of the wealth of all the world; in the new world
   across the Atlantic, with its great, powerful, populous nation,
   rivaling England in wealth and strength, grown from a small band of
   Puritan exiles who loved religious liberty better than country, and
   sought refuge from despotism in the savage wildernesses of an
   unexplored continent.

   Still it must be confessed that, taken strictly and literally, the
   promise of Christ does not hold good in every instance. Multitudes of
   God's servants have had what the world would account a miserable lot.
   Does the promise, then, simply and absolutely fail in their case? No;
   for, secondly, there are more ways than one in which it can be
   fulfilled. Blessings, for example, may be multiplied an hundred-fold
   without their external bulk being altered, simply by the act of
   renouncing them. Whatever is sacrificed for truth, whatever we are
   willing to part with for Christ's sake, becomes from that moment
   immeasurably increased in value. Fathers and mothers, and all earthly
   friends, become unspeakably dear to the heart when we have learned to
   say: "Christ is first, and these must be second." Isaac was worth an
   hundred sons to Abraham when he received him back from the dead. Or, to
   draw an illustration from another quarter, think of John Bunyan in jail
   brooding over his poor blind daughter, whom he left behind at home.
   "Poor child, thought I," thus he describes his feelings in that
   inimitable book, Grace Abounding, "what sorrow art thou like to have
   for thy portion in this world! Thou must be beaten, must beg, suffer
   hunger, cold, nakedness, and a thousand calamities, though I cannot now
   endure the wind should blow upon thee. But yet, thought I, I must
   venture you all with God, though it goeth to the quick to leave you.
   Oh! I saw I was as a man who was pulling down his house upon the heads
   of his wife and children; yet I thought on those two milch kine that
   were to carry the ark of God into another country, and to leave their
   calves behind them." If the faculty of enjoyment be, as it is, the
   measure of real possession, here was a case in Which to forsake wife
   and child was to multiply them an hundred-fold, and in the multiplied
   value of the things renounced to find a rich solarium for sacrifice and
   persecutions. The soliloquy of the Bedford prisoner is the very poetry
   of natural affection. What pathos is in that allusion to the Mitch
   Kline! what a depth of tender feeling it reveals! The power to feel so
   is the reward of self-sacrifice; the power to Jove so is the reward of
   "hating" our kindred for Christ's sake. You shall find no such love
   among those who make natural affection an excuse for moral
   unfaithfulness, thinking it a sufficient apology for disloyalty to the
   interests of the divine kingdom to say, "I have a wife and family to
   care for."

   Without undue spiritualizing, then, we see that a valid meaning can be
   assigned to the strong expression, "an hundred-fold." And from the
   remarks just made, we see further why "persecutions" are thrown into
   the account, as if they were not drawbacks, but a part of the gain. The
   truth is, the hundred-fold is realized, not in spite of persecutions,
   but to a great extent because of them. Persecutions are the salt with
   which things sacrificed are salted, the condiment which enhances their
   relish. Or, to put the matter arithmetically, persecutions are the
   factor by which earthly blessings given up to God are multiplied an
   hundred-fold, if not in quantity, at least in virtue.

   Such are the rewards provided for those who make sacrifices for
   Christ's sake. Their sacrifices are but a seed sown in tars, from which
   they afterwards reap a plentiful harvest in joy. But what now of those
   who have made no sacrifices, who have received no wounds in battle? If
   this has proceeded not from lack of will, but from lack of opportunity,
   they shall get a share of the rewards. David's law has its place in the
   divine kingdom: "As his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall
   his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike." Only
   all must see to it that they remain not by the stuff from cowardice, or
   indolence and self-indulgence. They who act thus, declining to put
   themselves to any trouble, to run any risk, or even so much us to part
   with a sinful lust for the kingdom of God, cannot expect to find a
   place therein at the last.

   [386] The question, What was Christ's doctrine concerning the kingdom
   in its future final form, is one of the most difficult in the whole
   range of gospel studies. Some have maintained that that doctrine is
   ambiguous, not self-consistent, variable; now apocalyptic and sensuous,
   now ideal and spiritual. Pfleiderer says that the kingdom, as Christ
   set it forth, was both spiritual-inward and sensuous-outward, purely
   human and religious and Judaico-theocratic. We cannot go critically
   into the matter here.

   hope. Nirvana, even if it mean annihilation, was as much an object of
   hope to Buddha as heaven and everlasting like is to a Christian. The
   dogma of transmigration had made continued life such a horror, that
   extinction appeared a boon. Further, Nirvana is not, like annihilation
   to the materialist, a matter of physical necessity irrespective of
   character: it is the high reward of virtue.

  SECTION III. THE FIRST LAST, AND THE LAST FIRST

    Matt. xix. 30; xx. 1-20; Mark x. 31.

   Having declared the rewards of self-sacrifice, Jesus proceeded to show
   the risk of forfeiture or partial loss arising out of the indulgence of
   unworthy feelings, whether as motives to self-denying acts, or as
   self-complacent reflections on such acts already performed. "But," He
   said in a warning manner, as if with upraised finger, "many that are
   first shall be last, and the last shall be first." Then, to explain the
   profound remark, He uttered the parable preserved in Matthew's Gospel
   only, which follows immediately after.

   The explanation is in some respects more difficult than the thing to be
   explained, and has given rise to much diverse interpretation. And yet
   the main drift of this parable seems clear enough. It is not, as some
   have supposed, designed to teach that all will share alike in the
   eternal kingdom, which is not only irrelevant to the connection of
   thought, but untrue. Neither is the parable intended to proclaim the
   great evangelic truth that salvation is of grace and not of merit,
   though it may be very proper in preaching to take occasion to discourse
   on that fundamental doctrine. The great outstanding thought set forth
   therein, as it seems to us, is this, that in estimating the value of
   work, the divine Lord whom all serve takes into account not merely
   quantity, but quality; that is, the spirit in which the work is done.

   The correctness of this view is apparent when we take a comprehensive
   survey of the whole teaching of Jesus on the important subject of work
   and wages in the divine kingdom, from which it appears that the
   relation between the two things is fixed by righteous law, caprice
   being entirely excluded; so that if the first in work be last in wages
   in any instances, it is for very good reasons.

   There are, in all, three parables in the Gospels on the subject
   referred to, each setting forth a distinct idea, and, in case our
   interpretation of the one at present to be specially considered is
   correct, all combined presenting an exhaustive view of the topic to
   which they relate. They are the parables of the Talents [394] and of
   the Pounds, [395] and the one before us, called by way of distinction
   "the Laborers in the Vineyard."

   In order to see how these parables are at once distinct and mutually
   complementary, it is necessary to keep in view the principles on which
   the value of work is to be determined. Three things must be taken into
   account in order to form a just estimate of men's works, viz. the
   quantity of work done, the ability of the worker, and the motive.
   Leaving out of view meantime the motive: when the ability is equal,
   quantity determines relative merit; and when ability varies, then it is
   not the absolute amount, but the relation of the amount to the ability
   that ought to determine value.

   The parables of the Pounds and of the Talents are designed to
   illustrate respectively these two propositions. In the former parable
   the ability is the same in all, each servant receiving one pound; but
   the quantity of work done varies, one servant with his pound gaining
   ten pounds, while another with the same amount gains only five. Now, by
   the above rule, the second should not be rewarded as the first, for he
   has not done what he might. Accordingly, in the parable a distinction
   is made, both in the rewards given to the two servants, and in the
   manner in which they are respectively addressed by their employer. The
   first gets ten cities to govern, and these words of commendation in
   addition: "Well, thou good servant; because thou host been faithful in
   a very little, have thou authority over ten cities." The second, on the
   other hand, gets only five cities, and what is even more noticeable, no
   praise. His master says to him dryly, "Be thou also over five cities."
   He had done somewhat, in comparison with idlers even something
   considerable, and therefore his service is acknowledged and
   proportionally rewarded. But he is not pronounced a good and faithful
   servant; and the eulogy is withheld, simply because it was not
   deserved: for he had not done what he could, but only half of what was
   possible, taking the first servant's work as the measure of
   possibility.

   In the parable of the Talents the conditions are different. There the
   amount of work done varies, as in the parable of the Pounds; but the
   ability varies in the same proportion, so that the ratio between the
   two is the same in the case of both servants who put their talents to
   use. One receives five, and gains five; the other receives two, and
   gains two According to our rule, these two should be equal in merit;
   and so they are represented in the parable. The same reward is assigned
   to each, and both are commended in the very same terms; the master's
   words in either case being: "Well done, good and faithful servant; thou
   host been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
   things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord."

   Thus the case stands when we take into account only the two elements of
   ability to work and the amount of work done; or, to combine both into
   one, the element of zeal. But there is more than zeal to be considered,
   at least in the kingdom of God. In this world men are often commended
   for their diligence irrespective of their motives; and it is not always
   necessary even to be zealous in order to gain vulgar applause. If one
   do something that looks large and liberal, men will praise him without
   inquiring whether for him it was a great thing, a heroic act involving
   self-sacrifice, or only a respectable act, not necessarily indicative
   of earnestness or devotion. But in God's sight many bulky things are
   very little, and many small things are very great. The reason is, that
   He Seth the heart, and the hidden springs of action there, and judges
   the stream by the fountain. Quantity is nothing to Him, unless there be
   zeal; and even zeal is nothing to Him, unless it be purged from all
   vain glory and self-seeking -- a pure spring of good impulses; cleared
   of all smoke of carnal passion -- a pure flame of heaven-born devotion.
   A base motive vitiates all.

   To emphasize this truth, and to insist on the necessity of right
   motives and emotions in connection with work and sacrifices, is the
   design of the parable spoken by Jesus in Peraea. It teaches that a
   small quantity of work done in a right spirit is of greater value than
   a large quantity done in a wrong spirit, however zealously it may have
   been performed. One hour's work done by men who make no bargain is of
   greater value than twelve hours' work done by men who have borne the
   heat and burden of the day, but who regard their doings with
   self-complacency Put in receptive form, the lesson of the parable is:
   Work not as hirelings basely calculating, or as Pharisees arrogantly
   exacting, the wages to which you deem yourselves entitled; work humbly,
   as deeming yourselves unprofitable servants at best; generously, as men
   superior to selfish calculations of advantage; trustfully, as men who
   confide in the generosity of the great Employer, regarding Him as one
   from whom you need not to protect yourselves by making beforehand a
   firm and fast bargain.

   In this interpretation, it is assumed that the spirit of the first and
   of the last to enter the vineyard was respectively such as has been
   indicated; and the assumption is justified by the manner in which the
   parties are described. In what spirit the last worked may be inferred
   from their making no bargain; and the temper of the first is manifest
   from their own words at the end of the day: "These last," said they,
   "have wrought but one hour, and thou host made them equal to us, which
   have borne the burden and heat of the day." This is the language of
   envy, jealousy, and self-esteem, and it is in keeping with the conduct
   of these laborers at the commencement of the day's work; for they
   entered the vineyard as hirelings, having made a bargain, agreeing to
   work for a stipulated amount of wages.

   The first and last, then, represent two classes among the professed
   servants of God. The first are the calculating and self-complacent; the
   last are the humble, the self-forgetful, the generous, the trustful.
   The first are the Jacobs, plodding, conscientious, able to say for
   themselves, "Thus I was: in the day the drought consumed me, and the
   frost by night, and the sleep departed from mine eyes;." yet ever
   studious of their own interest, taking care even in their religion to
   make a sure bargain for themselves, and trusting little to the free
   grace and unfettered generosity of the great Lord. The last are
   Abraham-like men, not in the lateness of their service, but in the
   magnanimity of their faith, entering the vineyard without bargaining,
   as Abraham left his father's house, knowing not whither he was to go,
   but knowing only that God had said, "Go to a land that I shall show
   thee." The first are the Simons, righteous, respectable, exemplary, but
   hard, prosaic, ungenial; the last are the women with alabaster boxes,
   who for long have been idle, aimless, vicious, wasteful of life, but at
   last, with bitter tears of sorrow over an unprofitable past, begin life
   in earnest, and endeavor to redeem lost time by the passionate devotion
   with which they serve their Lord and Savior. The first, once more, are
   the elder brothers who stay at home in their father's house, and never
   transgress any of his commandments, and have no mercy on those who do;
   the last are the prodigals, who leave their father's house and waste
   their substance on riotous living, but at length come to their senses,
   and say, "I will arise, and go to my father;." and having met him,
   exclaim, "Father, I have sinned, and am no more worthy to be called thy
   son: make me as one of thy hired servants."

   The two classes differing thus in character are treated in the parable
   precisely as they ought to be. The last are made first, and the first
   are made last. The last are paid first, to signify the pleasure which
   the master has in rewarding them. They are also paid at a much higher
   rate; for, receiving the same sum for one hour's work that the others
   receive for twelve, they are paid at the rate of twelve pence per diem.
   They are treated, in fact, as the prodigal was, for whom the father
   made a feast; while the "first" are treated as the elder brother, whose
   service was acknowledged, but who had to complain that his father never
   had given him a kid to make merry with his friends. Those who deem
   themselves unworthy to be any thing else than hired servants, and most
   unprofitable in that capacity, are dealt with as sons; and those who
   deem themselves most meritorious are treated coldly and distantly, as
   hired servants.

   Reverting now from the parable to the apophthegm it was designed to
   illustrate, we observe that the degradation of such as are first in
   ability, zeal, and length of service, to the last place as regards the
   reward, is represented as a thing likely to happen often. "Many that
   are first shall be last." This statement implies that self-esteem is a
   sin which easily besets men situated as the twelve, i. e. men who have
   made sacrifices for the kingdom of God. Now, that this is a fact
   observation proves; and it further teaches us that there are certain
   circumstances in which the laborious and self-denying are specially
   liable to fall into the vice of self-righteousness. It will serve to
   illustrate the deep and, to most minds on first view, obscure saying of
   Jesus, if we indicate here what these circumstances are.

   1. Those who make sacrifices for Christ's sake are in danger of falling
   into a self-righteous mood of mind, when the spirit of self-denial
   manifests itself in rare occasional acts, rather than in the form of a
   habit. In this case Christians rise at certain emergencies to an
   elevation of spirit far above the usual level of their moral feelings;
   and therefore, though at the time when the sacrifice was made they may
   have behaved heroically, they are apt afterwards to revert
   self-complacently to their noble deeds, as an old soldier goes back on
   his battles, and with Peter to ask, with a proud consciousness of merit
   for having forsaken all, What shall we have therefore? Verily, a state
   of mind greatly to be feared. A society in which spiritual pride and
   self-complacency prevails is in a bad way. One possessed of prophetic
   insight into the moral laws of the universe can foretell what will
   happen. The religious community which deems itself first will gradually
   fall behind in gifts and graces, and some other religious community
   which it despises will gradually advance onward, till the two have at
   length, in a way manifest to all men, changed places.

   2. There is great danger of degeneracy in the spirit of those who make
   sacrifices for the kingdom of God, when any particular species of
   service has come to be much in demand, and therefore to be held in very
   high esteem. Take, as an example, the endurance of physical tortures
   and of death in times of persecution. It is well known with what a
   furor of admiration martyrs and confessors were regarded in the
   suffering church of the early centuries. Those who suffered martyrdom
   were almost deified by popular enthusiasm: the anniversaries of their
   death -- of their birthdays, [396] as they were called, into the
   eternal world -- were observed with religious solemnity, when their
   doings and sufferings in this world were rehearsed with ardent
   admiration in strains of extravagant eulogy. Even the confessors, who
   had suffered, but not died for Christ, were looked up to as a superior
   order of beings, separated by a wide gulf from the common herd of
   untried Christians. They were saints, they had a halo of glory round
   their heads; they had power with God, and could, it was believed, bind
   or loose with even more authority than the regular ecclesiastical
   authorities. Absolution was eagerly sought for from them by the lapsed;
   admission to their communion was regarded as an open door by which
   sinners might return into the fellowship of the church. They had only
   to say to the erring, ego in peace," and even bishops must receive
   them. Bishops joined with the populace in this idolatrous homage to the
   men who suffered for Christ's sake. They petted and flattered the
   confessors, partly from honest admiration, but party also from policy,
   to Induce others to imitate their example, and to foster the virtue of
   hardihood, so much needed in suffering times.

   This state of feeling in the church was obviously fraught with great
   danger to the souls of those who endured hardship for the truth, as
   tempting them to fanaticism, vanity, spiritual pride, all presumption.
   Nor were they all by any means temptation-proof. Many took all the
   praise thou received as their due, all deemed themselves persons of
   great consequence. The soldiers, who had been flattered by their
   generals to make them brave, began to act as if they were the masters,
   and could write, for example, to one who had been a special offender in
   the extravagance of his eulogies, such a letter as this: "All the
   confessors to Cyprian the bishop: Know that we have granted peace to
   all those of whom you have had an account what they have done: how they
   have behaved since the commission of their crimes; and we would that
   these presents should be by you imparted to the rest of the bishops. We
   wish you to maintain peace with the holy martyrs." [397] Thus was
   fulfilled in those confessors the saying, "Many that are first shall be
   last." First in suffering for the truth and in reputation for sanctity,
   they became last in the judgment of the great Searcher of hearts. They
   gave their bodies to be scourged, maimed, burned, and it profited them
   little or nothing. [398]

   3. The first are in danger of becoming the last when self-denial is
   reduced to a System, and practiced ascetically, not for Christ's sake,
   but for one's own sake. That in respect of the amount of self-denial
   the austere ascetic is entitled to rank first, nobody will deny. But
   his right to rank first in intrinsic spiritual worth, and therefore in
   the divine kingdom, is more open to dispute. Even in respect to the
   fundamental matter of getting rid of self, he may be, not first, but
   last. The self-denial of the ascetic is in a subtle way intense
   self-assertion. True Christian self-sacrifice signifies hardship, loss
   undergone, not for its own sake, but for Christ's sake, and for truth's
   sake, at a time when truth cannot be maintained without sacrifice. But
   the self-sacrifice of the ascetic is not of this kind. It is all
   endured for his own sake, for his own spiritual benefit and credit. He
   practices self-denial after the fashion of a miser, who is a total
   abstainer from all luxuries, and even grudges himself the necessaries
   of life because he has a passion for hoarding. Like the miser, he deems
   himself rich; yet both he and the miser are alike poor: the miser,
   because with all his wealth he cannot part with his coin in exchange
   for enjoyable commodities; the ascetic, because his coins, "good
   works," so called, painful acts of abstinence, are counterfeit, and
   will not pass current m the kingdom of heaven. All his labors to save
   his soul will turn out to be just so much rubbish to be burned up; and
   if he be saved at all, it will be as by fire.

   Recalling now for a moment the three classes of cases in which the
   first are in danger of becoming last, we perceive that the word "many"
   is not an exaggeration. For consider how much of the work done by
   professing Christians belongs to one or other of these categories:
   occasional spasmodic efforts; good works of liberality and
   philanthropy, which are in fashion and in high esteem in the religious
   world; and good works done, not so much from interest in the work, as
   from their reflex bearing on the doer's own religious interests. Many
   are called to work in God's vineyard, and many are actually at work.
   But few are chosen; few are choice workers; few work for God in the
   spirit of the precepts taught by Jesus.

   But though there be few such workers, there are some. Jesus does not
   say all who are first shall be last, and all who are last shall be
   first: His word is many. There are numerous exceptions to the rule in
   both its parts. Not all who bear the heat and burden of the day are
   mercenary and self-righteous. No; the Lord has always had in His
   spiritual vineyard a noble band of workers, who, if there were room for
   boasting in any case, might have boasted on account of the length, the
   arduousness, and the efficiency of their service, yet cherished no
   self-complacent thoughts, nor indulged in any calculations how much
   more they should receive than others. Think of devoted missionaries to
   heathen lands; of heroic reformers like Luther, Calvin, Knox, and
   Latimer; of eminent men of our own day, recently taken from amongst us.
   Can you fancy such men talking like the early laborers in the vineyard?
   Nay, verily! all through life their thoughts of themselves and their
   service were very humble indeed; and at the close of life's day their
   day's work seemed to them a very sorry matter, utterly undeserving of
   the great reward of eternal life. Such first ones shall not be last.

   If there be some first who shall not be last, there are doubtless also
   some last who shall not be first. If it were otherwise; if to be last
   in length of service, in zeal and devotion, gave a man an advantage, it
   would be ruinous to the interests of the kingdom of God. It would, in
   fact, be in effect putting a premium on indolence, and encouraging men
   to stand all the day idle, or to serve the devil till the eleventh
   hour; and then in old age to enter the vineyard, and give the Lord the
   poor hour's work, when their limbs were stiff and their frames feeble
   and tottering. No such demoralizing law obtains in the divine kingdom.
   Other things being equal, the longer and the more earnestly a man
   serves God, the sooner he begins, and the harder he works, the better
   for himself hereafter. If those who begin late in the day are
   graciously treated, it is in spite, not in consequence, of their
   tardiness. That they have been so long idle is not a commendation, but
   a sin; not a subject of self-congratulation, but of deep humiliation.
   If it be wrong for those who have served the Lord much to glory in the
   greatness of their service, it is surely still more unbecoming, even
   ridiculous, for any one to pride himself in the littleness of his. If
   the first has no cause for boasting and self-righteousness, still less
   has the last.

17. THE SONS OF ZEBEDEE AGAIN;

  OR, SECOND LESSON ON THE DOCTRINE OF THE CROSS

    Matt. 20:17-28; Mark 10:32-45; Luke 18:31-34.

   The incident recorded in these sections of Matthew's and Mark's Gospels
   happened while Jesus and His disciples were going up to Jerusalem for
   the last time, journeying via Jericho, from Ephraim in the wilderness,
   whither they had retired after the raising of Lazarus. [399] The
   ambitious request of the two sons of Zebedee for the chief places of
   honor in the kingdom was therefore made little more than a week before
   their Lord was crucified. How little must they have dreamed what was
   coming! Yet it was not for want of warning; for just before they
   presented their petition, Jesus had for the third time explicitly
   announced His approaching passion, indicating that His death would take
   place in connection with this present visit to Jerusalem, and adding
   other particulars respecting His last sufferings not specified before
   fitted to arrest attention; as that His death should be the issue of a
   judicial process, and that He should be delivered by the Jewish
   authorities to the Gentiles, to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified.
   [400]

   After recording the terms of Christ's third announcement, Luke adds,
   with reference to the disciples: "They understood none of these things;
   and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which
   were spoken." [401] The truth of this statement is sufficiently
   apparent from the scene which ensued, not recorded by Luke, as is also
   the cause of the fact stated. The disciples, we perceive, were thinking
   of other matters while Jesus spake to them of His approaching
   sufferings. They were dreaming of the thrones they had been promised in
   Persia, and therefore were not able to enter into the thoughts of their
   Master, so utterly diverse from their own. Their minds were completely
   possessed by romantic expectations, their heads giddy with the
   sparkling wine of vain hope; and as they drew nigh the holy city their
   firm conviction was, "that the kingdom of God should immediately
   appear." [402]

   While all the disciples were looking forward to their thrones, James
   and John were coveting the most distinguished ones, and contriving a
   scheme for securing these to themselves, and so getting the dispute who
   should be the greatest settled in their own favor. These were the two
   disciples who made themselves so prominent in resenting the rudeness of
   the Samaritan villagers. The greatest zealots among the twelve were
   thus also the most ambitious, a circumstance which will not surprise
   the student of human nature. On the former occasion they asked fire
   from heaven to consume their adversaries; on the present occasion they
   ask a favor from Heaven to the disadvantage of their friends. The two
   requests are not so very dissimilar.

   In hatching and executing their little plot, the two brothers enjoyed
   the assistance of their mother, whose presence is not explained, but
   may have been due to her having become an attendant on Jesus in her
   widowhood, [403] or to an accidental meeting with Him and His disciples
   at the junction of the roads converging on Jerusalem, whither all were
   now going to keep the feast. Salome was the principal actor in the
   scene, and it must be admitted she acted her part well. Kneeling before
   Jesus, as if doing homage to a king, she intimated her humble wish to
   proffer a petition; and being gently asked, "What wilt thou?" said,
   "Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on Thy right hand, and
   the other on the left, in Thy kingdom."

   This prayer had certainly another origin than the inspiration of the
   Holy Ghost, and the scheme of which it was the outcome was not one
   which we should have expected companions of Jesus to entertain. And yet
   the whole proceeding is so true to human nature as it reveals itself in
   every age, that we cannot but feel that we have here no myth, but a
   genuine piece of history. We know how much of the world's

   spirit is to be found at all times in religious circles of high
   reputation for zeal, devotion, and sanctity; and we have no right to
   hold up our hands in amazement when we see it

   appearing even in the immediate neighborhood of Jesus. The twelve were
   yet but crude Christians, and we must allow them time to become
   sanctified as well as others. Therefore we neither affect to be
   scandalized at their conduct, nor, to save their reputation, do we
   conceal its true character. We are not surprised at the behavior of the
   two sons of Zebedee, and yet we say plainly that their request was
   foolish and

   offensive: indicative at once of bold presumption, gross stupidity, and
   unmitigated selfishness.

   It was an irreverent, presumptuous request, because it virtually asked
   Jesus their Lord to become the tool of their ambition and vanity.
   Fancying that He would yield to mere solicitation, perhaps calculating
   that He would not have the heart to refuse a request coming from a
   female suppliant, who as a widow was an object of compassion, and as a
   contributor to His support had claims to His gratitude, they begged a
   favor which Jesus could not grant without being untrue to His own
   character and His habitual teaching, as exemplified in the discourse on
   humility in the house at Capernaum. In so doing they were guilty of a
   disrespectful, impudent forwardness most characteristic of the
   ambitious spirit, which is utterly devoid of delicacy, and pushes on
   towards its end, reckless what offence it may give, heedless how it
   wounds the sensibilities of others.

   The request of the two brothers was as ignorant as it was presumptuous.
   The idea implied therein of the kingdom was utterly wide of truth and
   reality. James and John not only thought of the kingdom that was coming
   as a kingdom of this world, but they thought meanly of it even under
   that view. For it is an unusually corrupt and unwholesome condition of
   matters, even in a secular state, when places of highest distinction
   can be obtained by solicitation and favor, and not on the sole ground
   of fitness for the duties of the position. When family influence or
   courtly arts are the pathway to power, every patriot has cause to
   mourn. How preposterous, then, the idea that promotion can take place
   in the divine, ideally -- perfect kingdom by means that are
   inadmissible in any well -- regulated secular kingdom! To cherish such
   an idea is in effect to degrade and dishonor the Divine King, by
   likening Him to an unprincipled despot, who has more favor for
   flatterers than for honest men; and to caricature the divine kingdom by
   assimilating it to the most misgoverned states on earth, such as those
   ruled over by a Bomba or a Nero.

   The request of the brethren was likewise intensely selfish. It was
   ungenerous as towards their fellow-disciples; for it was an attempt to
   overreach them, and, like all such attempts, produced mischief,
   disturbing the peace of the family circle, and giving rise to a most
   unseemly embitterment of feeling among its members. "When the ten heard
   it, they were moved with indignation." No wonder; and if James and John
   did not anticipate such a result, it showed that they were very much
   taken up with their own selfish thoughts; and if they did anticipate
   it, and nevertheless shrank not from a course of action which was sure
   to give offence, that only made their selfishness the more heartless
   and inexcusable.

   But the petition of the two disciples was selfish in a far wider view,
   viz. with reference to the public interests of the divine kingdom. It
   virtually meant this: "Grant us the places of honor and power, come
   what may; even though universal discontent and disaffection, disorder,
   disaster, and chaotic confusion ensue." These are the sure effects of
   promotion by favor instead of by merit, both in church and in state, as
   many a nation has found to its cost in the day of trial. James and
   John, it is true, never dreamt of disaster resulting from their
   petition being granted. No self-seekers and place-hunters ever do
   anticipate evil results from their promotion. But that does not make
   them less selfish. It only shows that, besides being selfish, they are
   vain.

   The reply of Jesus to this ambitious request, considering its
   character, was singularly mild. Offensive though the presumption,
   forwardness, selfishness, and vanity of the two disciples must have
   been to His meek, holy, self-forgetful spirit, He uttered not a word of
   direct rebuke, but dealt with them as a father might deal with a child
   that had made a senseless request. Abstaining from animadversion on the
   grave faults brought to light by their petition, He noticed only the
   least culpable -- their ignorance. "Ye know not," He said to them
   quietly, "what ye ask;." and even this remark He made in compassion
   rather than in the way of blame. He pitied men who offered prayers
   whose fulfillment, as He knew, implied painful experiences of which
   they had no thought. It was in this spirit that He asked the
   explanatory question: "Are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about
   to drink, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"
   [404]

   But there was more than compassion or correction in this question, even
   instruction concerning the true way of obtaining promotion in the
   kingdom of God. In interrogatory form Jesus taught His disciples that
   advancement in His kingdom went not by favor, nor was obtainable by
   clamorous solicitation; that the way to thrones was the via dolorosa of
   the cross; that the palm-bearers in the realms of glory should be they
   who had passed through great tribulation, and the princes of the
   kingdom they who had drunk most deeply of His cup of sorrow; and that
   for those who refused to drink thereof, the selfish, the
   self-indulgent, the ambitious, the vain, there would be no place at all
   in the kingdom, not to speak of places of honor on His right or left
   hand.

   The startling question put to them by Jesus did not take James and John
   by surprise. Promptly and firmly they replied, "We are able." Had they
   then really taken into account the cup and the baptism of suffering,
   and deliberately made up their minds to pay the costly price for the
   coveted prize? Had the sacred fire of the martyr spirit already been
   kindled in their hearts? One would be happy to think so, but we fear
   there is nothing to justify so favorable an opinion. It is much more
   probable that, in their eagerness to obtain the object of their
   ambition, the two brothers were ready to promise any thing, and that,
   in fact, they neither knew nor cared what they were promising. Their
   confident declaration bears a suspiciously close resemblance to the
   bravado uttered by Peter a few days later: "Though all men shall be
   offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended."

   Jesus, however, did not choose, in the case of the sons of Zebedee, as
   in the case of their friend, to call in question the heroism so
   ostentatiously professed, but adopted the course of assuming that they
   were not only able, but willing, yea, eager, to participate in His
   sufferings. With the air of a king granting to favorites the privilege
   of drinking out of the royal wine-cup, and of washing in the royal
   ewer, He replied: "Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized
   with the baptism that I am baptized with." It was a strange favor which
   the King thus granted! Had they only known the meaning of the words,
   the two brethren might well have fancied that their Master was
   indulging in a stroke of irony at their expense. Yet it was not so.
   Jesus was not mocking His disciples when He spake thus, offering them a
   stone instead of bread: He was speaking seriously, and promising what
   He meant to bestow, and what, when the time of bestowal came -- for it
   did come -- they themselves regarded as a real privilege; for all the
   apostles agreed with Peter that they who were reproached for the name
   of Christ were to be accounted happy, and had the spirit of glory and
   of God resting on them. Such, we believe, was the mind of James when
   Herod killed him with the persecutor's sword: such, we know, was the
   mind of John when he was in the isle of Patmos "for the word of God,
   and for the testimony of Jesus Christ."

   Having promised a favor not coveted by the two disciples, Jesus next
   explained that the favor they did covet was not unconditionally at His
   disposal: "But to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to
   give, save to those for whom it is prepared of my Father." The
   Authorized Version suggests the idea that the bestowal of rewards in
   the kingdom is not in Christ's hands at all. That, however, is not what
   Jesus meant to say; but rather this, that though it is Christ's
   prerogative to assign to citizens their places in His kingdom, it is
   not in His power to dispose of places by partiality and patronage, or
   otherwise than in accordance with fixed principles of justice and the
   sovereign ordination of His Father. The words, paraphrased, signify: "I
   can say to any one, Come, drink of my cup, for there is no risk of
   mischief arising out of favoritism in that direction. But there my
   favors must end. I cannot say to any one, as I please, Come, sit beside
   me on a throne; for each man must get the place prepared for him, and
   for which he is prepared."

   Thus explained, this solemn saying of our Lord furnishes no ground for
   an inference which, on first view, it seems not only to suggest, but to
   necessitate, viz. that one may taste of the cup, yet lose the crown;
   or, at least, that there is no connection between the measure in which
   a disciple may have had fellowship with Christ in His cross, and the
   place which shall be assigned to him in the eternal kingdom. That Jesus
   had no intention to teach such a doctrine is evident from the question
   He had asked just before He made the statement now under consideration,
   which implies a natural sequence between the cup and the throne, the
   suffering and the glory. The sacrifice and the great reward so closely
   conjoined in the promise made to the twelve in Persia are disjoined
   here, merely for the purpose of signalizing the rigor with which all
   corrupt influences are excluded from the kingdom of heaven. It is
   beyond doubt, that those on whom is bestowed in high measure the favor
   of being companions with Jesus in tribulation shall be rewarded with
   high promotion in the eternal kingdom. Nor does this statement
   compromise the sovereignty of the Father and Lord of all; on the
   contrary, it contributes towards its establishment. There is no better
   argument in support of the doctrine of election than the simple truth
   that affliction is the education for heaven. For in what does the
   sovereign hand of God appear more signally than in the appointment of
   crosses? If crosses would let us alone, we would let them alone. We
   choose not the bitter cup and the bloody baptism: we are chosen for
   them, and in them. God impresses men into the warfare of the cross; and
   if any come to glory in this way, as many an impressed soldier has
   done, it will be to glory to which, in the first place at least, they
   did not aspire.

   The asserted connection between suffering and glory serves to defend as
   well as to establish the doctrine of election. Looked at in relation to
   the world to come, that doctrine seems to lay God open to the charge of
   partiality, and is certainly very mysterious. But look at election in
   its bearing on the present life. In that view it is a privilege for
   which the elect are not apt to be envied. For the elect are not the
   happy and the prosperous, but the toilers and sufferers. [405] In fact,
   they are elected not for their own sake, but for the world's sake, to
   be God's pioneers in the rough, unwelcome work of turning the
   wilderness into a fruitful field; to be the world's salt, leaven, and
   light, receiving for the most part little thanks for the service they
   render, and getting often for reward the lot of the destitute, the
   afflicted, and the tormented. So that, after all, election is a favor
   to the non-elect: it is God 's method of benefiting men at large; and
   whatever peculiar benefit may be in store for the elect is well earned,
   and should not be grudged. Does any one envy them their prospect? He
   may be a partaker of their future joy if he be willing to be companion
   to such forlorn beings, and to share their tribulations now.

   It is hardly needful to explain that, in uttering these words, Jesus
   did not mean to deny the utility of prayer, and to say, "You may ask
   for a place in the divine kingdom, and not get it; for all depends on
   what God has ordained." He only wished the two disciples and all to
   understand that to obtain their requests they must know what they ask,
   and accept all that is implied, in the present as well as in the
   future, in the answering of their prayers. This condition is too often
   overlooked. Many a bold, ambitious prayer, even for spiritual blessing,
   is offered up by petitioners who have no idea what the answer would
   involve, and if they had, would wish their prayer unanswered. Crude
   Christians ask, e.g., to be made holy. But do they know what doubts,
   temptations, and sore trials of all kinds go to the making of great
   saints? Others long for a full assurance of God's love; desire to be
   perfectly persuaded of their election. Are they willing to be deprived
   of the sunshine of prosperity, that in the dark night of sorrow they
   may see heaven's stars? Ah me! how few do know what they ask! how much
   all need to be taught to pray for right things with an intelligent mind
   and in a right spirit!

   Having said what was needful to James and John, Jesus next addressed a
   word in season to their brethren inculcating humility; most
   appropriately, for though the ten were the offended party, not
   offenders, yet the same ambitious spirit was in them, else they would
   not have felt and resented the wrong done so keenly. Pride and
   selfishness may vex and grieve the humble and the self-forgetful, but
   they provoke resentment only in the proud and the selfish; and the best
   way to be proof against the assaults of other men's evil passions is to
   get similar affections exorcised out of our own breasts. "Let this mind
   be in you which was also in Christ Jesus;." then shall nothing be done
   by you at least in strife or vainglory.

   "When the ten heard it," we read, "they were moved with indignation
   against the two brethren." Doubtless it was a very unedifying scene
   which ensued; and it is very disappointing to witness such scenes where
   one might have looked to see in perfection the godly spectacle of
   brethren dwelling together in unity. But the society of Jesus was a
   real thing, not the imaginary creation of a romance-writer; and in all
   real human societies, in happy homes, in the most select brotherhoods,
   scientific, literary, or artistic, in Christian churches, there will
   arise tempests now and then. And let us be thankful that the twelve,
   even by their folly, gave their Master an occasion for uttering the
   sublime words here recorded, which shine down upon us out of the serene
   sky of the gospel story like stars appearing through the tempestuous
   clouds of human passion -- manifestly the words of a Divine Being,
   though spoken out of the depths of an amazing self-humiliation.

   The manner of Jesus, in addressing His heated disciples, was very
   tender and subdued. He collected them all around Him, the two and the
   ten, the offenders and the offended, as a father might gather together
   his children to receive admonition, and He spoke to them with the
   calmness and solemnity of one about to meet death. Throughout this
   whole scene death's solemnizing influence is manifestly on the
   Saviour's spirit. For does He not speak of His approaching sufferings
   in language reminding us of the night of His betrayal, describing His
   passion by the poetic sacramental name "my cup," and for the first time
   revealing the secret of His life on earth -- the grand object for which
   He is about to die?

   In moral significance, the doctrine of Jesus at this time was a
   repetition of His teaching in Capernaum, when He chose the little child
   for His text. As He said then, Who would be great must be childlike, so
   He says here, Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your
   minister. In the former discourse His model and His text was an infant;
   now it is a slave, another representative of the mean and despicable.
   Now, as before, He quotes His own example to enforce His precept;
   stimulating His disciples to seek distinction in a path of lowly love
   by representing the Son of man as come not to be ministered unto, but
   to minister, even to the length of giving His life a ransom for the
   many, as He then reminded them, that the Son of man came like a
   shepherd, to seek and to save the lost sheep.

   The single new feature in the lesson which Jesus gave His disciples at
   this season is, the contrast between His kingdom and the kingdoms of
   earth in respect to the mode of acquiring dominion, to which He
   directed attention, by way of preface, to the doctrine about to be
   communicated. "Ye know," He said, "that the princes of the Gentiles
   exercise dominion over them, and they that are great (provincial
   governors, often more tyrannical than their superiors) exercise
   authority upon them. But it shall not be so among you." There is a hint
   here at another contrast besides the one mainly intended, viz. that
   between the harsh despotic sway of worldly potentates, and the gentle
   dominion of love alone admissible in the divine kingdom. But the main
   object of the words quoted is to point out the difference in the way of
   acquiring rather than in the manner of using power. The idea is this:
   earthly kingdoms are ruled by a class of persons who possess hereditary
   rank -- the aristocracy, nobles, or princes. The governing class are
   those whose birthright it is to rule, and whose boast it is never to
   have been in a servile position, but always to have been served. In my
   kingdom, on the other hand, a man becomes a great one, and a ruler, by
   being first the servant of those over whom he is to bear rule. In other
   states, they rule whose privilege it is to be ministered unto; in the
   divine commonwealth, they rule who account it a privilege to minister.

   In drawing this contrast, Jesus had, of course, no intention to teach
   politics; no intention either to recognize or to call in question the
   divine right of the princely cast to rule over their fellow-creatures.
   He spoke of things as they were, and as His hearers knew them to be in
   secular states, and especially in the Roman Empire. If any political
   inference might be drawn from His words, it would not be in favor of
   absolutism and hereditary privilege, but rather in favor of power being
   in the hands of those who have earned it by faithful service, whether
   they belong to the governing class by birth or not. For what is
   beneficial in the divine kingdom cannot be prejudicial to secular
   commonwealths. The true interests, one would say, of an earthly kingdom
   should be promoted by its being governed as nearly as possible in
   accordance with the laws of the kingdom which cannot be moved. Thrones
   and crowns may, to prevent disputes, go by hereditary succession,
   irrespective of personal merit; but the reality of power should ever be
   in the hands of the ablest, the wisest, and the most devoted to the
   public good.

   Having explained by contrast the great principle of the spiritual
   commonwealth, that he who would rule therein must first serve, Jesus
   proceeded next to enforce the doctrine by a reference to His own
   example. "Whosoever will be chief among you," said He to the twelve,
   "let him be your servant;." and then He added the memorable words:
   "Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
   minister, and to give His life a ransom for many."

   These words were spoken by Jesus as one who claimed to be a king, and
   aspired to be the first in a great and mighty kingdom. At the end of
   the sentence we must mentally supply the clause -- which was not
   expressed simply because it was so obviously implied in the connection
   of thought -- "so seeking to win a kingdom." Our Lord sets Himself
   forth here not merely as an example of humility, but as one whose case
   illustrates the truth that the way to power in the spiritual world is
   service; and in stating that He came not to be ministered unto, but to
   minister, He expresses not the whole truth, but only the present fact.
   The whole truth was, that He came to minister in the first place, that
   He might be ministered to in turn by a willing, devoted people,
   acknowledging Him as their sovereign. The point on which He wishes to
   fix the attention of His disciples is the peculiar way He takes to get
   His crown; and what He says in effect is this: "I am a King, and I
   expect to have a kingdom; James and John were not mistaken in that
   respect. But I shall obtain my kingdom in another way than secular
   princes get theirs. They get their thrones by succession, I get mine by
   personal merit; they secure their kingdom by right of birth, I hope to
   secure mine by the right of service; they inherit their subjects, I buy
   mine, the purchase-money being mine own life."

   What the twelve thought of this novel plan of getting dominion and a
   kingdom, and especially what ideas the concluding word of their Master
   suggested to their minds when uttered, we know not. We are sure,
   however, that they did not comprehend that word; and no marvel, for the
   thought of Jesus was very deep. Who can understand it fully even now?
   Here we emphatically see through a glass, in enigmas.

   This memorable saying has been the subject of much doubtful disputation
   among theologians, nor can we hope by any thing that we can say to
   terminate controversy. The word is a deep well which has never yet been
   fathomed, and probably never will. Brought in so quietly as an
   illustration to enforce a moral precept, it opens up a region of
   thought which takes us far beyond the immediate occasion of its being
   uttered. It raises questions in our minds which it does not solve; and
   yet there is little in the New Testament on the subject of Christ's
   death which might not be comprehended within the limits of its possible
   significance.

   First of all, let us say that we have no sympathy with that school of
   critical theologians who call in question the authenticity of this
   word. [406] It is strange to observe how unwilling some are to
   recognize Christ as the original source of great thoughts which have
   become essential elements in the faith of the church. This idea of
   Christ's death as a ransom is here now. With whom did it take its rise?
   was the mind of Jesus not original enough to conceive it, that it must
   be fathered on some one else? Another thing has to be considered in
   connection with this saying, and the kindred one uttered at the
   institution of the supper. After Jesus had begun to dwell much in
   thought, accompanied with deep emotion, on the fact that He must die,
   it was inevitable that His mind should address itself to the task of
   investing the harsh, prosaic fact with poetic, mystic meanings. We
   speak of Jesus for the moment simply as a man of wonderful spiritual
   genius, whose mind was able to cope with death, and rob it of its
   character of a mere fate, and invest it with beauty, and clothe the
   skeleton with the flesh and blood of an attractive system of spiritual
   meanings.

   Regarding, then, this precious saying as unquestionably authentic, what
   did Christ mean to teach by it? First this, at least, in general, that
   there was a causal connection between His act in laying down His life
   and the desired result, viz. spiritual sovereignty. And without having
   any regard to the term ransom, even supposing it for the moment absent
   from the text, we can see for ourselves that there is such a
   connection. However original the method adopted by Jesus for getting a
   kingdom -- and when compared with other methods of getting kingdoms,
   e.g. by inheritance, the most respectable way, or by the sword, or,
   basest of all, by paying down a sum of money, as in the last days of
   the Roman Empire, its originality is beyond dispute -- however original
   the method of Jesus, it has proved strangely successful. The event has
   proved that there must be a connection between the two things, -- the
   death on the cross and the sovereignty of souls. Thousands of human
   beings, yea, millions, in every age, have said Amen with all their
   hearts to the doxology of John in the Apocalypse: "Unto Him that loved
   us and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and hath made us kings
   and priests unto God and His Father, unto Him be glory and dominion
   forever." Without doubt this result of His self-devotion was present to
   the mind of Jesus when He uttered the words before us, and in uttering
   them He meant for one thing to emphasize the power of divine love in
   self-sacrifice, to assert its sway over human hearts, and to win for
   the King of the sacred commonwealth a kind of sovereignty not
   attainable otherwise than by humbling Himself to take upon Him the form
   of a servant. Some assert that to gain this power was the sole end of
   the Incarnation. We do not agree with this view, but we have no
   hesitation in regarding the attainment of such moral power by
   self-sacrifice as one end of the Incarnation. The Son of God wished to
   charm us away from self-indulgence and self-worship, to emancipate us
   from sin's bondage by the power of His love, that we might acknowledge
   ourselves to be His, and devote ourselves gratefully to His services.

   But there is more in the text than we have yet found, for Jesus says
   not merely that He is to lay down His life for the many, but that He is
   to lay down His life in the form of a ransom. The question is, what are
   we to understand by this form in which the fact of death is expressed?
   Now it may be assumed that the word "ransom" was used by Jesus in a
   sense having affinity to Old Testament usage. The Greek word (lutron)
   is employed in the Septuagint as the equivalent for the Hebrew word
   copher (kphr), about whose meaning there has been much discussion, but
   the general sense of which is a covering. How the idea of covering is
   to be taken, whether in the sense of shielding, or in the sense of
   exactly covering the same surface, as one penny covers another, i.e. as
   an equivalent, has been disputed, and must remain doubtful. [407] The
   theological interest of the question is this, that if we accept the
   word in the general sense of protection, then the ransom is not offered
   or accepted as a legal equivalent for the persons or things redeemed,
   but simply as something of a certain value which is received as a
   matter of favor. But leaving this point on one side, what we are
   concerned with in connection with this text is the broader thought that
   Christ's life is given and accepted for the lives of many, whether as
   an exact equivalent or otherwise being left indeterminate. Jesus
   represents His death voluntarily endured as a means of delivering from
   death the souls of the many; how or why does not clearly appear. A
   German theologian, who energetically combats the Anselmian theory of
   satisfaction, finds in the word these three thoughts: First, the ransom
   is offered as a gift to God, not to the devil. Jesus, having
   undoubtedly the train of thought in Psalm xlix. in His mind, speaks of
   devoting His life to God in the pursuit of His vocation, not of
   subjecting Himself to the might of sin or of the devil. Second, Jesus
   not only presupposes that no man can offer either for himself or for
   others a valuable gift capable of warding off death unto God, as the
   Psalmist declares; but He asserts that in this view He Himself renders
   a service in the place of many which no one of them could render either
   for himself or for another. Third, Jesus, having in mind also,
   doubtless, the words of Elihu in the Book of Job concerning an angel,
   one of a thousand, who may avail to ransom a man from death,
   distinguishes Himself from the mass of men liable to death in so far as
   He regards Himself as excepted from the natural doom of death, and
   conceives of His death as a voluntary act by which He surrenders His
   life to God, as in the text John x. 17, 18. [408] In taking so much out
   of the saying we do not subject it to undue straining. The assumption
   that there is a mental reference to the Old Testament texts in the
   forty-ninth Psalm and in the thirty-third chapter of Job, as also to
   the redemption of the males among the children of Israel by the payment
   of a half-shekel, seems reasonable; and in the light of these passages
   it does not seem going too far to take out of our Lord's words these
   three ideas: The ransom is given to God (Psalm xlix. 7: "Nor give to
   God a ransom for him"); it is given for the lives of men doomed to die;
   and it is available for such a purpose because the thing given is the
   life of an exceptional being, one among a thousand, not a brother
   mortal doomed to die, but an angel assuming flesh that He may freely
   die. Thus the text contains, besides the general truth that by dying in
   self-sacrificing love the Son of man awakens in the many a sense of
   grateful devotion that carries Him to a throne, this more special one,
   that by His death He puts the many doomed to death as the penalty of
   sin somehow in a different relation to God, so that they are no longer
   criminals, but sons of God, heirs of eternal life, members of the holy
   commonwealth, enjoying all its privileges, redeemed by the life of the
   King Himself, as the half-shekel offered as the price of redemption.

   These few hints must suffice as an indication of the probable meaning
   of the autobiographical saying in which Jesus conveyed to His disciples
   their second lesson on the doctrine of the cross. [409] With two
   additional reflections thereon we end this chapter. When He said of
   Himself that He came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, Jesus
   alluded not merely to His death, but to His whole life. The statement
   is an epitome in a single sentence of His entire earthly history. The
   reference to His death has the force of a superlative. He came to
   minister, even to the extent of giving His life a ransom. Then this
   saying, while breathing the spirit of utter lowliness, at the same time
   betrays the consciousness of superhuman dignity. Had Jesus not been
   more than man, His language would not have been humble, but
   presumptuous. Why should the son of a carpenter say of Himself, I came
   not to be ministered unto? servile position and occupation was a matter
   of course for such an one. The statement before us is rational and
   humble, only as coming from one who, being in the form of God, freely
   assumed the form of a servant, and became obedient unto death for our
   salvation.

18. THE ANOINTING IN BETHANY;

  OR, THIRD LESSON ON THE DOCTRINE OF THE CROSS

    Matt. 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8.

   The touching story of the anointing of Jesus by Mary at Bethany forms
   part of the preface to the history of the passion, as recorded in the
   synoptical Gospels. That preface, as given most fully by Matthew,
   includes four particulars: first, a statement made by Jesus to His
   disciples two days before the pass over concerning His betrayal;
   second, a meeting of the priests in Jerusalem to consult when and how
   Jesus should be put to death; third, the anointing by Mary; fourth, the
   secret correspondence between Judas and the priests. In Mark's preface
   the first of these four particulars is omitted; in Luke's both the
   first and the third.

   The four facts related by the first evangelist had this in common, that
   they were all signs that the end so often foretold was at length at
   hand. Jesus now says, not "the Son of man shall be betrayed," but "the
   Son of man is betrayed to be crucified." The ecclesiastical authorities
   of Israel are assembled in solemn conclave, not to discuss the question
   what should be done with the object of their dislike -- that is already
   determined -- but how the deed of darkness may be done most stealthily
   and most securely. The Victim has been anointed by a friendly hand for
   the approaching sacrifice. And, finally, an instrument has been found
   to relieve the priests from their perplexity, and to pave the way in a
   most unexpected manner for the consummation of their wicked purpose.

   The grouping of the incidents in the introduction to the tragic history
   of the crucifixion is strikingly dramatic in its effect. First comes
   the Sanhedrim in Jerusalem plotting against the life of the Just One.
   Then comes Mary at Bethany, in her unutterable love breaking her
   alabaster box, and pouring its contents on the head and feet of her
   beloved Lord. Last comes Judas, offering to sell his Master for less
   than Mary wasted on a useless act of affection! Hatred and baseness on
   either hand, and true love in the midst. [410]

   This memorable transaction of Mary with her alabaster box belongs to
   the history of the passion, in virtue of the interpretation put upon it
   by Jesus, which gives to it the character of a Iyric prelude to the
   great tragedy enacted on Calvary. It belongs to the history of the
   twelve disciples, because of the unfavorable construction which they
   put on it. All the disciples, it seems, disapproved of the action, the
   only difference between Judas and the rest being that he disapproved on
   hypocritical grounds, while his fellow-disciples were honest both in
   their judgment and in their motives. By their fault-finding the twelve
   rendered to Mary a good service. They secured for her a present
   defender in Jesus, and future eulogists in themselves. Their censure
   drew from the Lord the extraordinary statement, that wheresoever the
   gospel might be preached in the whole world, what Mary had done would
   be spoken of for a memorial of her. This prophecy the fault-finding
   disciples, when they became apostles, helped to fulfill. They felt
   bound by the virtual commandment of their Master, as well as by the
   generous redaction of their own hearts, to make amends to Mary for
   former wrong done, by telling the tale of her true love to Jesus
   wherever they told the story of His true love to men. From their lips
   the touching narrative passed in due course into the gospel records, to
   be read with a thrill of delight by true Christians to the end of time.
   Verily one might be content to be spoken against for a season for tulle
   sake of such chivalrous championship as that of Jesus, and such
   magnanimous recantations as those of His apostles!

   When we consider from whom Mary's defense proceeds, we must be
   satisfied that it was not merely generous, but just. And yet surely it
   is a defense of a most surprising character! Verily it seems as if,
   while the disciples went to one extreme in blaming, their Lord went to
   the other extreme in praising; as if, in so lauding the woman of
   Bethany, He were but repeating her extravagance in another form. You
   feel tempted to ask: Was her action, then, so preeminently meritorious
   as to deserve to be associated with the gospel throughout all time?
   Then, as to the explanation of the action given by Jesus, the further
   questions suggest themselves: Was there really any reference in Mary's
   mind to His death and burial while she was performing it? Does not
   Jesus rather impute to her His own feeling, and invest her act with an
   ideal poetic significance, which lay not in it, b.lt in His own
   thoughts? And if so, can we endorse the judgment He pronounced; or must
   we, on the question as to the intrinsic merit of Mary's act, give our
   vote on the side of the twelve against their Master?

   We, for our part, cordially take Christ's side of the question; and in
   doing so, we can afford to make two admissions. In the first place, we
   admit that Mary had no thought of embalming, in the literal sense, the
   dead body of Jesus, and possibly was not thinking of His death at all
   when she anointed Him with the precious ointment. Her action was simply
   a festive honor done to one whom she loved unspeakably, and which she
   might have rendered at another time. [411] We admit further, that it
   would certainly have been an extravagance to speak of Mary's deed,
   however noble, as entitled to be associated with the gospel everywhere
   and throughout all time, unless it were fit to be spoken of not merely
   for her sake, but more especially for the gospel's sake; that is to
   say, unless it were capable of being made use of to expound the nature
   of the gospel. In other words, the breaking of the alabaster box must
   be worthy to be employed as an emblem of the deed of love performed by
   Jesus in dying on the cross.

   Such, indeed, we believe it to be. Wherever the gospel is truly
   preached, the story of the anointing is sure to be prized as the best
   possible illustration of the spirit which moved Jesus to lay down His
   life, as also of the spirit of Christianity as it manifests itself in
   the lives of sincere believers. The breaking of the alabaster box is a
   beautiful symbol at once of Christ's love to us and of the love we owe
   to Him. As Mary broke her box of ointment and poured forth its precious
   contents, so Christ broke His body and shed His precious blood; so
   Christians pour forth their hearts before their Lord, counting not
   their very lives dear for His sake. Christ's death was a breaking of an
   alabaster box for us; our life should be a breaking of an alabaster box
   for Him.

   This relation of spiritual affinity between the deed of Mary and His
   own deed in dying is the true key to all that is enigmatical in the
   language of Jesus in speaking of the former. It explains, for example,
   the remarkable manner in which He referred to the gospel in connection
   therewith. "This gospel," He said, as if it had been already spoken of;
   nay, as if the act of anointing were the gospel. And so it was in a
   figure. The one act already done by Mary naturally suggested to the
   mind of Jesus the other act about to be done by Himself. "There," He
   thought within Himself, "in that broken vessel and outpoured oil is my
   death foreshadowed; in the hidden motive from which that deed proceeded
   is the eternal spirit in which I offer myself a sacrifice revealed."
   This thought He meant to express when He used the phrase "this
   gospel;." and in putting such a construction on Mary's deed He was in
   effect giving His disciples their third lesson on the doctrine of the
   cross.

   In the light of this same relation of spiritual affinity, we clearly
   perceive the true meaning of the statement made by Jesus concerning
   Mary's act: "In that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
   it for my burial." It was a mystic, poetic explanation of a most poetic
   deed, and as such was not only beautiful, but true. For the anointing
   in Bethany has helped to preserve, to embalm so to speak, the true
   meaning of the Saviors death. It has supplied us with a symbolic act
   through which to understand that death; it has shed around the cross an
   imperishable aroma of self forgetting love; it has decked the Saviors
   grave with flowers that never shall wither, and reared for Jesus, as
   well as for Mary, a memorial-stone that shall endure throughout all
   generations. Might it not be fitly said of such a deed, She did it for
   my burial? Was it not most unfitly said of a deed capable of rendering
   so important a service to the gospel, that it was wasteful and useless?

   These questions will be answered in the affirmative by all who are
   convinced that the spiritual affinity asserted by us really did exist.
   What we have now to do, therefore, is to show, by going a little into
   detail, that our assertion is well founded.

   There are three outstanding points of resemblance between Mary's "good
   work" in anointing Jesus, and the good work wrought by Jesus Himself in
   dying on the cross.

   There was first a resemblance in motive. Mary wrought her good work out
   of pure love. She loved Jesus with her whole heart, for what He was,
   for what He had done for the family to which she belonged, and for the
   words of instruction she had heard from His lips when He came on a
   visit to their house. There was such a love in her heart for her friend
   and benefactor as imperatively demanded expression, and yet could not
   find expression in words. She must do something to relieve her pent-up
   emotions: she must get an alabaster box and break it, and pour it on
   the person of Jesus, else her heart will break.

   Herein Mary's act resembles closely that of Jesus in dying on the
   cross, and in coming to this world that He might die. For just such a
   love as that of Mary, only far deeper and stronger, moved Him to
   sacrifice Himself for us. The simple account of Christ's whole conduct
   in becoming man, and undergoing what is recorded of Him, is this: He
   loved sinners. After wearying themselves in studying the philosophy of
   redemption, learned theologians come back to this as the most
   satisfactory explanation that can be given. Jesus so loved sinners as
   to lay down His life for them; nay, we might almost say, He so loved
   them that He must needs come and die for them. Like Nehemiah, the
   Jewish patriot in the court of the Persian king, He could not stay in
   heaven's court while His brethren far away on earth were in an evil
   case; He must ask and obtain leave to go down to their assistance.
   [412] Or, like Mary, He must procure an alabaster box -- a human body
   -- fill it with the fine essence of a human soul, and pour out His soul
   unto death on the cross for our salvation. The spirit of Jesus, yea,
   the spirit ox the Eternal God, is the spirit of Mary and of Nehemiah,
   and of all who are likeminded with them. In reverence we ought rather
   to say, the spirit of such is the spirit of Jesus and of God; and yet
   it is needful at times to put the matter in the inverse way. For
   somehow we are slow to believe that love is a reality for God. We
   almost shrink, as if it were an impiety, from ascribing to the Divine
   Being attributes which we confess to be the noblest and most heroic in
   human character. Hence the practical value of the sanction here given
   by Jesus to the association of the anointing in Bethany with the
   crucifixion on Calvary. He, in effect, says to us thereby: Be not
   afraid to regard my death as an act of the same kind as that of Mary:
   an act of pure, devoted love. Let the aroma of her ointment circulate
   about the neighborhood of my cross, and help you to discern the sweet
   savor of my sacrifice. Amid all your speculations and theories on the
   grand theme of redemption, take heed that ye fail not to see in my
   death my loving heart, and the loving heart of my Father, revealed.
   [413]

   Mary's "good work" further resembled Christ's in its self-sacrificing
   character. It was not without an effort and a sacrifice that that
   devoted woman performed her famous act of homage. All the evangelists
   make particular mention of the costliness of the ointment. Mark and
   John represent the murmuring disciples as estimating its value at the
   round sum of three hundred pence; equal, say, to the wages of a
   laboring man for a whole year at the then current rate of a deniers per
   day. This was a large sum in itself; but what is more particularly to
   be noted, it was a very large sum for Mary. This we learn from Christ's
   own words, as recorded by the second evangelist. "She hath done what
   she could," He kindly remarked of her, in defending her conduct against
   the harsh censures of His disciples. It was a remark of the same kind
   as that which He made a day or two after in Jerusalem concerning the
   poor widow whom He saw casting two mites into the temple treasury; and
   it implied that Mary had expended all her resources on that singular
   tribute of respect to Him whom her soul loved. All her earnings, all
   her little hoard, had been given in exchange for that box, whose
   precious contents she poured on the Saviors person. Hers was no
   ordinary love: it was a noble, heroic, self sacrificing devotion, which
   made her do her utmost for its object.

   Herein the woman of Bethany resembled the Son of man. He, too, did what
   He could. Whatever it was possible for a holy being to endure in the
   way of humiliation, temptation, sorrow, suffering, yea, even in the way
   of becoming "sin" and "a curse," He willingly underwent. All through
   His life on earth He scrupulously abstained from doing aught that might
   tend to make his cup of affliction come short of absolute fullness. He
   denied ~limself all the advantages of divine power and privilege; He
   emptied Himself; He made Himself poor; He became in all possible
   respects like His sinful brethren, that He might qualify Himself for
   being a merciful and trustworthy High Yriest to them in things
   pertaining to God. Such sacrifices in life and death did His love
   impose on Him.

   While imposing sacrifices, love, by way of compensation, makes them
   easy. It is not only love's destiny, but it is love's delight, to
   endure hardships, to bear burdens for the object loved. It is not
   satisfied till it has found an opportunity of embodying itself in a
   service involving cost, labor, pain. The things from which selfishness
   shrinks love ardently longs for. These reflections, we believe, are
   applicable to Mary. With her love to Jesus, it was more easy for her to
   do what she did than to refrain from doing it. But love's readiness and
   eagerness to sacrifice herself are most signally exemplified in the
   case of Jesus Himself. It was indeed His pleasure to suffer for our
   redemption. Far from shrinking from the cross, He looked forward to it
   with earnest desire; and when the hour of His passion approached, He
   spoke of it as the hour of His glorification. He had no thought of
   achieving our salvation at the smallest possible cost to Himself. His
   feeling was rather akin to this: "The more I suffer the better: the
   more thoroughly shall I realize my identity with my brethren; the more
   completely will the sympathetic, burden-bearing, help-bringing
   instincts and yearnings of my love be satisfied." Yes: Jesus had more
   to do than to purchase sinners for as small a price as would be
   accepted for their ransom. He had to do justice to His own heart; He
   had adequately to express its deep compassion; and no act of limited or
   calculated dimensions would avail to exhaust the contents of that whose
   dimensions were immeasurable. Measured suffering, especially when
   endured by so august a personage, might satisfy divine justice, but it
   could not satisfy divine love.

   A third feature which fitted Mary's "good work" to be an emblem of the
   Saviors, was its magnificence. This also appeared in the expenditure
   connected with the act of anointing, which was not only such as
   involved a sacrifice for a person of her means, but very liberal with
   reference to the purpose in hand. The quantity of oil employed in the
   service was, according to John, not less than a pound weight. This was
   much more than could be said to be necessary. There was an appearance
   of waste and extravagance in the manner of the anointing, even
   admitting the thing in itself to be right and proper. Whether the
   disciples would have objected to the ceremony, however performed, does
   not appear; but it was evidently the extravagant amount of ointment
   expended which was the prominent object of their displeasure. We
   conceive them as saying in effect: "Surely less might have done; the
   greater part at least, if not the whole of this ointment, might have
   been saved for other uses. This is simply senseless, prodigal
   expenditure."

   What to the narrow-hearted disciples seemed prodigality was but the
   princely magnificence of love, which, as even a heathen philosopher
   could tell, considers not for how much or how little this or that can
   be done, but how it can be done most gracefully and handsomely. [414]
   And what seemed to them purposeless waste served at least one good
   purpose. It symbolized a similar characteristic of Christ's good work
   as the Saviour of sinners. He did His work magnificently, and in no
   mean, economical way. He accomplished the redemption of "many" by means
   adequate to redeem all. "With Him is plenteous redemption." He did not
   measure out His blood in proportion to the number to be saved, nor
   limit His sympathies as the sinner's friend to the elect. He shed
   bitter tears for doomed souls; He shed His blood without measure, and
   without respect to numbers, and offered an atonement which was
   sufficient for the sins of the world. Nor was this attribute of
   universal sufficiency attaching to His atoning work one to which He was
   indifferent. On the contrary, it appears to have been in His thoughts
   at the very moment He uttered the words authorizing the association of
   Mary's deed of love with the gospel. For He speaks of that gospel,
   which was to consist in the proclamation of His deed of love in dying
   for sinners, as a gospel for the whole world; evidently desiring that,
   as the odor of Mary's ointment filled the room in which the guests were
   assembled, so the aroma of His sacrifice might be diffused as an
   atmosphere of saving health among all the nations.

   We may say, therefore, that in defending Mary against the charge of
   waste, Jesus was at the same time defending Himself; replying by
   anticipation to such questions as these: To what purpose weep over
   doomed Jerusalem? why sorrow for souls that are after all to perish?
   why trouble Himself about men not elected to salvation? why command His
   gospel to be preached to every creature, with an emphasis which seems
   to say He wishes every one saved, when He knows only a definite number
   will believe the report? why not confine His sympathies and His
   solicitudes to those who shall be effectually benefited by them? why
   not restrict His love to the channel of the covenant? why allow it to
   overflow the embankments like a river in full flood? [415]

   Such questions betray ignorance of the conditions under which even the
   elect are saved. Christ could not save any unless He were heartily
   willing to save all, for that willingness is a part of the perfect
   righteousness which it beloved Him to fulfill. The sum of duty is, Love
   God supremely, and thy neighbor as thyself; and "neighbor" means, for
   Christ as for us, every one who needs help, and whom He can help. But
   not to dwell on this, we remark that such questions show ignorance of
   the nature of love. Magnify. pence, misnamed by churls extravagance and
   waste, is an invariable attribute of all true love. David recognized
   this truth when he selected the profuse anointing of Aaron with the oil
   of consecration at his installation into the office of high priest as a
   fit emblem of brotherly love. [416] There was "waste" in that anointing
   too, as well as in the one which took place at Bethany. For the oil was
   not sprinkled on the head of Aaron, though that might have been
   sufficient for the purpose of a mere ceremony. The vessel was emptied
   on the high priest's person, so that its contents flowed down from the
   head upon the beard, and even to the skirts of the sacerdotal robes. In
   that very waste lay the point of the resemblance for David. It was a
   feature that was likely to strike his mind, for he, too, was a wasteful
   man in his way. He had loved God in a manner which exposed him to the
   charge of extravagance. He had danced before the Lord, for example,
   when the ark was brought up from the house ox Obed-edom to Jerusalem,
   forgetful of his dignity, exceeding the bounds of decorum, and, as it
   might seem, without excuse, as a much less hearty demonstration of his
   feelings would have served the purpose of a religious solemnity. [417]

   David, Mary, Jesus, all loving, devoted beings, prophets, apostles,
   martyrs, confessors, belong to one company, and come all under one
   condemnation. They must all plead guilty to a waste of affection,
   sorrow, labor, tears; all live so as to earn for themselves the blame
   of extravagance, which is their highest praise. David dances, and
   Michal sneers; prophets break their hearts for their people's sins and
   miseries, and the people make sport of their grief; Marys break their
   alabaster boxes, and frigid disciples object to the waste; men of God
   sacrifice their all for their religious convictions, and the world
   calls them fools for their pains, and philosophers bid them beware of
   being martyrs by mistake; Jesus weeps over sinners that will not come
   to Him to be saved, and thankless men ask, Why shed tears over vessels
   of wrath fitted for destruction?

   We have thus seen that Mary's good deed was a fit and worthy emblem of
   the good deed of Jesus Christ in dying on the cross. We are now to show
   that Mary herself is in some important respects worthy to be spoken of
   as a model Christian. Three features in her character entitle her to
   this honorable name.

   First among these is her enthusiastic attachment to the person of
   Christ. The most prominent feature in Mary's character was her power of
   loving, her capacity of self devotion. It was this virtue, as
   manifested in her action, that elicited the admiration of Jesus. He was
   so delighted with the chivalrous deed of love, that He, so to speak,
   canonized Mary on the spot, as a king might confer knighthood on the
   battlefield on a soldier who had performed some noble feat of arms.
   "Behold," He said in effect, "here is what I understand by
   Christianity: an unselfish and uncalculating devotion to me as the
   Saviour of sinners, and as the Sovereign of the kingdom of truth and
   righteousness. Therefore, wherever the gospel is preached, let this
   that this woman heath done be spoken of, not merely as a memorial of
   her, but to intimate what I expect of all who believe in me."

   In so commending Mary, Jesus gives us to understand in effect that
   devotion is the chief of Christian virtues. He proclaims the same
   doctrine afterwards taught by one who, though last, was the first of
   all the apostles in his comprehension of the mind of Christ -- the
   Apostle Paul. That glowing panegyric on charity, so well known to all
   readers of his epistles, in which he makes eloquence, knowledge, faith,
   the gift of tongues, and the gift of prophecy, do obeisance to her, as
   the sovereign virtue, is but the faithful interpretation in general
   terms of the encomium pronounced on the woman of Beth any. The story of
   the anointing and the thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the
   Corinthians may be read with advantage together.

   In making love the test and measure of excellence, Jesus and Paul, and
   the rest of the apostles (for they all shared the Master's mind at
   last), differ widely from the world religious and orologies. Pharisees
   and Sadducees, scrupulous religionists, and unscrupulous men of no
   religion, agree in disliking ardent, enthusiastic, chivalrous devotion,
   even in the most noble cause. They are wise and prudent, and their
   philosophy might be embodied in such maxims as these: "Be not too
   catholic in your sentiments, too warm in your sympathies, too keen in
   your sense of duty; never allow your heart to get the better of your
   head, or your principles to interfere with your interest." So widely
   diffused is the dislike to earnestness, especially in good, that all
   nations have their proverbs against enthusiasm. The Greeks had their
   meden agan, the Latins their Ne quid nimis; [418] expressing skepticism
   in proverb-maker and proverb-quoter as to the possibility of wisdom
   being enthusiastic about any thing. The world is prosaic, not poetic,
   in temperament -- prudential, not impulsive: it abhors eccentricity in
   good or in evil; it prefers a dead level of mediocrity, moderation, and
   self-possession; its model man is one who never forgets himself, either
   by sinking below himself in folly or wickedness, or by rising above
   himself, and getting rid of meanness, pride, selfishness, cowardice,
   and vanity in devotion to a noble cause.

   The twelve were like the world in their temperament at the time of the
   anointing: they seem to have regarded Mary as a romantic, quixotic,
   crazy creature, and her action as absurd and indefensible. They
   objected not, of course, to her love of Jesus; but they deemed the
   manner of its manifestation foolish, as the money spent on the ointment
   might have been applied to a better purpose -- say, to the relief of
   the destitute -- and Jesus loved nothing the less, seeing that,
   according to His own teaching, all philanthropic actions were deeds of
   kindness to Himself. And, on first thoughts, one is half inclined to
   say that they had reason on their side, and were far wiser, while not
   less devoted to Jesus than Mary. But look at their behavior on the day
   of their Lord's crucifixion, and learn the difference between them and
   her. Mary loved so ardently as to be beyond calculations of
   consequences or expenses; they loved so coldly, that there was room for
   fear in their hearts: therefore, while Mary spent her all on the
   ointment, they all forsook their Master, and fled to save their own
   wives. Whence we can see that, despite occasional extravagances,
   apparent or real, that spirit is wisest as well as noblest which makes
   us incapable of calculation, and proof against temptations arising
   therefrom. One rash, blundering, but heroic Luther is worth a thousand
   men of the Erasmus type, unspeakably wise, but cold, passionless,
   timid, and time-serving. Scholarship is great, but action is greater;
   and the power to do noble actions comes from love.

   How great is the devoted Mary compared with the coldhearted disciples!
   She does noble deeds, and they criticize them. Poor work for a human
   being, criticism, especially the sort that abounds in fault-finding!
   Love does not care for such occupation; it is too petty for her
   generous mind. If there be room for praise, she will give that in
   unstinted measure; but rather than carp and blame, she prefers to be
   silent. Then observe again how love in Mary becomes a substitute for
   prescience. She does not know that Jesus is about to die, but she acts
   as if she did. Such as Mary can divine; the instincts of love, the
   inspiration of the God of love, teach them to do the right thing at the
   right time, which is the very highest attainment of true wisdom. On the
   other hand, we see in the case of the disciples how coldness of heart
   consumes knowledge and makes men stupid. They had received far more
   information than Mary concerning the future. If they did not know that
   Jesus was about to be put to death, they ought to have known from the
   many hints and even plain intimations which had been given them. But,
   alas! they had forgot all these. And why? For the same reason which
   makes all men so forgetful of things pertaining to their neighbors. The
   twelve were too much taken up with their own affairs. Their heads were
   filled with vain dreams of worldly ambition, and so their Master's
   words were forgotten almost as soon as they were uttered, and it became
   needful that He should tell them pathetically and reproachfully: "The
   poor ye have always with you, but me ye have not always." Men so minded
   never understand the times, so as to know what Israel ought to do, or
   to approve the conduct of those who do know.

   A second admirable feature in Mary's character was the freedom of her
   spirit. She was not tied down to methods and rules of well-doing. The
   disciples, judging from their language, seem to have been great
   methodists, servile in their adherence to certain stereotyped modes of
   action. "This ointment," said they, "might have been sold for much, and
   given to the poor." They understand that charity to the poor is a very
   important duty: they know that their Master often referred to it; and
   they make it every thing. "Charity," in the sense of almsgiving, [419]
   is their hobby. When Judas went out to betray his Lord, they fancied
   that he was gone to distribute what remained of the supper among some
   poor persons of his acquaintance. Their very ideas of well-doing appear
   to be method-ridden. Good works with them do not seem to be
   co-extensive with noble deeds of all sorts. The phrase is technical,
   and limited in its application to a confined circle of actions of an
   expressly and obviously religious and benevolent nature.

   Not so with Mary. She knows of more ways of doing good than one. She
   can invent ways of her own. She is original, creative, not slavishly
   imitative. And she is as fearless as she is original. She cannot only
   imagine forms of well-doing out of the beaten track, but she has the
   courage to realize her conceptions. She is not afraid of the public.
   She does not ask beforehand, What will the twelve think of this? With a
   free mind she forms her plan, and with prompt, free hand she forthwith
   executes it.

   For this freedom Mary was indebted to her large heart. Love made her
   original in thought and conduct. People without heart cannot be
   original as she was. They may addict themselves to good works from one
   motive or another; but they go about them in a very slavish, mechanical
   way. They have to be told by some individual in whom they confide, or
   more commonly, by custom or fashion, what to do; and hence they never
   do any good which is not in vogue. But Mary needed no counselor: she
   took counsel of her own heart. Love told her infallibly what was the
   duty of the hour; that her business for the present was not to give
   alms, but to anoint the person of the great High Priest.

   We may learn from the example of Mary that love is, not less than
   necessity, the mother of invention. A great heart has fully as much to
   do with spiritual originality as a clever head. What is needed to fill
   the church with original preachers, original givers, original actors in
   all departments of Christian work, is not more brains, or more
   training, or more opportunities, but above all, more heart. When there
   is little love in the Christian community, it resembles a river in dry
   weather, which not only keeps within its banks, but does not even
   occupy the whole of its channel, leaving large beds of gravel or sand
   Iying high and dry on both sides of the current. But when the love of
   God is shed abroad in the hearts of her members, the church becomes
   like the same river in time of rain. The stream begins to rise, all the
   gravel beds gradually disappear, and at length the swollen flood not
   only fills its channel, but overflows its banks, and spreads over the
   meadows. New methods of well-doing are then attempted, and new measures
   of well-doing reached; new songs are indited and sung; new forms of
   expression for old truths are invented, not for the sake of novelty,
   but in the creative might of a new spiritual life.

   It was love that made Mary free from fear, as well as from the bondage
   of mechanical custom. "Love," saith one who knew love's power well,
   "casteth out fear." Love can make even shrinking, sensitive women bold
   -- bolder even than men. It can teach us to disregard that thing called
   public opinion, before which all mankind cowers. It was love that made
   Peter and John so bold when they stood before the Sanhedrim. They had
   been with Jesus long enough to love Him more than their own life, and
   therefore they quailed not before the face of the mighty. It was love
   that made Jesus Himself so indifferent to censure, and so disregardful
   of conventional restraints in the prosecution of His work. His heart
   was so devoted to His philanthropic mission, that He set at defiance
   the world's disapprobation; nay, probably did not so much as think of
   it, except when it obtruded itself upon His notice. And what love did
   for Mary, and for Jesus, and for the apostles in after days, it does
   for all. Wherever it exists in liberal measure, it banishes timidity
   and shyness, and the imbecility which accompanies these, and brings
   along with it power of character and soundness of mind. And to crown
   the encomium, we may add, that while it makes us bold, love does not
   make us impudent. Some men are bold because they are too selfish to
   care for other people's feelings. Those who are bold through love may
   dare to do things which will be found fault with; but they are always
   anxious, as far as possible, to please their neighbors, and to avoid
   giving of fence.

   One remark more let us make under this head. The liberty which springs
   from love can never be dangerous. In these days many people are greatly
   alarmed at the progress of broad school theology. And of the breadth
   that consists in sceptical indifference to catholic Christian truth we
   do well to be jealous. But, on the other hand, of the breadth and
   freedom due to consuming love for Christ, and all the grand interests
   of His kingdom, we cannot have too much. The spirit of charity may
   indeed treat as comparatively light matters, things which men of
   austere mind deem of almost vital importance, and may be disposed to do
   things which men more enamored of order and use and wont than of
   freedom may consider licentious innovations. But the harm done will be
   imaginary rather than real; and even if it were otherwise, the
   impulsive Marys are never so numerous in the church that they may not
   safely be tolerated. There are always a sufficient number of prosaic,
   order-loving disciples to keep their quixotic brethren in due check.

   Finally, the nobility of Mary's spirit was not less remarkable than its
   freedom. There was no taint of vulgar utilitarianism about her
   character. She thought habitually, not of the immediately, obviously,
   and materially useful, but of the honorable, the lovely, the morally
   beautiful. Hard, practical men might have pronounced her a romantic,
   sentimental, dreamy mystic; but a more just, appreciative estimate
   would represent her as a woman whose virtues were heroic and chivalrous
   rather than commercial. Jesus signalized the salient point in Mary's
   character by the epithet which He employed to describe her action. He
   did not call it a useful work, but a good, or, better still, a noble
   work.

   And yet, while Mary's deed was characteristically noble, it was not the
   less useful. All good deeds are useful in some way and at some time or
   other. All noble and beautiful things -- thoughts, words, deeds --
   contribute ultimately to the benefit of the world. Only the uses of
   such deeds as Mary's -- of the best and noblest needs -- are not always
   apparent or appreciable. If we were to make immediate, obvious, and
   vulgar uses the test of what is right, we should exclude not only the
   anointing in Bethany, but all fine poems and works of art, all
   sacrifices of material advantage to truth and duty; every thing, in
   fact, that has not tended directly to increase outward wealth and
   comfort, but has merely helped to redeem the world from vulgarity,
   given us glimpses of the far-off land of beauty and goodness,
   concerning which we now and then but faintly dream, brought us into
   contact with the divine and the eternal, made the earth classic ground,
   a field where heroes have fought, and where their bones are buried, and
   where the moss-grown stone stands to commemorate their valor.

   In this nobility of spirit Mary was pre-eminently the Christian. For
   the genius of Christianity is certainly not utilitarian. Its counsel
   is: "Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are venerable,
   whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
   things are lovely, think of these things." All these things are
   emphatically useful; but it is not of their utility, but of themselves,
   we are asked to think, and that for a very good reason. Precisely in
   order to be useful, we must aim at something higher than usefulness;
   just as, in order to be happy, we must aim at something higher than
   happiness. We must make right revealed to us by an enlightened
   conscience and a loving pure heart our rule of duty, and then we may be
   sure that uses of all kinds will be served by our conduct, whether we
   foresee them or not; whereas, if we make calculations of utility our
   guide in action, we shall leave undone the things which are noblest and
   best, because as a rule the uses of such things are least obvious, and
   longest in making their appearance. Supremely useful to the world is
   the heroic devotion of the martyr; but it takes centuries to develop
   the benefits of martyrdom; and if all men had followed the maxims of
   utilitarian philosophy, and made utility their motive to action, there
   would never have been any martyrs at all. Utilitarianism tends to
   trimming and time-serving; it is the death of heroism and
   self-sacrifice; it walks by sight, and not by faith; it looks only to
   the present, and forgets the future; it seats prudence on the throne of
   conscience; it produces not great characters, but at best petty
   busybodies. These things being considered, it need not surprise us to
   find that the term "usefulness," of such frequent recurrence in the
   religious vocabulary of the present day, has no place in the New
   Testament. [420]

   Four further observations may fitly close these meditations on the
   memorable transactions in Bethany.

   I. In all the attributes of character hitherto enumerated, Mary was a
   model of genuinely evangelic piety. The evangelic spirit is a Spilit of
   noble love and fearless liberty. It is a counterfeit evangelicism that
   is a slave to the past, to tradition, to fixed customs and methods in
   religion. The true name for this temper and tendency is legalism.

   2. From Christ's defense of Mary we may learn that being found fault
   with is not infallible evidence of being wrong. A much-blamed man is
   commonly considered to have done something amiss, as the only possible
   reason for his being censured. But, in truth, he may only have done
   something unusual; for all unusual things are found fault with -- the
   unusually good as well as, nay, more than, the unusually bad. Hence it
   comes that Paul makes the apparently superfluous remark, that there is
   no law against love and its kindred graces. In point of fact, these
   virtues are treated as if illegal and criminal whenever they exceed the
   usual stinted niggard measure in which such precious metals are found
   in the world. Was not He who perfectly embodied all the heavenly graces
   flung out of existence by the world as a person not to be tolerated?
   Happily the world ultimately comes round to a juster opinion, though
   often too late to be of service to those who have suffered wrong. The
   barbarians of the island of Malta, who, when they saw the viper
   fastened on Paul's hand, thought he must needs be a murderer, changed
   their minds when he shook off the reptile unharmed, and exclaimed, "He
   is a god." Hence we should learn this maxim of prudence, not to be too
   hasty in criticizing if we want to have credit for insight and
   consistency. But we should discipline ourselves to slowness in judging
   from far higher considerations. We ought to cherish a reverence for the
   character and for the personality of all intelligent responsible
   beings, and to be under a constant fear of making mistakes, and calling
   good evil, and evil good. In the words of an ancient philosopher, "We
   ought always to be very careful when about to blame or praise a man,
   lest we speak not rightly. For this purpose it is necessary to learn to
   discriminate between good and bad men. For God is displeased when one
   blames a person like Himself, or praises one unlike Himself. Do not
   imagine that stones and sticks, and birds and serpents, are holy, and
   that men are not. For of all things the holiest is a good man, and the
   most detestable a bad." [421]

   3. If we cannot be Christians like Mary, let us at all events not be
   disciples like Judas. Some may think it would not be desirable that all
   should be like the woman of Bethany: plausibly alleging that,
   considering the infirmity of human nature, it is necessary that the
   romantic, impulsive, mystic school of Christians should be kept in
   check by another school of more prosaic, conservative, and so to say,
   plebeian character; while perhaps admitting that a few Christians like
   Mary in the church help to preserve religion from degenerating into
   coarseness, vulgarity, and formalism. Be this as it may, the church has
   certainly no need for Judases. Judas and Mary! these two represent the
   two extremes of human character. The one exemplifies Plato's panton
   miarotaton (hatefullest of all things), the other his panton hierotaton
   (holiest of all things). Characters so diverse compel us to believe in
   a heaven and a hell. Each one goeth to his and her own place: Mary to
   the "land of the leal;." Judas to the land of the false, who sell their
   conscience and their God for gold.

   4. It is worthy of notice how naturally and appropriately Jesus, in His
   magnanimous defense of Mary's generous, large-hearted deed, rises to
   the full height of prophetic prescience, and anticipates for His gospel
   a world-wide diffusion: "Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in
   the whole world." Such a gospel could be nothing less than world-wide
   in sympathy, and no one who understood it and its Author could fail to
   have a burning desire to go into all the world and preach it unto every
   creature. This universalistic touch in Christ's utterance at this time,
   far from taking us by surprise, rather seems a matter of course. Even
   critics of the naturalistic school allow its genuineness. "This word in
   Bethany," says one of the ablest writers on the Gospel history
   belonging to this school, "is the solitary quite reliable word of the
   last period of Christ's life concerning the world-wide career which
   Jesus saw opening up for Himself and His cause." [422] If therefore the
   twelve remained narrow Judaists to the end, it was not due to the
   absence of the universalistic element in their Master's teaching, but
   simply to this, that they remained permanently as incapable of
   appreciating Mary's act, and the gospel whereof it was an emblem, as
   they showed themselves at this time. That they did so continue,
   however, we do not believe; and the best evidence of this is that the
   story of Mary of Bethany has attained a place in the evangelic records.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [410] On the apparent discrepancy between the synoptists and John as to
   time, and on all other points belonging to harmony, see the
   commentaries, especially Alford and Stier.

   [411] It is natural to connect the annointing with the raising of
   Lazarus, and to find in gratitude for the restoration of a brother to
   life the motive to that deed of love. It has been suggested that the
   ointment may originally have been provided for the burial rites of
   Lazarus.

   [412] See Neh. i. and ii. Nehemiah, like Mary, may be spoken of
   wherever the gospel is preached, to illustrate the heart of the
   Redeemer and interprest His thoughts.

   [413] There is a tendency among theologians of an ultra-scholastic
   habit of mind to treat all that is said of love in connection with the
   atonement as sentimental, or at most, as available only for popular
   purposes, and to represent the judicial aspect of the atonement as
   alone of scientific validity. Thus a recent writer on the History of
   Doctrines (Shedd) says: "All true scientific development of the
   doctrine of the atonement, it is very evident, must take its departure
   from the idea of divine justice. This conception is the primary one in
   the biblical representation of this doctrine." This author is greatly
   in love with "soteriologies" of scientific pretensions. He idolizes
   Anselm as the author of the "first metaphisique of the Christian
   doctrine of atonement," and as the first to challenge for the doctrine
   of vicarious satisfaction "both a rational necessity and a scientific
   rationaltiy." Anselm did certainly carry the passion for Ã  priori
   reasoning on the subject of redemption to its extreme limit. He aimed
   to demonstrate not only a hypothetical necessity for an atonement in
   order to salvation, but an absolute necessity. A certain number of
   sinners, he maintained, must be saved to fill up the numbers of the
   fallen angels, as "it is indubitable that rational nature which is or
   is to be happy in the contemplation of God is foreknown by God in a
   certain rational and perfect number which can neither be more nor less"
   (Cur Deus Homo, i. c. 16). How happy is one to get away from such
   science so called to the supper-room in Bethany! Let the august
   attribute of justice get its due place in the theology of atonement,
   but let not "love" be relegated from theology to popular sermons.
   Christ's death satisfied both divine justice and divine love, and the
   glory of the gospel is that the same event satisfied both.

   [414] Vide p. 25.

   [415] On the apparent waste in the economy of redemption, there are
   some good remarks in the writings of Andrew Fuller, and especially in
   Three Conversations on Particular Redemption. He says: "It accords with
   the general conduct of God to impart His favors with a kind of
   profusion which, to the mind of man that sees only one or two ends to
   be answered by them, may have the appearance of waste."

   [416] Ps. cxxxiii.

   [417] 2 Sam. vi.

   [418] The Scotch proverb to the same effect is, "Nae owers are guid."

   [419] We cannot regard as an improvement the exclusion of the word
   charity from the Revised Version. The motive is obvious enough, the
   fact that it is often employed in the sense of alms-giving. But it has
   a well-understood sense besides that, viz. "catholic love;" and it is
   altogether too precious a word in our religious vocabulary to be thrown
   away. The effect of the omission on the style of the R. V. is sometimes
   very unhappy. Thus in 2 Pet. i. 7, for "to brotherly kindness charity,"
   in the A. V., we have in R. V. "in your love of the brethren love."
   What could be more helpless?

19. FIRSTFRUITS OF THE GENTILES

    John 12:20-23.

   This narrative presents interesting points of affinity with that
   contained in the fourth chapter of John's Gospel, -- the story of the
   woman by the well. In both Jesus comes into contact with persons
   outside the pale of the Jewish church; in both He takes occasion from
   such contact to speak in glowing language of an hour that is coming,
   yea, now is, which shall usher in a glorious new era for the kingdom of
   God; in both He expresses, in the most intense, emphatic terms, His
   devotion to His Father's will, His faith in the future spread of the
   gospel, and His lively hope of a personal reward in glory; [423] in
   both, to note yet one other point of resemblance, He employs, for the
   expression of His thought, agricultural metaphors: in one case, the
   earlier, borrowing His figure from the process of reaping; in the
   other, the later, from that of sowing.

   But, besides resemblances, marked differences are observable in these
   two passages from the life of the Lord Jesus. Of these the most
   outstanding is this, that while on the earlier occasion there was
   nothing but enthusiasm, joy, and hope in the Saviors breast, on the
   present occasion these feelings are blended with deep sadness. His soul
   is not only elated with the prospect of coming glory, but troubled as
   with the prospect of impending disaster. The reason is that His death
   is nigh: it is within three days of the time when He must be lifted up
   on the cross; and sentient nature shrinks from the bitter Cut of
   suffering.

   But while we observe the presence of a new emotion here, we also see
   that its presence produces no abatement in the old emotions manifested
   by Jesus in connection with His interview with the woman of Samaria. On
   the contrary, the near prospect of death only furnishes the Saviour
   with the means of giving enhanced intensity to the expression of His
   devotion and His faith and hope. Formerly He said that the doing of His
   Father's will was more to Him than meat; now He says in effect that it
   is more to Him than life. [424] At the beginning He had seen by the eye
   of faith a vast extent of fields, white already to the harvest, in the
   wide wilderness of Gentile lands; now He not only continues to see
   these fields in spite of His approaching passion, but He sees them as
   the effect thereof -- a whole world of golden grain growing out of one
   corn of wheat cast into the ground, and rendered fruitful of life by
   its own death. [425] At the well of Sychar He had spoken with lively
   hope of the wages in store for Himself, and all fellow-laborers in the
   kingdom of God, whether sowers or reapers; here death is swallowed up
   in victory, through the power of His hope. To suffer is to enter into
   glory; to be lifted up on the cross is to be exalted to heaven, and
   seated on the throne of a world-wide dominion. [426]

   The men who desired to see Jesus while He stood in one of the courts of
   the temple were, the evangelist informs us, Greeks. Whence they came,
   whether from east or from west, or from north or from south, we know
   not; but they were evidently bent on entering into the kingdom of God.
   They had got so far on the way to the kingdom already. The presumption,
   at least, is that they had left Paganism behind, and had embraced the
   faith of One living, true God, as taught by the Jews, and were come at
   this time up to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover as Jewish
   proselytes. [427] But they had not, it would seem, found rest to their
   souls: there was something more to be known about God which was still
   hid from them. This they hoped to learn from Jesus, with whose name and
   fame they had somehow become acquainted. Accordingly, an opportunity
   presenting itself to them of communicating with one of those who
   belonged to His company, they respectfully expressed to him their
   desire to meet his Master. "Sir," said they, "we would see Jesus." In
   themselves the words might be nothing more than the expression of a
   curious wish to get a passing glimpse of one who was understood to be a
   remarkable man. Such an interpretation of the request, however, is
   excluded by the deep emotion it awakened in the breast of Jesus. Idle
   curiosity would not have stirred His soul in such a fashion. Then the
   notion that these Greeks were merely curious strangers is entirely
   inconsistent with the connection in which the story is introduced. John
   brings in the present narrative immediately after quoting a reflection
   made by the Pharisees respecting the popularity accruing to Jesus from
   the resurrection of Lazarus. "Perceive ye," said they to each other,
   "how ye prevail nothing? Behold, the world has gone after Him." "Yes,
   indeed," rejoins the evangelist in effect, "and that to an extent of
   which ye do not dream. He whom ye hate is beginning to be inquired
   after, even by Gentiles from afar, as the following history will show."

   We do right, then, to regard the Greek strangers as earnest inquirers.
   They were true seekers after God. They were genuine spiritual
   descendants of their illustrious countrymen Socrates and Plato, whose
   utterances, written or unwritten, were one long prayer for light and
   truth, one deep unconscious sigh for a sight of Jesus. They wanted to
   see the Saviour, not with the eye of the body merely, but, above all,
   with the eye of the spirit.

   The part played by the two disciples named in the narrative, in
   connection with this memorable incident, claims a brief notice. Philip
   and Andrew had the honor to be the medium of communication between the
   representatives of the Gentile world and Him who had come to fulfill
   the desire and be the Saviour of all nations. The devout Greeks
   addressed themselves to the former of these two disciples, and he in
   turn took his brother-disciple into his counsels. How Philip came to be
   selected as the bearer of their request by these Gentile inquirers, we
   do not know. Reference has been made to the fact that the name Philip
   is Greek, as implying the probability that the disciple who bore it had
   Greek connections, and the possibility of a previous acquaintance
   between him and the persons who accosted him on this occasion. There
   may be something in these conjectures, but it is more important to
   remark that the Greeks were happy in their choice of an intercessor.
   Philip was himself an inquirer, and had an inquirer's sympathy with all
   who might be in a similar state of mind. The first time he is named in
   the Gospel history he is introduced expressing his faith in Jesus, as
   one who had carefully sought the truth, and who, having at length found
   what he sought, strove to make others partakers of the blessing.
   "Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found Him of
   whom Moses, in the law and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth,
   the son of Joseph." The exactness and fullness of this confession
   speaks to careful and conscientious search. And Philip has still the
   inquirer's temper. A day or two subsequent to this meeting with the
   Greeks, we find him making for himself the most important request:
   "Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us."

   But why, then, does this sympathetic disciple not convey the request of
   the Greeks direct to Jesus? Why take Andrew with him, as if afraid to
   go alone on such an errand? Just because the petitioners are Greeks and
   Gentiles. It is one thing to introduce a devout Jew like Nathanael to
   Jesus, quite another to introduce Gentiles, however devout. Philip is
   pleased that his Master should be inquired after in such a quarter, but
   he is not sure about the propriety of acting on his first impulse. He
   hesitates, and is in a flurry of excitement in presence of what he
   feels to be a new thing, a significant event, the beginning of a
   religious revolution. [428] His inclination is to play the part of an
   intercessor for the Greeks; but he distrusts his own judgment, and,
   before acting on it, lays the case before his brother-disciple and
   fellow-townsman Andrew, to see how it will strike him. The result of
   the consultation was, that the two disciples came and told their
   Master. They felt that they were perfectly safe in mentioning the
   matter to Him, and then leaving Him to do as He pleased.

   From the narrative of the evangelist we learn that the communication of
   the two disciples mightily stirred the soul of Jesus. Manifestations of
   spiritual susceptibility, by persons who were aliens from the
   commonwealth of Israel, did always greatly move His feelings. The
   open-mindedness of the people of Sychar, the simple faith of the Roman
   centurion, the quick-witted faith of the Syro-Phoenician woman, the
   gratitude of the Samaritan leper, touched Him profoundly. Such
   exhibitions of spiritual life in unexpected quarters came upon His
   spirit like breezes on an Ãªolian harp, drawing forth from it sweetest
   tones of faith, hope, joy, charity; and, alas! also sometimes sad,
   plaintive tones of disappointment and sorrow, like the sighing of the
   autumn wind among Scottish pines, when He thought of the unbelief and
   spiritual deadness of the chosen people for whom He had done so much.
   [429] Never was His heart more deeply affected than on the present
   occasion. No marvel! What sight more moving than that of a human being
   seeking after God, the fountain of light and of life! Then the
   spontaneity of these Greek inquirers is beautiful. It is something to
   be thankful for in this unspiritual, unbelieving world, when one and
   another, here and there, responds to God's call, and receives a divine
   word which has been spoken to him. But here we have the rare spectacle
   of men coming uncalled: not sought after by Christ, and accepting Him
   offering Himself to them as a Saviour and Lord, but seeking Him, and
   begging it as a great favor to be admitted to His presence, that they
   may offer Him their sincere homage, and hear Him speak words of eternal
   life. They come, too, from a most unusual quarter; and, what is still
   more worthy to be noticed, at a most critical time. Jesus is just about
   to be conclusively rejected by His own people; just on the point of
   being crucified by them. Some have shut their eyes, and stopped their
   ears, and hardened their hearts in the most determined manner against
   Him and His teaching; others, not insensible to His merits, have meanly
   and heartlessly concealed their convictions, fearing the consequences
   of an open profession. The saying of the Prophet Esaias has been
   fulfilled in His bitter experience, "Who heath believed our report? and
   to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?" Pharisaism,
   Sadduceeism, ignorance, indifference, fickleness, cowardice, have
   confronted Him on every side. How refreshing, amidst abounding
   contradiction, stupidity, and dull insusceptibility, this intimation
   brought to Him at the eleventh hour: "Here are certain Greeks who are
   interested in you, and want to see you!" The words fall on His ear like
   a strain of sweet music; the news is reviving to His burdened spirit
   like the sight of a spring to a weary traveler in a sandy desert; and
   in the fullness of His joy He exclaims: "The hour is come that the Son
   of man should be glorified." Rejected by His own people, He is consoled
   by the inspiring assurance that He shall be believed on in the world,
   and accepted by the outlying nations as all their salvation and all
   their desire.

   The thoughts of Jesus at this time were as deep as His emotions were
   intense. Specially remarkable is the first thought to which He gave
   utterance in these words: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a
   corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it
   die, it bringeth forth much fruit." He speaks here with the solemnity
   of one conscious that he is announcing a truth new and strange to his
   hearers. His object is to make it credible and comprehensible to His
   disciples, that death and increase may go together. He points out to
   them that the fact is so in the case of grain; and He would have them
   understand that the law of increase, not only in spite but in virtue of
   death, will hold true equally in His own case. "A grain of wheat, by
   dying, becometh fruitful; so I must die in order to become, on a large
   scale, an object of faith and source of life. During my lifetime I have
   had little success. Few have believed, many have disbelieved; and they
   are about to crown their unbelief by putting me to death. But my death,
   so far from being, as they fancy, my defeat and destruction, will be
   but the beginning of my glorification. After I have been crucified, I
   shall begin to be believed in extensively as the Lord and Saviour of
   men."

   Having by the analogy of the corn of wheat set forth death as the
   condition of fruitfulness, Jesus, in a word subsequently spoken,
   proclaimed His approaching crucifixion as the secret of His future
   power. "I," said He, "if I be lifted up from the earth, will I all men
   unto me." He used the expression "lifted up" in a double sense, --
   partly, as the evangelist informs us, in allusion to the manner of His
   death, partly with reference to His ascension into heaven; and He meant
   to say, that after He had been taken up into glory, He would, through
   His cross, attract the eyes and hearts of men towards Himself. And,
   strange as such a statement might appear before the event, the fact
   corresponded to the Saviors expectation. The cross -- symbol of shame!
   -- did become a source of glory; the sign of weakness became an
   instrument of moral power. Christ crucified, though to unbelieving Jews
   a stumbling-block, and to philosophic Greeks foolishness, became to
   many believers the power of God and the wisdom of God. By His voluntary
   humiliation and meek endurance of suffering the Son of God drew men to
   Him in sincerest faith, and devoted reverential love.

   The largeness of Christ's desires and expectations is very noteworthy.
   He speaks of "much fruit," and of drawing "all men" unto Him. Of course
   we are not to look here for an exact definition of the extent of
   redemption. Jesus speaks as a man giving utterance, in the fullness of
   his heart, to his high, holy hope; and we may learn from His ardent
   words, if not the theological extent of atonement, at least the
   extensiveness of the Atoner's good wishes. He would have all men
   believe in Him and be saved. He complained with deep melancholy of the
   fewness of believers among the Jews; He turned with unspeakable longing
   to the Gentiles, in hope of a better reception from them. The greater
   the number of believers at any time and in any place, the better He is
   pleased; and He certainly does not contemplate with indifference the
   vast amount of unbelief which still prevails in all quarters of the
   world. His heart is set on the complete expulsion of the prince of this
   world from his usurped dominion, that He Himself may reign over all the
   kingdoms of the earth.

   The narrative contains a word of application addressed by Jesus to His
   disciples in connection with the law of increase by death, saying in
   effect that it applied to them as well as to Himself. [430] This
   appears at first surprising, insomuch that we are tempted to think that
   the sayings alluded to are brought in here by the evangelist out of
   their true historical connection. But on reconsideration we come to
   think otherwise. We observe that in all cases, wherever it is possible,
   Christ in His teaching takes His disciples into partnership with
   Himself. He does not insist on those aspects of truth which are
   peculiar to Himself, but rather on those which are common to Him with
   His followers. If there be any point of contact at all, any sense in
   which what He states of Himself is true of those who believe in Him, He
   seizes on that, and makes it a prominent topic of discourse. So He did
   on the occasion of the meeting by the well; so when He first plainly
   announced to His disciples that He was to be put to death. And so also
   He does here. Here, too, He asserts a fellowship between Himself and
   His followers in respect to the necessity of death as a condition of
   fruitfulness. And the fellowship asserted is not a far-fetched conceit:
   it is a great practical reality. The principle laid down is this, that
   in proportion as a man is a partaker of Christ's suffering in His
   estate of humiliation shall he be a partaker of the glory, honor, and
   power which belong to His estate of exaltation. This principle holds
   true even in this life. The bearing of the cross, the undergoing of
   death, is the condition of fruit bearing both in the sense of personal
   sanctification and in the sense of effective service in the kingdom of
   God. In the long-run the measure of a man's power is the extent to
   which he is baptized into Christ's death. We must fill up that which is
   behind of the afflictions of Christ in our flesh for His body's sake,
   which is the church, if we would be the honored instruments of
   advancing that great work in the world for which He was willing, like a
   corn of wheat, to fall into the ground and die.

   Striking as this saying is, it is not to be reckoned among those which
   contain a distinct contribution to the doctrine of the cross. No new
   principle or view is contained therein, only old views restated, the
   views taught in the first and second lessons being combined -- death a
   condition of life [431] and of power. [432] Even the very original word
   concerning the corn of wheat shows us no new aspect of Christ's death,
   but only helps by a familiar analogy to understand how death can be a
   means of increase. The main use of the foregoing chapter is to show us
   the beginnings of that Christian universalism which Jesus anticipated
   in speaking of Mary's act of anointing, and to serve as a foil to the
   chapter that follows concerning the doom of Jerusalem.

20. O JERUSALEM, JERUSALEM! OR, DISCOURSE ON THE LAST THINGS

    Matt. 21-25; Mark 11-13; Luke 19:29-48; 20; 21.

   The few days intervening between the anointing and the Passover were
   spent by Jesus in daily visits to Jerusalem in company with His
   disciples, returning to Bethany in the evening. During that time He
   spoke much in public and in private, on themes congenial to His
   feelings and situation: the sin of the Jewish nation, and specially of
   its religious leaders; the doom of Jerusalem, and the end of the world.
   The record of His sayings during these last days fills five chapters of
   Matthew's Gospel -- a proof of the deep impressions which they made on
   the mind of the twelve.

   Prominent among these utterances, which together form the dying
   testimony of the "Prophet of Nazareth," stands the great philippic
   delivered by Him against the scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem. This
   terrible discourse had been preceded by various encounters between the
   speaker and His inverate foes, which were as the preliminary skirmishes
   that form the prelude to a great engagement. In these petty fights
   Jesus had been uniformly victorious, and had overwhelmed His opponents
   with confusion. They had asked Him concerning His authority for taking
   upon Him the office of a reformer, in clearing the temple precincts of
   traders; and he had silenced them by asking in reply their opinion of
   John's mission, and by speaking in their hearing the parables of the
   Two Sons, the Vinedressers, and the Rejected Stone, [433] wherein their
   hypocrisy, unrighteousness, and ultimate damnation were vividly
   depicted. They had tried to catch Him in a trap by an insnaring
   question concerning the tribute paid to the Roman government; and he
   had extricated Himself with ease, by simply asking for a penny, and
   pointing to the emperor's head on it, demanding of His assailants,
   "Whose is this image and superscription?" and on receiving the reply,
   "CÃ¦sar's," giving His judgment in these terms: "Render therefore unto
   CÃ¦sar the things which are CÃ¦sar's, and unto God the things that are
   God's." [434] Twice foiled, the Pharisees (with their friends the
   Herodians) gave place to their usual foes, but present allies, the
   Sadducees, who attempted to puzzle Jesus on the subject of the
   resurrection, only to be ignominiously discomfited; [435] whereupon the
   pharisaic brigade returned to the charge, and through the mouth of a
   lawyer not yet wholly perverted inquired, "Which is the great
   commandment in the law?" To this question Jesus gave a direct and
   serious reply, summing up the whole law in love to God and love to man,
   to the entire contentment of His interrogator. Then, impatient of
   further trifling, He blew a trumpet-peal, the signal of a grand
   offensive attack, by propounding the question, "What think ye of
   Christ, whose son is He?" and taking occasion from the reply to quote
   the opening verse of David's martial psalm, asking them to reconcile it
   with their answer. [436] In appearance fighting the Pharisees with
   their own weapons, and framing a mere theological puzzle, He was in
   reality reminding them who He was, and intimating to them the predicted
   doom of those who set themselves against the Lord's anointed.

   Thereupon David's Son and David's Lord proceeded to fulfil the
   prophetic figure, and to make a footstool of the men who sat in Moses'
   seat, by delivering that discourse in which, to change the figure, the
   Pharisee is placed in a moral pillory, a mockery and a byword to all
   after ages; and a sentence is pronounced on the pharisaic character
   inexorably severe, yet justified by fact, and approved by the
   conscience of all true Christians. [437] This anti-pharisaic speech may
   be regarded as the final, decisive, comprehensive, dying testimony of
   Jesus against the most deadly and damning form of evil prevailing in
   His age, or that can prevail in any age -- religious hypocrisy; and as
   such it forms a necessary part of the Righteous One's witness-bearing
   in behalf of the truth, to which His disciples are expected to say Amen
   with no faltering voice. For the spirit of moral resentment is as
   essential in Christian ethics as the spirit of mercy; nor can any one
   who regards the anti-pharisaic polemic of the Gospel history as a
   scandal to be ashamed of, or a blemish to be apologized for, or at
   least as a thing which, however necessary at the time, propriety now
   requires us to treat with neglect, -- a practice too common in the
   religious world, -- be cleared of the suspicion of having more sympathy
   at heart with the men by whom the Lord was crucified than with the Lord
   Himself. Blessed is he who is not ashamed of Christ's sternest words;
   who, far from stumbling at those bold prophetic utterances, has rather
   found in them an aid to faith at the crisis of his religious history,
   as evincing an identity between the moral sentiments of the Founder of
   the faith and his own, and helping him to see that what he may have
   mistaken for, and what claimed to be, Christianity, was not that at
   all, but only a modern reproduction of a religious system which the
   Lord Jesus Christ could not endure, or be on civil terms with. Yea, and
   blessed is the church which sympathizes with, and practically gives
   effect to, Christ's warning words in the opening of this discourse
   against clerical ambition, the source of the spiritual tyrannies and
   hypocrisies denounced. Every church needs to be on its guard against
   this evil spirit. The government of the Jewish church, theoretically
   theocratic, degenerated at last into Rabbinism; and it is quite
   possible for a church which has for its motto, "One is your Master,
   even Christ," to fall into a state of abject subjection to the power of
   ambitious ecclesiastics.

   Without for a moment admitting that there is any thing in these
   invectives against hypocrisy to be apologized for, we must nevertheless
   advert to the view taken of them by some recent critics of the
   sceptical school. These speeches, then, we are told, are the rash,
   unqualified utterances of a young man, whose spirit was unmellowed by
   years and experience of the world; whose temperament was poetic,
   therefore irritable, impatient, and unpractical; and whose temper was
   that of a Jew, morose, and prone to bitterness in controversy. At this
   time, we are further to understand, provoked by persevering opposition,
   He had lost self-possession, and had abandoned Himself to the violence
   of anger, His bad humor having reached such a pitch as to make Him
   guilty of actions seemingly absurd, such as that of cursing the
   fig-tree. He had, in fact, become reckless of consequences, or even
   seemed to court such as were disastrous; and, weary of conflict, sought
   by violent language to precipitate a crisis, and provoke His enemies to
   put Him to death. [438]

   These are blasphemies against the Son of man as unfounded as they are
   injurious. The last days of Jesus were certainly full of intense
   excitement, but to a candid mind no traces of passion are discernible
   in His conduct. All His recorded utterances during those days are in a
   high key, suited to one whose soul was animated by the most sublime
   feelings. Every sentence is eloquent, every word tells; but all
   throughout is natural, and appropriate to the situation. Even when the
   terrible attack on the religious leaders of Israel begins, we listen
   awestruck, but not shocked. We feel that the speaker has a right to use
   such language, that what He says is true, and that all is said with
   commanding authority and dignity, such as became the Messianic King.
   When the speaker has come to an end, we breathe freely, sensible that a
   delicate though necessary task has been performed with not less wisdom
   than fidelity. Deep and undisguised abhorrence is expressed in every
   sentence, such as it would be difficult for any ordinary man, yea, even
   for an extraordinary one, to cherish without some admixture of that
   wrath which worketh not the righteousness of God. But in the
   antipathies of a Divine Being the weakness of passion finds no place:
   His abhorrence may be deep, but it is also ever calm; and we challenge
   unbelievers to point out a single feature in this discourse
   inconsistent with the hypothesis that the speaker is divine. Nay,
   leaving out of view Christ's divinity, and criticizing His words with a
   freedom unfettered by reverence, we can see no traces in them of a man
   carried headlong by a tempest of anger. We find, after strictest
   search, no loose expressions, no passionate exaggerations, but rather a
   style remarkable for artistic precision and accuracy. The pictures of
   the ostentatious, place-hunting, title-loving rabbi; of the hypocrite,
   who makes long prayers and devours widows' houses; of the zealot, who
   puts himself to infinite trouble to make converts, only to make his
   converts worse rather than better men; of the Jesuitical scribe, who
   teaches that the gold of the temple is a more sacred, binding thing to
   swear by than the temple itself; of the Pharisee, whose conscience is
   strict or lax as suits his convenience; of the whited sepulchres, fair
   without, full within of dead men's bones; of the men whose piety
   manifests itself in murdering living prophets and garnishing the
   sepulchres of dead ones, -- are moral daguerreotypes which will stand
   the minutest inspection of criticism, drawn by no irritated, defeated
   man, feeling sorely and resenting keenly the malice of his adversaries,
   but by one who has gained so complete a victory, that He can make sport
   of His foes, and at all events runs no risk of losing self-control.

   The aim of the discourse, equally with its style, is a sufficient
   defense against the charge of bitter personality. The direct object of
   the speaker was not to expose the blind guides of Israel, but to save
   from delusion the people whom they were misguiding to their ruin. The
   audience consisted of the disciples and the multitude who heard Him
   gladly. It is most probable that many of the blind guides were present;
   and it would make no difference to Jesus whether they were or not, for
   He had not two ways of speaking concerning men -- one before their
   faces, another behind their backs. It is told of Demosthenes, the great
   Athenian orator, and the determined opponent of Philip of Macedon, that
   he completely broke down in that king's presence on the occasion of his
   first appearance before him as an ambassador from his native city. But
   a greater than Demosthenes is here, whose sincerity and courage are as
   marvelous as His wisdom and eloquence, and who can say all He thinks of
   the religious heads of the people in their own hearing. Still, in the
   present instance, the parties formally addressed were not the heads of
   the people, but the people themselves; and it is worthy of notice how
   carefully discriminating the speaker was in the counsel which He gave
   them. He told them that what He objected to was not so much the
   teaching of their guides, as their lives: they might follow all their
   precepts with comparative impunity, but it would be fatal to follow
   their example. How many reformers in similar circumstances would have
   joined doctrine and practice together in one indiscriminate
   denunciation! Such moderation is not the attribute of a man in a rage.

   But the best clew of all to the spirit of the speaker is the manner in
   which His discourse ends: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" Strange ending for
   one filled with angry passion! O Jesus, Jesus! how Thou rises above the
   petty thoughts and feelings of ordinary men! Who shall fathom the
   depths of Thy heart? What mighty waves of righteousness, truth, pity,
   and sorrow roll through Thy bosom!

   Having uttered that piercing cry of grief, Jesus left the temple,
   never, so far as we know, to return. His last words to the people of
   Jerusalem were: "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. For I
   say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say,
   Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord." On the way from the
   city to Bethany, by the Mount of Olives, the rejected Saviour again
   alluded to its coming doom. The light-hearted disciples had drawn His
   attention to the strength and beauty of the temple buildings, then in
   full view. In too sad and solemn a mood for admiring mere architecture,
   He replied in the spirit of a prophet: "See ye not all these things?
   Verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon
   another, that shall not be thrown down." [439]

   Arrived at Mount Olivet, the company sat down to take a leisurely view
   of the majestic pile of which they had been speaking. How different the
   thoughts and feelings suggested by the same object to the minds of the
   spectators! The twelve look with merely outward eye; their Master looks
   with the inward eye of prophecy. They see nothing before them but the
   goodly stones; He sees the profanation in the interior, greedy traders
   within the sacred precincts, religion so vitiated by ostentation, as to
   make a poor widow casting her two mites into the treasury, in pious
   simplicity, a rare and pleasing exception. The disciples think of the
   present only; Jesus looks forward to an approaching doom, fearful to
   contemplate, and doubtless backward too, over the long and checkered
   history through which the once venerable, now polluted, house of God
   had passed. The disciples are elated with pride as they gaze on this
   national structure, the glory of their country, and are happy as
   thoughtless men are wont to be; the heart of Jesus is heavy with the
   sadness of wisdom and prescience, and of love that would have saved,
   but can now do nothing but weep, and proclaim the awful words of doom.

   Yet, with all their thoughtlessness, the twelve could not quite forget
   those dark forebodings of their Master. The weird words haunted their
   minds, and made them curious to know more. Therefore they came to
   Jesus, or some of them -- Mark mentions Peter, James, John, and Andrew
   [440] -- and asked two questions: when Jerusalem should be destroyed;
   and what should be the signs of His coming, and of the end of the
   world. The two events referred to in the questions -- the end of
   Jerusalem, and the end of the world -- were assumed by the questioners
   to be contemporaneous. It was a natural and by no means a singular
   mistake. Local and partial judgments are wont to be thus mixed up with
   the universal one in men's imaginations; and hence almost every great
   calamity which inspires awe leads to anticipations of the last day.
   Thus Luther, when his mind was clouded by the dark shadow of present
   tribulation, would remark: "The world cannot stand long, perhaps a
   hundred years at the outside. At the last will be great alterations and
   commotions, and already there are great commotions among men. Never had
   the men of law so much occupation as now. There are vehement
   dissensions in our families, and discord in the church." [441] In
   apostolic times Christians expected the immediate coming of Christ with
   such confidence and ardor, that some even neglected their secular
   business, just as towards the close of the tenth century people allowed
   churches to fall into disrepair because the end of the world was deemed
   close at hand.

   In reality, the judgment of Jerusalem and that of the world at large
   were to be separated by a long interval. Therefore Jesus treated the
   two things as distinct in His prophetic discourse, and gave separate
   answers to the two questions which the disciples had combined into one,
   that respecting the end of the world being disposed of first. [442]

   The answer He gave to this question was general and negative. He did
   not fix a time, but said in effect: "The end will not be till such and
   such things have taken place," specifying six antecedents of the end in
   succession, the first being the appearance of false Christs. [443] Of
   these He assured His disciples there would be many, deceiving many; and
   most truly, for several quack Messiahs did appear even before the
   destruction of Jerusalem, availing themselves of, and imposing on, the
   general desire for deliverance, even as quack doctors do in reference
   to bodily ailments, and succeeding in deceiving many, as unhappily in
   such times is only too easy. But among the number of their dupes were
   found none of those who had been previously instructed by the true
   Christ to regard the appearance of pseudo-Christs merely as one of the
   signs of an evil time. The deceivers of others were for them a
   preservative against delusion.

   The second antecedent is, "wars and rumors of wars." Nation must rise
   against nation: there must be times of upheaving and dissolution;
   declines and falls of empires, and risings of new kingdoms on the ruins
   of the old. This second sign would be accompanied by a third, in the
   shape of commotions in the physical world, emblematic of those in the
   political. Famines, earthquakes, pestilences, etc., would occur in
   divers places. [444]

   Yet these things, however dreadful, would be but the beginning of
   sorrows; nor would the end come till those signs had repeated
   themselves again and again. No one could tell from the occurrence of
   such phenomena that the end would be now; he could only infer that it
   was not yet. [445]

   Next in order come persecutions, with all the moral and social
   phenomena of persecuting times. [446] Christians must undergo a
   discipline of hatred among the nations because of the Name they bear,
   and as the reputed authors of all the disasters which befall the people
   among whom they live. Times must come when, if the Tiber inundate Rome,
   if the Nile overflow not his fields, if drought, earthquake, famine, or
   plague visit the earth, the cry of the populace will forthwith be, "The
   Christians to the lions!"

   Along with persecutions, as a fifth antecedent of the end, would come a
   sifting of the church. [447] Many would break down or turn traitors;
   there would spring up manifold animosities, schisms, and heresies, each
   named from its own false prophet. The prevalence of these evils in the
   church would give rise to much spiritual declension. "Because iniquity
   shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold." [448]

   The last thing that must happen ere the end come is the evangelization
   of the world; [449] which being achieved, the end would at length
   arrive. From this sign we may guess that the world will last a long
   while yet; for, according to the law of historical probability, it will
   be long ere the gospel shall have been preached to all men for a
   witness. Ardent Christians or enthusiastic students of prophecy who
   think otherwise must remember that sending a few missionaries to a
   heathen country does not satisfy the prescribed condition. The gospel
   has not been preached to a nation for a witness, that is, so as to form
   a basis of moral judgment, till it has been preached to the whole
   people as in Christendom. This has never yet been done for all the
   nations, and at the present rate of progress it is not likely to be
   accomplished for centuries to come.

   Having rapidly sketched an outline of the events that must precede the
   end of the world, Jesus addressed Himself to the more special question
   which related to the destruction of Jerusalem. He could now speak on
   that subject with more freedom, after He had guarded against the notion
   that the destruction of the holy city was a sign of His own immediate
   final coming. "When, then," He began, -- the introductory formula
   signifying, to answer now your first question, -- "ye shall see the
   abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the
   holy place, then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains;."
   the abomination of desolation being the Roman army with its eagles --
   abominable to the Jew, desolating to the land. When the eagles
   appeared, all might flee for their life; resistance would be vain,
   obstinacy and bravery utterly unavailing. The calamity would be so
   sudden that there would be no time to save any thing. It would be as
   when a house is on fire; people would be glad to escape with their
   life. [450] It would be a fearful time of tribulation, unparalleled
   before or after. [451] Woe to poor nursing mothers in those horrible
   days, and to such as were with child! What barbarities and inhumanities
   awaited them! The calamities that were coming would spare nobody, not
   even Christians. They would find safety only in flight, and they would
   have cause to be thankful that they escaped at all. But their flight,
   though unavoidable, might be more or less grievous according to
   circumstances; and they should pray for what might appear small
   mercies, even for such alleviations as that they might not have to flee
   to the mountains in winter, when it is cold and comfortless, or on the
   Sabbath, the day of rest and peace. [452]

   After giving this brief but graphic sketch of the awful days
   approaching, intolerable by mortal men were they not shortened "for the
   elect's sake," Jesus repeated His warning word against deception, as if
   in fear that His disciples, distracted by such calamities, might think
   "surely now is the end." He told them that violence would be followed
   by apostasy and falsehood, as great a trial in one way as the
   destruction of Jerusalem in another. False teachers should arise, who
   would be so plausible as almost to deceive the very elect. The devil
   would appear as an angel of light; in the desert as a monk, in the
   shrine as an object of superstitious worship. But whatever men might
   pretend, the Christ would not be there; nor would His appearance take
   place then, nor at any fixed calculable time, but suddenly,
   unexpectedly, like the lightning flash in the heavens. When moral
   corruption had attained its full development, then would the judgment
   come. [453]

   In the following part of the discourse, the end of the world seems to
   be brought into immediate proximity to the destruction of the holy
   city. [454] If a long stretch of ages was to intervene, the perspective
   of the prophetic picture seems at fault. The far-distant mountains of
   the eternal world, visible beyond and above the near hills of time in
   the foreground, want the dim-blue haze, which helps the eye to realize
   how far off they are. This defect in Matthew's narrative, which we have
   been taking for our text, is supplied by Luke, who interprets the
   tribulation (thlipsis) so as to include the subsequent long-lasting
   dispersion of Israel among the nations. [455] The phrase he employs to
   denote this period is significant, as implying the idea of lengthened
   duration. It is "the times of the Gentiles" (kairoi ethnon). The
   expression means, the time when the Gentiles should have their
   opportunity of enjoying divine grace, corresponding to the time of
   gracious visitation enjoyed by the Jews referred to by Jesus in His
   lament over Jerusalem. [456] There is no reason to suppose Luke coined
   these phrases; they bear the stamp of genuineness upon them. But if we
   assume, as we are entitled to do, that not Luke the Pauline
   universalist, but Jesus Himself, spoke of a time of merciful visitation
   of the Gentiles, then it follows that in His eschatological discourse
   He gave clear intimation of a lengthened period during which His gospel
   was to be preached in the world; even as He did on other occasions, as
   in the parable of the wicked husbandman, in which He declared that the
   vineyard should be taken from its present occupants, and given to
   others who would bring forth fruit. [457] For it is incredible that
   Jesus should speak of a time of the Gentiles analogous to the time of
   merciful visitation enjoyed by the Jews, and imagine that the time of
   the Gentiles was to last only some thirty years. The Jewish kairos
   lasted thousands of years: it would be only mocking the poor Gentiles
   to dignify the period of a single generation with the name of a season
   of gracious visitation.

   The parable of the fig-tree, employed by Jesus to indicate the sure
   connection between the signs foregoing and the grand event that was to
   follow, seems at first to exclude the idea of a protracted duration,
   but on second thoughts we shall find it does not. The point of the
   parable lies in the comparison of the signs of the times to the first
   buds of the fig-tree. This comparison implies that the last judgment is
   not the thing which is at the doors. The last day is the harvest
   season, but from the first buds of early summer to the harvest there is
   a long interval. The parable further suggests the right way of
   understanding the statement: "This generation shall not pass till all
   these things be fulfilled." Christ did not mean that the generation
   then living was to witness the end, but that in that generation all the
   things which form the incipient stage in the development would appear.
   It was the age of beginnings, of shoots and blossoms, not of fruit and
   ingathering. In that generation fell the beginnings of Christianity and
   the new world it was to create, and also the end of the Jewish world,
   of which the symbol was a fig-tree covered with leaves, but without any
   blossom or fruit, like that Jesus Himself had cursed, by way of an
   acted prophecy of Israel's coming doom. The buds of most things in the
   church's history appeared in that age: of gospel preaching, of
   antiChristian tendencies, of persecutions, heresies, schisms, and
   apostasies. All these, however, had to grow to their legitimate issues
   before the end came. How long the development would take, no man could
   tell, not even the Son of Man. [458] It was a state secret of the
   Almighty, into which no one should wish to pry.

   This statement, that the time of the end is known alone to God,
   excludes the idea that it can be calculated, or that data are given in
   Scripture for that purpose. If such data be given, then the secret is
   virtually disclosed. We therefore regard the calculations of students
   of prophecy respecting the times and seasons as random guesses unworthy
   of serious attention. The death-day of the world needs to be hid for
   the purposes of providence as much as the dying-day of individuals. And
   we have no doubt that God has kept His secret; though some fancy they
   can cast the world's horoscope from prophetic numbers, as astrologers
   were wont to determine the course of individual lives from the
   positions of the stars.

   Though the prophetic discourse of Jesus revealed nothing as to times,
   it was not therefore valueless. It taught effectively two lessons, --
   one specially for the benefit of the twelve, and the other for all
   Christians and all ages. The lesson for the twelve was, that they might
   dismiss from their minds all fond hopes of a restoration of the kingdom
   to Israel. Not reconstruction, but dissolution and dispersion, was
   Israel's melancholy doom.

   The general lesson for all in this discourse is: "Watch, for ye know
   not what hour your Lord doth come." The call to watchfulness is based
   on our ignorance of the time of the end, and on the fact that, however
   long delayed the end may be, it will come suddenly at last, as a thief
   in the night. The importance of watching and waiting, Jesus illustrated
   by two parables, the Absent Goodman and the Wise and Foolish Virgins.
   [459] Both parables depict the diverse conduct of the professed
   servants of God during the period of delay. The effect on some, we are
   taught, is to make them negligent, they being eye-servants and fitful
   workers, who need oversight and the stimulus of extraordinary events.
   Others, again, are steady, equal, habitually faithful, working as well
   when the master is absent as when they are under his eye. The treatment
   of both on the master's return corresponds to their respective
   behavior, -- one class being rewarded, the other punished. Such is the
   substance of the parable of the Absent Goodman. Luke gives an important
   appendix, which depicts the conduct of persons in authority in the
   house of the absent Lord. [460] While the common servants are for the
   most part negligent, the upper servants play the tyrant over their
   fellows. This is exactly what church dignitaries did in after ages; and
   the fact that Jesus contemplated such a state of things, requiring from
   the nature of the case the lapse of centuries to bring it about, is
   another proof that in this discourse His prophetic eye swept over a
   vast tract of time. Another remark is suggested by the great reward
   promised to such as should not abuse their authority: "He will make him
   ruler over all that he hath." The greatness of the reward indicates an
   expectation that fidelity will be rare among the stewards of the house.
   Indeed, the Head of the church seems to have apprehended the prevalence
   of a negligent spirit among all His servants, high and low; for He
   speaks of the lord of the household as so gratified with the conduct of
   the faithful, that he girds himself to serve them while they sit at
   meat. [461] Has not the apprehension been too well justified by events?

   The parable of the Ten Virgins, familiar to all, and full of
   instruction, teaches us this peculiar lesson, that watching does not
   imply sleepless anxiety and constant thought concerning the future, but
   quiet, steady attention to present duty. While the bridegroom tarried,
   all the virgins, wise and foolish alike, slumbered and slept, the wise
   differing from their sisters in having all things in readiness against
   a sudden call. This is a sober and reasonable representation of the
   duty of waiting by one who understands what is possible; for, in a
   certain sense, sleep of the mind in reference to eternity is as
   necessary as physical sleep is to the body. Constant thought about the
   great realities of the future would only result in weakness,
   distraction, and madness, or in disorder, idleness, and restlessness;
   as in Thessalonica, where the conduct of many who watched in the wrong
   sense made it needful that Paul should give them the wholesome counsel
   to be quiet, and work, and eat bread earned by the labor of their own
   hands. [462]

   The great prophetic discourse worthily ended with a solemn
   representation of the final judgment of the world, when all mankind
   shall be assembled to be judged either by the historical gospel
   preached to them for a witness, or by its great ethical principle, the
   law of charity written on their hearts; and when those who have loved
   Christ and served Him in person, or in His representatives, -- the
   poor, the destitute, the suffering, -- shall be welcomed to the realms
   of the blessed, and those who have acted contrariwise shall be sent
   away to keep company with the devil and his angels.

     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. THE WASHING

    John 13:1-11.

   Up to this point the fourth evangelist has said very little indeed of
   the special relations of Jesus and the twelve. Now, however, he
   abundantly makes up or any deficiency on this score. The third part of
   his Gospel, which begins here, is, with the exception of two chapters
   relating the history of the passion, entirely occupied with the tender,
   intimate intercourse of the Lord Jesus with "His own," from the evening
   before His death to the time when He departed out of the world, leaving
   them behind! The thirteenth and four following chapters relate scenes
   and discourses from the last hours spent by the Saviour with His
   disciples, previous to His betrayal into the hands of His enemies. He
   has uttered His final word to the outside world, and withdrawn Himself
   within the bosom of His own family; and we are privileged here to see
   Him among His spiritual children, and to hear His farewell Words to
   them in view of His decease. It becomes us to enter the supper chamber
   with deep reverence. "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the
   place whereon thou standest is holy ground."

   The first thing we see, on entering, is Jesus washing His disciples'
   feet. Marvellous spectacle! and the evangelist has taken care, in
   narrating the incident, to enhance its impressiveness by the manner in
   which he introduces it. He has put the beautiful picture in the best
   light for being seen to advantage. The preface to the story is indeed a
   little puzzling to expositors, the sentences being involved, and the
   sense somewhat obscure. Many thoughts and feelings crowd into the
   apostle's mind as he proceeds to relate the memorabilia of that
   eventful night; and, so to speak, they jostle one another in the
   struggle for utterance. Yet it is not very difficult to disentangle the
   meaning of these opening sentences. In the first, John adverts to the
   peculiar tenderness with which Jesus regarded His disciples on the eve
   of His crucifixion, and in prospect of His departure from the earth to
   heaven. "Before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His
   hour was come that He should depart out of this world " -- how at such
   an hour did He feel towards those who had been His companions
   throughout the years of His public ministry, and whom He was soon to
   leave behind Him? "He loved them unto the end." Not selfishly engrossed
   with His own sorrows, or with the prospect of His subsequent joys, He
   found room in His heart for His followers still; nay, His love burned
   out towards them with extraordinary ardor, and His whole care was by
   precept and example, by words of comfort, warning, and instruction, to
   prepare them for future duty and trial, as the narrative here
   commencing would abundantly demonstrate.

   The second verse of the preface alludes parenthetically to a fact which
   served as a foil to the constancy of Jesus: "The devil having already
   put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray Him."
   John would say: "Jesus loved His disciples to the end, though they did
   not all so love Him. One of them at this very moment entertained the
   diabolic purpose of betraying his Lord. Yet that Lord loved even him,
   condescending to wash even his feet; so endeavoring, if possible, to
   overcome his evil with good."

   The aim of the evangelist, in the last sentence of his preface, is to
   show by contrast what a wondrous condescension it was in the Saviour to
   wash the feet of any of the disciples. Jesus knowing these things, --
   these things being true of Him: that "the Father had given all things
   into His hands" -- sovereign power over all flesh; "that He was come
   from God" -- a divine being by nature, and entitled to divine honors;
   "and that He was about to return to God," to enter on the enjoyment of
   such honors, -- did as is here recorded. He, the August Being who had
   such intrinsic dignity, such a consciousness, such prospects -- even
   "He riseth from supper and lath aside His garments, and took a towel
   and girded Himself. After that He poureth water into a basin, and began
   to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith
   He was girded."

   The time when all this took place was, it would seem, about the
   commencement of the evening meal. The words of the evangelist rendered
   in the English version "supper being ended," may be translated supper
   being begun, or better, supper-time having arrived; [463] and from the
   sequel of the narrative, it is evident that in this sense they must be
   understood here. The supper was still going on when Jesus introduced
   the subject of the traitor, which He did not only after He had washed
   the feet of His disciples, but after He had resumed His seat at the
   table, and given an explanation of what He had just done. [464]

   That explanation will fall to be more particularly considered
   afterwards; but meantime it bears on its face that the occasion of the
   feet-washing was some misbehavior on the part of the disciples. Jesus
   had to condescend, we judge, because His disciples would not
   condescend. This impression is confirmed by a statement in Luke's
   Gospel, that on the same evening a strife arose among the twelve which
   of them should be accounted the greatest. Whence that new strife arose
   we know not, but it is possible that the old quarrel about place was
   revived by the words uttered by Jesus as they were about to sit down to
   meat: "With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before
   I suffer. For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof until it
   be fulfilled in the kingdom of God." [465] The allusion to the kingdom
   was quite sufficient to set their imaginations on fire and re-awaken
   old dreams about thrones, and from old dreams to old feuds and
   jealousies the transition was natural and easy; and so we can conceive
   how, even before the supper began, the talk of the brethren had waxed
   noisy and warm. Or the point in dispute may have been in what order
   they should sit at table, or who should be the servant for the
   occasion, and wash the feet of the company. Any one of these
   suppositions might account for the fact recorded by Luke; for it does
   not require much to make children quarrel.

   The expedient employed by Jesus to divert the minds of His disciples
   from unedifying themes of conversation, and to exorcise ambitious
   passions from their breasts, was a most effectual one. The very
   preliminaries of the feet-washing scene must have gone far to change
   the current of feeling. How the spectators must have stared and
   wondered as the Master of the feast rose from His seat, laid aside His
   upper garment, girt Himself with a towel, and poured out water into a
   basin, doing all with the utmost self-possession, composure, and
   deliberation!

   With which of the twelve Jesus made a beginning we are not informed;
   but we know, as we might have guessed without being told, who was the
   first to speak his mind about the singular transaction. When Peter's
   turn came, he had so far recovered from the amazement, under whose
   influence the first washed may have yielded passively to their Lord's
   will, as to be capable of reflecting on the indecency of such an
   inversion of the right relation between master and servants. Therefore,
   when Jesus came to him, that outspoken disciple asked, in astonishment,
   "Lord, washest Thou my feet?" His spirit rose in rebellion against the
   proposal, as one injurious to the dignity of his beloved Lord, and as
   an outrage upon his own sense of reverence. This impulse of instinctive
   aversion was by no means discreditable to Peter, and it was evidently
   not regarded with disapprobation by his Master. The reply of Jesus to
   his objection is markedly respectful in tone: "What I do," He said,
   "thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter," virtually
   admitting that the proceeding in question needed explanation, and that
   Peter's opposition was, in the first place, perfectly natural. "I
   acknowledge," He meant to say, "that my present action is an offence to
   the feelings of reverence which you rightly cherish towards me.
   Nevertheless, suffer it. I do this for reasons which you do not
   comprehend now, but which you shall understand ere long."

   Had Peter been satisfied with this apologetic reply, his conduct would
   have been entirely free from blame. But He was not content, but
   persisted in opposition after Jesus had distinctly intimated His will,
   and vehemently and stubbornly exclaimed: "Thou shalt never wash my
   feet!" The tune here changes utterly. Peter's first word was the
   expression of sincere reverence; his second is simply the language of
   unmitigated irreverence and downright disobedience. He rudely
   contradicts his Master, and at the same time, we may add, flatly
   contradicts himself. His whole behavior on this occasion presents an
   odd mixture of moral opposites: self-abasement and self-will, humility
   and pride, respect and disrespect for Jesus, to whom he speaks now as
   one whose shoe-latchet he is not worthy to unloose, and anon as one to
   whom he might dictate orders. What a strange man! But, indeed, how
   strange are we all!

   Peter having so changed his tone, Jesus found it needful to alter His
   tone too, from the apologetic mildness of the first reply to that of
   magisterial sternness. "If I wash thee not," He said gravely, "thou
   hast no part with me;." meaning, "Thou hast taken up a most serious
   position, Simon Peter, the question at issue being simply, Are you, or
   are you not, to be admitted into my kingdom -- to be a true disciple,
   and to have a true disciple's reward?"

   On a surface view, it is difficult to see how this could be the state
   of the question. One is tempted to think that Jesus was indulging in
   exaggeration, for the purpose of intimidating a refractory disciple
   into compliance with His will. If we reject this method of
   interpretation as incompatible with the character of the speaker and
   the seriousness of the occasion, we are thrown back on the inquiry,
   What does washing in this statement mean? Evidently it signifies more
   than meets the ear, more than the mere literal washing of the feet, and
   is to be regarded as a symbol of the washing of the soul from sin, or
   still more comprehensively, and in our opinion more correctly, as
   representing all in Christ's teaching and work which would be
   compromised by the consistent carrying out of the principle on which
   Peter's opposition to the washing of his feet by Jesus was based. On
   either supposition the statement of Jesus was true: in the former case
   obviously; in the latter not so obviously, but not less really, as we
   proceed to show.

   Observe, then, what was involved in the attitude assumed by Peter. He
   virtually took his stand on these two positions: that he would admit of
   nothing which seemed inconsistent with the personal dignity of his
   Lord, and that he would adopt as his rule of conduct his own judgment
   in preference to Christ's will; the one position being involved in the
   question, Dost Thou wash my feet? the other in the resolution, Thou
   shalt never wash my feet. In other words, the ground taken up by this
   disciple compromised the whole sum and substance of Christianity, the
   former principle sweeping away Christ's whole state and experience of
   humiliation, and the latter not less certainly sapping the foundation
   of Christ's lordship.

   That this is no exaggeration on our part, a moment's reflection will
   show. Look first at the objection to the feet washing on the score of
   reverence. If Jesus might not wash the feet of His disciples because it
   was beneath His dignity, then with equal reason objection might be
   taken to any act involving self-humiliation. One who said, Thou shalt
   not wash my feet, because the doing of it is unworthy of Thee, might as
   well say, Thou shalt not wash my soul, or do aught towards that end,
   because it involves humiliating experiences. Why, indeed, make a
   difficulty about a trifling matter of detail? Go to the heart of the
   business at once, and ask, "Shall the Eternal Son of God become flesh,
   and dwell among us? shall He who was in the form of God lay aside His
   robes of state, and gird Himself with the towel of humanity, to perform
   menial offices for His own creatures? shall the ever-blessed One become
   a curse by enduring crucifixion? shall the Holy One degrade Himself by
   coming into close companionship with the depraved sons of Adam? shall
   the Righteous One pour His life-blood into a basin, that there may be a
   fountain wherein the unrighteous may be cleansed from their guilt and
   iniquity?" In short, incarnation, atonement, and Christ's whole earthly
   experience of temptation, hardship, indignity, and sorrow, must go if
   Jesus may not wash a disciple's feet.

   Not less clearly is Christ's lordship at an end if a disciple may give
   Him orders, and say, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." If Peter meant
   any thing more by these words than a display of temper and caprice, he
   meant this: that he would not submit to the proposed operation, because
   his moral feelings and his judgment told him it was wrong. He made his
   own reason and conscience the supreme rule of conduct. Now, in the
   first place, by this position the principle of obedience was
   compromised, which requires that the will of the Lord, once known,
   whether we understand its reason or perceive its goodness or not, shall
   be supreme. Then there are other things much more important than the
   washing of the feet, to which objection might be taken on the score of
   reason or conscience with equal plausibility. For example, Christ tells
   us that those who would be His disciples, and obtain entrance into His
   kingdom, must be willing to part with earthly goods, and even with
   nearest and dearest friends. To many men this seems unreasonable; and
   on Peter's principle they should forthwith say, "I will never do any
   such thing." Or again, Christ tells us that we must be born again, and
   that we must eat His flesh and drink His blood. To me these doctrines
   may seem incomprehensible, and even absurd; and therefore, on Peter's
   principle, I may turn my back on the great Teacher, and say, "I will
   not have this speaker of dark, mystic sayings for my master." Once
   more, Christ tells us that we must give the kingdom of God the first
   place in our thoughts, and dismiss from our hearts carking care for
   to-morrow. To me this may appear in my present mood simply impossible;
   and therefore, on Peter's principle, I may set aside this moral
   requirement as utopian, however beautiful, without even seriously
   attempting to comply with it.

   Now that we know whither Peter's refusal tends, we can see that Jesus
   spake the simple truth when He said: "If I wash thee not, thou host no
   part with me." Look at that refusal as an objection to Christ humbling
   Himself. If Christ may not humble Himself, then, in the first place, He
   can have no part with us. The Holy Son of God is forbidden by a regard
   to His dignity to become in any thing like unto His brethren, or even
   to acknowledge them as His brethren. The grand paternal law, by which
   the Sanctifier is identified with them that are to be sanctified, is
   disannulled, and all its consequences made void. A great impassable
   gulf separates the Divine Being from His creatures. He may stand on the
   far-off shore, and wistfully contemplate their forlorn estate; but He
   cannot, He dare not -- His majesty forbids it -- come near them, and
   reach forth a helping hand.

   But if the Son of God may have no part with us, then, in the second
   place, we can have no part with Him. We cannot share His fellowship
   with the Father, if He come not forth to declare Him. We can receive no
   acts of brotherly kindness from Him. He cannot deliver us from the
   curse of the law, or from the fear of death; He cannot succor us when
   we are tempted; He cannot wash our feet; nay, what is a far more
   serious matter, He cannot wash our souls. If there is to be no fountain
   opened for sin in the human nature of Emmanuel sinners must remain
   impure. For a God afar off is not able, even if He were willing, to
   purify the human soul. A God whose majesty, like an iron fate, kept Him
   aloof from sinners, could not even effectively forgive them. Still less
   could He sanctify them. Love alone has sanctifying virtue, and what
   room is there for love in a Being who cannot humble Himself to be a
   servant?

   Look now at Peter's refusal as resistance to Christ's will. In this
   view also it justified the saying, "Thou hast no part with me." It
   excluded from salvation; for if Jesus is not to be Lord, He will not be
   Savior. [466] It excluded from fellowship; for Jesus will have no
   communion with self-will. His own attitude towards His Father was, "not
   my will, but Thine;." and He demands this attitude towards Himself in
   turn from all His disciples. He will be the Author of eternal
   salvation, only to them that obey Him. Not that He would have us be
   always servants, blindly obeying a Lord whose will we do not
   understand. His aim is to advance us ultimately to the status of
   friends, [467] doing His will intelligently and freely -- not as
   complying mechanically with an outward commandment, but as being a law
   to ourselves. But we can attain that high position only by beginning
   with a servant's obedience. We must do, and suffer to be done to us,
   what we know not now, in order that we may know hereafter the
   philosophy of our duty to our Lord, and of our Lord's dealings with us.
   And the perfection of obedience lies in doing that which reverence
   unenlightened finds peculiarly hard, viz. in letting the Lord change
   places with us, and if it seem good to Him, humble Himself to be our
   servant.

   It was a serious thing, therefore, to say, "Thou shalt never wash my
   feet." But Peter was not aware how serious it was. He knew not what he
   said, or what he did. He had hastily taken up a position whose ground
   and consequences he had not considered. And his heart was right, though
   his temper was wrong. Therefore the stern declaration of Jesus at once
   brought him to reason, or rather to unreason in an opposite direction.
   The idea of being cut off from his dear Master's sympathy or favor
   through his waywardness drove him in sheer fright to the opposite
   extreme of overdone compliance; and he said in effect, "If my interest
   in Thee depends on my feet being washed, then, Lord, wash my whole body
   -- hands, head, feet, and all." How characteristic! how like a child,
   in whose heart is much foolishness, but also much affection, and who
   can always be managed by the bands of love! There is as yet a sad want
   of balance in this disciple's character: he goes, swinging like a
   pendulum, from one extreme to another; and it will take some time ere
   he settle down into a harmonious equipoise of all parts of his being --
   intellect, will, heart, and conscience. But the root of the matter is
   in him: he is sound at the core; and after the due amount of mistakes,
   he will become a wise man by and by. He is clean, and needs not more
   than to have his feet washed. Jesus Himself admits it of him, and of
   all his brother-disciples -- save one, who is unclean all over.

   [463] Alford, in loco, gives as examples of a similar use of genomenos,
   Matt. xxvi. 6; John xxi. 4; Mark vi. 2. Hofmann (Schriftbeweis, iii.

    John xiii. 12-20.

   Peter's resistance overcome, the washing proceeded without further
   interruption. When the process had come to an end, Jesus, putting on
   again His upper garment, resumed His seat, and briefly explained to His
   disciples the purport of the action. "Know ye," He inquired, "what I
   have done unto you?" Then, answering His own question, He went on to
   say: "Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I,
   then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to
   wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye
   should do as I have done to you."

   It was another lesson in humility which Jesus had been giving "His
   own," -- a lesson very similar to the earlier ones recorded in the
   synoptical Gospels. John's Christ, we see here, teaches the same
   doctrine as the Christ of the three first evangelists. The twelve, as
   they are depicted in the fourth Gospel, are just such as we have found
   them in Matthew, Mark, and Luke -- grievously needing to be taught
   meekness and brotherly kindness; and Jesus teaches them these virtues
   in much the same way here as elsewhere -- by precept and example, by
   symbolic act, and added word of interpretation. Once He held up a
   little child, to shame them out of ambitious passions; here He rebukes
   their pride, by becoming the menial of the household. At another time
   He hushed their angry strife by adverting to His own self-humiliation,
   in coming from heaven to be a minister to men's needs in life and in
   death; here He accomplishes the same end, by expressing the spirit and
   aim of His whole earthly ministry in a representative, typical act of
   condescension.

   This lesson, like all the rest, Jesus gave with the authority of one
   who might lay down the law. In the very act of playing the servant's
   part, He was asserting His sovereignty. He reminds His disciples, when
   the service is over, of the titles they were wont to give Him, and in a
   marked, emphatic manner He accepts them as His due. He tells them
   distinctly that He is indeed their Teacher, whose doctrine it is their
   business to learn, and their Lord, whose will it is their duty to obey.
   His humility, therefore, is manifestly not an affectation of ignorance
   as to who and what He is. He knows full well who He is, whence He has
   come, whither He is going; His humility is that of a king, yea, of a
   Divine Being. The pattern of meekness is at the same time one who
   prescribes Himself to His followers as a pattern, and demands that they
   fix their attention on His behavior, and strive to copy it.

   In making this demand, Jesus is obviously very thoroughly in earnest.
   He is not less earnest in requiring the disciples to wash one another's
   feet, than He was in insisting that He Himself should wash the feet of
   one and all. As He said to Peter in express words, "If I wash thee not,
   thou hast no part with me;." so He says to them all in effect, though
   not in words,"If ye wash not each other, if ye refuse to serve one
   another in love, ye have again no part with me." This is a hard saying;
   for if it be difficult to believe in the humiliation of Christ, it is
   still more difficult to humble ourselves. Hence, notwithstanding the
   frequency and urgency with which the Saviour declares that we must have
   the spirit manifested in His humiliation for us dwelling in us, and
   giving birth in our life to conduct kindred to His own, even sincere
   disciples are constantly, though it may be half unconsciously,
   inventing excuses for treating the example of their Lord as utterly
   inimitable, and therefore in reality no example at all. Even the
   apparently unanswerable argument employed by Jesus to enforce imitation
   does not escape secret criticism. "Verily, verily," saith He, "a
   servant is not greater than his lord, neither he that is sent greater
   than he that sent him." "It may," say we, "be more incumbent on the
   servant to humble himself than on the master, but in some respects it
   is also more difficult. The master can afford to condescend: his action
   will not be misunderstood, but will be taken for what it is. But the
   servant cannot afford to be humble: he must assert himself, and assume
   airs, in order to make himself of any consequence."

   The great Master knew too well how slow men would ever be to learn the
   lesson He had just been teaching His disciples. Therefore He appended
   to His explanation of the feet-washing this reflection: "If ye know
   these things, happy are ye if ye do them," hinting at the rarity and
   difficulty of such high morality as He had been inculcating, and
   declaring the blessedness of the few who attained unto it. And surely
   the reflection is just! Is not the morality here enjoined indeed rare?
   Are not the virtues called into play by acts of condescension and
   charity most high and difficult? Who dreams of calling them easy? How
   utterly contrary they are to the native tendencies of the human heart!
   how alien from the spirit of society! Is it the way of men to be
   content with the humblest place, and to seek their felicity in serving
   others? Doth not the spirit that is in us lust unto envy, strive
   ambitiously for positions of influence, and deem it the greatest
   happiness to be served, and to be exempt from the drudgery of servile
   tasks? The world itself does not dispute the difficulty of Christ-like
   virtue; it rather exaggerates its difficulty, and pronounces it utopian
   and impracticable -- merely a beautiful, unattainable ideal.

   And as for the sincere disciple of Jesus, no proof is needed to
   convince him of the arduousness of the task appointed him by his Lord.
   He knows by bitter experience how far conduct lags behind knowledge,
   and how hard it is to translate admiration of unearthly goodness into
   imitation thereof. His mind is familiarly conversant with the doctrine
   and life of the Saviour; he has read and re-read the Gospel story,
   fondly lingering over its minutest details; his heart has burned as he
   followed the footsteps of the Blessed One walking about on this earth,
   ever intent on doing good: sweeter to his ear than the finest lyric
   poems are the stories of the woman by the well, the sinner in the house
   of Simon, and of Zaccheus the publican; those touching incidents of the
   little child upheld as a pattern of humility, and of the Master washing
   quarrelsome disciples' feet, and the exquisite parables of the Lost
   Sheep, the Prodigal, and the Good Samaritan. But when he has to close
   his New Testament, and go away into the rude, ungodly, matter-of-fact
   world, and be there a Christ-like man, and do the things which he knows
   so intimately, and counts himself blessed in knowing, alas, what a
   descent! It is like a fall from Eden into a state of mere sin and
   misery. And the longer he lives, and the more he gets mixed up with
   life's relations and engagements, the further he seems to himself to
   degenerate from the gospel pattern; till at length he is almost ashamed
   to think or speak of the beauties of holiness exhibited therein, and is
   tempted to adopt a lower and more worldly tone, out of a regard to
   sincerity, and in fear of becoming a mere sentimental hypocrite like
   Judas, who kissed his Master at the very moment he was betraying Him.

   In proportion to the difficulty and the rarity of the virtue prescribed
   is the felicity of those who are enabled to practice it. Theirs is a
   threefold blessedness. First, they have the joy connected with the
   achievement of an arduous task. Easy undertakings bring small pains,
   but they also bring small pleasures; rapturous delight is reserved for
   those who attempt and accomplish that which passes for impossible. And
   what raptures can be purer, holier, and more intense than those of the
   man who has at length succeeded in making the mind of the meek and
   lowly One his own; who, after long climbing, has reached the alpine
   summit of self-forgetful, self-humbling love! Those who practice the
   things here enjoined further win for themselves the approbation of
   their Lord. A master is pleased when a pupil understands his lesson,
   but a lord is pleased only when his servants do his bidding. Christ,
   being Lord as well as Master, demands that we shall not only know but
   do. And in proportion to the peremptoriness of the demand is the
   satisfaction with which the Lord of Christians regards all earnest
   efforts to comply with His will and to follow His example. And to all
   who make such efforts it is a great happiness to be assured of the
   approval of Him whom they serve. The thought, "I am guided in my
   present action by the spirit of Jesus, and He approves what I do,"
   sustains the mind in peace, even when one has not the happiness to win
   the approbation of his fellow-men; which is not an impertinent remark
   here, for it will often happen to us to please men least when we are
   pleasing the Lord most. You shall please many men by a prudent
   selfishness much more readily than by a generous uncalculating devotion
   to what is right. "Men will praise thee when thou doest well to
   thyself;." and they will wink at very considerable deviations from the
   line of pure Christian morality in the prosecution of self-interest,
   provided you be successful. Even religious people will often vex and
   grieve you by advices savoring much more of worldly wisdom than of
   Christian simplicity and godly sincerity. But if Christ approve, we may
   make shift to do without the sympathy and approbation of men. Their
   approbation is at most but a comfort; His is matter of life and death.

   The third element in the felicity of the man who is not merely a
   forgetful hearer, but a doer of the perfect law of Christ, is that he
   escapes the guilt of unimproved knowledge. It is a religious
   commonplace that to sin against light is more heinous than to sin in
   ignorance. "To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it
   is sin." And, of course, the clearer the light the greater the
   responsibility. Now, in no department of Christian truth is knowledge
   clearer than in that which belongs to the department of ethics. There
   are some doctrines which the church, as a whole, can hardly be said to
   know, they are so mysterious, or so disputed. But the ethical teaching
   of Jesus is simple and copious in all its leading features; it is
   universally understood, and as universally admired. Protestants and
   Papists, Trinitarians, Socinians, and Deists, are all at one here.
   Happy then are they, of all sects and denominations, who do the things
   which all know and agree in admiring; for a heavy woe lies on those who
   do them not. The woe is not indeed expressed, but it is implied in
   Christ's words. The common Lord of all believers virtually addresses
   all Christendom here, saying: "Ye behold the sunlight of a perfect
   example; ye have been made acquainted with a high and lovely ideal of
   life, such as pagan moralists never dreamed of. What are ye doing with
   your light? Are ye merely looking at it, and writing books about it,
   and boasting of it, and talking of it, meanwhile allowing men outside
   the pale of the church to surpass you in humane and philanthropic
   virtue? If this is all the use you are making of your knowledge, it
   will be more tolerable for pagans at the day of judgment than for you."

   Having made the reflection we have been considering, Jesus followed it
   up with a word of apology for the tone of suspicion with which it was
   uttered, and which was no doubt felt by the disciples. "I speak not,"
   He said, "of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture
   may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel
   against me." The remark may be thus paraphrased: "In hinting at the
   possibility of a knowledge of right, unaccompanied by corresponding
   action, I have not been indulging in gratuitous insinuation. I do not
   indeed think so badly of you all as to imagine you capable of
   deliberate and habitual neglect of known duty. But there is one among
   you who is capable of such conduct. I have chosen you twelve, and I
   know the character of every one of you; and, as I said a year ago,
   after asking a question which hurt your feelings, that one of you had a
   devil, [468] so now, after making a suspicious reflection, I say there
   is one among you whose character illustrates negatively its meaning;
   one who knows, but will not do; who puts sentiment in place of action,
   and admiration in place of imitation; one who, having eaten bread with
   me as a familiar friend, will repay me for all my kindness, not by
   loving obedience, but by lifting up his heel against me." The infirmity
   of sincere disciples Jesus could patiently bear with: but the
   Judas-character -- in which correct thinking and fine sentiment are
   combined with falseness of heart and practical laxity, in which to
   promise is put in place of performance, and to utter the becoming word
   about a matter is substituted for doing the appropriate deed -- such a
   character His soul utterly abhorred.

   Who can doubt that it was not in vain that sincere disciples had been
   so long in the society of One who was so exacting in His ideal, and
   that they really did strive in after years to fulfil their Master's
   will, and serve one another in love?

   [468] John vi. 66-70. The words of Jesus on the present occasion become
   clearer when viewed in the light of the earlier occurrence, comparing
   the two passages together. We are satisfied that the words, "I speak
   not of you all," mean, "I do not suspect you all of the sin of knowing
   and not doing," rather than, "You shall not all partake of the
   happiness of those who both know and do."

22. IN MEMORIAM; OR, FOURTH LESSON ON THE DOCTRINE OF THE CROSS

    Matt. 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:17-20; (I Cor. 11:23-26).

   The Lord's Supper is a monument sacred to the memory of Jesus Christ.
   "This do in remembrance of me." In Bethany Jesus had spoken as if He
   desired that Mary should be kept in remembrance in the preaching of His
   Gospel; in the supper chamber He expressed His desire to be remembered
   Himself. He would have Mary's deed of love commemorated by the
   rehearsal of her story; He would have His own deed of love commemorated
   by a symbolic action, to be often repeated throughout the ages to the
   end of the world.

   The rite of the Supper, besides commemorating, is likewise of use to
   interpret the Lord's death. It throws important light on the meaning of
   that solemn event. The institution of this symbolic feast was in fact
   the most important contribution made by Jesus during His personal
   ministry to the doctrine of atonement through the sacrifice of Himself.
   Therefrom more clearly than from any other act or word performed or
   spoken by Him, the twelve might learn to conceive of their Master's
   death as possessing a redemptive character. Thereby Jesus, as it were,
   said to His disciples: My approaching passion is not to be regarded as
   a mere calamity, or dark disaster, falling out contrary to the divine
   purpose or my expectation; not as a fatal blow inflicted by ungodly men
   on me and you, and the cause which is dear to us all; not even as an
   evil which may be overruled for good; but as an event fulfilling, not
   frustrating, the purpose of my mission, and fruitful of blessing to the
   world. What men mean for evil, God means for good, to bring to pass to
   save much people alive. The shedding of my blood, in one aspect the
   crime of wicked Jews, is in another aspect my own voluntary act. I pour
   forth my blood for a gracious end, even for the remission of sins. My
   death will initiate a new dispensation, and seal a new testament; it
   will fulfil the purpose, and therefore take the place, of the manifold
   sacrifices of the Mosaic ritual, and in particular of the Paschal lamb,
   which is even now being eaten. I shall be the Paschal Lamb of the
   Israel of God henceforth; at once protecting them from death, and
   feeding their souls with my crucified humanity, as the bread of eternal
   life.

   These truths are very familiar to us, however new and strange they may
   have been to the disciples; and we are more accustomed to explain the
   Supper by the death, than the death by the Supper. It may be useful,
   however, here to reverse the process, and, imagining ourselves in the
   position of the twelve, as witnesses to the institution of a new
   religious symbol, to endeavor to rediscover therefrom the meaning of
   the event with which it is associated, and whose significance it is
   intended to shadow forth. Let us, then, take our stand beside this
   ancient monument, and try to read the Runic inscription on its
   weather-worn surface.

   1. First, then, we perceive at once that it is to the death of Jesus
   this monument refers. It is not merely erected to His memory in
   general, but it is erected specially in memory of His decease. All
   things point forward to what was about to take place on Calvary. The
   sacramental acts of breaking the bread and pouring out the wine
   manifestly look that way. The words also spoken by Jesus in instituting
   the Supper all involve allusions to His death. Both the fact and the
   manner of His death are hinted at, by the distinction He makes between
   His body and His blood: "This is my body," "This is my blood." Body and
   blood are one in life, and become separate things only by death; and
   not by every kind of death, but by one whose manner involves
   blood-shedding, as in the case of sacrificial victims. The epithets
   applied to the body and the blood point at death still more clearly.
   Jesus speaks of His body as "given" -- as if to be slain or "broken"
   [469] in sacrifice, and of His blood as "shed." Then, finally, by
   describing the blood about to be shed as the blood of a new testament,
   the Saviour put it beyond all doubt what He was alluding to. Where a
   testament is, there must also be the death of the testator. And though
   an ordinary testator may die an ordinary death, the Testator of the new
   testament must die a sacrificial death; for the epithet new implies a
   reference to the old Jewish covenant, which was ratified by the
   sacrifice of burnt-offerings and peace-offerings of oxen, whose blood
   was sprinkled on the altar and on the people, and called by Moses "the
   blood of the covenant."

   2. The mere fact that the Lord's Supper commemorates specially the
   Lord's death, implies that that death must have been an event of a very
   important character. By instituting a symbolic rite for such a purpose,
   Jesus, as it were, said to His disciples and to us: "Fix your eyes on
   Calvary, and watch what happens there. That is the great event in my
   earthly history. Other men have monuments erected to them because they
   have lived lives deemed memorable. I wish you to erect a monument to me
   because I have died: not forgetful of my life indeed, yet specially
   mindful of my death; commemorating it for its own sake, not merely for
   the sake of the life whereof it is the termination. The memory of other
   men is cherished by the celebration of their birthday anniversaries;
   but in my case, better is the day of my death than the day of my birth
   for the purpose of a commemorative celebration. My birth into this
   world was marvelous and momentous; but still more marvelous and
   momentous is my exit out of it by crucifixion. Of my birth no festive
   commemoration is needed; but of my death keep alive the memory by the
   Holy Supper till I come again. remembering it well, you remember all my
   earthly history; for of all it is the secret, the consummation, and the
   crown."

   But why, in a history throughout so remarkable, should the death be
   thus singled out for commemoration? Was it its tragic character that
   won for it this distinction? Did the Crucified One mean the Supper
   which goes by His Name to be a mere dramatic representation of His
   passion, for the purpose of exciting our feelings, and eliciting a
   sympathetic tear, by renewing the memory of His dying sorrows? So to
   think of the matter were to degrade our Christian feast to the level of
   the pagan festival of Adonis,


   "Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured

   The Syrian damsels to lament his fate

   In amorous ditties all a summer's day."

   Or was it the foul wrong and shameful indignity done to the Son of God
   by the wicked men who crucified Him that Jesus wished to have kept in
   perpetual remembrance? Was the Holy Supper instituted for the purpose
   of branding with eternal infamy a world that knew no better use to make
   of the Holy One than to nail Him to a tree, and felt more kindness even
   for a robber than for Him? Certainly the world well deserved to be thus
   held up to reprobation; but the Son of man came not to condemn sinners,
   but to save them; and it was not in His loving nature to erect an
   enduring monument to His own resentment or to the dishonor of His
   murderers. The blood of Jesus speaketh better things than that of Abel.

   Or was it because His death on the cross, in spite of its indignity and
   shame, was glorious, as a testimony to His invincible fidelity to the
   cause of truth and righteousness, that Jesus instructed His followers
   to keep it ever in mind, by the celebration of the new symbolic rite?
   Is the festival of the Supper to be regarded as a solemnity of the same
   kind as those by which the early church commemorated the death of the
   martyrs? Is the CoenÃ¢ Domini simply the natalitia of the great
   Protomartyr? So Socinians would have us believe. To the question why
   the Lord wished the memory of His crucifixion to be specially
   celebrated in His church the Racovian Catechism replies: "Because of
   all Christ's actions, it (the voluntary enduring of death) was the
   greatest and most proper to Him. For although the resurrection and
   exaltation of Christ were far greater, these were acts of God the
   Father rather than of Christ." [470] In other words, the death above
   all things deserves to be remembered, because it was the most signal
   and sublime act of witness-bearing on Christ's part to the truth, the
   glorious copestone of a noble life of self-sacrificing devotion to the
   high and perilous vocation of a prophet.

   That Christ's death was all this is of course true, and that it is
   worthy of remembrance as an act of martyrdom is equally true; but
   whether Jesus instituted the Holy Supper for the purpose of
   commemorating His death exclusively, principally, or at all as a
   martyrdom, is a different question. On this point we must learn the
   truth from Christ's own lips. Let us return, then, to the history of
   the institution, to learn His mind about the matter.

   3. Happily the Lord Jesus explained with particular clearness in what
   aspect He wished His death to be the subject of commemorative
   celebration. In distributing to His disciples the sacramental bread, He
   said, "This is my body, given, or broken, for you;." [471] thereby
   intimating that His death was to be commemorated because of a benefit
   it procured for the communicant. In handing to the disciples the
   sacramental cup, He said, "Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of
   the new testament, shed (for you [472] and) for many for the remission
   of sins;." [473] thereby indicating the nature of the benefit procured
   by His death, on account of which it was worthy to be remembered.

   In this creative word of the new dispensation Jesus represents His
   death as a sin-offering, atoning for guilt, and purchasing forgiveness
   of moral debt. His blood was to be shed for the remission of sins. In
   view of this function the blood is called the blood of the new
   testament, in apparent allusion to the prophecy of Jeremiah, which
   contains a promise of a new covenant to be made by God with the house
   of Israel, -- a covenant whose leading blessing should be the
   forgiveness of iniquity, and called new, because, unlike the old, it
   would be a covenant of pure grace, of promises unclogged with legal
   stipulations. [474] By mentioning His blood and the new covenant
   together, Jesus teaches that, while annulling, He would at the same
   time fulfil the old, in introducing the new. The new covenant would be
   ratified by sacrifice, even as was the old one at Sinai, and remission
   of sin would be granted after blood-shedding. But in bidding His
   disciples drink the cup, the Lord intimates that after His death there
   will be no more need of sacrifices. The sin-offering of blood will be
   converted into a thank-offering of wine, a cup of salvation, to be
   drunk with grateful, joyful hearts by all who through faith in His
   sacrifice have received the pardon of their sins. Finally, Jesus
   intimates that the new covenant concerns the many, not the few -- not
   Israel alone, but all nations: it is a gospel which He bequeaths to
   sinners of mankind.

   Well may we drink of this cup with thankfulness and joy; for the "new
   covenant" (new, yet far older than the old), of which it is the seal,
   is in all respects well ordered and sure. Well ordered; for surely it
   is altogether a good and God-worthy constitution of things which
   connects the blessing of pardon with the sacrificial death of Him
   through whom it comes to us. It is good in the interests of
   righteousness: for it provides that sin shall not be pardoned till it
   has been adequately atoned for by the sacrifice of the sinner's Friend;
   and it is just and right that without the shedding of the Righteous
   One's blood there should be no remission for the unrighteous. Then this
   economy serves well the interest of divine love, as it gives that love
   a worthy career, and free scope to display its magnanimous nature, in
   bearing the burden of the sinful and the miserable. And yet once more,
   the constitution of the new covenant is admirably adapted to the great
   practical end aimed at by the scheme of redemption, viz. the elevation
   of a fallen, degraded race out of a state of corruption into a state of
   holiness. The gospel of forgiveness through Christ's death is the moral
   power of God to raise such as believe it out of the world's
   selfishness, and enmities, and baseness, into a celestial life of
   devotion, self-sacrifice, patience, and humility. If by faith in Christ
   be understood merely belief in the opus operatum of a vicarious death,
   the power of such a faith to elevate is more than questionable. But
   when faith is taken in its true scriptural sense, as implying not only
   belief in a certain transaction, the endurance of death by one for
   others, but also, and more especially, hearty appreciation of the
   spirit of the deed and the Doer, then its purifying and ennobling power
   is beyond all question. "The love of Christ constraineth me;." and "I
   am crucified with Christ," as the result of such faith.

   How poor is the Socinian scheme of salvation in comparison with this of
   the new covenant! In that scheme pardon has no real dependence on the
   blood of Jesus: He died as a martyr for righteousness, not as a
   Redeemer for the unrighteous. We are forgiven on repenting by a simple
   word of God. Forgiveness cost the Forgiver no trouble or sacrifice;
   only a word, or stroke of the pen signing a document, "Thus saith the
   Lord." What a frigid transaction! What cold relations it implies
   between the Deity and His creatures! How vastly preferable a
   forgiveness which means a giving for, [475] and costs the Forgiver
   sorrow, sweat, pain, blood, wounds, death -- a forgiveness coming from
   a God who says in effect: "I will not, to save sinners, repeal the law
   which connects sin with death as its penalty; but I am willing for that
   end to become myself the law's victim." Such a forgiveness is at once
   an act of righteousness and an act of marvelous love; whereas
   forgiveness without satisfaction, though at first sight it may appear
   both rational and generous, manifests neither God's righteousness nor
   His love. A Socinian God, who pardons without atonement, is destitute
   alike of a passionate abhorrence of sin and of a passionate love to
   sinners.

   Jesus once said, "He loveth much who hath much forgiven him." It is a
   deep truth, but there is another not less deep to be put alongside of
   it: we must feel that our forgiveness has cost the Forgiver much in
   order to love Him much. It is because they feel this that true
   professors of the catholic faith exhibit that passionate devotion to
   Christ which forms such a contrast to the cold intellectual homage paid
   by the Deist to his God. When the catholic Christian thinks of the
   tears, agonies, bloody sweat, shame, and pain endured by the Redeemer,
   of His marred vision, broken heart, pierced side, lacerated hands and
   feet, his bosom burns with devoted love. The story of the passion opens
   all the fountains of feeling; and by no other way than the via dolorosa
   could Jesus have ascended the throne of His people's hearts.

   The new covenant inaugurated by Christ's death is sure as well as
   orderly. It is reliably sealed by the blood of the Testator. For,
   first, what better guarantee can we have of the good-will of God?
   "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for
   his friends." "Hereby perceive we the love of God, because He laid down
   His life for us." Looking at the matter in the light of justice, again,
   this covenant is equally sure. God is not unrighteous, to forget His
   Son's labor of love. As He is true, Christ shall see of the travail of
   His soul. It cannot be otherwise under the moral administration of
   Jehovah. Can the God of truth break His word? Can the Judge of all the
   earth permit one, and especially His own Son, to give Himself up, out
   of purest love, to sorrow, and pain, and shame, for His brethren,
   without receiving the hire which He desires, and which was promised Him
   -- many souls, many lives, many sinners saved? Think of it: holiness
   suffering for righteousness' sake, and yet not having the consolation
   of doing something in the way of destroying unrighteousness, and
   turning the disobedient to the obedience of the just; love, by the
   impulse of its nature, and by covenant obligations, laid under a
   necessity of laboring for the lost, and yet doomed by the untowardness,
   or apathy, or faithlessness of the Governor of the universe to go
   unrewarded; -- love's labor lost, nobody the better for it, things
   remaining as before: no sinner pardoned, delivered from the pit and
   restored to holiness; no chosen people brought out of darkness into
   marvelous light! Such a state of things cannot be in God's dominions.
   The government of God is carried on in the interest of Holy Love. It
   gives love free scope to bear others' burdens: it arranges that if she
   will do so, she shall feel the full weight of the burden she takes upon
   her; but it also arranges, by an eternal covenant of truth and equity,
   that when the burden has been borne, the Burden-bearer shall receive
   His reward in the form He likes best -- in souls washed, pardoned,
   sanctified, and led to everlasting glory by Himself as His ransomed
   brethren or children.

   The principle of vicarious merit involved in the doctrine that we are
   pardoned simply because Christ died for our sins, when looked at with
   unprejudiced eyes, commends itself to reason as well as to the heart.
   It means practically a premium held out to foster righteousness and
   love. This offered premium carried Jesus through His heavy task. It was
   because, relying on His Father's promise, He saw the certain joy of
   saving many before Him, that He endured the cross. It is the same
   principle, in a restricted application of it, which stimulates
   Christians to fill up that which is behind of the sufferings of their
   Lord. They know that, if they be faithful, they shall not live unto
   themselves, but shall benefit Christ's mystic body the church, and also
   the world at large. If the fact were otherwise, there would be very
   little either of moral fidelity or of love in the world. If the moral
   government of the universe made it impossible for one being to benefit
   another by prayer or loving pains, impossible for ten good men to be a
   shield to Sodom, for the elect to be a salt to the earth, men would
   give up trying to do it; generous concern about public wellbeing would
   cease, and universal selfishness become the order of the day. Or if
   this state of things should not ensue, we should only have darkness in
   a worse form: the inscrutable enigma of Righteousness crucified without
   benefit to any living creature, -- a scandal and a reproach to the
   government and character of God. If, therefore, we are to hold fast our
   faith in the divine holiness, justice, goodness, and truth, we must
   believe that the blood of Jesus doth most certainly procure for us the
   remission of sins; and likewise, that the blood of His saints, though
   neither available nor necessary to obtain for sinners the blessing of
   pardon before the divine tribunal -- Christ's blood alone being capable
   of rendering us that service, and having rendered it effectually and
   once for all -- is nevertheless precious in God's sight, and makes the
   people precious among whom it is shed, and is by God's appointment, in
   manifold ways, a source of blessing unto a world unworthy to number
   among its inhabitants men whom it knows not how to use otherwise than
   as lambs for the slaughter.

   4] The sacrament of the Supper exhibits Christ not merely as a Lamb to
   be slain for a sin-offering, but as a Paschal Lamb to be eaten for
   spiritual nourishment. "Take, eat, this is my body." By this injunction
   Jesus taught the twelve, and through them all Christians, to regard His
   crucified humanity as the bread of God for the life of their souls. We
   must eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of man spiritually by
   faith, as we eat the bread and drink the wine literally with the mouth.

   In regarding Christ as the Bread of Life, we are not to restrict
   ourselves to the one benefit mentioned by Him in instituting the feast,
   the remission of sins, but to have in view all His benefits tending to
   our spiritual nourishment and growth in grace. Christ is the Bread of
   Life in all His offices. As a Prophet, He supplies the bread of divine
   truth to feed our minds; as a Priest, He furnishes the bread of
   righteousness to satisfy our troubled consciences; as a King, He
   presents Himself to us as an object of devotion, that shall fill our
   hearts, and whom we may worship without fear of idolatry.

   As often as the Lord's Supper is celebrated we are invited to
   contemplate Christ as the food of our souls in this comprehensive
   sense. As often as we eat the bread and drink the cup we declare that
   Christ has been, and is now, our soul's food in all these ways. And as
   often as we use this Supper with sincerity we are helped to appropriate
   Christ as our spiritual food more and more abundantly. Even as a symbol
   or picture -- mysticism and magic apart -- the Holy Supper aids our
   faith. Through the eye it affects the heart, as do poetry and music
   through the ear. The very mysticism and superstition that have grown
   around the sacraments in the course of ages are a witness to their
   powerful influence over the imagination. Men's thoughts and feelings
   were so deeply stirred they could not believe such power lay in mere
   symbols; and by a confusion of ideas natural to an excited imagination
   they imputed to the sign all the virtues of the things signified. By
   this means faith was transferred from Christ the Redeemer, and the
   Spirit the Sanctifier, to the rite of baptism and the service of the
   mass. This result shows the need of knowledge and spiritual discernment
   to keep the imagination in check, and prevent the eyes of the
   understanding from being put out by the dazzling glare of fancy. Some,
   considering how thoroughly the eyes of the understanding have been put
   out by theories of sacramental grace, have been tempted to deny that
   sacraments are even means of grace, and to think that institutions
   which have been so fearfully abused ought to be allowed to fall into
   desuetude. This is a natural re-action, but it is an extreme opinion.
   The sober, true view of the matter is, that sacraments are means of
   grace, not from any magic virtue in them or in the priest administering
   them, but as helping faith by sense, and still more by the blessing of
   Christ and the working of His Spirit, as the reward of an intelligent,
   sincere, believing use of them.

   This, then, is what we have learned from the monumental stone. The
   Lord's Supper commemorates the Lord's death; points out that death as
   an event of transcendent importance; sets it forth, indeed, as the
   ground of our hope for the pardon of sin; and finally exhibits Christ
   the Lord, who died on the Cross, as all to us which our spirits need
   for health and salvation -- our mystic bread and wine. This rite,
   instituted by Jesus on the night on which He was betrayed, He meant to
   be repeated not merely by the apostles, but by His believing people in
   all ages till He came again. So we learn from Paul; so we might have
   inferred, apart from any express information. An act so original, so
   impressive, so pregnant with meaning, so helpful to faith, once
   performed, was virtually an enactment. In performing it, Jesus said in
   effect: "Let this become a great institution, a standing observance in
   the community to be called by my Name."

   The meaning of the ordinance determines the Spirit in which it should
   be observed. Christians should sit down at the table in a spirit of
   humility, thankfulness, and brotherly love; confessing sin, devoutly
   thanking God for His covenant of grace, and His mercy to them in
   Christ, loving Him who loved them, and washed them from their sins in
   His own blood, and who daily feedeth their souls with heavenly food,
   and giving Him all glory and dominion; and loving one another -- loving
   all redeemed men and believers in Jesus as brethren, and taking the
   Supper together as a family meal; withal praying that an
   ever-increasing number may experience the saving efficacy of Christ's
   death. After this fashion did the apostles and the apostolic church
   celebrate the Supper at Pentecost, after Jesus had ascended to glory.
   Continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from
   house to house, they did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of
   heart. Would that we now could keep the feast as they kept it then! But
   how much must be done ere that be possible! The moss of Time must be
   cleared away from the monumental stone, that its inscription may become
   once more distinctly legible; the accumulated dÃ©bris of a millennium
   and a half of theological controversies about sacraments must be carted
   out of sight and mind; [476] the truth as it is in Jesus must be
   separated from the alloy of human error; the homely rite of the Supper
   must be divested of the state robes of elaborate ceremonial by which it
   has been all but stifled, and allowed to return to congenial primitive
   simplicity. These things, so devoutly to be wished, will come at last,
   -- if not on earth, in that day when the Lord Jesus will drink new wine
   with His people in the kingdom of His Father. [477]

23. JUDAS ISCARIOT

    Matt. 26:20-23; Mark 14:17-21; Luke 22:21-23; John 13:21-30.

   Besides the feet-washing and the institution of the Supper, yet another
   scene occurred on the night preceding the Lord's death, helping to
   render it forever memorable. On the same night, during the course of
   the evening meal, [478] Jesus exposed and expelled the false disciple,
   who had undertaken to deliver his Master into the hands of those who
   sought His life. Already, while occupied with the washing, He had made
   premonitory allusions to the fact that there was a traitor among the
   twelve, hinting that they were not all clean, and insinuating that
   there was one of them who knew and would not do. Having finished and
   explained the service of lowly love, He next proceeded to the unwelcome
   task of indicating distinctly to which of the disciples He had been
   alluding. With spirit troubled at thought of the painful duty, and
   shuddering in presence of such satanic wickedness, He introduced the
   subject by making the general announcement: "Verily, verily, I say unto
   you, that one of you shall betray me." Thereafter, in answer to
   inquiries, He indicated the particular individual, by explaining that
   the traitor was he to whom He should give a sop or morsel after He had
   dipped it. [479] of John's narrative.

   The fact then announced was new to the disciples, but it was not new to
   their Master. Jesus had known all along that there was a traitor in the
   camp. He had even hinted as much a full year before. But, excepting on
   that one occasion, He had not spoken of the matter hitherto, but had
   patiently borne it as a secret burden on His own heart. Now, however,
   the secret may be hid no longer. The hour is come when the Son of man
   must be glorified. Judas, for his part, has made up his mind to be the
   instrument of betraying his Lord to death; and such bad work, once
   resolved on, should by all means be done without delay. Then Jesus
   wants to be rid of the false disciple's company. He desires to spend
   the few last hours of His life in tender, confidential fellowship with
   His faithful ones, free from the irritation and distraction caused by
   the presence of an undeclared yet deadly enemy. Therefore He does not
   wait till it pleases Judas to depart; He bids him go, asserting His
   authority over him even after he has renounced his allegiance and given
   himself up to the devil's service. Reaching the sop, He says to him in
   effect: "I know thee, Judas; thou art the man: thou host resolved to
   betray me: away, then, and do it." And then He says expressly: "That
   thou does, do quickly." It was an order to go, and go at once.

   Judas took the hint. He "went immediately out," and so finally quitted
   the society of which he had been an unworthy member. One wonders how
   such a man ever got in, -- how he ever was admitted into such a holy
   fellowship, -- how he came to be chosen one of the twelve. Did Jesus
   not know the real character of this man when He chose Him? The words of
   our Lord, spoken just before, forbid us to think this. "I know," said
   He, while expounding the feet-washing, "whom I have chosen," meaning,
   evidently, to claim knowledge of them all, Judas included, at the time
   He chose them. Did He then choose Judas, knowing what he was, that He
   might have among the twelve one by whom He might be betrayed, and the
   Scriptures in that particular be fulfilled? So He seems to hint in the
   declaration just alluded to; for He goes on to say: "But that the
   scripture may be fulfilled, He that eightieth bread with me heath
   lifted up his heel against me." [480] But it is not credible that
   Iscariot was chosen merely to be a traitor, as an actor might be chosen
   by a theater manager to play the part of Iago. The end pointed at in
   the scripture quoted might be ultimately served by his being chosen,
   but that end was not the motive of the choice. We may regard these two
   points as certain: on the one hand, that Judas did not become a
   follower of Jesus with treacherous intentions; and on the other, that
   Jesus did not elect Judas to be one of the twelve because He foreknew
   that he would eventually become a traitor.

   If the choice of the false disciple was not due either to ignorance or
   to foreknowledge, how is it to be explained? The only explanation that
   can be given is, that, apart from secret insight, Judas was to all
   appearance an eligible man, and could not be passed over on any grounds
   coming under ordinary observation. His qualities must have been such,
   that one not possessing the eye of omniscience, looking on him, would
   have been disposed to say of him what Samuel said of Eliab: "Surely the
   Lord's anointed is before him." [481] In that case, his election by
   Jesus is perfectly intelligible. The Head of the church simply did what
   the church has to do in analogous instances. The church chooses men to
   fill sacred offices on a conjunct view of ostensible qualifications,
   such as knowledge, zeal, apparent piety, and correctness of outward
   conduct. In so doing she sometimes makes unhappy appointments, and
   confers dignity on persons of the Judas type, who dishonor the
   positions they fill. The mischief resulting is great; but Christ has
   taught us, by His example in choosing Judas, as also by the parable of
   the tares, that we must submit to the evil, and leave the remedy in
   higher hands. Out of evil God often brings good, as He did in the case
   of the traitor.

   Supposing Judas to have been chosen to the apostleship on the ground of
   apparent fitness, what manner of man would that imply? A vulgar,
   conscious hypocrite, seeking some mean by-end, while professedly aiming
   at a higher? Not necessarily; not probably. Rather such an one as Jesus
   indirectly described Judas to be when He made the reflection: "If ye
   know these things, happy are ye if ye do them." The false disciple was
   a sentimental, plausible, self-deceived pietist, who knew and approved
   the good, though not conscientiously practicing it; one who, in
   esthetic feeling, in fancy, and in intellect, had affinities for the
   noble and the holy, while in will and in conduct he was the slave of
   base, selfish passions; one who, in the last resource, would always put
   self uppermost, yet could zealously devote himself to well-doing when
   personal interests were not compromised -- in short, what the Apostle
   James calls a two-minded man. [482] In thus describing Judas, we draw
   not the picture of a solitary monster. Men of such a type are by no
   means so rare as some may imagine. History, sacred and profane,
   supplies numerous examples of them, playing an important part in human
   affairs. Balaam, who had the vision of a prophet and the soul of a
   miser, was such a man. Robespierre, the evil genius of the French
   Revolution, was another. The man who sent thousands to the guillotine
   had in his younger days resigned his office as a provincial judge,
   because it was against his conscience to pronounce sentence of death on
   a culprit found guilty of a capital offence. [483] A third example,
   more remarkable than either, may be found in the famous Greek
   Alcibiades, who, to unbounded ambition, unscrupulousness, and
   licentiousness, united a warm attachment to the greatest and best of
   the Greeks. The man who in after years betrayed the cause of his native
   city, and went over to the side of her enemies, was in his youth an
   enthusiastic admirer and disciple of Socrates. How he felt towards the
   Athenian sage may be gathered from words put into his mouth by Plato in
   one of his dialogues -- words which involuntarily suggest a parallel
   between the speaker and the unworthy follower of a greater than
   Socrates: "I experience towards this man alone (Socrates) what no one
   would believe me capable of, a sense of shame. For I am conscious of an
   inability to contradict him, and decline to do what he bids me; and
   when I go away I feel myself overcome by the desire of popular esteem.
   Therefore I flee from him, and avoid him. But when I see him, I am
   ashamed of my admissions, and oftentimes I would be glad if he ceased
   to exist among the living; and yet I know well, that were that to
   happen, I should be still more grieved." [484]

   The character of Judas being such as we have described, the possibility
   at least of his turning a traitor becomes comprehensible. One who loves
   himself more than any man, however good, or any cause, however holy, is
   always capable of bad faith more or less heinous. He is a traitor at
   heart from the outset, and all that is wanted is a set of circumstances
   calculated to bring into play the evil elements of his nature. The
   question therefore arises, What were the circumstances which converted
   Judas from a possible into an actual traitor?

   This is a question very hard indeed to answer. The crime committed by
   Iscariot, through which he has earned for himself "a frightful renown,"
   remains, in spite of all the discussion whereof it has been the
   subject, still mysterious and unaccountable. Many attempts have been
   made to assign probable motives for the nefarious deed, some tending to
   excuse the doer, and others to aggravate his guilt; all more or less
   conjectural, and none perfectly satisfactory. As for the Gospel
   narratives, they do not explain, but merely record, the wickedness of
   Judas. The synoptical evangelists do indeed mention that the traitor
   made a bargain with the priests, and received from them a sum of money
   for the service rendered; and John, in his narrative of the anointing
   at Bethany, takes occasion to state that the faultfinding disciple was
   a thief, appropriating to his own uses money out of the common purse,
   of which he had charge. [485] These facts, of course, show Iscariot to
   have been a covetous man. None but a man of greedy, covetous spirit
   could have taken money for such a service. A vindictive man, whose
   vanity had been wounded, or who fancied himself in some way wronged,
   might play the traitor for love of revenge, but he would scorn to be
   paid for his work. The petty pilfering from the bag was also a sure
   sign of a mean, sordid soul. Perhaps the very fact of his being the
   purse-bearer to the company of Jesus may be regarded as an indication
   that his heart hankered after greed. He got the bag to carry, we
   imagine, because the other disciples were all supremely careless about
   money matters, while he had decided proclivities towards finance, and
   showed a desire to have charge of the superfluous funds. All the rest
   would be only too glad to find a brother willing to take the trouble;
   and having imbibed the spirit of their Master's precept, Take no
   thought for the morrow, they would not think of presenting themselves
   as rival candidates for the office.

   The evangelists do therefore most distinctly represent Judas as a
   covetous man. But they do not represent his covetousness as the sole,
   or even as the principal, motive of his crime. That, indeed, it can
   hardly have been. For, in the first place, would it not have been a
   better speculation to have continued pursebearer, with facilities for
   appropriating its contents, than to sell his Master for a paltry sum
   not exceeding five pounds? [486] Then what could induce a man whose
   chief and ruling passion was to amass money to become a disciple of
   Jesus at all? Surely following Him who had no place where to lay His
   head was not a likely way to money-making! Then, finally, how account
   for the repentance of the traitor, so great in its vehemence, though
   most unholy in its nature, on the hypothesis that his sole object was
   to gain a few pieces of silver? Avarice may make a man of splendid
   talents thoroughly mercenary and unscrupulous, as is said to have been
   the case with the famous Duke of Marlborough; but it is rarely, indeed,
   that a man given up to avaricious habits takes seriously to heart the
   crimes committed under their influence. It is the nature of avarice to
   destroy conscience, and to make all things, however sacred, venal.
   Whence, then, that mighty volcanic up heaving in the breast of Judas?
   Surely other passions were at work in his soul when he sold his Lord
   than the cold and hardening love of gain!

   Pressed by this difficulty, some have suggested that, in betraying
   Jesus, Judas was actuated principally by feelings of jealousy or spite,
   arising out of internal dissensions or imagined injuries. This
   suggestion is in itself not improbable. Offences might very easily come
   from various sources. The mere fact that Judas was not a Galilean,
   [487] but a native of another province, might give rise to
   misunderstanding. Human sympathies and antipathies depend on very
   little things. Kinsmanship, a common name, or a common birthplace, have
   far more power than the grand bonds which connect us with all the race.
   In religion the same remark holds good. The ties of a common Lord, a
   common hope, and a common spiritual life, are feeble as compared with
   those of sect and sectional religious custom and opinion. Then who
   knows what offences sprang from those disputes among the disciples who
   should be the greatest in the kingdom? What if the man of Kerioth had
   been made to feel that, whoever was to be the greatest, he at least had
   no chance, not being a Galilean? The mean, narrow habits of Judas as
   treasurer would be a third cause of bad feeling in the apostolic
   company. Supposing his dishonesty to have escaped observation, his
   tendency to put the interest of the bag above the objects for which its
   contents were destined, and so to dole out supplies either for the
   company or for the poor grudgingly, would be sure to be noticed, and,
   being noticed, would certainly, in such an outspoken society, not fail
   to be remarked on. [488]

   These reflections show how ill-feeling might have arisen between Judas
   and his fellow-disciples; but what we have to account for is the hatred
   of the false disciple against his Master. Had Jesus, then, done any
   thing to offend the man by whom He was betrayed? Yes! He had seen
   through him, and that was offence enough! For, of course, Judas knew
   that he was seen through. Men cannot live together in close fellowship
   long without coming to know with what feelings they are regarded by
   each other. If I distrust a brother, he will find it out, even should I
   attempt to conceal it. But the guileless and faithful One would make no
   attempt at concealment. He would not, indeed, offensively obtrude His
   distrust on the notice of Judas, but neither would He studiously hide
   it, to make matters go smoothly between them. He who so faithfully
   corrected the faults of the other disciples would do His duty to this
   one also, and make him aware that he regarded his spirit and evil
   habits with disapprobation, in order to bring him to repentance. And
   what the effect of such dealing would be it is not difficult to
   imagine. On a Peter, correction had a most wholesome influence; it
   brought him at once to a right mind. In the case of a Judas the result
   would be very different. The mere consciousness that Jesus did not
   think well of him, and still more the shame of an open rebuke, would
   breed sullen resentment and ever-deepening alienation of heart; till at
   length love was turned to hatred, and the impenitent disciple began to
   cherish vindictive passions.

   The manner in which the betrayal was gone about supports the idea that
   the agent was actuated by malicious, revengeful feelings. Not content
   with giving such information as would enable the Jewish authorities to
   get their Victim into their hands, Judas conducted the band that was
   sent to apprehend his Master, and even pointed Him out to them by an
   affectionate salutation. To one in a vengeful mood that kiss might be
   sweet; but to a man in any other mood, even though he were a traitor,
   how abhorrent and abominable! The salutation was entirely gratuitous:
   it was not necessary for the success of the plot; for the military
   detachment was furnished with torches, and Judas could have indicated
   Jesus to them while he himself kept in the background. But that way
   would not satisfy a bosom friend turned to be a mortal enemy. [489]

   Along with malice and greed, the instinct of self-preservation may have
   had a place among the motives of Judas. Perfidy might be recommended by
   the suggestions of selfish prudence. The traitor was a shrewd man, and
   believed that a catastrophe was near. He understood better than his
   single-minded brethren the situation of affairs; for the children of
   this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.
   The other disciples, by their generous enthusiasms and patriotic hopes,
   were blinded to the signs of the times; but the false disciple, just
   because he was less noble, was more discerning. Disaster, then, being
   imminent, what was to be done? What but turn king's evidence, and make
   terms for himself, so that Christ's loss might be his gain? If this
   baseness could be perpetrated under pretense of provocation, why then,
   so much the better!

   These observations help to bring the crime of Judas Iscariot within the
   range of human experience, and on this account it was worth our while
   to make them; for it is not desirable that we should think of the
   traitor as an absolutely unique character, as the solitary perfect
   incarnation of satanic wickedness. [490] We should rather so think of
   his crime as that the effect of contemplating it on our minds shall be
   to make us, like the disciples, ask, Is it I? [491] "Who can understand
   his errors? Keep back Thy servant from presumptuous sins." There have
   been many traitors besides Judas, who, from malice or for gain, have
   played false to noble men and noble causes; some of them perhaps even
   worse men than he. It was his unenviable distinction to betray the most
   exalted of all victims; but many who have been substantially guilty of
   his sin have not taken it so much to heart, but have been able to live
   happily after their deed of villainy was wrought.

   Yet, while it is important for our warning not to conceive of Judas as
   an isolated sinner, it is also most desirable that we should regard his
   crime as an incomprehensible mystery of iniquity. It is in this light
   that the fourth evangelist would have us look at it. He could have told
   us much about the mutual relations of Judas and Jesus tending to
   explain the deed of the former. But he has not chosen to do so. The
   only explanation he gives of the traitor's crime is, that Satan had
   taken possession of him. This he mentions twice over in one chapter, as
   if to express his own horror, and to awaken similar horror in his
   readers. [492] And to deepen the impression, after relating the exit of
   Judas, he adds the suggestive reflection that it took place after
   nightfall: "He then, having received the sop, went immediately out: and
   it was night." Fit time for such an errand!

   Judas went out and betrayed his Lord to death, and then he went and
   took his own life. What a tragic accompaniment to the crucifixion was
   that suicide! What an impressive illustration of the evil of a double
   mind! To be happy in some fashion, Judas should either have been a
   better man or a worse. Had he been better, he would have been saved
   from his crime; had he been worse, he would have escaped torment before
   the time. As it was, he was bad enough to do the deed of infamy, and
   good enough to be unable to bear the burden of its guilt. Woe to such a
   man! Better for him, indeed, that he had never been born!

   What a melancholy end was that of Judas to an auspicious beginning!
   Chosen to be a companion of the Son of man, and an eye and ear witness
   of His work, once engaged in preaching the gospel and casting out
   devils; now possessed of the devil himself, driven on by him to
   damnable deeds, and finally employed by a righteous Providence to take
   vengeance on his own crime. In view of this history, how shallow the
   theory that resolves all moral differences between men into the effect
   of circumstances! Who was ever better circumstanced for becoming good
   than Judas? Yet the very influences which ought to have fostered
   goodness served only to provoke into activity latent evil.

   What a bitter cross must the constant presence of such a man as Judas
   have been to the pure, loving heart of Jesus! Yet how patiently it was
   borne for years! Herein He is an example and a comfort to His true
   followers, and for this end among others had He this cross to bear. The
   Redeemer of men had a companion who lifted up his heel against Him,
   that in this as in all other respects He might be like unto, and able
   to succor, His brethren. Has any faithful servant of Christ to complain
   that his love has been requited by hatred, his truth with bad faith; or
   that he is obliged to treat as a true Christian one whom he more than
   suspects to be a hypocrite? It is a hard trial, but let him look unto
   Jesus and be patient

   had more than they needed was the result of the love of grateful souls
   (Luke viii. 1-3), and the bag was kept that nothing might be wasted;
   for the ethics of Jesus condemn waste as strongly as they
   discountenance carefulness. "Gather up the fragments," etc.

24. THE DYING PARENT AND THE LITTLE ONES [493]
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. WORDS OF COMFORT AND COUNSEL TO THE SORROWING CHILDREN

    John 13:31-35; 14:1-4; 15-21.

   The exit of Judas into the darkness of night, on his still darker
   errand, was a summons to Jesus to prepare for death. Yet He was
   thankful for the departure of the traitor. It took a burden off His
   heart, and allowed Him to breathe and to speak freely; and if it
   brought Him, in the first place, near to His last sufferings, it
   brought Him also near to the ulterior joy of resurrection and
   exaltation to glory. Therefore His first utterance, after the departure
   took place, was an outburst of unfeigned gladness. When the false
   disciple was gone out, and the sound of his retiring footsteps had died
   away, Jesus said: "Now is the Son of man glorified: and God is
   glorified in Him; and God shall glorify Him in Himself, yea, He shall
   straightway glorify Him." [494]

   But while, by a faith which substantiated things hoped for, and made
   evident things not visible, Jesus was able to see in present death
   coming glory, He remembered that He had around Him disciples to whom,
   in their weakness, His decease and departure would mean simply
   bereavement and desolation. Therefore He at once turned His thoughts to
   them, and proceeded to say to them such things as were suitable to
   their inward state and their outward situation.

   In His last words to His own the Saviour employed two different styles
   of speech. First, He spoke to them as a dying parent addressing his
   children; and then He assumed a loftier tone, and spoke to them as a
   dying Lord addressing His servants, friends, and representatives. The
   words of comfort and counsel spoken by Jesus in the former capacity, we
   find in the passages cited from the thirteenth and fourteenth chapters
   of John's Gospel; while the directions of the departing Lord to His
   future Apostles are recorded in the two chapters which follow. We have
   to consider in this chapter the dying Parent's last words to His
   sorrowing children.

   These, it will be observed, were not spoken in one continuous address.
   While the dying Parent spake, the children kept asking Him child's
   questions. First one, then another, then a third, and then a fourth,
   asked Him a question, suggested by what He had been saying. To these
   questions Jesus listened patiently, and returned answer as He could.
   The answers He gave, and the things He meant to say without reference
   to possible interrogations, are mixed up together in the narrative. It
   will be convenient for our purpose to separate these from those, and to
   consider first, taken together, the words of comfort spoken by Jesus to
   His disciples, and then their questionings of Him, with the replies
   which these elicited. This method will make these words stand out in
   all their exquisite simplicity and appropriateness. To show how very
   simple and suitable they were, we may here state them in the fewest
   possible words. They were these: 1. I am going away; in my absence find
   comfort in one another's love (xiii. 31-35). 2. I am going away; but it
   is to my Father's house, and in due season I will come back and take
   you thither (xiv. 1-4). 3. I am going away; but even when I am away I
   will be with you in the person of my alter ego, the Comforter (xiv.
   15-21).

   Knowing to whom He speaks, Jesus begins at once with the nursery
   dialect. He addresses His disciples not merely as children, but as
   "little children;." by the endearing name expressing His tender
   affection towards them, and His compassion for their weakness. Then He
   alludes to His death in a delicate roundabout way, adapted to childish
   capacity and feelings. He tells them He is going a road they cannot
   follow, and that they will miss Him as children miss their father when
   he goes out and never returns. "Yet a little while I am with you. Ye
   shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot
   come; so now I say to you."

   After this brief, simple preface Jesus went on to give His little ones
   His first dying counsel, viz. that they should love one another in His
   absence. Surely it was a counsel well worthy to come first! For what
   solace can be greater to orphaned ones than mutual love? Let the world
   be ever so dark and cheerless, while brothers in affliction are true
   brothers to each other in sympathy and reciprocal helpfulness, they
   have an unfailing well-spring of joy in the desert of sorrow. If, on
   the other hand, to all the other ills of life there be added
   alienation, distrust, antagonism, the bereaved are desolate indeed;
   their night of sorrow hath not even a solitary star to alleviate its
   gloom. [495]

   Anxious to secure due attention to a precept in itself most seasonable,
   and even among the disciples needing enforcement, Jesus conferred on it
   all the dignity and importance of a new commandment, and made the love
   enjoined therein the distinctive mark of Christian discipleship. "A new
   commandment," said He, "I give unto you, that ye love one another;."
   thus, on that memorable night, adding a third novelty to those already
   introduced -- the new sacrament and the new covenant. The commandment
   and the covenant were new in the same sense; not as never having been
   heard of before, but as now for the first time proclaimed with the due
   emphasis, and assuming their rightful place of supremacy above the
   details of Mosaic moral legislation and the shadowy rites of the legal
   religious economy. Now love was to be the outstanding royal law, and
   free grace was to antiquate Sinaitic ordinances. And why now? In both
   cases, because Jesus was about to die. His death would be the seal of
   the New Testament, and it would exemplify and ratify the new
   commandment. Hence He goes on to say, after giving forth that new law,
   "as I have loved you." The past tense is not to be interpreted strictly
   here: the perfect must be taken as a future perfect, so as to include
   the death which was the crowning act of the Saviour's love. "Love one
   another," Jesus would say, "as I shall have loved you, and as ye shall
   know that I have loved you when ye come to need the consolation of so
   loving each other." So understanding His words, we see clearly why He
   calls the law of love new. His own love in giving His life for His
   people was a new thing on earth; and a love among His followers, one
   towards another, kindred in spirit and ready to do the same thing if
   needful, would be equally a novelty at which the world would stare,
   asking in wonder whence it came, till at length it perceived that the
   men who so loved had been with Jesus.

   The second word of comfort spoken by Jesus to the little ones He was
   about to leave was, in its general aspect, an exhortation to faith:
   "Let not your heart be troubled; believe in God, and believe in me;."
   in its more special aspect a promise that He would return to take them
   to be with Him for ever. [496] The exhortation embraces in its scope
   the whole interests of the disciples, secular and spiritual, temporal
   and eternal. Their dying Master recommends them first to exercise faith
   in God, mainly with reference to temporal anxieties. He says to them,
   in effect: "I am going to leave you, my children; but be not afraid.
   You shall not be in the world as poor orphans, defenceless and
   unprovided for; God my Father will take care of you; trust in Divine
   Providence, and let peace rule in your hearts." Having thus exhorted
   them to exercise faith in God the Provider, Jesus next exhorts His
   little ones to believe in Himself, with special reference to those
   spiritual and eternal interests for the sake of which they had left all
   and followed Him. "Believing in God for food and raiment, believe in me
   too, and be assured that all I said to you about the kingdom and its
   joys and rewards is true. Soon ye will find it very hard to believe
   this: it will seem to you as if the promises I made were deceptive, and
   the kingdom a dream and a hallucination. But do not allow such dark
   thoughts to take possession of your minds: recollect what you know of
   me; and ask yourselves whether it is likely that He whose companions
   you have been during these years would deceive you with romantic
   promises that were never to be fulfilled."

   The kingdom and its rewards; these were the things which Jesus had
   encouraged His followers to expect. Of these, accordingly, He proceeded
   next to speak, in the style suited to the character he had assumed, --
   that, viz., of a dying parent addressing his children. "In my Father's
   house," said He, "are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you,
   and I will come again, and receive you unto myself." Such, in its more
   specific form, was the second word of consolation. What a cheering
   prospect it held out to the disciples! In the hour of despondency the
   little ones would think themselves orphans, without a home either in
   earth or in heaven. But their Friend assures them that they should not
   merely have a home, but a splendid one; not merely a humble shed to
   shelter them from the storm, but a glorious palace to reside in, in a
   region where storms were unknown, -- a house with a great many rooms in
   it, supplying abundant accommodation for them all, incomparably more
   capacious than the temple which had been the earthly dwelling-place of
   God. His own death, which would appear to them so great a calamity,
   would simply mean His going before to prepare for them a place in that
   splendid mansion, and in due season His departure would be followed by
   a return to take them to be with Himself. [497] What was implied in
   preparing a place when He should come again, He did not explain. He
   only added, as if coaxing them to take a cheerful view of the
   situation, "Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know;." meaning, Think
   whither I go, to the Father, and think of my death as merely the way
   thither: and so let not my absence from the world make you sad, nor my
   death seem something dreadful.

   To the student of New Testament theology, interested in tracing the
   resemblances and contrasts in different types of doctrine, this second
   word of consolation spoken by Christ to His disciples has special
   interest, as containing substantially the idea of a Forerunner, one of
   the striking thoughts of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The writer of that
   epistle tells his Hebrew readers that Jesus has gone into heaven not
   merely as a High Priest, but as a Forerunner, [498] this being one of
   the novelties and glories of the new dispensation; for no high priest
   of Israel went into the Most Holy Place as a forerunner, but only as a
   substitute, going for the people into a place whither they might not
   follow him. Jesus, on the other hand, goes into the heavenly sanctuary,
   not only for us, but before us, going into a place whither we may
   follow Him; no place being screened off, barred, or locked against us.
   Similar is the thought which the fourth evangelist puts into the mouth
   of Jesus here, speaking as the great High Priest of humanity.

   These child-like yet profound sayings of the Lord Jesus are not only
   cheering, but most stimulating to the imagination. The "many mansions"
   suggest many thoughts. We think with pleasure of the vast numbers which
   the many-mansioned house is capable of containing. We may too,
   harmlessly, though perhaps fancifully, with the saints of other ages,
   think of the lodgings in the Father's house as not only many in number,
   but also as many in kind, corresponding to the classes or ranks of the
   residents. [499] But to some the most comfortable thought of all
   suggested by this pregnant poetic word is the certainty of an eternal
   life. To men who have doubted concerning the life beyond, the grand
   desideratum is not detailed information respecting the site, and the
   size, and the architecture of the celestial city, but to know for
   certain that there is such a city, that there is an house not made with
   hands eternal in the heavens. This desideratum is supplied in this word
   of Christ. For whatever the many mansions may mean besides, they do at
   the least imply that there is a state of happy existence to be reached
   by believers, as He in whom they believe reached it, viz. through
   death. The life everlasting, whatever its conditions, is undoubtedly
   taught here. And it is taught with authority. Jesus speaks as one who
   knows, not (like Socrates) as one who merely has an opinion on the
   subject. At his farewell meeting with his friends before he drank the
   hemlock cup, the Athenian sage discussed with them the question of the
   immortality of the soul. On that question he strongly maintained the
   affirmative; but still only as one who looked on it as a fair subject
   for discussion, and knew that there was a good deal to be said on both
   sides. But Jesus does more than maintain the affirmative on the subject
   of the life to come. He speaks thereon with oracular confidence,
   offering to us not the frail raft of a probable opinion, whereon we may
   perilously sail down the stream of life towards death; but the strong
   ship of a divine word, wherein one may sail securely, for which
   Socrates and his companions sighed. [500] And He so speaks with a full
   sense of the responsibility He thereby takes upon Himself. "If it were
   not so," He remarked to His disciples, "I would have told you;." which
   is as much as to say, that one should not encourage such expectations
   as He had led them to entertain unless he were sure of his ground. It
   was not enough to have an opinion about the world to come: one who took
   the responsibility of asking men to leave this present world for its
   sake should be quite certain that it was a reality, and not a dream.
   What condescension to the weakness of the disciples is shown in this
   self-justifying reflection of their Lord! What an aid also it lends to
   our faith in the reality of future bliss! For such an one as Jesus
   Christ would not have spoken in this way unless He had possessed
   authentic information about the world beyond.

   In the third word of consolation, the leading thought is the promise of
   another Comforter, who should take the place of Him who was going away,
   and make the bereaved feel as if He were still with them. In the second
   word of comfort Jesus had said that He was going to provide a home for
   the little ones, and that then He would return and take them to it. In
   this third final word He virtually promises to be present with them by
   substitute, even when He is absent. "I will pray the Father," He says,
   "and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you
   for ever" [501] (not for a season, as has been the case with me). Then
   He tells them who this wonderful Comforter is: His name is "the Spirit
   of Truth." [502] Then, lastly, He gives them to understand that this
   Spirit of Truth will be a Comforter to them, by restoring, as it were,
   the consciousness of His own presence, so that the coming of this other
   Comforter will just be, in a sense, His own spiritual return. "I will
   not leave you comfortless," He assures them: "I will not leave you
   orphans, I will come to you;." [503] promising thereby not a different
   thing, but the same thing which He had promised just before, in
   different terms. How the other Comforter would make Himself an alter
   ego of the departed one, He does not here distinctly explain. [504] At
   a subsequent stage in His discourse He did inform His disciples how the
   wonder would be achieved. The Spirit would make the absent Jesus
   present to them again, by bringing to their remembrance all His words,
   [505] by testifying of Him, [506] and by guiding them into an
   intelligent apprehension of all Christian truth. [507] All this, though
   not said here, is sufficiently hinted at by the name given to the new
   Paraclete. He is called the Spirit of Truth, not the Holy Spirit, as
   elsewhere, because He was to comfort by enlightening the minds of the
   disciples in the knowledge of Christ, so that they should see Him
   clearly by the spiritual eye, when He was no longer visible to the eye
   of the body.

   This spiritual vision, when it came, was to be the true effectual
   consolation for the absence of the Jesus whom the eleven had known
   after the flesh. It would be as the dawn of day, which banishes the
   fears and discomforts of the night. While the night lasts, all comforts
   are but partial alleviations of discomfort. A father's hand and voice
   have a reassuring effect on the timid heart of his child, as they walk
   together by night; but while the darkness lasts, the little one is
   liable to be scared by objects dimly seen, and distorted by
   fear-stricken fancy into fantastic forms. "In the night-time men (much
   more children) think every bush a thief;." and all can sympathize with
   the sentiment of Rousseau, "It is my nature to be afraid of darkness."
   Light is welcome, even

   when it only reveals to us the precise nature and extent of our
   miseries. If it do not in that case drive sorrow away, it helps at
   least to make it calm and sober. Such cold comfort, however, was not
   what Jesus promised His followers. The Spirit of Truth was not to come
   merely to show them their desolation in all its nakedness, and to
   reconcile them to it as inevitable, by teaching them to regard their
   early hopes as romantic dreams, the kingdom of God as a mere ideal, and
   the death of Jesus as the fate that awaits every earnest attempt to
   realize that ideal. Miserable comfort this! to be told that all earnest
   religion must end in infidelity, and all enthusiasm in despair!

   The third word of consolation was introduced by an injunction laid by
   Jesus on His disciples. "If ye love me," said He to them, "keep my
   commandments." It is probable that the speaker meant here to set the
   true way of showing love over against an unprofitable, bootless one,
   which His hearers were in danger of taking; that, namely, of grieving
   over His loss. We may paraphrase the words so as to indicate the
   connection of thought somewhat as follows: "If ye love me, show not
   your love by idle sorrow, but by keeping my commandments, whereby ye
   shall render to me a real service. Let the precepts which I have taught
   you from time to time be your concern, and be not troubled about
   yourselves. Leave your future in my hands; I will look after it: for I
   will pray the Father, and he will send you another Comforter." [508]

   But this paraphrase, though true so far as it goes, does not exhaust
   the meaning of this weighty word. Jesus prefaces the promise of the
   Comforter by an injunction to keep His commandments, because He wishes
   His disciples to understand that the fulfilment of the promise and the
   keeping of the commandments go together. This truth is hinted at by the
   word "and," which forms the link of connection between precept and
   promise; and it is reiterated under various modes of expression in the
   passage we are now considering. The necessity of moral fidelity in
   order to spiritual illumination is plainly taught when the promised
   Comforter is described as a Spirit "whom the world cannot receive,
   because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him." [509] It is still more
   plainly taught in the last verse of this section: "He that hath my
   commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that
   loveth me shall be loved of my Father; and I will love him, and will
   manifest myself to him." [510] As in His first great sermon (on the
   mount) Jesus had said, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall
   see God;." so, in His farewell discourse to His own, He says in effect:
   Be pure in heart, and through the indwelling Spirit of Truth ye shall
   see me, even when I am become invisible to the world. [511]

   Life and light go together: such is the doctrine of the Lord Jesus, as
   of all Scripture. Keeping in mind this great truth, we comprehend the
   diverse issues of religious perplexities; in one resulting in the
   illuminism of infidelity; in another, in an enlightened, unwavering
   faith. The "illumination" which consists in the extinction of the
   heavenly luminaries of faith and hope is the penalty of not faithfully
   keeping Christ's commandments; that which consists in the restoration
   of spiritual lights after a temporary obscuration by the clouds of
   doubt is the reward of holding fast moral integrity when faith is
   eclipsed, and of fearing God while walking in darkness. A man, e.g.,
   who, having believed for a time the divinity of Christ and the life to
   come, ends by believing that Jesus was only a deluded enthusiast, and
   that the divine kingdom is but a beautiful dream, will not be found to
   have made any great effort to realize his own ideal, certainly not to
   have been guilty of the folly of suffering for it. To many, the creed
   which resolves all religion into impracticable ideals is very
   convenient. It saves a world of trouble and pain; it permits them to
   think fine thoughts, without requiring them to do noble actions, and it
   substitutes romancing about heroism in the place of being heroes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [494] John xiii. 31, 32. The words ei ho Theos edoxasthe en auto are
   regarded as spurious by Luthardt and other critics.

   [495] Sanday, Authorship and Historical Character of the Fourth Gospel,
   p. 219, says, "Verses 34, 35 (the mandatum) come in curiously as a
   parenthesis"! This is the first instance of several in which this
   author seems to show a want of insight into the structure of the last
   discourse in its relation to the solemn circumstances of speaker and
   hearers. The mandatum surely deserved the first place among the words
   of consolation to the bereaved family.

   [496] John xiv. 1. The verb pisteuete is either clause may be either
   imperative or indicative, and four different renderings are possible.
   The rendering in the Eng. Ver. and that given above come practically to
   the same thing. Even in the indicative, Ye believe in God, an
   imperative is implied: Exercise and draw comfort from your faith in
   God.

   [497] The words of ver. 3 are the Johannine equivalent for the promise
   of the second coming to set up the kingdom in glory, and to make the
   disciples partakers in the glory, which forms a conspicuous feature in
   the synoptical representation of Christ's teaching. They are similar in
   import to words reported in Luke as spoken by Jesus on the same
   evening: "Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations,
   and I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me,
   that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones
   judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Eschatology, and the doctrine of
   the kingdom generally, retires into the background in John's Gospel.
   The idea of a divine kingdom is not altogether wanting indeed; we find
   it in John iii. 3, xviii. 36, and in the inscription on the cross:
   "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." The Johannine equivalent for
   the idea of the kingdom is eternal life, an idea found in the
   synoptical Gospels (Matt. xvi. 25, xix. 17, xix. 29, xxv. 46), but as
   little prominent there as the idea of the kingdom is in John. The
   relation between the two ideas is this: the one, the idea of the
   kingdom, regards man as the member of a society; the other, the idea of
   eternal life, regards man as an individual. The former denotes the
   highest good as the joint possession of all its citizens; the latter as
   the separate possession of each individual soul. The retirement of the
   idea of the kingdom, with all the sensuous coloring with which it is
   painted in the synoptical narratives, may be accounted for by the late
   origin of the Fourth Gospel at the close of the first century, when the
   destruction of Jerusalem, and the spread of the gospel among the
   heathen, lay behind the aged apostle as historical facts. If it be
   asked, Could Jesus speak of the same thing on the same occasion so
   differently as He is represented doing in John xiv. 2, 3, and in Luke
   xxii. 28, 30? we may reply by asking another question, Could Jesus
   speak to the same hearers on the same occasion so differently as in
   John xiv. and John xv.? The point of view changing involves a change of
   style. The house of many mansions and the thrones are both figures or
   parables, and might both occur in one conversation or discourse.

   [498] The point is missed in the A. V. by the use of the article. The
   R. V. gives it correctly. See its version of Heb. vi. 20.

   [499] For Cyprian's opinion, see p. 256 of this work. The same idea
   occurs in IrenÃ¦us, HÃ¦res. v. 36. No doubt there is truth in this view.
   There will be Christians of various ranks in heaven -- princes and
   doorkeepers; also of various schools, High Church, Broad Church, and
   Low Church, able at last to believe each other to be Christians.

   [504] The identity of the doctrine of the Spirit in the farewell

   [511] John xiv. 19. Sanday (Fourth Gospel, p. 230) says the connection
   in ch. xiv. 12-17, though difficult, is real, but thinks there is
   hardly a place in this connection for ver. 15: "If ye love me," etc. He
   has prevented himself from seeing its relevancy by treating ch. xiv.
   12-17 as one continuous train of thought, instead of finding at ver. 15
   the beginning of a new independent thought, the second of the three
   words of consolation. Another of this author's mistaken criticisms on
   the last discourse may here be adverted to. He complains that the
   different subjects are not kept apart, but are continually crossing and
   entangling one another, later subjects being anticipated in the course
   of the earlier, and the earlier returning to the later. As an
   illustration of this, he refers to the description of the functions of
   the Paraclete, which he thinks unnecessarily broken up into five
   fragments (ch. xiv. 16, 17; 25, 26; xv. 26; xvi. 8-16; 23-25). The fact
   is undoubted; but instead of making against the historical accuracy of
   John's record, it rather is in favor of it. If the farewell discourse
   had been a didactical composition, mainly the product of the writer's
   mind, the doctrine of the Paraclete probably would have been given in
   one continuous paragraph. But in a familiar conversation, such as the
   discourse is given out for, such occasional and fragmentary references
   to the Comforter are to be expected. The only question that can be
   properly raised is, Does what is said at each place fit into the
   connection of thought? We trust our exposition will satisfy our readers
   on that point. Certainly, if our view of the discourse, as divided into
   two parts, in which Jesus addressed the disciples first as children,
   then as His future representatives, be correct, references to the
   Comforter were sure to be made in both parts: in the former, to the
   Comforter as in the place of the absent Head of the family; in the
   latter, to the same Comforter as the illuminator and fellow-worker of
   the apostles.

  SECTION II. THE CHILDREN'S QUESTION, AND THE ADIEU

    John xiii. 36-38, xiv. 5-7, 8-14, 22-31.

   The questions put successively by four of the little ones to their
   dying Parent now invite our attention.

   The first of these was asked by the disciple who was ever the most
   forward to speak his mind -- Simon Peter. His question had reference to
   the intimation made by Jesus about His going away. Peter had noted and
   been alarmed by that intimation. It seemed to hint at danger; it
   plainly spoke of separation. Tormented with uncertainty, terrified by
   the vague presentiment of hidden peril, grieved at the thought of being
   parted from his beloved Master, he could not rest till he had
   penetrated the mystery; and at the very first pause in the discourse he
   abruptly inquired, "Lord, whither goest Thou?" thinking, though he did
   not say, "Where Thou goest, I will go."

   It was to this unexpressed thought that Jesus directed His reply. He
   did not say where He was going; but, leaving that to be inferred from
   His studied reserve, and from the tone in which He spoke, He Simply
   told Peter: "Whither I go, thou cast not follow me now, but thou shalt
   follow me afterwards." By this answer He showed He had not forgotten
   that it was with children He had to deal. He does not look for heroic
   behavior on the part of Peter and his brother disciples at the
   approaching crisis. He does indeed expect that they shall play the hero
   by and by, and follow Him on the martyr's path bearing their cross, in
   accordance with the law of discipleship proclaimed by Himself in
   connection with the first announcement of His own death. But meantime
   He expects them to behave simply as little children, running away in
   terror when the moment of danger arrives.

   While this was the idea Jesus had of Peter, it was not the idea which
   Peter had of himself. He thought himself no child, but a man every
   inch. Dimly apprehending what following his Master meant, he deemed
   himself perfectly competent to the task now, and felt almost aggrieved
   by the poor opinion entertained of his courage. "Why," he therefore
   asked in a tone of injured virtue, "Lord, why cannot I follow Thee
   now?" Is it because there is danger, imprisonment, death, in the path?
   If that be all, it is no good reason, for "I will lay down my life for
   Thy sake." Ah, that "why," how like a child; that self-confidence, what
   an infallible mark of spiritual weakness!

   If the answer of Jesus to Peter's fist question was indirect and
   evasive, that which He gave to his second was too plain to be mistaken.
   "Wilt thou," He said, taking up the disciple's words, -- " Wilt thou
   lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The
   cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice." [512] Better for
   Peter had he been content with the first reply! Yet no: not better,
   only pleasanter for the moment. It was good for Peter to be thus
   bluntly told what his Lord thought of him, and to be shown once for all
   his own picture drawn by an unerring hand. It was just what was needed
   to lead him to self-knowledge, and to bring on a salutary crisis in his
   spiritual history. Already more than once he had been faithfully dealt
   with for faults springing from his characteristic vices of forwardness
   and self-confidence. But such correction in detail had produced no deep
   impression, no decisive lasting effect on his mind. He was still
   ignorant of himself, still as forward, self-confident, and self-willed
   as ever, as the declaration he had just made most clearly showed. There
   was urgent need, therefore, for a lesson that would never be forgotten;
   for a word of correction that would print itself indelibly on the
   erring disciple's memory, and bear fruit throughout his whole after
   life. And here it is at last, and in good season. The Lord tells His
   brave disciple that he will forthwith play the coward; He tells His
   attached disciple, to whom separation from his Master seems more
   dreadful than death, that he will, ere many hours are past, deny all
   acquaintance or connection with Him whom he so fondly loves. He tells
   him all this at a time when the prophecy must be followed by its
   fulfilment almost as fast as a flash of lightning is followed by its
   peal of thunder. The prediction of Jesus, so minutely circumstantial,
   and the denial of Peter, so exactly corresponding, both by themselves
   so remarkable, and coming so close together, will surely help to make
   each other impressive; and it will be strange indeed if the two
   combined do not, by the blessing of God, in answer to the Master's
   intercessory prayer, make of the fallen disciple quite another man. The
   result will doubtless prove the truth of another prophetic word
   reported by Luke as having been spoken by the Lord to His disciple on
   the same occasion. [513] The chaff will be separated from the wheat in
   Peter's character; he will undergo a great change of spirit; and being
   converted from self-confidence and self-will to meekness and modesty,
   he will be fit at length to strengthen others, to be a shepherd to the
   weak, and, if needful, to bear his cross, and so follow his Master
   through death to glory.

   The second question proceeded from Thomas, the melancholy disciple,
   slow to believe, and prone to take sombre views of things. The mind of
   this disciple fastened on the statement wherewith Jesus concluded His
   second word of consolation: "Whither I go, the way ye know." That
   statement seemed to Thomas not only untrue, but unreasonable. For
   himself, he was utterly unconscious of possessing the knowledge for
   which the speaker had given His hearers credit; and, moreover, he did
   not see how it was possible for any of them to possess it. For Jesus
   had never yet distinctly told them whither He was going; and not
   knowing the terminus ad quem, how could any one know the road which led
   thereto? Therefore, in a dry, matter-of-fact, almost cynical tone, this
   second interlocutor remarked: "Lord, we know not whither Thou goest,
   and how can we know the way?" [514]

   This utterance was thoroughly characteristic of the man, as we know him
   from John's portraiture. [515] While the practical-minded Peter asks
   Jesus where He is going, determined if possible to follow Him, Thomas
   does not think it worth his while to make any such inquiry. Not that he
   is unconcerned about the matter. He would like well to know whither his
   Lord is bound; and, if it were possible, he would be as ready as his
   brother disciple to keep Him company. Danger would not deter him. He
   had said once before, "Let us go, that we may die with Him," and he
   could say the same thing honestly again; for though he is gloomy, he is
   not selfish or cowardly. But just as on that earlier occasion, when
   Jesus, disregarding the warnings of His disciples, resolved to go from
   PerÃ¦a to JudÃ¦a on a visit to the afflicted family of Bethany, Thomas
   took the darkest view of the situation, and looked on death as the
   certain fate awaiting them all, so now he resigns himself to a
   hopeless, desponding mood. The thought of the Master's departure makes
   him so sad that he has no heart to ask questions concerning the why or
   the whitherward. He resigns himself to ignorance on these matters as an
   inevitable doom. Whither? whither? I know not; who can tell? The future
   is dark. The Father's house you spoke of, where in the universe can it
   be? Is there really such a place at all?

   Even the question put by Thomas, "How can we know the way?" is not so
   much a question as an apology for not asking questions. It is not a
   demand for information, but a gentle complaint against Jesus for
   expecting His disciples to be informed. It is not the expression of a
   desire for knowledge, but an excuse for ignorance. The melancholy
   disciple is for the present hopeless of knowing either end or way, and
   therefore he is incurious and listless. Far from seeking light, he is
   rather in the humor to exaggerate the darkness. As Jonah in his angry
   mood indulged in querulousness, so Thomas in his sadness delights in
   gloom. He waits not eagerly for the dawn of day; he rather takes
   pleasure in the night, as congenial to his present frame of mind. Good
   men of melancholic temperament are, at the best, like men walking amid
   the solemn gloom of a forest. Sadness is the prevailing feeling in
   their souls, and they are content to have occasional broken glimpses of
   heaven, like peeps of the sky through the leafy roof of the wood. But
   Thomas is so heavy-hearted that he hardly cares even for a glimpse of
   the celestial world; he looks not up, but walks through the dark forest
   at a slow pace, with his eyes fixed upon the ground.

   The argumentative proclivities [516] of this disciple appear in his
   words as well as his proneness to despondency. Another man in
   despairing mood might have said: We know neither end nor way; we are
   utterly in the dark both as to whither you are going, and as to the
   road by which you are to go thither. But Thomas must needs reason; his
   mental habit leads him to represent one piece of ignorance as the
   necessary consequence of another: We know not the terminus ad quem, and
   therefore it is impossible that we can know the way. This man is
   afflicted with the malady of thought; he gives reasons for every thing,
   and he will demand reasons for every thing. Here he demonstrates the
   impossibility of a certain kind of knowledge; at another crisis we
   shall find him insisting on palpable demonstration that his Lord is
   indeed risen from the dead.

   How does Jesus reply to the lugubrious speech of Thomas? Most
   compassionately and sympathetically, now as at another time. To the
   curious question of Peter He returned an evasive answer; to the
   sad-hearted Thomas, on the other hand, He vouchsafes information which
   had not been asked. And the information given is full even to
   redundancy. The disciple had complained of ignorance concerning the
   end, and especially concerning the way; and it would have been a
   sufficient reply to have said, The Father is the end, and I am the way.
   But the Master, out of the fulness of His heart, said more than this.
   With firm, emphatic tones He uttered this oracular response, meant for
   the ear not of Thomas alone, but of all the world: "I am the way, and
   the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me."

   Comparing this momentous declaration with the preceding word of
   consolation, we observe a change in the mode of presenting the truth.
   The Father Himself takes the place of the Father's house with its many
   mansions, as the end; and Jesus, instead of being the guide who shall
   one day lead His children to the common home, becomes Himself the way.
   The kind Master alters His language, in gracious accommodation to
   childish capacities. Of Christians at the best it may be said, in the
   words of Paul, that now, in this present time-life, they see the
   heavenly and the eternal as through a glass, in enigmas. [517] But the
   disciples at this crisis in their history were not able to do even so
   much. Jesus had held up before their eyes the brightly-polished mirror
   of a beautiful parable concerning a house of many mansions, and they
   had seen nothing there; no image, but only an opaque surface. The
   future remained dark and hidden as before. What, then, was to be done?
   Just what Jesus did. Persons must be substituted for places. Disciples
   weak in faith must be addressed in this fashion: Can ye not comprehend
   whither I am going? Think, then, to whom I go. If ye know nothing of
   the place called heaven, know at least that ye have a Father there. And
   as for the way to heaven, let that for you mean me. Knowing me, ye need
   no further knowledge; believing in me, ye may look forward to the
   future, even to death itself, without fear or concern.

   On looking more narrowly into the response given by Jesus to Thomas, we
   find it by no means easy to satisfy ourselves as to how precisely it
   should be expounded. The very fulness of this saying perplexes us; it
   is dark with excess of light. Interpreters differ as to how the Way,
   the Truth, and the Life are to be distinguished, and how they are
   related to each other. One offers, as a paraphrase of the text: I am
   the beginning, the middle, and the end of the ladder which leads to
   heaven; another: I am the example, the teacher, the giver of eternal
   life; while a third subordinates the two last attributes to the first,
   and reads: I am the true way of life. [518] Each view is true in
   itself, yet one hesitates to accept either of them as exhausting the
   meaning of the Saviours words.

   Whatever be the preferable method of interpreting these words of our
   Lord, two things at least are clear from them. Jesus sets Himself forth
   here as all that man needs for eternal salvation, and as the only
   Saviour. He is way, truth, life, every thing; and He alone conducts to
   the Father. He says to men in effect: "What is it you want? Is it
   light? I am the light of the world, the revealer of the Father: for
   this end I came, that I might declare Him. Or is it reconciliation you
   want? I by that very death which I am about to endure am the
   Reconciler. My very end in dying is to bring you who are for off nigh
   to God, as to a forgiving, gracious Father. Or is it life, spiritual,
   never-ending life, you seek? Believe in me, and ye shall never die; or
   though ye die, I will raise you again to enter on an inheritance that
   is incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, eternal in the
   heavens. Let all who seek these things look to me. Look to me for
   light, not to rabbis or philosophers; not even to nature and
   providence. These last do indeed reveal God, but they do so dimly. The
   light of creation is but the starlight of theology, and the light of
   providence is but its moonlight, while I am the sunlight. My Father's
   Name is written in hieroglyphics in the works of creation; in
   providence and history it is written in plain letters, but so far apart
   that it takes much study to put them together, and so spell out the
   divine Name: in me the divine Name is written so that he may read who
   runs, and the wisdom of God is become milk for babes. [519] Look to me
   also for reconciliation, not to legal sacrifices. That way of
   approaching God is antiquated now. I am the new, the living, the
   eternal way into the holy of holies, through which all may draw near to
   the divine presence with a true heart, in full assurance of faith. Look
   to me, finally, for eternal blessedness. I am He who, having died,
   shall rise again, and live forevermore, and shall hold in my hands the
   keys of Hades and of death, and shall open the kingdom of heaven to all
   believers."

   The doctrine that in Christ is the fulness of grace and truth is very
   comforting to those who know Him; but what of those who know Him not,
   or who possess only such an implicit, unconscious knowledge as hardly
   merits the name? Does the statement we have been considering exclude
   such from the possibility of salvation? It does not. It declares that
   no man cometh to the Father but by Christ, but it does not say how much
   knowledge is required for salvation. [520] It is possible that some may
   be saved by Christ, and for His sake, who know very little about Him
   indeed. This we may infer from the case of the disciples themselves.
   What did they know about the way of salvation at this period? Jesus
   addresses them as persons yet in ignorance concerning Himself, saying:
   "If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also."
   Nevertheless, He has no hesitation in speaking to them as persons who
   should be with Him in the Father's house. And what shall we say of Job,
   and the Syro-Phoenician woman, and the Ethiopian eunuch, and Cornelius,
   and we may add, after Calvin, the Syrian courtier Naaman? We cannot say
   more than the great theologian of Geneva has himself said concerning
   such cases: "I confess," he writes, "that in a certain respect their
   faith was implicit, not only as to the person of Christ, but as to His
   virtue and grace, and the office assigned Him by the Father. Meanwhile
   it is certain that they were imbued with principles which gave some
   taste of Christ, however slight." [521] It is doubtful whether even so
   much can be said of Naaman; though Calvin, without evidence, and merely
   to meet the exigencies of a theory, argues that it would have been too
   absurd, when Elisha had spoken to him of little matters, to have been
   silent on the most important subject. Or if we grant to Naaman the
   slight taste contended for, must we not grant it also, with Justin
   Martyr [522] and Zwingli, to Socrates and Plato and others, on the
   principle that all true knowledge of God, by whomsoever possessed and
   however obtained, whether it be sunlight, moonlight, or starlight, is
   virtually Christian; in other words, that Christ, just because He is
   the only light, is the light of every man who hath any light in him?

   This principle, while it has its truth, may very easily be preverted
   into an argument against a supernatural revelation. Hence in its very
   first chapter, Of the Holy Scripture, the Westminster Confession
   broadly asserts that the light of nature and the works of creation and
   providence are not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and of His
   will which is necessary unto salvation. While strongly maintaining this
   truth, however, we must beware of being drawn into a tone of
   disparagement in speaking of what way be learnt of God from those lower
   sources. While walking in the sunlight, we rust not despise the dimmer
   luminaries of the night, or forget their existence, as in the day-time
   men forget the moon and the stars. By so doing we should be virtually
   disparaging the Scriptures themselves. For much that is in the Bible,
   especially in the Old Testament, is but a record of what inspired men
   had learned from observation of God's works in creation, and of His
   ways in providence. All cannot, indeed, see as much there as they saw.
   On the contrary, a revelation was needed not only to make known truths
   Iying beyond the teachings of natural religion, but even to direct
   men's dim eyes to truths which, though visible in nature, were in fact
   for the most part not seen. The Bible, in the quaint language of
   Calvin, is a pair of spectacles, through which our weak eyes see the
   glory of God in the world. [523] Yet what is seen through the
   spectacles by weak eyes is in many passages just what might be seen by
   strong eyes without their aid, -- "nothing being placed there which is
   not visible in the creation." [524]

   These observations may help us to cherish hope for those whose
   opportunities of knowing Him who is "the way, the truth, and the life"
   are small. They do not, however, justify those who, having abundant
   facilities for knowing Christ, are content with the minimum of
   knowledge. There is more hope for the heathen than for such men. To
   their number no true Christian can belong. A genuine disciple may know
   little to begin with: this was the case even with the apostles
   themselves; but he will not be satisfied to be in the dark. He will
   desire to be enlightened in the knowledge of Christ, and will pray,
   "Lord, show us the Father."

   Such was the prayer of Philip, the third disciple who took part in the
   dialogue at the supper-table. Philip's request, like Thomas's question,
   was a virtual denial of a statement previously made by Jesus. "If ye
   had known me," Jesus had said to Thomas, "ye should have known my
   Father also;." and then He had added, "and from henceforth ye know Him,
   and have seen Him." This last statement Philip felt himself unable to
   homologate. "Seen the Father! would it were so! nothing would gratify
   us more: Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us."

   In itself, the prayer of this disciple was most devout and
   praiseworthy. There can be no loftier aspiration than that which seeks
   the knowledge of God the Father, no better index of a spiritual mind
   than to account such knowledge the summum bonum, no more hopeful
   symptom of ultimate arrival at the goal than the candor which honestly
   confesses present ignorance. In these respects the sentiments uttered
   by Philip were fitted to gratify his Master. In other respects,
   however, they were not so satisfactory. The ingenuous inquirer had
   evidently a very crude notion of what seeing the Father amounted to. He
   fancied it possible, and he appears to have wished, to see the Father
   as he then saw Jesus -- as an outward object of vision to the eye of
   the body. Then, supposing that to be his wish, how foolish the
   reflection, "and it sufflceth us"! What good could a mere external
   vision of the Father do any one? And finally that same reflection
   painfully showed how little the disciples had gained hitherto from
   intercourse with Jesus. They had been with Him for years, yet had not
   found rest and satisfaction in Him, but had still a craving for
   something beyond Him; while what they craved they had, without knowing
   it, been getting from Him all along.

   Such ignorance and spiritual incapacity so late in the day were very
   disappointing. And Jesus was disappointed, but, with characteristic
   patience, not irritated. He took not offence either at Philip's
   stupidity, or at the contradiction he had given to His own statement
   (for He would rather be contradicted than have disciples pretend to
   know when they do not), but endeavored to enlighten the little ones
   somewhat in the knowledge of the Father. For this end He gave great
   prominence to the truth that the knowledge of the Father and of
   Himself, the Son, were one; that He that hath seen the Son hath seen
   the Father. The better to fix this great principle in the minds of His
   hearers, He put it in the strongest possible manner, by treating their
   ignorance of the Father as a virtual ignorance of Himself. "Have I," He
   asked, "been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me,
   Philip?" Then He went on to reason, as if to be ignorant of the Father
   was to be so far ignorant of Himself as in effect to deny His divinity.
   "Believest thou not," He again asked, "that I am in the Father, and the
   Father in me?" and then He followed up the question with a reference to
   those things which went to prove the asserted identity -- His words and
   His works. [525] Nor did He stop even here, but proceeded next to speak
   of still more convincing proofs of His identity with the Father, to be
   supplied in the marvellous works which should afterwards be done by the
   apostles themselves in His Name, and through powers granted to them by
   Himself in answer to their prayers. [526]

   The first question put by Jesus to Philip, "Hast thou not known me?"
   was something more than a logical artifice to make stupid disciples
   reflect on the contents of the knowledge they already possessed. It
   hinted at a real fact. The disciples had really not yet seen Jesus, for
   as long as they had been with Him. They knew Him, and they did not know
   Him: they knew not that they knew, nor what they knew. They were like
   children, who can repeat the Catechism without understanding its sense,
   or who possess a treasure without being capable of estimating its
   value. They were like men looking at an object through a telescope
   without adjusting the focus, or like an ignorant peasant gazing up at
   the sky on a winter night, and seeing the stars which compose a
   constellation, such as the Bear or Orion, yet not recognizing the
   constellation itself. The disciples were familiar with the words,
   parables, discourses, etc., spoken, and with the miraculous works done,
   by their Master, but they knew these only as isolated particulars; the
   separate rays of light emanating from the fountain of divine wisdom,
   power, and love in Jesus, had never been gathered into a focus, so as
   to form a distinct image of Him who came in the flesh to reveal the
   invisible God. They had seen many a star shine out in the spiritual
   heavens while in Christ's company; but the stars had not yet assumed to
   their eye the aspect of a constellation. They had no clear, full,
   consistent, spiritual conception of the mind, heart, and character of
   the man Christ Jesus, in whom dwelt all the fulness of Godhead bodily.
   Nor would they possess such a conception till the Spirit of Truth, the
   promised Comforter, came. The very thing He was to do for them was to
   show them Christ; not merely to recall to their memories the details of
   His life, but to show them the one mind and spirit which dwelt amid the
   details, as the soul dwells in the body, and made them an organic
   whole, and which once perceived, would of itself recall to recollection
   all the isolated particulars at present Iying latent in their
   consciousness. When the apostles had got that conception, they would
   know Christ indeed, the same Christ whom they had known before, yet
   different, a new Christ, because a Christ comprehended, -- seen with
   the eye of the spirit, as the former had been seen with the eye of the
   flesh. And when they had thus seen Christ, they would feel that they
   had also seen the Father. The knowledge of Christ would satisfy them,
   because in Him they should see with unveiled face the glory of the
   Lord.

   The soul-satisfying vision of God being a future good to be attained
   after the advent of the Comforter, it could not have been the intention
   of Jesus to assure the disciples that they possessed it already, still
   less to force it on them by a process of reasoning. When He said, "From
   henceforth ye know Him (the Father), and have seen Him," He evidently
   meant: "Ye now know how to see Him, viz. by reflecting on your
   intercourse with me. And the sole object of the statements made to
   Philip concerning the close relations between the Father and the
   speaker evidently was to impress upon the disciples the great truth
   that the solution of all religious difficulties, the satisfaction of
   all longings, was to be found in the knowledge of Himself. "Know me,"
   Jesus would say, "trust me, pray to me, and all shall be well with you.
   Your mind shall be filled with light, your heart shall be at rest; you
   shall have every thing you want; your joy shall be full."

   A most important lesson this; but also one which, like Philip and the
   other disciples, all are slow to learn. How few, even of those who
   confess Christ's divinity, do see in Him the true perfect Revealer of
   God! To many Jesus is one Being, and God is another and quite a
   different Being; though the truth that Jesus is divine is all the while
   honestly acknowledged. That great truth lies in the mind like an
   unfructifying seed buried deep in the soil, and we may say of it what
   has been said of the doctrine of the soul's immortality: "One may
   believe it for twenty years, and only in the twenty-first, in some
   great moment, discover with astonishment the rich contents of this
   belief, the warmth of this naphtha spring." [527] Impressions of God
   have been received from one quarter, impressions of Christ from
   another; and the two sets of impressions lie side by side in the mind,
   incompatible, yet both receiving house-room. Hence, when a Christian
   begins to carry out consistently the principle that, Jesus being God,
   to know Jesus is to know God, he is apt to experience a painful
   conflict between a new and an old class of ideas about the Divine
   Being. Two Gods -- a christianize God, and a sort of pagan divinity --
   struggle for the place of sovereignty; and when at last the conflict
   ends in the enthronement in the mind and heart of the God whom Jesus
   revealed, the day-dawn of a new spiritual life has arrived.

   One most prominent idea in the conception of God as revealed by Jesus
   Christ is that expressed by the name Father. According to the doctrine
   of our Lord and Saviour, God is not truly known till He is thought of
   and heartly believed in as a Father; neither can any God who is not
   regarded as a Father satisfy the human heart. Hence His own mode of
   speaking concerning God was in entire accordance with this doctrine. He
   did not speak to men about the Deity, or the Almighty. Those epithets
   which philosophers are so fond of applying to the Divine Being, the
   Infinite, the Absolute, etc., never crossed His lips. No words ever
   uttered by Him could suggest the idea of the gloomy arbitrary tyrant
   before whom the guilty conscience of superstitious heathenism cowers.
   He spake evermore, in sermon, parable, model prayer, and private
   conversation, of a Father. Such expressions as "the Father," "my
   Father," "your Father," were constantly on His tongue; and all He
   taught concerning God harmonized perfectly with the feelings these
   expressions were fitted to call forth.

   Yet notwithstanding all His pains, and all the beauty of His utterances
   concerning the Being whom no man hath seen, Jesus, it is to be feared,
   has only imperfectly succeeded in establishing the worship of the
   Father. From ignorance or from preference, men still extensively
   worship God under other names and categories. Some deem the paternal
   appellation too homely, and prefer a name expressive of more distant
   and ceremonious relations. The Deity, or the Almighty, suffices them.
   Philosophers dislike the appellation Father, because it makes the
   personality of God too prominent. They prefer to think of the Uncreated
   as an Infinite, Eternal Abstraction -- an object of speculation rather
   than of faith and love. Legal-minded professors of religion take fright
   at the word Father. They are not sure what they have a right to use it,
   and they deem it safer to speak of God in general terms, which take
   nothing for granted, as the Judge, the Taskmaster, or the Lawgiver. The
   worldly, the learned, and the religious, from different motives, thus
   agree in allowing to fall into desuetude the name into which they have
   been baptized, and only a small minority worship the Father in spirit
   and in truth.

   Superficial readers of the gospel may cherish the idea that the name
   Father, applied to God by Jesus, is simply or mainly a sentimental
   poetic expression, whose loss were no great matter for regret. There
   could not be a greater mistake. The name, in Christ's lips, always
   represents a definite thought, and teaches a great truth. When He uses
   the term to express the relation of the Invisible One to Himself, He
   gives us a glimpse into the mystery of the Divine Being, telling us
   that God is not abstract being, as Platonists and Arians conceived Him;
   not the absolute, incapable of relations; not a passionless being,
   without affections; but one who eternally loves, and is loved, in whose
   infinite nature the family affections find scope for ceaseless play --
   One in three: Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three persons in one divine
   substance. Then again, when He calls God Father, in reference to
   mankind in general, as He does repeatedly, He proclaims to men sunk in
   ignorance and sin this blessed truth: "God, my Father, is your Father
   too; cherishes a paternal feeling towards you, though ye be so marred
   in moral vision that He might well not know you, and so degenerate that
   He might well be ashamed to own you; and I His Son am come, your elder
   brother, to bring you back to your Father's house. Ye are not worthy to
   be called His sons, for ye have ceased to bear His image, and ye have
   not yielded Him filial obedience and reverence; nevertheless, He is
   willing to be a Father unto you, and receive you graciously in His
   arms. Believe this, and become in heart and conduct sons of God, that
   ye may enjoy the full, the spiritual and eternal, benefit of God's
   paternal love." When, finally, He calls God Father, with special
   reference to His own disciples, He assures them that they are the
   objects of God's constant, tender, and effective care; that all His
   power, wisdom, and love are engaged for their protection, preservation,
   guidance, and final eternal salvation; that their Father in heaven will
   see that they lack no good, and will make all things minister to their
   interest, and in the end secure to them their inheritance in the
   everlasting kingdom. "Fear not," is His comforting message to His
   little chosen flock, "it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the
   kingdom."

   We have now to notice the fourth and last of the children's questions,
   which was put by Judas, "not Iscariot" (he is otherwise occupied), but
   the other disciple of that name, also called Lebbaeus and Thaddaeus.
   [528]

   In His third word of consolation Jesus had spoken of a re-appearance
   (after His departure) specially and exclusively to "His own." "The
   world," He had said, "seeth me no more; but ye see me," that is, shall
   see after a little while. Now two questions might naturally be asked
   concerning this exclusive manifestation: How was it possible? and what
   was the reason of it? How could Jesus make Himself visible to His
   disciples, and yet remain invisible to all others? and granting the
   possibility, why not show Himself to the world at large? It is not easy
   to decide which of these two difficulties Judas had in his mind, for
   his question might be interpreted either way. Literally translated, it
   was to this effect: "Lord, what has happened, that Thou art about to
   manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the world?" The disciple might
   mean, like Nicodemus, to ask, "How can these things be?" or he might
   mean, "We have been hoping for the coming of Thy kingdom in power and
   glory, visible to the eyes of all men: what has led Thee to change Thy
   plans?"

   In either case the question of Judas was founded on a misapprehension
   of the nature of the promised manifestation. He imagined that Jesus was
   to reappear corporeally, after His departure to the Father, therefore
   so as to be visible to the outward eye, and not of this one or that
   one, but of all, unless He took pains to hide Himself from some while
   revealing Himself to others. [529] Neither Judas nor any of his
   brethren was capable as yet of conceiving a spiritual manifestation,
   not to speak of finding therein a full compensation, for the loss of
   the corporeal presence. Had they grasped the thought of a spiritual
   presence, they could have had no difficulty in reconciling visibility
   to one with invisibility to another; for they would have understood
   that the vision could be enjoyed only by those who possessed the inward
   sense of sight.

   How was a question dictated by incapacity to understand the subject to
   which it referred to be answered? Just as you would explain the working
   of the electric telegraph to a child. If your child asked you, Father,
   how is it that you can send a message by the telegraph to my uncle or
   aunt in America, so far, far away? you would not think of attempting to
   explain to him the mysteries of electricity. You would take him to a
   telegraph office, and bid him look at the man actually engaged in
   sending a message, and tell him, that as the man moved the handle, a
   needle in America pointed at letters of the alphabet, which, when put
   together, made up words which said just what you wished to say.

   In this way it was that Jesus answered the question of Judas. He did
   not attempt to explain the difference between a spiritual and a
   corporeal manifestation, but simply said in effect: Do you so and so,
   and what I have promised will come true. "If a man love me, he will
   keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him,
   and make our abode with him." It is just the former statement repeated,
   in a slightly altered, more pointed form. Nothing new is said, because
   nothing new can be said intelligibly. The old promise is simply so put
   as to arrest attention on the condition of its fulfilment. "if a man
   love me, he will keep my words: "attend to that, my children, and the
   rest will follow. The divine Trinity -- Father, Son, and Spirit -- will
   verily dwell with the faithful disciple, who with trembling solicitude
   strives to observe my Commandments. As for those who love me not, and
   keep not my sayings, and believe not on me, it is simply impossible for
   them to enjoy such august company. The pure in heart alone shall see
   God.

   Jesus had now spoken all He meant to say to His disciples in the
   capacity of a dying parent addressing his sorrowing children. It
   remained now only to wind up the discourse, and bid the little ones
   adieu.

   In drawing to a close, Jesus does not imagine that He has removed all
   difficulties and dispelled all gloom from the minds of the disciples.
   On the contrary, He is conscious that all He has said has made but a
   slight impression. Nevertheless, He will say no more in the way of
   comfort. There is, in the first place, no time. Judas and his band, the
   prince of this world, whose servants Judas and all his associates are,
   may now be expected at any moment, and He must hold Himself in
   readiness to go and meet the enemy. [530] Then, secondly, to add any
   thing further would be useless. It is not possible to make things any
   clearer to the disciples in their present state by any amount of
   speech. Therefore He does not attempt it, but refers them for all other
   explanations to the promised Comforter, [531] and proceeds to utter the
   words of farewell: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,"
   [532] -- words touching at all times, unspeakably affecting in the
   circumstances of the Speaker and hearers. We know not but they did more
   to comfort the dispirited little ones than all that had been said
   before. There is a pathos and a music in the very sound of them, apart
   from their sense, which are wonderfully soothing. We can imagine,
   indeed, that as they were spoken, the poor disciples were overtaken
   with a fit of tenderness, and burst into tears. That, however, would do
   them good. Sorrow is healed by weeping: the sympathy which melts the
   heart at the same time comforts it.

   This touching sympathetic farewell is more than a good wish: it is a
   promise -- a promise made by One who knows that the blessing promised
   is within reach. It is like the cheering word spoken by David to
   brothers in affliction: "Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and He
   shall strengthen twine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord." David spoke
   that word from experience, and even so does Jesus speak here. The peace
   He offers His disciples is His own peace -- "my peace:." not merely
   peace of His procuring, but peace of His experiencing. He has had peace
   in the world, in spite of sorrow and temptation, -- perfect peace
   through faith. Therefore He can assure them that such a thing is
   possible. They, too, can have peace of mind and heart in the midst of
   untoward tribulation. The world can neither understand nor impart such
   peace, the only peace it knows any thing about being that connected
   with prosperity, which trouble can destroy as easily as a breath of
   wind agitates the calm surface of the sea. But there is a peace which
   is independent of outward circumstances, whose sovereign virtue and
   blessed function it is to keep the heart against fear and care. Such
   peace Jesus had Himself enjoyed; and He gives His disciples to
   understand that through faith and singleness of mind they may enjoy it
   also.

   The farewell word is not only a promise made by One who knows whereof
   He speaks, but the promise of One who can bestow the blessing promised.
   Jesus does not merely say: Be of good cheer; ye may have peace, even as
   I have had peace, in spite of tribulation. He says moreover, and more
   particularly, Such peace as I have had I bequeath to you as a dying
   legacy, I bestow on you as a parting gift. The inheritance of peace is
   made over to the little ones by a last will and testament, though,
   being minors, they do not presently enter into actual possession. When
   they arrive at their majority they shall inherit the promise, and
   delight themselves in the abundance of peace. The after-experience of
   the disciples proved that the promise made to them by their Lord had
   not been false and vain. The apostles, as Jesus foretold, found in the
   world much tribulation; but in the midst of all they enjoyed perfect
   peace. Trusting in the Lord, and doing good, they were without fear and
   without care. In every thing, by prayer and supplication, with
   thanksgiving, they made their requests known unto God; and the peace of
   God, which passeth understanding, did verily keep their hearts and
   minds in Christ Jesus.

   Jesus had not yet said His last word to the little ones. Seeing in
   their faces the signs of grief, in spite of all that He had spoken to
   comfort them, He abruptly threw out an additional remark, which gave to
   the whole subject of His departure quite a new turn. He had been
   telling them, all through His farewell address, that though He was
   going away, He would come again to them, either personally or by
   deputy, in the body at last, in the Spirit meanwhile. He now told them,
   that apart from His return, His departure itself should be an occasion
   of joy rather than of sorrow, because of what it signified for Himself.
   "Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto
   you:." extract comfort from that promise by all means. But "if ye loved
   me (as ye ought), ye would rejoice because I said, I go unto the
   Father," [533] forgetting yourselves, and thinking what a happy change
   it would be for me. Then he added: "For my Father is greater than I."
   The connection between this clause and the foregoing part of the
   sentence is somewhat obscure, as is also its theological import. Our
   idea, however, is, that when Jesus spake these words He was thinking of
   His death, and meeting an objection thence arising to the idea of
   rejoicing in His departure. "You are going to the Father," one might
   have said -- "yes; but by what a way!" Jesus replies: The way is rough,
   and abhorrent to flesh and blood; but it is the way my Father has
   appointed, and that is enough for me; for my Father is greater than I.
   So interpreting the words, we only make the speaker hint therein at a
   thought which we find Him plainly expressing immediately after in His
   concluding sentence, where He represents His voluntary endurance of
   death as a manifestation to the world of His love to the Father, and as
   an act of obedience to His commandment.

   And now, finally, by word and act, Jesus strives to impress on the
   little children the solemn reality of their situation. First, He bids
   them mark what He has told them of His departure, that when the
   separation takes place they may not be taken by surprise. "Now I have
   told you before it come to pass, that when it is come to pass ye might
   believe." [534] Then He gives them to understand that the parting hour
   is at hand. Hereafter He will not talk much with them; there will not
   be opportunity; for the prince of this world cometh. Then He adds words
   to this effect: "Let him come; I am ready for him. He has indeed
   nothing in me; no claim upon me; no power over me; no fault which he
   can charge against me. Nevertheless, I yield myself up into his hands,
   that all men may see that I love the Father, and am loyal to His will:
   that I am ready to die for truth, for righteousness, for the
   unrighteous." [535] Then, lastly, with firm, resolute voice, He gives
   the word of command to all to rise up from the couches on which they
   have been reclining, doubtless suiting His own action to the word:
   "Arise, let us go hence." [536]

   From the continuation of the discourse, as recorded by John, as well as
   from the statement made by him at the commencement of the eighteenth
   chapter of his Gospel ("When Jesus had spoken these words, He went
   forth," etc.), we infer that the company did not at this point leave
   the supper-chamber. They merely assumed a new attitude, and exchanged
   the recumbent for a standing posture, as if in readiness to depart.
   This movement was, in the circumstances, thoroughly natural. It fitly
   expressed the resolute temper of Jesus; and it corresponded to the
   altered tone in which He proceeded to address His disciples. The action
   of rising formed, in fact, the transition from the first part of His
   discourse to the second. Better than words could have done, it altered
   the mood of mind, and prepared the disciples for listening to language
   not soft, tender, and familiar as heretofore, but stern, dignified,
   impassioned. It struck the keynote, if we may so express it, by which
   the speaker passed from the lyric to the heroic style. It said, in
   effect: Let us have done with the nursery dialect, which, continued
   longer, would but enervate: let me speak to you now for a brief space
   as men who have got to play an important part in the world. Arise;
   shake off languor, and listen, while I utter words fitted to fire you
   with enthusiasm, to inspire you with courage, and to impress you with a
   sense of the responsibilities and the honors connected with your future
   position.

   So understanding the rising from the table, we shall be prepared to
   listen along with the disciples, and to enter on the study of the
   remaining portion of Christ's farewell discourse, without any feeling
   of abruptness.

   that religion they do profess." This statement may mean either that the
   persons in question absolutely cannot be saved, -- their non-profession
   of the Christian religion excluding them from being saved in the true
   way, and all other ways being unavailable; or that they cannot be saved
   by any other way: if saved, it must be in spite of other ways, and
   through the one true way -- Christ. The statement in the first chapter,
   Of the Holy Scripture, seems to make the balance incline towards the
   former view. In that chapter the insufficiency of the light of nature
   to give that knowledge of God which is necessary for salvation is
   affirmed, and the affirmation is made the basis of the doctrine of
   revelation. The strongest statement of all is in the Larger Catechism,

   [493] Our readers will find at the end of chapter xxvi. of this work an
   analysis of the contents of the farewell discourse and intercessory
   prayer recorded in John xiii. 31-38, xiv.-xvii, which though placed at
   the end of our exposition, may perhaps profitably be consulted here. We
   have been led to prepare this table partly on account of the length of
   the exposition, which is apt to divert attention from the natural
   divisions of the subject, and prevent the impression of appropriateness
   to the situation, which it has been our aim to produce in connection
   with this part of John's record, from being as strong as we should
   wish. Partly also, however, from observing how much of the criticism on
   this composition, seems to arise out of defective insight into its
   import. We have had occasion to notice this even in writers who admit
   Johannine authorship, and recognize logia of our Lord as the germs of
   all John's free expansion; as, e.g. Dr. Sanday in his thoughtful work
   on the Authorship and Historical Character of the Fourth Gospel.
   Admitting the legitimacy of the view taken by this writer of the
   Johannine discourses in the abstract, we maintain that he has failed to
   see into the discourses, and very specially into the farewell
   discourse, has looked too much at the surface, and so has made
   criticisms which he would not have made had he looked more below the
   surface. It appears to us intrinsically credible that Jesus spoke words
   of comfort to His disciples such as are considered in Section I. of
   this chapter; words of exhortation, warning, and encouragement
   respecting their work as apostles, such as we find in John xv., xvi.;
   and the words of prayer for men on whom so such depended. The
   children's questions, considered in Section II. of this chapter, seem
   to rise naturally out of the previously spoken words of Jesus, and the
   answers to them ought to be kept apart from what Jesus meant to say,
   irrespective of interruptions.
     __________________________________________________________________

25. DYING CHARGE TO THE FUTURE APOSTLES
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. THE VINE AND ITS BRANCHES

    John 15:1-15.

   The subject of discourse in these chapters is the future work of the
   apostles, -- its nature, honors, hardships, and joys. Much that is said
   therein admits of application to Christians in general, but the
   reference in the first place is undoubtedly to the eleven then present;
   and only by keeping this in mind can we get a clear idea of the import
   of the discourse as a whole.

   The first part of this charge to the future apostles has for its object
   to impress upon them that they have a great work before them. [537] The
   keynote of the passage may be found in the words: "Ye have not chosen
   me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and
   bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain." [538] Jesus
   would have His chosen ones understand that He expects more of them than
   that they shall not lose heart when He has left the earth. They must be
   great actors in the world, and leave their mark permanently on its
   history: they must, in fact, take His place, and be in His stead, and
   carry on the work He had begun, in His name and through His aid.

   To put their duty clearly before the minds of His disciples, Jesus made
   large use of a beautiful figure drawn from the vine-tree, which He
   introduced at the very outset of His discourse. "I am the true vine;"
   that is the theme, which in the sequel is worked out with considerable
   minuteness of detail, -- figure and interpretation being freely mixed
   up together in the exposition. The question has often been asked, What
   led Jesus to adopt this particular emblem as the vehicle of His
   thoughts? and many conjectural answers have been hazarded. In absence
   of information in the narrative, however, we must be content to remain
   in ignorance on this point, without attempting to supply the missing
   link in the association of ideas. This is no great hardship; for, after
   all, what does it matter how a metaphor is suggested (a thing which
   even the person employing the metaphor often does not know), provided
   it be in itself apt to the purpose to which it is applied? Of the
   aptness of the metaphor here employed there can be no doubt in the mind
   of any one who attentively considers the felicitous use which the
   speaker made of it. [539]

   Turning our attention, then, to the discourse of Jesus on His own
   chosen text, we cannot but be struck with the manner in which He
   hurries on at once to speak of fruit. We should have expected that, in
   introducing the figure of the vine, He would in the first place state
   fully in terms of the figure how the case stood. After hearing the
   words, "I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman," we expect
   to hear, "and ye, my disciples, are the branches, through which the
   vine brings forth fruit." That, however, is not said here; but the
   speaker passes on at once to tell His hearers how the branches (of
   which no mention has been made) are dealt with by the divine
   Husbandman; how the fruitless branches, on the one hand, are lopped
   off, while the fruitful ones are pruned that they may become still more
   productive. [540] This shows what is uppermost in the mind of Jesus.
   His heart's desire is that His disciples may be spiritually fruitful.
   "Fruit, fruit, my disciples," He exclaims in effect; "ye are useless
   unless ye bear fruit: my Father desires fruit, even as I do; and His
   whole dealing with you will be regulated by a purpose to increase your
   fruitfulness."

   While urgent in His demand for fruit, Jesus does not, we observe, in
   any part of this discourse on the vine, indicate wherein the expected
   fruit consists. When we consider to whom He is speaking, however, we
   can have no doubt as to what He principally intends. The fruit He looks
   for is the spread of the gospel and the ingathering of souls into the
   kingdom of God by the disciples, in the discharge of their apostolic
   vocation. Personal holiness is not overlooked; but it is required
   rather as a means towards fruitfulness than as itself the fruit. It is
   the purging of the branch which leads to increased fertility.

   The next sentence ("Now ye are clean through the word which I have
   spoken unto you" [541] ) it seems best to regard as a parenthesis, in
   which for a moment the figure of the vine is lost sight of. The mention
   of branches which, as unproductive, are cut off, recalls to the Lord's
   thoughts the case of one who had already been cut off, -- the false
   disciple Judas, -- and leads Him naturally to assure the eleven that He
   hopes better things of them. The process of excision had already been
   applied among them in one instance: therefore they should not be
   high-minded, but fear. But, on the other hand, as He had said before in
   connection with the feet-washing, that they were clean, with one
   exception; so now He would say they were all clean, without exception,
   through the word which He had spoken to them. As branches they might
   need pruning, but there would be no occasion for cutting off.

   Having strongly declared the indispensableness of fruit-bearing in
   order to continued connection with the vine, Jesus proceeded next to
   set forth the conditions of fruitfulness, and (what we should have
   expected at the very commencement of the discourse) the relation
   subsisting between Himself and His disciples. "I am the vine," He said
   (to take the latter first), "ye are the branches." [542] By this
   statement He explains why He is so urgent that His disciples should be
   fruitful. The reason is, that they are the media through which He
   Himself brings forth fruit, serving the same purpose to Him that the
   branches serve to the vine. His own personal work had been to choose
   and train them, -- to fill them, so to speak, with he sap of divine
   truth; and their work was now to turn that sap into grapes. The Father
   in heaven, by sending Him into the world, had planted Him in the earth,
   a new, mystic, spiritual vine; and He had produced them, the eleven, as
   His branches. Now His personal ministry was at an end; and it remained
   for the branches to carry on the work to its natural consummation, and
   to bring forth a crop of fruit, in the shape of a church of saved men
   believing in His name. If they failed to do this, His labor would be
   all in vain.

   Returning now to the conditions of fruitfulness, we find Jesus
   expressing them in these terms: "Abide in me, and I in you." [543]
   These words point to a dependence of the disciples on their Lord under
   two forms, which by help of the analogy of a tree and its branches it
   is easy to distinguish. The branch abides in the vine structurally; and
   the vine abides in the branch through its sap, vitally. Both of these
   abidings are necessary to fruit-bearing. Unless the branch be
   organically connected with the stem, the sap which goes to make fruit
   cannot pass into it. On the other hand, although the branch be
   organically connected with the stem, yet if the sap of the stem do not
   ascend into it (a case which is possible and common in the natural
   world), it must remain as fruitless as if it were broken off and lying
   on the ground.

   All this is clear; but when we ask what do the two abidings signify in
   reference to the mystic vine, the answer is not quite so easy. The
   tendency here is to run the two into one, and to make the distinction
   between them merely nominal. The best way to come at the truth is to
   adhere as closely as possible to the natural analogy. What, then, would
   one say most nearly corresponded to the structural abiding of the
   branch in the tree? We reply, abiding in the doctrine of Christ, in the
   doctrine He taught; and acknowledging Him as the source whence it had
   been learned. In other words, "Abide in me" means, Hold and profess the
   truth I have spoken to you, and give yourselves out merely as my
   witnesses. The other abiding, on the other hand, signifies the
   indwelling of the Spirit of Jesus in the hearts of those who believe.
   Jesus gives His disciples to understand that, while abiding in His
   doctrine, they must also have His Spirit abiding in them; that they
   must not only hold fast the truth, but be filled with the Spirit of
   truth.

   As thus distinguished, the two abidings are not only different in
   conception, but separable in fact. On the one hand, there may be
   Christian orthodoxy in the letter where there is little or no spiritual
   life; and there may, on the other hand, be a certain species of
   spiritual vitality, a great moral, and in some respects most
   Christian-like earnestness, accompanied with serious departure from the
   faith. The one may be likened unto a dead branch on a living tree,
   bleached, barkless, moss-grown, and even in summer leafless, stretching
   out like a withered arm from the trunk into which it is inserted, and
   with which it still maintains an organic structural connection. The
   other is a branch cut off by pride or self-will from the tree, full of
   the tree's sap, and clothed with verdure at the moment of excision, and
   foolishly imagining, because it does not wither at once, that it can
   live and grow and blossom independently of the tree altogether. Have
   such things never been since Christianity began? Alas, would it were
   so! In the grand primeval forest of the Church too many dead
   orthodoxies have ever been visible; and as for branches setting up for
   the themselves, their name is legion.

   The two abidings, which we have seen to be not only separable, but
   often separated, cannot be separated without fatal effects. The result
   ever is in the end to illustrate the truth of Christ's words, "Without,
   or severed from, me ye can do nothing." [544] Dead orthodoxy is
   notoriously impotent. Feeble, timid, torpid, averse to any thing
   arduous, heroic, stirring in thought or conduct at best, it becomes at
   last insincere and demoralizing: salt without savor, fit only to be
   thrown out; worthless vine-wood, good for nothing except for fuel, and
   not worth much even for that purpose. Heresies, not abiding in the
   doctrine of Christ, are equally helpless. At first, indeed, they
   possess a spurious ephemeral vitality, and make a little noise in the
   world; but by and by their leaf begins to wither, and they bring forth
   no abiding fruit.

   The conception of a dead branch, applied to individuals as distinct
   from churches or the religious world viewed collectively, is not
   without difficulty. A dead branch on a tree was not always dead: it was
   produced by the vital force of the tree, and had some of the tree's
   life in it. Does the analogy between natural and spiritual branches
   hold at this point? Not in any sense, as we believe, that would
   compromise the doctrine of perseverance in grace, nowhere taught more
   clearly than in the words of our Lord. At the same time, it cannot be
   denied that there is such a thing as abortive religious experience.
   There are blossoms on the tree of life which are blasted by spring
   frosts, green fruits which fall off ere they ripen, branches which
   become sickly and die. Jonathan Edwards, a high Calvinist, but also a
   candid, shrewd observer of facts, remarks: "I cannot say that the
   greater part of supposed converts give reason by their conversation to
   suppose that they are true converts. The proportion may perhaps be more
   truly represented by the proportion of the blossoms on a tree which
   abide and come to mature fruit, to the whole number of blossoms in
   spring." [545] The permanency of many spiritual blossoms is here
   denied, but the very denial implies an admission that they were
   blossoms.

   That some branches should become unfruitful, and even die, while others
   flourish and bring forth fruit, is a great mystery, whose explanation
   lies deeper than theologians of the Arminian school are willing to
   admit. Yet, while this is true, the responsibility of man for his own
   spiritual character cannot be too earnestly insisted on. Though the
   Father, as the husbandman, wields the pruning-knife, the process of
   purging cannot be carried on without our consent and cooperation. For
   that process means practically the removal of moral hindrances to life
   and growth, -- the cares of life, the insidious influence of wealth,
   the lusts of the flesh, and the passions of the soul, -- evils which
   cannot be overcome unless our will and all our moral powers be brought
   to bear against them. Hence Jesus lays it upon His disciples as a duty
   to abide in Him, and have Him abiding in them, and resolves the whole
   matter at last, in plain terms, into keeping His commandments. [546] If
   they diligently and faithfully do their part, the divine Husbandman, He
   assures them, will not fail to give them liberally all things needful
   for the most abundant fruitfulness. "Ye shall ask what ye will, and it
   shall be done unto you." [547]

   The doom of branches coming short in either of the two possible ways,
   is very plainly declared by Jesus. The doom of the branch which, while
   in Him structurally, beareth not fruit, either because it is absolutely
   dead and dry, or because it is afflicted with a vice which makes it
   barren, is to be taken away -- judicially severed from the tree. [548]
   The doom of the branch which will not abide in the vine, is not to be
   cut off, -- for that it does itself, -- but to be thrown out of the
   vineyard, there to lie till it be withered, and at length, at a
   convenient season, to be gathered, along with all its self-willed,
   erratic brethren, into a heap, and burned in a bonfire like the dry
   rubbish of a garden. [549]

   In the latter portion of the discourse on the vine, [550] Jesus
   expresses His high expectations with respect to the fruitfulness of the
   apostolic branches, and suggests a variety of considerations which,
   acting on the minds of the disciples as motives, might lead to the
   fulfilment of His hopes. As to the former, He gave the disciples to
   understand that He expected of them not only fruit, but much fruit,
   [551] and fruit not only abundant in quantity, but good in quality;
   [552] fruit that should remain, grapes whose juice should be worthy of
   preservation as wine in bottles; a church that should endure till the
   world's end.

   These two requirements, taken together, amount to a very high demand.
   It is very hard indeed to produce fruit at once abundant and enduring.
   The two requirements to a certain extent limit each other. Aiming at
   high quality leads to undue thinning of the clusters, while aiming at
   quantity may easily lead to deterioration in the quality of the whole.
   The thing to be studied is to secure as large an amount of fruit as is
   consistent with permanence; and, on the other hand, to cultivate
   excellence as far as is consistent with obtaining a fair crop which
   will repay labor and expense. This is, so to speak, the ideal theory of
   vine culture; but in practice we must be content with something short
   of the perfect realization of our theory. We cannot, for example,
   rigorously insist that all the fruit shall be such as can endure. Many
   fruits of Christian labor are only transient means towards other fruits
   of a permanent nature; and if we satisfy the law of Christ so far as to
   produce much fruit, some of which shall remain, we do well. The
   permanent portion of a man's work must always be small in proportion to
   the whole. At highest, it can only bear such a proportion to the whole
   as the grape-juice bears to the grapes out of which it is pressed. A
   small cask of wine represents a much larger bulk of grapes; and in like
   manner the perennial result of a Christian life is very inconsiderable
   in volume compared with the mass of thoughts, words, and deeds of which
   that life was made up. One little book, for instance, may preserve to
   all generations the soul and essence of the thoughts of a most gifted
   mind, and of the graces of a noble heart. Witness that wondrous book
   the Pilgrim's Progress, which contains more wine in it than may be
   found in the ponderous folios of some wordy authors, whose works are
   but huge wine-casks with very little wine in them, and sometimes hardly
   even the scent of it.

   To satisfy these two requirements, two virtues are above all needful,
   viz. diligence and patience, -- the one to insure quantity, the other
   to insure superior quality. One must know both how to labor and how to
   wait; never idle, yet never hurrying. Diligence alone will not suffice.
   Bustling activity does a great many things badly, but nothing well. On
   the other hand, patience unaccompanied by diligence degenerates into
   indolence, which brings forth no fruit at all, either good or bad. The
   two virtues must go together; and when they do, they never fail to
   produce, in greater or less abundance, fruit that remaineth in a holy
   exemplary life whose memory is cherished for generations, in an
   apostolic church, in books or in philanthropic institutions, in the
   character of descendants, scholars, or hearers.

   When the two requirements are taken as applying to all believers in
   Christ, the term "much" must be understood relatively. It is not
   required of all indiscriminately to produce an absolutely large
   quantity of fruit, but only of those who, like the apostles, have been
   chosen and endowed to occupy distinguished positions. Of him to whom
   little is given shall little be required. For men of few talents it is
   better not to attempt much, but rather to endeavor to do well the
   little for which they have capacity. Aspiration is good in the
   abstract; but to aspire to exceed the appointed dimensions of our
   career, is to supply a new illustration of the old fable of the frog
   and the ox. The man who would be and do more than he is fit for, is
   worse than useless. He brings forth, not the sweet, wholesome fruits of
   the Spirit, but the inflated fruits of vanity, which, like the apples
   of Sodom, are fair and delicious to the eye and soft to the touch, but
   are yet full of wind, and, being pressed, explode like a puff-ball.
   [553]

   The demand for much fruit, while very exacting as towards the apostles,
   to whom it in the first place refers, has a gracious aspect towards the
   world. The fruit which Jesus expected from His chosen ones was the
   conversion of men to the faith of the gospel -- the ingathering of
   souls into the kingdom of God. A demand for much fruit in this sense is
   an expression of good -- will to mankind, a revelation of the Saviour's
   loving compassion for a world lying in sin, and error, and darkness. In
   making this demand, Jesus says in effect to His apostles: Go into the
   world, bent on evangelizing all the nations; be fruitful and multiply,
   and replenish the earth, and subdue it. Ye cannot bring too many to the
   obedience of faith; the greater the number of those who believe on me
   through your word, the better I shall be pleased. We have here, in
   short, but an echo of the impassioned utterances of that earlier
   occasion, when Jesus welcomed death as the condition of abundant
   fruitfulness, and the cross as a power by whose irresistible attraction
   He should draw all unto Him. [554]

   From the high requirements of the Lord, we pass on to the arguments
   with which He sought to impress on the disciples the duty of bringing
   forth much and abiding fruit. Of these there are no less than six,
   grouped in pairs. The first pair we find indicated in the words:
   "Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and that ye
   may be my disciples." [555] In other words, Jesus would have His chosen
   ones remember that the credit, both of the divine Husbandman, and of
   Himself, the vine, largely depended on their behavior. The world would
   judge by results. If they, the apostles, abounded in fruitfulness, it
   would be remarked that God had not sent Christ into the world in vain;
   and their success would be ascribed to Him whose disciples they had
   been. If they failed, men would say: God planted a vine which has not
   thriven; and the vine produced branches which have borne no fruit; or
   in plain terms, Christ chose agents who have done nothing.

   The force of these arguments for fruitfulness is more obvious in the
   case of these apostles, the founders of the Church, than in reference
   to the present condition of the Church, when the honor of Christ and of
   God the Father seems to depend in a very small measure on the conduct
   of individuals. The whole stress then lay on eleven men. Now it is
   distributed over millions. Nevertheless, there is great need, even yet,
   for spiritually fruitful life in the Church, to uphold the honor of
   Christ's name; for there is a tendency at the present time to look on
   Christianity as used up. The old vine stock is considered by many to be
   effete, and past fruit-bearing; and a new plant of renown is called
   for. This idea can be exploded effectually only in one way, viz. by the
   rising up of a generation of Christians whose life shall demonstrate
   that the "true vine" is not one of the things that wax old and vanish
   away, but possesses eternal vitality, sufficient not only to produce
   new branches and new clusters, but to shake itself clear of dead
   branches, and of all the moss by which it may have become overgrown in
   the course of ages.

   A second pair of motives to fruitfulness we find hinted at in the
   words: "These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain
   in you, and that your joy might be fulfilled." [556] Jesus means to
   say, that the continuance of His joy in the disciples, and the
   completion of their own joy as believers in Him, depended on their
   being fruitful. The emphasis in the first clause lies on the word
   "remain." Jesus has joy in His disciples even now, though spiritually
   crude, even as the gardener hath joy in the clusters of grapes when
   they are green, sour, and uneatable. But He rejoices in them at
   present, not for what they are, but because of the promise that is in
   them of ripe fruit. If that promise were not fulfilled, He should feel
   as the gardener feels when the blossom is nipped by frost, or the green
   fruit destroyed by mildew; or as a parent feels when a son belies in
   his manhood the bright promise of his youth. He can bear delay, but He
   cannot bear failure. He can wait patiently till the process of growth
   has passed through all its stages, and can put up with all the
   unsatisfactory qualities of immaturity, for the sake of what they shall
   ripen into. But if they never ripen, -- if the children never become
   men, if the pupils never become teachers, -- then He will exclaim, in
   bitter disappointment: "Woe is me! my soul desired ripe fruit; and is
   this what I find after waiting so long?"

   In the second clause the stress lies on the word "fulfilled." It is not
   said or insinuated that a Christian can have no joy till his character
   be matured and his work accomplished. The language of Jesus is quite
   compatible with the assertion that even at the very commencement of the
   spiritual life there may be a great, even passionate, outburst of joy.
   But, on the other hand, that language plainly implies that the joy of
   the immature disciple is necessarily precarious, and that the joy which
   is stable and full comes only with spiritual maturity. This is a great
   practical truth, which it concerns all disciples to bear in mind. Joy
   in the highest sense is one of the ripe fruits of the Holy Spirit, the
   reward of perseverance and fidelity. Rejoicing at the outset is good,
   so far as it goes; but all depends on the sequel. If we stop short and
   grow not, woe to us; for failure in all things, and specially in
   religion, is misery. If we be comparatively unfruitful, we may not be
   absolutely unhappy, but we can never know the fulness of joy; for it is
   only to the faithful servant that the words are spoken: "Enter thou
   into the joy of thy Lord." The perfect measure of bliss is for the
   soldier who hath won the victory, for the reaper celebrating harvest,
   home, for the athlete who hath gained the prize of strength, skill, and
   swiftness.

   The two last considerations by which Jesus sought to impress on His
   disciples the duty of being fruitful, were -- the honorable nature of
   their apostolic calling, and the debt of gratitude they owed to Him who
   had called them, and who was now about to die for them. The dignity of
   the apostleship, in contrast to the menial position of the disciple, He
   described in these terms: "Henceforth I call you not servants; for the
   servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends;
   for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto
   you." [557] In other words, the disciples had been apprentices, the
   apostles would be partners: the disciples had been as government
   clerks; the apostles would be confidential ministers of the king: the
   disciples had been pupils in the school of Jesus; the apostles would be
   the treasurers of Christian truth, the reporters and expositors of
   their Master's doctrine, the sole reliable sources of information
   concerning the letter and spirit of His teaching. What office could
   possibly be more important than theirs? and how needful that they
   should realize their responsibilities in connection with it!

   While endeavoring to walk worthy of so high a vocation, it would become
   the apostles also to bear in mind their obligations to Him who had
   called them to the apostolic office. The due consideration of these
   would be an additional stimulus to diligence and fidelity. Hence Jesus
   is careful to impress on His disciples that they owe all they are and
   will be to Him. "Ye did not choose me, but I chose you," [558] He tells
   them. He wishes them to understand that they had conferred no benefit
   on Him by becoming His disciples: the benefit was all on their side. He
   had raised them from obscurity to be the lights of the world, to be the
   present companions and future friends and representatives of the
   Christ. Having done so much for them, He was entitled to ask that they
   would earnestly endeavor to realize the end for which He had chosen
   them, and to fulfil the ministry to which they were ordained.

   One thing more is noteworthy in this discourse on the true vine, -- the
   reiteration of the commandment to love one another. At the commencement
   of the farewell address, Jesus enjoined on the disciples brotherly love
   as a source of consolation under bereavement; here He re-enjoins it
   once and again as a condition of fruitfulness. [559] Though He does not
   say it in so many words, He evidently means the disciples to understand
   that abiding in each other by love is just as necessary to their
   success as their common abiding in Him by faith. Division, party
   strife, jealousy, will be simply fatal to their influence, and to the
   cause they represent. They must be such fast friends that they will
   even be willing to die for each other. Had Christians always remembered
   the commandment of love, on which Christ so earnestly insisted, what a
   different history the Church would have had! how much more fruitful she
   would have been in all the great results for which she was instituted!

   Christ, and represents it as breaking the thread and having little
   bearing on the object of the discourse, which is to comfort the
   disciples in the prospect of their Lord's departure. That was certainly
   one object, but not the only one. The allegory is very apt to the other

  SECTION II. APOSTOLIC TRIBULATIONS AND ENCOURAGEMENTS

    John xv. 18-27, xvi. 1-15.

   From apostolic duties Jesus passed on to speak of apostolic
   tribulations. The transition was natural; for all great actors in God's
   cause, whose fruit remains, are sure to be more or less men of sorrow.
   To be hated and evil entreated is one of the penalties of moral
   greatness and spiritual power; or, to put it differently, one of the
   privileges Christ confers on His "friends."

   Hatred is very hard to bear, and the desire to escape it is one main
   cause of unfaithfulness and unfruitfulness. Good men shape their
   conduct so as to keep out of trouble, and through excess of cowardly
   prudence degenerate into spiritual nonentities. It was of the first
   importance that the apostles of the Christian faith should not become
   impotent through this cause. For this reason Jesus introduces the
   subject of tribulation here. He would fortify His disciples for the
   endurance of sufferings by speaking of them beforehand. "These things,"
   saith He, in the course of His address on the unpleasant theme, as if
   apologizing for its introduction, "have I spoken unto you that ye
   should not be scandalized," [560] that is, be taken by surprise when
   the time of trouble came.

   To nerve the young soldiers of the cross, the Captain of salvation has
   recourse to various expedients, among which the first is to tell them,
   without disguise, what they have to expect, that familiarity with the
   dark prospect may make it less terrible. Of the world's hatred Jesus
   speaks as an absolutely certain matter, not even deeming it necessary
   to assert its certainty, but assuming that as a thing of course: "If
   the world hate you" [561] -- as of course it will. Farther on He
   describes, without euphemism or circumlocution, the kind of treatment
   they shall receive at the world's hands: "They shall put you out of the
   synagogues; yea, but the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will
   think that he offereth service unto God." [562] Harsh, appalling words;
   but since such things were to be, it was well to know the worst.

   Jesus further tells His disciples that whatever they may have to
   suffer, they can be no worse off than He has been before them. "If the
   world hate you, ye know that it has hated me before you." Poor comfort,
   one is disposed to say; yet it is not so poor when you consider the
   relative position of the parties. He who has already been hated is the
   Lord; they who are to be hated are but the servants. Of this Jesus
   reminds His disciples, repeating and recalling to their remembrance a
   word He had already spoken the same evening. [563] The consideration
   ought at least to repress murmuring; and, duly laid to heart, it might
   even become a source of heroic inspiration. The servant should be
   ashamed to complain of a lot from which his Master is not, and does not
   wish to be, exempted; he should be proud to be a companion in
   tribulations with One who is so much his superior, and regard his
   experience of the cross not as a fate, but as a privilege.

   A third expedient employed by Jesus to reconcile the apostles to the
   world's hatred, is to represent it as a necessary accompaniment of
   their election. [564] This thought, well weighed, has great force. Love
   ordinarily rests on a community of interest. Men love those who hold
   the same opinions, occupy the same position, follow the same fashions,
   pursue the same ends with themselves; and they regard all who differ
   from them in these respects with indifference, dislike, or positive
   animosity, according to the degree in which they are made sensible of
   the contrast. Hence arises a dilemma for the chosen ones. Either they
   must forfeit the honor, privileges, and hope of their election, and
   descend into the dark world which is without God and without hope; or
   they must be content, while retaining their position as called out of
   darkness, to accept the drawbacks which adhere to it, and to be hated
   by those who love the darkness rather than the light, because their
   life is evil. What true child of light will hesitate in his choice?

   To show the disciples that they have no alternative but to submit
   patiently to their appointed lot as the chosen ones, Jesus enters yet
   more deeply into the philosophy of the world's hatred. He explains that
   what in the first place will be hatred to them, will mean in the second
   place hatred to Himself; and in the last place, and radically,
   ignorance of and hostility to God His Father. [565] In setting forth
   this truth, He takes occasion to make some severe reflections on the
   unbelieving world of Judea, in which He had Himself labored. He puts
   the worst construction on its unbelief; declares it to be utterly
   without excuse; accuses those who have been guilty of it, of hating Him
   without a cause, that is, of hating one whose whole character and
   conduct, words and works, should have won their faith and love; and in
   their hatred of Him He sees revealed a hatred of that very God for
   whose glory they professed to be so zealous.Vers. 22-25.

   How painful is the view here given of the world's enmity to truth and
   its witnesses! One would like to see, in the bitterness with which the
   messengers of truth have been received (not excepting the case of
   Jesus), the result of a pardonable misunderstanding. And without doubt
   this is the origin of not a few religious animosities. There have been
   many sins committed against the Son of man, and those like-minded,
   which were only in a very mitigated degree sins against the Holy Ghost.
   Were it otherwise, alas for us all! For who has not persecuted the Son
   of man or His interest, cherishing ill-feeling and uttering bitter
   words against His members, if not against Him personally, under the
   influence of prejudice; yea, it may be, going the length of inflicting
   material injury on the apostles of unfamiliar, unwelcome truths, in
   obedience to the blind impulses of panic fear or selfish passion?

   If there be few who have not in one way or another persecuted, there
   are perhaps also few of the persecuted who have not taken too sombre
   views of the guilt of their persecutors. Men who suffer for their
   convictions are greatly tempted to regard their opponents as in equal
   measure the opponents of God. The wrongs they endure provoke them to
   think and speak of the wrong-doers as the very children of the devil.
   Then it gives importance to one's cause, and dignity to one's
   sufferings, to conceive of the former as God's, and of the latter as
   endured for God's sake. Finally, broadly to state the question at stake
   as one between God's friends and God's foes, satisfies both the
   intellect and the conscience, -- the former demanding a status
   questionis which is simple and easily understood; the latter, one which
   puts you obviously in the right, and your adversaries obviously in the
   wrong.

   All this shows that much candor, humility, and patience of spirit, is
   needed before one can safely say, "He that hateth me hateth God."
   Nevertheless, it remains true that a man's real attitude towards God is
   revealed by the way in which he treats God's present work and His
   living servants. On this principle Jesus judged His enemies, though He
   cherished no resentment, and was ever ready to make due allowance for
   Ignorance. In spite of His charity, He believed and said that the
   hostility He had encountered sprang from an evil will, and a wicked,
   godless heart. He had in view mainly the leaders of the opposition who
   organized the mob of the ignorant and the prejudiced into a hostile
   army. These men He unhesitatingly denounced as haters of God, truth,
   and righteousness; and He pointed to their treatment of Himself as the
   conclusive evidence of the fact. His appearance and ministry among them
   had stripped off the mask, and shown them in their real character as
   hypocrites, pretending to sanctity, but inwardly full of baseness and
   impiety, who hated genuine goodness, and could not rest till they had
   got it flung out of the world and nailed to a cross. With the history
   and the sayings of Christ before our eyes, we must beware lest we carry
   apologies for unbelief too far.

   Jesus having spoken, as in a brief digression, of His bitter experience
   in the past, very naturally goes on next to express the hope which He
   cherishes of a brighter future. Hitherto He has been despised and
   rejected of men, but He believes it will not always be so. The world,
   Jewish and Gentile, will ere long begin to change its mind, and the
   Crucified One will become an object of faith and reverence. This hope
   He builds on a strong and sure foundation, even the combined testimony
   of the Spirit of truth and of His own apostles. "But," saith He, His
   face brightening as He speaks, "when the Comforter (of whom He had
   spoken to His little ones, and to whom He now alludes as His own
   Comforter not less than theirs) is come, whom I will send unto you from
   the Father, even the Spirit which proceedeth from the Father, He shall
   testify of me." [566] What results the Spirit would bring about by His
   testimony He does not here state. To that point He speaks shortly
   after, on discovering that His hearers have not apprehended His
   meaning, or at least have failed to find in His words any comfort for
   themselves. Meantime He hastens to intimate that the disciples as well
   as the Spirit of truth will have a share in the honorable work of
   redeeming from disgrace their Master's name and character. They also
   should bear witness, as they were well qualified to do, having been
   with Him from the beginning of His ministry, [567] and knowing fully
   His doctrine and manner of life.

   In this future witness-bearing of the Spirit and of the apostles, Jesus
   sought comfort to His own heart under the depressing weight of a gloomy
   retrospect, and the immediate prospect of crucifixion. But not the less
   did He mean the disciples also to seek from the same quarter strength
   to encounter their tribulations. In truth, no considerations could tend
   more effectually to reconcile generous minds to a hard lot, than those
   implied in what Jesus had just said, viz. that the apostles would
   suffer in a cause favored by Heaven, and tending to the honor of Him
   whom they loved more than life. Who would not choose to be on the side
   for which the Divine Spirit fights, even at the risk of receiving
   wounds? Who would not be happy to be reproached and evil-entreated for
   a name which is worthy to be above every name, especially if assured
   that the sufferings endured contributed directly to the exaltation of
   that blessed name to its rightful place of sovereignty? It was just
   such considerations which more than any thing else supported the
   apostles under their great and manifold trials. They learned to say:
   "For Christ's sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as
   sheep for the slaughter. But what does it matter? The Church is
   spreading; believers are multiplying on every side, springing up an
   hundred-fold from the seed of the martyrs' blood; the name of our Lord
   is being magnified. We will gladly suffer, therefore, bearing witness
   to the truth."

   Having premised these observations concerning the aids to endurance,
   Jesus proceeded at length to state distinctly, in words already quoted,
   what the apostles would have to endure. [568] On these words we make
   only one additional remark, viz., that the disciples would learn from
   them not only the nature of their future tribulations, but the quarter
   whence they were to come. The world, against whose hatred their Master
   forewarns them in this part of His discourse, is not the irreligious,
   sceptical, easy-going, gross-living world of paganism. It is the world
   of antichristian Judaism; of synagogue-frequenting men, accustomed to
   distinguish themselves from "the world" as the people of God, very
   zealous after a fashion for God's glory, fanatically in earnest in
   their religious opinions and practices, utterly intolerant of dissent,
   relentlessly excommunicating all who deviated from established belief
   by a hair's-breadth, and deeming their death no murder, but a religious
   service, an acceptable sacrifice to the Almighty. To this Jewish world
   is assigned the honor of representing the entire kosrnos of men
   alienated from God and truth; and if hatred to the good be the central
   characteristic of worldliness, the honor was well earned, for it was
   among the Jews that the power of hating attained its maximum degree of
   intensity. No man could hate like a religious Jew of the apostolic age:
   he was renowned for his diabolic capacity of hating. Even a Roman
   historian, Tacitus, commemorates the "hostile odium" of the Jewish race
   against all mankind; and the experience of the Christian apostles fully
   justified the prominence given to the Jew by Jesus in discoursing on
   the world's hatred. It was to the unbelieving Jews they mainly owed
   their knowledge of what the world's hatred meant. The pagan world
   despised them rather than hated them. The Greek laughed, and the Roman
   passed by in contemptuous indifference, or at most opposed temperately,
   as one who would rather not. But the persevering, implacable, malignant
   hostility of the Jewish religionist! -- it was bloodthirsty, it was
   pitiless, it was worthy of Satan himself. Truly might Jesus say to the
   Jews, with reference thereto, "Ye are of your father the devil, and the
   lusts of your father ye will do."

   What a strange fruit was this wicked spirit of hatred to grow upon the
   goodly vine which God had planted in the holy land! Chosen to be the
   vehicle of blessing to the world, Israel ends by becoming the enemy of
   the world, "contrary to all men," so as to provoke even the humane to
   regard and treat her as a nuisance, whose destruction from the face of
   the earth would be a common cause of congratulation. Behold the result
   of election abused! Peculiar favors minister to pride, instead of
   stirring up the favored ones to devote themselves to their high
   vocation as the benefactors of mankind; and a divine commonwealth is
   turned into a synagogue of Satan, and God's most deadly foes are those
   of His own house. Alas! the same phenomenon has reappeared in the
   Christian Church. The world that is most opposed to Christ, Antichrist
   itself, is to be found not in heathendom, but in Christendom; not among
   the irreligious and the skeptical, but among those who account
   themselves the peculiar people of God.

   The announcement made by Jesus concerning their future tribulations,
   produced, as was to be expected, a great sensation among the disciples.
   The dark prospect revealed by thy momentary lifting of the veil utterly
   appalled them. Consternation appeared in their faces, and sorrow filled
   their hearts. To be forsaken by their Master was bad enough, but to be
   left to such a fate was still worse, they thought. Jesus noticed the
   impression He had produced, and did what He could to remove it, and
   help the poor disciples to recover their composure.

   First, He makes a sort of apology for speaking of such painful matters,
   to this effect: "I would gladly have been silent concerning your coming
   troubles, and I have been silent as long as possible; but I could not
   think of leaving you without letting you know what was before you,
   which accordingly I have done now, as the hour of my departure is at
   hand." [569] The kind feeling which dictated the statement thus
   paraphrased is manifest; but the statement itself appears inconsistent
   with the records of the other Gospels, from which we learn that the
   hardships connected with discipleship in general, and with the
   apostleship in particular, were a frequent subject of remark in the
   intercourse of Jesus with the twelve. The difficulty has been variously
   dealt with by commentators. Some admit the contradiction, and assume
   that such earlier discourses concerning persecutions as are found --
   e.g. in the tenth chapter of Matthew -- are introduced by the
   evangelist out of their chronological order. Others insist on the
   difference between the earlier utterances and the present in respect to
   plainness: representing the former as vague and general, like the early
   illusions made by Jesus to His own death; the latter as particular,
   definite, and unmistakable, like the announcements which Jesus made
   respecting His passion towards the end of His ministry. A third class
   of expositors make the novelty of this discourse on the world's hatred
   lie in the explanation given therein of its cause and origin; [570]
   while a fourth class insist that the grand distinction between this
   discourse and all that went before is to be found in the fact that it
   is a farewell discourse, and therefore one which, owing to the
   situation, made quite a novel impression. [571]

   Where so much difference of opinion prevails, it would be unbecoming to
   dogmatize. Our own opinion, however, is, that the peculiarity of the
   present utterance concerning apostolic tribulations lies in the manner
   or style, rather than in the matter. On former occasions, especially on
   the occasion of the trial mission of the twelve, Jesus had said much
   the same things: He had spoken of scourging in synagogues at least, if
   not of excommunication from them, and had alluded to death by violence
   as at least a possible fate for the apostles of the kingdom. But He had
   said all things in a different way. There He preached concerning
   persecution; here He makes an awfully real announcement. There is all
   the difference between that discourse and the present communication
   that there would be between a sermon on the text, "It is appointed unto
   men once to die," and a special intimation to an individual, "This year
   thou shalt die." The sermon may say far more about death than the
   intimation, but in how different a manner, and with what a different
   effect!

   The next expedient for curing grief to which Jesus has recourse is
   friendly remonstrance. He gently taunts the disciples for their
   silence, which He regards as a token of hopeless, despairing sorrow.
   "But now I go my way to Him that sent me; and none of you asketh me,
   Whither goest Thou? But because I have said these things unto you,
   sorrow hath filled your heart." [572] "Why," He means to say, "are you
   so utterly cast down? have you no questions to ask me about my
   departure? You were full of questions at the first. You were curious to
   know whither I was going. I would be thankful to have that question
   asked over again, or indeed to have any question put to me, whether
   wise or foolish. The most childish interrogations would be better than
   the gloom of speechless despair."

   As the question, "Whither guest Thou?" had been sufficiently answered
   already, it might have been superfluous to ask it again. There were,
   however, other questions, neither superfluous nor impertinent, which
   the disciples might have taken occasion to ask from the communication
   just made to them concerning their future lot, and which they probably
   would have asked had they not been so depressed in spirit. "If," they
   might have said, "it is to fare so ill with us after you go, why do not
   you stay? While you have been with us you have sheltered us from the
   world's hatred, and you tell us that when you, our leader and head, are
   gone, that hatred will be directed against us, your followers. If so,
   how can we possibly regard your departure as any thing but a calamity?"

   These unspoken questions Jesus proceeds in the next place to answer. He
   boldly asserts that whatever they may think, it is for their good that
   He should go away. [573] The assertion, true in other respects also, is
   made with special reference to the work of the apostleship. In the
   early part of His farewell address, Jesus had explained to His
   disciples how His departure would affect them as private persons or
   individual believers. He had assured them that when "the Comforter"
   came, He would make them feel as if their departed Master were returned
   to them again; yea, as if He were more really present to them than ever
   He had been. Here His object is to show the bearing of His departure on
   their work as apostles, and to make them understand that His going away
   would be good for them as public functionaries.

   The proof of this assertion follows; [574] its substance is to this
   effect: "When I leave you and go to my father, [575] two desiderata of
   essential importance for the success of your work as apostles will be
   supplied. Then you will have receptive hearers, and you yourselves will
   be competent to preach. Neither of these desiderata exists for the
   present. The world has rejected me and my words; and you, though
   sincere, are very ignorant, and understand not what I have taught you.
   After my ascension, there will be a great alteration in both respects:
   the world will be more ready to hear the truth, and you will be able to
   declare it intelligently. The change cannot come till then; for it will
   be brought about by the work of the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, and
   He cannot come till I go."

   In the section of His discourse of which we have given the general
   meaning, Jesus sketches in rapid outline, first the Spirit's converting
   work in the world, [576] and then His enlightening work in the minds of
   the apostles. [577] The former He describes in these terms: "When He is
   come, He will convince (produce serious thought and conviction in) the
   world about sin, righteousness, and judgment." Then He explains in what
   special aspects the Spirit will bring these great moral realities
   before men's minds; and here He but expounds what He has already said
   concerning the Spirit's testimony in His own behalf. [578] He tells His
   disciples that the Comforter, witnessing for Himself in the hearts and
   consciences of men, will convince them of sin specially as unbelievers
   in Him; of righteousness in connection with His departure to the
   Father; and of judgment (to come), because the prince of this world is
   judged already (that is, shall have been, when the Comforter commences
   His work).

   The second and third explanatory remarks are enigmatical, and instead
   of throwing light on the subject in hand, seem rather to involve it in
   darkness. They have given rise to so much dispute and diversity of
   opinion, that to expatiate on them were vain, and to dogmatize
   presumption. One great point of dispute has been: What righteousness
   does Jesus allude to, -- His own, or that of sinners? Does He mean to
   say that the Spirit will convince the world, after He has left the
   earth, that He was a righteous man? or does He mean that the Spirit
   will teach men to see in the Crucified One the Lord their
   righteousness? Our own opinion is, that He means neither, and both.
   Righteousness is to be taken in its undefined generality: and the idea
   is, that the Spirit will make use of the exaltation of Christ to make
   men think earnestly on the whole subject of righteousness; to show them
   the utterly rotten character of their own righteousness, whose crowning
   feat was to crucify Jesus; to bring home to their hearts the solemn
   truth that the Crucified One was the Just One; and ultimately to put
   them on a track for finding in Jesus their true righteousness, by
   raising in their minds the question, Why then did the Just One suffer?

   The meaning of the third explanatory remark we take to be to this
   effect: "When I am crucified, the god of this world shall have been
   judged. Both this world and its god, indeed, but the latter only finely
   and irreversibly, -- the world, though presently following Satan, being
   convertible. When I am ascended, the Spirit will use the then past
   judgment of Satan to convince men of a judgment to come; teaching them
   to see therein a prophecy of a final separation between me and all who
   obstinately persist in unbelief, and so, by the terrors of perdition,
   bringing them to repentance and faith."

   What Jesus says of the enlightening work of the Spirit on the minds of
   the disciples, amounts to this: He will fit you to be intelligent and
   trustworthy witnesses to me, and to be guides of the Church in doctrine
   and practice. For these high purposes two things would be necessary:
   that they should understand Christian truth, and that they should
   possess the gift of prophecy, so as to be able to foretell in its
   general outlines the future, for the warning and encouragement of
   believers. Both these advantages Jesus promises them as fruits of the
   Spirit's enlightening influence. He assures them that, when the
   Comforter is come, He will guide them unto all the truth He had himself
   taught them, recalling things forgotten, explaining things not
   understood, developing germs into a system of doctrine which was
   entirely above their present power of comprehension. [579] He further
   informs them that this same Spirit will show them things to come, --
   such as the rise of heresies and apostasies, the coming of Antichrist,
   the conflict between light and darkness, and their final issue, as
   described in the Book of Revelation.

   Such were the changes to be brought about in the world and in the
   disciples by the advent of the Comforter. Great beneficent changes
   truly; but why cannot they take place before Jesus leaves the world?
   The answer to this question is hinted at by Jesus, when He says of the
   Spirit: "He shall not speak of Himself," [580] and "He shall receive of
   mine, and shall show it unto you." [581] The personal ministry of Jesus
   behoved to come to an end before the ministry of the Spirit began,
   because the latter is merely an application of the former. The Spirit
   does not speak as from Himself: He simply takes of the things relating
   to Christ, and shows them to men, -- to unbelievers, for their
   conviction and conversion; to believers, for their enlightenment and
   sanctification. But till Jesus had died, risen, ascended, the
   essentials about Him would remain incomplete; the materials for a
   gospel would not be ready to hand. There could be neither apostolic
   preaching, nor the demonstration of the Spirit with power accompanying
   it. It must be possible for the apostles and the Spirit to bear witness
   of One who, though perfectly holy, had been crucified, to show the
   world the heinousness of its sin. They must have it in their power to
   declare that God hath made that same Jesus whom they have crucified
   both Lord and Christ, exalted to heavenly glory, before their hearers
   can be pricked in the heart, and made to exclaim in terror, "Men and
   brethren, what shall we do?" Only after Jesus had ascended to glory,
   and become invisible to mortal eyes, [582] could men be made to
   understand that He was not only personally a righteous man, but the
   Lord their righteousness. Then the question would force itself upon
   their mindes: What could be the meaning of the Lord of glory becoming
   man, and dying on the cross? and by the teaching of the Spirit they
   would learn to reply, not as in the days of their ignorance, "He
   suffers for His own offences," but, "Surely He hath borne our griefs
   and carried our sorrows; He was wounded for our transgressions."

   Finally, not till the apostles were in a position to say that their
   Lord was gone to heaven, could they bring to bear with full effect on
   the impenitent the doctrine of a judgment. Then they could say, Christ
   is seated on the heavenly throne a Prince and a Saviour to all who
   believe, but also a Judge to those who continue in rebellion and
   unbelief. "Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and ye perish from the way,
   when His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put
   their trust in Him."

   All this the disciples for the present did not understand. Of the
   Spirit's work on the conscience of the world and in their own minds,
   and of the relation in which the third person of the Trinity [583]
   stood to the second, they had simply no conception. Hence Jesus does
   not enlarge on these topics, but restricts Himself to what is barely
   necessary to indicate the truth. But the time came when the disciples
   did get to understand these matters, and then they fully appreciated
   the eulogium of their Lord on the dispensation of the Comforter. Then
   they acknowledged that the assertion was indeed true that it was
   expedient for them that He should go away, and smiled when they
   remembered that they had once thought otherwise; yea, they perceived
   that the word "expedient," far from being too strong, was rather a weak
   expression, chosen in gracious accommodation to their feeble spiritual
   capacity, instead of the stronger one "indispensable." Then they felt,
   as we imagine good men feel about death when they have got to heaven.
   On this side the grave


   "Timorous mortals start and shrink

   To cross the narrows sea;

   And linger, shivering, on the brink,

   And fear to launch away."

   But to those on the other side how insignificant a matter must death
   seem, and how strange must it appear to their purged vision, that it
   should ever have been needful to prove to them that it was better to
   depart to heaven than to remain in a world of sin and sorrow!

  SECTION III. THE LITTLE WHILE, AND THE END OF THE DISCOURSE

    John xvi. 16-33.

   The eulogium on the dispensation of the Comforter winds up with a
   paradox. Jesus has been telling His disciples that His departure will
   be beneficial for them in various respects, but particularly in this,
   that they shall attain thereafter to a clear, full comprehension of
   Christian truth. In effect, what He has said is: It is good for you
   that I go, for not till I become invisible physically, shall I be
   visible to you spiritually: I must be withdrawn from the eye of your
   flesh, before I can be seen by the eye of your mind. Hence He fitly
   ends His discourse on the Comforter by repeating a riddle, which He had
   propounded in a less pointed form in His first farewell address: "A
   little while, and ye no longer see me: and again a little while, and ye
   shall see me; because I go to the Father."

   This riddle, like all riddles, is very simple when we have the key to
   it. As in that other paradoxical saying of Jesus, concerning losing and
   saving life, [584] the principal word, "see," is used in two senses,
   [585] -- first in a physical, and then, in the second clause, in a
   spiritual sense. Hence the possibility of one event, the departure of
   Christ to the Father, becoming a cause at once of not seeing and of
   seeing. When Jesus ascended to heaven, the disciples saw Him no more as
   they saw Him then in the supper-chamber. But immediately thereafter
   they began to see Him in another way. The idea of His life did sweetly
   creep into the eye and prospect of their soul. And the sight was
   satisfying: it justified the glowing language in which their Master had
   spoken of it before He left them. Though they saw Him no more in the
   flesh, yet, believing in Him, to quote the words of the Apostle Peter,
   they rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory.

   For the present, however, the disciples have no conception of the
   vision and the joy which await them. Their Lord's words have no meaning
   for them; they are a riddle indeed, yea, a contradiction. Standing
   around the inspired speaker, they whisper remarks to each other
   concerning the strange enigmatical words He has just uttered about a
   little while, and about seeing and not seeing, and about going to the
   Father. The riddle has evidently served one purpose at least: it has
   roused the disciples out of the stupor of grief, and awakened for a
   little their curiosity. That, however, is the amount of the service it
   has rendered: it has created surprise, but it has conveyed no sense;
   the hearers are constrained to confess, "We cannot tell what He saith."
   [586] Yet we observe, they ask no questions of Jesus. They would like
   to do so at this point, but they do not feel able to take the liberty;
   restrained, we imagine, by respect for the lofty sustained tone in
   which their Master has been addressing them in the second part of His
   farewell discourse. Jesus, however, reads a question in their
   countenances, and kindly favors them with a word of explanation. [587]

   That word does not, strictly speaking, explain the riddle. Jesus does
   not tell His disciples what the little while means, nor does He
   distinguish the two kinds of seeing: He leaves the enigma to be solved,
   as it only can be, by experience. All He attempts is to make it
   conceivable how the same event which in immediate prospect causes
   sorrow, may, after its occurrence, be a cause of joy. For this purpose
   He compares the crisis through which the disciples are about to pass,
   not, as we have already done, to the solemn event by which a Christian
   makes his exit out of this world into a better, but to the event with
   which human life begins. [588]

   The comparison is apt to the purpose for which it is introduced; but we
   cannot with certainty, not to say propriety, pursue it into detail.
   Interpreters who aspire to understand all mysteries and all knowledge,
   have raised many questions thereanent, such as: Who is represented by
   the mother in the parable -- Christ, or the disciples? When does the
   sorrow begin, and when and in what does it end? The answers given to
   these questions are very various. According to one, Jesus Himself is
   the new man, and the sorrow He alludes to is His own death, viewed as
   the redemption of sinful humanity. Another will have it that Jesus
   represents His own disciples as with child of a spiritual Christ, who
   will be born when the Comforter comes. Most make the time of sorrow
   begin with Christ's passion, but there is much difference of opinion as
   to when it ends. One makes the joy date from the resurrection, which,
   after a little while of painful separation, restored Jesus to His
   sorrowing disciples; another extends the "little while" to Pentecost,
   when the Church was born into the world a new man in Christ; a third
   makes the little while a long while indeed, by making the words "I will
   see you again" refer to Christ's second coming, and to the blessed era
   when the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness,
   for which the whole creation groans, shall at length come into being.
   [589]

   We do not think it necessary to pronounce on these disputed points. As
   little do we think it necessary to give the analogy a doctrinal turn,
   and find in it a reference to regeneration. What Jesus has in view
   throughout this part of His discourse is not the new birth, either of
   the disciples or of the Church, but the spiritual illumination of the
   apostles; their transition from the chrysalis into the winged state,
   from an ignorant implicit faith to a faith developed and intelligent;
   their initiation into the highest grade of the Christian mysteries,
   when they should see clearly things presently unintelligible, and be
   Epopts in the kingdom of heaven. [590] For them, as for Christians
   generally (for there is a sense in which the experience of the apostles
   repeats itself in the spiritual history of many believers), this crisis
   is not less important than the initial one by which men pass from death
   into life. It is a great thing to be regenerated, but it is a not less
   great thing to be illuminated. It is a great, ever-memorable time that,
   when Christ first enters the heart, an object of faith and love; but it
   is an equally important crisis when Christ, after having departed
   perhaps for a season, leaving the mind clouded with doubt and the heart
   oppressed with sorrow, returns never to depart, driving away wintry
   frosts and darkness, and bringing light, gladness, summer warmth, and
   spiritual fruitfulness to the soul. Verily one might be content that
   Christ, as he first knew Him, should depart, for the sake of having his
   sorrow after a little while turned into such joy!

   Having shown, by a familiar and pathetic analogy, the possibility of
   present sorrow being transmuted into great joy, Jesus proceeds next to
   describe, by a few rapid strokes, the characteristics of the state at
   which the apostles will ere long arrive. [591] First among these He
   mentions an enlarged comprehension of truth; for it is to this He
   refers when He says, "In that day ye shall ask me nothing." He means
   that they will then ask Him no questions such as they had been asking
   all along, and especially that night, -- child's questions, asked with
   a child's curiosity, and also with a child's incapacity to understand
   the answers. The questioning spirit of childhood would be replaced by
   the understanding spirit of manhood. The truths of the kingdom would no
   longer, as heretofore, be inscrutable mysteries to them: they should
   have an unction from the Holy One, and should know all things.

   Some think this too much to be said of any Christian, not even
   excepting the apostles themselves, while in the earthly state, and
   therefore argue that the day alluded to here is that of Christ's second
   coming, or of His happy reunion with His own in the kingdom of His
   Father. [592] And without doubt it is true that in that final day only
   shall Christians know as they are known, and have absolutely no need to
   ask any questions. Then,


   " 'Midst power that knows no limit,

   And wisdom free from bound,

   The beatific vision

   Shall glad the saints around,"

   as it can never gladden them here below. Still, the statement before us
   has a relative truth in reference to this present life. While, in
   comparison with the perfect state, the clearest vision of any Christian
   is but a seeing in a glass darkly, the degree of illumination attained
   by the apostles might be described, without exaggeration, in contrast
   to their ignorance as disciples, as that of men who needed not any
   longer to ask questions. In promising His disciples that they would ere
   long attain this high degree, Jesus was but saying in effect, that as
   apostles they would be teachers, not scholars, -- doctors of divinity,
   with titles conferred by Heaven itself, -- capable of answering
   questions of young disciples, similar to those which they once asked
   themselves.

   The second feature of the apostolic illumination mentioned by Jesus is
   unlimited influence with God through prayer. Of this He speaks with
   much emphasis: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask
   the Father in my name, He will give it you." [593] That is to say, the
   apostles were to have at command the whole power of God: the power of
   miracles, to heal diseases; of prophecy, to foretell things to come
   bearing on the Church's interest, and which it was desirable that
   believers should know; of providence, to make all events subservient to
   their well-being, and that of the cause in which they labored. The
   promise in its substance, though not in its miraculous accidents, is
   made to all who aspire to Christian manhood, and is fulfilled to all
   who reach it.

   In the next sentence, Jesus, if we mistake not, particularizes a third
   feature in the state of spiritual maturity to which He would have His
   disciples aspire. It is a heart enlarged to desire, ask, and expect
   great things for themselves, the Church, and the world. "Hitherto," He
   says to them, "have ye asked nothing in my name." There was a reason
   for this, distinct from the spiritual state of the twelve. The time had
   not yet come for asking any thing in Christ's name: they could not
   fitly or naturally make "Christ's sake" their plea till Christ's work
   was completed, and He was glorified. But Jesus meant more than this by
   His remark. He meant to say, what was in fact most true, that hitherto
   His disciples had asked little in any name. Their desires had been
   petty, their ideas of what to ask obscure and crude; any wishes of
   large dimensions they had cherished had been of a worldly character,
   and therefore such as God could not grant. They had been like children,
   to whom a penny appears greater than a thousand pounds does to a
   wealthy man. But Jesus hints, though He does not plainly say, that it
   will be otherwise with the apostles after the advent of the Comforter.
   Then they will be poor boys grown to rich merchants, whose ideas of
   enjoyment have enlarged with their outward fortunes. Then they will be
   able to pray such prayers as that of Paul in his Roman prison in behalf
   of the Ephesian Church, and of the Church in all ages; able to pray the
   Lord's prayer, and especially to say, "Thy kingdom come," with a
   comprehensiveness of meaning, a fervency of desire, and an assurance of
   faith, whereof at present they have simply no conception. Hitherto they
   have been but as children, asking of their father trifles, toys, pence:
   then they shall make large demands on the riches of God's grace, for
   themselves, the Church, and the world.

   Along with this enlargement, Jesus promises, will come fullness of joy.
   What is asked, the Father will grant; and the answer to prayer will
   fill the cup of joy to the brim. Hope may be deferred for a season, but
   in the end will come the unspeakable joy of hope fulfilled. "Ask, and
   ye shall receive, that your joy may be full." So it turned out in the
   experience of the apostles. They had fulness of joy in the Holy Ghost,
   in His work in their own hearts and in the world. The law ought to hold
   good still. But why, then, is the cause of Christianity not
   progressing, but rather, one might almost say, retrograding? We must
   answer this question by asking others: How many have large hearts
   cherishing comprehensive desires? How many with their whole soul desire
   for themselves above all things sanctification and illumination? How
   many earnestly, passionately desire the conversion of the heathen, the
   unity and peace and purity of the Church, the prevalence of
   righteousness in society at large? We are straitened in our own hearts,
   not in God.

   The farewell discourse is now at an end. Jesus has said to His
   disciples what time permits, and what they are able to hear. He does
   not imagine that He has conveyed much instruction to their minds, or
   that He has done much for them in the way of consolation. He has a very
   humble idea of the character and practical effect of the address He has
   just delivered. Casting a glance backwards at the whole, while perhaps
   specially alluding to what had been said just before, He remarks:
   "These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs." A few parables or
   figurative sayings about the house of many mansions, and about the
   Divine Trinity coming to make their abode with the faithful, and about
   the vine and its branches, and about maternal sorrows and joys: such,
   in the speaker's view, is the sum of His discourse.

   Conscious of the inevitable deficiency not only of the present
   discourse, but of His whole past teaching, Jesus takes occasion for the
   third time to repeat the promise of future spiritual illumination, this
   time speaking of Himself as the illuminator, and representing the
   doctrine of the Father as the great subject of illumination. "The time
   cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall
   show you plainly of the Father." The time referred to is still the era
   dating from the ascension. Shortly thereafter the disciples would begin
   to experience the fulfilment of Philip's prayer, to understand what
   their Lord meant by His going to the Father, and to realize its blessed
   consequences for themselves. Then would their exalted Lord, through the
   Spirit of truth, speak to them plainly of these and all other matters;
   plainly in comparison with His present mystic, hidden style of speech,
   if not so plainly as to falsify the statements in other places of
   Scripture concerning the partiality and dimness of all spiritual
   knowledge in this earthly state of being.

   Of the good time coming Jesus has yet another thing to say; not a new
   thing, but an old thing said in a new, wondrously kind, and pathetic
   way. It has reference to the hearing of prayer, and is to this effect:
   "In the day of your enlightenment you will, as I have already hinted,
   pray not less than heretofore, but far more, and you will use my name
   as your plea to be heard. Let me once more assure you that you shall be
   heard. In support of this assurance, I might remind you that I will be
   in heaven with the Father, ever ready to speak a word in your behalf,
   saying, Father, hear them for my sake, whose name they plead in their
   petitions.' But I do not insist on this, not only because I believe you
   do not need to be assured of my continued interest in your welfare, but
   more especially because my intercession will not be necessary. My
   Father will not need to be entreated to hear you, the men who have been
   with me in all my temptations, [594] who have loved me with
   leal-hearted affection, who have believed in me as the Christ, the Son
   of the living God, while the world at large has regarded me as an
   impostor and a blasphemer. For these services to His Son my Father
   loves you, is grateful to you -- in a sense accounts Himself your
   debtor." [595] What heart, what humanity, what poetry is in all this!
   -- poetry, and also truth; truth unspeakably comforting not only to the
   eleven faithful companions of Jesus, but to all sincere believers in
   Him.

   Having alluded to the faith of His disciples, -- so meritorious,
   because so rare, -- Jesus takes occasion, in closing His discourse, and
   at the close of His life, solemnly to declare its truth. "I came forth
   from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world,
   and go to the Father." [596] The first part only of this statement the
   disciples believed; the second they did not yet understand: but Jesus
   puts both together, as the two halves of one whole truth, either of
   which necessarily implies the other. The declaration is a most
   momentous one: it sums up the history of Christ; it is the substance of
   the Christian faith; it asserts doctrines utterly incompatible with a
   merely human view of Christ's person, and makes His divinity the
   fundamental article of the creed.

   These last words of Jesus burst on the disciples like a star suddenly
   shining out from the clouds in a dark night. At length one luminous
   utterance had pierced through the haze of their Master's mysterious
   discourse, and they fancied that now at last they understood its
   import. Jesus had just told them that He came forth from the Father
   into the world. That, at least, they understood; it was because they
   believed it that they had become disciples. Delighted to have heard
   something to which they could give a hearty response, they make the
   most of it, and inform their Master that the intelligible, plain
   speaking on His part, and the intelligent apprehending on theirs which
   He had projected into the future, were already in existence. "Lo," said
   they, with emphasis on the temporal particle, "now Thou speakest
   plainly, and speakest no proverb. Now are we sure that Thou knowest all
   things, and needest not that any man should ask Thee: in this we
   believe that Thou camest forth from God."

   Alas, how impossible it is for children to speak otherwise than as
   children! The disciples, in the very act of professing their knowledge,
   betray their utter ignorance. The statement beginning with the second
   "now" indicates an almost ludicrous misapprehension of what Jesus had
   said about their asking Him no questions in the day of their
   enlightenment. He meant they would not then need to ask questions as
   learners: they took Him to mean that He Himself had no need to be asked
   questions as to who He was and whence He came, His claim to a heavenly
   descent being already admitted, at least by them. And as to the
   inference drawn from that statement, "By this we believe," we can make
   nothing of it. After many attempts to understand the logic of the
   disciples, we must confess ourselves utterly baffled. The only way by
   which we can put a tolerable sense on the words, is to regard the
   phrase translated by "this" as an adverb of time, and to read "at this
   present moment: "Meanwhile, whatever additional light may be in store
   for us in the future, we even now believe that Thou camest forth from
   God. This translation, however, is not favored, or even suggested, by
   any of the critics. [597]

   That the disciples did honestly believe what they professed to believe,
   was true. Jesus had just before admitted as much. But they did not
   understand what was involved in their belief. They did not comprehend
   that the coming of Jesus from the Father implied a going thither again.
   They had not comprehended that at the beginning of the discourse; they
   did not comprehend it when the discourse was finished; they would not
   comprehend it till their Lord had taken His departure, and the Spirit
   had come who should make all things plain. In consequence of this
   ignorance, their faith would not carry them through the evil hour that
   was now very near. The death of their Master, the first step in the
   process of His departure, would take them by surprise, and make them
   flee panic-stricken like sheep attacked by wolves. So Jesus plainly
   told them. "Do ye now believe?" He said; "behold, the hour cometh, yea,
   is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and
   shall leave me alone." [598]

   Stern fact sternly announced; but however stern, Jesus is not afraid to
   look it in the face. His heart is in perfect peace, for He has two
   great consolations. He has a good conscience: He can say, "I have
   overcome the world." He has held fast His moral integrity against
   incessant temptation. The prince of this world has found none of his
   spirit in Him, and for that very reason is going to crucify Him. But by
   that proceeding Satan will not nullify, but rather seal, His victory.
   Outward defeat by worldly power will be but the index and measure of
   His spiritual conquest. The world itself knows well that putting Him to
   death is but the second best way of overcoming Him. His enemies would
   have been much better pleased if they had succeeded in intimidating or
   bribing Him into compromise. The ungodly powers of the world always
   prefer corruption to persecution as a means of getting rid of truth and
   righteousness; only after failing in attempts to debauch conscience,
   and make men venal, do they have recourse to violence.

   Christ's other source of consolation in prospect of death is the
   approval of His Father: "I am not alone, because the Father is with
   me." The Father has been with Him all along. On three critical
   occasions -- at the baptism, on the hill of transfiguration, in the
   temple a few days ago -- the Father had encouraged Him with an
   approving voice. He feels that the Father is with Him still. He expects
   that He will be with Him when He is deserted by His chosen ones, and
   all through the awful crisis at hand, even in that darkest, bitterest
   moment, when the loss of His Father's sensible presence will extort
   from Him the cry: "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" He
   expects that His Father will be with Him then, not to save Him from the
   sense of desertion (He would not wish to be saved from that, for He
   would know by experience that sorest of all sorrows, that in this, as
   in all other respects, He might be like His brethren, and be able to
   succor them when they are tempted to despair), but to sustain Him under
   the sore affliction, and enable Him with filial faith to cry "My God"
   even when complaining of being forsaken.

   Free from all anxiety for Himself, Jesus bids His disciples also be of
   good cheer; and for the same reason why He Himself is without fear,
   viz., because He has overcome the world. He will have them understand
   that His victory is theirs too. "Be of good cheer: I have overcome the
   world, therefore so have ye in effect;." -- such is His meaning. Men of
   Socinianizing tendencies would interpret the words differently. They
   would read: I have overcome the world, therefore so may ye. Follow my
   example, and manfully fight the battle of righteousness in spite of
   tribulations. [599] The meaning is good enough, so far as it goes. It
   does nerve one for the battle of life to know that the Lord of glory
   has been through it before him. It is an inspiring thought that He has
   even been a combatant at all; for who would not follow when the divine
   Captain of salvation leads through suffering to glory? Then, when we
   think that this august combatant has been completely victorious in the
   fight, His example becomes still more cheering. His victory shows that
   the god of this world is not omnipotent; that it is always in the power
   of any one to overcome him simply by being willing to bear the cross.
   Looking at Jesus enduring the contradiction of sinners even unto death,
   and despising the shame of crucifixion, His followers get more heart to
   fight the good fight of faith.

   But while this is true, it is the smallest part of the truth. The grand
   fact is that Christ's victory is the victory of His followers, and
   insures that they too shall conquer. Jesus fought His battle not as a
   private person, but as a public character, as a representative man. And
   all are welcome to claim the benefits of His victory, -- the pardon of
   sin, power to resist the evil one, admission into the everlasting
   kingdom. Because Christ hath overcome, we may say to all, Be of good
   cheer. The victory of the Son of God in human nature is an available
   source of consolation for all who partake of that nature. It is the
   privilege of every man (as well as the duty) to acknowledge Christ as
   his representative in this great battle. "The Head of every man is
   Christ." All who sincerely recognize the relationship will get the
   benefit of it. Claim kindred with the High Priest, and you shall
   receive from Him mercy and grace to help in your hour of need. Lay it
   to heart that men are not isolated units, every one fighting his own
   battle without help or encouragement. We are members one of another,
   and above all, we have in Christ an elder brother. We have at least a
   human relationship to Him, if not a regenerate one. Let us therefore
   look up to Him as our Head in all things: as our King, and lay down the
   weapons of our rebellion; as our Priest, and receive from Him the
   pardon of our sins; as our Lord, to be ruled by His will, defended by
   His might, and guided by His grace. If we do this, the accuser of the
   brethren will have no chance of prevailing against us. The words of St.
   John in the Apocalypse will be fulfilled in our history: "They overcame
   him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and
   they loved not their lives unto the death."

26. THE INTERCESSORY PRAYER

    John 17.

   The prayer uttered by Jesus at the close of His farewell address to His
   disciples, of unparalleled sublimity, whether we regard its contents or
   the circumstances amid which it was offered up, it was for years our
   fixed purpose to pass over in solemn, reverent silence, without note or
   comment. We reluctantly depart from our intention now, constrained by
   the considerations that the prayer was not offered up mentally by
   Jesus, but in the hearing and for the instruction of the eleven men
   present; that it has been recorded by one of them for the benefit of
   the Church in all ages; and that what it hath pleased God to preserve
   for our use we must endeavor to understand, and may attempt to
   interpret.

   The prayer falls naturally into three divisions, in the first of which
   Jesus prays for Himself, in the second for His disciples, and in the
   third for the Church which was to be brought into existence by their
   preaching.

   The prayer of Jesus for Himself (vers. 1-5.) contains just one
   petition, with two reasons annexed. The petition is, "Father, the hour
   is come, glorify Thy Son;." in which the manner of address, simple,
   familiar, confidential, is noteworthy. "Father!" -- such is the first
   word of the prayer, six times repeated in its course, with or without
   epithet attached, and the name which Jesus gives to Him to whom His
   prayer is addressed. He speaks to God as if He were already in heaven,
   as indeed He expressly says He is a little farther on: "Now I am no
   more in the world."

   The significant phrase, "the hour is come," is it not less worthy of
   notice. How much it expresses! -- filial obedience, filial intimacy,
   filial hope and joy. The hour! It is the hour for which He has
   patiently waited, which He has looked forward to with eager
   expectation, yet has never sought to hurry on; the hour appointed by
   His Father, about which Father and Son have always had an
   understanding, and of which none but they have had any knowledge. That
   hour is come, and its arrival is intimated as a plea in support of the
   petition: "Thou knowest, Father, how patiently I have waited for what I
   now ask, not wearying in well-doing, nor shrinking from the hardships
   of my earthly lot. Now that my work is finished, grant me the desire of
   my heart, and glorify me."

   "Glorify me," that is, "take me to be with Thyself." The prayer of
   Jesus is that His Father would be pleased now to translate Him from
   this world of sin and sorrow into the state of glory He left behind
   when He became man. Thus He explains His own meaning when He repeats
   His request in a more expanded form, as given in the fifth verse: "And
   now, O Father, glorify Thou me with Thine own self, with the glory I
   had with Thee before the world was," i. e. with the glory He enjoyed in
   the bosom of the Father before His incarnation as God's eternal Son.

   It is observable that in this prayer for Himself Jesus makes no
   allusion to His approaching sufferings. Very shortly after, in
   Gethsemane, He prayed: "O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup
   pass from me!" But here is no mention of the cup of sorrow, but only of
   the crown of glory. For the present heaven is in full view, and its
   anticipated glories make Him oblivious of every thing else. Not till He
   is gone out into the night do the sulphurous clouds begin to gather
   which overshadow the sky and shut out the celestial world from sight.
   Yet the coming passion, though not mentioned, is virtually included in
   the prayer. Jesus knows that He must pass through suffering to glory,
   and that He must behave Himself worthily under the last trial, in order
   to reach the desired goal. Therefore the uttered prayer includes this
   unuttered one: "Carry me well through the approaching struggle; let me
   pass through the dark valley to the realms of light without flinching
   or fear." [600]

   The first reason annexed to the prayer is, "That Thy Son also may
   glorify Thee." Jesus seeks His own glorification merely as a means to a
   higher end, the glorification of God the Father. And in so connecting
   the two glorifyings as means and end, He but repeats to the Father what
   He had said to His disciples in His farewell address. He had told them
   that it was good for them that He should go, as not till His departure
   would any deep impression be made on the world's conscience with
   respect to Himself and His doctrine. He now tells His Father in effect:
   "It is good for Thy glory that I leave the earth and go to heaven; for
   henceforth I can promote Thy glory in the world better there than by a
   prolonged sojourn here." To enforce the reason, Jesus next declares
   that what He desires is to glorify the Father in His office as the
   Saviour of sinners: "As Thou hast given Him power over all flesh, that
   He should give eternal life to as many as Thou hast given Him." [601]
   Interpreted in the light of this sentence, the prayer means: "Thou
   sentest me into the world to save sinners, and hitherto I have been
   constantly occupied in seeking the lost, and communicating eternal life
   to such as would receive it. But the time has come when this work can
   be best carried on by me lifted up. Therefore exalt me to Thy throne,
   that from thence, as a Prince and a Saviour, I may dispense the
   blessings of salvation."

   It is important to notice how Jesus defines His commission as the
   Savior. He represents it at once as concerning all flesh, and as
   specially concerning a select class, thus ascribing to His work a
   general and a particular reference, in accordance with the teaching of
   the whole New Testament, which sets forth Christ at one time as the
   Saviour of all men, at another as the Saviour of His people, of the
   elect, of His sheep, of those who believe. This style of speaking
   concerning the redeeming work of our Saviour it is our duty and our
   privilege to imitate, avoiding extremes, both that of denying or
   ignoring the universal aspects of Christ's mission, and that of
   maintaining that He is in the same sense the Saviour of all, or that He
   will and must eventually save all. Both extremes are excluded by the
   carefully selected words of Jesus in His intercessory prayer. On the
   one hand, He speaks of all flesh as belonging to His jurisdiction as
   the Saviour of humanity at large as the mass into which the leaven is
   to be deposited, with a view to leavening the whole lump. On the other
   hand, there is an obvious restriction on the universality of the first
   clause in the terms of the second. The advocates of universal
   restoration have no support for their tenet here. They may indeed ask:
   If Jesus has power over all flesh, is it credible that He will not use
   it to the uttermost? In reply, we shall not seek to evade the question,
   by resolving the power claimed into a mere mediatorial sovereignty over
   the whole solely for the sake of a part, because we know that the elect
   part is chosen not merely for its own sake, but also for the sake of
   the whole, to be the salt of the earth, the light of the world, and the
   leaven to leaven the corrupt mass. [602] We simply observe that the
   power of the Saviour is not compulsory. Men are not saved by force as
   machines, but by love and grace as free beings; and there are many whom
   brooding love would gather under its wings who prefer remaining outside
   to their own destruction.

   The essence of eternal life is defined in the next sentence of the
   prayer, and represented as consisting in the knowledge of the only true
   God, and of Jesus Christ His messenger, knowledge been taken
   comprehensively as including faith, love, and worship, and the emphasis
   lying on the objects of such knowledge. The Christian religion is here
   described in opposition to paganism on the one hand, with its many
   gods, and to Judaism on the other, which, believing in the one true
   God, rejected the claims of Jesus to be the Christ. It is further so
   described as to exclude by anticipation Arian and Socinian views of the
   person of Christ. The names of God and of Jesus are put on a level as
   objects of religious regard, whereby an importance is assigned to the
   latter incompatible with the dogma that Jesus is a mere man. For
   eternal life cannot depend on knowing any man, however wise and good:
   the utmost that can be said of the benefit derivable from such
   knowledge is that it is helpful towards knowing God better, which can
   be affirmed not only of Jesus, but of Moses, Paul, John, and all the
   apostles.

   It may seem strange that, in addressing His Father, Jesus should deem
   it needful to explain wherein eternal life consists; and some, to get
   rid of the difficulty, have supposed that the sentence is an
   explanatory reflection interwoven into the prayer by the evangelist.
   Yet the words were perfectly appropriate in the mouth of Jesus Himself.
   The first clause is a confession by the man Jesus of His own faith in
   God His Father as the supreme object of knowledge; and the whole
   sentence is really an argument in support of the prayer, Glorify Thy
   Son. The force of the declaration lies in what it implies respecting
   the existing ignorance of men concerning the Father and His Son. It is
   as if Jesus said: Father, Thou knowest that eternal life consists in
   knowing Thee and me. Look around, then, and see how few possess such
   knowledge. The heathen world knoweth Thee not -- it worships idols: the
   Jewish world is equally ignorant of Thee in spirit and in truth; for,
   while boasting of knowing Thee, it rejects me. The whole world is
   overspread with a dark veil of ignorance and superstition. Take me out
   of it, therefore, not because I am weary of its sin and darkness, but
   that I may become to it a sun. Hitherto my efforts to illuminate the
   darkness have met with small success. Grant me a position from which I
   can send forth light over all the earth.

   But why does the Saviour here alone, in the whole Gospel history, call
   Himself Jesus Christ? Some see in this compound name, common in the
   apostolic age, another proof that this verse is an interpolation.
   Again, however, without reason, for the style in which Jesus designates
   Himself exactly suits the object He has in view. He is pleading with
   the Father to take Him to glory, that He may the more effectually
   propagate the true religion. What more appropriate in this connection
   than to speak of Himself objectively under the name by which He should
   be known among the professors of the true religion?

   The second reason pleaded by Jesus in support of His prayer, is that
   His appointed service has been faithfully accomplished, and now claims
   its guerdon: "I have glorified Thee on the earth: I have finished the
   work which Thou gavest me to do. Now, therefore, glorify Thou me."
   [603] The great Servant of God speaks here not only with reference to
   the past, but by anticipation with reference to His passion already
   endured in purpose; so that the "I have finished" of the prayer is
   equivalent in meaning to the "It is finished" spoken from the cross.
   And what He says concerning Himself is true; the declaration, though
   one which no other human being could make without abatement, is on His
   part no exaggerated, boastful piece of self-laudation, but the sober,
   humble utterance of a conscience void of offence towards God and
   towards men. Nor can we say that the statement, though true, was
   ultroneous and uncalled for. It was necessary that Jesus should be able
   to make that declaration; and though the fact declared was well known
   to God, it was desirable to proclaim in the hearing of the eleven, and
   unto the whole Church through their record, the grounds on which His
   claim to be rewarded with glory rested, for the strengthening of faith.
   For as our faith and hope towards God are based on the fact that Jesus
   Christ was able to make the declaration in question, so they are
   confirmed by the actual making of it, His protestation that He has kept
   His covenant of work being to us, as it were, a seal of the covenant of
   grace, serving the same end as the sacrament of the Supper.

   Having offered this brief petition for Himself, Jesus proceeded to pray
   for His disciples at much greater length, all that follows having
   reference to them mainly, and from the sixth to the twentieth verse
   6-20] referring to them exclusively. The transition is made by a
   special declaration, applying the general one of the preceding sentence
   to that part of Christ's personal work which consisted in the training
   of these men: "I have manifested Thy name unto the men whom Thou
   gravest me out of the world." [604] After this introductory statement
   follows a short description of the persons about to be prayed for.
   Jesus gives His disciples a good character. First, scrupulously careful
   not to exaggerate the importance of the service He has rendered in
   training them for the apostolate, He acknowledges that they were good
   when He got them: "Thine they were, and Thou gavest them me:." they
   were pious, devout men, God-taught, God-drawn, God-given. Then He
   testifies that since they had been with Him they had sustained the
   character they had when they joined His company: "They have kept Thy
   word." And finally, He bears witness that the men whom His Father had
   given Him had been true believers in Himself, and had received all His
   words as the very truth of God, and Himself as one sent forth into the
   world by God. [605] Here, surely, is a generous eulogy on disciples,
   who, while sincere and devoted to their Master, were, as we know,
   exceedingly faulty in conduct, and slow to learn.

   Having thus generously praised His humble companions, Jesus intimates
   His intention to pray for them: "I pray for them." But the prayer comes
   not just yet; for some prefatory words must be premised, to give the
   prayer more emphasis when it does come. First, the persons prayed for
   are singled out as for the moment the sole objects of a concentrated
   solicitude. "I pray for them: I pray not for the world." [606] The
   design of Jesus in making this statement is not, of course, to intimate
   the absolute exclusion of the world from His sympathies. Not exclusion,
   but concentration in order to eventual inclusion, is His purpose here.
   He would have His Father fix His special regards on this small band of
   men, with whom the fortunes of Christianity are bound up. He prays for
   them as a mother dying might pray exclusively for her children, -- not
   that she is indifferent to the interest of all beyond, but that her
   family, in her solemn situation, is for her the natural legitimate
   object of an absorbing, all-engrossing solicitude. He prays for them as
   the precious fruit of His life-labor, the hope of the future, the
   founders of the Church, the Noah's ark of the Christian faith, the
   missionaries of the truth to the whole world; for them alone, but for
   the world's sake, -- it being the best thing He can do for the world
   meantime to commend them to the Father's care.

   What Jesus means to ask for the men thus singled out, we can now guess
   for ourselves. It is that His Father would keep them, now that He is
   about to leave them. But before the request come two reasons why it
   should be granted. The first is expressed in these terms: "They are
   Thine: and all mine are Thine, and Thine are mine; and I am glorified
   in them;." [607] -- and means in effect this: "It is Thy business, Thy
   interest, to keep these men. They are Thine; Thou gravest them me: keep
   Thine own. Although since they became my disciples they have been mine,
   that makes no difference: they are still Thine; for between me and Thee
   is no distinction of meum and tuum. Then I am glorified in them: my
   cause, my name, my doctrine, are to be henceforth identified with them;
   and if they miscarry, my interest will be shipwrecked. Therefore, as
   Thou values the honor of Thy Son, keep these men." The other reason why
   the request about to be proffered should be granted is: "And now I am
   no more in the world." [608] The Master, about to depart from the
   earth, commends to His Father's care those whom He is leaving behind
   without a head.

   And now at length comes the prayer for the eleven, ushered in with due
   solemnity by a new emphatic address to the Hearer of prayer: "Holy
   Father, keep in Thine own name those whom Thou hast given me, that they
   may be one, as we are." [609] The epithet "holy" suits the purport of
   the prayer, which is that the disciples may be kept pure in faith and
   practice, separate from all existing error and sin, that they may be
   eventually a salt to the corrupt world in which their Lord is about to
   leave them. The prayer itself embraces two particulars. The first is
   that the disciples may be kept in the name of the Father, which Jesus
   has manifested to them; that is, that they may continue to believe what
   He had taught them of God, and so become His instruments for diffusing
   the knowledge of the true God and the true religion throughout the
   earth. The second is, that they may be one, that is, that they may be
   kept in love to each other, as well as in the faith of the divine name;
   separate from the world, but not divided among themselves. [610] These
   two things, truth and love, Jesus asks for His own, as of vital moment:
   truth as the badge of distinction between His Church and the world;
   love as the bond which unites believers of the truth into a holy
   brotherhood of witness-bearers to the truth. These two things the
   Church should ever keep in view as of co-ordinate importance: not
   sacrificing love to truth, dividing those who should be one by
   insisting on too minute and detailed a testimony; nor sacrificing truth
   to love, making the Church a very broad, comprehensive society, but a
   society without a vocation or raison d'Ãªtre, having no truth to guard
   and teach, or testimony to bear.

   Having commended His disciples to His Father's care, Jesus next gives
   an account of His own stewardship as their Master, and protests that He
   has faithfully kept them in divine truth. [611] He claims to have done
   His duty by them all, not even excepting Judas, in whose case He admits
   failure, but at the same time clears Himself of blame. The reference to
   the false disciple shows how conscientious He is in rendering His
   account. He feels, as it were, put on His defense with reference to the
   apostate; and supposing Himself to be asked the question, What have you
   to say about this man? He replies in effect: "I admit I have not been
   able to keep him from falling, but I have done all I could. The son of
   perdition is not lost through my fault." [612] We know how well
   entitled Jesus was to make this protestation.

   In the next part of the prayer [613] Jesus defines the sense in which
   He asks that His disciples may be kept, and in doing this virtually
   offers new reasons why the petition should be heard. He commends them
   to His Father's care as the depositaries of truth, worth keeping on
   that account, and needing to be kept, because of the world's dislike of
   the truth. [614] And He explains that by keeping He means not
   translation out of the world, but preservation in the world from its
   moral evil, their presence there as a salt being necessary, and their
   purity not less needful, that the salt might not be without savor and
   virtue. This explanation He meant not for the ear of His Father alone,
   but also for the ears of His disciples. He wished them to understand
   that two things were equally to be shunned, -- conformity to the world,
   and weariness of the world. They must abide in the truth, and they must
   abide in the world for the truth's sake; mindful, for their
   consolation, that when they felt the world's hatred most, they were
   doing most good, and that the weight of their cross was the measure of
   their influence.

   The keeping asked by Jesus for His own is but the continuance and
   perfecting of an existing moral condition. He needs not to ask His
   Father now for the first time to separate His disciples in spirit and
   character from the world. That they are already; that they were when
   first they joined His society; that they have continued to be. This, in
   justice to them, their Master is careful to state twice over in this
   portion of His prayer. "They," He testifies, "are not of the world,
   even as I am not of the world," [615] putting them on a level with
   Himself with characteristic magnanimity, and not without truth; for the
   persons thus described, though in many respects defective, were very
   unworldly, caring nothing for the world's trinity, -- riches, honors,
   and pleasures, -- but only for the words of eternal life.

   Yet, notwithstanding their sincerity, the eleven still needed not only
   keeping, but perfecting; and therefore their Master went on to pray for
   their sanctification in the truth, having in view not only their
   perseverance, growth, and maturity in grace as private Christians, but
   more especially their spiritual equipment for the office of the
   apostleship. Hence He goes on in the next breath to make mention of
   their apostolic vocation, showing that that is principally in His eye:
   "As Thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them
   into the world." [616] That they may be fitted for their mission is His
   intense desire. Hence He proceeds to speak of His own sanctification as
   a means towards their apostolic sanctification as the end, as if His
   own ministry were merely subordinate to theirs. For their sakes I
   sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth."
   [617] Remarkable words, whose meaning is obscure, and has been much
   debated, but in which we may at least with confidence discover a
   singular display of condescension and love. Jesus speaks here like a
   parent who lives for the sake of His children, having a regard to their
   moral training in all His personal habits, denying Himself pleasures
   for their benefit, and making it His chief end and care to form their
   characters, perfect their education, and fit them for the duties of the
   position which they are destined to fill.

   The remainder of the prayer (with exception of the two closing
   sentences) [618] respects the Church at large, -- those who should
   believe in Christ through the word of the apostles, heard from their
   lips, or reported in their writings. What Jesus desires for the body of
   believers is partly left to be inferred; for when He says, "I pray not
   for these alone," He intimates that He desires for the parties next to
   be prayed for the same things He has already asked for his disciples:
   preservation in the truth, and from the evil in the world, and
   sanctification by the truth. The one blessing He expressly asks for the
   Church is "unity." His heart's desire for believers in Him is "that
   they all may be one." His ideal of the Church's unity is very high, its
   divine exemplar being the unity subsisting between the persons in the
   Godhead, and specially between the Father and the Son, and its ground
   the same divine unity: "one as we are one, and in us who are one,"
   bound together as closely and harmoniously by the common name into
   which they are baptized, and by which they are called. [619]

   This unity, desirable for its own sake, Jesus specially desiderates,
   because of the moral power which it will confer on the Church as an
   institute for propagating the Christian faith: "That the world may
   believe that Thou hast sent me." [620] Now this end is one which cannot
   be promoted unless the unity of believers be in some way made manifest.
   A unity which is not apparent can have no effect on the world, but must
   needs be as a candle under a bushel, which gives no light, nay, ceases
   to be a light, and goes out. There can be no doubt, therefore, that our
   Lord had a visible unity in view; and the only question is how that is
   to be reached. The first and most obvious way is by union in one church
   organization, with appointed means for representing the whole body, and
   expressing its united mind; such, e.g., as the oecumenical councils of
   the early centuries. This, the most complete manifestation of unity,
   was exhibited in the primitive Church.

   In our day incorporating union on a great scale [621] is not possible,
   and other methods of expressing the feeling of catholicity must be
   resorted to. One method that might be tried is that of confederation,
   whereby independent church organizations might be united after the
   fashion of the United States of America, or of the Greek republics,
   which found a centre of unity in the legislative and judicial assembly
   called the Amphictyonic Council. But whatever may be thought of that,
   one thing is certain, that the unity of believers in Christ must be
   made more manifest as an undeniable fact somehow, if the Church is to
   realize her vocation as a holy nation called out of darkness to show
   forth the virtues of Him whose name she bears, and win for Him the
   world's homage and faith. It is true, indeed, that the unity of the
   Church does find expression in its creed; by which we mean not the
   sectional creed of this or that denomination, but the creed within the
   creeds, expressive of the catholic orthodoxy of Christendom, and
   embracing the fundamentals, and only the fundamentals, of the Christian
   faith. There is a Church within all the churches to which this creed is
   the thing of value, all else being, in the esteem of its members, but
   the husk containing the precious kernel. But the existence of that
   Church is a fact known by faith, not by sight: its influence is little
   felt by the world; and however thankful we may be for the presence in
   the midst of ecclesiastical organizations of this holy commonwealth, we
   cannot accept it as the realization of the ideal which the Saviour had
   in His mind when He uttered the words, "That they all may be one."

   In the next two sentences [622] Jesus fondly lingers over this prayer,
   repeating, expanding, enforcing the petition in language too deep for
   our fathoming line, but which plainly conveys the truth that without
   unity the Church can neither glorify Christ, commend Christianity as
   divine, nor have the glory of Christ abiding on herself. And this is a
   truth which, on reflection, approves itself to reason. Wrangling is not
   a divine thing, and it needs no divine influence to bring it about.
   Anybody can quarrel; and the world, knowing that, has little respect
   for a quarrelling Church. But the world opens its eyes in wonder at a
   community in which peace and concord prevail, saying, Here is something
   out of the common course, -- selfishness and self-will rooted out of
   human nature: nothing but a divine influence could thus subdue the
   centrifugal forces which tend to separate men from each other.

   The endearing name Father, with which the next sentence begins, marks
   the commencement of a new final paragraph in the prayer of the great
   High Priest. [623] Jesus at this point casts a glance forward to the
   end of things, and prays for the final consummation of God's purpose
   with regard to the Church: that the Church militant may become the
   Church triumphant; that the body of saints, imperfectly sanctified on
   earth, may become perfectly sanctified and glorified in heaven, with
   Himself where He will be, beholding His glory, and changed into the
   same image by the Spirit of God.

   Then comes the conclusion, in which Jesus returns from the distant
   future to the present, and gathers in His thoughts from the Church at
   large to the company assembled in the supper-chamber, Himself and His
   disciples. [624] These two closing sentences serve the same use in
   Christ's prayer that the phrase "for Christ's sake" serves in ours.
   They contain two pleas, -- the service of the parties prayed for, and
   the righteousness of the Being prayed to, -- the last coming first,
   embodied in the title, "O righteous Father." The services, merits, and
   claims of Jesus and His disciples are specifically mentioned as matters
   to which the righteous Father will doubtless attach the due weight. The
   world's ignorance of God is alluded to, to enhance the value of the
   acknowledgment which He has received from His Son and His Son's
   companions. That ignorance explains why Jesus deems it necessary to
   say, "I have known Thee." Even His knowledge was not a thing of course
   in such a world. It was an effort for the man Jesus to retain God in
   His knowledge, quite as much as to keep Himself unspotted from the
   world's corruptions. It was as hard for Him to know and confess God as
   Father in a world that in a thousand ways practically denied that
   Fatherhood, as to live a life of love amid manifold temptations to
   self-seeking. In truth, the two problems were one. To be light in the
   midst of darkness, love in the midst of selfishness, holiness in the
   midst of depravity, are in effect the same thing.

   While pleading His own merit, Jesus forgets not the claims of His
   disciples. Of them He says in effect: They have known Thee at
   second-hand through me, as I have known Thee at first-hand by direct
   intuition. [625] Not content with this statement, He expatiates on the
   importance of these men as objects of divine care, representing that
   they are worth keeping, as already possessing the knowledge of God's
   name, and destined ere long to know it yet more perfectly, so that they
   shall be able to make it known as an object of homage to others, and
   God shall be able to love them even as He loved His own Son, when He
   was in the world faithfully serving His heavenly Father. "And I have
   declared unto them Thy name, and will declare it; that the love
   wherewith Thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them." [626]
   Wonderful words to be uttered concerning mere earthen vessels!

   carried out their views of the rendering of the aorist too rigidly in
   this chapter. There can be little doubt that some of the aorists are in
   effect perfects. We may quote the following sentences from Buttmann's
   Grammar of the New Testament Greek; "That the aorist may stand for the
   perfect, has been denied by many grammarians in reference to ordinary
   Greek usage, and by Winer in reference to the New Testament also, yet
   with too little qualification. As in so many other instances, the
   question depends simply upon our connecting the correct idea with the
   grammatical terminology; that is to say, inasmuch as the relation of
   time expressed by the perfect is compounded, as it were, of that of the
   aorist and that of the present, in cases where the aorist is used in
   the sense of the perfect, we must take this view of the matter, -- that
   the aorist was not intended to express both relations of the perfect at
   once, but that the writer for the moment withdraws from the present and
   places himself in the past, consequently in the position of a narrator.
   This position is uniformly the most natural for the act of composition,
   and from it there results of itself, if not a positive aversion to the
   perfect, yet a greater preference for the aorist. The continuance of
   the action, therefore, and its effect down to the present time,
   resides, not indeed in the tense, but in the connection; and the
   necessary insertion of the relation is left in every case to the
   hearer." -- Pp. 197-8, American Edition.

  SECTION I. "ALL THE DISCIPLES FORSOOK HIM, AND FLED."

    Matt. 26:36-41; 55, 56; 69-75; John 18:15-18.

   From the supper-chamber, in which we have lingered so long, we pass
   into the outside world, to witness the behavior of the eleven in the
   great final crisis. The passages cited describe the part they played in
   the solemn scenes connected with their Master's end. That part was a
   sadly unheroic one. Faith, love, principle, all gave way before the
   instincts of fear, shame, and self-preservation. The best of the
   disciples -- the three who, as most reliable, were selected by Jesus to
   keep Him company in the garden of Gethsemane -- utterly failed to
   render the service expected of them. While their Lord was passing
   through His agony, they fell asleep, as they had done before on the
   Mount of Transfiguration. Even the picked men thus proved themselves to
   be raw recruits, unable to shake off drowsiness while they did duty as
   sentinels. "What! could ye not watch with me one hour?" Then, when the
   enemy appeared, both these three and the other eight ran away
   panic-stricken. "All the disciples forsook Him, and fled." And finally,
   that one of their number who thought himself bolder than his brethren,
   not only forsook, but denied his beloved Master, declaring with an
   oath, "I know not the man."

   The conduct of the disciples at this crisis in their history, so weak
   and so unmanly, naturally gives rise to two questions: How should they
   have acted? and why did they act as they did -- what were the causes of
   their failure?

   Now, to take up the former of these questions first, when we try to
   form to ourselves a distinct idea of the course of action demanded by
   fidelity, it is not at once quite apparent wherein the disciples, Peter
   of course excepted, were at fault. What could they do when their Lord
   was apprehended, but run away? Offer resistance? Jesus had positively
   forbidden that just immediately before. On the appearance of the band
   of armed men, "when they which were about Him saw what would follow,
   they said unto Him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?" [627] Without
   waiting for a reply, one of them smote the servant of the high priest,
   and cut off his right ear. The fighting disciple, John informs us, was
   Simon Peter. He had brought a sword with him, one of two in the
   possession of the company, from the supper-chamber to Gethsemane,
   thinking it might be needed, and fully minded to use it if there was
   occasion; and, coward as he proved himself afterwards among the
   serving-men and maids, he was no such arrant coward in the garden. He
   used his weapon boldly if not skillfully, and did some execution,
   though happily not of a deadly character. Thereupon Jesus interposed to
   prevent further bloodshed, uttering words variously reported, but in
   all the different versions clearly inculcating a policy of
   non-resistance. "Put up again thy sword into his place," He said to
   Peter, adding as His reason, "for all they that take the sword shall
   perish with the sword;." which was as much as to say, "In this kind of
   warfare we must necessarily have the worst of it." Then He went on to
   hint at higher reasons for non-resistance than mere considerations of
   prudence or expediency. "Thinkest thou," He asked the warlike disciple,
   "that I cannot now pray to my Father, and He shall presently give me
   more than twelve legions of angels? But how then shall the Scriptures
   be fulfilled, that thus it must be?" [628] He could meet human force by
   superior, divine, celestial force if He chose, but He did not choose;
   for to overpower His enemies would be to defeat His own purpose in
   coming to the world, which was to conquer, not by physical force, but
   by truth and love and godlike patience; by drinking the cup which His
   Father had put into His hands, bitter though it was to flesh and blood.
   [629]

   Quite in harmony with these utterances in Gethsemane are the statements
   made by Jesus on the same subject ere He left the supper-room, as
   recorded by Luke. [630] In the letter, indeed, these statements seem to
   point at a policy the very opposite of non-resistance. Jesus seems to
   say that the great business and duty of the hour, for all who are on
   His side, is to furnish themselves with swords: so urgent is the need,
   that he who wants a weapon must sell his garment to buy one. But the
   very emphasis with which He speaks shows that His words are not to be
   taken in the literal prosaic sense. It is very easy to see what He
   means. His object is by graphic language to convey to His disciples an
   idea of the gravity of the situation. "Now," He would say, "now is the
   day, yea, the hour of battle: if my kingdom be one of this world, as ye
   have imagined, now is the time for fighting, not for dreaming; now
   matters have come to extremities, and ye have need of all your
   resources: equip yourselves with shoes and purse and knapsack, and
   above all, with swords and warlike courage."

   The disciples did not understand their Lord's meaning. They put a
   stupid, prosaic interpretation upon this part, as upon so many other
   parts, of His farewell discourse. So, with ridiculous seriousness, they
   said: "Lord, behold, here are two swords." The foolish remark provoked
   a reply which should surely have opened their eyes, and kept Peter from
   carrying the matter so far as to take one of the swords with him. "It
   is enough," said Jesus, probably with a melancholy smile on His face,
   as He thought of the stupid simplicity of those dear childish and
   childlike men: "It is enough." Two swords: well, they are enough only
   for one who does not mean to fight at all. What were two swords for
   twelve men, and against a hundred weapons of offence? The very idea of
   fighting in the circumstances was preposterous: it had only to be
   broadly stated to appear an absurdity.

   The disciples, then, were not called on to fight for their Master, that
   He might not be delivered to the Jews. What else, then, should they
   have done? Was it their duty to suffer with Him, and, carrying out the
   professions of Peter, to go with Him to prison and to death? This was
   not required of them either. When Jesus surrendered Himself into the
   hands of His captors, He proffered the request that, while taking Him
   into custody, they should let His followers go their way. [631] This He
   did not merely out of compassion for them, but as the Captain of
   salvation making the best terms for Himself and for the interests of
   His kingdom; for it was not less necessary to these that the disciples
   should live than that He Himself should die. He gave Himself up to
   death, that there might be a gospel to preach; He desired the safety of
   His disciples, that there might be men to preach it. Manifestly,
   therefore, it was not the duty of the disciples to expose themselves to
   danger: their duty lay rather, one would say, in the direction of
   taking care of their life for future usefulness.

   Where, then, if not in failing to fight for or suffer with their Lord,
   did the fault of the eleven lie? It lay in their lack of faith.
   "Believe in God, and believe in me," Jesus had said to them at the
   commencement of His farewell address, and at the critical hour they did
   neither. They did not believe that all would yet end well both with
   them and their Master, and especially that God would provide for their
   safety without any sacrifice of principle, or even of dignity, on their
   part. They put confidence only in the swiftness of their feet. Had they
   possessed faith in God and in Jesus, they would have witnessed their
   Lord's apprehension without dismay, assured both of His return and of
   their own safety; and, as feeling might incline, would either have
   followed the officers of justice to see what happened, or, averse to
   exciting and painful scenes, would have retired quietly to their
   dwellings until the tragedy was finished. But wanting faith, they
   neither calmly followed nor calmly retired; but faithlessly and
   ignominiously forsook their Lord, and fled. The sin lay not so much in
   the outward act, but in the inward state of mind of which it was the
   index. They fled in unbelief and despair, as men whose hope was
   blasted, from a man whose cause was lost, and whom God had abandoned to
   His enemies.

   Having ascertained wherein the disciples were at fault, we have now to
   inquire into the causes of their misconduct; and here, at the outset,
   we recall to mind that Jesus anticipated the breakdown of His
   followers. He did not count on their fidelity, but expected desertion
   as a matter of course. When Peter offered to follow Him wheresoever He
   might go, He told him that ere cock-crowing next morning he would deny
   Him thrice. At the close of the farewell address He told all the
   disciples that they would leave Him alone. On the way to the Mount of
   Olives He repeated the statement in these terms: "All ye shall be
   offended because of me this night; for it is written, I will smite the
   Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad." [632]
   And on all these occasions the tone in which He spoke was rather
   prophetic than reproachful. He expected His disciples to be
   panic-stricken, just as one should expect sheep to flee on the
   appearance of a wolf, or women to faint in presence of a scene of
   carnage. From this leniency we should infer that, in the view of Jesus,
   the sin of the disciples was one of infirmity; and that this was the
   view which He took thereof, we know from the words He addressed to the
   three drowsy brethren in Gethsemane. "Watch and pray," He said to them,
   "that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but
   the flesh is weak." [633] The kind judgment thus expressed, though
   pronounced with special reference to the shortcoming of Peter, James,
   and John in the garden, manifestly applies to the whole conduct of all
   the disciples (not even excepting Peter's denial) throughout the
   terrible crisis. Jesus regarded the eleven as men whose attachment to
   Himself was above suspicion, but who were liable to fall, through the
   weakness of their flesh, on being exposed to sudden temptation.

   But what are we to understand by the weakness of the flesh? Mere
   instinctive love of life, dread of danger, fear of man? No; for these
   instincts continued with the apostles through life, without leading,
   except in one instance, to a repetition of their present misconduct.
   Not only the flesh of the disciples, but even the willing spirit, was
   weak. Their spiritual character at this season was deficient in certain
   elements which give steadiness to the good impulses of the heart, and
   mastery over the infirmities of sentient nature. The missing elements
   of strength were: forethought, clear perceptions of truth,
   self-knowledge, and the discipline of experience.

   For want of forethought it came to pass that the apprehension of their
   Lord took the eleven by surprise. This may seem hardly credible, after
   the frequent intimations Christ had given them of His approaching
   death; after the institution of the Supper, the farewell address, the
   reference to the traitor, the prophetic announcement concerning their
   own frailty, and the discourse about the sword, which was like a
   trumpet-peal calling to battle. Yet there can be no doubt that such was
   the fact. The eleven went out to Gethsemane without any definite idea
   of what was coming. These raw recruits actually did not know that they
   were on the march to the battle-field. The sleep of the three disciples
   in the garden is sufficient proof of this. Had the three sentinels been
   thoroughly impressed with the belief that the enemy was at hand, weary
   and sad though they were, they would not have fallen asleep. Fear would
   have kept them awake. "Know this, that if the good man of the house had
   known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and
   would not have suffered his house to be broken up."

   The breakdown of the disciples at the final crisis was due in part also
   to the want of clear perceptions of truth. They did not understand the
   doctrine concerning Christ. They believed their Master to be the
   Christ, the Son of the living God; but their faith was twined around a
   false theory of Messiah's mission and career. In that theory the cross
   had no place. So long as the cross was only spoken about, their theory
   remained firmly rooted in their minds, and the words of their Master
   were speedily forgotten. But when the cross at length actually came,
   when the things which Jesus had foretold began to be fulfilled, then
   their theory went down like a tree suddenly smitten by a whirlwind,
   carrying the woodbine plant of their faith along with it. From the
   moment that Jesus was apprehended, all that remained of faith in their
   minds was simply a regret that they had been mistaken: "We trusted that
   it had been He who should have redeemed Israel." How could any one act
   heroically in such circumstances?

   A third radical defect in the character of the disciples was
   self-ignorance. One who knows his weakness may become strong even at
   the weak point; but he who knows not his weak points cannot be strong
   at any point. Now the followers of Jesus did not know their weakness.
   They credited themselves with an amount of fidelity and valor which
   existed only in their imagination, all adopting as their own the
   sentiment of Peter: "Though I should die with Thee, yet will I not deny
   Thee." [634] Alas! they did not know how much fear of man was in them,
   how much abject cowardice in presence of danger. Of course, when danger
   actually appeared, the usual consequence of self-conscious valor
   followed. All these stout-hearted disciples forsook their Master, and
   fled.

   The last, and not the least, cause of weakness in the disciples was
   their inexperience of such scenes as they were now to pass through.
   Experience of war is one great cause of the coolness and courage of
   veteran soldiers in the midst of danger. Practical acquaintance with
   the perils of military life makes them callous and fearless. But
   Christ's disciples were not yet veterans. They were now but entering
   into their first engagement. Hitherto they had experienced only such
   trials as befall even the rawest recruits. They had been called on to
   leave home, friends, fishing-boats, and their earthly all, to follow
   Jesus. But these initial hardships do not make a soldier; no, nor even
   the discipline of the drill-sergeant, nor the donning of a uniform. For
   behold the green soft youth with his bright uniform brought face to
   face with the stern reality of battle. His knees smite each other, his
   heart sickens, perchance he faints outright, and is carried to the
   rear, unable to take any part in the fight. Poor lad, pity him, do not
   scorn him; he may turn out a brave soldier yet. Even Frederick the
   Great ran away from his first battle. The bravest of soldiers probably
   do not feel very heroic the first time they are under fire.

   These observations help us to understand how it came to pass that the
   little flock was scattered when Jesus their shepherd was smitten. The
   explanation amounts in substance to a proof that the disciples were
   sheep, not yet fit to be shepherds of men. That being so, we do not
   wonder at the leniency of Jesus, to which reference has already been
   made. No one expects sheep to do any thing else than flee when the wolf
   cometh. Only in shepherds is craven fear severely reprehensible.
   Bearing this in mind, we shall more readily forgive Peter for denying
   his Lord in an unguarded moment, than for his cowardice at Antioch some
   years after, when he gave the cold shoulder to his Gentile brethren,
   through fear of the Jewish sectaries from Jerusalem. Peter was a
   shepherd then, and it was his duty to lead the sheep, or even to carry
   them against their inclination into the wide green pastures of
   Christian liberty, instead of tamely following those who, by their
   scrupulosity, showed themselves to be but lambs in Christ's flock. His
   actual behavior was very culpable and very mischievous. For though in
   reality not leading, but led, he, as an apostle, enjoyed the reputation
   and influence of a chief shepherd, and therefore had no option but
   either to lead or to mislead; and he did mislead, to such an extent
   that even Barnabas was carried away by his dissimulation. It is a
   serious thing for the Church when those who are shepherds in office and
   influence are sheep in opinion and heart; leaders in name, led in fact.

  SECTION II. SIFTED AS WHEAT

    Luke xxii. 31, 32.

   This fragment of the conversation at the supper-table is important, as
   showing us the view taken by Jesus of the crisis through which His
   disciples were about to pass. In form an address to Peter, it is really
   a word in season to all, and concerning all. This is evident from the
   use of the plural pronoun in addressing the disciple directly spoken
   to. "Satan," says Jesus, "hath desired to have (not thee, but) you:."
   thee, Simon, and also all thy brethren along with thee. The same thing
   appears from the injunction laid on Peter to turn his fall to account
   for the benefit of his brethren. The brethren, of course, are not the
   other disciples then present alone, but all who should believe as well.
   The apostles, however, are not to be excluded from the brotherhood who
   were to be benefited by Peter's experience; on the contrary, they are
   probably the parties principally and in the first place intended.

   Looking, then, at this utterance as expressive of the judgment of Jesus
   on the character of the ensuing crisis in the history of the future
   apostles, we find in it three noticeable particulars.

   1. First, Jesus regards the crisis as a sifting-time for the disciples.
   Satan, the accuser of the brethren, skeptical of their fidelity and
   integrity, as of Job's and of all good men's, was to sift them as
   wheat, hopeful that they would turn out mere chaff, and become
   apostates like Judas, or at least that they would make a miserable and
   scandalous breakdown. In this respect this final crisis was like the
   one at Capernaum a year before. That also was a sifting-time for
   Christ's discipleship. Chaff and wheat were then, too, separated, the
   chaff proving to be out of all proportion to the wheat, for "many went
   back, and walked no more with Him."

   But alongside of this general resemblance between the two crises, --
   the minor and the major we may call them, -- an important difference is
   to be observed. In the minor crisis, the chosen few were the pure
   wheat, the fickle multitude being the chaff; in the major, they are
   both wheat and chaff in one, and the sifting is not between man and
   man, but between the good and the bad, the precious and the vile, in
   the same man. The hearts of the eleven faithful ones are to be
   searched, and all their latent weakness discovered: the old man is to
   be divided asunder from the new; the vain, self-confident, self-willed,
   impetuous Simon son of Jonas, from the devoted, chivalrous, heroic,
   rock-like Peter.

   This distinction between the two crises implies that the later was of a
   more searching character than the earlier; and that it was so indeed,
   is obvious on a moment's reflection. Consider only how different the
   situation of the disciples in the two cases! In the minor crisis, the
   multitude go, but Jesus remains; in the major, Jesus Himself is taken
   from them, and they are left as sheep without a shepherd. A mighty
   difference truly, sufficiently explaining the difference in the conduct
   of the same men on the two occasions. It was no doubt very
   disappointing and disheartening to see the mass of people who had
   lately followed their Master with enthusiasm, dispersing like an idle
   mob after seeing a show. But while the Master remained, they would not
   break their hearts about the defection of spurious disciples. They
   loved Jesus for His own sake, not for His popularity or for any other
   by-end. He was their teacher, and could give them the bread of eternal
   truth, which, and not the bread that perisheth, was what they were in
   quest of: He was their Head, their Father, their Elder Brother, their
   spiritual Husband, and they would cling to Him through all fortunes,
   with filial, brotherly, wifely fidelity, He being more to them than the
   whole world outside. If their prospects looked dark even with Him,
   where could they go to be any better? They had no choice but to remain
   where they were.

   Remain accordingly they did, faithfully, manfully; kept steadfast by
   sincerity, a clear perception of the alternatives, and ardent love to
   their Lord. But now, alas! when it is not the multitude, but Jesus
   Himself, that leaves them, -- not forsaking them, indeed, but torn from
   them by the strong hand of worldly power, -- what are they to do? Now
   they may well ask Peter's question, "To whom shall we go?" despairing
   of an answer. He whose presence was their solace at a trying,
   discouraging season, who at the worst, even when His doctrine was
   mysterious and His conduct incomprehensible, was more to them than all
   else in the world at its best; even He is rift from their side, and now
   they are utterly forlorn, without a master, a champion, a guide, a
   friend, a father. Worse still, in losing Him they lose not merely their
   best friend, but their faith. They could believe Jesus to be the
   Christ, although the multitude apostatized; for they could regard such
   apostasy as the effect of ignorance, shallowness, insincerity. But how
   can they believe in the Messiahship of one who is led away to prison in
   place of a throne; and instead of being crowned a king, is on His way
   to be executed as a felon? Bereft of Jesus in this fashion, they are
   bereft of their Christ as well. The unbelieving world asks them, "Where
   is thy God?" and they can make no reply.

   "Christ and we against the world;." "Christ in the world's power, and
   we left alone:." such, in brief, was the difference between the two
   sifting seasons. The results of the sifting process were
   correspondingly diverse. In the one case, it separated between the
   sincere and the insincere; in the other, it discovered weakness even in
   the sincere. The men who on the earlier occasion stood resolutely to
   their colors, on the later fled panic-stricken, consulting for their
   safety without dignity, and, in one case at least, with shameful
   disregard of truth. Behold how weak even good men are without faith!
   With faith, however crude or ill-informed, you may overcome the whole
   world; without the faith that places God consciously at your side, you
   have no chance. Satan will get possession of you and sift you, and
   cause you to equivocate with Abraham, feign madness with David,
   dissemble and swear falsely or profanely with Peter. No one can tell
   how far you may fall if you lose faith in God. The just live justly,
   nobly, only by their faith.

   2. Jesus regards the crisis through which His disciples are to pass as
   one which, though perilous, shall not prove deadly to their faith. His
   hope is that though they fall, they shall not fall away; though the sun
   of faith be eclipsed, it shall not be extinguished. He has this hope
   even in regard to Peter, having taken care to avert so disastrous a
   catastrophe. "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not." And the
   result was as He anticipated. The disciples showed themselves weak in
   the final crisis, but not wicked. Satan tripped them up, but he did not
   enter into and possess them. In this respect they differed to toto
   caelo from Judas, who not only lost his faith, but cast away his love,
   and, abandoning his Lord, went over to the enemy, and became a tool for
   the accomplishment of their wicked designs. The eleven, at their worst,
   continued faithful to their Master in heart. They neither committed,
   nor were capable of committing, acts of perfidy, but even in fleeing
   identified themselves with the losing side.

   But Peter, what of him? was not he an exception to this statement?
   Well, he certainly did more than fail in faith; and we have no wish to
   extenuate the gravity of his offence, but would rather see in it a
   solemn illustration of the close proximity into which the best men may
   be brought with the worst. At the same time, it is only just to remark
   that there is a wide difference between denying Christ among the
   servants of the high priest, and betraying Him into the hands of the
   high priest himself for a sum of money. The latter act is the crime of
   a traitor knave; the former might be committed by one who would be true
   to his master on all occasions in which his interests seemed seriously
   involved. In denying Jesus, Peter thought that he was saving himself by
   dissimulation, without doing any material injury to his Lord. His act
   resembled that of Abraham when he circulated the lying story about his
   wife being his sister, to protect himself from the violence of
   licentious strangers. That was certainly a very mean, selfish act, most
   unworthy of the father of the faithful. Peter's act was not less mean
   and selfish, but also not more. Both were acts of weakness rather than
   of wickedness, for which few, even among good men, can afford to throw
   stones at the patriarch and the disciple. Even those who play the hero
   on great occasions will at other times act very unworthily. Many men
   conceal and belie their convictions at the dinner-table, who would
   boldly proclaim their sentiments from the pulpit or the platform.
   Standing in the place where Christ's servants are expected to speak the
   truth, they draw their swords bravely in defense of their Lord; but,
   mixing in society on equal terms, they too often say in effect, "I know
   not the man." Peter's offence, therefore, if grave, is certainly not
   uncommon. It is committed virtually, if not formally, by multitudes who
   are utterly incapable of public deliberate treason against truth and
   God. The erring disciple was much more singular in his repentance than
   in his sin. Of all who in mere acts of weakness virtually deny Christ,
   how few, like him, go out and weep bitterly!

   That Peter did not fall as Judas fell, utterly and irrevocably, was due
   in part to a radical difference between the two men. Peter was at heart
   a child of God; Judas, in the core of his being, had been all along a
   child of Satan. Therefore we may say that Peter could not have sinned
   as Judas sinned, nor could Judas have repented as Peter repented. Yet,
   while we say this, we must not forget that Peter was kept from falling
   away by special grace granted to him in answer to his Master's prayers.
   The precise terms in which Jesus prayed for Peter we do not know; for
   the prayer in behalf of the one disciple has not, like that for the
   whole eleven, been recorded. But the drift of these special
   intercessions is plain, from the account given of them by Jesus to
   Peter. The Master had prayed that His disciple's faith might not fail.
   He had not prayed that he might be exempt from Satan's sifting process,
   or even kept from falling; for He knew that a fall was necessary, to
   show the self-confident disciple his own weakness. He had prayed that
   Peter's fall might not be ruinous; that his grievous sin might be
   followed by godly sorrow, not by hardening of heart, or, as in the case
   of the traitor, by the sorrow of the world, which worketh death: the
   remorse of a guilty conscience, which, like the furies, drives the
   sinner headlong to damnation. And in Peter's repentance, immediately
   after his denials, we see the fulfilment of his Master's prayer,
   special grace being given to melt his heart, and overwhelm him with
   generous grief, and cause him to weep out his soul in tears. Not by his
   piety or goodness of heart was the salutary result produced, but by
   God's Spirit and God's providence conspiring to that end. But for the
   cock-crowing, and the warning words it recalled to mind, and the glance
   of Jesus' eye, and the tender mercy of the Father in heaven, who can
   tell what sullen devilish humors might have taken possession of the
   guilty disciple's heart! Remember how long even the godly David gave
   place to the devil, and harbored in his bosom the demons of pride,
   falsehood, and impenitence, after his grievous fall; and see how far it
   was from being a matter of course that Peter, immediately after denying
   Christ, should come under the blessed influence of a broken and
   contrite spirit, or even that the spiritual crisis through which he
   passed had a happy issue at all. By grace he was saved, as are we all.

   3. Jesus regards the crisis about to be gone through by His disciples
   as one which shall not only end happily, but result in spiritual
   benefit to themselves, and qualify them for being helpful to others.
   This appears from the injunction He lays on Peter: "When thou art
   converted, strengthen thy brethren." Jesus expects the frail disciple
   to become strong in grace, and so able and willing to help the weak. He
   cherishes this expectation with respect to all, but specially in regard
   to Peter, assuming that the weakest might and ought eventually to
   become the strongest; the last first, the greatest sinner the greatest
   saint; the most foolish the wisest, most benignant, and sympathetic of
   men.

   How encouraging this genial, kindly view of moral shortcoming to such
   as have erred! The Saviour says to them in effect, There is no cause
   for despair: sin cannot only be forgiven, but it can even be turned to
   good account both for yourselves and for others. Falls, rightly
   improved, may become stepping-stones to Christian virtue, and a
   training for the office of a comforter and guide. How healing such a
   view to the troubled conscience! Men who have erred, and who take a
   serious thought of their sin, are apt to consume their hearts and waste
   their time in bitter reflections on their past misconduct. Christ gives
   them more profitable work to do. "When thou art converted," He says to
   them, "strengthen thy brethren:." cease from idle regrets over the
   irrevocable past, and devote thyself heart and soul to labors of love;
   and let it help thee to forgive thyself, that from thy very faults and
   follies thou mayest learn the meekness, patience, compassion, and
   wisdom necessary for carrying on such labors with success.

   But while very encouraging to those who have sinned, Christ's words to
   Simon contain no encouragement to sin. It is a favorite doctrine with
   some, -- that we may do evil that good may come; that we must be
   prodigals in order to be good Christians; that a mud bath must precede
   the washing of regeneration and the baptism of the soul in the
   Redeemer's blood. This is a false, pernicious doctrine, of which the
   Holy One could not be the patron. Do evil that good may come, say you?
   And what if the good come not? It does not come, as we have seen, as a
   matter of course; nor is it the likelier to come that you make the hope
   of its coming the pretext for sinning. If the good ever come, it will
   come through the strait gate of repentance. You can become wise,
   gracious, meek, sympathetic, a burden-bearer to the weak, only by going
   out first and weeping bitterly. But what chance is there of such a
   penitential melting of heart appearing in one who adopts and acts on
   the principle that a curriculum of sin is necessary to the attainment
   of insight, self-knowledge, compassion, and all the humane virtues? The
   probable issue of such a training is a hardened heart, a seared
   conscience, a perverted moral judgment, the extirpation of all earnest
   convictions respecting the difference between right and wrong; the
   opinion that evil leads to good insensibly transforming itself into the
   idea that evil is good, and fitting its advocate for committing sin
   without shame or compunction.


   "And dare we to this fancy give,

   That had the wild-oat not been sown,

   The soil, left barren, scarce had grown

   The grain by which a man may live?


   Oh, if we held the doctrine sound,

   For life outliving heats of youth;

   Yet who would preach it as a truth

   To those that eddy round and round?


   Hold thou the good: define it well:

   For fear divine Philosophy

   Should push beyond her mark, and be

   Procuress to the lords of hell." [635]

   In Peter's case good did come out of evil. The sifting time formed a
   turning-point in his spiritual history: the sifting process had for its
   result a second conversion more thorough than the first, -- a turning
   from sin, not merely in general, but in detail; from besetting sins, in
   better informed if not more fervent repentance, and with a purpose of
   new obedience less self-reliant, but just on that account more
   reliable. A child hitherto, -- a child of God, indeed, yet only a
   child, -- Peter became a man strong in grace, and fit to bear the
   burden of the weak. Yet it is worthy of notice, as showing how little
   sympathy the Author of our faith had with the doctrine that evil may be
   done for the sake of good, that Jesus, while aware how Peter's fall
   would end, did not on that account regard it as desirable. He said not,
   "I have desired to sift thee," but assigns the task of sifting the
   disciple to the evil spirit who in the beginning tempted our first
   parent to sin by the specious argument, "Ye shall be as gods, knowing
   good and evil," reserving to Himself the part of an intercessor, who
   prays that the evil permitted may be overruled for good. "Satan hath
   desired to have you:." "I have prayed for thee." What words could more
   strongly convey the idea of guilt and peril than these, which intimate
   that Simon is about to do a deed which is an object of desire to the
   evil one, and which makes it necessary that he should be specially
   prayed for by the Saviour of souls? Men must go elsewhere in quest of
   support for apologetic or pantheistic views of sin.

   But it may be thought that the reference to Satan tends in another way
   to weaken moral earnestness, by encouraging men to throw the blame of
   their falls on him. Theoretically plausible, this objection is
   practically contrary to fact; for the patrons of lax notions of sin are
   also the unbelievers in the personality of the devil. "The further the
   age has removed from the idea of a devil, the laxer it has become in
   the imputation and punishment of sin. The older time, which did not
   deny the temptations and assaults of the devil, was yet so little
   inclined on that account to excuse men, that it regarded the neglect of
   resistance against the evil spirit, or the yielding to him, as the
   extreme degree of guilt, and exercised against it a judicial severity
   from which we shrink with horror. The opposite extreme to this
   strictness is the laxity of recent criminal jurisprudence, in which
   judges and physicians are too much inclined to excuse the guilty from
   physical or psychical grounds, while the moral judgment of public
   opinion is slack and indulgent. It is undeniable that to every sin not
   only a bad will, but also the spell of some temptation, contributes;
   and when temptation is not ascribed to the devil, the sinner does not
   on that account impute blame to his bad will, but to temptations
   springing from some other quarter, which he does not derive from sin,
   but from nature, although nature tempts only when under the influence
   of sin. The world and the flesh are indeed powers of temptation, not
   through their natural substance, but through the influence of the bad
   with which they are infected. But when, as at present, the seduction to
   evil is referred to sensuality, temperament, physical lusts and
   passions, circumstances, or fixed ideas, monomanias, etc., guilt is
   taken off the sinner's shoulders, and laid upon something ethically
   indifferent or simply natural." [636]

   The view presented by Jesus of His disciple's fall cannot therefore be
   charged with weakening the sense of responsibility; on the contrary, it
   is a view tending at once to inspire hatred of sin and hope for the
   sinner. It exhibits sin about to be committed as an object of fear and
   abhorrence; and, already committed, as not only forgivable, being
   repented of, but as capable of being made serviceable to spiritual
   progress. It says to us, on the one hand, Trifle not with temptation,
   for Satan is near, seeking thy soul's ruin, -- "fear, and sin not;."
   and, on the other hand, "If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the
   Father, Jesus Christ the righteous," -- despair not: forsake thy sins,
   and thou shalt find mercy.

  SECTION III. PETER AND JOHN

    John xviii. 15-18.

   Though all the disciples, without exception, forsook Jesus at the
   moment of His apprehension, two of them soon recovered their courage
   sufficiently to return from flight, and follow after their Master as He
   was being led away to judgment. One of these was Simon Peter, ever
   original both in good and in evil, who, we are told, followed Jesus
   "afar off unto the high priest's palace, to see the end." [637] The
   other, according to the general, and we think correct, opinion of
   interpreters, was John. He is indeed not named, but merely described as
   another, or rather the other, disciple; but as John himself is our
   informant, the fact is almost certain evidence that he is the person
   alluded to. "The other disciple," who "was known unto the high priest,
   and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest," [638] is
   the well-known unnamed one who so often meets us in the fourth Gospel.
   Had the man whose conduct was so outstanding been any other than the
   evangelist, he would certainly not have remained nameless in a
   narrative so minutely exact, that even the name of the servant whose
   ear Peter cut off is not deemed too insignificant to be recorded. [639]

   These two disciples, though very different in character, seem to have
   had a friendship for each other. On various occasions besides the
   present we find their names associated in a manner suggestive of a
   special attachment. At the supper-table, when the announcement
   concerning the traitor had been made, Peter gave the disciple whom
   Jesus loved a sign that he should ask who it should be of whom He
   spake. Three times in the interval between the resurrection and the
   ascension the two brethren were linked together as companions. They ran
   together to the sepulchre on the resurrection morning. They talked
   together confidentially concerning the stranger who appeared at early
   dawn on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, when they were out on their
   last fishing expedition, the disciple whom Jesus loved, on recognizing
   the Risen One, saying unto Peter, "It is the Lord." They walked
   together shortly after on the shore, following Jesus, -- Peter by
   commandment, John by the voluntary impulse of his own loving heart. An
   intimacy cemented by such sacred associations was likely to be
   permanent, and we find the two disciples still companions after they
   had entered on the duties of the apostleship. They went up together
   into the temple at the hour of prayer; and, having got into trouble
   through the healing of the lame man at the temple gate, they appeared
   together before the ecclesiastical tribunal, to be tried by the very
   same men, Annas and Caiaphas, who had sat in judgment upon their Lord,
   companions now at the bar, as they had been before in the palace, of
   the high priest.

   Such a friendship between the two disciples as these facts point to, is
   by no means surprising. As belonging to the inner circle of three whom
   Jesus honored with His confidence on special occasions, they had
   opportunities for becoming intimate, and were placed in circumstances
   tending to unite them in the closest bonds of spiritual brotherhood.
   And, notwithstanding their characteristic differences, they were fitted
   to be special friends. They were both men of marked originality and
   force of character, and they would find in each other more sources of
   interest than in the more commonplace members of the apostolic band.
   Their very peculiarities, too, far from keeping them apart, would
   rather draw them together. They were so constituted that each would
   find in the otter the complement of himself. Peter was masculine, John
   was feminine, in temperament; Peter was the man of action, John the man
   of thought and feeling; Peter's part was to be a leader and a champion,
   John's was to cling, and trust, and be loved; Peter was the hero, and
   John the admirer of heroism.

   In their respective behavior at this crisis, the two friends were at
   once like and unlike each other. They were like in this, that they both
   manifested a generous solicitude about the fate of their Master. While
   the rest retired altogether from the scene, they followed to see the
   end. The common action proceeded in both probably from the same
   motives. What these motives were we are not told, but it is not
   difficult to guess. A certain influence may be assigned, in the first
   place, to natural activity of spirit. It was not in the nature either
   of Peter or of John to be listless and passive while such grave events
   were going on. They could not sit at home doing nothing while their
   Lord was being tried, sentenced, and treated as a malefactor. If they
   cannot prevent, they will at least witness, His last sufferings. The
   same irrepressible energy of mind which, three days after, made these
   two disciples run to see the empty grave, now impels them to turn their
   steps towards the judgment-hall to witness the transactions there.

   Besides activity of mind, we perceive in the conduct of the two
   disciples a certain spirit of daring at work. We learn from the Acts of
   the Apostles, that when Peter and John appeared before the council in
   Jerusalem, the rulers were struck with their boldness. Their boldness
   then was only what was to be expected from men who had behaved as they
   did at this crisis. By that time, it is true, they had, in common with
   all their brethren, experienced a great spiritual change; but yet we
   cannot fail to recognize the identity of the characters. The apostles
   had but grown to such spiritual manhood as they gave promise of in the
   days of their discipleship. For it was a brave thing in them to follow,
   even at a distance, the band which had taken Jesus a prisoner. The
   rudiments at least of the martyr character were in men who could do
   that. Mere cowards would not have acted so. They would have eagerly
   availed themselves of the virtual sanction given by Jesus to flight,
   comforting their hearts with the thought that, in consulting for their
   safety, they were but doing the duty enjoined on them.

   But the conduct of the two brethren sprang, we believe, mainly from
   their ardent love to Jesus. When the first paroxysm of fear was past,
   solicitude for personal safety gave place to generous concern about the
   fate of one whom they really loved more than life. The love of Christ
   constrained them to think not of themselves, but of Him whose hour of
   sorrow was come. First they slacken their pace, then they halt, then
   they look round; and as they see the armed band nearing the city, they
   are cut to the heart, and they say within themselves, "We cannot leave
   our dear Master in His time of peril; we must see the issue of this
   painful business." And so with anguished spirit they set out towards
   Jerusalem, Peter first, and John after him.

   The two brethren, companions thus far, diverged widely on arriving at
   the scene of trial and suffering. John clung to his beloved Lord to the
   last. He was present, it would appear, at the various examinations to
   which Jesus was subjected, and heard with his own ears the judicial
   process of which he has given so interesting an account in his Gospel.
   When the iniquitous sentence was executed, he was a spectator. He took
   his stand by the foot of the cross, where he could see all, and not
   only be seen, but even be spoken to, by his dying Master. There he saw,
   among other things, the strange phenomenon of blood and water flowing
   from the spear-wound in the Saviour's side, which he so carefully
   records in his narrative. There he heard Christ's dying words, and
   among them those addressed to Mary of Nazareth and himself: to her,
   "Woman, behold thy son;." to him, "Behold thy mother."

   John was thus persistently faithful throughout. And Peter, what of him?
   Alas! what need to tell the familiar story of his deplorable weakness
   in the hall or inner court of the high priest's palace? how, having
   obtained an entrance through the street door by the intercession of his
   brother disciple, he first denied to the portress his connection with
   Jesus; then repeated his denial to other parties, with the addition of
   a solemn oath; then, irritated by the repetition of the charge, and
   perhaps by the consciousness of guilt, a third time declared, not with
   a solemn oath, but with the degrading accompaniment of profane
   swearing, "I know not the man;." then, finally, hearing the cock crow,
   and catching Jesus' eye, and remembering the words, "Before the cock
   crow thou shalt deny me thrice," went out to the street and wept
   bitterly!

   What became of Peter after this melancholy exhibition we are not
   informed. In all probability he retired to his lodging, humbled,
   dispirited, crushed, there to remain overwhelmed with grief and shame,
   till he was roused from stupor by the stirring tidings of the
   resurrection morn.

   This difference in conduct between the two disciples corresponded to a
   difference in their characters. Each acted according to his nature. It
   is true, indeed, that the circumstances were not the same for both
   parties, being favorable for one, unfavorable for the other. John had
   the advantage of a friend at court, being somehow known to the high
   priest. This circumstance gained him admission into the chamber of
   judgment, and gave him security against all personal risk. Peter, on
   the other hand, not only had no friends at court, but might not
   unnaturally fear the presence there of personal foes. He had made
   himself obnoxious by his rash act in the garden, and might be
   apprehensive of getting into trouble in consequence. That such fears
   would not have been altogether groundless, we learn from the fact
   stated by John, that one of the persons who charged Peter with being a
   disciple of Jesus was a kinsman of the man whose ear Peter had cut off,
   and that he brought his charge against the disciple in this form: "Did
   I not see thee in the garden with Him?" It is therefore every way
   likely that the consciousness of having committed an offence which
   might be resented, made Peter anxious to escape identification as one
   of Christ's disciples. His unseasonable courage in the garden helped to
   make him a coward in the palace-yard.

   Making all due allowance for the effect of circumstances, however, we
   think that the difference in the behavior of the two disciples was
   mainly due to a difference in the men themselves. Though he had been
   guilty of no imprudence in the garden, Peter, we fear, would have
   denied Jesus in the hall; and, on the other hand, supposing John had
   been placed in Peter's position, we do not believe that he would have
   committed Peter's sin. Peter's disposition laid him open to temptation,
   while John's, on the other hand, was a protection against temptation.
   Peter was frank and familiar, John was dignified and reserved; Peter's
   tendency was to be on hail fellow-well-met terms with everybody, John
   could keep his own place and make other people keep theirs. It is easy
   to see what an important effect this distinction would have on the
   conduct of parties placed in Peter's position. Suppose John in Peter's
   place, and let us see how he might have acted. Certain persons about
   the court, possessing neither authority nor influence, interrogate him
   about his connection with Jesus. He is neither afraid nor ashamed to
   acknowledge his Lord, but nevertheless he turns away and gives the
   interrogators no answer. They have no right to question him. The spirit
   which prompts their questions is one with which he has no sympathy, and
   he feels that it will serve no good purpose to confess his discipleship
   to such people. Therefore, like his Master when confronted with the
   false witnesses, he holds his peace, and withdraws from company with
   which he has nothing in common, and for which he has no respect.

   To protect himself from inconvenient interrogation by such dignified
   reserve, is beyond Peter's capacity. He cannot keep people who are not
   fit company for him at their distance; he is too frank, too familiar,
   too sensitive to public opinion, without respect to its quality. If a
   servant-maid ask him a question about his relation to the Prisoner at
   the bar, he cannot brush past her as if he heard her not. He must give
   her an answer; and as he feels instinctively that the animus of the
   question is against his Master, his answer must needs be a lie. Then,
   unwarned by this encounter of the danger arising from too close contact
   with the hangers-on about the palace, the foolish disciple must involve
   himself more inextricably into the net, by mingling jauntily with the
   servants and officers gathered around the fire which has been kindled
   on the pavement of the open court. Of course he has no chance of escape
   here; he is like a poor fly caught in a spider's web. If these men,
   with the insolent tone of court menials, charge him with being a
   follower of the man whom their masters have now got into their power,
   he can do nothing else than blunder out a mean, base denial. Poor Peter
   is manifestly not equal to the situation. It would have been wiser in
   him to have staid at home, restraining his curiosity to see the end.
   But he, like most men, was to learn wisdom only by bitter experience.

   The contrast we have drawn between the characters of the two disciples
   suggests the thought, What a different thing growth in grace may be for
   different Christians! Neither John nor Peter was mature as yet, but
   immaturity showed itself in them in opposite ways. Peter's weakness lay
   in the direction of indiscriminate cordiality. His tendency was to be
   friends with everybody. John, on the other hand, was in no danger of
   being on familiar terms with all and sundry. It was rather too easy for
   him to make a difference between friends and foes. He could take a
   side, and keep it; he could even hate with fanatical intensity, as well
   as love with beautiful womanly devotion. Witness his proposal to call
   down fire from heaven to consume the Samaritan villages! That was a
   proposal which Peter could not have made; it was not in his nature to
   be so truculent against any human being. So far, his good nature was a
   thing to be commended, if in other respects it laid him open to
   temptation. The faults of the two brethren being so opposite, growth in
   grace would naturally assume two opposite forms in their respective
   experiences. In Peter it would take the form of concentration; in John,
   of expansion. Peter would become less charitable; John would become
   more charitable. Peter would advance from indiscriminate goodwill to a
   moral decidedness which should distinguish between friends and foes,
   the Church and the world; John's progress, on the other hand, would
   consist in ceasing to be a bigot, and in becoming imbued with the
   genial, humane, sympathetic spirit of his Lord. Peter, in his mature
   state, would care much less for the opinions and feelings of men than
   he did at the present time; John, again, would care much more.

   We add a word on the question, Was it right or was it wrong in these
   two disciples to follow their Lord to the place of judgment? In our
   view it was neither right nor wrong in itself. It was right for one who
   was able to do it without spiritual harm; wrong for one who had reason
   to believe that, by doing it, he was exposing himself to harm. The
   latter was Peter's case, as the former seems to have been John's. Peter
   had been plainly warned of his weakness; and, had he laid the warning
   to heart, he would have avoided the scene of temptation. By
   disregarding the warning, he wilfully rushed into the tempter's arms,
   and of course he caught a fall. His fall reads a lesson to all who,
   without seeking counsel of God or disregarding counsel given, enter on
   undertakings beyond their strength.

28. THE SHEPHERD RESTORED
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. TOO GOOD NEWS TO BE TRUE

    Matt. 28:17; Mark 16:11-15; Luke 24:11; 13-22; 36-42; John 20:20; 24-29.

   The black day of the crucifixion is past; the succeeding day, the
   Jewish Sabbath, when the Weary One slept in His rock-hewn tomb, is also
   past; the first day of a new week and of a new era has dawned, and the
   Lord is risen from the dead. The Shepherd has returned to gather His
   scattered sheep. Surely a happy day for hapless disciples! What
   rapturous joy must have thrilled their hearts at the thought of a
   reunion with their beloved Lord! with what ardent hope must they have
   looked forward to that resurrection morn!

   So one might think; but the real state of the case was not so. Such
   ardent expectations had no place in the minds of the disciples. The
   actual state of their minds at the resurrection of Christ rather
   resembled that of the Jewish exiles in Babylon, when they heard that
   they were to be restored to their native land. The first effect of the
   good news was that they were as men that dreamed. The news seemed too
   good to be true. The captives who had sat by the rivers of Babylon, and
   wept when they remembered Zion, had ceased to hope for a return to
   their own country, and indeed to be capable of hoping for any thing.
   "Grief was calm and hope was dead" within them. Then, when the exiles
   had recovered from the stupor of surprise, the next effect of the good
   tidings was a fit of over-joy. They burst into hysteric laughter and
   irrepressible song. [640]

   Very similar was the experience of the disciples in connection with the
   rising of Jesus from the dead. Their grief was not indeed calm, but
   their hope was dead. The resurrection of their Master was utterly
   unexpected by them, and they received the tidings with surprise and
   incredulity. This appears from the statements of all the four
   evangelists. Matthew states that on the occasion of Christ's meeting
   with His followers in Galilee after He was risen, some doubted, while
   others worshipped. [641] Mark relates that when the disciples heard
   from Mary Magdalene that Jesus was alive, and had been seen of her,
   "they believed not;." [642] and that when the two disciples who
   journeyed toward Emmaus told their brethren of their meeting with Jesus
   on the way, "neither believed they them." [643] He further relates how,
   on a subsequent occasion, when Jesus Himself met with the whole eleven
   at once, He "upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart,
   because they believed not them which had seen Him after He was risen."
   [644]

   In full accordance with these statements of the two first evangelists
   are those of Luke, whose representation of the mental attitude of the
   disciples towards the resurrection of Jesus is very graphic and
   animated. According to him, the reports of the women seemed to them "as
   idle tales, and they believed them not." [645] The two brethren vaguely
   alluded to by Mark as walking into the country when Jesus appeared to
   them, are represented by Luke as sad in countenance, though aware of
   the rumors concerning the resurrection; yea, as so depressed in
   spirits, that they did not recognize Jesus when He joined their company
   and entered into conversation with them. [646] The resurrection was not
   a fact for them: all they knew was that their Master was dead, and that
   they had vainly trusted that it had been He who should have redeemed
   Israel. The same evangelist also Informs us that on the first occasion
   when Jesus presented Himself in the midst of His disciples, they did
   recognize the resemblance of the apparition to their deceased Lord, but
   thought it was only His ghost, and accordingly were terrified and
   affrighted; insomuch that, in order to charm away their fear, Jesus
   showed them His hands and feet, and besought them to handle His body,
   and so satisfy themselves that He was no ghost, but a substantial human
   being, with flesh and bones like another man. [647]

   Instead of general statements, John gives an example of the incredulity
   of the disciples concerning the resurrection, as exhibited in its
   extreme form by Thomas. This disciple he represents as so incredulous,
   that he refused to believe until he should have put his finger into the
   prints of the nails, and thrust his hand into the wound made by the
   spear in the Saviour's side. That the other disciples shared the
   incredulity of Thomas, though in a less degree, is implied in the
   statement made by John in a previous part of his narrative, that when
   Jesus met His disciples on the evening of the day on which He rose, "He
   showed unto them His hands and His side." [648]

   The women who had believed in Christ had no more expectation of His
   resurrection than the eleven. They set forth towards the sepulchre on
   the morning of the first day of the week, with the intention of
   embalming the dead body of Him whom they loved. They sought the living
   among the dead. When the Magdalene, who was at the tomb before the
   rest, found the grave empty, her idea was that some one had carried
   away the dead body of her Lord. [649]

   When the incredulity of the disciples did at length give place to
   faith, they passed, like the Hebrew exiles, from extreme depression to
   extravagant joy. When the doubt of Thomas was removed, he exclaimed in
   rapture, "My Lord and my God!" [650] Luke relates that when they
   recognized their risen Lord, the disciples "believed not for joy,"
   [651] as if toying with doubt as a stimulus to joy. The two disciples
   with whom Jesus conversed on the way to Emmaus, said to each other when
   He left them, "Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us
   by the way, and while He opened to us the Scriptures?" [652]

   In yet another most important respect did the eleven resemble the
   ancient Hebrew exiles at the time of their recall. While their faith
   and hope were palsied during the interval between the death and the
   resurrection of Jesus, their love remained in unabated vitality. The
   expatriated Jew did not forget Jerusalem in the land of strangers.
   Absence only made his heart grow fonder. As he sat by the rivers of
   Babylon, listless, motionless, in abstracted dreamy mood, gazing with
   glassy eyes on the sluggish waters, the big round tears stole quietly
   down his cheeks, because he had been thinking of Zion. The exile of
   poetic soul did not forget what was due to Jerusalem's honor. He was
   incapable of singing the Lord's songs in the hearing of a heathen
   audience, who cared nothing for their meaning, but only for the style
   of execution. He disdained to prostitute his talents for the
   entertainment of the voluptuous oppressors of Israel, even though
   thereby he might procure his restoration to the beloved country of his
   birth, as the Athenian captives in Sicily are said to have done by
   reciting the strains of their favorite poet Euripides in the hearing of
   their Sicilian masters. [653]

   The disciples were not less true to the memory of their Lord. They were
   like a "widow indeed," who remains faithful to her deceased husband,
   and dotes on his virtues, though his reputation be at zero in the
   general esteem of the world. Call Him a deceiver who might, they could
   not believe that Jesus had been a deceiver. Mistaken He as well as they
   might have been, but an impostor -- never! Therefore, though He is dead
   and their hope gone, they still act as men who cherish the fondest
   attachment to their Master whom they have lost. They keep together like
   a bereaved family, with blinds down, so to speak, shutting and barring
   their doors for fear of the Jews, identifying themselves with the
   Crucified, and as His friends dreading the ill-will of the unbelieving
   world. Admirable example to all Christians how to behave themselves in
   a day of trouble, rebuke, and blasphemy, when the cause of Christ seems
   lost, and the powers of darkness for the moment have all things their
   own way. Though faith be eclipsed and hope extinguished, let the heart
   ever be loyal to its true Lord!

   The state of mind in which the disciples were at the resurrection of
   Jesus Christ from the dead, is of great moment in an apologetic point
   of view. Their despair after their Lord's crucifixion gives great
   weight to the testimony borne by them to the fact of His resurrection.
   Men in such a mood were not likely to believe in the latter event
   except because it could not reasonably be disbelieved. They would not
   be lightly satisfied of its truth, as men are apt to be in the case of
   events both desired and expected: they would skeptically exact
   superabundant evidence, as men do in the case of events desirable but
   not expected. They would be slow to believe on the testimony of others,
   and might even hesitate to believe their own eyes. They would not be
   able, as M. Renan supposes, to get up a belief in the resurrection of
   Jesus, from the simple fact that His grave was found empty on the third
   day after His death, by the women who went to embalm His body. That
   circumstance, on being reported, might make a Peter and a John run to
   the sepulchre to see how matters stood; but, after they had found the
   report of the women confirmed, it would still remain a question how the
   fact was to be explained; and Mary Magdalene's theory, that some one
   had carried off the corpse, would not appear at all improbable.

   These inferences of ours, from what we know concerning the mental
   condition of the disciples, are fully borne out by the Gospel accounts
   of the reception they gave to the risen Jesus at His first appearances
   to them. One and all of them regarded these appearances skeptically,
   and took pains to satisfy themselves, or made it necessary that Jesus
   should take pains to satisfy them, that the visible object was no
   ghostly apparition, but a living man, and that man none other than He
   who had died on the cross. The disciples doubted now the
   substantiality, now the identity, of the person who appeared to them.
   They were therefore not content with seeing Jesus, but at His own
   request handled Him. One of their number not only handled the body to
   ascertain that it possessed the incompressibility of matter, but
   insisted on examining with skeptical curiosity those parts which had
   been injured by the nails and the spear. All perceived the resemblance
   between the object in view and Jesus, but they could not be persuaded
   of the identity, so utterly unprepared were they for seeing the Dead
   One alive again; and their theory at first was just that of Strauss,
   that what they saw was a ghost or spectra. And the very fact that they
   entertained that theory makes it impossible for us to entertain it. We
   cannot, in the face of that fact, accept the Straussian dogma, that
   "the faith in Jesus as the Messiah, which by His violent death had
   received an apparently fatal shock, was subjectively restored by the
   instrumentality of the mind, the power of imagination and nervous
   excitement." The power of imagination and nervous excitement we know
   can do much. It has often happened to men in an abnormal, excited state
   to see projected into outward space the creations of a heated brain.
   but persons in a crazy state like that -- subject to hallucination --
   are not usually cool and rational enough to doubt the reality of what
   they see; nor is it necessary in their case to take pains to overcome
   such doubts. What they need rather, is to be made aware that what they
   think they see is not a reality: the very reverse of what Christ had to
   do for the disciples, and did, by solemn assertion that He was no
   spirit, by inviting them to handle Him, and so satisfy themselves of
   His material substantiality, and by partaking of food in their
   presence.

   When we keep steadily before our eyes the mental condition of the
   eleven at the time of Christ's resurrection, we see the transparent
   falsehood and absurdity of the theft theory invented by the Jewish
   priests. The disciples, according to this theory, came by night, while
   the guards were asleep, and stole the dead body of Jesus, that they
   might be able to circulate the belief that He was risen again. Matthew
   tells that even before the resurrection the murderers of our Lord were
   afraid this might be done; and then, to prevent any fraud of this kind,
   they applied to Pilate to have a guard put upon the grave, who
   accordingly contemptuously granted them permission to take what steps
   they pleased to prevent all resurrectionary proceedings on the part
   either of the dead or of the living, scornfully replying, "Ye have a
   watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can." This accordingly they
   did, sealing the stone and setting a watch. Alas! their precautions
   prevented neither the resurrection nor belief in it, but only supplied
   an illustration of the folly of those who attempt to manage providence,
   and to control the course of

   the world's history. They gave themselves much to do, and it all came
   to nothing. Not that we are disposed to deny the astuteness of these
   ecclesiastical politicians. Their scheme for preventing the
   resurrection was very prudent, and their mode of explaining it away
   after hand very plausible. The story they invented was really a very
   respectable fabrication, and was certain to satisfy all who wanted a
   decent theory to justify a foregone conclusion, as in fact it seems to
   have done; for, according to Matthew, it was commonly reported in after
   years. [654] It was not improbable that soldiers should fall asleep by
   night on the watch, especially when guarding a dead body, which was not
   likely to give them any trouble; and in the eyes of the unbelieving
   world, the followers of the Nazarene were capable of using any means
   for promoting their ends.

   But granting all this, and even granting that the Sanhedrists had been
   right in their opinion of the character of the disciples, their theft
   theory is ridiculous. The disciples, even if capable of such a theft,
   so far as scruples of conscience were concerned, were not in a state of
   mind to think of it, or to attempt it. They had not spirit left for
   such a daring action. Sorrow lay like a weight of lead on their hearts,
   and made them almost as inanimate as the corpse they are supposed to
   have stolen. Then the motive for the theft is one which could not have
   influenced them then. Steal the body to propagate a belief in the
   resurrection! What interest had they in propagating a belief which they
   did not entertain themselves? "As yet they knew not the Scriptures,
   that He must rise again from the dead;." [655] nor did they remember
   aught that their Master had said on this subject before His decease. To
   some this latter statement has appeared hard to believe; and to get
   over the difficulty, it has been suggested that the predictions of our
   Lord respecting His resurrection may not have been so definite as they
   appear in the Gospels, but may have assumed this definite form after
   the event, when their meaning was clearly understood. [656] We see no
   occasion for such a supposition. There can be no doubt that Jesus spoke
   plainly enough about His death at least; and yet His death, when it
   happened, took the disciples as much by surprise as did the
   resurrection. [657] One explanation suffices in both cases. The
   disciples were not clever, quick-witted, sentimental men such as Renan
   makes them. They were stupid, slow-minded persons; very honest, but
   very unapt to take in new ideas. They were like horses with blinders
   on, and could see only in one direction, -- that, namely, of their
   prejudices. It required the surgery of events to insert a new truth
   into their minds. Nothing would change the current of their thoughts
   but a damwork of undeniable fact. They could be convinced that Christ
   must die only by His dying, that He would rise only by His rising, that
   His kingdom was not to be of this world, only by the outpouring of the
   Spirit at Pentecost and the vocation of the Gentiles. Let us be
   thankful for the honest stupidity of these men. It gives great value to
   their testimony. We know that nothing but facts could make such men
   believe that which nowadays they get credit for inventing.

   The apologetic use which we have made of the doubts of the disciples
   concerning the resurrection of Christ is not only legitimate, but
   manifestly that which was intended by their being recorded. The
   evangelists have carefully chronicled these doubts that we might have
   no doubt. These things were written that we might believe that Jesus
   really did rise from the dead; for the apostles attached supreme
   importance to that fact, which they had doubted in the days of their
   disciple hood. It was the foundation of their doctrinal edifice, an
   essential part of their gospel. The Apostle Paul correctly summed up
   the gospel preached by the men who had been with Jesus, as well as by
   himself, in these three items: "that Christ died for our sins according
   to the Scriptures; and that He was buried; and that He rose again the
   third day, according to the Scriptures." All the eleven thoroughly
   agreed with Paul's sentiment, that if Christ were not risen, their
   preaching was vain, and the faith of Christians was also vain. There
   was no gospel at all, unless He who died for men's sins rose again for
   their justification. With this conviction in their minds, they
   constantly bore witness to the resurrection of Jesus wherever they
   went. So important a part of their work did this witness-bearing seem
   to them, that when Peter proposed the election of one to fill the place
   of Judas he singled it out as the characteristic function of the
   apostolic office. "Of these men," he said, "which have companied with
   us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, . . .
   must one become a witness with us of His resurrection."

   With this supreme value attached to the fact of Christ's rising again
   in apostolic preaching, it is our duty most heartily to sympathize.
   Modern unbelievers, like some in the Corinthian church, would persuade
   us that it does not matter whether Jesus rose or not, all that is
   valuable in Christianity being quite independent of mere historical
   truth. With these practically agree many believers addicted to an airy
   spiritualism, who treat mere supernatural facts with contemptuous
   neglect, deeming the high doctrines of the faith as alone worthy of
   their regard. To persons of this temper such studies as those which
   have occupied us in this chapter seem a mere waste of time; and if they
   spoke as they feel, they would say, "Let these trifles alone, and give
   us the pure and simple gospel." Intelligent, sober, and earnest
   Christians differ toto caelo from both these classes of people. In
   their view Christianity is in the first place a religion of
   supernatural facts. These facts occupy the principal place in their
   creed. They know that if these facts are honestly believed, all the
   great doctrines of the faith must sooner or later be accepted; and, on
   the other hand, they clearly understand that a religion which despises,
   not to say disbelieves, these facts, is but a cloudland which must soon
   be dissipated, or a house built on sand which the storm will sweep
   away. Therefore, while acknowledging the importance of all revealed
   truth, they lay very special stress on revealed facts. Believing with
   the heart the precious truth that Christ died for our sins, they are
   careful with the apostles to include in their gospel these items of
   fact, that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day. [658]

   [657] Colani (JÃ©sus Christ et les Croyances messianiques de son Temps,

   remark that the death of Jesus, being an unwelcome event, was a thing
   the disciples did not wish to remember or believe in, as involving the
   ruin of their Messianic hopes; whereas, the resurrection being a joyful
   event, would most gladly have been believed in had it really been
   preannounced. The author forgets that the resurrection implied death as
   its antecedent, and that if believed in, it would have made death
   appear in an altogether different light, and that if it failed to do
   that, it would beforehand share the same fate as the death, that, viz.,
   of being disregarded; and afterhand would seem "too good news to be
   true."

   [658] Baur, denying, or tacitly ignoring the fact of the resurrection,
   admits that the belief in it by the apostles was the necessary
   presupposition of the whole historical development of Christianity. How
   that belief arose in their minds he does not attempt to explain, but
   rather declares to be inexplicable by psychological analysis (vide
   Kirchen geschichte der Drei Ersten Jahrhunderte, 3te Ausg., p. 40).
   Keim's view is peculiar. Holding with Baur and Strauss the
   impossibility of a resurrection in the ordinary sense, he yet differs
   from Strauss in regarding the appearances of Jesus after His death as
   something more than hallucinations, as objective occurrences,
   "telegraphic" communications from the spirit-world to let the
   dispirited disciples know that all was well (Jesu von Nazara, Band iii.
   p. 605). This hypothesis, which seems to have been suggested by the
   phenomena of modern spiritualism, adds a fourth to the list of the
   naturalistic attempts to dispose of the great cardinal fact considered
   in this chapter. For the reader's benefit we may here give the list: --
   1. Jesus never was dead: resurrection was merely reanimation after a
   swoon. 2. The dead body was stolen, and the lie circulated that Jesus
   had risen. 3. The disciples honestly believed that Jesus had risen, but
   their belief was a pure hallucination bred by a heated brain. 4. Jesus
   after death made spiritualistic communications to His disciples, which
   naturally led to the belief that He was risen.

  SECTION II. THE EYES OF THE DISCIPLES OPENED

    Mark xvi. 14; Luke xxiv. 25-32; 44-46; John xx. 20-23.

   Jesus showed Himself alive after His passion to His disciples in a
   body, for the first time, on the evening of His resurrection day. It
   was the fourth time He had made Himself visible since He rose from the
   dead. He had appeared in the morning first of all to Mary of Magdala.
   She had earned the honor thus conferred on her by her pre-eminent
   devotion. Of kindred spirit with Mary of Bethany, she had been foremost
   among the women who came to Joseph's tomb to embalm the dead body of
   the Savior. Finding the grave empty, she wept bitter tears, because
   they had taken away her Lord, and she knew not where they had laid Him.
   Those tears, sure sign of deep true love, had not been unobserved of
   the Risen One. The sorrows of this faithful soul touched His tender
   heart, and brought Him to her side to comfort her. Turning round in
   distress from the sepulchre, she saw Him standing by, but knew Him not.
   "Jesus saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She,
   supposing Him to be the gardener, replies, Sir, if thou hast borne Him
   hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away.
   Jesus saith unto her, Mary." [659] Startled with the familiar voice,
   she looks more attentively, and forthwith returns the benignant
   salutation with an expressive word of recognition, "Rabboni." Thus "to
   holy tears, in lonely hours, Christ risen appears."

   The second appearance was vouchsafed to Peter. Concerning this private
   meeting between Jesus and His erring disciple we have no details: it is
   simply mentioned by Paul in his Epistle to the Corinthians, and by Luke
   in his Gospel; but we can have no doubt at all as to its object. The
   Risen Master remembered Peter's sin; He knew how troubled he was in
   mind on account of it; He desired without delay to let him know he was
   forgiven; and out of delicate consideration for the offender's feelings
   He contrived to meet him for the first time after his fall, alone.

   In the course of the day Jesus appeared, for the third time, to the two
   brethren who journeyed to Emmaus. Luke has given greater prominence to
   this third appearance than to any other in his narrative, probably
   because it was one of the most interesting of the anecdotes concerning
   the resurrection which he found in the collections out of which he
   compiled his Gospel. And, in truth, any thing more interesting than
   this beautiful story cannot well be imagined. How vividly is the whole
   situation of the disciples brought before us by the picture of the two
   friends walking along the way, and talking together of the things which
   had happened, the sufferings of Jesus three days ago, and the rumors
   just come to their ears concerning His resurrection; and as they
   talked, vibrating between despair and hope, now brooding disconsolately
   on the crucifixion of Him whom till then they had regarded as the
   Redeemer of Israel, anon wondering if it were possible that He could
   have risen again! Then how unspeakably pathetic the behavior of Jesus
   throughout this scene! By an artifice of love He assumes the incognito,
   and, joining the company of the two sorrowful men, asks them in a
   careless way what is the subject about which they are talking so sadly
   and seriously; and on receiving for reply a question expressive of
   surprise that even a stranger in Jerusalem should not know the things
   which have come to pass, again asks dryly and indifferently, "What
   things?" Having thereby drawn out of them their story, He proceeds in
   turn to show them that an intelligent reader of the Old Testament ought
   not to be surprised at such things happening to one whom they believed
   to be Christ, taking occasion to expound unto them "in all the
   Scriptures the things concerning Himself," without saying that it is of
   Himself He speaks. On the arrival of the travellers at the village
   whither the two brethren were bound, the unknown One assumes the air of
   a man who is going farther on, as it would not become a stranger to
   thrust himself into company uninvited; but receiving a pressing
   invitation, He accepts it, and at last the two brethren discover to
   their joy whom they have been entertaining unawares.

   This appearing of Jesus to the two brethren by the way was a sort of
   prelude to that which He made on the evening of the same day in
   Jerusalem to the eleven, or rather the ten. As soon as they had
   discovered whom they had had for a guest, Cleopas and his companion set
   out from Emmaus to the Holy City, eager to tell the friends there the
   stirring news. And, behold, while they are in the very act of telling
   what things were done in the way, and how Jesus became known to them in
   the breaking of bread, Jesus Himself appeared in the midst of them,
   uttering the kindly salutation, "Peace be unto you!" He is come to do
   for the future apostles what He has already done for the two friends:
   to show Himself alive to them after His passion, and to open their
   understandings that they might understand the Scriptures, and see that,
   according to what had been written before of the Christ, it behooved
   Him to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day.

   While the general design of the two appearances is the same, we observe
   a difference in the order of procedure followed by Jesus. In the one
   case He opened the eyes of the understanding first, and the eyes of the
   body second; in the other, He reversed this order. In His colloquy with
   the two brethren He first showed them that the crucifixion and the
   rumored resurrection were in perfect accordance with Old Testament
   Scriptures, and then at the close made Himself visible to their bodily
   eyes as Jesus risen. In other words, He first taught them the true
   scriptural theory of Messiah's earthly experience, and then He
   satisfied them as to the matter of fact. In the meeting at night with
   the ten, on the other hand, he disposed of the matter of fact first,
   and then took up the theory afterwards. He convinced His disciples, by
   showing them His hands and His feet, and by eating food, that He really
   was risen; and then He proceeded to show that the fact was only what
   they ought to have expected as the fulfilment of Old Testament
   prophecy.

   In thus varying the order of revelation, Jesus was but adapting His
   procedure to the different circumstances of the persons with whom He
   had to deal. The two friends who journeyed to Emmaus did not notice any
   resemblance between the stranger who joined their company and their
   beloved Lord, of whom they had been thinking and speaking. "Their eyes
   were holden, that they should not know Him." [660] The main cause of
   this, we believe, was sheer heaviness of heart. Sorrow made them
   unobserving. They were so engrossed with their own sad thoughts that
   they had no eyes for outward things. They did not take the trouble to
   look who it was that had come up with them; it would have made no
   difference though the stranger had been their own father. It is obvious
   how men in such a mood must be dealt with. They can get outward vision
   only by getting the inward eye first opened. The diseased mind must be
   healed, that they may be able to look at what is before them, and see
   it as it is. On this principle Jesus proceeded with the two brethren.
   He accommodated Himself to their humor, and led them on from despair to
   hope, and then the outward senses recovered their perceptive power, and
   told who the stranger was. "You have heard," He said in effect, "a
   rumor that He who was crucified three days ago is risen. You regarded
   this rumor as an incredible story. But why should you? You believe
   Jesus to be the Christ. If He was the Christ, His rising again was to
   be expected as much as the passion, for both alike are foretold in the
   Scriptures which ye believe to be the Word of God." These thoughts
   having taken hold of their minds, the hearts of the two brethren begin
   to burn with the kindling power of a new truth; the day-dawn of hope
   breaks on their spirit; they waken up as from an oppressive dream; they
   look outward, and, lo, the man who has been discoursing to them is
   Jesus Himself!

   With the ten the case was different. When Jesus appeared in the midst
   of them, they were struck at once with the resemblance to their
   deceased Master. They had been listening to the story of Cleopas and
   his companion, and were in a more observing mood. But they could not
   believe that what they saw really was Jesus. They were terrified and
   affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit -- the ghost or
   spectre of the Crucified. The first thing to be done in this case,
   therefore, manifestly was to allay the fear awakened, and to convince
   the terrified disciples that the being who had suddenly appeared was no
   ghost, but a man: the very man He seemed to be, even Jesus Himself. Not
   till that has been done can any discourse be profitably held concerning
   the teaching of the Old Testament on the subject of Messiah's earthly
   history. To that task accordingly Jesus forthwith addressed Himself,
   and only when it was successfully accomplished did He proceed to
   expound the true Messianic theory.

   Something analogous to the difference we have pointed out in the
   experience of the two and the ten disciples in connection with belief
   in the resurrection may be found in the ways by which different
   Christians now are brought to faith. The evidences of Christianity are
   commonly divided into two great categories -- the external and the
   internal; the one drawn from outward historical facts, the other from
   the adaptation of the gospel to man's nature and needs. Both sorts of
   evidence are necessary to a perfect faith, just as both sorts of
   vision, the outward and the inward, were necessary to make the
   disciples thorough believers in the fact of the resurrection. But some
   begin with the one, some with the other. Some are convinced first that
   the gospel story is true, and then perhaps long after waken up to a
   sense of the importance and preciousness of the things which it
   relates. Others, again, are like Cleopas and his companion; so
   engrossed with their own thoughts as to be incapable of appreciating or
   seeing facts, requiring first to have the eyes of their understanding
   enlightened to see the beauty and the worthiness of the truth as it is
   in Jesus. They may at one time have had a kind of traditional faith in
   the facts as sufficiently well attested. But they have lost that faith,
   it may be not without regret. They are skeptics, and yet they are sad
   because they are so, and feel that it was better with them when, like
   others, they believed. Yet, though they attempt it, they cannot restore
   their faith by a study of mere external evidences. They read books
   dealing in such evidences, but they are not much impressed by them.
   Their eyes are holden, and they know not Christ coming to them in that
   outward way. But He reveals Himself to them in another manner. By
   hidden discourse with their spirits He conveys into their minds a
   powerful sense of the moral grandeur of the Christian faith, making
   them feel that, true or not, it is at least worthy to be true. Then
   their hearts begin to burn: they hope that what is so beautiful may
   turn out to be objectively true; the question of the external evidences
   assumes a new interest to their minds; they inquire, they read, they
   look; and, lo, they see Jesus revived, a true historical person for
   them: risen out of the grave of doubt to live for evermore the sun of
   their souls, more precious for the temporary loss; coming


   "Apparelled in more precious habit,

   More moving, delicate, and full of life,

   Into the eye and prospect of their soul,"

   than ever He did before they doubted.

   From these remarks on the order of the two revelations made by Jesus to
   His disciples, -- of Himself to the eye of their body, and of the
   scriptural doctrine of the Messiah to the eye of their mind, -- we pass
   to consider the question, What did the latter revelation amount to?
   What was the precise effect of those expositions of Scripture with
   which the risen Christ favored His hearers? Did the disciples derive
   therefrom such an amount of light as to supersede the necessity of any
   further illumination? Had Jesus Himself done the work of the Spirit of
   Truth, whose advent He had promised before He suffered, and led them
   into all truth? Certainly not. The opening of the understanding which
   took place at this time did not by any means amount to a full spiritual
   enlightenment in Christian doctrine. The disciples did not yet
   comprehend the moral grounds of Christ's sufferings and resurrection.
   Why He underwent these experiences they knew not; the words "ought" and
   "behooved" meant for them as yet nothing more than that, according to
   Old Testament prophecies rightly understood, the things which had
   happened might and should have been anticipated. They were in the same
   state of mind as that in which we can conceive the Jewish Christians to
   whom the Epistle to the Hebrews was addressed to have been after
   perusing the contents of that profound writing. These Christians were
   ill grounded in gospel truth: they saw not the glory of the gospel
   dispensation, nor its harmony with that which went before, and under
   which they had been themselves educated. In particular, the divine
   dignity of the Author of the Christian faith seemed to them
   incompatible with His earthly humiliation. Accordingly, the writer of
   the epistle set himself to prove that the divinity, the temporary
   humiliation, and the subsequent glorification of the Christ were all
   taught in the Old Testament Scriptures, quoting these liberally for
   that purpose in the early chapters of his epistle. He did, in fact, by
   his written expositions for his readers, what Jesus did by His oral
   expositions for His hearers. And what shall we say was the immediate
   effect of the writer's argument on the minds of those who attentively
   perused it? This, we imagine, that the crude believer on laying down
   the book would be constrained to admit: "Well, he is right: these
   things are all written in the Scriptures of the Messiah; and therefore
   no one of them, not even the humiliation and suffering at which I
   stumble, can be a reason for rejecting Jesus as the Christ." A very
   important result, yet a very elementary one. From the bare concession
   that the real life of Jesus corresponded to the ideal life of the
   Messiah as portrayed in the Old Testament, to the admiring,
   enthusiastic, and thoroughly intelligent appreciation of gospel truth
   exhibited by the writer himself in every page of his epistle, what a
   vast distance!

   Not less was the distance between the state of mind of the disciples
   after Jesus had expounded to them the things in the law, and the
   prophets, and the psalms concerning Himself, and the state of
   enlightenment to which they attained as apostles after the advent of
   the Comforter. Now they knew the alphabet merely of the doctrine of
   Christ; then they had arrived at perfection, and were thoroughly
   initiated into the mystery of the gospel. Now a single ray of light was
   let into their dark minds; then the daylight of truth poured its full
   flood into their souls. Or we may express the difference in terms
   suggested by the narrative given by John of the events connected with
   this first appearance of the risen Jesus to His disciples. John
   relates, that, at a certain stage in the proceedings, Jesus breathed on
   the disciples, and said unto them, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." We are
   not to understand that they then and there received the Spirit in the
   promised fulness. The breath was rather but a sign and earnest of what
   was to come. It was but an emblematic renewal of the promise, and a
   first installment of its fulfilment. It was but the little cloud like a
   man's hand that portended a plenteous rain, or the first gentle puff of
   wind which precedes the mighty gale. Now they have the little breath of
   the Spirit's influence, but not till Pentecost shall they feel the
   rushing wind. So great is the difference between now and then: between
   the spiritual enlightenment of the disciples on the first Christian
   Sabbath evening, and that of the apostles in after days.

   It was but the day of small things with these disciples yet. The small
   things, however, were not to be despised; nor were they. What value the
   ten set on the light they had received we are not indeed told, but we
   may safely assume that their feelings were much of kin to those of the
   two brethren who journeyed towards Emmaus. Conversing together on the
   discourse of Jesus after His departure, they said one unto another,
   "Did not our heart burn within us while He talked with us by the way,
   and while He opened to us the Scriptures?" The light they had got might
   be small, but it was new light, and it had all the heart-kindling,
   thought-stirring power of new truth. That conversation on the road
   formed a crisis in their spiritual history. It was the dawn of the
   gospel day; it was the little spark which kindles a great fire; it
   deposited in their minds a thought which was to form the germ or centre
   of a new system of belief; it took away the veil which had been upon
   their faces in the reading of the Old Testament, and was thus the first
   step in a process which was to issue in their beholding with open face,
   as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, and in their being changed into
   the same image, from glory to glory, by the Lord the Spirit. Happy the
   man who has got even so far as these two disciples at this time!

   Some disconsolate soul may say, Would that happiness were mine! For the
   comfort of such a forlorn brother, let us note the circumstances in
   which this new light arose for the disciples. Their hearts were set
   a-burning when they had become very dry and withered: hopeless, sick,
   and life-weary, through sorrow and disappointment. It is always so: the
   fuel must be dry that the spark may take hold. It was when the people
   of Israel complained, "Our bones are dried and our hope is lost, we are
   cut off for our parts," that the word went forth: "Behold, O my people,
   I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves,
   and bring you into the land of Israel." So with these disciples of
   Jesus. It was when every particle of the sap of hope had been bleached
   out of them, and their faith had been reduced to this, "We trusted that
   it had been He which should have redeemed Israel," that their hearts
   were set burning by the kindling power of a new truth. So it has been
   in many an instance since then. The fire of hope has been kindled in
   the heart, never to be extinguished, just at the moment when men were
   settling down into despair; faith has been revived when a man seemed to
   himself to be an infidel; the light of truth has arisen to minds which
   had ceased to look for the dawn; the comfort of salvation has returned
   to souls which had begun to think that God's mercy was clean gone for
   ever. "When the Son of man cometh shall He find faith on the earth?"

   There is nothing strange in this. The truth is, the heart needs to be
   dried by trial before it can be made to burn. Till sorrow comes, human
   hearts do not catch the divine fire; there is too much of this world's
   life-sap in them. That was what made the disciples so slow of heart to
   believe all that the prophets had spoken. Their worldly ambition
   prevented them from learning the spirituality of Christ's kingdom, and
   pride made them blind to the glory of the cross. Hence Jesus justly
   upbraided them for their unbelief and their mindless stupidity. Had
   their hearts been pure, they might have known beforehand what was to
   happen. As it was, they comprehended nothing till their Lord's death
   had blighted their hope and blasted their ambition, and bitter sorrow
   had prepared them for receiving spiritual instruction.

  SECTION III. THE DOUBT OF THOMAS

    John xx. 24-29.

   "Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when
   Jesus came" on that first Christian Sabbath evening, and showed Himself
   to His disciples. One hopes he had a good reason for his absence; but
   it is at least possible that he had not. In his melancholy humor he may
   simply have been indulging himself in the luxury of solitary sadness,
   just as some whose Christ is dead do now spend their Sabbaths at home
   or in rural solitudes, shunning the offensive cheerfulness or the
   drowsy dullness of social worship. Be that as it may, in any case he
   missed a good sermon; the only one, so far as we know, in the whole
   course of our Lord's ministry, in which He addressed Himself formally
   to the task of expounding the Messianic doctrine of the Old Testament.
   Had he but known that such a discourse was to be delivered that night!
   But one never knows when the good things will come, and the only way to
   make sure of getting them is to be always at our post.

   The same melancholy humor which probably caused Thomas to be an
   absentee on the occasion of Christ's first meeting with His disciples
   after He rose from the dead, made him also skeptical above all the rest
   concerning the tidings of the resurrection. When the other disciples
   told him on his return that they had just seen the Lord, he replied
   with vehemence: "Except I shall see in His hands the print of the
   nails, and put my fingers into the print of the nails, and put my hand
   into His side, I will not believe." [661] He was not to be satisfied
   with the testimony of his brethren: he must have palpable evidence for
   himself. Not that he doubted their veracity; but he could not get rid
   of the suspicion that what they said they had seen was but a mere
   ghostly appearance by which their eyes had been deceived.

   The skepticism of Thomas was, we think, mainly a matter of temperament,
   and had little in common with the doubt of men of rationalistic
   proclivities, who are inveterately incredulous respecting the
   supernatural, and stumble at every thing savoring of the miraculous. It
   has been customary to call Thomas the Rationalist among the twelve, and
   it has even been supposed that he had belonged to the sect of the
   Sadducees before he joined the society of Jesus. On mature
   consideration, we are constrained to say that we see very little
   foundation for such a view of this disciple's character, while we
   certainly do not grudge modern doubters any comfort they may derive
   from it. We are quite well aware that among the sincere, and even the
   spiritually-minded, there are men whose minds are so constituted that
   they find it very difficult to believe in the supernatural and the
   miraculous: so difficult, that it is a question whether, if they had
   been in Thomas's place, the freest handling and the minutest inspection
   of the wounds in the risen Saviour's body would have availed to draw
   forth from them an expression of unhesitating faith in the reality of
   His resurrection. Nor do we see any reason Ã  priori for asserting that
   no disciple of Jesus could have been a person of such a cast of mind.
   All we say is, there is no evidence that Thomas, as a matter of fact,
   was a man of this stamp. Nowhere in the Gospel history do we discover
   any unreadiness on his part to believe in the supernatural or the
   miraculous as such. We do not find, e.g. that he was skeptical about
   the raising of Lazarus: we are only told that, when Jesus proposed to
   visit the afflicted family in Bethany, he regarded the journey as
   fraught with danger to his beloved Master and to them all, and said,
   "Let us also go, that we may die with Him." Then, as now, he showed
   Himself not so much the Rationalist as the man of gloomy temperament,
   prone to look upon the dark side of things, living in the pensive
   moonlight rather than in the cheerful sunlight. His doubt did not
   spring out of his system of thought, but out of the state of his
   feelings.

   Another thing we must say here concerning the doubt of this disciple.
   It did not proceed from unwillingness to believe. It was the doubt of a
   sad man, whose sadness was due to this, that the event whereof he
   doubted was one of which he would most gladly be assured. Nothing could
   give Thomas greater delight than to be certified that his Master was
   indeed risen. This is evident from the joy he manifested when he was at
   length satisfied. "My Lord and my God!" that is not the exclamation of
   one who is forced reluctantly to admit a fact he would rather deny. It
   is common for men who never had any doubts themselves to trace all
   doubt to bad motives, and denounce it indiscriminately as a crime. Now,
   unquestionably, too many doubt from bad motives, because they do not
   wish and cannot afford to believe. Many deny the resurrection of the
   dead, because it would be to them a resurrection to shame and
   everlasting contempt. But this is by no means true of all. Some doubt
   who desire to believe; nay, their doubt is due to their excessive
   anxiety to believe. They are so eager to know the very truth, and feel
   so keenly the immense importance of the interests at stake, that they
   cannot take things for granted, and for a time their hand so trembles
   that they cannot seize firm hold of the great objects of faith -- a
   living God; an incarnate, crucified, risen Saviour; a glorious eternal
   future. Theirs is the doubt peculiar to earnest, thoughtful,
   pure-hearted men, wide as the poles asunder from the doubt of the
   frivolous, the worldly, the vicious: a holy, noble doubt, not a base
   and unholy; if not to be praised as positively meritorious, still less
   to be harshly condemned and excluded from the pale of Christian
   sympathy -- a doubt which at worst is but an infirmity, and which ever
   ends in strong, unwavering faith.

   That Jesus regarding the doubt of the heavy-hearted disciple as of this
   sort, we infer from His way of dealing with it. Thomas having been
   absent on the occasion of His first appearing to the disciples, the
   risen Lord makes a second appearance for the absent one's special
   benefit, and offers him the proof desiderated. The introductory
   salutation being over, He turns Himself at once to the doubter, and
   addresses him in terms fitted to remind him of his own statement to his
   brethren, saying: "Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and
   reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not
   faithless, but believing." There may be somewhat of reproach here, but
   there is far more of most considerate sympathy. Jesus speaks as to a
   sincere disciple, whose faith is weak, not as to one who hath an evil
   heart of unbelief. When demands for evidence were made by men who
   merely wanted an excuse for unbelief, He met them in a very different
   manner. "A wicked and adulterous generation," He was wont to say in
   such a case, "seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign be given
   unto it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas."

   Having ascertained the character of Thomas's doubt, let us now look at
   his faith.

   The melancholy disciple's doubts were soon removed. But how? Did Thomas
   avail himself of the offered facilities for ascertaining the reality of
   his Lord's resurrection? Did he actually put his fingers and hand into
   the nail and spear wounds? Opinions differ on this point, but we think
   the probability is on the side of those who maintain the negative.
   Several things incline us to this view. First, the narrative seems to
   leave no room for the process of investigation. Thomas answers the
   proposal of Jesus by what appears to be an immediate profession of
   faith. Then the form in which that profession is made is not such as we
   should expect the result of a deliberate inquiry to assume. "My Lord
   and my God!" is the warm, passionate language of a man who has
   undergone some sudden change of feeling, rather than of one who has
   just concluded a scientific experiment. Further, we observe there is no
   allusion to such a process in the remark made by Jesus concerning the
   faith of Thomas. The disciple is represented as believing because he
   has seen the wounds shown, not because he has handled them. Finally,
   the idea of the process proposed being actually gone through is
   inconsistent with the character of the man to whom the proposal was
   made. Thomas was not one of your calm, cold-blooded men, who conduct
   inquiries into truth with the passionless impartiality of a judge, and
   who would have examined the wounds in the risen Saviour's body with all
   the coolness with which anatomists dissect dead carcasses. He was a man
   of passionate, poetic temperament, vehement alike in his belief and in
   his unbelief, and moved to faith or doubt by the feelings of his heart
   rather than by the reasonings of his intellect.

   The truth, we imagine, about Thomas was something like this. When,
   eight days before, he made that threat to his brother disciples, he did
   not deliberately mean all he said. It was the whimsical utterance of a
   melancholy man, who was in the humor to be as disconsolate and
   miserable as possible. "Jesus risen! the thing is impossible, and
   there's an end of it. I won't believe except I do so and so. I don't
   know if I shall believe when all's done." But eight days have gone by,
   and, lo, there is Jesus in the midst of them, visible to the disciple
   who was absent on the former occasion as well as to the rest. Will
   Thomas still insist on applying his rigorous test? No, no! His doubts
   vanish at the very sight of Jesus, like morning mists at sunrise. Even
   before the Risen One has laid bare His wounds, and uttered those
   half-reproachful, yet kind, sympathetic words, which evince intimate
   knowledge of all that has been passing through His doubting disciple's
   mind, Thomas is virtually a believer; and after he has seen the ugly
   wounds and heard the generous words, he is ashamed of his rash,
   reckless speech to his brethren, and, overcome with joy and with tears,
   exclaims, "My Lord and my God!"

   It was a noble confession of faith, -- the most advanced, in fact, ever
   made by any of the twelve during the time they were with Jesus. The
   last is first; the greatest doubter attains to the fullest and firmest
   belief. So has it often happened in the history of the Church. Baxter
   records it as his experience, that nothing is so firmly believed as
   that which hath once been doubted. Many Thomases have said, or could
   say, the same thing of themselves. The doubters have eventually become
   the soundest and even the warmest believers. Doubt in itself is a cold
   thing, and, as in the case of Thomas, it often utters harsh and
   heartless sayings. Nor need this surprise us; for when the mind is in
   doubt the soul is in darkness, and during the chilly night the heart
   becomes frozen. But when the daylight of faith comes, the frost melts,
   and hearts which once seemed hard and stony show themselves capable of
   generous enthusiasm and ardent devotion.

   Socinians, whose system is utterly overthrown by Thomas's confession
   naturally interpreted, tell us that the words "My Lord and my God" do
   not refer to Jesus at all, but to the Deity in heaven. They are merely
   an expression of astonishment on the part of the disciple, on finding
   that what he had doubted was really come to pass. He lifts up his eyes
   and his hands to heaven, as it were, and exclaims, My Lord and my God!
   it is a fact: The crucified Jesus is restored to life again. This
   interpretation is utterly desperate. It disregards the statement of the
   text, that Thomas, in uttering these words, was answering and speaking
   to Jesus, and it makes a man bursting with emotion speak frigidly; for
   while the one expression "My God" might have been an appropriate
   utterance of astonishment, the two phrases, "My Lord and my God," are
   for that purpose weak and unnatural.

   We have here, therefore, no mere expression of surprise, but a
   profession of faith most appropriate to the man and the circumstances;
   as pregnant with meaning as it is pithy and forcible. Thomas declares
   at once his acceptance of a miraculous fact, and his belief in a
   momentous doctrine. In the first part of his address to Jesus he
   recognizes that He who was dead is alive: My Lord, my beloved Master!
   it is even He, -- the very same person with whom we enjoyed such
   blessed fellowship before He was crucified. In the second part of his
   address he acknowledges Christ's divinity, if not for the first time,
   at least with an intelligence and an emphasis altogether new. From the
   fact he rises to the doctrine: My Lord risen, yea, and therefore my
   God; for He is divine over whom death hath no power. And the doctrine
   in turn helps to give to the fact of the resurrection additional
   certainty; for if Christ be God, death could have no power over Him,
   and His resurrection was a matter of course. Thomas having reached the
   sublime affirmation, "My God," has made the transition from the low
   platform of faith on which he stood when he demanded sensible evidence,
   to the higher, on which it is felt that such evidence is superfluous.

   We have now to notice, in the last place, the remark made by the Lord
   concerning the faith just professed by His disciple. "Jesus saith unto
   him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are
   they that have not seen, and yet have believed."

   This reflection on the blessedness of those who believe without seeing,
   though expressed in the past tense, really concerned the future. The
   case supposed by Jesus was to be the case of all believers after the
   apostolic age. Since then no one has seen, and no one can believe
   because he has seen, as the apostles saw. They saw, that we might be
   able to do without seeing, believing on their testimony.

   But what does Jesus mean by pronouncing a beatitude on those who see
   not, yet believe?

   He does not mean to commend those who believe without any inquiry. It
   is one thing to believe without seeing, another thing to believe
   without consideration. To believe without seeing is to be capable of
   being satisfied with something less than absolute demonstration, or to
   have such an inward illumination as renders us to a certain extent
   independent of external evidence. Such a faculty of faith is most
   needful; for if faith were possible only to those who see, belief in
   Christianity could not extend beyond the apostolic age. But to believe
   without consideration is a different matter altogether. It is simply
   not to care whether the thing believed be true or false. There is no
   merit in doing that. Such faith has its origin in what is base in men,
   -- in their ignorance, sloth, and spiritual indifference; and it can
   bring no blessing to its possessors. Be the truths credited ever so
   high, holy, blessed, what good can a faith do which receives them as
   matters of course without inquiry, or without even so much as knowing
   what the truths believed mean?

   The Lord Jesus, then, does not here bestow a benediction on credulity.

   As little does He mean to say that all the felicity falls to the lot of
   those who have never, like Thomas, doubted. The fact is not so. Those
   who believe with facility do certainly enjoy a blessedness all their
   own. They escape the torment of uncertainty, and the current of their
   spiritual life flows on very smoothly. But the men who have doubted,
   and now at length believe, have also their peculiar joys, with which no
   stranger can intermeddle. Theirs is the joy experienced when that which
   was dead is alive again, and that which was lost is found. Theirs is
   the rapture of Thomas when he exclaimed, with reference to a Saviour
   thought to be gone for ever, "My Lord and my God." Theirs is the bliss
   of the man who, having dived into a deep sea, brings up a pearl of very
   great price. Theirs is the comfort of having their very bygone doubts
   made available for the furtherance of their faith, every doubt becoming
   a stone in the hidden foundation on which the superstructure of their
   creed is built, the perturbations of faith being converted into
   confirmations, just as the perturbations in the planetary motions, at
   first supposed to throw doubt on Newton's theory of gravitation, were
   converted by more searching inquiry into the strongest proof of its
   truth.

   What, then, does the Lord Jesus mean by these words? Simply this: He
   would have those who must believe without seeing, understand that they
   have no cause to envy those who had an opportunity of seeing, and who
   believed only after they saw. We who live so far from the events, are
   very apt to imagine that we are placed at a great disadvantage as
   compared with the disciples of Jesus. So in some respects we are, and
   especially in this, that faith is more difficult for us than for them.
   But then we must not forget that, in proportion as faith is difficult,
   it is meritorious, and precious to the heart. It is a higher attainment
   to be able to believe without seeing, than to believe because we have
   seen; and if it cost an effort, the trial of faith but enhances its
   value. We must remember, further, that we never reach the full
   blessedness of faith till what we believe shines in the light of its
   own self-evidence. Think you the disciples were happy men because they
   had seen their risen Lord and believed? They were far happier when they
   had attained to such clear insight into the whole mystery of
   redemption, that proof of this or that particular fact or doctrine was
   felt to be quite unnecessary.

   To that felicity Jesus wished His doubting disciple to aspire; and by
   contrasting his case with that of those who believe without seeing, He
   gives us to know that it is attainable for us also. We, too, may attain
   the blessedness of a faith raised above all doubt by its own clear
   insight into divine truth. If we are faithful, we may rise to this from
   very humble things. We may begin, in our weakness, with being Thomases,
   clinging eagerly to every spar of external evidence to save ourselves
   from drowning, and end with a faith amounting almost to sight,
   rejoicing in Jesus as our Lord and God, with a joy unspeakable and full
   of glory.

29. THE UNDER-SHEPHERDS ADMONISHED
     __________________________________________________________________

  SECTION I. PASTORAL DUTY

    John 21:15-17.

   "I go a-fishing," said Simon to his companions, some time after they
   and he had returned from Jerusalem to the neighborhood of the Galilean
   lake. "We also go with thee," replied Thomas and Nathanael, and James
   and John, and two others unnamed, making with Peter seven, probably all
   of the eleven who were fishermen by trade. One and all went on that
   fishing expedition con amore. It was an expedition, we presume, in the
   first place, in quest of food, but it was something more. It was a
   return to dear old ways, amid familiar scenes, which called up pleasing
   reminiscences of bygone times. It was a recreation and a solace, most
   welcome and most needful to men who had passed through very painful and
   exciting experiences; a holiday for men fatigued by sorrow, and
   surprise, and watching. Every student with overtasked brain, every
   artisan with over strained sinews, can conceive the abandon with which
   those seven disciples threw themselves into their boats, and sailed out
   into the depths of the Sea of Tiberias to ply their old craft.

   Out on the waters that night, what were these men's thoughts? From the
   significant allusion made by Jesus to Peter's youth in the colloquy of
   next morning, we infer they were something like the following: --
   "After all, were it not better to be simple fishermen than to be
   apostles of the Christian religion? What have we got by following
   Jesus? Certainly not what we expected. And have we any reason to expect
   better things in the future? Our Master has told us that our future lot
   will be very much like His own, -- a life of sorrow, ending probably in
   martyrdom. But here, in our native province of Galilee, pursuing our
   old calling, we might think, believe, act as we pleased, shielded by
   obscurity from all danger. Then how delightfully free and independent
   this rustic life by the shores of the lake! In former days, ere we left
   our nets and followed Jesus, we girded ourselves with our fishermen's
   coats, and walked whither we would. When we shall have become apostles,
   all that will be at an end. We shall be burdened with a heavy load of
   responsibility; obliged continually to think of others, and not to
   please ourselves; liable to have our personal liberty taken away, yea,
   even our very life."

   In putting such words into the mouths of the disciples, we do not
   violate probability; for such feelings as the words express are both
   natural and common in view of grave responsibilities and perils about
   to be incurred. Perhaps no one ever put his hand to the plough of an
   arduous enterprise, without indulging for at least a brief space in
   such a looking back. It is an infirmity which easily besets human
   nature.

   Yet, natural as it comes to men to look back, it is not wise. Regretful
   thoughts of the past are for the most part delusive; they were so,
   certainly, in the case of the disciples. If the simple life they left
   behind them was so very happy, why did they leave it? Why so prompt to
   forsake their nets and their boats, and to follow after Jesus? Ah!
   fishing in the blue waters of the Sea of Galilee did not satisfy the
   whole man. Life is more than meat, and the kingdom of God is man's
   chief end. Besides, the fisherman's life has its drawbacks, and is by
   no means so romantic as it seems at the distance of years. You may
   sometimes go out with your nets, and toil all night, and catch nothing.

   This was what actually happened on the present occasion. "That night
   they caught nothing." [662] The circumstance probably helped to break
   the spell of romance, and to waken the seven disciples out of a fond
   dream. Be that as it may, there was One who knew all their thoughts,
   and who would see to it that they did not indulge long in the luxury of
   reactionary feeling. "When the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the
   shore." [663] He is come to show Himself for the third time [664] to
   His disciples, -- not, as before, to convince them that He is risen,
   but to induce them to dedicate their whole minds and hearts to their
   future vocation as fishers of men, and as under-shepherds of the flock,
   preparatory to His own departure from the world. His whole conduct on
   this occasion is directed to that object. First, He gives them
   directions for catching a great haul of fish, to remind them of their
   former call to be His apostles, and to be an encouraging sign or symbol
   of their success in their apostolic work. Then He invites them to dine
   on fish which He had procured, [665] roasted on a fire of His own
   kindling on the shore, to cure them of earthly care, and to assure them
   that if they seek to serve the kingdom with undivided heart, all their
   wants will be attended to. Finally, when the morning meal is over, He
   enters into conversation, in the hearing of all, with the disciple who
   had been the leader in the night adventure on the lake, and addresses
   him in a style fitted to call forth all his latent enthusiasm, and
   intended to have a similar effect on the minds of all present.

   On the surface, the words spoken by Jesus to Peter seem to concern that
   disciple alone; and the object aimed at appears to be to restore him to
   a position as an apostle, which he might not unnaturally think he had
   forfeited by his conduct in the high priest's palace. This,
   accordingly, is the view commonly taken of this impressive scene on the
   shore of the lake. And whether we agree with that view or not, we must
   admit that, for some reason or other, the Lord Jesus wished to recall
   to Peter's remembrance his recent shortcomings. Traces of allusion to
   past incidents in the disciple's history during the late crisis are
   unmistakable. Even the time selected for the conversation is
   significant. It was when they had dined that Jesus asked Peter if he
   loved Him; it was after they had supped Jesus gave His disciples His
   new commandment of love, and that Peter made his vehement protestation
   of devotion to his Master's cause and person. The name by which the
   risen Lord addressed His disciple -- not Peter, but Simon son of Jonas
   -- was fitted to remind him of his weakness, and of that other occasion
   on which, calling him by the same name, Jesus warned him that Satan was
   about to sift him as wheat. The thrice-repeated question, "Lovest thou
   me?" could not fail painfully to remind Peter of his threefold denial,
   and so to renew his grief. The form in which the question was first put
   -- "Lovest thou me more than these?" -- contains a manifest allusion to
   Peter's declaration, "Though all shall be offended because of Thee, yet
   will I never be offended." The injunction, "Feed my sheep," points back
   to the prophetic announcement made by Jesus on the way to the Mount of
   Olives, "All ye shall be offended because of me this night; for it is
   written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be
   scattered abroad," and means, Suffer not the sheep to be scattered, as
   ye were for a season scattered yourselves. The injunction, "Feed my
   lambs," associated with the first question, "Lovest thou me more than
   these?" makes us think of the charge, "When thou art converted,
   strengthen thy brethren;." the idea suggested in both cases being the
   same, viz. that the man who has fallen most deeply, and learned most
   thoroughly his own weakness, is, or ought to be, best qualified for
   strengthening the weak, -- for feeding the lambs.

   Notwithstanding all these allusions to Peter's fall, we are unable to
   acquiesce in the view that the scene here recorded signified the formal
   restoration of the erring disciple to his position as an apostle. We do
   not deny that, after what had taken place, that disciple needed
   restoration for his own comfort and peace of mind. But our difficulty
   is this: Had he not been restored already? What was the meaning of that
   private meeting between him and Jesus, and what its necessary result?
   Who can doubt that after that meeting the disciple's mind was at ease,
   and that thereafter he was at peace, both with himself and with his
   Master? Or if evidence is wanted of the fact, look at Peter's behavior
   on recognizing Jesus from the boat, as He stood on the shore in the
   gray morning, casting himself as he was into the sea, in his haste to
   get near his beloved Lord. Was that the behavior of a man afflicted
   with a guilty conscience? But it may be replied, There was still need
   for a formal public restoration, the scandal caused by Peter's sin
   being public. This we doubt; but even granting it, what then? Why did
   the restoration not take place sooner, at the first or second meeting
   in Jerusalem? Then, does the scene by the shores of the lake really
   look like a formal transaction? Can we regard that casual, easy,
   familiar meeting and colloquy after breakfast with two-thirds of the
   disciples as an ecclesiastical diet, for the solemn purpose of
   restoring a fallen brother to church fellowship and standing? The idea
   is too frigid and pedantic to be seriously entertained. Then one more
   objection to this theory remains to be stated, viz. that it fails to
   give unity to the various parts of the scene. It may explain the
   questioning to which Jesus subjected Peter, but it does not explain the
   prophetic reference to his future history with which He followed it up.
   Between "I allow you, notwithstanding past misdemeanors, to be an
   apostle," and "I forewarn you that in that capacity you shall not have
   the freedom of action in which you rejoiced in former days," there is
   no connection traceable. Peter's fall did not suggest such a turn of
   thought; for it sprang not from the love of freedom, but from the fear
   of man.

   Not the restoration of Peter to a forfeited position, but his recall to
   a more solemn sense of his high vocation, do we find in this scene. Not
   "I allow you," but "I urge you," seems to us to be the burthen of
   Christ's words to this disciple, and through him to all his brethren.
   By all considerations He would move them to address themselves heart
   and soul to their apostolic work, and let boats and nets and every
   thing else alone for ever. "By the memory of thine own weakness," He
   would say to Simon for that end; "by my forgiving love, and thy
   gratitude for it; by the need of brother disciples, which thine own
   past frailty may teach thee to understand and compassionate; by the
   ardent attachment which I know you cherish towards myself: by these and
   all kindred considerations, I charge thee, on the eve of my departure,
   be a hero, play the man, be strong for others, not for thyself, feed
   the flock of God, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but
   willingly.' Shrink not from responsibility, covet not ease, bend thy
   neck to the yoke, and let love make it light. Sweet is liberty to thy
   human heart; but patient, burden-bearing love, though less pleasant, is
   far more noble."

   Such being the message which Jesus meant for all present, Peter was
   most appropriately selected as the medium for conveying it. He was an
   excellent text on which to preach a sermon on self-consecration. His
   character and conduct supplied all the poetry, and argument, and
   illustration necessary to give pathos and point to the theme. How dear
   to his impetuous, passionate spirit, unrestrained freedom! And what
   heart is not touched by the thought of such a man schooling his high,
   mettlesome soul into patience and submission? The young, frolicsome,
   bounding fisherman, girding on his coat, and going hither and thither
   at his own sweet will; the aged saintly apostle, meek as a lamb,
   stretching forth his arms to be bound for the martyr's doom: what a
   moving contrast! Had that passionate man, in some senses the strongest
   character among the twelve, been in other senses the weakest, then who
   could better illustrate men's need of shepherding? Had he learnt his
   own weakness, and through his knowledge thereof grown stronger? Then
   how better state the general duty of the strong to help the weak, than
   by assigning to this particular disciple the special duty of taking
   care of the weakest? To say to Peter, "Feed my lambs," was to say to
   all the apostles, "Feed my sheep."

   In requiring Peter to show his love by performing the part of shepherd
   to the little flock of believers, Jesus adapted His demand to the
   spiritual capacity of the disciple. Love to the Saviour does not
   necessarily take the form of feeding the sheep; in immature and
   inexperienced disciples, it rather takes the form of being sheep. It is
   only after the weak have become strong, and established in grace, that
   they ought to become shepherds, charging themselves with the care of
   others. In laying on Peter and his brethren pastoral duties, therefore,
   Jesus virtually announces that they have now passed, or are about to
   pass, out of the category of the weak into the category of the strong.
   "Hitherto," He virtually says to them, "ye have been as sheep, needing
   to be guided, watched over, and defended by the wisdom and courage of
   another. Now, however, the time is arrived when ye must become
   shepherds, able and willing to do for the weak what I have done for
   you. Hitherto ye have left me to care for you; henceforth you must
   accustom yourselves to be looked to as guardians, even as I have been
   by you. Hitherto ye have been as children under me, your parent;
   henceforth ye must yourselves be parents, taking charge of the
   children. Hitherto ye have been as raw recruits, liable to panic, and
   fleeing from danger; henceforth ye must be captains superior to fear,
   and by your calm determination inspire the soldiers of the cross with
   heroic daring." In short, Jesus here in effect announces to Peter and
   to the rest that they are now to make the transition from boyhood to
   manhood, from pupilage to self-government, from a position of
   dependence and exemption from care to one of influence, authority, and
   responsibility, as leaders and commanders in the Christian community,
   doing the work for which they have been so long under training. Such a
   transition and transformation did accordingly take place shortly after
   in the history of the disciples. They assumed the position of Christ's
   deputies or substitutes after His ascension, Peter being the leading or
   representative man, though not the Pope, in the infant Church; and
   their character was altered to fit them for their high functions. The
   timid disciples became bold apostles. Peter, who weakly denied the Lord
   in the judgment-hall, heroically confessed Him before the Sanhedrim.
   The ignorant and stupid disciples, who had been continually
   misunderstanding their Master's words, became filled with the spirit of
   wisdom and understanding, so that men listened to their words as they
   had been wont to listen to the words of Jesus Himself.

   We have said that love to Christ does not impose on all His disciples
   the duty of a shepherd; showing itself rather in by far the larger
   number in simply hearing the shepherd's voice and following him, and
   generally in a willingness to be guided by those who are wiser than
   themselves. We must add, that all who are animated by the spirit of
   love to the Redeemer, will be either shepherds or sheep, actively
   useful in caring for the souls of others, or thankfully using the
   provision made for the care of their own souls. Too many, however, come
   under neither designation. Some are sheep indeed, but sheep going
   astray; others are neither sheep nor shepherds, being self-reliant, yet
   indisposed to be helpful; too self-willed to be led, yet disinclined to
   make their strength and experience available for their brethren,
   utilizing all their talents for the exclusive service of their own
   private interests. Such men are to be found in Church and State,
   sedulously holding back from office and responsibility, and severely
   criticizing those who have come under the yoke; animadverting on their
   timidity and bondage, as unbroken colts, it they could speak, might
   animadvert on the tameness of horses in harness, the bits and bridles
   that form a part of church harness, in the shape of formulas and
   confessions, coming in for a double share of censure. [666]

   Now, it is all very well to be wild colts, rejoicing in unrestrained
   liberty, for a season in youth; but it will not do to be spurning the
   yoke all one's lifetime. "Ye, then, that are strong ought to bear the
   infirmities of the weak, and not to please yourselves." It is no doubt
   most agreeable to be free from care, and to walk about unfettered in
   opinion and action, and, shaking off those who would hang on our
   skirts, to live the life of gods, careless of mankind. But it is not
   the chief end of any man, least of all of a wise and strong man, to be
   free from care or trouble. He who has a Christian heart must feel that
   he is strong and wise for the sake of others who want strength and
   wisdom; and he will undertake the shepherd's office, though shrinking
   with fear and trembling from its responsibilities, and though conscious
   also that in so doing he is consenting to have his liberty and
   independence greatly circumscribed. The yoke of love which binds us to
   our fellows is sometimes not easy, and the burden of caring for them
   not light; but, on the whole, it is better and nobler to be a drudge
   and a slave at the bidding of love, than to be a free man through the
   emancipating power of selfishness. Better Peter a prisoner and martyr
   for the gospel, than Simon inculcating on his Lord the selfish policy,
   "Save Thyself," or lying in luxurious ease on the hill of
   Transfiguration, exclaiming, "Lord, it is good to be here." Better
   Peter bound by others, and led whither he would not, as a good shepherd
   to be sacrificed for the sheep, than Simon girding on his own garment,
   and walking along with the careless jaunty air of a modern
   pococurantist. A life on the ocean wave, a life in the woods, a life in
   the mountains or in the clouds, may be fine to dream and sing of; but
   the only life out of which genuine heroism and poetry comes, is that
   which is spent on this solid prosaic earth in the lowly work of doing
   good.

   Note now, finally, the evidence supplied in Peter's answers to his
   Lord's questions, that he is indeed fitted for the responsible work to
   which he is summoned. It is not merely that he can appeal to Jesus
   Himself, as one who knows all things, and say, "Thou knowest that I
   love Thee;." for, as we have already hinted, every sincere disciple can
   do that. Two specific signs of spiritual maturity are discernible here,
   not to be found in those who are weak in grace, not previously found in
   Peter himself. There is, first, marked modesty, -- very noticeable in
   so forward a man. Peter does not now make any comparisons between
   himself and his brethren as he had done previously. In spite of
   appearances, he still protests that he does love Jesus; but he takes
   care not to say, "I love Thee more than those." He not only does not
   say this, but he manifestly does not think it: the bragging spirit has
   left him; he is a humble, subdued, wise man, spiritually equipped for
   the pastorate, just because he has ceased to think himself supremely
   competent for it.

   The second mark of maturity discernible in Peter's replies is godly
   sorrow for past shortcoming: "Peter was grieved because He (Jesus) said
   unto him the third time, Lovest thou me?" He was grieved because by the
   threefold interrogation he was reminded that the threefold denial of
   which he had been guilty afforded ground for calling his love in
   question. Observe particularly the feeling produced by this delicate
   reference to his former sins. It was grief, not irritation, anger, or
   shame. There is no pride, passion, vanity in this man's soul, but only
   holy, meek contrition; no sudden coloring is observable in his
   countenance, but only the gracious softened expression of a penitent,
   chastised spirit. The man who can so take allusions to his sins is not
   only fit to tend the sheep, but even to nurse the lambs. He will
   restore those who have fallen in a spirit of meekness. He will be
   tender towards offenders, not with the spurious charity which cannot
   afford to condemn sin strongly, but with the genuine charity of one who
   has himself received mercy for sins sincerely repented of. By his
   benignant sympathy sinners will be converted unto God in unfeigned
   sorrow for their offences, and in humble hope of pardon; and by his
   watchful care many sheep will be kept from ever straying from the fold.

  SECTION II -- PASTOR PASTORUM

    John xxi. 19-22.

   To be a dutiful under-shepherd is, in another view, to be a faithful
   sheep, following the Chief Shepherd whithersoever He goes. Pastors are
   not lords over God's heritage, but mere servants of Christ, the great
   Head of the Church, bound to regard His will as their law, and His life
   as their model. In the scene by the lake Jesus took pains to make His
   disciples understand this. He did not allow them to suppose that, in
   committing to their pastoral charge His flock, He was abdicating His
   position as Shepherd and Bishop of souls. Having said to Peter, "Feed
   my lambs," "Feed my sheep," He said to him, as His final word, "Follow
   me."

   It is implied in the narrative, that while Jesus said this, He arose
   and walked away from the spot where the disciples had just taken their
   morning meal. Whither He went we are not told, but it may have been
   towards that "mountain in Galilee," the preappointed rendezvous where
   the risen Saviour met "above five hundred brethren at once." The sheep
   have doubtless been wending thither to meet their divine Shepherd, as
   in a secluded upland fold; and it is more than possible that the object
   of the journey in which Peter is invited to join his Master, is to
   introduce him to the flock which had just been committed to his care.

   Be this as it may, Peter obeyed the summons, and rose at once to follow
   Jesus. His first impression probably was that he was to be the solitary
   attendant of his Lord, and a natural wish to ascertain the state of the
   case led him to look behind to see what his companions were doing. On
   turning round, he observed the disciple whom Jesus loved, and whom he
   too loved, following close in his footsteps; and the question forthwith
   rose to his lips, "Lord, and what of this man?" The question was
   elliptical, but it meant: John is coming after us; Is the same lot in
   store for him that you have prophesied for me? Shall he too be bound
   and led whither he would not; or shall he, as the disciple most dearly
   beloved, be exempted from the hardships I am fated to endure?

   That another and a happier fortune was reserved for John seemed, we
   believe, probable to Peter. He could not but recall to mind that
   memorable scene in which John's mother made her ambitious request for
   her two sons; and in spite of what Jesus had said to them about tasting
   of His cup, and being baptized with His baptism, he, Peter, might well
   imagine that John's desire would be fulfilled, and that he would live
   to see the kingdom come, and to share its glories; especially as one
   and all of the disciples, down to the very last day of their Lord's
   sojourn on earth, still expected the kingdom to be restored to Israel
   very soon. If such was Peter's thought, it is not surprising that he
   should ask, if not with envy, at least with a sadder sense of his own
   loss, "Lord, what of this man?" Adversity is hard to bear at best, but
   hardest of all when personal ill-fortune stands in glaring contrast
   with the prosperity of a brother who started on his career at the same
   time, and with no better prospects than the man whom he has far
   outstripped in the race.

   To such considerations, however, Jesus paid little respect in His reply
   to Peter's question. "If I will," He said, "that he tarry till I come,
   what is that to thee? Follow thou me." "How stern and unfeeling!" one
   is tempted to exclaim. Might not Jesus at least have reminded Simon,
   for his comfort, of the words He once uttered to James and John: "Ye
   shall drink of my cup"? Would it not have helped Peter more cheerfully
   to follow his Master in the arduous path of the cross, to have told him
   that, in whatever manner John might die, he too would have to suffer
   for the gospel; that his life, whether long or short, would be full of
   tribulation; that participation in the glory of the kingdom did not
   depend on longevity; that, in fact, the first to die would be the first
   to enter into glory? But no, it might not be. To administer such
   comfort would have been to indulge the disciple's weakness. One who has
   to play a soldier's part must be trained with military rigor.
   Effeminacy, sighing after happiness, brooding over the felicity we have
   missed, are out of place in an apostle's character; and Jesus, to whom
   such dispositions are most abhorrent, will take good care not to give
   them any countenance. He will have all His followers, and specially the
   heads of His people, to be heroes, -- "Ironsides," prompt to do
   bidding, fearless of danger, patient of fatigue, without a trace of
   selfish softness. He will give no quarter even to natural weaknesses,
   disregards present pain, cares not how we smart under rebuke, provided
   only He gain His end, -- the production of character temptation-proof.

   Having this end in view, Jesus took no trouble to correct Peter's
   misapprehensions about his brother disciple. Misapprehensions, we say,
   for such they indeed were. John did not tarry till the Lord came in the
   sense in which Peter understood the words. He lived, indeed, till the
   close of the first Christian century, therefore long after the Lord's
   coming to execute judgment on Jerusalem. But except for the longevity
   he enjoyed, the last of the apostles was in no respect to be envied.
   The Church was militant all his days: he took part in many of its
   battles, and received therein many scars. Companion with Peter in the
   Church's first conflict with the world, he was a prisoner in Patmos for
   the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ, after Peter had
   fallen asleep. One might perhaps say that, owing to temperament, the
   life of John was less stirring than that of his brother apostle. He was
   a man of less impetuosity, though not of less intensity; and there was,
   perhaps, not so much in his character provocative of the world's
   opposition. Both by his virtues and by his infirmities Peter was
   predestined to be the champion of the faith, the Luther of the
   apostolic age, giving and receiving the hardest blows, and bearing the
   brunt of the battle. John, on the other hand, was the Melanchthon among
   the apostles, without, however, Melanchthon's tendency to yield; and as
   such, enjoyed probably a quieter, and, on the whole, more peacefull
   life. But this difference between the two men was, after all, quite
   subordinate; and, all things considered, we may say that John drank not
   less deeply of Christ's cup than did Peter. There was nothing glorious
   or enviable in his lot on earth, except the vision in Patmos of the
   glory yet to be revealed.

   Yet while all this was clear to His prescient eye, Jesus did not
   condescend to give any explanations concerning the appointed lot of the
   beloved disciple, but allowed Peter to think what he pleased about the
   future of his friend. "If I will," He said, "that he tarry till I come,
   what is that to thee?" not meaning to give any information, as
   contemporary believers imagined, but rather refusing to give any in the
   bluntest and most peremptory manner. "Suppose" -- such is the import of
   the words -- "Suppose it were my pleasure that John should remain on
   the earth till I return to it, what is that to thee? Suppose I were to
   grant him to sit on my right hand in my Messianic kingdom, what, I ask
   again, is that to thee? Suppose John were not to taste of death, but,
   surviving till my second advent, were, like another Elijah, to be
   wafted directly into heaven, or to be endowed in his body with the
   power of an endless life, still what is that to thee? Follow thou Me."

   The emphatic repetition of this injunction is very significant. It
   shows, for one thing, that when Jesus said to Peter, "Feed my sheep,"
   He had no intention of making him a pastor of pastors, a shepherd or
   bishop over his fellow-disciples. In Roman Catholic theology the lambs
   are the lay members of the church, and the sheep are the under
   shepherds -- the whole body of the clergy, the Pope excepted. How
   strange, if this be true, that Peter should be checked for looking
   after one of the flock, and asking so simple a question as that, "Lord,
   and what shall this man do?" Jesus replies to him as if he were a
   busybody, meddling with matters with which he had no concern. And,
   indeed, busybodyism was one of Peter's faults. He was fond of looking
   after and managing other people; he tried once and again to manage the
   Lord Himself. Curiously enough, it is from this apostle that the Church
   gets the needful warning against the too common vice just named. "Let
   none of you," he writes in his first epistle, "suffer as a murderer, or
   as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a busybody in other men's
   matters;." literally, as a bishop intruding into another's diocese.
   [667] Evidently the frequent rebukes administered to Peter by his
   Master had made a lasting impression on him.

   Heavy as was the load of responsibility laid upon this disciple at this
   time, it did not amount to any thing so formidable as that involved in
   being a visible Christ, so to speak, to the whole Church. Neither Peter
   nor any other man is able to bear that burden, and happily no one is
   required to do so. The responsibility of even the highest in the Church
   is restricted within comparatively narrow limits. The main business,
   even of the chief under-shepherds, is not to make others follow Christ,
   but to follow Him themselves. It is well that our Lord made this plain
   by the words addressed to the representative man among the apostles;
   for Christians of active, energetic, and earnest natures are very apt
   to have very exaggerated ideas of their responsibilities, and to take
   on themselves the care of the whole world, and impose on themselves the
   duty of remedying every evil that is done under the sun. They would be
   defenders-general of the faith wherever assailed, redressers-general of
   all wrongs, curates-general of all souls. There is something noble as
   well as quixotic in this temper; and it were not the best sign of a
   man's moral earnestness if he had not at some time of his life known
   somewhat of this fussy, over-zealous spirit. Still it should be
   understood that the Head of the Church imposes on no man such unlimited
   responsibility, and that, when self-imposed, it does not conduce to a
   man's real usefulness. No one man can do all other men's work, and no
   one man is responsible for all other men's errors and failures; and
   each man contributes most effectually and surely to the good of the
   whole by conducting his own life on godly principles. The world is full
   of evils-scepticism, superstition, ignorance, immorality, on every side
   -- a sight saddening in the extreme. What, then, am I to do?" This one
   thing above all: Follow thou Christ. Be thou a believer, let who will
   be infidels. Let thy religion be reasonable, let who will pin their
   faith to a fallible human authority, and place their religion in
   fantastic ritualisms and gross idolatries. Be thou holy, an example of
   sobriety, justice, and godliness, though all the world should become a
   sweltering chaos of impurity, fraud, and impiety. Say with Joshua of
   old, "If it seem good unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day
   whom ye will serve; but as for me and my house, we will serve the
   Lord."

   The repeated injunction, "Follow thou me," whilst restricting
   individual responsibility, prescribes undivided attention to personal
   duty. Christ demands of His disciples that they follow Him with
   integrity of heart, without distraction, without murmuring, envy, or
   calculations of consequences. Peter was, it is to be feared, not yet up
   to the mark in this respect. There was yet lingering in his heart a
   vulgar hankering after happiness as the chief end of man. Exemption
   from the cross still appeared to him supremely desirable, and he
   probably fancied that special favor on Christ's part towards a
   particular disciple would show itself in granting such exemption. He
   did not yet understand that Christ oftenest shows special favor to His
   followers by making them in a remarkable degree partakers of His bitter
   cup and His bloody baptism. The grand enthusiasm of Paul, which made
   him desire to know Jesus in the fellowship of His sufferings, had not
   yet taken possession of Simon's breast. When an arduous and perilous
   piece of service was to be done, those who were selected to be the
   forlorn hope seemed to him objects of pity rather than of envy. Far
   from volunteering for such a service, he would rather congratulate
   himself on having escaped it; and the highest conceivable virtue, in
   case one were so unlucky as not to escape, would, in his opinion, be
   submission to the inevitable.

   Peter was deficient also as yet in the military virtue of unquestioning
   obedience to orders, which is the secret of an army's strength. A
   general says to one, Go, and he Goeth; to another, Come, and he cometh:
   he appoints to one corps its station here, and to another its station
   there; and no one ventures to ask why, or to make envious comparisons.
   There is an absolute surrender of the individual will to the will of
   the commander; and so far as thoughts of preference are concerned each
   man is a machine, having a will, a head, a hand, a heart, only for the
   effective performance of his own appointed task. Peter had not yet
   attained to this pitch of self-abnegation. He could not do simply what
   he was bidden, but must needs look round to see what another was doing.
   Nor let us think this a small offence in him. It was a breach of
   discipline which could not be overlooked by the Commander of the
   faithful. Implicit obedience is as necessary in the Church as it is in
   the army. The old soldier Loyola understood this, and hence he
   introduced a system of military discipline into the constitution of the
   so called "Society of Jesus." And the history of that society shows the
   wisdom of the founder; for whatever we may think of the quality of the
   work done, we cannot deny the energy of the Jesuitic fraternity, or the
   devotion of its members. Such devotion as the Jesuit renders to the
   will of his spiritual superior Christ demands of all His people; and to
   none except Himself can it be rendered without impiety. He would have
   every believer give himself up to His will in cheerful, exact, habitual
   obedience, deeming all His orders wise, all His arrangements good,
   acknowledging His right to dispose of us as He pleases, content to
   serve Him in a little place or in a large one, by doing or by
   suffering, for a long period or a short, in life or by death, if only
   He be glorified.

   This is our duty, and it is also our blessedness. So minded, we shall
   be delivered from all care of consequences, from ambitious views of our
   responsibilities, from imaginary grievances, from envy, fretfulness and
   the restlessness of self-will. We shall no longer be distracted or
   tormented with incessant looking round to see what is become of this or
   that fellow-disciple, but be able to go on with our own work in
   composure and peace. We shall not trouble ourselves either about our
   own future or about that of any other person, but shall healthily and
   happily live in the present. We shall get rid for ever of fear, and
   care, and scheming, and disappointment, and chagrin, and, like larks at
   heaven's gate, sing: --


   "Father, I know that all my life

   Is portioned out by Thee,

   And the changes that will surely come

   I do not fear to see;

   But I ask Thee for a present mind,

   Intent on serving Thee.


   I would not have the restless will

   That hurries to and fro,

   Seeking for some great thing to do,

   Or secret thing to know;

   I would be treated as a child,

   And guided where I go."

   Thus, brother, "go thou thy way till the end be;." and "thou shalt
   rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days."

30. POWER FROM ON HIGH

    Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:47-53; Acts 1:1-8.

   From Galilee the disciples, of their own accord or by direction, found
   their way back to Jerusalem, where their risen Lord showed Himself to
   them once more, and for the last time, to give them their final
   instructions, and to bid them farewell.

   Of this last meeting no distinct notice is taken in the Gospels. Each
   of the synoptical evangelists, however, has preserved some of the last
   words spoken by Jesus to His disciples ere He ascended to heaven. Among
   these we reckon the closing verses of Matthew's Gospel, where we read:
   "All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye
   therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them into the
   name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching
   them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I
   am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." [668] Of this last
   word Mark gives, in the close of his Gospel, an abbreviated version, in
   these terms: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the
   whole creation." [669] In Luke's narrative the words spoken by Jesus on
   the occasion of His final appearance to the eleven are so interwoven
   with those which He spoke to them on the evening of His resurrection
   day, that, but for the supplementary and more circumstantial account
   given by the same author in the Book of the Acts, we should never have
   thought of making a distinction, far less have known where to place the
   boundary line. On comparing the two accounts, however, we can see that
   words spoken at two different times are construed together into one
   continuous discourse; and we have no great difficulty in determining
   what belongs to the first appearance and what to the last. According to
   the Book of Acts, Jesus, in His last conversation with His disciples,
   spoke to them of their apostolic duties as witnesses unto Himself and
   preachers of His gospel; of the promise of the Spirit, whose descent
   was to fit them for their work; and of what they should do till the
   promise should be fulfilled. Now these are just the topics adverted to
   in the verses cited from the last chapter of Luke's Gospel. There is
   first the apostolic commission to preach repentance and remission of
   sins in the name of Jesus among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem;
   and a virtual injunction laid on the disciples to be faithful witnesses
   to all things they had seen and heard in their Lord's company, and
   especially to His resurrection from the dead. Then there is the renewal
   of this promise, here called the "promise of my Father." Then, finally,
   there is the direction to wait for the promised blessing in the holy
   city: "But tarry ye at Jerusalem until ye be clothed with power from on
   high."

   All these sayings bear internal evidence of being last words, from
   their fitness to the situation. It was natural and needful that Jesus
   should thus speak to His chosen agents at the hour of His final
   departure, giving them instructions for their guidance in their future
   apostolic labors, and in the short interval that was to elapse before
   those labors began. Even the business-like brevity and matter-of-fact
   tone of these last words betray the occasion on which they were
   uttered. On first thoughts, we should perhaps have expected a more
   pathetic style of address in connection with a farewell meeting; but,
   on reflection, we perceive that every thing savoring of sentimentality
   would have been beneath the dignity of the situation. In the farewell
   address before the passion, pathos was in place; but in the farewell
   words before the ascension, it would have been misplaced. In the former
   case, Jesus was a parent speaking His last words of counsel and comfort
   to His sorrowing children; in the latter, He was "as a man taking a far
   journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to
   every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch;." [670] and His
   manner of speech was adapted to the character He sustained.

   And yet the tone adopted by Jesus in His last interview with the eleven
   was not purely magisterial. The Friend was not altogether lost in the
   Master. He had kind words as well as commands for His servants. What
   could be kinder and more encouraging than that word: "And, lo, I am
   with you alway, even unto the end of the world "? And is there not an
   accent of friendship in that utterance, in which Jesus, now about to
   ascend to glory, seems by anticipation to resume the robe of divine
   majesty, which He laid aside when He became man: "All power is given
   unto me in heaven and in earth"? Why does He say that now? Not for the
   purpose of self-exaltation; not to put a distance between Himself and
   His quondam companions, and, as it were, degrade them from the position
   of friends to that of mere servants. No; but to cheer them on their way
   through the world as the messengers of the kingdom; to make them feel
   that the task assigned them was not, as it might well seem, an
   impossible one. "I have all power," saith He in effect, "in heaven, and
   jurisdiction over all the earth: go ye therefore [671] into all the
   world, making disciples of all the nations, nothing doubting that all
   spiritual influences and all providential agencies will be made
   subservient to the great errand on which I send you."

   Jesus had kind actions as well as kind words for His friends at
   parting. There was indeed no farewell kiss, or shaking of hands, or
   other symbolic act in use among men who bid each other adieu; but the
   manner of the ascension was most gracious and benignant towards those
   whom the ascending One left behind. Jesus moved upwards as if lifted
   from the earth by some celestial attraction, with His face looking
   downwards upon His beloved companions, and with His hand stretched out
   in an attitude of benediction. Hence the eleven grieved not for their
   Lord's disappearance. They marvelled indeed, and gazed eagerly and
   wonderingly towards the skies, as if trying to penetrate the cloud
   which received their Master's person; but the parting left no sadness
   behind. They bowed their heads in worship towards the ascended Christ,
   and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, as if they had gained, not
   lost a friend, and as if the ascension were not a sunset but a sunrise
   -- as indeed it was, not for them alone, but for the whole world.

   Of that miraculous event, by which our High Priest passed within the
   veil into the celestial sanctuary, we may not speak. Like the
   transfiguration, it is a topic on which we know not what to say; an
   event not to be explained, but to be devoutly and joyfully believed, in
   company with the kindred truth declared by the two men in white apparel
   to the disciples, who said: "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing
   into heaven? This same Jesus, which was taken up from you into heaven,
   shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven." [672]
   Wherefore we pass from the ascension to make some observations on the
   great commission given by the Lord to His apostles for the last time,
   just before He was taken up into glory.

   That commission was worthy of Him from whom it emanated, whether we
   regard Him as Son of God or as Son of man. "Go ye into all the world,
   and preach the gospel to the whole creation." Surely this is the
   language of a Divine Being. What mere man ever entertained a plan of
   beneficence embracing the whole human race within its scope? and who
   but one possessing all power in heaven and on earth could dare to hope
   for success in so gigantic an undertaking? Then how full of grace and
   love the matter of the commission! The errand on which Jesus sends His
   apostles is to preach repentance and remission of sins in His name, and
   to make a peaceful conquest of the world to God by the word of
   reconciliation through His death. Such philanthropy approves itself to
   be at once divine and most intensely human. And mark, as specially
   characteristic of the gracious One, the direction, "beginning at
   Jerusalem." The words indicate a plan of operations adapted at once to
   the circumstances of the world, and to the capacities and
   idiosyncrasies of the agents; but they do more. They open a window into
   the heart of Jesus, and show Him to be the same who prayed on the
   cross: "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do." Why
   begin at Jerusalem? Because "Jerusalem sinners" most need to repent and
   to be forgiven; and because Jesus would show forth in them at the
   outset the full extent of His long-suffering, for a pattern to them who
   should afterwards believe, in Samaria, Antioch, and the uttermost parts
   of the earth.

   It was in every way a commission worthy of Jesus, as the Son of God and
   Saviour of sinners, to give. But what a commission for poor Galilean
   fishermen to receive! what a burden of responsibility to lay upon the
   shoulders of any poor mortal! Who is sufficient for these things? Jesus
   knew the insufficiency of His instruments. Therefore, having invested
   them with official authority, He proceeded to speak of an investment
   with another kind of power, without which the official must needs be
   utterly ineffectual. "And, behold," He said, "I send the promise of my
   Father upon you; but tarry ye at Jerusalem till ye be clothed with
   power from on high."

   "Power from on high:." the expression has a mystical sound, and its
   sense seems difficult to define; yet the general meaning is surely
   plain enough. The thing signified is not altogether or chiefly a power
   to work miracles, but just what Jesus had spoken of at such length in
   his farewell address before His death. "Power from on high" means: All
   that the apostles were to gain from the mission of the Comforter --
   enlightenment of mind, enlargement of heart, sanctification of their
   faculties, and transformation of their characters, so as to make them
   whetted swords and polished shafts for subduing the world unto the
   truth; these, or the effect of these combined, constituted the power
   for which Jesus directed the eleven to wait. The power, therefore, was
   a spiritual power, not a magical; an inspiration, not a possession; a
   power which was not to act as a blind fanatical force, but to manifest
   itself as a spirit of love and of a sound mind. After the power
   descended, the apostles were to be not less rational, but more; not
   mad, but sober-minded; not excited rhapsodists, but calm, clear,
   dignified expositors of divine truth, such as they appear in Luke's
   history of their ministry. In a word, they were to be less like their
   past selves and more like their Master: no longer ignorant, childish,
   weak, carnal, but initiated into the mysteries of the kingdom, and
   habitually under the guidance of the Spirit of grace and holiness.

   Such being the power promised, it was evidently indispensable to
   success. Vain were official titles -- apostles, evangelists, pastors,
   teachers, rulers; vain clerical robes, without this garment of divine
   power to clothe the souls of the eleven. Vain then, and equally vain
   now. The world is to be evangelized, not by men invested with
   ecclesiastical dignities and with parti-colored garments, but by men
   who have experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and who are visibly
   endued with the divine power of wisdom, and love, and zeal.

   As the promised power was indispensable, so it was in its nature a
   thing simply to be waited for. The disciples were directed to tarry
   till it came. They were neither to attempt to do without it, nor were
   they to try to get it up. And they were wise enough to follow their
   instructions. They fully understood that the power was needful, and
   that it could not be got up, but must come down. All are not equally
   wise. Many virtually assume that the power Christ spake of can be
   dispensed with, and that in fact it is not a reality, but a chimera.
   Others, more devout, believe in the power, but not in man's impotence
   to invest himself with it. They try to get the power up by working
   themselves and others into a frenzy of excitement. Failure sooner or
   later convinces both parties of their mistake, showing the one that to
   produce spiritual results something more than eloquence, intellect,
   money, and organization are required; and showing the other that true
   spiritual power cannot be produced, like electric sparks, by the
   friction of excitement, but must come sovereignly and graciously down
   from on high.

31. WAITING

    Acts 1:12-14:1. [673]

   After that the Lord was parted from them, and carried up into heaven,
   the eleven returned to Jerusalem, and did as they had been commanded.
   They assembled together in an upper room in the city, and, in company
   with the believing women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and His kinsmen
   and other brethren, amounting in all to one hundred and twenty, waited
   for Power and for Light as men who wait for the dawn; or as men who
   have come to see a panorama wait for the lifting of the curtain that
   hides from view scenes which their eyes have not seen, nor their ears
   heard of, nor hath it entered into their hearts to conceive. These
   verses from the first chapter of the "Acts" show us the disciples and
   the rest in the act of so waiting.

   How solemn is the situation of these men at this crisis in their
   history! They are about to undergo a spiritual transformation; to pass,
   so to speak, from the chrysalis to the winged state. They are on the
   eve of the great illumination promised by Jesus before His death. The
   Spirit of Truth is about to come and lead them into all Christian
   truth. The day-star is about to arise in their hearts, after the
   dreary, pitchy night of mental perplexity and despairing sorrow through
   which they have recently passed. They are about to be endowed with
   power of utterance and of character proportional to their enlarged
   comprehension of the words and work of Christ, so that men hearing them
   shall be amazed, and say one to another: "Behold, are not all these
   which speak Galileans? And now hear we every man in our own tongue
   wherein we were born the wonderful works of God." [674] With a dim
   presentiment of what is coming, with hearts which throb and swell under
   the excitement of expectation, and heaving with wondering thoughts of
   the great things about to be revealed, they sit there in that upper
   room for ten long days, and wait for the promise of the rather. Verily
   it is an impressive, a sublime scene.

   But how do they wait? Do they sit still and silent, Quaker fashion, all
   that time expecting the descent of the Power? No; the meeting in the
   upper room was not a Quaker meeting. They prayed, they even transacted
   business; for in those days Peter stood up and proposed the election of
   a new apostle in the room of Judas, gone to his own place. Nor was
   their meeting a dull one, as those may imagine who have never passed
   through any great spiritual crisis, and to whom waiting on God is a
   synonym for listless indolence. The hundred and twenty believers did
   not, we may be sure, suffer from ennui. Prayers and supplications alone
   filled up many blessed hours. For to men in the situation of the
   disciples prayer is not the dull "devotional" form with which we in
   these degenerate days are too familiar. It is rather a wrestling with
   God, during which hours passed unobserved, and the day breaks before
   one is aware. "These all continued with one accord in prayer and
   supplication." They prayed without fainting, without wearying, with one
   heart and mind.

   Besides praying, the waiting disciples doubtless spent part of their
   time in reading the Scriptures. This is not stated; but it may be
   assumed as a matter of course, and it may also be inferred from the
   manner in which Peter handled Old Testament texts in his address to the
   people on the day of Pentecost. That pentecostal sermon bears marks of
   previous preparation. It was in one sense an extempore effusion, under
   the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, but in another it was the fruit of
   careful study. Peter and his brethren had, without doubt, reperused all
   those passages which Jesus had expounded on the evening of the day on
   which He rose from the dead, and among them that psalm of David, whose
   words the apostle quoted in his first gospel sermon, in support of the
   doctrine of Christ's resurrection. We may find evidence of the minute,
   careful attention bestowed on that and other Messianic portions of
   Scripture in the exactness with which the quotation is given. The four
   verses of the psalm stand word for word in Peter's discourse as they do
   in the original text -- a fact all the more remarkable that New
   Testament speakers and writers do not, as a rule, slavishly adhere to
   the ipsissima verba in their Old Testament citations, but quote texts
   somewhat freely.

   The spiritual exercises of those ten days would be further diversified
   by religious conversation. The reading of Scripture would naturally
   give rise to comments and queries. The brethren who had been privileged
   to hear Jesus expound the things which were written in the law, and in
   the prophets, and in the psalms concerning Himself, on the night of His
   resurrection-day, would not fail to give their fellow-believers the
   benefit of instructions through which their own understandings had been
   opened. Peter, who was so prompt to propose the election of a new
   witness to the resurrection of Jesus, would be not less prompt to tell
   the company in the upper room what the risen Jesus had said about these
   Old Testament texts. He would freely speak to them of the meaning Jesus
   taught him to find in the sixteenth Psalm, just as he took the liberty
   of doing afterwards in addressing the multitude in the streets of
   Jerusalem. When that psalm had been read, he would say: "Men and
   brethren, thus and thus did the Lord Jesus interpret these words;."
   just as, when the 109th Psalm had been read, he stood up and said: "Men
   and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the
   Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas: for it
   is written, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell
   therein; and his bishopric let another take. Wherefore" -- let us
   choose another to fill his place.

   Thus did the brethren occupy themselves during these ten days. They
   prayed, they read the Scriptures, they conferred together on what they
   read and on what they expected to see. So they continued waiting with
   one accord in one place till the day of Pentecost was fully come, when
   suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind,
   filling all the house where they were sitting; and there appeared unto
   them cloven tongues like as of fire, and they were all filled with the
   Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave
   them utterance. Then the promise was fulfilled, the Power had come down
   from on high, in a manner illustrating the words of the prophet: "Since
   the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the
   ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside Thee, what he hath
   prepared for him that waiteth for him."

   The events of Pentecost were the answer to the prayers offered up
   during those ten days, which we may call the incubation period of the
   Christian Church. And that the lesson of encouragement to be learned
   from this fact may not be lost, it may be well to remember that the
   prayers of those assembled in the upper room were not essentially
   different from the prayers of saints at any other period in the
   Church's history. They had reference to much the same objects. The
   eleven and the others prayed for the promised Power, for additional
   light on the meaning of Scripture, for the coming of the divine kingdom
   on earth. And while they prayed for these things, we believe, with
   peculiar fervor, they did not pray for them with extraordinary
   intelligence. Of them, perhaps more emphatically than of most, it might
   be said that they knew not what to pray for as they ought. They had
   very indistinct ideas, we believe, of the "power," of its nature, and
   of the effects it was to produce. That they had crude, and even
   erroneous ideas of the "kingdom," we know; for it is recorded that on
   the very day of His ascension they asked Jesus the question, "Dost Thou
   at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" [675] In this brief
   question three gross misconceptions are contained. It is assumed that
   Christ was to reign personally on the earth, a great king, like David.
   The disciples had no idea whatever of an ascension into heaven. Then
   the kingdom they expect is merely a national Jewish one. "Dost Thou,"
   they ask, "restore the kingdom to Israel?" Finally, the kingdom looked
   for by them is political, not spiritual: it is not a new creation, but
   a kingdom of earth restored from a present prostrate condition to
   former power and splendor.

   The notions of the eleven concerning the kingdom continued to be much
   the same to the day of Pentecost as they had been on the day of the
   ascension. It is true that Jesus had, in His reply to their question,
   made a statement which, if rightly understood, was fitted to correct
   their misconceptions. Formally a declinature to give information on the
   subject about which the disciples were curious, that reply afforded a
   sufficiently clear and full explanation of the real state of the case.
   When He spoke of the power which they should receive, Jesus not
   obscurely hinted that the work of inaugurating the kingdom was to be
   done by the apostles as His commissioners, not by Himself in person.
   And the same thing is implied in the words, "Ye shall be witnesses unto
   me," for witnesses would be needed only for one who was himself unseen.
   By connecting the "power" with the descent of the Holy Ghost, Jesus in
   effect corrected the third mistake of the eleven concerning the kingdom
   -- the notion, viz., that it was to be of a political nature. Power
   arising out of a baptism of the Spirit is moral, not political, in its
   character; and a kingdom founded through such power is not a kingdom of
   this world, but one whose subjects and citizens consist of men
   believing the truth: "of the truth," as Jesus Himself put it in
   speaking of His kingdom before Pilate. And, in the last place, the
   words, "Witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in
   Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth," were certainly
   fitted to banish from the minds of the eleven the dream of a merely
   national Jewish kingdom. If it was but the kingdom of Israel that was
   to be restored, to what purpose bear witness to Jesus to the world's
   end? Such witness-bearing speaks to a kingdom of a universal nature,
   embracing people of every tongue and kindred under heaven.

   From the reply of their Lord the disciples might thus have gathered the
   true idea of the kingdom, as one founded on faith in Christ; presided
   over by a king, no longer present bodily, but omnipresent spiritually;
   not limited to one country, but embracing all who were of the truth in
   all parts of the world. This great idea, however, they did not take out
   of the words on which we have been commenting. They were to learn the
   nature of the kingdom, not from the teaching of Jesus, but from the
   events of providence. The panorama of the kingdom of God was to be hid
   from their eyes till the curtain was lifted in three distinct
   historical movements -- the ascension, the descent of the Spirit at
   Pentecost on the multitude who had come to keep the feast, and the
   conversion of Samaritans and the Gentiles. [676] The first of these
   movements had already taken place when the disciples assembled
   themselves together in the upper room to wait for the promise of the
   Father. Jesus had ascended, so that they now knew that the seat of
   empire, the capital of the kingdom, was to be in heaven, not in
   Jerusalem. This was a valuable piece of knowledge, but it was not all
   that was needed. Only a small part of the panorama was yet visible to
   the spectators, and they were still in the dark as to the nature and
   extent of the coming kingdom. They expected to see a panorama of a new
   Palestine, not of a new heaven and a new earth wherein should dwell
   righteousness; and they doubtless continued to cherish this expectation
   till the curtain was uplifted, and facts showed what they had
   unwittingly been praying for, when they at length learned that the
   Hearer of prayer not only does for His people what they ask, but far
   above what they even think.

   This waiting scene, looked at in relation to the subsequent events
   recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, not to say the whole history of
   the Church, suggests another observation. We may learn therefrom what
   significance may lie in things apparently very insignificant. We had
   occasion to make this remark in connection with the first meeting of
   Jesus with five of those who afterwards became members of the chosen
   band of twelve, and we think it seasonable to repeat it here now. To
   the contemporary Jewish world that meeting in the upper room, if they
   knew of its existence, would appear a very contemptible matter, yet it
   was the only thing of perennial interest in Judea at the time. The hope
   of Israel, yea, of the world, lay in that small congregation. For small
   as it was, God was with those who formed it. Infidels who believe not
   in supernatural influence smile at such words; but even they must
   acknowledge that some source of power was centred in that little
   community, for they multiplied with a rapidity surpassing that of the
   Israelites in Egypt. Those who reject divine influence impose on
   themselves the burden of a very laborious explanation of the fact. For
   those who believe in that influence it is enough to say the little
   flock grew great, not by might, nor by power of this world, but by
   God's Spirit. It was their Father's good pleasure to give them the
   kingdom.

   And now, in taking leave of those men with whom we have so long held
   goodly fellowship, it may be well here to indicate in a sentence, by
   way of rÃ©sumÃ©, the sum of the teaching they had received from their
   Master. By such a summary, indeed, it is impossible to convey an
   adequate idea of the training for their future career which they had
   enjoyed, seeing that by far the most important part of that training
   consisted in the simple fact of being for years with such an one as
   Jesus. Yet it may be well to let our readers see at a glance that,
   unsystematic and occasional as was the instruction communicated by
   Jesus to His disciples, therein differing utterly from the teaching
   given in theological schools, yet in the course of the time during
   which He and they were together lessons of priceless worth were given
   by the Divine Master to His pupils on not a few subjects of cardinal
   importance. To enumerate the topics, as far as possible in the order in
   which they have been considered in this work, Jesus gave His disciples
   lessons on the nature of the divine kingdom; [677] on prayer; [678] on
   religious liberty, or the nature of true holiness; [679] on His own
   Person and claims; [680] on the doctrine of the cross and the import of
   His death; [681] on humility and kindred virtues, or on the right
   Christian temper required of disciples both in their private life and
   in their ecclesiastical life; [682] on the doctrine of self-sacrifice;
   [683] on the leaven of Pharisaism and Sadduceeism, and the woes it was
   to bring on the Jewish nation; [684] on the mission of the Comforter,
   to convince the world and to enlighten themselves. [685] The teaching
   conveyed, assuming that we have even an approximately correct account
   of it in the Gospels, was fitted to make the disciples what they were
   required to be as the apostles of a spiritual and universal religion:
   enlightened in mind, endowed with a charity wide enough to embrace all
   mankind, having their conscience tremulously sensitive to all claims of
   duty, yet delivered from all superstitious scruples, emancipated from
   the fetters of custom, tradition, and the commandments of men, and
   possessing tempers purged from pride, self-will, impatience, angry
   passions, vindictiveness, and implacability. That they were slow to
   learn, and even when their Master left them were far from perfect, we
   have frankly admitted; still they were men of such excellent moral
   stuff, that it might be confidently anticipated that having been so
   long with Jesus they would prove themselves exceptionally good and
   noble men when they came before the world as leaders in a great
   movement, called to act on their own responsibility. Not, certainly, as
   we believe, without the aid of the promised power from on high, not
   without the enlightening, sanctifying influence of the Paraclete; yet
   even those who have no faith in supernatural influence must admit on
   purely psychological grounds, that men who had received such an
   exceptional training were likely to acquit themselves wisely, bravely,
   heroically as public characters. According to the actual narrative in
   the Acts of the Apostles, they did so acquit themselves. According to a
   well-known school of critics, they acquitted themselves very poorly
   indeed -- in a manner utterly unworthy of their great Master. Which
   view is the more credible, that of the evangelist Luke, or that of Dr.
   Baur?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [673] The portions of the evangelic history and of the Acts of the
   Apostles referred to in this chapter contain much debatable matter. But
   as it would be quite unsuitable to the character of this work to enter
   into disputed questions at length, we give our own construction of
   events without reference to the sceptical views of many modern critics.

   [674] Acts ii. 7-11.

   [675] Acts i. 6.

   [676] Compare remarks on p. 495 on the slow-mindedness of the
   disciples, preventing them from understanding the words of Christ till
   these were interpreted and illuminated by events.
