TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

   IT was a pleasant, sunny morning in May of last year, when I called at
   the modest house in Leipzig where the world-renowned Professor
   Tischendorf makes his home. It lies in a quiet, pleasant part of the
   city, away from its narrow streets, with their tall, grim, gaunt, gray
   buildings, some of them centuries old, away from the quaint churches,
   the castellated and fantastic Rath Haus, or City Hall, as we should
   call it, away from the places which Bach, and Mendelssohn, and Goethe,
   and Dr. Faustus used to frequent, and in the new and cheerful streets
   of the New Town. For Leipzig grows like an American city; its ancient
   limits no longer hold it in, but it is shooting away into the country
   on all sides, and turning the battle-field where Napoleon received his
   first great shock, into densely-built streets and squares. One would
   almost think that a paleographist like Tischendorf, a man whose
   life-work is the exhuming of lost and buried manuscripts and the making
   out of their contents, would choose for his home one of those old,
   weather-beaten, gaunt houses in the heart of the city; but when I saw
   the man, I could detect at a glance that it was not his nature to
   choose anything less free, pleasant, and cheery than those suburban
   streets, and their modern, sunny houses.

   I did not venture to call upon this eminent man for the mere
   gratification of a natural curiosity, but for the purpose of
   ascertaining one or two facts which I needed for a note to Ritter's
   work on the Holy Land, which I was then editing and translating. As
   Ritter had been a near and valued friend of Tischendorf, it was a
   matter of great satisfaction to the latter that an American had
   proposed to give to the people of England and the United States a
   version of the works of that great and excellent man; and no welcome
   could be more cordial than Tischendorf extended. He is by no means the
   old, smoke-dried, bad-mannered, garrulous, ill-dressed, and offensively
   dirty man, who often answers in Germany to the title of Professor. On
   the contrary, Tischendorf is a man looking young and florid, though
   probably hard upon sixty. I have seen many a man of forty whose face is
   more worn, and whose air is older, than that of this greatest of German
   scholars. Nor has he at all that shyness which a life in the study is
   almost sure to engender; he is free, open, genial, and has the manner
   of a gentleman who has traveled largely, and who is thoroughly familiar
   with society. And if there is more than a tinge of vanity in his talk,
   if he does not weary of speaking of his own works, his own exploits,
   his own hopes and purposes and successes, we only feel that he can not
   praise himself more than the world is glad to praise him, and that all
   the eulogies which he passes upon himself are no more hearty than those
   which all the great scholars of the age have lavished upon him.

   Tischendorf, like all really great men, is as approachable as a child,
   and is not obliged to confine his conversation to learned subjects. He
   does not speak English at all, but will give his English or American
   visitor the choice of five languages,--Greek, Latin, Italian, French,
   and German. In all of these he is at home, speaking the first four not
   in any stiff, pedantic way, but with grace and fluency. Yet he loves
   best his mother tongue, of course. In talking, his countenance lights
   up pleasantly, his style becomes sprightly, his action vivacious, he
   jumps up, runs across the room to fetch a book or document or
   curiosity, enters into his guest's affairs, speaks warmly of friends,
   and evidently enjoys with great zest his foreign reputation. Of two
   Americans he spoke with great warmth,-- Prof. H. B. Smith of New York,
   and Prof. Day of New Haven. His relations with the great English
   scholars and divines are very intimate; and archbishops and deans and
   civil dignitaries of the highest rank are proud to enjoy the friendship
   of this great and genial German scholar.

   Tischendorf gave me with his own lips the account, which in its printed
   form [1] is so well known, of his discovery of the ancient Sinaitic
   Bible. He told me of his three separate journeys to the convent at the
   foot of Mount Sinai in search of ancient manuscripts; of the bringing
   to light, at his first visit, of large fragments of the Bible as well
   as of valuable, apocryphal documents; of his discovery in 1853, at his
   second visit, of only eleven additional lines from the book of Genesis;
   of the obstacles put in his way, the great liberality of the Russian
   government, the help afforded him by eminent princes, and the success
   which finally attended him, when, in the autumn of 1859, he was able to
   return from Cairo to St. Petersburg and lay the original manuscript of
   the Sinaitic Bible in the hands of the Emperor of Russia. It is one of
   the oldest written documents extant; dating back to the fourth century,
   about the time of the first Christian Emperor. No wonder that the night
   on which Tischendorf made this great discovery he was unable to sleep
   for joy, and danced in his room for very excitement.

   Have any of my readers ever read Freytag's masterly romance entitled
   "The Lost Manuscript"? It seems to me that he has embodied in this
   work, which is one of the finest products of German genius, very much
   of the feeling which such men as Tischendorf experience in pursuing
   such investigations, and in coming to such results as this. But more
   momentous by far in its relations to the human race is the search for
   an ancient Bible than that for a lost Tacitus; the one the record of a
   nation's decline and ruin, the other the promise of a world's
   restoration!

   During our interview, Prof. Tischendorf told me that he was then
   re-writing his work "When were our Gospels written?" making it a book
   for scholars instead of for popular readers, and enlarging it to three
   times its original size. He believed that both works were needed, in
   England and America no less than in Germany, and suggested to me to
   undertake the translation of the larger work. I promised to do so at my
   earliest leisure, and the result is now before the public. The name of
   the work I have ventured to change. In the German it bears the same
   title with the smaller sketch, "When were our Gospels written?" but
   fearing lest some should suppose that the two books are almost
   identical, merely different issues of the same work, it has seemed no
   violence to give the treatise the name, "Origin of the Four Gospels."
   The learned author has not succeeded in throwing his materials together
   in a way to attract hasty readers; his style is in this work rather
   heavy, hard, and disjointed; but great, invaluable facts are there; and
   there is no lack of a clear, well-poised, thoroughly guarded critical
   judgment, sound faith, and earnest purpose. If our Christian public at
   large have reason to be grateful for the publication of the little work
   of Tischendorf, our clergymen, theological students, and professors
   have no less cause to thank the great Leipzig scholar for furnishing
   them with this armory of bright, keen weapons to be employed in the
   overthrow of unbelief.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE.

   WHEN in January, 1865, I set my hand to the task of preparing a work
   which should solve for the satisfaction of cultivated readers no less
   than of thorough scholars the question of the genuineness of our
   Gospels,--a question which stands related in the closest manner to the
   great topic of the present age, the Life of Jesus,--I was fully aware
   that those theologians who have for some time brought the scourge of
   their skeptical and unbelieving theories upon the field of
   New-Testament scholarship would take great offense at my work, and
   express themselves strongly against it. For who does not know that
   these men have long forgotten how to subject their prejudices to the
   results of conscientious investigation? Equally well known is it that
   they are accustomed to regard nothing as having scholarly and
   scientific value unless it proceeds from their own circle. On my part,
   however, I felt it to be my duty to take up arms against this organized
   movement to convert theological science into sophistry, and give
   powerful support to the anti-Christian spirit of our time; to meet it
   with the results of rigid inquiry, and with the earnestness of
   convictions which have matured from a lifetime consecrated faithfully
   to Christian learning. It seemed to be only in this way that I could
   advance the sacred interests which I had at heart, and throw light upon
   the questions which are vitally connected with belief in the Lord.

   Did I expect to escape contradiction and the anger of opponents? By no
   means. Others might hesitate about committing themselves absolutely to
   a service in behalf of the interests of truth, fearing to encounter the
   sharp thrusts which might be directed against them; but I believed that
   I ought to and must cherish no such fear, and solaced myself with the
   thought that it would be a hard matter if what I might suffer from the
   calumny of enemies were not offset by the approbation of those who
   believe in the purity of my intentions and the uprightness of my aim. I
   have not been disappointed in this. The displeasure of my opponents has
   been manifested in a shameless manner. But, on the other hand, there
   has not been wanting the satisfaction of seeing my little book received
   in many quarters with the warmest acceptance and heartiest recognition,
   as well out of Germany as in it. In France, Holland, England, Russia,
   and America, translations have appeared; even an Italian one was made
   at Rome. Yet opposition has at no single moment failed to display its
   real character; the weapons of lying, persecution, and calumny have
   been brought to bear against me; and in so doing, the blind zeal which
   has been displayed has at times suffered the grossest ignorance to peep
   out.

   Two men in particular have undertaken the task of assailing my work
   with the weapons mentioned above,--Dr. Hilgenfeld, of Jena, and Dr.
   Volkmar, of Zurich. The first has devoted to this task an article in
   the Review which he edits, heading it, "Constantine Tischendorf as
   Defensor Fidei." As examples of the disingenuous statements with which
   he figures [strotzt], I adduce the following. Although in my work my
   main task was with the canon of the four Gospels; although I in no
   place undertook to put the whole New-Testament canon on the same
   footing, as, indeed, no thorough scholar can do; and although I do not
   speak specifically of the whole canon, and merely put together as of
   equal canonicity the four Gospels, the Pauline Epistles, the first of
   John, and the first of Peter, yet Hilgenfeld writes, p. 330: "The
   cheering result which issues from this illustration of the subject is
   the fact that the four Gospels, and even the whole canon of the New
   Testament, can be assigned to the close of the first century." Page
   333: "Than the presupposition that the close of the New-Testament canon
   falls at the end of the first century, nothing is more incompatible."
   Page 336: "The modern apologist, who puts a full and fair ending of the
   New-Testament canon at the close of the first century." Is this
   legerdemain, or a purposed misleading of readers? It is, it must be,
   one of the two. Naturally, he shuns quoting a single passage of my work
   in support of the charge which he brings against me. [2]

   Page 333, note 2, Hilgenfeld, in commenting on Euseb. Hist. Eccl. iii.
   392, and alluding to Papias, thus writes: "That the line of presbyters
   is opened here by the apostles, can only be more than doubtful with a
   critic like Tischendorf." But would any reader suspect from this that I
   was following the express declaration of Eusebius, to whom we are
   indebted for almost all our knowledge of Papias's book, and to whose
   silence the negative school itself is indebted for its powerful
   evidence against John? And that the "Defensor Fidei" is here in accord
   with the two heroes of the negative school--Strauss and Renan has not
   the third hero of that school ignored this, or sought to whitewash it
   over?

   On page 337, Hilgenfeld writes: "The 'honorable weapons' on which
   Tischendorf prides himself are, for that matter, made very doubtful
   even in the homilies of Clemens Romanus." On this, he proceeds to quote
   my words [in the first edition of this book]: "It is of unabated
   interest that the alleged and acutely argued cropping out of John's
   Gospel in this celebrated record of the Jewish-Christian tendency,
   based on the recent discovery by Dressel, at Rome, of the closing
   portion of the document, where there is an undoubted use of John's
   story of the man whose blindness was healed,--though it may be that the
   genial habit of skepticism will yield to no array of truth,--has
   entirely fallen out of sight." On this, he remarks: "As I, to whose
   critical investigations into the Gospels of Justin a note at this point
   refers, do not wish to hold Dr. Tischendorf to be a base calumniator, I
   must conclude that he has taken a twelve-years' slumber over the matter
   with which he is dealing. Dressel's complete edition of Clemens's
   Homilies, published in 1853, is for Tischendorf a book only 'just out.'
   Then he rubs his eyes, and simply comes to the same conclusion that I
   came to fifteen years ago, before the conclusion of the Homilies was
   brought to light." To this I answer, that my allusion to Hilgenfeld was
   coupled with the expression "acutely argued," and that it was expressly
   stated that Hilgenfeld's words dated from 1850; and when I had occasion
   to speak of Dressel's work as "new," I appended the date, 1853. Still
   some trace of his base calumniation must remain. And Hilgenfeld draws
   my own words, "Though it may be that the genial habit of skepticism
   will yield to no array of truth," down upon his own head. A glance
   shows that he is entitled to the full application of it; and one may
   not hear of the "genial habit of skepticism" without seeing that Dr.
   Hilgenfeld is alluded to. He acts as if he did not know that it is Dr.
   Volkmar who has so weakened his confession of a use of John's Gospel by
   the Clementines that the doubts respecting the authenticity of this
   Gospel remain undisturbed; and he writes: "But Tischendorf, although an
   honorable man in everything else, has in this instance been buried,
   with his critical knowledge, in the deepest slumber." Everywhere
   Hilgenfeld acts as if he believed that all that he advances must be
   contested by me. I did not purpose to take him for the subject of my
   book: he comes, as all can see, only under consideration so far as he
   follows in the direction which I oppose. Does he leave this direction
   at any point, and under any circumstances, he begins to cry out about
   "dishonor," "going to sleep," "Spanish knight-errantry," and the like,
   as in page 336, where says, "In him (Justin) I have long recognized the
   use of the three first Gospels, and even the possibility of an
   acquaintance with the fourth. This puts Tischendorf in the attitude of
   spurring his Rosinante, Don Quixote-like, against windmills as imagined
   giants, in his zeal to show the use of the four Gospels by these
   apologists." The zeal of the Spanish knight lies in the following
   forcible words: "That Justin repeats our Matthew in many passages is
   undeniable; that he knows and follows Mark and Luke, is in several
   places extremely probable." [3] Then a page and a half are devoted to a
   discussion of the effort which has been made to discredit this
   universally accredited result: as much more follows respecting the use
   of John, neither exactly answering to Hilgenfeld's views about fighting
   against windmills. Looking back at his loose statements, specimens of
   which have here been given, and more familiar with the discovery of his
   dishonesty, the same pitiable "Theologus quem terrestres certe superi
   . . . extra ordinem theologicum arcuerunt" writes in his "N. T. extra
   canonem receptum," "Ceterum Tischendorfii argumenta qualia omnino sint
   iam diiudicavi et huius viri subdolam in impugnandis adversariis
   rationem palam detexi." In the same work he boldly continues the flow
   of his dishonest effusions, writing on page 69, "Tischendorfium in
   famoso libello." . . . Page 44: "Calumniatoris partes agere, quasi
   negaremus Matth. evang. h. 1. laudari nemo non videt." But what is on
   that page 44 to which he refers? Not a word respecting him; I only
   transcribed verbally what Volkmar wrote, where he prefaced his
   invectives against myself and others with the applause which he had
   received from Hilgenfeld and Strauss: "quod Ed. mea Esdræ Prophetæ;
   . . . omnibus qui hucusque de ea re ex Ed. mea iudicarunt persuasit,
   etiam Hilgenfeldio; . . . et Straussio. . . . Reussium satis pigebit."
   Is not this to wear without shame the liar's brazen brow?

   But Dr. Volkmar has surpassed even Hilgenfeld in the use of these
   weapons. I had occasion to show in my book, by a number of examples,
   that a great many trickeries had been employed for the purpose of
   discrediting the evidence borne by the second century to our Gospels.
   This evidence was in part put aside, where it could be, by bringing
   forward the testimony of lost writings; sometimes the witnesses were
   made more modern than they really were, and transformed from a decisive
   epoch to one without significance, so far as the matter under
   discussion is affected, while sometimes they were charged with
   ignorance or deceit: here the writings which gave evidence were
   regarded as not genuine, or at any rate as interpolated so far as to
   invalidate their testimony; while there the sentiments of ancient
   writers have all their pith taken out by falsification and perversion.
   All this is. effected by Volkmar with a skill that is unparalleled, so
   far as my modest knowledge enables me to judge. I ought not to refrain
   from giving some instances of his ways of proceeding. In respect to
   Herakleon, he writes, page 28: "Tischendorf states, 'This man was
   reckoned by Origen as contemporaneous with Valentine, which is
   confirmed by Epiphanius.' Yes, good God; [4] but if this is made out,
   why waste another word upon it?" On page 130: "Far from belonging to
   the earlier disciples of Valentine, he is one of the very last
   distinguished heads of that Gnosticism, and one who would recommend it
   to the Church: c. 190-195 on Luke, and c. 200-220 on John." Now, on
   what does this assertion rest? First: "Origen only declares that
   Herakleon was accounted to be the friend of Valentine;" page 23.
   Second: "He was the chief opponent of the school of Valentine, unknown
   even to Irenæus;" page 210. Third: "This is confirmed by Epiphanius
   because diadechetai, in his language, only refers to the fact that the
   Half-Valentinians are followed in chap. 41 by the founder of
   Marcionitism in this, my Panarion of all heresies." But with all this,
   he has sought in vain to falsify history. Following the lead of Dr.
   Lipsius, [5] whose heresiological investigations Volkmar boasts that he
   has only continued with the greatest satisfaction to himself, he
   overlooks the passage in Irenæus, Book ii. ch. 4 (not alluded to [6] in
   the index indeed), where Herakleon and Ptolemy are distinctly mentioned
   as well-known personages. Having made this unfortunate oversight, he
   advances confidently to weaken the force of gnorimos in Origen, to
   explain the diadechetai of Epiphanius in a joking fashion, and, lastly,
   to unearth in the zeteitosan of Hippolytus a contemporary of Hippolytus
   between 200 and 220. Celsus encountered a similar fate. Respecting him,
   Volkmar writes, page 80: "Of Celsus's work, it is notorious that it
   manifested acquaintance not only with the canonical, but with the
   apocryphal Gospels, and more particularly with that of John." "It is
   quite another matter to determine the epoch of Celsus." "Celsus wrote
   his book about the middle of the second century." "Does not Origen say,
   at the close of his work, 8: 76, that this Celsus announced that he was
   intending to put forth another writing of positive character, and that
   we must wait to see whether he should accomplish his purpose? Does not
   this look as if he were a contemporary of Origen's? . . . What Baur has
   incontestably demonstrated, that the New Platonist opponent of Origen
   was contemporaneous with him, is not simply ignored by this
   Tischendorf, the appealer to the ignorant multitude; it is absolutely
   unknown to him." But the argument brought forward by Volkmar rests on
   nothing less than a falsification of the words of Origen; yet such a
   step could only be taken by a scholar of his rare attainments, who had
   neglected to read what Origen says expressly with regard to Celsus,
   that "he had long been dead." In both cases, therefore, in that of
   Celsus as well as in that of Herakleon, there must be a choice in the
   means of cure; at any rate, to those which have been applied there must
   also be joined the excision of the passage in Irenæus and Origen. And
   is it not possible that the same Old Catholic critic (found out by
   Ritschl) who had partly invented and partly interpolated Ignatius's
   letters and those bearing his name, and who at the same time tricked
   out the Epistle of Polycarp with passages from Ignatius and Ignatius's
   Epistles, may have had his hand in this matter as well? That which
   personally touches me in these outpourings of theological bitterness is
   of very little consequence compared with two other elements of the
   document under consideration,--the frivolous tone of its scientific
   pretensions and the treachery to the church which it displays. For my
   own part, I can only hold it as an honor to thoroughly displease such
   men; and that my work has not entirely failed in reaching its mark, is
   proved to me in no more effective way than by the calumnious assaults
   which are made upon it; and so far as they have tried to blacken over
   what I have done, I freely pardon them, so far as roughness and want of
   understanding are concerned: there would be a valid token that I had
   failed in what I proposed were I not the target for the unthankfulness
   of mockers. But for the falseness which treads church and knowledge
   alike under foot; for that hypocritical frivolousness, which degrades
   the church into a mere seminary for the propagation of untruth, and
   elevates pure figments of the brain to the rank of apostolical
   inheritances, I have nothing but a cry of pain and of horror.

   Only a few words regarding the new edition of my work. The first
   edition, published in March, 1865, was followed in May by the second;
   the third aimed at a greater popularizing of the subject, and was
   accompanied by an historical sketch of my travels and researches. [7]
   It now seems advisable to add many details to that edition, and to make
   an effort to make the work more complete and valuable. To do this, I
   have more than doubled the amount of matter. Of course it has been my
   wish, in doing this, not to injure the work, so far as its tone is
   suited to meet the wants of the general world of culture, although it
   is hard to produce a book for this class, and at the same time to adapt
   it to the wants of special students. I must beg the reader's
   indulgence, should I be found at times to have given one body of
   readers undue advantage over another. I have written nothing which I am
   not prepared fully to defend. And may the blessing of God not be
   wanting to my little work in its new form.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [2] Hilgenfeld's friends are more outspoken in this matter than even he
   is, while they completely echo his words. Thus Volkmar, p. 110: "The
   Sinaitic Bible is asserted to have no greater value or significance
   than to make certain the fact that the canon of our four Gospels, as
   well as the whole Old Catholic New Testament, was in existence at the
   commencement of the second century." P. 120: "This which has been added
   is, therefore, a ne plus ultra; in this phrase, scriptum est, are
   involved not only the canonicity of Matthew, but the fourfoldness of
   our Gospels, and the authenticity of the whole New Testament." In like
   tone A. Ritschl, in the Jahrb. für deutsch. Theol. 1866, 2d pt. p. 355:
   "But it is arbitrarily foisted upon the words of the heresiarch, as it
   is also an arbitrary supposition, that the church from the apostolic
   time down was furnished with the canon of the New Testament, and with
   bishops who were the successors of the apostles. And whoever trusts
   Tertullian so far as the former statement is concerned, has no right to
   refuse to recognize with him the apostolical succession of bishops. As
   all the studies of Tischendorf into the history of the canon lead him
   to believe that no one of the New Testament Scriptures can be looked at
   by itself and as destitute of canonical authority" [these words are
   intended to convey the meaning that the canonization of Matthew,
   testified to by Barnabas, is to be confined to Matthew alone. That they
   signify no less than that the beginning of a canon of the New Testament
   can not be limited to a single document, can be clearly seen in the
   passage cited, and is there fully dwelt upon; the ascribing of another
   meaning is a perversion of my words], "and as he finds himself obliged
   to assign the establishment of the canon to the close of the first
   century . . . . If, now, it is a result to be almost envied that one
   should convince himself so easily of the correctness of his judgment
   respecting the history of the New Testament canon, they seem to be much
   more to be envied who want to confirm this result by holding firmly to
   the doctrine of an apostolical appointment of bishops who had authority
   commensurate with that of the apostles." These last words are a mere
   stupid joke, and are to be accounted as such; they are, therefore, of
   the same character, and are animated by the same spirit, as that which
   has caused other men to heap calumny upon me.

   [3] I might perhaps repel the charge that an over-heated zealous
   activity, akin to that of the Spanish knight-errant, lies dormant in my
   words, by citing the expression of the "Wiener Allgem. Literatur
   Zeitung zunächst für das katholische Deutschland, No. 25: "So far as
   real learning and familiarity with the subject are concerned, Strauss
   compared with Tischendorf is a pigmy by a giant." . . . One word of his
   weighs more than the whole book of another, however carefully
   prepared."

   [4] A familiar oath used by German divines, ladies, and other persons,
   and only less common than the hourly-repeated" Lord Jesus." Trans.

   [5] Zur Quellenkritik des Epiphanios, 1865, p. 68: "Herakleon does not
   specifically mention Irenæus." P. 168: "Epiphanios did not find the
   name of Herakleon mentioned in Irenæus, but he unquestionably learned
   of Hippolytus what he knew about him." "Even the order is given by
   Irenæus. And just because he does not mention Herakleon, Epiphanios
   thinks that he must put him behind Mark."

   [6] This may do something toward clearing away the charge which has
   often been brought against me, that I have not read Justin and others,
   and merely copy what I find in "Introductions."

   [7] The small, popular edition of this work has already been published
   in France by the Toulouse Société des livres religieux, in England by
   the Religious Tract Society, and in America. In the latter country a
   German edition has also been issued. The French translator is Prof.
   Sardinoux of Montauban, the English translator Mr. J. B. Heard, and the
   American, Prof. H. B. Smith.

   THE life of Jesus has become the center of the religious controversies
   which agitate our age. The importance of this fact is great. At its
   foundation lies the confession that Christianity is not grounded so
   much on the doctrines of Him from whom it receives its name as upon his
   person. Every acceptation of the word Christianity which is
   antagonistic to this confession, disowns the real character of the
   term, and rests on a misconception. The person of Jesus is the
   corner-stone on which the church bases its foundations; to it the
   doctrine of Jesus and of his disciples always and with the utmost
   distinctness points; with the person of Jesus Christianity stands or
   falls. To rob this person of his greatness,--of that greatness which
   the entire church ascribes to him under the name Son of God,--and yet
   to think to retain the Christian faith and the Christian church, is a
   futile attempt, a vain mockery. Even the morality which some might hope
   to rescue from the general shipwreck of faith is weakened by the
   unavoidable and remorseless contradictions which arise; for if the
   morality is sound, it must be a good tree growing from a diseased root.
   The life of Jesus is the most momentous of all questions which the
   church has to encounter,--the one which is decisive whether it shall or
   shall not live.

   Whence do we derive our knowledge of the life of Jesus? Almost
   exclusively from our four Gospels, in which the divine person of Jesus,
   the center of the Christian belief, and the main object too of all
   attacks upon it, is presented in essentially the same light as in the
   Epistles of Paul, unquestionably the oldest of all the apostolical
   documents. All else that we know of him is confined to a few
   expressions and acts, and, with unimportant exceptions, is in direct
   connection with, and dependence on, the Gospels. By far the most of
   these sources are to be found in apocryphal, i.e. not genuine,
   untrustworthy fragments, not bearing the true names of their authors,
   and aiming with more or less skill to supplement and complete the
   gospel narrative; others, partly of Jewish and partly of heathen
   origin, avow at the very outset the intention of assailing the Gospels.
   Finally, we possess in two classic writers of the first and the two
   following centuries, Tacitus and Pliny, a few incidental expressions
   which have a lasting interest: the first [8] testifying that Christ,
   the founder of the religion which had gained so strong a hold even in
   Nero's time, had been punished with death by the procurator Pontius
   Pilate during the reign of Tiberius; while Pliny asserts [9] in a
   communication to Trajan that the Christians, already a numerous body in
   Bithynia, were in the habit of singing songs of praise to Christ as to
   a God. [10] Our Gospels therefore, if not the only authorities relative
   to the life of Jesus, are by all odds the most important ones, and the
   only direct sources that are in existence. If then the life of Jesus is
   only made known to us by the Gospels, if we are directed to these books
   for the solution of all our questions about the birth, the activities,
   the conversation, character, and fortunes of Jesus, we have of course
   no less weighty an inquiry before us than this, Whence spring our
   Gospels? For upon the origin of these books hinge their trustworthiness
   and all their value.

   So much depending upon this first step, very many are the
   investigations which have been made in these modern times into the
   origin of the Gospels. It has been a question with what justice the
   names of those prominent members of the twelve, Matthew and John, and
   the names of the helpers and followers, Mark and Luke, have been
   assigned to the four Gospels. Just so far as the authorship of these
   documents has been admitted as due to those revered men, the Gospels
   have been accepted as authentic and trustworthy records of the life of
   the Lord. Their names have been regarded as a satisfactory guaranty
   that, in the writings with which they were coupled, truth only could be
   sought, that in them truth only was wished, and that in them truth was
   authentically recorded. There is indeed another way of testing the
   reliability of the Gospels. After the rise of the rationalizing or
   rationalistic spirit, and when the attempt was made to set the reason
   of man above everything which had previously borne the name of Divine
   Revelation, hands were laid at once on the biblical miracles, and it
   was claimed that they must be explained by the light of the imperfect
   culture of that time, and the incorrect appreciation of the Old
   Testament. Out of this grew the theory of accommodation, as it was
   called, which asserted that Jesus made his words chime in with the
   expectations of his age, and that he gave himself out to be a more
   important personage than he really was. This theory of the rise of the
   Gospels has culminated in the piece of botchwork which issued from the
   Paris press in 1863. The author of that book, not troubling himself
   with any speculations respecting the share which the apostles may have
   had in delineating the gospel portraits, but following his own
   self-imposed theories about miracles and revelation, has displayed
   boundless recklessness and given way to the most unbridled phantasies
   respecting the gospel history, caricaturing both it and its hero. He
   has written a book which has much more the character of a shameless
   calumny of Jesus than of an honest investigation into his career. Can
   we apply the term historical inquiry to an attempt to show [11] that
   John wrote the fourth Gospel out of a spirit of self-love, not without
   jealousy of Peter, [12] and full of hatred to Judas Iscariot? [13] Can
   we dignify by so high a term as scientific investigation such a theory
   as his respecting the cause of the sympathy felt for Jesus by the wife
   of Pilate, that she saw the "gentle Galilean," the "fine-looking young
   man," from a window of the palace that looked out on the temple-court,
   and that in consequence the thought that his blood was to be spilled
   rested like a mountain load upon her soul? [14] To cite one or two more
   examples of his mode of dealing with the Gospels, what shall we say of
   his manner of treating the raising of Lazarus, where he endeavors to
   show that Jesus, whose role was becoming more and more difficult every
   day, practiced an involuntary piece of deception upon the people and
   the credulous sisters of Lazarus? His theory is that the latter, while
   still sick, caused himself to be laid out for burial, and deposited in
   the family vault; that Jesus, wishing to see his friend once more,
   caused the tomb to be opened, and on seeing Lazarus come forth was
   himself led to believe that the dead man had come to life again,--the
   power of resuscitating him, meanwhile, being ascribed by the witnesses
   to the wonderful gifts of Jesus. [15] Or what shall we say of a theory
   of the conflict in Gethsemane, [16] which seeks to throw light on the
   Saviour's grief by such words as these: "Perhaps his thoughts were
   running back to the clear springs of Galilee where he had often found
   refreshment, to the vine-stock and the fig-tree beneath whose shade he
   had rested, to the young maidens who it may be had responded to his
   love. Did he curse his hard fate, which denied him all the old joys of
   his life? Did he lament his high call, and weep, a sacrifice on the
   altar of his own greatness, that he had not continued to be a simple
   Nazarene artisan?" [17] What shall we think of the supposition that the
   dreary landscape of Judæa--with Jerusalem, the sacred center of the
   Jewish faith and worship--drove the thoughts of the Galilean to the
   luxuriance of his own country's hills, and added to his grief? [18]
   What shall we say of his exclamation, that if a better understanding of
   Christianity is to prevail among men, and the apocryphal shrines which
   now claim veneration are to be superseded by authentic ones, the
   temple, the great church for all Christians, is to be built upon the
   hill of Nazareth,-- the soil beneath which are sleeping the carpenter
   Joseph and thousands of Nazarenes? [19] What shall we say to the
   crudest of all Renan's vagaries, the investing with the crown of
   immortality and the glittering halo of a saint the head of that Jew
   dying on the cross, at the outset a mere kindly poetical enthusiast,
   and at last an idolizing fanatic, involved irretrievably with the
   dominant party, and rushing willingly into the arms of death? [20]

   Surely it requires no further citations to justify the expression of a
   condemnation of Renan's book: these few instances are sufficient to put
   the reader in possession of materials adequate to enable him to judge
   of the character of the work. That, in spite of its frivolous pretenses
   to science, in spite of its fantastic caricatures of history, it has
   found such favor and endorsement in Germany, only shows how widely are
   diffused, even in Germany, the lack of sound criticism, and of
   acquaintance with biblical history, as well as the depraved taste of an
   age which is sunk in unbelief.

   In this matter, German science and scholarship have subjected
   themselves to a severe reproach. Not only is the prevalent rationalism,
   which places our common human reason above a divine revelation, and so
   sets aside the supernatural claims of the Gospels, a product of this
   French book, but German zeal is aroused, as well, to supply what is
   lacking of scientific accuracy in Renan's work, and to make his results
   more trustworthy. And so we have one of the frightful spectacles of our
   time,--French levity and German learning reaching brotherly hands to
   each other over the fresh grave of the Saviour. Unbelief, it would
   seem, gives even more strength than belief.

   In those quarters where regard is paid to historical authority, one of
   the points brought into the foreground in the attacks upon the
   authenticity of the Gospels, is the lack of early evidence that they
   were in existence at the opening of the Christian era. Nor can any one
   deny that this objection, if it can be maintained, is entitled to much
   weight. If it is as late as the year 150, or still later, that we
   receive the first tidings about John's Gospel, who. would not find it
   hard to believe that it was written by the beloved disciple of the Lord
   a half century before? If there is not in our possession evidence in
   support of the other Gospels dating from that time, or from the years
   just preceding it, who can deny that it does not raise doubts
   respecting their authenticity? It is true, we must take into account
   the paucity of the literature which comes down to us from the earlier
   epoch of the church; and besides, many a good book might have been
   written without verbally incorporating or directly using our Gospels;
   especially at a time when those who had been eye-witnesses had not been
   long dead; when the life of the churches was directly sustained by the
   spirit of the Gospels; and when the written letter had not begun to be
   dominant over the living evangel. If these considerations diminish the
   importance which might be attached to the absence of biblical
   quotations in the primitive Christian literature, yet it is clear, on
   the other hand, that if such quotations are really to be found there,
   the manifest acquaintance which they might show that men had with the
   Gospels in the first half of the second century must be of the greatest
   weight in establishing their age, their apostolical origin, and their
   genuineness. And therefore it is a sacred duty that those who would
   subject the authenticity of our Gospels to a thorough scrutiny, should
   make one of their chief duties a most careful investigation into the
   most ancient sources of testimony respecting the existence and the
   recognized credibility of the records of Jesus' life.

   It seems to me that this duty has been by no means faithfully enough
   most for the first three so-called synoptical Gospels, and still less
   for that of John, whose want of authenticity has been inscribed in
   flaming letters upon the banners of the negative school. The writer of
   these lines imposes upon himself the task of trying to throw some light
   upon the authority of the evangelical documents, although in preparing
   the work not for special students, but cultivated Christians generally,
   it may not be possible to enter so exhaustively into the subject as
   under other circumstances might be desirable.

   We can make as our starting-point the unquestioned fact that in the
   last decades of the second century our four Gospels were known and
   acknowledged in all portions of the church. Irenæus, from 177 on,
   Bishop of Lyons, where the first Christian church of Gaul was
   established, wrote a great work in the last decades of the second
   century, directed at the earliest heresies, the Gnostic, and on every
   page made use of the Gospels, providing himself from them with
   materials to overthrow a system which was threatening to destroy the
   doctrines of the church. The number of passages where he has recourse
   to the Gospels is about four hundred, and about eighty of these contain
   quotations from John. From the closing decade of the second century on,
   the able and learned Tertullian lived and labored at Carthage, in
   Africa, and in his numerous writings there exist hundreds of citations
   from the text of the Gospels, which he made use of as his most decisive
   authorities. The same is true of Clemens, the celebrated teacher in the
   school of catechumens at Alexandria, about the end of the second
   century. Nor must I fail to allude to a catalogue, generally known by
   the name of its discoverer, the Italian scholar, Muratori, of all the
   books which were regarded as canonical in the very earliest times. This
   work was probably prepared at Rome, and shortly after the time of the
   Roman bishop Pius, i. e. somewhere where between 160 and 170. In this
   catalogue of the books thus reckoned as comprising the New Testament,
   the four Gospels are at the head. [21] It is true, the first few lines
   which relate to Matthew and Mark have been lost; but, at the close of
   the still extant words respecting the latter, the Gospel of Luke is
   spoken of as the third, and that of John as the fourth; enabling us to
   see that even in the very earliest days the order was followed with
   which we are so familiar.

   I have thus summoned witnesses from Gaul, from proconsular Africa (the
   present Algiers), from Alexandria, and from Rome. Two others can be
   cited fitly here, although one of them goes back to a remoter date: I
   mean the two oldest translations from the Greek text used by the
   apostles themselves. One of these is the Syriac version, and bears the
   name Peshito; the other is the Latin version, known under the title
   Itala: both of them give the four Gospels the first place. The
   canonical acceptance of all four must unquestionably have been general,
   as we see that they were transferred openly, and as a whole, into the
   language of the newly-converted Christians, the Latins and Syrians. The
   Syriac translation, which takes us to the neighborhood of the
   Euphrates, is almost universally assigned to the end of the second
   century; and, although positive proofs are wanting in support of this
   date, yet we are not without good grounds for accepting it. The Latin
   version, on the contrary, had begun to gain general recognition even
   before the end of the second century; for both Tertullian, in his
   quotations from Irenæus, and the Latin translator of Irenæus's great
   work against heresy, writing about the end of the second century, make
   use of the text of the Itala. This, of course, implies that the Latin
   translation was made some years before the close of the second century.
   I shall have occasion subsequently to allude again to the striking fact
   that it was necessary to translate the Gospels into Latin and Syriac as
   early as the second half of the second century, and that the number of
   documents was limited to the four with which we are now familiar.

   Looking a little more closely into the testimony of the two great
   Fathers, Irenæus and Tertullian, we have to ask, Can their evidence be
   so limited in its application as to only prove that the four Gospels
   were fully accepted in their day? Irenæus not merely invests these
   documents with entire authority in the citations which he makes to
   overthrow the Gnostic heretics; it even appears in his work that the
   Gospels, or rather, to use his own expression, the fourfoldness of the
   Gospel, has been conformed to the analogy of the four quarters of the
   globe, the four chief winds, the four faces of the cherubim. He asserts
   that the four Gospels are the four pillars of which the church rests as
   it covers the whole earth, and in this number four he recognizes a
   special token of the Creator's wisdom. [22] Is such a representation
   compatible with the fact that at the time of Irenæus the four Gospels
   first began to be accepted? or that an attempt was then being made to
   append a fourth and newer one to the three older ones then current? Is
   it not much more credible that the acceptance of all the four was then
   of so long standing and so thoroughly complete, that the Bishop of
   Lyons could allude to the fourfoldness of the Gospel as a thing
   universally recognized, and in consequence of this very recognition
   speak of it as a thing which harmonizes with great and unchanging
   cosmical relations? Irenæus died in the second year after the close of
   the second century, but in his youth he had sat at the feet of the
   venerable Polycarp, who had been a disciple of John the evangelist, and
   had been acquainted with many eyewitnesses of Jesus' life. In
   mentioning this fact Irenæus [23] alludes very tenderly to the
   statement of his revered teacher Polycarp, that all that he had heard
   from the lips of John and other disciples of Jesus coincided fully with
   the written account. Yet let us hear his own words as given in a letter
   to Florinus: "I saw you while I was yet a youth in Lower Asia with
   Polycarp, when you were living in scenes of princely splendor, and when
   you were striving to gain the approval of Polycarp. What took place
   then is fresher in my memory than what has occurred more recently. What
   we took in our youth grows up as it were with us, and is incorporated
   in us. And so I can even now bring back to mind just the place where
   the good Polycarp used to sit when he talked to us, how he looked as he
   came in and as he went out, how he lived, how he used to speak to the
   people, how he used to allude to his intercourse with John and repeat
   the words of others who had seen the Lord, how he used to recount what
   he had heard from their own lips about the miracles and the teachings
   of the Lord,--and all in full accordance with the written narrative."
   [24]

   Thus writes Irenæus respecting his intercourse with Polycarp and
   respecting the communications of Polycarp. The date of the young
   Irenæus's intercourse with the aged saint must be set approximately at
   about the year 150. Irenæus died in 202, according to old accounts a
   martyr, while Polycarp perished at the stake in 165, "1 after having,"
   to use his own expression, served the Lord eighty-six years." And is it
   to be believed that Irenæus never heard from his teacher, whose
   communications respecting John he expressly refers to, one word
   regarding the Gospel of John? Indisputably, one part of Polycarp's
   testimony relative to John's Gospel carries us back to John himself.
   For Polycarp's evidence respecting the work of his teacher must be
   based upon the testimony of his teacher himself. The case becomes all
   the more clear the more closely we look into it on the adversaries'
   side, and range ourselves with those who deny the validity of John's
   Gospel. According to this view, Polycarp, although saying so much to
   Irenæus regarding John, did not drop a word regarding the Gospel of
   John. But supposing he did not, is it credible that Irenæus fully
   accepted that Gospel, that work which seemed to be the noblest gift of
   John to Christianity, the report of an eye-witness respecting the life,
   death, and resurrection of the Saviour of the world, as a Gospel which
   ran directly counter to the testimony of the three other evangelists?
   Would not the very circumstance that Polycarp made no mention of it
   have convinced Irenæus of its want of authenticity? And yet it is
   asserted that in order to meet and overthrow false teachers, and the
   men who falsified the canon, he did not hesitate to reckon the Gospel
   of John as strictly embraced among the sacred books.

   This on which I am now laying stress is nothing new; it has long stood
   recorded on the pages of Irenæus, and has long been read there. But it
   has not had its due weight; else how could it have been so lightly
   passed over? For my own part I must completely justify the assigning of
   much greater weight, on the part of correct and thorough investigators,
   to the testimony of Polycarp and Irenæus respecting the Gospel of John,
   than to all the difficulties and all the objections urged by skeptical
   scholars.

   And is the case not similar with Tertullian and his testimony
   respecting the Gospel? This man, who had been transformed from a
   worldly heathen lawyer into a powerful advocate of divine truth, enters
   so critically into the question of the origin and relative value of the
   four Gospels as expressly to subordinate Mark and Luke to Matthew and
   John, on the ground that the former were mere helpers and companions of
   the apostles, while the latter were selected by the Lord himself and
   invested with full authority. [25] The same author propounds also an
   inexpugnable canon of historical criticism, a test of the truth of the
   early Christian documents, and especially those of apostolic origin, in
   that he makes the value of testimony dependent on the epoch of the
   witness, and demands that what was held as true in his day should be
   judged in the light of its prior acceptance. If it had been accepted
   before, it was fair to suppose that it had been equally accepted in the
   time of the apostles; its authenticity must therefore have been
   admitted by the apostolical church, founded as it was by the apostles
   themselves. [26] And is it to be believed that this acute man was
   capable of being deceived in his acceptance of the Gospels and in his
   defense of them by any thin web of sophistry or touch of charlatanism?
   The passages just referred to are taken from his celebrated reply to
   Marcion, who in a wanton and heretical spirit had impugned the
   authenticity of the Gospels. Three of the four he had wholly excluded,
   and of the fourth he retained only just so much as it pleased him to
   do. In replying to him, Tertullian expressly bases his argument on the
   ground that at the time when the apostolical church was founded all the
   four Gospels were accredited. Has such a statement no weight in the
   mouth of a man like Tertullian? When he wrote, scarcely a hundred years
   had elapsed since the death of John. At that date the testimony,
   appealed to by him, of the church at Ephesus, in which John had labored
   so long and amid which he had died, must have been full and decisive
   respecting the genuineness or spuriousness of John's Gospel. Nor was it
   a matter of any difficulty to ascertain what was the judgment which
   this church passed on the Gospel. And we must not overlook the fact
   that we have not to do, in this matter, with a scholar who is
   contenting himself with merely learned investigations, but with a man
   full of earnestness respecting his faith, and taking very seriously the
   question of human salvation. The Christian documents which asserted a
   connection between themselves and the origin of the new faith, the
   documents at which all the worldly wisdom of the time in which
   Tertullian himself was reared took offense,--were they likely to be
   accepted by him without inquiry, and in a blind credulity? And inasmuch
   as he expressly assures us that he bases his acceptation of all the
   four Gospels on the credit of the apostolical church, [27] is it not an
   unworthy suspicion, the doubting that he made thorough inquiry into the
   capacity of the apostolical church to pass an authentic judgment on the
   Christian documents?

   I insist therefore, to sum up the matter, that the testimony of Irenæus
   and Tertullian respecting the four Gospels is not to be taken as an
   isolated, unrelated fact, but that it must be considered as a valid
   result of all the historical evidence which was at their command. And
   how far we are justified in this, is shown not only by the authorities
   already adduced, the author of the Muratori list of New Testament
   books, the African translator of the Gospels into Latin, the originator
   of the Itala, but by all the other witnesses who lived prior to the
   time of Irenæus and Tertullian. Many of my readers are acquainted with
   the so-called Harmonies of the Gospels,--the works in which the four
   sacred narratives are co-ordinated into a single one. In this way an
   effort has been made to draw from the Gospels alone a closely followed
   and faithful portrait of our Lord's life, those points which one
   narrator has brought more prominently into view than the others being
   employed as supplementary to the other accounts, and a complete picture
   being the result. In these works the narrative of John has been drawn
   upon to supply the incidents occurring in the last three years of
   Jesus' life, and to follow his course step by step. Harmonies of this
   kind were prepared as early as the year 170 by two men whose names are
   known to us: one of them was Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch in Syria;
   the other was Tatian, a disciple of Justin the great theologian and
   martyr. [28] True, both of those works are lost; but Jerome speaks in
   the fourth century of the one prepared by Theophilus as still existing,
   describing it as a combination of the four Gospels in one continuous
   narrative; [29] respecting the second we have the testimony of Eusebius
   [30] and Theodoret, [31] the latter of whom speaks with intimate
   knowledge. Tatian himself alludes to his work as "the Gospel made up of
   four, the Diatessaron." Both of these men wrote other works which are
   still extant. In 180 and 181 Theophilus indited the three books to
   Autolycus, a learned heathen who had assailed Christianity. In this
   work are extracts from Matthew, Luke, and John. It is especially
   noteworthy that he cites the latter (ii. 22), alluding explicitly to
   the name of the author. His words are, "This is taught by the Holy
   Scriptures and all inspired men, among whom is John, who says, 'In the
   beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,' and then follows,
   'and the Word was God: all things were made by him, and without him was
   not anything made that was made."' This makes it certain that the
   Harmony of Theophilus embraced the Gospel of John. [32] The same is
   true of Tatian: for in his Addresses to the Heathen, a work filled with
   learning, and very decided in its tone, written probably between 166
   and 170, there are several passages quoted from John's Gospel, such as
   this: "The Light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it
   not. . . . . The Life was the Light of men. . . . . All things were
   made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made." From
   this it would seem certain that his Harmony, like that of Theophilus,
   although it may have taken some liberties with the order of the
   narrative, included the Gospel of John: and this chimes admirably with
   the statement of Bishop Bar Salibi, that the Diatessaron of Tatian,
   accompanied by a commentary by Ephraim, and thus discriminated from the
   Diatessaron of Ammonius, began with the words, "In the beginning was
   the Word."

   These Harmonies last mentioned, one of which must with much probability
   be ascribed to a date within the first sixty years of the second
   century, have far more worth than what would be gathered from single
   scattered extracts, for their preparation points back conclusively to a
   time when the four Gospels were already accepted as a perfect record,
   and when the necessity had begun to be felt of deducing a higher unity
   and a more harmonious completeness from them than the diversity of the
   various books and the apparent discrepancies had rendered apparent. If
   these efforts are to be assigned to a date as early as the second
   decade subsequently to the middle of the second century, it makes the
   inference a necessary one that the use and recognition of the four
   Gospels must be assigned to a much earlier date.

   Similar testimony we owe to a cotemporary of the two men just named,
   Claudius Apollinaris, Bishop of Hierapolis in Phrygia, whose epoch is
   assigned by Eusebius (iv. 26) to the reign of Marcus Aurelius. For in a
   fragment preserved in the Chronicon Paschale he declares that if the
   Quartodecimanians (so called from holding like the Jews that the
   fourteenth of Nisan was the day for celebrating the paschal sacrifice)
   appeal justly to Matthew in support of the view that Jesus partook of
   the last supper with his disciples at the precise time of celebrating
   the paschal offering, there must be an antagonism among the writers of
   the several Gospels. Now as in this contest Matthew, Mark, and Luke
   must be ranged on the one side, and John on the other, the words of
   Apollinaris indicate that all the Gospels were conceded in his day to
   have equal value. To this may be added that in one passage still extant
   in the same Chronicon there is undeniable reference to John's allusion
   (xix. 34) to the piercing of Jesus' side.

   According to Eusebius, the choice of Dionysius as Bishop of Corinth
   occurred in the year 170. The same historian has preserved for us
   (Euseb. iv. 23) some fragments of letters and other documents from the
   pen of Dionysius. To one church he sent in the epistolary form
   expositions of Scripture; and to the Romans he wrote, after
   animadverting severely upon the efforts to discredit the genuineness of
   his own letters, that it was not at all strange that men sought to
   discredit the Gospels, since these too were documents whose value was
   so great that their authenticity should be indisputable. The
   expression, Holy Scriptures, might not necessarily refer to the New
   Testament; but the word which Dionysius employs--writings respecting
   the Lord,--the same term which Clemens of Alexandria uses (Strom. vii.
   1)--has the same signification with the expression New Testament, and
   relates evidently to the books which were then accepted as constituting
   the New Testament canon.

   The Apology written by Athenagoras of Athens, in the year 177, contains
   several quotations from Matthew and Luke; it displays also unmistakable
   marks of being influenced by John's Gospel; as, for example, in the
   passages which speak of the Logos as the Word of God, and which allude
   to the Son of God who is in the Father as the Father is in the Son. It
   contains the very expression found in the first chapter of John, third
   verse, "All things were made by him," and in the seventeenth chapter,
   twenty-first verse, "as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee."

   I have taken these witnesses to the credibility of our Gospels from the
   epoch prior to Irenæus and Tertullian, and just at the threshold of the
   Irenæan period, the second and third decade after the middle of the
   second century. There are, however, left to us other witnesses much
   earlier, and, like those just quoted, men who speak to us right from
   the very bosom of the church. [33]

   Between the apostolic epoch and that which followed there intervene the
   so-called apostolic Fathers; for as direct disciples of the apostles
   they must be reckoned as in immediate connection with the apostolic
   age. If in the little which these men have left us we do not find
   anything which can be construed as definite testimony as to the
   authenticity of the Gospels, still we are not to conclude from their
   silence that the Gospels were not in existence before their time. But
   should there be in their writings a constant use of the Old Testament,
   and not the slightest use of the New, in spite of the fact that the
   latter lay so much nearer to hand, [34] the probability must be
   accepted as great that at that time the Gospels were not accepted as of
   equal weight with the Old Testament.

   And this appears to have been the case with the epistle of the Roman
   Clement, written in the second or third decade before the close of the
   first century, and about a decade after the destruction of Jerusalem.
   At that time no canon of the Gospels was in existence. It is indeed
   unquestionable that in his epistle, rich in quotations from the Old
   Testament, Clement refers here and there to passages [35] in the
   Pauline Epistles, which have indeed chronologically priority over the
   Gospels, though not in any other sense. [36]

   It is otherwise with those other constituents of this literature to
   whose discussion we now come,--the epistles of Ignatius and that of
   Polycarp. The first of these have reached us various in extent and
   variously edited. Three extant only in Latin are manifestly later
   additions to the older literature; and so too are five others, written
   in Greek, Latin, and Armenian, their authenticity being disowned by the
   fact that Eusebius makes no allusion to them. There are besides seven
   epistles, which are extant in a longer and a shorter form: of the
   longer one, there is also an ancient Latin version; of the shorter, a
   Latin version and Syriac, and Armenian ones as well. With this is to be
   joined the fact that twenty years ago a Syriac version of three of
   these seven epistles was discovered, more brief than the short Greek
   text. After the debate respecting the longer and the shorter epistles
   had been decisively settled in favor of the shorter, the question arose
   whether the three extant in the Syriac translation are not to be
   preferred to these seven shorter ones. When several scholars declared
   themselves in favor of this, others defended the earlier origin of the
   seven Greek epistles, insisting that the three in Syriac were a mere
   extract, intended for devotional uses. We hold this to be the more
   correct view. Similar occurrences are not unknown in the apocryphal
   writings of the New Testament. An extraordinary proof in this case is
   afforded by the circumstance that these seven epistles are not only
   recognized by Eusebius (iii. 36), but are alluded to in the letter of
   Polycarp. In order to escape the force of this testimony, the most
   decisive passage in the latter epistle, defended as it is by Eusebius
   himself, must be set aside as unauthentic. Besides this, the assigning
   of superior value to the three Syriac letters is invalidated by the
   fragmentary character of many passages; one is so manifestly an excerpt
   from the Greek text that it must be admitted that one section has been
   lost through the carelessness of the copyist. We claim the right,
   therefore, of holding to the authenticity of the seven epistles
   ascribed by Eusebius and Polycarp to Ignatius, and written while he was
   on the way from Antioch, through Smyrna and Troas, to his martyrdom at
   Rome. Examining them with reference to our present theme, we find
   several allusions to Matthew and John. Take this passage (letter to the
   Romans, chap. 6): "For what is a man profited if he shall gain the
   whole world and lose his own soul?" taken literally from Matt. xvi. In
   like manner, the passage in his epistle to the people of Smyrna, in
   which he asserts of Jesus that he was baptized by John in order that
   all righteousness might be fulfilled by him," reminds one of Matt. iii.
   15: "for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness." In the
   letter to the Romans (chap. 7), he writes, "I want the bread of God,
   the bread of heaven, the bread of life, which is the body of Jesus
   Christ the Son of God; . . . and I want the draught of God, the blood
   of Jesus, which is imperishable love and eternal life." Compare this
   with the sixth chapter of John, verse 41: "I am the bread which came
   down from heaven;" verse 48: "I am that bread of life;" verse 51: "And
   the bread that I will give is my flesh;" verse 54: "Whoso eateth my
   flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life." To the Philadelphians
   he writes (chap. 7), "What if some wished to lead me astray after the
   flesh? but the Spirit is not enticed; he is from God; he knows wherever
   he cometh and whither he goeth, and he brings to punishment that which
   is hidden." These verses have as their basis John iii. 6 to 8, [37]
   while the last clause grows out of the twentieth [38] verse. Were these
   allusions of Ignatius to Matthew and John a mere isolated phenomenon,
   and one which would be adverse to other points in this discussion on
   which no doubts rest, they would not have decisive weight. But so far
   from militating against other points of evidence, they are in full
   agreement with them, particularly in view of the fact that at the time
   when the letters were written, between 107, the date generally
   assigned, and 115, they contain references to two of the most important
   of the four Gospels.

   The letter of Polycarp to the Philippians connects itself most closely
   with those of Ignatius. According to his own testimony, it was written
   very soon after the martyrdom of Ignatius; that is, between 107 and
   115. It contains very brief quotations from Matthew, as, for example,
   in chap. 2: "Think on the Lord how he said, Judge not, that ye be not
   judged [Matt. vii. 1]. Forgive, and it shall be forgiven you [similar
   to Matt. vi. 14]. Be merciful, that you may obtain mercy [compare with
   Matt. v. 7]. And with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you
   again [a literal quotation from Matt. vii. 2]. And blessed are the
   poor, and they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake; for theirs
   is the kingdom of heaven" [taken almost verbatim from Matt. v. 3 and
   10]. Further, chap. 7: "We will implore the Omniscient God not to lead
   us into temptation, remembering the words of the Lord, The spirit is
   willing but the flesh is weak" [compare Matt. vi. 13 and xxvi. 41].
   Special weight must be ascribed to that passage in Polycarp's letter
   which clearly manifests the use of the First Epistle of John. Polycarp
   writes, chap. 7: "For every one who does not confess that Jesus Christ
   is come in the flesh is antichrist:" in John (iv. 3) the passage runs,
   "Every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the
   flesh is not of God; and this is that spirit of antichrist." The
   importance of this use by Polycarp of the Epistle of John is based upon
   this, that--although the heroes of doubt bring into suspicion even that
   which is really indisputable--the Epistle and the Gospel of John are
   shown, by their essential unity of incident and language, to have
   necessarily had the same author; and thus the use of the Epistle argues
   the use of the Gospel as well. I have shown above, from Polycarp's
   intimate relation to John, how valuable is his testimony: it has such
   great weight as scarcely to allow a word to be uttered in disavowal of
   the writings which he confirms. The unworthy skill of modern scholars
   has not shrunk, however, from setting aside the fact of Polycarp's
   testimony and unnerving its strength. A writer of much acuteness says,
   "We are not compelled to regard the words of Polycarp as an actual
   quotation from John, for that may have been a sentence which had come
   into circulation in the church, and may have been committed to paper by
   John just as well as by Polycarp, without compelling the latter to
   learn it from the former." Before this conjecture had been bruited, a
   fellow-believer had fallen upon another way out of the difficulty: "Can
   the thing not be reversed? May not the author of the Johannean Gospel,
   which is as little genuine as so much else that has for two thousand
   years received the reverent homage of Christendom,--may not this false
   John have cited as well from Polycarp?" It requires a great deal of
   courage to give utterance to such an idle fancy; yet there are men of
   learning who are not lacking in this courage. But the universal and
   radical medicament which must be relied on at the last admits in this
   iIstanc3 of a double application. If the Gospel of John can be thrown
   overboard so easily, the Epistle of Polycarp can not so readily be
   disposed of. Polycarp, then, did not write the epistle. Yet the
   disciple of Polycarp, Irenæus, believed and gave his witness to just
   the contrary. But there are never lacking specious grounds for a false
   position; and the professors of the nineteenth century have the art of
   putting out of sight even an Irenæus and his fellows.

   The attack on the authenticity of Polycarp's epistle is all the more
   worth refuting, because, if successful, it does away no less with the
   genuineness of Ignatius's epistles, all the more troublesome if they
   are to be accepted in the limits which Polycarp and Eusebius assigned
   to them. On this account the latest outbreaks of critical presumption
   and audacity have been directed against the whole Polycarp-Ignatius
   literature. What one of these critical heroes does not venture, another
   does. One goes to work more in '^root and branch" fashion, another more
   artistically. The one contents himself with rejecting on his own
   authority all those passages ill Polycarp's letter which allude to the
   person and epistles of Ignatius, imputing them to a forger known to
   have lived long before Eusebius's time; the other, on the contrary,
   casts away the whole letter. In like manner, the one satisfies himself
   with regarding the three shortest Syrian epistles of Ignatius as
   genuine; the other holds it more advisable to assert that not a single
   one of the collective letters of Ignatius is genuine. Such dealings as
   this would soon convert the temple of God into a common ruin.

   For my own part, I do not hesitate to advance further in the period of
   Polycarp. Justin the Martyr, even before his violent death in Rome in
   166 made his memory dear to the church, had attained to great celebrity
   through his writings. Three of his works are still extant in the
   complete form, and their authenticity is undisputed,--the two apologies
   and the dialogue with the Jew Tryphon. Eusebius displays perfect
   familiarity with the two which were written to defend Christianity
   against the attacks of high pagan authorities, and speaks of them as
   two separate works, one of which was dedicated to the Emperor
   Antoninus, the other to Marcus Aurelius. Jerome repeats the statement
   of Eusebius, and most scholars [39] down to the present day have
   coincided with him. The first work must be assigned to the year 138 or
   139, the other to the year 161, the first year of the reign of Marcus
   Aurelius. Respecting the first, however, it should be said that it was
   in 139 that Marcus Aurelius (Berissimus) was named as Cæsar, yet the
   inscription does not address him with the imperial title. Very recently
   there have been new views taken respecting this matter, and there has
   been unjustified evidence [40] brought forward to support the assigning
   of the year 147 [41] to the production of the first of the two works in
   question: some, moreover, have felt themselves justified in taking a
   position not warranted by Eusebius and Jerome, and in regarding the
   second apology as no independent production, but a mere appendix to the
   first. Neither the one view nor the other appears to me to be
   thoroughly grounded. Still, the value of Justin's testimony is very
   little affected by the question whether he wrote a few years prior or
   subsequently to the year 140. Yet the fact that these two works of
   Justin's were written prior to the middle of the second century makes
   the question one of great interest whether he discussed our Gospels in
   them. It is a topic which has been treated in our time by many persons,
   and with great variance of opinion. What is the essential result gained
   from these investigations? That Justin often quotes from our own
   Matthew, is indisputable. [42] That in various passages he follows Mark
   and Luke, is extremely probable. [43] Yet this fact has been
   invalidated by the efforts of some to show that Justin did not use our
   Gospels as his basis, but writings very like them in character, perhaps
   the Gospel of the Hebrews, or, according to some, the Gospel of Peter,
   which was derived from the latter, but which, with the exception of a
   few passages, [44] has remained entirely unknown to us to the present
   time. One support for this view is found in the fact that some
   quotations of Justin are also found in the pseudo-Clementine homilies,
   having there the same or similar differences from the readings in the
   canonical text. [45] The supposition is, perhaps, an admissible one,
   that Justin, at the very earliest times, drew that Gospel of the
   Hebrews, which contained such repeated references to Matthew, into the
   circle of his evangelical quotations in one of his first works; for we
   have Eusebius's authority, in the first half of the fourth century, for
   the fact that at his time this Gospel was reckoned by several
   authorities as belonging to the canon. On the other hand, it is a
   manifest and groundless exercise of arbitrary authority to hold that
   such of his quotations as harmonize more or less closely with our
   received text are taken from a source respecting which we are left to
   conjecture alone. Such a view is all the more inadmissible from the
   fact that free extracts from our Gospels are fully in accordance with
   the character of the times in which they fall; and this is the same
   epoch, the first half of the second century, to which we trace the main
   origin of the diverse materials which enter into the canon, and more
   especially the Gospels. With equal freedom Justin makes his quotations
   from the Old Testament, even if he may not be proved to take his text
   exclusively from the standard Septuagint. And the fact is not to be
   overlooked, that the passages quoted by Justin from the Gospels can not
   be judged by the documents comprising the New Testament text which has
   come down to us, and which forms the substance of our usual editions;
   it is clear that many of our most widely diffused readings have
   proceeded from earlier or more recent corruptions in the primitive
   text; the Gospels especially were subject to arbitrary changes within
   the very first ten years after they had been committed to writing. [46]

   My discussion thus far of the extracts which Justin makes from the
   Gospels relates solely to those which he draws from the synoptic ones,
   the first three. Despite the prevailing skepticism in this matter, it
   is as good as certain that Justin made use of those three Gospels: but
   all the more obstinate is the assertion that he had no acquaintance
   with John's Gospel. But what in fact is his relation to John? In. my
   opinion there are most cogent reasons for believing that John was read
   and used by Justin. The delineation of the person of Christ,
   characteristic of John, as, for example, in the opening of the Gospel,
   "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word
   was God," and in verse fourteen, "And the Word became flesh," as well
   as the general designation of Jesus as the Logos or Word of God, [47]
   appears unmistakably in not a few passages in Justin, such, for
   instance, as "And Jesus Christ was begotten in a manner wholly peculiar
   to himself as the Son of God, while he is also the Word (Logos) of the
   same." "The primeval force (dunamis) after the Father of All and God
   the Lord, is the Son, the Word (Logos); and I shall show how he through
   the incarnation (sarkopoietheis) became man." "The Word (Logos) of God
   is the Son of the same." "As they have not confessed all that belongs
   to the Logos, which is Christ, they have often uttered what is at
   variance with itself." "Through the Word (Logos) of God, Jesus Christ
   our Saviour became flesh (sarkopoietheis)." To these passages, taken
   from the brief second Apology, I add the following, taken from the
   first (chap. 33): "By the expressions the Holy Ghost and the Power of
   God in Luke i. 35 [the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of
   the Highest shall overshadow thee], we are to understand the Logos,
   which is the' first begotten of God." In the "Dialogue," chap. 105, we
   find that "the same was begotten by the Father of All after a peculiar
   manner as the Word (Logos) and Power (dunamis), becoming flesh through
   the instrumentality of the Virgin Mary, as we learn from the memorials
   which I have already displayed." In order to invalidate the proof found
   here that Justin wrote not independently of John, critics have made an
   effort to point out the differences between the conceptions of Logos
   which they both maintained, and to show that Justin had a superficial
   and merely external view of it. But is it to be supposed that those who
   first accepted the doctrines of John were able to fathom and exhaust
   them all? On the contrary, does not the fact that Justin was not able
   to penetrate to the depths of John's theology show that in his very
   allusions to it, without fully comprehending it, he was not independent
   of it? It seems to me that the internal connection between both meets
   the opponents of the authenticity of John's Gospel in no more
   convincing manner than in showing how the doctrines of John may be
   culled from the words of Justin. [48]

   There are not wanting passages in John's Gospel, moreover, which may be
   found specifically reproduced in Justin. In the "Dialogue," chap. 88,
   he writes of John the Baptist, "The people believed that he was the
   Christ; but he said to them, I am not Christ, but the voice of a
   preacher." This is in direct connection with the words of John i. 20
   and 23; for the first words in the reply of the Baptist have been
   reported by no other evangelist than John.

   Twice can Justin's expressions only be explained by supposing him to
   have been familiar with the account in John ix. of the man who had been
   born blind. He speaks expressly of the miraculous healings effected by
   Jesus, and says in the first Apology (chap. 22) that the Saviour
   restored to health one who was born lame, palsied, and blind. [49] In
   like manner in the "Dialogue" (chap. 69) he declares that Jesus healed
   those who were blind, deaf, and lame from their birth, [50] giving to
   one sound limbs, to another hearing, to a third restored sight. What a
   trick of art is it to take the words "I was born blind," [51] spoken by
   the man who was a defender of Christ, and who corresponds to the blind
   man of Jericho, and to make them refer to an unknown source used by
   Justin, an ostensibly lost authority of the. narrative which he gives
   elsewhere! To what end is this? To no other than to discredit the
   Gospel of John, and to deny that it was before Justin when he wrote.

   The words of Zechariah xii. 10 Justin quotes (first Apology, 52; also
   "Dialogue," 14 and 33) precisely in the language of John xix. 37, "
   they shall look on him whom they pierced." The text of the Seventy,
   which Jerome expressly confirms, has an entirely different translation
   [52] of this passage; yet there is one of the older versions given us
   by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, which coincides with the language
   of John and Justin. There is nothing more improbable than that John and
   Justin were here independent of each other, and followed a translation
   of the Hebrew text which is unknown to us. Is the acceptance of this
   theory, one of the most untenable of positions, taken to avoid the
   manifest connection between the words of Justin and those of John?

   To close this part of our discussion, we find in Justin's first
   Apology, chap. 61, Christ has said, "Unless ye are born again, ye can
   not enter the kingdom of heaven. It is manifest to every one that those
   who have been born once can not enter again into their mother's womb."
   This passage has been the theme of much controversy; but I am fully of
   the opinion that Justin had in view the passage in John iii. 3 to 5,
   "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, [53] he
   can not see the kingdom of God. [54] Nicodemus saith unto him, How can
   a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his
   mother's womb and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto
   thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he can not enter
   into the kingdom of God" [kingdom of heaven according to the Sinaitic
   Codex and other ancient authorities.] Now what means is there of
   escaping the inference which the parallelism in these two passages
   gives rise to? Those who have attempted to do this have quoted Matt.
   xviii. 3, " Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become
   as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven," and
   have given utterance to the suspicion that in some lost Gospel, perhaps
   that of the Hebrews, to which reference has already been made, this
   passage was recorded just as Justin has given it, his authority
   therefor being not John, but some previous writer. [55] In order
   therefore to avoid what lies directly in our path, we are compelled to
   have recourse to, some unknown higher authority. The second part of
   Justin's expression gives all the less reason for appealing from John
   to Matthew, that the fifth verse in the passage in John (standing in
   direct connection with the third), "he can not enter into the kingdom
   of heaven" [Himmelreich], is the apparent basis of Justin's expression,
   "ye can not enter into the kingdom of heaven." The phrase "kingdom of
   God" was completely overshadowed by the more usual one, kingdom of
   heaven. [56] Decisive too of the personal use of John by Justin is that
   expression of the latter relative to the entering again into the
   mother's womb and being born, derived from John iii. 4. To suppose such
   a coincidence of thought and language to have been accidental, is a
   feat of trickery which can deceive no one capable of forming an
   independent judgment.

   To this result, which confirms the authenticity of the first three
   Gospels as much as it does the fourth, I must add two points more,
   which still strengthen my conclusions. One of these is, that Justin is
   in the habit of alluding to the "Memorabilia of the Apostles, known as
   Gospels," without specifically mentioning the names of the authors. Yet
   while doing this he makes particular mention of the fact that the
   writers were apostles [57] and companions of Jesus, and by speaking of
   their combined writings as the "Gospel" he leads us to the undoubting
   conviction that it was invested with full canonical authority: and such
   an investiture naturally allows the names of the writers to fall into
   the background and to be unnoticed, while their writings might have
   general acceptance. In the second place, we have to' notice that
   Justin, even in his first Apology (chap. 67), asserts that in the
   Christian congregations the "Memorabilia of the Apostles or the
   writings of the Prophets" were read every Sunday. Here then is an
   instance of the Gospels and the prophetical books being placed on the
   same plane, the first being exalted to the same canonicity which the
   latter had enjoyed from the first. It is an error or a self-deception
   to deny that Justin's words do not warrant the acceptance of those
   books as canonical, on the ground that there were writings read in the
   church which were not accepted as a part of the canon. There were such
   books indeed, but they formed a class subordinate to the canon, and
   pre-supposing the formation of it. Of course there was not at the
   outset an immediate recognition of the equality of the Christian
   records with the hallowed books of the Old Testament; but after the
   church had enlarged the canon by admitting those sacred writings which
   had sprung from a common source, and had given them equal honor with
   those previously accepted, there came into view certain books which had
   more or less claim to recognition as canonical: and thus it came about
   that some were admitted to the prerogative of being read in the
   churches, without sharing the same honor which was given to those
   accepted as fully canonical. At a later period the church found it to
   be for its interest to assign to these books, to which usage gave a
   kind of half-canonical character, a rank equal to the highest. That
   this does not apply in the least to the earliest formation of the
   Christian canon is shown by the Muratori Fragment which speaks of the
   Apocalypse of John and of Peter. We accept these, but the last named is
   not admitted by some of our scholars to the honor of being publicly
   read in church. This doubt expresses distinctly the want of full
   canonical authority which led to the rejection of the writing in
   question. Later usage can not do away with this; and just as little can
   the fact that in some instances the direct relation of a paper to a
   single congregation became a source of advantage to the common church,
   as is testified by Dionysius of Corinth (Euseb., Hist. Eccl. iv. 23) in
   the case of the letters of Clemens and Soter to the Corinthians. In the
   Muratori Fragment already referred to, it is stated, toward the end of
   the Shepherd of Hermas, that he was to be recommended for private use,
   but not for public worship, and that he was to be included neither in
   the number of prophets nor apostles.

   The manner in which Justin expresses himself in the passage quoted
   above (first Apology, chap. 67) makes it impossible, in my opinion, to
   doubt that in his time the Gospels were accepted as of canonical
   authority. We possess in fact a much earlier testimony of this equality
   in one of the generally accepted seven short letters, in that to
   Smyrna, the seventh chapter, where are the words, "It behooves us to
   give heed to the prophets, and especially to the Gospel, in which the
   passion and the resurrection are fully portrayed." Here too, as the
   reader observes, there is a manifest coupling of the prophets and the
   authors of the Gospels, i. e. the books which in their full extent and
   defined limits form the Gospel, and a proof that both were in common
   use in the church. [58]

   These are proofs from the first quarter (whether the year be taken as
   107 or 115) and from the second quarter (139, or, as some suppose, ten
   years earlier) of the second century, that at that time the Gospels
   were held as of equal validity with the prophets, and were admitted to
   canonical authority, a place being assigned them directly after the
   prophetical books. What is not told us in detail respecting the various
   Gospels may be inferred from many other testimonies. I have already
   shown, from various passages of Justin Martyr's undisputed writings,
   that our Gospels, without the exception of the fourth, that of John,
   were admitted to form one Gospel, and to be invested with canonical
   authority. Is it possible, therefore, for the opinion to be justified
   that at Justin's time other Gospels than ours were in use as having had
   a sacred origin, in spite of the fact that, decades after Justin,
   these, and no others, were in repute through the whole Christian
   church? Does it not contravene all that we know of the origin of the
   canon, that at the outset, and even in the age of Justin, only Matthew,
   Mark, and Luke were regarded as canonical, and that John was
   subsequently smuggled in?

   According to the views of many, Justin was the author of the Letter to
   Diognetus; but those who assign to this an earlier date, and consider
   it the work of an older cotemporary of Justin's, are more correct.
   Although this short apologetic epistle contains no definite quotation
   from any one of the Gospels, it contains many allusions to evangelical
   passages, and especially to John. The words of the sixth chapter,
   "Christians live in the world, but are not of the world;" those of the
   tenth, "for God has loved men, for whom he created the world; . . . .
   to whom he has sent his only-begotten Son," contain almost unmistakable
   references to John xvii. 11, "these are in the world;" 14, "the world
   hateth them, for they are not of the world; " 16, "they are not of the
   world, even as I am not of the world;" and to John iii. 16, "for God so
   loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son."

   But before advancing further we must come back to the Gospel of the
   Hebrews, whose use in connection with our synoptic Gospels is rendered
   probable by the language of Justin, by the pseudo-Clementine, and even
   by Tatian's Diatessaron, or Harmony of the Gospels, and testified by
   Eusebius (iv. 22: 3) of Hegesippus. Does not this bring into great
   uncertainty the character of the earlier Gospel canon? It certainly
   appears to do so if the Gospel of the Hebrews is admitted to a place
   side by side with the synoptic Gospels, and be regarded as an
   independent production. Against such a view there are a variety of
   considerations to be urged. I have already mentioned that the
   authorship of this Gospel was ascribed to Matthew. We shall see,
   further on, that at a very early period, in its original Hebrew form,
   it was held to be the work of Matthew, and that Greek editions, with
   many changes in the text, were in use among the judaizing Christians.
   This has led to the result that the passages of the Gospel of the
   Hebrews which have been transmitted to us from antiquity, and more
   especially those which have recently been brought to light [59] by the
   writer of these pages, manifest a striking parallelism with our Gospel
   of Matthew. All these circumstances lead to the conviction that at the
   beginning, and probably during the first half of. the second century,
   the Gospel of Matthew and that of the Hebrews were regarded not as
   essentially different productions, but as different editions of the
   same document, and that by degrees greater light was diffused regarding
   the variations in them. Thus Irenæus states of the Ebionites, in two
   passages (i. 26: 2; iii. 11: 7), that they made use of the Gospel of
   Matthew; while Eusebius (iii. 27), probably referring to the first of
   these passages, corrects Irenæus's statement, and puts the Gospel of
   the Hebrews in the place of that of Matthew. Yet it happened, near the
   end of the fourth century, that the most learned theologian and most
   experienced critic of his age, Jerome, while in possession of the
   Gospel of the Hebrews in the Syro-Chaldaic dialect of the country, and
   full of the recollections of an older tradition, believed that it was
   the original text of Matthew fallen into his hands. After becoming more
   fully acquainted with it, and after translating it into Latin and
   Greek, he acknowledged that many believed that it was the work of
   Matthew himself.

   Thus far we have been concerned almost exclusively with the writings of
   men in whom the church, from the second century, in which they lived,
   onward, recognized venerated pillars of the faith. Yet at the same
   epoch there was a rich literature, which, in conjunction with what was
   ecclesiastical, put forth a rank growth, which elevated far above the
   simple Christian doctrine a system of speculations evolved from the
   schools of heathen and Jewish philosophy: I refer to the heretical
   views which became current, and which may be also known as the
   doctrines of the Errorists. Even from this literature we derive
   convincing proofs that by the middle, or even before the middle of the
   second century, our Gospels had attained the highest degree of
   consideration. This is interesting not more for the light which it
   throws upon the earlier history of heresy than for that which it sheds
   upon the age and the origin of our Gospels. In calling upon these
   errorists to give evidence respecting the Gospels, we have no less an
   authority than Irenæus, that Bishop of Lyons of whom I have elsewhere
   spoken in detail. Irenæus himself utters the expression, "So firmly are
   our Gospels grounded, that even the errorists are compelled to
   acknowledge their credibility, and each one of them must begin with
   them in order to lay the foundations of his own system." [60] This is a
   judgment passed by the second half of the second century on the
   character of the first half. And this first half of the second century
   is just the period to which the opponents of the genuineness of our
   Gospels are accustomed to appeal. Now, are we to suppose that a man
   like Irenæus, who lived only a few decades after the period to which I
   am referring, was not better acquainted with the facts than the
   scholars and professors of the nineteenth century? The more the respect
   due to the true progress of science in our age, the less is owed to
   those scholars who employ their knowledge and acumen for the purpose of
   thrusting at truth. The accuracy of what Irenæus testified to can be
   substantiated even today with facts; and our tread is all the more
   secure if we do not withhold our belief. What the earliest Fathers have
   testified respecting the primitive errorists (and to the hints of the
   former we owe the larger share of our knowledge about the latter),
   shows us, in the most convincing manner, how radically separate they
   were from the Gospels, and from the books which were considered holy by
   the church. Irenæus himself is one of the chief preservers of these
   indications; after him comes a work (discovered only twenty years ago)
   of a disciple of Irenæus, Hippolytus by name, a man who lived so nearly
   contemporaneously with those errorists as to warrant being received as
   equally good authority as Irenæus regarding them.

   One of the boldest and most gifted thinkers among those errorists was
   Valentinus, [61] who came from Egypt to Rome about the year 140, and
   resided there for the twenty years succeeding. He undertook the task of
   writing a complete history of those "supernal transactions which took
   place in the realm of the divine primeval Powers and supernatural Being
   before the sending of the only-begotten of the Father," hoping to be
   able to determine the better from the character of these events the
   nature and mission of the Son of God. In carrying out this stupendous
   design, he did not overlook the bumble task of culling from John's
   Gospel a great number of conceptions and expressions, such as the
   Only-Begotten, the Word, Light, Life, Fullness, Truth, Grace, Saviour,
   Comforter, and of using them for his purpose. There is in this such an
   undeniable connection between the Gospel of John and the edifice of
   Valentine's construction that only two explanations of it are possible.
   Either Valentine made use of John or John of Valentine. The latter
   alternative, according to my previously stated views of the second
   century, must be regarded as pure nonsense, and closer investigation
   into the matter confirms this. If science, hostile to the church, is
   able to reconcile itself to this fact, it passes judgment on itself.
   Irenæus states explicitly that the sect of Valentine made the fullest
   use of the Gospel of John; [62] and he gives the most explicit
   demonstration that the first chapter of John was drawn upon for one of
   the main features of the Valentinian system, the doctrine of the first
   Ogdoade. [63] The statement of Irenæus confirms that of Hippolytus, for
   he cites expressions of John which Valentine had quoted. This is the
   most clearly the case with John x. 8; for Hippolytus writes, "Whereas
   the prophets and the law, according to Valentine's belief, were filled
   with a subordinate and foolish Spirit, Valentine says, 'The words of
   the Saviour are, "All who came before me are thieves and murderers."'"
   [64] And as the Johannean, so were the other Gospels used by Valentine.
   According to the statement of Irenæus, he considered (i. 7: 4) the
   subordinate Spirit already mentioned, which he termed Demiurgos and
   Taskmaster, to be represented by the centurion of Capernaum (Matt.
   viii. 9; Luke vii. 8); in the dead and resuscitated twelve-year-old
   daughter of Jairus he recognized an image of his "sub-wisdom"
   (Achamoth), the mother of the Taskmaster (i. 8: 2); in like manner in
   the history of the woman who had suffered for twelve years from an
   issue of blood, and was healed by the Lord (Matt. ix. 20), he
   recognized the pains and restoration of his twelfth primeval spirit
   (Æon) i. 3: 3; and the expression of Jesus recorded in Matt. v. 18 he
   applied to the ten æons hinted at in the numerical value of the Iota,
   the smallest letter.

   What do they who deny the high antiquity of John's Gospel say to this?
   They assert that all that pertains to John was not brought out by
   Valentine himself, but by his disciples. In fact, the expression is
   much more frequent in Irenæus "they say"--the followers of
   Valentine--than "he says," meaning Valentine himself. But who is wise
   enough to discriminate between what the master said and what the
   disciples added, without echoing their master in the least? [65] We
   must here touch once more upon the passage of Irenæus (iii. 11: 7)
   where he expresses himself respecting the relation of the heretics to
   the Gospels. After the sentence, "So securely are our Gospels founded,
   that even the errorists give testimony for them, and every one of these
   begins at the Gospels when he wants to try the foundations of his own
   system," he goes on to say, "For the errorists make exclusive use of
   the Gospel of Matthew, and are convinced from his pages alone of their
   error respecting the Lord. Marcion, however, avails himself of the
   mutilated Gospel according to Luke, and the very part which he retains
   makes his blasphemy against the only God apparent. Those who separate
   Jesus from Christ, and insist that it was Christ alone, and not Jesus,
   who suffered, assign a preference to the Gospel according to Mark. If
   they read it with real love of truth, they can be cured of their error;
   but they who cleave to Valentine make the fullest use of John's Gospel
   for the confirmation of their doctrine of Æons; and from this it can be
   seen that they teach nothing correctly, as we have shown in our first
   book." Does this representation of Irenæus accord with the view that
   the use of the Gospel according to John began with the disciples of
   Valentine, and not with Valentine himself? Irenæus declares the use of
   the Johannean Gospel to have been a characteristic feature of
   Valentine's school; and those names and conceptions already alluded to,
   which pervaded the whole system, testify convincingly to this: yet was
   all this a mere affix to the system? So much respecting Irenæus. In
   Hippolytus the expression is even more definite regarding Valentine. If
   now it is indisputable that the author does not always discriminate
   closely between the sect and the founder of the sect, have we an
   example of this in the case now under consideration? In those
   instances. where, in the course of a consecutive delineation, we are
   called upon to consider now the founder and then the sect, is it not
   more logical to conclude that the founder and the sect are to be taken
   as inseparably connected?

   From one disciple of Valentine's, Ptolemaus by name, we receive a
   learned epistle, directed to "Flora." In it, in conjunction with
   several quotations from Matthew, is one from the first chapter of John:
   "All things were made by him (the Word), and without him was not
   anything made that was made, says the apostle." The method employed to
   rob such quotations of their force is to make the errorists who use
   these words as modern as possible; if it be possible to trace them back
   only to the close of the second century, the proofs drawn from them do
   not accomplish anything more than to substantiate what is already
   known, that at that time, as the opponents of the church gladly
   concede, the church in its ignorance had fallen into the use of the
   canon of four Gospels. But how recent was Ptolemaus's time? In all the
   most ancient sources he appears as one of the most distinguished and
   most influential disciples of Valentine's. As the epoch of the latter
   was about the year 140, do we go too far in setting the time of
   Ptolemaus at about 160 at the latest? Irenæus (in the second book) and
   Hippolytus name him in connection with Herakleon; and, in like manner,
   Pseudo-Tertullian (in the affix to De prescripitionibus hærticorum) and
   Philastrius place him directly after Valentine. Irenæus in all
   probability wrote the first and second books of his great work before
   the year 180, and in both he concerns himself very much with Ptolemaus.

   Here, however, we must bring in the testimony of Herakleon, the other
   very eminent disciple of Valentine. Herakleon wrote all entire
   commentary on the Gospel of John; his work is known to us through the
   many fragments which Origen has woven into his own commentary on the
   same Gospel. From these fragments it is plain that Herakleon's object
   was carried out with consummate skill, to base the assertions of his
   school on John: in this he took the course which we have already
   remarked in Valentine. Wholly absorbed in his own ideas, he found them
   reflected in a certain double sense of Scripture which he traced
   particularly in John. In the passage, for example, iii. 12, "after
   that, he withdrew to Capernaum," he held that there is an allusion to
   the domain of material and worldly things to which the Saviour
   condescended. The want of susceptibility in this domain of sense he
   thought to be indicated by the fact that John has given us no account
   of what Jesus said or did while in Capernaum. The Samaritan woman at
   the well of Jacob was to him the representative of all souls which feel
   themselves drawn to what is divine; the water of Jacob's well, which
   could not satisfy all spiritual necessities, was the transitory Judaic
   economy. The man whom the woman is required to summon is her spiritual
   complement, her pleroma, her angel tarrying in the higher world of
   spirits. The water which was offered to her indicates the divine life
   which was poured forth by the Saviour; the jar of the woman portrays
   her susceptibility for this divine life. Is not this commentary the
   most striking proof of the high authority which the Gospel of John must
   have had even then in the church, when the very errorists who had
   turned away from the church so willingly sought the confirmation of
   their own ideas in it? And does not this show at a glance the absurdity
   of the theory which derives John's Gospel from the school of Valentine?
   But the question recurs, How old is Herakleon? It is one which has been
   urged with consummate skill against our ancient sacred literature; and
   the answer has been given with incredible thoughtlessness, that he was
   the cotemporary of Origen and of Hippolytus. Unquestionably the
   oppressive weight of the matter under discussion has been experienced,
   and hence has arisen the blindness to the evidences of antiquity which
   are still in existence. [66]

   Irenæus mentions Herakleon in connection with Ptolemaus [67] in a way
   which shows him to have been a well-known representative of the school
   of Valentine. This acceptation of his words is all the more fully
   justified by the fact that he makes no further allusion to Herakleon.
   Clemens reminds us in the fourth book of his Stromata, written soon
   after the death of Commodus (193), of an interpretation given by
   Herakleon to Luke xii. 8, and terms him at the same time the most
   distinguished member [68] of Valentine's school. Origen states, at the
   commencement of his citations from Herakleon, that he was held to be a
   friend of Valentine's. [69] Hippolytus alludes to him in vi. 29 in the
   following words: "Valentinus and Herakleon and Ptolemaus and the whole
   school of these disciples of Pythagoras and Plato." Epiphanius says
   (Hær. 41), "Cerdo (the same who, according to Irenæus, iii. 4: 3, was
   with Valentine in Rome) follows these (the Ophites, Kainites, Sethians)
   and Herakleon." According to this evidence, Herakleon can not be
   assigned to a date more modern than 150 or 160. The expression which
   Origen has used of his relations to Valentine must, according to the
   usages of speech, be understood as applicable to a personal relation.
   [70] Epiphanius has certainly erred (an occurrence not often met in
   him) in letting Cerdo, whose epoch must be set at about 140, follow
   Herakleon; but we have not the slightest right to suppose that he has
   made a mistake equal to the entire length of a man's life, and even
   more. [71] And on this account we may rejoice in the fact that a
   Gnostic partisan write a complete commentary on the Gospel of. John
   soon after the middle of the second century.

   Had this Gospel then freshly appeared, and was it so flattering to the
   representatives of the Valentinian Gnosis that these gave it a cordial
   welcome? Assuredly it was no light task for them to draw out of the
   simple words of John their own profound system. And it is not a little
   remarkable that the church thoroughly shared in the fancies of the
   errorists who had wandered so far out of the way. In addition to this,
   there were those who knew that John had duly died at Ephesus without
   leaving behind any such legacy as a Gospel, and that such a work as it
   was could not have lain hid till that late day in a corner. If the
   reader was not able to come to an understanding with himself in this
   wondrous thought-structure, he only confirmed this fact, that the
   commentary of Herakleon is one of the strongest proofs that then, when.
   it was written, the Gospel of John had long been revered as one of the
   hallowed writings of the church, so that it seemed to Herakleon a thing
   of special importance to show that this apostolic document, if it
   should be rightly interpreted, must be used to confirm the system of
   Valentine.

   While dealing with Valentine, or, according to the order of time,
   before reaching Valentine, we encounter Basilides, the period of whose
   activity occurs, according to Eusebius, at the epoch of Hadrian. With
   all his exhaustive speculations on the Primeval, and the secret,
   incomprehensible and lofty forces which spring from it with living
   impulse, with all his meditations on the principles of light and
   darkness, life and death, his method of grasping the subject of faith
   allied him by a close bond with the adherents of time church, who stood
   on a lower platform, so far as profession is concerned, than was the
   case with Valentine. One of his chief productions appears to be a
   commentary in twenty-four books on the Gospel. Eusebius (iv. 7) infers
   the existence of this work from the statements of a cotemporaneous
   opponent of Basilides, Agrippa Castor by name. Fragments from his book
   appear to have been preserved by Clemens, Origen, Epiphanius, and the
   so-called Archelaus Disputation. Has this work any relation to the
   subject now under review? It certainly appears to have. For the
   expression quoted by Eusebius from Agrippa Castor, that Basilides wrote
   twenty-four books [72] "on the Gospel," almost compels us to turn our
   thoughts to those Gospels which, according to that earliest form of
   speech which comes to light even in Justin and Irenæus, were designated
   as "the Gospel," even although the Gospel of the Hebrews, passing under
   the name of Matthew, was the substitute for our Matthew. That this view
   of the work of Basilides, on the skeptical side, is simply ludicrous,
   may be seen at a glance. Still it is in harmony with what we gather
   from the letters of Ignatius, from Polycarp, and from Justin,
   respecting the place which the Gospels held in the first half of the
   second century. The fragments which have been alluded to do not
   invalidate this view, but rather confirm it. So, too, what Clemens
   cites (Strom. 3: 1) as from Basilides is closely connected with Matt.
   xix. 11, 12; [73] the quotation from Basilides, found in Epiphanius
   (Hær. 24: 5), is in direct alliance with Matt. vii. 6; [74] that found
   in Origen in the commentary (lib. v. cap. 5) to the Epistle to the
   Romans begins with the words from Romans vii. 9; his words are, "For
   the apostle has said, 'Once I lived without the law.'" From this we
   infer the general connection of Basilides with our New Testament. [75]

   To this must be added what we learn through the Philosophumena of
   Hippolytus concerning Basilides. This work contains a detailed account
   of him, having direct quotations from Paul [76] and Luke, [77] an
   allusion to Matthew, and two passages from John. In vii. 22, we read,
   "And that is what is said in the Gospels, 'he was the true Light, which
   lighteth every man that cometh into the world."' John i. 9. In this
   passage the expression "in the Gospels" is entitled to its due weight:
   it presupposes the existence of the evangelical canon hinted at in the
   other forms of quotation, such as "the Scripture says," and "it is
   written." Furthermore, in vii. 27, we find the expression "That
   everything has its time" is amply confirmed by the words of the
   Saviour, when he says, "My hour is not yet come." John ii. 4. Does not
   this bring into perplexity those who are so certain that at the time of
   Basilides not a word of John's Gospel was written? But no; there is a
   ready way out of this difficulty. That to which the words, "in the
   Gospel it is said," give a happy indication, is made to mean, (because,
   forsooth, no trace of a collection of Gospels can be traced back to
   that epoch,) that Hippolytus is not dealing with the genuine Basilides,
   but with a Basilidian document which was the product of his own time.
   Without entering upon an investigation of that discrimination which
   Hippolytus, who is so familiar with all that pertains to the ancient
   heretics, has made between his Basilides and the one yet more ancient,
   we must at least grant that he has made distinct and explicit [78]
   reference to the older Basilides, and that he is not satisfied with his
   reader's accepting any other. Are we to suppose that it was a simple
   matter for the man who had been the disciple of Irenæus, and had died
   in the year 235, to err so singularly, while in the latest years of his
   life he was preparing a work drawn from first sources, as to ascribe to
   Basilides at the time of Hadrian what had been added during his own
   time by the followers of Basilides? Are we able to determine with
   certainty when the old system left off and the new began? And if we
   deny them both, and dare give credence to Hippolytus, we must admit
   that he has done us a great service in showing conclusively that
   Basilides and his school recognized the Gospels as books of
   ecclesiastical authority long before the middle of the second century,
   and expressly made use of the Gospel of John for his ends.

   We come to the same result if we trace the relations of other Gnostic
   sects, the Naasenians and the Perates for example. The first derive
   their name from the Hebrew word naas, a snake, corresponding to the
   Greek Ophites. While the last name was long used by Irenæus and others,
   that of Naasenians began to be made current (aside from reference of
   Theodoret) [79] through the Philosophumena of Hippolytus. That the
   Naasenians were nothing but a fraction of the Ophites is not at all
   substantiated by the efforts made to support this hypothesis, and is
   wholly disproved by the statement of Hippolytus, who put the Naasenians
   and the Perates at the head of the Gnostics, giving them precedence
   before Simon Magus, the Valentinians, and Basilides, but, as he states
   expressly (v. 6), assigning them priority over all the other Gnostics.
   But while we place the opinion of Hippolytus above the doubts which
   negative criticism has raised, we yet reckon among the most valuable
   comments on the Gospels the following excerpts made by Hippolytus from
   the writings of the Naasenians living in the first half of the second
   century. In v. 8 he has this: "For all things, he asserts, (the writer
   of the Naasenian document) have been made by the same hand, and without
   that hand is nothing made. And what is made in him [80] is Life." [81]
   In another passage: "That it is which we have learned of the Saviour,
   'Except ye drink my blood and eat my flesh, ye shall not enter the
   kingdom of heaven (John vi. 53); Except ye drink the cup which I drink
   (Mark x. 38; Matt. xx. 22); Whither I go ye can not come.'" John viii.
   21. Soon after he says, "His voice we have heard indeed, but his form
   have we not seen." John iii. 8; v. 37. In the same connection we find,
   "Touching this our Saviour says, 'No man can come to me except my
   heavenly Father draw him.'" John vi. 44. Again, v. 9, "For, says he,
   God is a Spirit, and those who worship him must worship him neither on
   this mountain nor in Jerusalem, but in spirit." Cf. John iv. 21, 24.
   Soon after we meet the words, "But if thou knewest who it is that asks
   thee, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
   living water." Connected with these passages, so evidently from John,
   there are others from Matthew (vii. 6, 13,14; iii. 10; xiii. 3, et
   sq.), and from Paul's Epistles (1 Cor. ii. 13, 14; 2 Cor. xii. 2, et
   sq.)

   We ought not to refrain from adding to these Naasenian citations from
   John and found in Hippolytus, what is given to us in the writings of
   the Ophites, in that pseudo-Tertullianic document (Append. to Text de
   præscr. hæret.) which those who lean to the Philosophumena believe to
   be drawn from a writing still more ancient. The quotation from John
   stands in the closest relation to that glorification of the serpent
   from which the sect of Naasenians derives its name; and all the more
   forcibly are we compelled to assign to the founder of the sect, and not
   to some later effort from it, the application of the passage from John.
   In the pseudo-Tertullian (chap. 47 of the document de præscr. hær.) it
   is expressly stated, "To these must be added those heresiarchs who are
   called Ophites, i. e., Serpent-men. These pay such honors to the
   serpent that they place it even before Christ. For to the serpent, they
   say, we owe the beginning of our knowledge of good and evil. When Moses
   comprehended the greatness and power of the serpent, he elevated one of
   brass, and all who looked upon it were made whole. Besides this, they
   assert that even Christ hints at the sacredness of the serpent, when he
   says, 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
   must the Son of man be lifted up.'" John iii. 14. We meet the same
   passage, as I shall presently show, in the literature of the Perates.
   For just as from the writings of the Naasenians many passages were
   selected by Hippolytus, so were many also taken from those of the
   Perates, especially such as were originally derived from the Gospel of
   John. I need cite but two of these, Art. v. 12. "For the Son of man is
   not come into the world to condemn the world, but that through him the
   world might be saved." John iii. 17; v. 16. "And as Moses lifted up the
   serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man also be lifted
   up." John iii. 14. [82]

   I have as yet made no mention of Marcion, a man whose nature and
   activities were strangely divided between the faith of the church and
   the Gnostic heresy. It is the more necessary for me to allude to him
   because use has been made of his writings in a way entirely at variance
   with my own convictions. He was born at Sinope, on the Black Sea, the
   celebrated Pontine capital of that time, in the early part of the
   second century. Subsequently to the year 128 he appears to have
   inculcated his peculiar doctrines at Rome; and, making it his special
   purpose to sever Judaism from Christianity, he undertook to eliminate
   from the apostolic writings everything which favored the former. In
   consequence of a statement which has come down to us from antiquity,
   that this writer made a collection of sacred writings (which may have
   taken place before the middle of the second century, between 130 and
   140), [83] and that he admitted into this collection only the Gospel of
   Luke and ten of Paul's Epistles, making such changes, moreover, in the
   text of them all as compelled them to suit his ideas, many scholars
   have supposed that this was the very first collection of sacred
   writings made by the church, and that the Gospel which he admitted into
   his collection was not Luke's, but was the as model which was followed
   when the one which we possess and call Luke's Gospel was written, and
   that he had no acquaintance with our other Gospels, including that
   ascribed to John.

   All three of these positions we hold to be utterly untenable. The first
   of them, which gives to Marcion the priority in making a collection of
   New Testament Scriptures for the use of the church, rests upon a
   complete ignoring of the development of the canon; the elements of this
   development, as my own researches reveal them, I shall take occasion to
   sum up and present on a future page. It also rests upon an ignoring of
   the point of view which Marcion took in relation to the church. Taking
   his stand upon the ground of Paul's expressions in the second chapter
   of the Epistle to the Galatians respecting those departures from the
   purity of the faith which were beginning to be manifested among the
   apostles themselves, he believed himself called, in the Pauline sense
   of the word, to the task of purging the Christian faith of Jewish
   elements. [84] In executing this undertaking nothing was more effective
   than the laying of a correcting hand, upon those writings which even
   then were accepted as the valid standards of belief among the adherents
   of Christianity. The correctness of this mode of procedure, employed
   even by the oldest fathers of the church, was confirmed in a striking
   manner in his dealing with the Pauline Gospels. It is confirmed,
   moreover, by his treatment of Luke's Gospel, of which I shall have
   occasion to speak further on. And does it not harmonize entirely with
   his purpose, that he excluded other New Testament writings from his
   canon? It is possible that in one or another of the excluded documents
   the same anti-judaical spirit would have led to like results; yet it is
   perfectly conceivable, and is not open to our criticism, that in his
   devotion to Paul he contented himself with accepting ten of his
   Epistles and that Gospel, whose author, owing to his being a companion
   and helper of Paul, owed a great deal to the influence exerted upon him
   by Paul, so that his work might almost be called the Gospel according
   to Paul. [85]

   Very recently [86] the statement has been made with consummate naïveté,
   that Marcion, sojourning in a remote province like Pontus, enjoyed a
   limited accessibility to Christian books, and that in making his
   collection he accumulated the greatest amount of materials that his
   scanty advantages allowed. The distance of that province, which at the
   time of Pliny comprised a very large population of Jews as well as of
   Christians, from the two centers of Christian Asia Minor, Ephesus and
   Antioch, is not greater than from Naples to Milan; and who in all the
   world, except a short-sighted professor, would draw the inference that
   a scholar, living in Pontus, during the fourth decade of the second
   century, making a collection of the Christian sacred books, was not
   acquainted with all our Gospels? The Epistles to the Corinthians and to
   the Romans were diffused and accepted; and yet we are to believe that
   the Gospel of John had not found its way from Ephesus to Sinope! [87]
   Finally, the theory which rests on the remoteness of Pontus loses all
   its force in helping us solve the question under discussion, from the
   fact that after Marcion went to Rome, and took a high position there,
   he did not modify at all what he had done in forming his collection of
   sacred writings. At Rome he would assuredly have been able to supply
   the lack of materials from which he is alleged to have suffered at
   Pontus; but we do not learn that he made any addition to his canon
   after coming to Rome.

   The second of the positions mentioned above, that the gospel of Marcion
   served as a model for that which we now accept as Luke's--a position
   which bears the clearest evidence from the outset of being the result
   of reckless ignorance--has been surrendered in our own time by its own
   defenders. Still it is asserted by some scholars that our Gospel
   according to Luke, like that of Marcion, is a modified form of one
   still older but subsequently lost; that that of Marcion consequently
   did not spring from Luke's, but that they both originated in a common
   source, to which Marcion remained true. Going in this direction one
   step further, they succeeded in finding in Marcion the oldest of all
   the Gospel Codices. This view, entirely apart from the last mentioned
   bold act of an intoxicated fancy, is in opposition to what Irenæus,
   Tertullian, and Epiphanius say [88] regarding Marcion's gospel, which
   they possessed; in consequence, however, of the ignorance prevailing
   respecting Marcion's labors, and in consequence also of some
   indemonstrable hypotheses, it has gained a certain appearance of truth
   and consequent acceptance. The efforts to strike out the subsequent
   additions from our Gospel of Luke for the purpose of restoring the
   supposed older original, suffer from that arbitrariness which modern
   hypercriticism has assumed in all discussion of the origin of the
   Gospels. The fact that Marcion gave no name [89] to his Gospel is made
   to give support to the claim that it is the only true Gospel, and is
   entitled to no influence in directing our researches respecting this
   Gospel.

   We come to the third position, a refutation of which will throw light
   upon both of the others. Marcion is asserted to have not possessed the
   other Gospels, including that of John. If Marcion found the other
   Gospels in their main form, just as we possess them now, in the
   possession of the church of his time, the view of the priority of his
   collection over the primitive canon of the church falls to the ground;
   and equally frail is the hypothesis respecting the parallelism between
   the Gospel according to Marcion and our Luke, together with the
   consequences drawn therefrom respecting the authority of our canon in
   its present form; and so there is gained no insignificant proof of the
   high antiquity and the genuineness of the Gospel according to John.

   What grounds have we for believing that Marcion was acquainted with our
   Gospels? All that Irenæus and Tertullian still more explicitly have
   told us in reference to this matter makes it certain. For where Irenæus
   (i. 27, 2) writes concerning Marcion, that in opposition to his pupils
   he held his trustworthiness greater than that of the apostles, who
   transmitted the Gospel (qui evangelium tradiderunt), inasmuch as he did
   not give the (whole) Gospel, but a part of the Gospel (non evangelium,
   sed particulam evangelii), the meaning is, according to Irenæus's use
   of language else. where (i. 27, 2), that Marcion gave his disciples
   only one of the Gospels, namely, that of Luke. That by the expressions
   "evangelium" and "particulam evangelii" we are to understand the
   Gospels, and not the Sermon on the Mount, is shown by another passage
   of his work (iii. 12, 12), where, in reference to Marcion and other
   heresiarchs, we read, "The apostles have spread the Gospel abroad
   filled with Jewish prejudices (adhuc quæ sunt Judæorum sentientes): and
   these are even more fair and wise than the apostles." Irenæus then goes
   on to say, "On this account Marcion and his adherents have made it
   their aim to diminish the extent of the sacred books (ad intercidendas
   scripturas conversi sunt), some of which they lave entirely rejected,
   while they have reduced the size of Luke's Gospel and Paul's Epistles,
   insisting that the scriptures which they have retained and revised are
   the only ones which are to be accepted." These statements of Irenæus
   have no twofold meaning, and are not susceptible of two
   interpretations. He evidently presupposes a familiar knowledge on the
   part of the reader of what he means by the "reducing of the sacred
   books," and by a "non-recognition" of some of them: and in order to
   understand what he means we have only to take his own point of view.

   Tertullian's admissions are much more to the purpose, although in his
   case we have to bear in mind that he is not writing for critical
   scholars, who are accustomed to avail themselves of every lack in a
   complete chain of evidence to help support their own views. After
   citing (adv. Marc. iv. 3) Marcion's misuse of the second chapter of the
   Epistle to the Galatians (see a previous page), he says: "Connititur ad
   destruendum statum eorum evangeliorum quæ propria et sub apostolorum
   nomine eduntur vel etiam apostolicorum, ut scilicet fidem quam illis
   adimit suo conferat." Among the Gospels which he designates as those
   "which bear the name of apostles, or men of apostolic character," are
   to be understood the four which we possess, unless we purposely
   misinterpret Tertullian's words. Shortly before (iv. 2), he had in the
   most definite language [90] designated the Gospels as books which had
   been written by actual apostles, such as Matthew and John, as well as
   by men of apostolic dignity, such as Mark and Luke. In order to escape
   the force of this striking testimony of Tertullian, without accusing
   him of ignorance or falsification, an unfortunate attempt has been made
   to get rid of the difficulty by asserting that apocryphal Gospels are
   here meant, bearing unauthenticated names of apostles. Whoever listens
   for an instant to such a plea--and how one can is hardly to be
   imagined--must hold as not genuine the closing words of Tertullian,
   "and expressly to ascribe to his own testimony the credibility which he
   denies to theirs [the apostolic evangelists]." Tertullian repeats,
   moreover, respecting the passages from Matthew's Gospel, "Marcion has
   stricken this from the Gospel." Comp. adv. Marc. ii. 17; iv. 7. In the
   passage quoted on a previous page, de carne Chr. 2, the words, "tot
   originalia instrumenta Christi, Marcion, delere ausus es," are used in
   direct relation to the first chapters of Matthew and Luke. Adv. Marcion
   iv. 5 he complains of Marcion on the ground that instead of availing
   himself of Luke (a Gospel at second hand), he did not at once take up
   those whose authority (as the work of actual apostles) he knew to be
   higher. [91] De carn. Christ. 3, he says, "If thou hadst not purposely
   rejected or changed the reading of the writings which are opposed to
   thy system, the Gospel of John would surely have convinced thee in this
   matter." We find attention called finally to an epistle of Marcion,
   from the contents of which Tertullian establishes conclusively the fact
   that Marcion once accepted what he subsequently rejected. [92]

   From all this it is established with the utmost certainty that
   Tertullian subjected Marcion to weighty reproaches for rejecting the
   Gospels (including John, once expressly named) which he had once
   accepted, and which Tertullian, in common with the church, continued to
   hold. Au epistle of Marcion which he thought might possibly be
   disavowed by the followers of Marcion [93] served to show him what was
   the character of the man. The question naturally comes up, Is
   Tertullian entitled to credibility in this affair?

   It is now difficult to set aside the claims of those who have enacted
   the history of the primitive Christian church, on a basis of
   anti-ecclesiastical prejudices and fancies. Polemical zeal, united with
   a certain passionate force of conviction, sometimes carried the great
   African polemic too far, and made him unjust to the heretical opponents
   whom he had to confute. But is this general fact enough to warrant us
   in crying out that here he is making false inferences? Men have even
   the hardihood to say--for shamelessness is now an extinct idea--that
   what Tertullian states with all correctness must be set to the account
   of "malicious persecution." [94] That what Tertullian advances finds
   powerful support in Irenæus is plain; but when the clearest and most
   evident matters are made to assume an obscure appearance, how much
   easier to bring under suspicion the passages from Irenæus, which hint
   at more than they openly express. Is anything plainer than that the
   reform [95] which Marcion endeavored to carry into the Gospels aimed
   specifically at correcting the canonical writings of the New Testament?
   Did Tertullian need the help of schoolmasters more than we do, to know
   that "evangelium" has other meanings than a written record? And is the
   accusation brought against Marcion, that he rejected the apostolic
   records, which were well known to him, and which even bore the
   authenticated names of apostles, and that he made arbitrary changes in
   Luke as well as in the Pauline Epistles, anything else than empty
   inference? And why is this attempt made? Is not the object to get rid
   of the truth, to undermine and destroy the force of one of the most
   important means of substantiating the primitive authority of our
   Gospels, more especially that of John? Those readers who are not
   specially engaged in prosecuting learned researches need nothing more
   than what has already been given to qualify them for passing judgment
   on this matter. Such readers ought to use every occasion to ascertain
   what the character of the learning is, which those professors sustain
   who make it their task to decry the authenticity of the Gospels.

   One of the most interesting phenomena in the church, and one of lasting
   influence, was Montanism. Its aim was to stem the violent tide of
   Gnosticism, which was swamping the simple older faith with philosophic
   speculation, and sought to benefit men by giving them a deep inward and
   direct apprehension of divine truth. Taking a stand not only against
   foreign speculations but equally against the traditional deadness of an
   external ecclesiasticism, it, like Gnosticism, at length shot above the
   church through its exaltation of a fanatical spirit of prophecy, above
   the tranquil and orderly development of Christianity through doctrines
   of the new birth and spiritual illumination.

   If, following the object which I have in view, we ask what place
   Montanism took in relation to the writings of the New Testament, the
   greatest difficulty in the way of finding an answer lies in the fact
   that we are scarcely in a position to make a general discrimination
   between the form which had been given at the end of the second century
   by means of Tertullian's reformatory character, to the theological
   system then existing, and that which it had assumed at the outset ill
   Syria. The account given by Eusebius, although drawn from fragments
   dating from the comparatively recent time of Marcus Aurelius (161 to
   180), and that of Epiphanius, which aimed more distinctively at a
   confutation of opponents, are of a very incomplete character. The
   little which Irenæus has respecting this matter is hinted at in such
   various fashion that one hint only darkens the meaning of another. The
   scanty allusions in the Philosophumena of Hippolytus give rise to the
   suspicion that they relate rather to Tertullian's epoch than to the
   beginning of Montanism in the year 150.

   The distinctive question which meets us here is this: Has Montanism
   from the very first appropriated to itself, independently of John's
   Gospel, that prophetic spirit which was poured out, as is averred, on
   Montanus, his female companions, and his followers, and which stood in
   intimate connection with the Paraclete which was promised by the
   Saviour to his disciples (John xiv. 16, 26)? The wanton character of
   Phrygian fanaticism leads us to suspect that the letter of Scripture
   was held in no regard; and the extracts quoted in Eusebius (v. 16 to
   19), as well as the document of Epiphanius, contain nothing which can
   give us any light in this matter. It is quite otherwise with what
   Eusebius, and, long before him, Irenæus and Hippolytus record. [96] In
   Irenæus (iii. 11, 9) we read: "But others, in order to do away with the
   gift of the Spirit, which, according to the counsel of the Father, is
   poured out on all flesh, do not accept that promise made in the Gospel
   of John, that the Lord will send down the Paraclete, casting away not
   only this prophetic gift, but the Gospel as well which records its
   sending. It is truly their misfortune that, while granting that there
   are false prophets, they yet deny to the church the true and real gift
   of prophecy; it is with them as with those who, because there are
   hypocrites in the church, withhold themselves from all fraternal
   converse with the brethren." [97] The reference of this passage to the
   Montanists we hold in common with Lucke and others as not at all made
   out; [98] but we regard the argument as conclusive, that the opponents
   of the Montanists, wittily called by Epiphanius, in a double use of
   language, Alogians, are meant. Epiphanius also bears evidence that the
   Alogians rejected the Gospel and the Apocalypse of John. But if it is a
   real characteristic of the opponents of Montanism, that they rejected
   John's Gospel, it is entirely probable that this was the result of the
   connection between the prophetic Spirit of the Montanists and the
   Paraclete of that Gospel It is not credible that the Alogians first
   brought this connection into view; according to the words of Irenæus,
   previously cited, it is certain that he was already of the opinion that
   the Alogians had rejected this Gospel simply because of this
   connection, and because it seemed to be drawn from John. Irenæus may be
   incorrect in his supposition that this was the only or the main ground
   for the Alogians' rejection [99] of this Gospel; but Epiphanius bears
   witness that they could not account for the want of accordance between
   John's and the synoptic Gospels. To me, however, it seems to be
   necessarily inferred from the statements of Irenæus that he presupposes
   that the Montanists themselves brought their prophetical Spirit into
   harmony with the Paraclete of John's Gospel, and therefore made use of
   the latter document. Lastly, we have a statement of Hippolytus hinted
   at; it is found in the Philosoph. viii. 19, and runs as follows: "The
   Phrygian heresiarchs have been infatuated by Priscilla and Maximilla,
   whom they hold to be prophetesses because they aver that the Paraclete
   has entered into them."

   How then lies the matter? The short extracts given by Eusebius from the
   writings of early opponents contain nothing in reference to the
   connection between the Montanists' prophetical Spirit and the Paraclete
   of John; no more do the refutations of Epiphanius; but Irenæus,
   Hippolytus, Tertullian, [100] and Eusebius are united in averring that
   this connection did exist; and the fact that the Alogians rejected the
   Gospel of John, according to the statement of Irenæus, assuredly
   harmonizes with the honor which was paid by the Montanists to this
   Gospel.

   Yet there has been the same effort to pervert the relation of Montanism
   to John's Gospel as in the system of Valentine; at least the suspicion
   has been bruited that that Gospel could only have emanated from the
   same circle of theological ideas and be the result of the same movement
   which gave rise to Montanism. What a chaotic confusion of thoughts is
   there in such a charge as this! what a senseless opposition to John's
   credibility is betrayed in the effort to pervert and falsify the
   evidences which go to establish his authenticity! Let us suppose for a
   minute that John's Gospel sprang into existence like Montanism about
   the year 150. De spite the fact that the lateness of its appearance
   must make it seem like the work of a pious fraud, and that in its whole
   structure and in its details it was unlike the earlier Gospels, the
   church, no less than those who opposed the church, and especially the
   Montanists, accepted it with full confidence. To one little sect alone
   did it fall to raise difficulties between the older Gospel and the more
   recent one, and in consequence to reject the latter, and yet without
   gaining either credit or prominence by the act. And is it true that
   there is clear accordance between the Montanist doctrine and that of
   John's Gospel? Not in the least. Aside from the fact that the points
   where they harmonize relate almost exclusively to the idea of the
   Paraclete (an idea which appears in the Gospel without any full
   development, while in Montanism we are directed rather to the
   catholicizing notions entertained by Tertullian than to those held
   earlier), the divergence between Montanism and John's Gospel is as
   great as that between an ecclesiastic prototype and a heretical copy.

   In addition to this, the opponents of Montanism already named give
   noticeable testimony against this and similar depreciations of John's
   Gospel in the middle of the second century, at the time of the
   Montanist movement. They knew nothing about the story of the Gospel of
   John being a new thing first ushered into being in their time; they
   ascribed both the Gospel and the Apocalypse as unworthy of the church
   (Epiph. hær: 51, 3) to Corinth, a cotemporary of John. [101] The very
   opponents of the book, therefore, did not doubt about its age, nor
   bring it under suspicion; they always ascribed it to the epoch in which
   John lived. Does not this show that the church had long used that
   Gospel, and that on that account there was no opening for objections to
   it on the ground of age? It is to be noticed at the same time that the
   same heretics consider the Gospel and the Apocalypse as coherent
   productions, and that they acted as one man in disowning John, and in
   claiming Corinth as the author. The authorship of the Apocalypse,
   expressly stated by Justin to be the production of John, has not been
   doubted even by the Tübingen critics to be the work of John. From the
   acts of the anti-Montanists, however, it is to be inferred that the
   conviction and usage of the church agreed in ascribing both writings,
   the Gospel and the Apocalypse, to John. .

   In this way, as the reader can perceive, even the heretics of the first
   half of the second century and the beginning of the second half do good
   service in helping us ascertain the truth regarding the antiquity of
   our Gospels. We hold it impossible, without resorting to sophistry and
   falsification, to do away with the testimony which these heretics bear
   to the credibility of our Gospels, and especially to that of John.

   We now advance a step beyond the church to the territory where we
   encounter the armed opponents of Christianity, the men to whom the
   whole preaching of the cross was folly and an offense. At that very
   time when the Gnostic errorists were throwing the church into such
   confusion, it happened that one of these opponents, Celsus by name,
   wrote a book full of mockery and scorn at Christianity. This production
   perished long ago; but so far from doing any harm to Christianity, it
   proved to be a great gain, for it impelled Origen to write his powerful
   and learned defense of Christianity. From Origen's work we draw enough
   to make us certain that in his attacks on the Christian faith Celsus
   made ample use of our Gospels, and that he drew from them the materials
   which he needed in making his attacks. In what he says respecting the
   appearance of angels at the resurrection of Jesus he probably refers to
   all four of the Gospels; for he says that according to some there were
   two angels, according to others, four at the grave (5, 56). Origen
   supposed that the first referred to Luke and John, the last to Matthew
   and Mark. Proceeding in a different and more definite way to work, he
   drew into the circle of his criticism various passages from the
   synoptical Gospels, especially Matthew's, and also some from that of
   John. Among those from the synoptical Gospels may be mentioned the
   account of the wise men from the East (whom he calls Chaldeans), the
   story of the slaughter of the children by Herod (1, 58), the flight
   into Egypt at the bidding of the angel (1, 66), the appearance of the
   dove at the baptism (1, 40), the son of the Virgin (1, 40), the
   direction which Jesus gives to his disciples (Matt. x. 23), "when they
   persecute you in this city, flee ye into another " (1, 65), the grief
   at Gethsemane (2, 24), the thirst on the cross (2, 37), the saying of
   Jesus that it is easier to go through the eye of a needle, etc.--which
   he supposes to be a motto of Plato in a changed form (6, 16),--the
   command of Jesus (Matt. v. 39; Luke vi. 29), "Whosoever shall smite
   thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also," which he also
   supposes to be a modified Platonism. Examples of a reference to John
   are, his statement (1, 67) that the Jews in the temple demanded a sign
   of Jesus (John ii. 18), that he accepts John's expression "Logos" to
   designate Jesus as the Word of God (2, 31), that he ridicules (2, 36)
   the statement that at the crucifixion blood issued from Jesus' side
   (John xix. 34), and that he asserts (2, 59) that after his resurrection
   Jesus displayed his pierced hands as the token of what he had endured
   (John xx. 27). It can not be claimed, in view of this, that Celsus drew
   all these assertions from living Christian tradition; for he himself is
   the very one to lay stress upon the fact that he drew upon the writings
   of the Christians. His words were, as cited literally by Origen (2,
   74), from his own writings: "And this we have drawn from your own
   books; we want no further evidence, and you are impaled on your own
   sword." Origen remarks appositely that Celsus has indeed brought
   forward much that was not in the Gospels, especially some blasphemous
   reports about Mary, and some idle stories about the infancy of Christ;
   these may be found alluded to in the first book which Origen wrote
   contra Celsum [102] (1, 28 and 32). But in the course of his work
   Celsus carried out his idea [103] of adhering closely to the "writings
   of the disciples of Jesus." And plainly this was done out of respect to
   the fact that these writings, and these alone, had authority in the
   church.

   The question here arises, What relation to the witness which Celsus
   bears to the authority of our Gospels is sustained by that criticism
   which does not accept that authority, so far especially as John is
   concerned? As that evidence can not be impugned, unbelieving scholars
   bring into use again here that modernizing system which crops into view
   in Herakleon, to the perfect shame of him who first made it current. As
   in Herakleon, so here, the story runs, Celsus was the cotemporary of
   Origen. But when was that important fact ascertained? Drawing from
   Origen himself, Dr. Volkmar [104] says, "Has not Origen declared at the
   close of his work (8, 76) that the same Celsus announced that he would
   publish a work of more positive character, and that we must wait to see
   whether he would accomplish the undertaking? Origen (254) may have
   written his book against Celsus about the middle of the first half of
   the third century. Nothing is plainer than that Celsus, if he were
   alive at that time and giving men to understand that a new work might
   be expected from his pen, has no importance to us in helping us settle
   this matter. But even here we have to deal with nothing but a piece of
   wretched trickery, with real poverty of resources on the part of the
   critics whom I complain of. For the statement borrowed from the close
   of the work against Celsus rests upon gross ignorance or upon purposed
   deception. The words of Origen to his patron Ambrosius, who had
   stimulated him to write the whole Apology, run after this wise: "Know
   that Celsus promised [unquestionably in his book directed against
   Christianity, and opposed by Origen] to write still another work in
   which" . . . . "If now he has not written this, in spite of his promise
   [105] it is enough for us to answer him with these eight books. But if
   he has done this, and completed [106] his later work, do you hunt it up
   and send it to me, that I may answer it," etc. The difficulty to
   account for is in the words, "we must wait to see whether he would
   accomplish the undertaking." But at the outset, in the very first book,
   Origen says, "I do not know of a single Christian whose faith is in
   peril of being endangered by Celsus, a man no longer among the living,
   but who has been a long time numbered among the dead." They forgot, of
   course, to cut out this passage with the scissors which had been so
   effectually applied to Polycarp. In that same first book Origen says,
   "We have learned that there have been two men bearing the name of
   Celsus, the first under Nero, the second [i. e. ours] under Hadrian and
   later." It is not impossible that Origen erred in identifying his
   Celsus with the Epicurean who lived "under Hadrian and later;" but it
   is impossible to make the Celsus of whom Origen thus speaks, his
   cotemporary. Could Origen have made Celsus in his first book to be
   "under Hadrian and later" (117 to 138), and in the eighth have said of
   the same man, " we must wait to see [about 225] whether he will
   accomplish his undertaking? " So long therefore as we get no more
   reliable information respecting Celsus, we must remain content with
   believing that he wrote his work about the middle of the second
   century, perhaps between 150 and 160; [107] and that his testimony in
   favor of the synoptic and Johannean Gospels dates from that period,--a
   fact of very great weight in enabling us to determine the early
   existence of the evangelical canon.

   With this result, however, we by no means reach the limits of the
   history of Apologies for the Gospels. In order to complete this
   department of our subject, we now enter upon a peculiar branch of the
   literature of the same age with that with which we have been
   dealing,--a branch which, after long neglect, is in our day claiming
   new and respectful attention; viz., the New Testament apocryphal
   literature. This holds a certain position midway between the literature
   of the church and that of the heresiarchs: at any rate. many of its
   features served the ends of the former through the use of the latter.
   It is necessary, however, that I should instruct the reader what the
   theologians understand by the term "apocrypha." The apocryphal writings
   of the New Testament--for it is of these only that I speak--are
   writings which aimed to take their place on the same footing with the
   writings of the New Testament, but which were rejected by the church.
   They bore on the face of them the names of apostles, or of other
   eminent men; but these names have been misappropriated by unknown
   writers for the purpose of recommending what they wrote. The Apocrypha
   were written, partly in order to develop in arbitrary fashion what
   their authors had drawn from Scripture, partly to incorporate
   unauthenticated accounts of the Saviour, Mary, Joseph, and the
   apostles, and partly to give point and efficacy to heretical opinions
   directed against Holy Writ. The church was warranted, therefore, in
   excluding them from her accepted writings. It is true that they have
   been revered as authentic by many from the earliest times; and on this
   account they have a varied interest [108] to readers. I have indicated
   elsewhere in what sense I propose to use them: they only support and
   strengthen our evidence of the very early origin of our Gospels. We
   are, of course, independent of the question how old the apocrypha are;
   and this has left an opening into which opponents have pressed, hoping
   to cut us off on this side. But we have come to the result that the two
   portions of the apocryphal Gospels which are extant now, known as the
   Protevangel of James and the Acts of Pilate, must have been written
   within the three first decades of the second century, and that the main
   substance of those works (though marred by many changes in the text) is
   now in our possession.

   The chief, if not the only, evidence for the age of both of these
   writings is found in Justin. And first with regard to the Protevangel
   of James. In Justin's Dialogue with the Jew Tryphon, and in his first
   Apology, we find in the statements respecting the birth of Jesus and
   the annunciation traces of a knowledge, and of the influence, of the
   book of James. Justin relates in the Dialogue (cap. 78) that the birth
   of Jesus occurred in a cavern near the village, there being no room at
   the inn. This statement, which confirms the account of Luke instead of
   contradicting it, is contained in the book of James, and is woven into
   the substance of the whole history of the event. Still, it is not to be
   overlooked that Justin appropriates only this single fragment
   respecting the birth in the cave, and in the rest follows Luke rather
   than the pseudo-James. The statement respecting the want of room in
   Bethlehem coheres strictly with the narrative of Luke, but is not in
   accord with that of the. pseudo-James. Similarly, the annunciation is
   plainly hinted in the first Apology, although with a free following of
   Luke, with the mere difference that the words, "For he shall save his
   people from their sins," are connected with the words directed to Mary,
   "And thou shalt call his name Jesus." In Luke they are wanting
   altogether, and in Matthew they belong to the message announced to
   Joseph. And have we not a recognition of what is apocryphal in Justin,
   since, at the close of his exposition, he appeals to those who have
   declared everything respecting our Saviour Jesus Christ? But no, that
   can not be said; for the whole account of Justin, as already remarked,
   corresponds strictly to Luke, and not to the Protevangel, only with
   this difference, that the passage indicated varies from the
   Protevangel, Matthew giving the words as announced to Joseph, and
   Justin as addressed to Mary. This feature must, in my opinion, be
   ascribed to the perusal of the Protevangel; and in the recollection of
   Justin it connected itself with Luke's account without his own
   consciousness of the fact. It is unmistakable that the whole quotation
   was made from memory. [109] In the Dialogue (chap. 100), the
   annunciation made to Mary is cited, and the words spring from Luke, and
   not from the Protevangel. [110] At the same time, there is a single
   extract bearing relation to the mental state of Mary, which seems to
   have sprung from a recollection of a passage in the Protevangel; only
   Justin has connected it with the reply of Mary to the address of the
   angel, while the Protevangel joins it to a priestly blessing which she
   received just on the point of setting out to visit Elizabeth. [111]

   But is there no objection urged against our endeavor to substantiate an
   acquaintance of Justin with the Protevangel? Certainly there are lost
   writings which are brought into requisition. Out of one of these it is
   supposed that Justin can just as well have drawn as that the
   Protevangel be derived from it. The Gnostic genna Marias (de
   generatione Mariæ), and still more the Gospel of Peter, [112] have been
   thought to be that ancient work freshly brought to light. And this
   brings us into renewed contact with an old acquaintance, with that same
   faculty of making new discoveries of which I have already had occasion
   to speak. In order to escape the force of a work lying plainly before
   our eyes, the inferences from which are unmistakable, it is held in the
   light of a copy of a perished work, of which we have received from the
   past little but the title and a few meager extracts, which render it
   impossible to set solid facts over against the play of fancy. Yet let
   us look into this matter as closely as we can. Epiphanius [113] has
   given the first impulse toward bringing the Gnostic production already
   mentioned into relation with the Protevangel, in citing something of
   what he calls the "shocking" statements of the work; namely, that there
   appeared to Zacharias in the temple the vision of a man wearing the
   form of an ass. Upon which Zacharias went up to him and tried to say,
   Woe to you! whom are you worshiping? but could not utter the words, the
   man seen in the vision having struck him dumb. But when his mouth was
   opened, and he had communicated to others what he had seen, ho was
   instantly put to death. This fragment from the lost book is enough, I
   should think, to identify its source. And is there that in it which
   enables us to determine that it was the basis of the Protevangel? The
   last has nothing in common with the first, excepting the slaughter of
   Zacharias, but wholly on another ground, and under altogether different
   conditions. But there is help at hand against accumulating difficulties
   respecting the connection of both writings. The way is to conjure up
   and thrust into prominence a work which claims to have given rise to
   that of James. From the Gnostic book relating to Mary sprang this
   Gnostic-tinged--now unfortunately lost--primitive foundation of the
   pseudo-James; and from this again the work of our catholicizing James.
   [114] This ingenious solution may not have quite satisfied even him who
   hit upon it, and hence he thought out and gave preference to another
   combination. In the passage where Origen alludes to the work of James,
   he mentions the Gospel of Peter; for he says the brothers of Jesus were
   regarded by some, who followed the tradition of the Gospel of Peter, or
   that of James's work, as if they had been the sons of Joseph by a
   previous marriage. [115] Now, according to this new combination, the
   question is asked, Can not the Gospel of Peter, or the early history
   given in it, be the basis of the Protevangel? The primitive history in
   the Gospel of Peter rests exclusively upon the passage of Origen
   relating to the brothers of Jesus as the sons of Joseph by an earlier
   marriage. With reference to this, we read without going further. That
   there was such a primitive history, can, according to the statement of
   Origen, be regarded as beyond doubt. From the same passage of Origen,
   the conclusion is drawn that "in the Protevangel of James the primitive
   history of the Gospel of Peter is contained." But do the words of
   Origen, "while they followed the tradition of the Gospel of Peter, or
   that of the work of James," warrant the inference in the least that the
   latter coincides and gives support to the primitive history of the
   Gospel of Peter? But who is able to impose a check upon the unbridled
   fanaticism of theorists? [116] That we are now in possession of nearly
   fifty Greek manuscripts, comprising, among other things, a Syrian copy
   of the work under discussion, dating from the sixth century, and that
   no one of the evidences of its antiquity, from Origen down, is
   contradictory to the text of these manuscripts, gives us assuredly a
   good right to hold fast to the conviction that this was the writing so
   familiar to the ancients, [117] and so much used by them. Is not that
   the most untenable of hypotheses, that our work was derived from one
   which was used by the ancients where it coincides with our own, but of
   which not a trace remains? And what other end does this hypothesis
   subserve than this, to set aside the inferences which are drawn from
   the book of James, and applied not only to the Christian literature of
   the second century, but more especially to the history of the Gospel
   cause? I trust it will not impel those who do riot share these views,
   to regard hypotheses which have such a basis to rest upon as something
   else than they really are. In opposition to them, I am still justified
   in insisting that the undeniable connection between Justin and several
   passages of the so-called Proto-Gospel presupposes his acquaintance
   with this very production. The book of James stands, in its whole
   tendency, in such a relation to our canonical Gospels, that the latter
   must have been diffused a long time, and must have been accepted a long
   time before the former was discovered. The allusions of Matthew and
   Luke to the virgin mother of the Lord were unable to prevent the belief
   in a real son of Joseph and Mary,--an idea consonant with the taste of
   the Judaized Christian heresiarchs: the mention of the brothers of
   Jesus in the synoptic Gospels appeared to bear evidence against Matthew
   and Luke; learned Jews brought against the Christians the charge of
   arbitrarily changing the meaning of Isaiah, and making him support the
   notion of a virgin mother: Jewish hostility even went so far as to
   assert that Jesus was the illegitimate son of one Panthera, and heathen
   skeptics quoted Greek fables about sons being born from virgins, in
   order to discredit the evangelical account. In such a time as was the
   first half of the second century, nothing could promise a better
   support to the Gospel narrative than a production like the one named
   after James, furnished with irrefragable historic testimony as to the
   lofty destiny of Mary from her birth, as to her motherhood while a
   virgin, and as to a relationship of Mary to Joseph exalted far above
   the usual relations of marriage. [118] Now, if this work of James falls
   within the first three decades of the second century, the composition
   of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, to which the reference of James's
   work limits itself, can not be set later than the last decades of the
   previous century.

   It is the same with the second apocryphal work brought under review
   above, the so-called Acts of Pilate, only with the difference that they
   refer as much to John as to the synoptical Gospels. Justin, in like
   manner as before, is the most ancient voucher for this work, which is
   said to have been written under Pilate's jurisdiction, and, by reason
   of its specification of wonderful occurrences before, during, and after
   the crucifixion, to have borne strong evidence to the divinity of
   Christ. Justin saw as little reason as Tertullian and others for
   believing that it was a work of pious deception from a Christian hand.
   On the contrary, Justin appeals twice to it in his first Apology in
   order to confirm the accounts of the occurrences which took place at
   the crucifixion in accordance with prophecy, and of the miraculous
   healings effected by Christ, also the subject of prophetic
   announcement. He cites specifically (chap. 35) from Isaiah lxv. 2, and
   lviii. 2: "I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious
   people, which walketh in a way that was not good." . . . "They ask of
   me the ordinances of justice: they take delight in approaching to God.
   Further, from the twenty-second Psalm: "They pierced my hands and my
   feet. . . . They parted my garments upon them, and cast lots upon my
   vesture." With reference to this, he remarks that Christ fulfilled
   this; that he did stretch forth his hands when the Jews crucified
   him,--the men who contended against him, and denied that he was the
   Christ. "Then," he says further, "as the prophet foretold, they dragged
   him to the judgment-seat, set him upon it, and said, 'Judge us.' The
   expression, however, 'they pierced,' etc., refers to the nails with
   which they fastened his hands and his feet to the cross. And after they
   had crucified him they threw lots for his clothing, and they who had
   taken part in the act of crucifixion divided it among themselves." To
   this he adds: "And you can learn from the Acts, composed [119] during
   the governorship of Pontius Pilate, that these things really happened."
   Still more explicit is the testimony of Tertullian. It may be found in
   the Apologeticus (chap. 2), where he says that out of envy Jesus was
   surrendered to Pilate by the Jewish ceremonial lawyers, and by him,
   after he had yielded to the cries of the people, given over for
   crucifixion; that while hanging on the cross he gave up the ghost with
   a loud cry, and so anticipated the executioner's duty; that at that
   same hour the day was interrupted by a sudden darkness; that a guard of
   soldiers was set at the grave for the purpose of preventing his
   disciples stealing his body, since he ad predicted his resurrection,
   but that on the third day the ground was suddenly shaken, and the stone
   rolled away from before the sepulcher; that in the grave nothing was
   found but the articles used in his burial; that the report was spread
   abroad by those who stood outside, that the disciples had taken the
   body away; that Jesus spent forty days with them in Galilee, teaching
   them what their mission should be, and that, after giving them their
   instructions as to what they should preach, he was raised in a cloud to
   heaven. Tertullian closes this account with the words, All this was
   reported to the emperor at that time, Tiberius, by Pilate, his
   conscience having compelled even him to become a Christian."

   The document now in our possession corresponds with this evidence of
   Justin and Tertullian. Even in the title it agrees with the account of
   Justin, although, instead of the word acta, which he used, and which is
   manifestly much more Latin than Greek, a Greek expression is employed,
   which can be shown to have been used to indicate genuine Acts. [120]
   The details recounted by Justin and Tertullian are all found in our
   text of the Acts of Pilate, with this variation, that nothing
   corresponds to what is joined to the declaration of the prophet, "They
   dragged him to the seat of judgment, and set him upon it, and said,"
   etc.: besides this, the casting lots for the vesture is expressed
   simply by the allusion to the division of the clothes. We must give
   even closer scrutiny to one point. Justin alludes to the miracles which
   were performed in fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, on the lame,
   the dumb, the blind, the dead, and on lepers. In fact, in our Acts of
   Pilate there are made to appear before the Roman governor a palsied man
   who had suffered for thirty-eight years, and was brought ill a bed by
   young men, and healed on the Sabbath day; [121] a blind man cured by
   the laying on of hands; a cripple who had been restored; a leper who
   had been cleansed; the woman whose issue of blood had been stanched;
   and a witness of the raising of Lazarus from the dead. Of that which
   Tertullian cites, we will adduce merely the passage found in no one of
   our Gospels, that Jesus passed forty days after his resurrection in
   company with his disciples in Galilee. This is indicated in our Acts of
   Pilate, at the end of the fifteenth chapter, where the risen man is
   represented as saying to Joseph, "For forty days go not out of thy
   house; for behold, I go to my brethren in Galilee."

   Every one will perceive how strongly the argument that our Acts of
   Pilate are the same which Justin and Tertullian read is buttressed by
   these unexpected coincidences. The assertion recently made [122]
   requires consequently no labored contradiction that the allusions to
   both men have grown out of their mere suspicion that there was such a
   record as the Acts of Pilate, or out of the circulation of a mere story
   about such a record, while the real work was written as the consequence
   of these allusions at the close of the third century. What an uncommon
   fancy it requires in the two men to coincide so perfectly in a single
   production as is the case in the Acts to which I am now referring! And
   are we to imagine that they referred with such emphasis as they
   employed to the mere creations of their fancy?

   The question has been raised with more justice, whether the production
   in our possession may not have been a copy or free revision of the old
   and primitive one. The modern change in the title has given support to
   this conjecture, for it has occasioned the work to be commonly spoken
   of as the Gospel of Nicodemus. But this title is borne neither by any
   Greek manuscript, the Coptic-Sahidian papyrus, nor the Latin
   manuscripts, with the exception of a few of the most recent. [123] It
   may be traced only subsequently to the twelfth century, although at a
   very early period, in one of the two prefaces attached to the work,
   Nicodemus is mentioned in one place as a Hebrew author, and in another
   as a Greek translator. But aside from the title, the handwriting
   displays great variation, and the two prefaces alluded to above show
   clearly the work of two hands. Notwithstanding this, however, there are
   decisive grounds for holding that our Acts of Pilate contain in its
   main substance the document drawn from Justin. and Tertullian. The
   first of this to be noticed is, that the Greek text, as given in the
   version most widely circulated in the manuscripts, is surprisingly
   corroborated by two documents of the rarest character, and first used
   by myself,--a Coptic-Sahidian papyrus manuscript, and a Latin
   palimpsest,--both probably dating from the fifth century. Such a
   documentary confirmation of their text is possessed by scarcely ten
   works of the collective Greek classic literature. Both of these ancient
   writings make it in the highest degree probable that the Egyptian and
   Latin translations which they contain were executed still earlier. But
   could a work which was held in great consideration in Justin's and
   Tertullian's time, and down to the commencement of the fourth century,
   and which strenuously [124] insists that the Emperor Maximin caused
   other blasphemous Acts of Pilate to be published and zealously
   circulated, manifestly for the purpose of displacing and discrediting
   the older Christian Acts,--could such a work suddenly change its whole
   form, and from the fifth century, to which in so extraordinary a manner
   translators wholly different in character point back with such
   wonderful concurrence, continue in the new form? Contrary as this is to
   all historical criticism, there is in the contents of the work, in the
   singular manner in which isolated and independent details [125] are
   shown to be related to the canonical books, no less than in the
   accordance with the earliest quotations found in Justin and Tertullian,
   [126] a guaranty of the greatest antiquity. There are in the contents,
   also, matters of such a nature that we must confess that they are to be
   traced back to the primitive edition; as, for example, the narrative in
   the first chapter of the bringing forward of the accused. But the whole
   character of the work in our possession. does not deny in toto that
   which we must infer from the statements of Justin and Tertullian. It is
   incorrect, moreover, to draw a conclusion from Justin's designation of
   the Acta which is not warranted by the whole character of the work. The
   Acta, the hupomnemata, are specified in Justin's account, not less than
   in the manuscripts which we possess, as being written under Pontius
   Pilate; and that can signify nothing else than that they were an
   official production, composed under the direct sanction of the Roman
   Governor. Their transmission to the Emperor must be imagined as
   accompanied by a letter of the same character with that which has been
   brought down to us in the Greek and Latin edition, [127] and yet not at
   all similar in purport to the notable Acts of Pilate. It is by no means
   necessary for us to assert that the production in our hands has (with
   the exception of the preface already alluded to) remained free from
   interpolations; for the distinguishing characteristic which it bears is
   the weaving in of much from the synoptic Gospels, and still more from
   John, relative to the last sufferings of Jesus. [128] Is it not stated
   in Justin that the Acts of Pilate reveal the fulfillment of the
   prophecy respecting the resurrection from the dead, as it is given in
   chapter eight of the work in our hands, in the testimony concerning the
   raising of Lazarus? Is it probable that, in order to set John aside, we
   are to believe that in Justin's edition there was recorded one of the
   two other resurrections, of which we have traces preserved for us?

   It would lead us to the denial of an unquestionable fact should we not
   admit the claims of our Acts of Pilate, in their connection with the
   work of the same name known to Justin, to serve as testimony to the
   authority of the Johannean as well as the synoptic Gospels, dating from
   a period prior to Justin, in spite of their frequent use of those
   Gospels. What importance this fact has in enabling us to determine the
   age of our Gospels, and especially that of John, is at once apparent;
   it weighs far more than any verbal extracts made from John in the epoch
   of Justin. If the apocryphal Acts of Pilate must, for the reason that
   Justin cites them in his first Apology to the Roman Emperor, be
   ascribed to the first decades of the second century, they show, by
   their use of and dependence upon the Gospel of John, that the latter
   dates from a period even earlier. This theory throws no light into the
   impenetrable darkness, but, among the many beams which come down from
   the period directly after the age of the apostles, and which illumine
   the most important question of Christianity, this is one of the most
   luminous.

   We might also cite Thomas's Gospel of the Infancy for our purpose.
   Irenæus and Hippolytus [129] both show that it was used by the
   Marcosians and the Naasenians; it was therefore unquestionably one of
   the first results of the productive heresy of that age, and must be
   ascribed to the middle of the second century. Its text we possess only
   in fragments, which are at issue [130] often among themselves, and
   which consequently makes it difficult to ascertain the connection of
   scattered passages with those of the Gospels. The work seems, however,
   to bear witness in one respect to the results of my researches, and not
   in the not unimportant fact that at the time when this book appeared,
   in the middle of the second century, the Gospel canon ordinarily
   accepted was already formed, and the story of the years of Jesus'
   childhood filled up a break in the account of his life. This left a
   district open to historical research, and one which heresy knew well
   how to prize. Besides this there confronts us one fact more, which
   admits of application to the three more or less perfectly personal
   evidences of the Christian Apocraphy. The wide divergence found in
   these, in respect to form as well as substance, to language as well as
   spirit, to delineation as well as conception, bears witness to a sacred
   origin of our canonical Gospels, to which the apocryphal writings are
   related as the last subjoined appendices.

   I might allude here in a single word to the pseudo-Clementine
   literature, whose main work, the Homilies, is certainly to be ascribed
   to the middle of the second century. The establishment of this date
   does not lead to the necessity of drawing any such inferences
   respecting the history of the canon as we drew in the case of the book
   of James and the Acts of Pilate. Still it is very instructive that the
   transition of the Gospel of John into this Judaic-Christian tendency
   record, [131] which was not at all disputed till the year 1853, has
   been shown to be utterly untenable by the discovery by Dressel, at
   Rome, of the concluding portions of it where (xix. 22) John's narrative
   of the man who was born blind is made use of beyond all doubt.

   The elucidation already given respecting the Acts of Pilate and the
   book of James had already brought us to the opening first decades of
   the second century, and compelled us to confess that there was
   1inquestionably use made, at that period, of our Gospels. No one of the
   remaining results of our investigations into the ecclesiastical and
   heretical literature of the second century stood in antagonism with
   this fact. Not only the apocryphal writings already named bring us back
   to that epoch, but a work of great repute in the Christian literature,
   one which from even the close of the second century to the opening of
   the fourth was assigned by such men as Clemens Alexandrinus [132] to
   Holy Writ. It forms a part of the so-called apostolical Fathers,
   regarding which we have already spoken in our discussion of the
   epistles of Ignatius and that of Polycarp. If it really bore rightly
   the name of Barnabas, the companion of Paul, it would, in spite of
   certain unsatisfactory details, be correctly entitled to a place among
   the sacred books of the New Testament. Slight as is the ecclesiastical
   or scientific recognition granted to this claim of authorship, yet the
   assertion is made with confidence, that the epistle beating the name of
   Barnabas is one of the earliest written records which have come down to
   us from the epoch directly subsequent to the life of the apostles. If
   the expressions (in the sixteenth chapter) conjoined with the word of
   prophecy regarding the rebuilding of the City and the Temple are in
   accordance with historical fact, we are brought back from the
   conflicting statements respecting the closing decades of the first
   century and the opening decades of the second, to the first year of
   Hadrian's reign. In its aim and general character the epistle bears the
   closest resemblance, among the books of the New Testament, to the
   Epistle to the Hebrews; it is directed against such Christian converts
   from Judaism, who, while accepting the new covenant, sought to cling to
   the old, and hence felt that they must share with the former
   fellow-believers in the grief over the fall of the Jewish Temple. In
   opposition to them, the epistle, basing itself largely upon Old
   Testament prophecy and authority, arrays the proof that the new
   covenant brought in by Christ had completely done away with the older
   one, and that the latter had merely been, with its temple and whole
   service, an incomplete and temporary type of the new covenant.

   Within the last two centuries scholars have busied themselves much with
   this document, but unfortunately there are lacking in all the Greek
   manuscripts of it, the first five chapters; only an old Latin
   translation, greatly incomplete, [133] supplies the deficiency. And
   exactly in those chapters which are found only in the Latin copy is
   there a passage which has excited great curiosity. "Let us be on our
   guard," thus it reads in the fourth chapter, " that we be not be found
   to be, as it is written, many called but few chosen." "Adtendamus ergo
   ne forte, sicut scriptum est, multi vocati, pauci electi inveniamur."
   The expression, "as it is written," will be readily recognized by the
   reader as a familiar one in the New Testament. It is the phrase which
   always designates the difference between all passages of Holy Writ and
   all others, and was invariably used by the apostles, as well as by the
   Saviour, in citing the Old Testament. If it were ever applied to a
   passage outside of the canon, it only followed that the passage in
   question had been drawn by frequent use into the circle of canonical
   writings, just as, for example, Jude cites from the prophet Enoch. It
   could be publicly transferred to the writings of the apostles, when the
   latter were placed on the same basis with the Old Testament. As soon as
   passages of the Gospels were cited in connection with the phrase, "as
   it is written," it was assumed that they had become canonical. We had
   occasion on a former page to allude to this matter, while referring to
   Justin's arranging the Gospels and the Prophecies side by side, and to
   the epistles of Ignatius; the same formula was also encountered in the
   New Testament quotations of the Naasenians. The words which have been
   cited in the Epistle of Barnabas in connection with the same formula
   are in the Gospel of Matthew, xxii. 14, and xx. 16. If our inference is
   correct, at the time when the Epistle of Barnabas was written, this
   Gospel was regarded as canonical.

   But the Epistle of Barnabas extends back to the highest Christian
   antiquity. And is it possible, some ask, that at so remote a period the
   passage from Matthew should be marked by the characteristics of
   canonization? The doubt conveyed in this question has been materially
   strengthened by the circumstance that the passage has hitherto existed
   only in a Latin form. It was possible to say, therefore, that this
   significant phrase was added by a translator living long subsequently.
   Dr. Credner, in 1832, wrote these literal words: "The form of citation,
   sicut Scriptum est, applied to a book of the New Testament, was wholly
   without usage in that time, and not an instance of it can be found."
   The portion of the Epistle of Barnabas which, contains the passage
   under discussion does not exist at present in the original Greek, but
   only in a Latin translation. It was an easy matter, therefore, for the
   translator to subjoin the current formula of quotation; and from
   internal evidence we must accordingly lay claim to the correctness of
   the text in the passage under consideration, till some one shall show
   satisfactory proof to the contrary. In order to decide the question
   respecting the antiquity of the formula, it was necessary to consult
   the original Greek text. It was destined not to be withheld from the
   Christian world. After lying many hundreds of years among the old
   parchments at the Convent of St. Catherine in the wilderness of Sinai,
   it came to light in a happy hour; for with the Sinaitic Bible, the
   whole of the Epistle of Barnabas was discovered in the original Greek.
   And what is the decision which it gives respecting the subject under
   discussion? It decides that the writer of the epistle himself placed
   the important Christian-classic expression, "as it is written," before
   the quotation from Matthew, and that it was not the work of the
   translator.

   After this important fact was established, a new question arose,
   namely, whether important inferences could be drawn unconditionally
   from this phrase. Could not the formula, "as it is written," be
   accepted as referring to any book? How little ground there is for this
   I have already shown in my explanations of the use to be made of this
   formula; and we have no right to weaken its force in the present
   instance. But are we also compelled to recognize its relation to the
   passage from Matthew? What would be more evident, if we are to escape
   the assaults of unsound and partisan criticism? A writer of this class
   has brought forward a notion which once brought down the scorn of
   Credner [134] upon it, namely, that the quotation of Barnabas's Epistle
   is to be referred to the fourth book of Ezra, quoted elsewhere in the
   Epistle. [135] There, in the eighth chapter, it is expressly stated
   according to the Latin and Ethiopian text, "nam multi creati sunt (in
   the Ethiop., besides, in eo, i. e. mundo) pauci autem
   salvabuntur,"--for many have been born, but few shall be saved. In
   spite of the applause which this [136] has received in a certain
   quarter, it only shows to what wanton fancies the opposition brought
   against the age of our evangelical canon leads men. The visible
   absurdity of referring a citation, taken word for word from Matthew, to
   a passage in a book of Ezra, written twenty years earlier [137] and
   having quite a different meaning, is carried so far that the expression
   of the Saviour in Matthew is degraded into a mere "Christian
   interpretation" of the passage in Ezra. [138] That Matthew is referred
   to elsewhere in the Epistle is supposed not to have its weight in
   strengthening the citation from him accompanied by the canonical
   formula, but to prove, on the contrary, that Barnabas, with all Iis
   acquaintance with Matthew, did not hold his work to be a sacred book.
   [139] It is forgotten that quite often we meet in the later Fathers, in
   connection with direct and express quotations, the same weaving in of a
   biblical clause that we have in Barnabas; and in these cases the reader
   is pre-supposed to have that familiarity with Scripture which will
   enable him to determine what it is which is thus woven in, without its
   being definitely pointed out with words or signs of quotation. Thus,
   for example, in chapter five of Barnabas's Epistle, we have the
   expression, "He chose for his disciples, to go forth and announce his
   gospel, men full of sin and unrighteousness, in order to show that he
   had not come to call the righteous, but sinners; and therefore he
   revealed himself as the Son of God." What reader of these words could
   fail to see in them the reflection of what our Saviour says in Matt.
   ix. 13, "I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
   repentance"? [140] We have, moreover, in the twelfth chapter, "Since it
   is a thing in the e future [141] that men shall say that Christ is
   David's son, therefore David himself, comprehending in advance the
   error which sinners will make, says, 'The Lord says unto my Lord, sit
   thou here on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool.'"
   Could Barnabas write this without presupposing that his readers would
   have Matt. xxii. 41, et sq. in mind? And in this presupposition is not
   the recognition of the authority of the then extant Gospel of Matthew
   taken for granted? And if in the same twelfth chapter of Matthew it is
   shown how Moses lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness in
   typification of the Saviour, "who should suffer (die) and yet himself
   give life to others," it is directly obvious that Barnabas was making
   use of the truth hinted at in John iii. 14, even if the phrase, taken
   word by word, fails to show this. It is possible indeed that the writer
   of this Epistle wrote independently in this case, as in many others;
   and yet we are justified in assuming the very great probability that he
   had the passage of John in mind: still, in assuming this, it by no
   means follows that his Epistle is written in the same tone as that of
   John's, and was a reflex of it. The disproportionate number of express
   quotations from the Old Testament found in Barnabas is in direct
   relation with the whole character of his Epistle: and no inference can
   be drawn from it, which invalidates the canonization [142] of the
   Gospels.

   Does, then, the fact indicated by the Epistle of Barnabas, that the
   Gospel of Matthew was reckoned a part of Holy Writ prior to the year
   120, come into hazardous conflict with the results already gained by us
   in our study of the second century? It is needless to try to answer
   such a question. There is only downright gain to our side, and that of
   a new and important link in the chain of proofs supporting the very
   earliest acceptance of the credibility of the Gospels; a new barrier
   erected against the idle vagaries of conjecture which have hitherto
   been allowed to float around and hide the history of the New Testament
   canon.

   But are we compelled to limit to Matthew the authenticity thus granted
   to his canonical value? By no means. All our studies respecting the
   history of the canon lead to this result, that the attempt was not made
   in the infancy of the church to raise any one of the Gospels, taken
   exclusively, to the rank of canonical writings. For we saw, in the
   first half of the second century, now Matthew, now John, now Luke, or
   one taken in connection with another, come into the foreground; and
   this shows conclusively that at that epoch no one was credited while
   another was discredited. The small compass, too, of the literature
   which has come down to us from that time, and the character of the
   Gospels, taken separately,--Matthew, for example, being incomparably
   better adapted for quotation than Mark,--lead to the inference that the
   one bears witness to the equal worth of the other. And we learned, too,
   from Justin's use of the Acts of Pilate about the year 140, that the
   Gospel of John, so much used, not only in those Acts which were written
   some few decades before Justin's Apology, but also in connection with
   the synoptic Gospels, must be assigned to the opening of the second
   century, Justin himself having often made use of John, and still more
   frequently of Matthew. Is not this alone satisfactory proof that if, at
   the time when the Epistle of Barnabas was written, Matthew had attained
   to canonical authority, John too must have had the same? Basilides used
   John and Luke at the time of Hadrian; Valentin, about 140, John,
   Matthew, and Luke; and are there not safe inferences to be drawn thence
   that these writers are in close alliance?

   To this must be added the fact that we so early and so repeatedly find,
   as, for example, in Justin and Agrippa Castor, the separate Gospels
   united in one whole, and that, in view of the collective and grand
   character thus given to this whole, the name and individuality of each
   writer are thrown into the background, but that, on the other hand,
   Justin refers occasionally to the discrimination made, at a later day,
   by Tertullian, in the character of the four Evangelists, according to
   which some were the real disciples of the Lord, and the others
   apostolical companions. And how are we to understand otherwise that
   soon after the middle of the second century Harmonies of the Four
   Gospels were prepared, and that in Irenæus----not to lose sight of
   him--the four are unitedly subjected to comment, without the least hint
   of there being superior or inferior value on the part of the separate
   Gospels? Is there the faintest indication that, in the course of the
   second century, the church, while discussing many issues which are
   reported to us, took up and passed its judgment upon the Gospel
   canon,--a fundamental matter; while, before the close of that century,
   the same canon meets us everywhere as having been long accepted?

   But when, then, are we to consider that the canon passed into general
   acceptance? Everything compels us to assign it to the close of the
   first century, or to the opening years of the second. That was the time
   when, with the death of the aged [143] John, all the revered men who
   had stood in personal relations with Jesus, and Paul too, the great
   apostle to the Gentiles, had passed away, and could no longer give
   their direct authority in all ecclesiastical matters to the young
   church; the time when the church was outgrowing its old home, and
   stretching wider and wider out, convulsed within by various movements,
   and pressed upon without by hostile assaults,--then it was that men
   began to consecrate and regard with hallowing veneration the writings
   which the founders of the church had left behind them, gather them up
   as imperishable bequests, as well-authenticated evidences of the life
   and teachings of the Saviour, the most precious types of what men's
   faith and practice should be. The fit time had evidently come to put
   these writings on the same basis as that of the old covenant. The
   complete separation of the church from the synagogue had taken place:
   subsequently to the destruction of Jerusalem and of its temple (about
   the year 70), the church had been thrown more decidedly upon itself,
   and lad become more independent; and it was a significant sign of this
   independence to ascribe to the writings which recorded the life of the
   Saviour and the deeds of his followers the same sanctity which had long
   invested the sacred documents of the synagogue, on which Christianity
   was based.

   Do we ask in what way this has taken place? It certainly is not a
   question which needs much time to enable us to answer it. If men like
   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John left on record statements respecting the
   life of our Lord, who would not have recognized them at once as a
   precious bequest to the church, and gratefully accepted them? Did it
   require more than their honored names to insure for their writings the
   greatest veneration by the whole church? And had not these men all
   stood in close enough personal relations with the church to insure the
   latter against receiving any works which should be unauthentic, and
   palmed off by trickery? And of no Gospel is this more true than of
   John's. Suppose that it did proceed from the midst of his Asia Minor
   congregations, and pass into the possession of wider circles; could the
   least suspicion of a want of genuineness fasten to it? But in case it
   did not proceed from his own congregations, would the latter not have
   detected the imposition at once? It was impossible to bring them to
   accept an unauthentic word of their own bishop; certainly not by
   deception. But we have the bishop who followed John at Ephesus as one
   of the witnesses to the authenticity of his Gospel. For if Polycrates,
   bishop of Ephesus in the last quarter of the second century, in a
   letter addressed to Victor of Rome (Eus. Hist. Eccl. v. 24), alludes to
   the apostle buried in Ephesus, and characterized him with the same
   expression which is used in John xiii. 23 and 25, "who leaned on the
   Lord's bosom,"--there is beyond all doubt a confirmation of the Gospel.
   As to the rest, that John was the last who wrote is evidenced not only
   by the very ancient tradition that he was the one whose name was always
   mentioned after the others, as we have seen to be the case in the hints
   drawn from Muratori, in Irenæus, and in the oldest Greek manuscripts,
   [144] but Clemens Alexandrinus and Eusebius give distinct expression to
   it in what they have communicated to us respecting the circumstances
   which gave rise to that Gospel. In the first of these latter writers
   (see Eus. vi. 14), the wish of friends is represented as prompting the
   more spiritual-minded disciple to add a fourth Gospel to the other
   three, for the purpose of recording more distinctly the workings of
   Jesus' spirit. According to the latter (iii. 24), while confessing the
   truth and authentic value of the first three Gospels, he is represented
   as omitting what relates more exclusively to the public activity of
   Jesus, and giving a needful compliment to the evangelical narrative.

   Since, then, the writings left behind by the apostles stand at the very
   outset in the personal authority of the writers, this authority of
   course only grew in magnitude after the decease of the persons who have
   personally been the representatives of the spirit of the Gospel. Out of
   the vital development of the church grew the primitive canon of the New
   Testament, and took its place side by side with the Old. It would be
   easy to admit that such a canon, in accordance with its evangelical
   character (not to speak here of its other features), would naturally
   fall within the time which has been assigned, viz., the close of the
   first century: this, however, we should not be able to settle
   definitely [145] unless the history and literature of the whole second
   proved such a cogent argument in its favor.

   There is yet one thing more to add to what has already been said
   respecting the oldest Christian literature. It is the evidence which
   Papias gives, and which, more than any other, has beet misused by the
   opponents of our Gospels. The want of positive knowledge which rests
   upon this man, as well as upon his testimony, makes him not a fit
   subject to be taken either independently or in antagonism with other
   witnesses.

   From Eusebius (iii. 39) we learn, confirmed as it is by Irenæus (v. 33:
   4), that Papias composed a work in five books, which he called an
   Exposition of the sayings of our Lord. [146] While he was collecting
   the materials for this work he believed that his task was not so much
   to cull what was to be found in written records as in unwritten
   tradition; and, according to his own assurance, he drew especially from
   those oral accounts which could be traced back to the apostles. These
   are his own words regarding his book: "I shall arrange with assiduity
   whatever I may gather from the presbyters (elders), and retain in
   memory, while aiming to ascertain the truth of the same by means of
   personal investigation. For I did not find my pleasure, as most do, in
   those who have much to tell, but in those who teach the truth; not in
   those who bring forward what is strange, and out of the usual course
   (ta, allotrias entolas), but in those who surrender themselves
   absolutely to the truth, [147] and claim lineage with what is true.
   Whenever, therefore, I fell in with those who used to be on intimate
   terms with the presbyters, I made special inquiries as to what Andrew,
   or Peter, or Philip, or Thomas, or James, or John, or Matthew, or any
   other disciple of the Lord, or as to what Aristion and John the
   presbyter, disciples also, have to say. [148] For I believed that the
   books (ta ek ton biblion) would not be of so much service to me in
   giving exhaustive information as the living word of men (quantum ex
   hominum adhuc superstitum voce)."

   This passage of Papias is obscure in various ways, and on this account
   I have endeavored to translate it literally. The first and most
   important point to settle is, who the elders or "presbyters" were.
   Papias alludes to them as his vouchers, whom he used in part directly,
   in part indirectly. Are the apostles themselves to be regarded as
   covered by the expression? It is supposed by many that they are; but
   this notion is absolutely denied and rendered untenable by Eusebius.
   For, after stating that Irenæus designates Papias as a "hearer of John
   and companion of Polycarp," he qualifies his words by saying, "But
   Papias has by no means represented him in the preface of his book as
   one who himself heard and saw the holy apostles: he teaches, on the
   contrary, that he had received the matters of faith (ta tes pisteos)
   from those who had had personal acquaintance with them (para ton
   ekeinois gnorimon). In like manner, he says, a little farther on in the
   same chapter (iii. 39: 4), Papias insists that he received the words of
   the apostles from their own followers, and says that he himself drew
   from the lips [149] of Aristion and the presbyter John; adding this,
   that Papias often mentions these by name when giving in his book the
   communications which they made. It is not only incredible that Eusebius
   erred in this, it was, indeed, scarcely possible for him to do so. For,
   as he had the whole work of Papias before him, and was making
   selections for his own purposes, it could scarcely escape him, if
   Papias, in one case or another, appealed to the direct communication of
   an apostle, clear as it was to him that he had known Aristion and the
   presbyter John. And how wholly differently would he have brought
   forward in his preface his vouchers, had they been the apostles! he
   surely would not have written, as he has, words which are capable of a
   double interpretation, if he had been referring directly to them. In
   the whole passage, however, the presbyters are set in contrast with the
   apostles; and yet the clause, ''the disciples of the Lord," subjoined
   to the names Aristion and John the presbyter, makes the meaning of this
   expression obscure; at least rendering a double interpretation of it
   possible. And is it credible that Papias should say that he would
   confirm with his own declarations the statement of the apostles?
   Respecting the words of the presbyters, he could say this with the more
   justice, because, as his own words and the declaration of Eusebius
   show, he was able to use of these only Aristion and John; but in the
   case of the others, he had to rely on what was communicated indirectly.
   Irenæus brings evidence confirmatory of this way of interpreting the
   term "presbyters;" for he derives the tradition of the "wanton luxury
   of the kingdom of a thousand years" expressly from the mouth of "the
   presbyters who had seen John, the disciple of the Lord," and confirms
   this by appealing directly to the writings of Papias. Granting in this
   way that he was a hearer of John and a friend of Polycarp, it is
   perfectly clear that the presbyters in Irenæus have the same
   signification as in Papias, and that they are not for an instant to be
   confounded with the apostles. [150] This inference respecting Papias
   which is found in Irenæus rests in the greatest probability on no other
   ground than the statement of Papias himself, carefully drawn up by
   Eusebius, but carelessly used by Irenæus; but that he confounded the
   apostle John, as his manner of speaking would indicate, is consistent
   with the fact that, as can be shown, the personality of the presbyter
   John, who likewise lived and died at Ephesus, was forgotten at a very
   early day. [151] We ought not to overlook the chronological difficulty
   connected with the supposition that Papias, who, according to the
   oldest testimony, suffered martyrdom about the same time as Polycarp,
   i. e. 165, was not able to collect the materials for his work among
   surviving apostles (para ton presbuteron). How little the contents, so
   far as we know them, correspond to what we should expect from a work
   written by a disciple of the apostles, who is recording what he learned
   from their own lips, may be judged from what we will proceed to give.

   Eusebius cites explicitly from the contents of that work of Papias,
   that the daughters of Philip informed him at Hierapolis of the
   resurrection of a dead man immediately subsequently to their father's
   time, and that Justus Barsabbas had drunken a goblet of poison without
   experiencing any injury. (Both of these accounts might be brought into
   relation with expressions of our Lord, as in fulfillment of them.) In
   addition, Papias asserted (we give the accounts in Eusebius iii. 39: 5
   literally) that he had learned many things through oral tradition, as
   well as some unknown (xenas, strange) parables and teachings of the
   Lord, and other things, which were all too fabulous" (muthikotera). To
   this class Eusebius assigns the doctrine of a kingdom of a thousand
   years' duration, which was to appear sensible on the earth after the
   resurrection of the dead. The representation of this kingdom was not
   given by Eusebius, but by Irenæus. It runs as follows: "Then shall come
   the days in which vinestocks shall appear, each one putting forth ten
   thousand branches, each branch ten thousand shoots, each shoot ten
   thousand clusters of grapes, and each cluster twenty-five measures of
   wine; and if one of the saints should try to take hold of one of the
   clusters, another of the latter will cry, I am better; lay hold of me,
   and praise the Lord by me. In like manner, an ear of corn will bring
   forth ten thousand ears, and each ear ten thousand grains," etc. This
   representation is made by Papias, as Irenæus testifies, to refer to the
   "elders," and, through them, even to John. Eusebius remarks, in
   reference to it, that Papias, a man of very inconsiderable mental
   parts, as his whole book shows, gathered his notions from
   misapprehended expressions of the apostles. He then goes on to say that
   there are other sayings of the Lord, dating from Aristion and John the
   presbyter, recorded in the book of Papias; but he refers those who may
   be interested in them to the work itself. To this he adds that he will
   subjoin to what has been already cited what he has learned respecting
   Mark. This runs, "And this says the presbyter: "Mark, the interpreter
   of Peter, wrote carefully down all that he recollected, but not
   according to (taxei) the order of Christ's speaking or working; for he
   neither heard Christ, nor was a direct follower of him, but of Peter,
   as already intimated, who always held his discourses as circumstances
   made it expedient, but do not seek to arrange the sayings of the Lord
   in any regular order. Mark accomplished all that he purposed in writing
   what he had to record just as he remembered it. There was one thing,
   however, which he did keep in mind; that was, not to omit anything that
   he had heard, or to falsify anything which he undertook to set down."
   To this statement of Papias, which, judging by its tone, possibly only
   refers in its first part to the presbyter, Eusebius subjoins a second
   statement respecting Matthew, as follows: "This is what Papias records
   respecting Mark; but of Matthew he says, 'Matthew recorded in the
   Hebrew language the sayings of the Lord, but he translated every one of
   them as best he could." In these words much is obscure: especially
   doubtful is it whether we have rightfully translated "sayings of the
   Lord;" [152] at least the casual words of Mark, "what Christ spoke and
   did," would seem to make it probable that both acts and words were
   comprehended under the single word "sayings." But do these expressions
   of the presbyter and of Papias--and this is the main question--relate
   to the two Gospels in our possession bearing the names of Matthew and
   Mark? And if the expression, "sayings of the Lord," is to remain
   unmolested, it does not follow that a historical clothing of these
   sayings is to be excluded, since neither Eusebius nor any other
   theologian of Christian antiquity supposed that the words of Papias
   stood in antagonism with the two Gospels. If in our time the inference
   has been drawn from the words of Papias, that our Gospel according to
   Mark is to be regarded only in a secondary sense as the work of Mark,
   and is to be regarded as a subsequent revision of a work once written
   by Mark, but which was lost sight of at a very early date, the idea
   would show itself to be a manifest freak of fancy. It would have no
   other mission than to open to the freest play of conjecture all our
   investigations respecting the origin and the mutual relations of our
   three synoptical Gospels.

   True as this is of Mark, it is no less true of Matthew. The statement
   of Papias has its point in this, that it ascribes only a Hebrew text to
   Matthew even. If this statement have a satisfactory basis, even if we
   accept the other, viz., that every one translated it as well as he
   could, it leaves a broad margin between the primitive Hebrew and our
   Greek Matthew. That Hebrew text, like the primitive Mark, must have
   been lost at a very early date, as not a single one of the church
   Fathers saw or used it. This gives rise to one of the most intricate of
   questions, the discussion of which, however, would not be in place
   here. We, on our side, are fully satisfied in the matter, being
   convinced that the acceptance by Papias of a primitive Hebrew text of
   Matthew (a view which may not have been limited to him, and may have
   been repeated by others) rested entirely upon a misunderstanding. I
   will briefly indicate of what character it was, and whence it arose.
   The Judo-Christian struggles which sprung into being during the
   lifetime of the apostle Paul come more and more markedly into the
   foreground. There were two parties specially prominent: that of the
   Nazaræans was more moderate than the one more closely allied to
   philosophical speculation, the Ebionites. Both made use of a Gospel
   which bore the name of Matthew, the former in the Hebrew language, the
   latter in the Greek, the same document to which reference was made on a
   preceding page as the Gospel of the Hebrews. That they did not hesitate
   to make modifications according to their own taste, in the text as they
   originally received it, is clear from the standpoint which they
   occupied, that of being the only sect characterized by strong
   self-will. And what we have really learned of this Gospel shows, as
   already stated, not only the great similarity to our Matthew, but also
   arbitrary deviations which have been made from him in some instances.
   When it was said later--I mean in the course of the second
   century--that the Nazaræans, a race dating from the very emergence of
   Christianity, possessed Matthew in the Hebrew, what was more natural
   than for one and another to assume, wholly in accordance with the
   claims of the Judo-Christian heretics, that Matthew himself wrote in
   Hebrew, and that the Greek text, the one which was circulated not only
   in the church, but among other Judo-Christians, was a translation? No
   one knew, no one made inquiries how divergent the two versions were;
   and not only were such investigations foreign to the character of the
   times, but the exclusiveness of the Nazaræans especially drew them away
   from such researches, making their home, as they did, apart, in the
   neighborhood of the Dead Sea.

   Jerome gives us the benefit of his support in this explanation of the
   statement of Papias. Jerome, who was especially skilled in Hebrew,
   gained the temporary use of a Hebrew Gospel of the Nazaræans, and at
   once proclaimed that that was the primitive text of Matthew. Going
   deeper into the matter, however, he simply said that many held this
   Hebrew text to be the original from Matthew's own hand; he translated
   it, moreover, into Greek and Latin, and made some comments upon it.
   From these, as well as from some fragments preserved by the Fathers of
   the church, it may be shown that the view represented by many scholars
   of late, and in a certain sense shared with Papias, that the so-called
   Hebrew Gospel is older than Matthew, must be received in its very
   opposite form; that that Hebrew book is a perversion of our Greek
   Matthew, whose record bears the marks in the whole of its diction, and
   especially in the form of its Old Testament quotations, of being no
   translation, but an original. That same independence of our Matthew is
   to be marked in the Greek version of the Hebrew Gospel current among
   the Ebionites, only with this distinction, that here the heretical
   character may, in consequence of the various hands which executed it,
   have assumed a more decided character. Being in Greek, it was better
   known in the church than the Hebrew version; and in the very earliest
   epoch it was held to be another text of Matthew. This agrees with what
   Papias wrote respecting the various versions of Matthew, among which he
   reckoned the Greek Matthew then held by the church.

   There is still more to be said of Papias and his work. In relation to
   his efforts to obtain materials he wrote that he believed that less was
   needed in consequence of what was already written in books. To what
   books did he refer? May it not have been our own Gospels? The
   expression used would make this not impossible, but the whole character
   of the book would render it in the highest degree improbable; for he
   made no secret of his object of preparing, on the ground of what was
   then, about A. D. 130 or 140, [153] related regarding the Saviour, a
   kind of supplement to the Gospels, and he may or may not have directed
   special reference to the prophetical allusions to the Lord. The
   Gospels, therefore, he could not have used as sources, and as affording
   materials for his collections. The books referred to by him must be
   understood as rather relating to unauthentic and more or less
   apocryphal records of the Lord's career, of which there were so many
   from the earliest date. These he set over against the oral
   communications which he had received, whose authenticity, as it could
   be traced through the elders back to the apostles themselves, like the
   evangelical writings, seemed to be unquestionable.

   From that part of Papias's work which Eusebius thought was worth
   preserving, I have already cited the story of the resurrection from the
   dead which the daughters of Philip asserted that they had heard of
   their father, and also the account of Justus Barsabbas and the poison.
   In a third passage, where the Gospel of the Hebrews gives its
   corroborative evidence, he repeats the story of a woman who had been
   accused before Jesus of sin. In like manner it was stated in his book,
   as we learn of Catenen and OEkumenius, that Judas the betrayer was of
   such monstrous corpulence that he was crushed by a carriage in a narrow
   street, and that his bowels gushed out in consequence. Regarding the
   further contents of the book, Eusebius informs us, as already remarked,
   that, in addition to a few matters altogether fabulous, it contained a
   few parables and sayings of our Lord, hitherto unknown but utterly
   unworthy of being recorded; and no ecclesiastical writer has done so,
   excepting in the case of Irenæus's strange account of the kingdom which
   should last a thousand years. In addition to this, Anastasius Sinaita
   has called attention to the fact that Papias has made the days of
   creation and paradise refer to Christ and the church; and Andrew the
   Cappadocian, in his Commentary on the Apocalypse, quoted a remark of
   Papias respecting the angels who had been unfaithful to their trust in
   the government of the world. The latter writer, as does Arethas also,
   cites the authority of Papias in support of the credibility (Arethas
   uses the word "inspiration") of the Apocalypse. [154]

   In view of all that has been said above, is Papias's book one which can
   be accepted as throwing important light upon the history of our
   Gospels? The judgment of Eusebius respecting the man, that he was of
   limited understanding, is justified not only by the details which are
   brought into view, but confirmed by the fact that his alleged
   contributions to our evangelical literature have been utterly
   disregarded by the church. What would not a single parable of the Lord
   be worth if its authenticity could be substantiated! But no one has
   taken the slightest notice of all that has been recorded by Papias; the
   fabulous character which Eusebius charges upon the book--a man himself
   characterized by extreme critical acumen--has adhered to the whole
   work, and it is very unfair to trace this charge to a prepossession in
   favor of the Chiliasts. The question which has been raised we must
   answer in the negative, in view not only of the character of the man
   but also of the tendency of his book, although the passage referring to
   Matthew and Mark shows that that sort of matter was not absolutely
   excluded. However much to be wished, however important it is to see
   light thrown upon that very early Christian literature of which we find
   indications in the preface to Luke, in order to enable us to see the
   origin and the mutual relation of our synoptic Gospels cleared up, yet
   there is no use to be made of Papias's statements so far as they stand
   alone and in contradiction to the sufficiently authenticated facts of
   his time. If he has nevertheless become a torch-bearer of critical
   theology in our time, and a leader under whose guidance we can be
   content to see the first two Gospels divided up into what are called
   their authentic and unauthentic constituent parts, there is little
   result gained thereby other than the rearing of an undeserved memorial
   to the bishop of Hierapolis.

   Papias is the most acceptable and important ally of the opponents of
   John's Gospel. And why? Papias is silent respecting this Gospel.
   Strauss and Renan, with their followers, [155] make great account of
   this silence as opposed to the belief in the authenticity of John's
   Gospel, and evidently consider it something which can not be
   surmounted. I fear that my readers would not find it so after what has
   been said above respecting the value of Papias's book. Does it not
   betray--I ask the reader himself--complete ignorance of what Papias has
   said regarding his own undertaking, to quote him as evidence against
   the Gospel of John? His remarks respecting Mark and Matthew make no
   difference in the character of his whole book. It is insisted, however,
   that Papias can not, from his silence, have known anything about the
   Gospel of John, still less have acknowledged its authenticity.
   Naturally here was supposed to be nothing less than decisive evidence
   against the genuineness of this Gospel yet Papias, the bishop of
   Hierapolis, belonged even to the neighborhood of Ephesus, whence John's
   Gospel must have gone forth into the world, and his work can scarcely
   have been written prior to the middle of the second century. A more
   groundless and trivial demand can hardly be made than to grant that the
   silence of Papias respecting the Gospel of John constitutes a strong
   argument against its genuineness. For, in the first place, to give
   evidence respecting this Gospel formed no part whatever of the plan of
   Papias; and in the second place, from the fact that Eusebius has cited
   nothing from Papias's book respecting it, no inference can justly be
   drawn that there was nothing in that book which related to John's
   Gospel. The remarks respecting Mark and Matthew are not cited by
   Eusebius in confirmation of the genuineness of their Gospels, but
   simply in consequence of certain facts which they touch upon. In the
   case of John--and this is the only inference which can be rationally
   drawn from the silence of Eusebius--there were no circumstances which
   made it necessary to cite what related to him.

   Since, however, the opponents of John's Gospel have made so much
   account of the silence of Eusebius in this matter, I can not refrain
   from laying before the reader the great error into which they have
   fallen. They completely overlook the purpose which Eusebius had in view
   in writing. Respecting his object he expresses himself plainly enough
   (iii. 3: 2), where he says that he wanted to trace in the
   ecclesiastical writers what portion of the Antilegomena of the New
   Testament they had made use of, and what they have said about the
   Homologoumena, as well as what does not fall under this head. [156]
   Every one can see that this does not mean that he meant to inquire
   which writings, both of the Antileogomena as well as the Homologoumena,
   they had used. In the case of the Antilegomena, or New Testament
   writings of doubtful authority, the object is to indicate the use of
   passages cited, and in this way to make clear that this or that
   document was recognized. A similar effort is not made by him in the
   case of the Homologoumena, or writings invariably recognized as
   authentic, but he seeks as earnestly as in the case of the other class,
   to collect ancient references to them, and what was anciently known
   respecting them. That this construction of his purpose is the only
   correct one, Eusebius shows not only in the case of Papias, but of all
   other writers who happen to come under his notice. He never says
   respecting any one of the Gospels, This one or that one has made use of
   it: this is much oftener the case in the allusion to the Catholic
   Epistles, [157] than to the Hebrews and the Apocalypse. But when he
   cites what he finds in the older writers relative to the Gospels, he
   brings forward all that refers to their origin, the time when they were
   written, and the occasion which gave them birth. This is the ease with
   Irenæus, of whom Eusebius writes (v. 8) the following: "Matthew wrote
   his Gospel among the Hebrews, in their own language, while Peter and
   Paul were preaching in Rome and strengthening the church. After their
   death, Mark, the disciple aid interpreter of Peter, wrote, recording
   what Peter had preached. Luke, the companion of Paul, took down the
   Gospel as it was announced by the latter, and subsequently John, the
   disciple who lay on the Lord's breast, wrote his Gospel during his
   sojourn at Ephesus." Very instructive, moreover, are the extracts from
   Clement. Eusebius says (vi. 14) that Clement briefly treats in his
   Hypotyposa all the biblical writings, not passing over the
   Antilegomena. "I mean," he goes on to say literally, "the Epistle of
   Jude, the other Catholic Epistles, that of Barnabas, and the Revelation
   ascribed to Peter." He allows the Epistle to the Hebrews to have been
   written by Paul, but in the Hebrew language. After further remarks
   respecting this Epistle, Eusebius goes on to say: "But in the same
   treatise Clement communicates a tradition of the following import
   respecting the true order of the Gospels; those were first written
   which contain a genealogical record. Mark's Gospel, moreover, had the
   following origin: When Peter was publicly preaching in Rome, and,
   filled with the Spirit, was announcing the Gospel, Mark was urged by
   many who were present, to put on record the statements of Peter, since
   he had long been Peter's companion and could remember the substance of
   his discourses; and when in accordance with this request he wrote his
   Gospel, he communicated it to those who had asked for it. Peter on his
   part, when he learned what Mark was doing, neither took ground against
   it, nor urged him to continue in it. And John, when he saw that that
   physical, active side of the Saviour had been fully delineated in the
   first three Gospels, gratified the wish of friends that he should
   portray Jesus on the spiritual sides This is what Clemens
   communicates." We add to this what Eusebius (vi. 35) has taken, of,
   similar purport, from Origen: that from tradition he had gathered that
   one of the four Gospels which had universal credence in God's church on
   earth, the one bearing the name of Matthew, at first a collector of
   customs and then an apostle of Jesus, was the one first written; and
   that it was composed in the Hebrew tongue and dedicated to believers
   who had come out from Judaism. The second in the order of the writing
   was Mark's, who had followed Peter's lead, and whom Peter himself
   recognizes in his catholic epistle as his son,--"My son Mark greeteth
   you." The third was Luke's, defended by Paul, and prepared for the use
   of those who were converted from heathendom. All these were followed by
   the one which bears the name of John.

   Now does not a glance show that all these passages from Irenæus,
   Clemens and Origen were not quoted by Eusebius for the purpose of
   proving the genuineness of the Gospels, and just as little what Papias
   has to say about Mark and Matthew, but that they were recorded merely
   as interesting facts relative to the distinctive history of each one of
   the evangelical records?

   But we have the most striking confirmation of our view in extracts from
   writers still older, whose clear and distinct testimony to our Gospels
   and other Homologoumena, such as the Pauline Epistles, are passed over
   by Eusebius in accordance with his general design, while he records
   what seemed to him to support the Antilegomena. Here Papias himself is
   at the head; at any rate Eusebius remarks expressly respecting him at
   the end of his treatise, that he had used proof texts from the First
   Epistle of John, and also from that Of Peter. [158] Further he says
   (iv. 18: 3) of Justin, that he had borne in mind the Apocalypse of
   John, and expressly allowed that it was written by the apostle; but of
   the quotations from the Gospels found in him, he does not have a
   syllable. From Polycarp's Epistle to the Philippians he draws the
   statement (iv. 14) that he was indebted for many proof texts to the
   First Epistle of Peter; but of the far more numerous Pauline,
   citations, taken from the majority of Paul's Epistles, he says nothing.
   [159] Of Clemens Romanus he remarks that he had taken many ideas from
   the Epistle to the Hebrews, and often in the original words, while he
   passes in silence over all quotations from the Pauline Epistles. From
   the three books of Theophilus to Autolycus, and from the one directed
   against the heresy of Hermogenes, he cites (iv. 14) nothing further
   than that in the latter he makes use of passages in the Apocalypse of
   John; and yet Theophilus often and unmistakably uses the Pauline
   Epistles (e. g. Rom. ii. 6, et seq. ad Autolyc. i. 14; Rom. xiii. 7, et
   sq. ad Autolyc. iii. 14); he even (and this is the most pertinent to
   our needs) cites the Gospel of John under that very appellation.

   With all this, do we not apprehend the aim of what Eusebius records?
   And may we not steer clear of the long-continued perversion [160] of
   his purpose? On our part, we are of the firm conviction that it needs
   only an upright determination to discern the truth as it is in order to
   see the complete worthlessness of this famous Papias argument against
   the Gospel of John.

   The absurdity of the argument that the unfortunate Bishop of
   Hierapolis, shortly before the middle of the second century, knew
   nothing of the writings of Luke and the Epistles of Paul, because,
   judging by Eusebius's silence, he made no mention of them, has been
   long perceived; but very recently it has been set aside [161] by those
   who are the rudest opponents of ecclesiasticism, on the ground that the
   bishop may have been silent about things which he knew, but which
   seemed too trivial to mention. Still less trouble has it caused this
   party that, according to Eusebius's express testimony, Papias made use
   of the First Epistle of John. In the place, some pages back, where we
   had. occasion to refer to Polycarp's use of this same Epistle, it was
   said that the evidence in favor of this Epistle is equally applicable
   to the Gospels; but we asserted that not only had the identity of
   authorship in these two treatises been called into question, but that
   there has been a hasty impulse to cast the Epistle itself overboard.
   Thus Papias's silence was to bring the Gospel into utter disrepute,
   while, with his distinct testimony, he could not shield the Epistle
   from the attacks of overbearing critics.

   In view of such proceedings, it is a genuine satisfaction to know that
   there has recently been brought to light a work printed long ago, but
   quite forgotten, in which Papias and his book give direct testimony in
   behalf of the Gospel, which is assaulted under the protection of his
   name. It is a prologue to the Gospel of John in a Latin manuscript of
   the Vatican (leaf 244), which, by a note in an old hand, is traced back
   to the possession of the Bohemian, Duke Wenceslaus (iste liber creditur
   fuisse Divi Venceslai Ducis Boemiæ), and which, according to the
   appearances of the writing, dates from the ninth century. It is now
   designated Vat. Alex. No. 14. [162] The prologue discloses that it was
   composed prior to the time of Jerome, and begins with the words,
   "Evangelium iohannis manifestatum et datum est ecclesiis ab iohanne
   adhuc in corpore constituto, sicut papias nomine hierapolitanus
   discipulus iohannis carus in exotericis id est in extremis quinque
   libris retulit." There can be no stronger testimony than this that
   Papias did give evidence in behalf of John's Gospel. The further
   purport of the prologue is, with all its brevity, rich in surprising
   facts. That it sprang from the work of Papias seems, however, on more
   grounds than one, to be doubtful; and on this account the credibility
   of the other matters which it communicates can not be put on the same
   footing with the first. [163]

   Before leaving Papias, however, we must revert to one source of
   evidence in favor of John's Gospel, which Irenæus (v. 36: 2) cites even
   from the lips of the presbyters, those high authorities of Papias: "And
   on this account they say that the Lord used the expression, 'In my
   Father's house are many mansions'" (John xiv. 2). As the presbyters put
   this expression [164] in connection with the degrees of elevation
   granted to the just in the City of God, in Paradise, in Heaven,
   according as they bring their thirty, sixty, or a hundred-fold from the
   harvest, so nothing is more probable than that Irenæus borrowed this
   whole expression of the presbyter, together with the portraiture
   already referred to of the kingdom of a thousand years, from the work
   of Papias. Whether it comes from that source, however, or not, on every
   ground the authority of the presbyters stands higher than that of
   Papias; it takes us back unquestionably to the close of the apostolical
   period. In what way, and with what machinery, the noted men with whom
   unbelief becomes an art, and whose very efforts to propagate it are
   labored at with artistic ingenuity, will be able to set aside this
   evidence in support of John's Gospel, and, together with the testimony
   of the presbyters, that of Papias in the Latin prologue to John, is not
   apparent to me; yet I do not doubt that the skill which has defied all
   efforts to baffle it as yet, will be able to meet and overcome even
   this obstacle.

   And lastly, we have to trace the bearings of New Testament textual
   criticism on the question under discussion. This is the science which
   has to do with the primitive documents of the sacred text, the direct
   bearer of saving truth. Investigation into these primitive documents
   ought to throw light upon the history of the sacred text; i.e. we ought
   to learn from them what in all times Christendom has united in finding
   recorded in the books which contain the New Testament; this, e.g., what
   Columba, the pious and learned Irish monk of the sixth century; what
   Ambrose at Milan, and Augustine in Africa, in the fourth century; what
   Cyprian and Tertullian, in the third and second centuries, found
   recorded in their Latin copies of the New Testament: in like manner,
   what Photius, the patriarch of Constantinople, in the tenth; Cyril, the
   Bishop of Jerusalem, in the fifth; Athanasius and Origen of Alexandria,
   in the fourth and third centuries, found on record in the Greek copies
   of their time. The final and highest object of these investigations
   consists in this, however,--to trace with exactness those expressions
   and words which the holy apostles either wrote with their own hand or
   dictated to others. If the New Testament is the most important and most
   hallowed book in the world, we must certainly lay the greatest value on
   all efforts to possess the text in which it was originally written in
   its most perfect state, without omissions, without additions, and
   without changes. Should it be impossible to attain this result, still
   the task would at any rate be ours to approximate as closely as
   possible to the primitive form of the text.

   The question will at once recur to many readers, Do our ordinary
   editions of the Bible not contain the genuine and true text? The German
   Protestant, with his Luther's Bible in his hand, would ask this
   question; so would the Catholic, with his Latin Vulgate, or his German
   or French translation of it; so would the Englishman, with his
   Authorized Version; so too would the Russian, with his Sclavonic text.
   The answer to this question, viewed from what side we will, is not
   light. Every one of these translations has again its own more or less
   rich text-history, and there is no one which has not enough of the
   original to insure the degree of faith necessary to salvation. But if
   the effort be made to see how closely each follows the original, how
   truly each has preserved the text as it was given by the apostles, it
   must be compared with the original text, from which, directly or
   indirectly, all have flowed. We know that the Greek is the original
   text of the New Testament. And how is it with the genuineness of this
   text?

   When the discovery of printing, in the first quarter of the sixteenth
   century, was applied to the publication of the Greek New Testament,
   Erasmus, at Bâle, and Cardinal Ximenes, at Alcala, took as the basis of
   the work such manuscripts as were at their command. Their editions were
   repeated elsewhere, often with slight modification of the original
   text, according to other manuscripts. The learned Parisian printer,
   Robert Stephens, introduced some such modifications; the Elzevir
   followed, the work of a Leyden printer; and soon the force of usage
   became so powerful that the theologians accepted the text as it was
   established by the Erasmus, Elzevir, and Robert Etienne editions as a
   kind of authorized general edition. In the mean time, scholars had
   begun to trace new sources,--Greek manuscripts written in the first
   century, as well as manuscripts prepared for the translations effected
   in the first five centuries into Latin, Gothic, Coptic, Ethiopian,
   Armenian; to these may be added the textual readings which are found
   recorded in the works of the church Fathers of the second century. From
   this there issued at last the result that, under the hand of the
   various transcribers, learned as well as unlearned, the New Testament
   text has assumed extraordinary diversity in its readings. And, although
   this diversity is, in thousands of passages, limited to merely
   grammatical forms, having no relation to the sense, there is no lack of
   places which involve more important matters, and which are of
   historical and dogmatic value. After this had gone on so far that the
   whole of Christendom was interested in the highest degree in the
   matter, earnest men, with whom it was a sacred duty to ascertain what
   is truth rather than to conform with established usage, conceived that
   it was their especial task to reform the ordinary text by incorporating
   upon it the results of examining the ancient but later discovered
   manuscripts. Still, it is only in the most recent period that men have
   dared to lay aside the ordinary text, which had no scientific guaranty
   of authenticity, and to bring into exclusive use the text of the
   earliest documents. For it needs no proof that the oldest documents,
   those which run back to within a few centuries of the first
   composition, must be truer to the original than those which were
   written a thousand years or more subsequently to the first composition.
   In giving the preference to the most ancient documents, however, there
   is the rigid duty of examining them most carefully in respect to their
   intrinsic character and their mutual relations. With this is to be
   coupled the fact that our various most ancient manuscripts give the
   text with a great diversity of readings, through which cause their use
   is made much more difficult in establishing the original text given by
   the apostles. All the more necessary was it, therefore, to seek the
   oldest and most trustworthy of them all. In order to do this, Richard
   Bentley considered it important to give the preference to that text
   which shows the closest accordance with the oldest Greek documents and
   the Latin text of the fourth century. In accordance with Bentley's
   judgment, Carl Lachmann undertook, with very few aids, the restoration
   of the text which was generally diffused in the fourth century; for
   there seems to be no possibility of reaching any documentary evidence
   which goes back of that age. There is no doubt that the earliest Latin
   translation of the Gospels--to limit ourselves to this--was written
   soon after the middle of the second century; for, as I have had
   occasion to remark above, the Latin translator of Irenæus, before the
   close of the second century, and Tertullian in the last decade of the
   same century, appear to have been in undisputed dependence upon it.
   This oldest translation we possess [165] at the present
   time,--certainly in its main body; for our oldest documents, reaching
   back to the fifth century, and which bear relation to the text which
   was prepared in North Africa, the home of Tertullian, find a frequent
   confirmation of their readings in the two witnesses already mentioned,
   the translators of Irenæus and Tertullian. And on this account, in
   behalf of those texts which men have not recorded in their writings, it
   must be admitted that they correspond to the very earliest edition, or
   are very nearly allied to it. By the discovery of the Sinaitic
   manuscript we have advanced yet' farther; for this text, which, on
   palæographical grounds, has been assigned by competent scholars to the
   middle of the fourth century, stands in such surprising alliance with
   the oldest Latin translation that it is really to be regarded as
   coincident with the text which, soon after the middle of the second
   century, served the first Latin translator, the preserver of the
   so-called Itala, as a foundation. And that this text was not an
   isolated one is manifest from the fact that the oldest Syrian text,
   contained in a manuscript of the fifth century, lately discovered in
   the Nitrian desert, as well as Origen and others of the earliest
   Fathers, stands in specially close connection with it. The Syrian text
   just mentioned possesses on its side a power of carrying conviction
   quite analogous to the Itala, and manifesting it in that double way
   which I have endeavored to set forth; for the latest investigations
   leave no doubt that the Peshito, which is universally ascribed to the
   close of the second century, presupposes the existence of the Nitrian
   text, so that the latter must have arisen about the middle of the
   second century.

   What now follows from all these considerations in the way of answering
   the question which has been raised? Two things we have to make use of
   and apply in the most emphatic manner. At the very outset of this work
   I have indicated it as a noteworthy fact, that soon after the middle,
   and even about the middle, of the second century, the four Gospels
   underwent an undoubted common translation, and appeared in a Latin as
   well as in a Syriac version. These translations not only prove the same
   thing which the harmonistic treatment of the Gospels by Tatian of Syria
   and by Theophilus at almost the same epoch proves; they prove at the
   same time much more, namely, that as the Gospels of Luke and John were
   in existence at that time in the same form in which we have them now,
   so were those of Matthew and Mark. If isolated citations from the
   oldest epoch allow the suspicion that instead of our Matthew, the
   nearly related and only subsequently discriminated Gospel of the
   Hebrews was perhaps used, or that even our Mark had then taken that
   primitive form which is indicated in the recent investigations of
   Papias's account, yet the oldest Latin texts of these Gospels
   completely exclude this suspicion, at least so far as. the middle of
   the second century is concerned. They give thoughtful investigators as
   little ground for believing that these texts might shortly before have
   been developed by unknown hands from a previous form, and now in an
   unskillful fashion, after the change which has been wrought upon them
   by the Latin Church, are held to be the original draft. Even here the
   Nitrian text stands by the side of the Itala in confirmation of it,
   omitting, however, the Gospel of Mark, with the exception of the last
   four verses. It is well known that the discoverer and editor of this
   text uttered his conviction, and strengthened it with plausible proofs,
   that in the case of the Gospel of Matthew this text may have sprung
   from the original Hebrew form. In opposition to this decidedly
   erroneous impression, the agreement of the same Syrian text with our
   oldest Greek and Latin documents confirms in the most striking manner
   our conclusion in relation to the Greek text of Matthew, as well as the
   conclusion that in the middle of the second century there was no other
   text of Matthew than the one which we possess. And so far as Mark is
   concerned, this Syrian translator bears witness in support of the
   closing verses already employed by Irenæus, which, according to
   decisive critical authority, are not genuine, but which were appended
   to the accepted text of Mark's Gospel. [166]

   But I have yet another matter of textual criticism to take note of,
   which in my judgment affords evidence that our collective Gospels are
   to be traced back at least to the beginning of the second or the end of
   the first century. As on the one side the text of the Sinaitic
   manuscript, together with the oldest Itala text, is to be assigned
   specifically to the use of the second century, so on the other side it
   is easy to establish that that same text, in spite of all its
   superiority over other documents, had assumed even their differences in
   many respects from the primitive purity of the reading, and that it
   even then presupposed a complete text-history. We are not directed in
   this exclusively to the Codex Sinaiticus and one or another of the
   Itala manuscripts, together with Irenæus and Tertullian: but we can
   accept all these documents, which we must assign, partly from necessity
   and partly with the greatest probability, to the second century; the
   fact is undeniable that there was even then a rich text-history. We
   mean by this that even prior to the second half of the second century,
   while copy after copy of our Gospels was made, not only are there many
   errors of transcribers to be found, but the phraseology and the sense
   in particular places are changed, and larger or smaller additions are
   made from apocryphal and oral sources. With all this, such changes are
   not excluded which were the result of putting together separate
   parallel passages, and these testify in a striking manner to the early
   union of our Gospels in a single canon. If this is really the case,
   there is an important stadium of the textual history of our four
   Gospels prior to the middle of the second century, prior to the time
   when canonical authority, together with the more settled ecclesiastical
   order, made arbitrary changes in the sacred text more and more
   difficult,--this I shall take occasion to show fully at another
   time,--and for the lapse of this history we must assume at least a half
   century. According to this, must not--I dare not say the origin of the
   Gospels, but--the establishment of the evangelical canon be set at the
   close of the first century? And is not this result all the more certain
   from the coincidence with it of all the historical factors of the
   second century, which we have reviewed without any reserve?

   There will be those, it is not to be doubted, who will accuse us of
   one-sidedness and want pf thoroughness. And in truth we have passed
   over some things whose examination would have been in accordance with
   my purpose to pass in review all the oldest documents which could throw
   light upon the Gospels or illuminate their primitive recognition. If we
   have omitted anything, it is only because the inferences to be drawn
   from them touch too closely, as it has seemed to us,--perhaps
   wrongly,--upon the domain of hypothesis to give really solid results to
   our investigation. But in what we have passed over there is nothing
   which is antagonistic to what has been already advanced. We allude, e.
   g., to the earliest traces of a canonic indication and collection of
   apostolic writings, including the earliest appendices to the New
   Testament, and contained in a portion of the New Testament itself as
   the church established it in the fourth century. This is certainly the
   most recent portion, viz., the Second Epistle of Peter; where, (iii.
   16), reference is made not only to the collection of the Pauline
   Epistles, but of other New Testament writings; [167] also the closing
   verses of John's Gospel, of which verse twenty-fourth is held with the
   most correctness as the oldest testimony from the hand of a presbyter
   of Ephesus in favor of John's authorship. [168] The Testaments of the
   twelve patriarchs, [169] too, contain undeniable traces of an
   acquaintance with the books of the New Testament, the Gospels as well
   as the Pauline Epistles and the Apocalypse; they confirm, therefore,
   the existence of a collection of the books of the New Testament at the
   time when they were written, and this time can scarcely be set later
   than the close of the first or the opening of the second century. [170]
   But so far as definite details are concerned, such as can be drawn into
   active service by those who are most determined in their opposition to
   John's Gospel, we can discover nothing but misunderstanding and
   unjustified conclusions. It is a misunderstanding, for example, to
   bring the celebration in Asia Minor of the feast of the Passover into
   antagonism with the Gospel of John; for the festival as it is
   celebrated there, which builds simply upon the example of John, is
   erroneously understood as if it related to the Last Supper, while it
   really commemorates the death of Jesus the true paschal Lamb (1 Cor. v.
   7), the historic basis being given for it in John's Gospel. But when
   men bring the relation of John's to the synoptic Gospels as the ground
   for suspicion respecting the apostolic origin of the former, and cite
   the peculiarity of John's diction, as well as that of the Apocalypse,
   the universal character of his Gospel compared with Gal. ii. 9, and its
   dogmatic character, especially in relation to the person of Christ, as
   brought into contrast with the history of the Christian doctrine, they
   profess to know more than it is granted to man to know, and use what is
   naturally hypothetical and uncertain to throw doubts over what is clear
   and fixed. Against tactics which rely upon the appearance of knowledge
   and cunningly shaped hypotheses, and which are shrewdly devised to
   entrap the simple, there is need of summoning the aid of definite and
   ascertained facts.

   We can only call it a welcome occurrence that through the radical
   character of the two most distinguished modern biographers of Jesus,
   the Tubingen fantasy-builder and the Parisian caricaturist, the
   contrasts between belief and disbelief in the Gospels and the Lord have
   been made thoroughly apparent. It is only clear vision which leads to
   the gift of sure decision. Never before have theologians joined in with
   the Christian church and the whole world of culture in demanding so
   appositely as now, How is it down at the foundations, respecting our
   evangelical belief in the Lord? Nothing is easier than to deceive those
   who are not in a position which enables them to answer in a scientific
   manner this greatest question of Christendom; nothing easier than to
   mislead them under a pretense of learned and honest investigation. Yet
   the character of this age grants all license to thorough and honorable
   inquiry in matters where, in former ages less intelligent than ours,
   faith, and a faith too that often enough was blind, had unquestioned
   sway. It is just from this that many who have not been able to enter
   deeply into this class of studies have come to believe that if we look
   at the matter thoroughly and scientifically there is a great deal of
   doubt about the facts of Jesus' life. And scarcely anything has had
   more factitious influence in inducing this incredulity than the
   often-repeated statement that the ancient history of the Christian
   church gives the most conclusive testimony against the genuineness of
   our Gospels, especially that of John, in which the divine-human
   character of the Saviour of the world stands forth to the offense and
   confusion of an unchristian age more manifestly than in the synoptic
   Gospels. In the course of this investigation we have been brought to
   exactly the opposite view. To awaken doubts respecting the genuineness
   of our Gospels, and John's especially, in thy minds of the lettered as
   well as the unlettered, to cause many to deny them even, is the work
   of, that skeptical spirit which has attained to almost undisputed
   pre-eminence during the past hundred years. And yet there are few
   instances in the collective literature of antiquity of so general and
   commanding assent being given to works of a historical character as to
   our four Gospels.

   Against that kind of unbelief which has taken root in the modern
   frivolous school of religious literature, in that earth-born
   emancipation of the human spirit which will allow of no subjugation by
   the Spirit of God, science has no weapons. It is their unbelief which
   has incorporated itself into Renan's book: therein lies its power, its
   secret of success; there is no need of learned inquiry respecting it:
   the parti-colored rags which it has borrowed of science only partially
   conceal the naked limbs. It is quite otherwise with the learned
   arguments which have been brought against the life of Jesus, and the
   historic attacks which have been made upon the authenticity of the
   evangelical sources. Here we have to protest with the utmost
   decisiveness, but on the ground of rigid scientific investigation. The
   victory of God in behalf of right belongs to truth alone. It is only a
   petty littleness of belief that can believe that the sacred interests
   of truth are imperiled by the use of those dishonored weapons which are
   so much in vogue in the present age. But whoever stands in the interest
   of that truth which is to enter into victory must display his faith in
   the result by no timid counting of costs, but by the constant exercise
   of his best knowledge and most conscientious endeavors.

   [21] That this was the true date when this catalogue was proposed, is
   rendered more certain by the circumstance that the author indicates the
   episcopate of Pius, which is generally computed to have extended from
   142 to 157, by the words temporibus nostris and nuperrime, i. e. "in
   our time," and "very recently." And even when he follows his own
   conjectures, or those which were then general, respecting any matter,
   as, for example, his ascribing the "Shepherds," an apocalyptic book of
   edification, to Hermas the brother of Pius the Roman bishop, his
   chronological statements must still be conceded not to have lost any
   validity.

   [22] See Iren. adv. hæres. iii. 11: 8.

   [23] See Iren. adv. hær. iii. 3: 4; and particularly his letter to
   Florinus in Euseb. Hist. Eccl. v. 20 (Iren. opp. ed. Stieren i. 822).

   [24] In the Latin translation the passage runs: "Vidi enim te, quum
   adhuc puer (pais) essem, in inferiore Asia apud Polycarpum quum in
   imperatoria aula splendide ageres et illi (par' auto) te probare
   conareris. Nam ea quæ tunc gesta sunt melius memoria teneo, quam quæ
   nuper acciderunt (quippe quae pueri discimus, simul cum animo ipso
   coalescunt eique penitus inhærent) adeo ut et locum dicere possim in
   quo sedens beatus Polycarpus disserebat, processus quoque eius et
   ingressus vitæque modum et corporis speciem, sermones denique quos ad
   multitudinem habebat; et familiarem consuetudinem quæ illi cum Iohanne
   ac reliquis qui dominum, viderant intercessit, ut narrabat, et qualiter
   dicta eorum commemorabat: quæque de domino ex ipsis audiverat de
   miraculis illius etiam ac de doctrina, quæ ab iis qui verbum vitæ ipsi
   conspexerant acceperat Polycarpus, qualiter referebat, cuncta
   Scripturis consona." The attempt to make these closing words apply to
   the Old Testament, and not to the Gospels, is a most impotent attempt
   to take away all point whatever from what Irenæus is saying.

   [25] See adv. Marcion, iv. 2. Constituimus inprimis evangelicum
   instrumentum apostolos auctores habere, quibus hoc munus evangelii
   promuigandi ab ipso domino sit compositum; si et apostolicos, non tamen
   solos sed cum apostolis et post apostolos. Denique nobis fidem ex
   apostolis Iohannes et Matthæus insinuant, ex apostolicis Lucas et
   Marcus instaurant.

   [26] See adv. Marcion, iv. 5. In summa si constat id verius quod prius,
   id prius quod et ab initio, ab initio quod ab apostolis, pariter utique

   [27] See the document already referred to: Eadem auctoritas ecclesiarum
   ceteris quoque patrocinabitur evangeliis, quæ proinde per illas et
   secundum illas habemus, Johannis dico [before this he says, habemus et

   Petri affirmetur, cuius interpres Marcus. Nam et Lucæ digestum Paulo
   adscribere solent; capit magistrorum videri quæ discipuli promulgarint.

   [28] Theophilus was appointed bishop of Antioch, according to the
   statement of Eusebius (Hist. Eccles. iv. 19 and 20), about the eighth
   year of Marcus Aurelius's reign, i. e., about 168, at the same time
   that Soter was bishop of Rome. The third book of his able Apology to
   Autolycus he wrote, according to his own statement, in the year 181;
   the first two books in the year 180. It is extremely probable that the
   compilation from the Gospels was intended to serve in helping him
   discharge his official duties,--at the outset, at least, of his term of
   service. Tatian himself tells us (Orat. ad Græc. 19) that when in Rome
   together with Justin he shared the persecution experienced by the cynic
   philosopher Crescens. After Justin had fallen as a martyr, Tatian left
   Rome; in Syria, where he lived subsequently, he embraced the Gnostic
   heresies; at the time when Irenæus was preparing his work aimed against
   this school, i. e. about 177, Tatian does not appear to have been
   living. Comp. Iren. adv. hær. 1: 28. Tatian can not have written his
   celebrated apologetic work, Addresses to the Heathen, before his
   teacher's death (166), but he may have done so soon after. In all
   probability, however, he had prepared the Diatessaron still earlier.

   [29] See epist. 151 ad Algasiam quæst. 5. Theophilus . . . qui quatuor
   evangelistarum in unum opus dicta compingens ingenii sui nobis
   monimenta reliquit, hæc super hac parabola [the one respecting the
   Unjust Steward] in suis commentariis locutus est.

   [30] See Euseb. Histor. Eccles. iv. 29.

   [31] See Theodoret. hæret. fab. i. 20.

   [32] Jerome, in the passage already cited, as well as elsewhere (in his
   Catalogus de Viris Illustribus), alludes to Theophilus as the author of
   a commentary on the Gospel (a term applied, according to the usage of
   that time, to the four Gospels co-ordinated into a single narrative),
   and even makes use of it in explaining the parable of the Unjust
   Steward; it is very probable, therefore, that this commentary was bound
   up with the Gospels.

   [33] Hegesippus wrote a history of the church, coming down to
   Eleutheros, bishop of Rome, who is generally thought to have been in
   office from 177 to 193. Eusebius has made extensive use of this work
   (iv. 8 and 22) in preparing his own history, and gives its author great
   credit for the reliability of all his statements, and for his doctrinal
   soundness (iv. 21). In addition to the fragments which Eusebius has
   preserved, we possess another statement respecting Hegesippus, taken by
   Photius from Stephanus Gobarus, a monophysite living at the close of
   the sixth century, and incorporated in his Bibliotheca, No. 232,
   Bekker's edition, p. 288. In the fragments of Stephanus Gobarus, we
   read, in connection with the quotation, "Eye hath not seen nor ear
   heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God
   hath prepared for them that love him," that Hegesippus declared that
   this was a vain and meaningless saying, and that all such passages are
   in contradiction to the sacred scripture and to the words of the Lord,
   "Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see, and the ears
   that hear the things that ye hear." From this passage in Stephanus
   Gobarus it is not clear against whom or against what false doctrine
   Hegesippus's animadversion was directed. It is most probable that he
   aimed chiefly at a docetic error respecting the per son of Christ. As
   Paul quoted the words cited above, from 1 Cor. ii. 9, either from
   Isaiah lxiv. 3 and 4, or, as Origen supposed, from an apocryphal book
   known by the name of Elias, it became the belief of certain theologians
   that Hegesippus intended to reject the Epistles of Paul, and to condemn
   the validity of his doctrine. Nor did they hesitate to go further, and
   grant that, admitting that the passage in Corinthians was a free
   quotation from Isaiah, they should have to reject that as well. They
   even went so far as to bring Eusebius under suspicion, and to hint that
   he had willfully perverted ecclesiastical history.

   [34] The apocalyptic, ethical work, known as the "Shepherd," had
   quotations neither from the Old nor from the New Testament; there is no
   lack of references in it, however.

   [35] See, for example, chap. 35: "While we put away from us all
   injustice and wickedness, avarice, contention, cunning and deceit,
   slander and calumny, blasphemy, pride and self-seeking, ambition and
   vanity: for they who do such things are displeasing to God, and not
   alone they who do them, but they that have pleasure in them who do
   them." Comp. Rom. i. 29, et seq.

   [36] In chap. 46: "Woe to that man: it were better for him if he had
   not been born, than that he should offend one of my chosen ones: it
   were better that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were
   cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of my little ones."
   These words are cited expressly on the "saying of our Lord;" they
   disclose, however, much more clearly the very phrase taken from his
   lips and repeated in the apostle's tradition, than the use of the
   similar passages in Matt. xxvi. 24; xviii. 6; and Luke xvii. 2.

   [37] "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born
   of the Spirit is spirit. . . . The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
   thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh or
   whither it goeth. So is every one that is born of the Spirit."

   [38] "For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to
   the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."

   [39] So, for example, Niedner's History of the Christian Church, p.
   206: "The first, the greater, at the time of Antoninus Pius, in 138 or
   139; the second, the smaller, under Marcus Aurelius, soon after 161."
   The same statement is made by Neander (Gen. Hist. of the Christ. Rel.
   and Chur., 3d ed. i. 1, p. 364, et sq.): "Since in the superscription
   he does not speak of M. Aurelius as Cæsar, it is probable that it was
   written before his promotion to the imperial dignity, which took place
   in 139." Thereupon he alludes to the "greater difficulty" which the
   determination of the time when the shorter Apology was written cost
   him, and states that he could come to no decision respecting it.

   [40] The passage (i. 46) runs, "In order that it may not be said in
   senseless perversion of what I have stated respecting Christ's being
   born under Quirinus 150 years ago, his teaching what may be called his
   system under Pontius Pilate, and the inference which might be drawn
   that all men born before his time were free from guilt, I will meet
   this matter at the very outset." Every one can see in these round
   numbers, and in this mode of expression, how little the writer meant to
   assign a definite date to the composition of the Apology. Still, the
   year 147 is the one which, according to our ordinary computation, is
   assigned as the date when it was written. That in the Apology of
   Marcion the subject is alluded to as one occupying the public mind, has
   no vital relation to the time which we have specified, although to the
   statement of Irenæus that Marcion was in Rome with Cerdo at the time of
   Hyginus (generally set between 137 and 141), must be added that of the
   Arabic biographers of Mani, according to which Marcion came into notice
   in the first year of Antoninus Pius, 138: for the year 139 can not be
   coupled with this event. That Justin cites in the Apology his work
   against Marcion ("and the Marcionites" does not appear in in the
   title), is said without truth. For in i. 26 he alludes to his work
   "Against all Heresies," not to that "Against Marcion;" the latter is
   cited by Irenæus, iv. 6: 2, after a citation of the first-named work of
   Jerome in the catalogue. One circumstance opposed to this is not to be
   overlooked. If, with the pushing back of the first Apology to the year
   147, the connection of the second and the first be insisted on, and the
   latter is regarded as a mere appendix to the former, the assigning of
   so early a date to the former becomes the more improbable from the fact
   that Justin alludes in the same to the persecutions of Crescens
   following him even to his death. This seems to me to give more decisive
   evidence against the connection of the two, than the existing reference
   in the second to what is said in the first does for that connection.

   [41] If the freedom be taken to come from this date down to 150, there
   is an equal right to go back several years before 147.

   [42] By way of illustration, we may cite the passage which is given
   three times in the Dialogue (chaps. 76, 120 and 140), "They shall come
   from the east and from the west, and shall sit down in the kingdom of
   heaven with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob; but the children of the
   kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness." This coincides
   literally with Matt. viii. 11 and 12, excepting that in the latter we
   have the reading "many shall come." In like manner in the Dialogue
   (chap. 107) we have, "It is written in the Memorabilia, that your
   country folk asked him and said, 'Show us a sign.' And he answered
   them, 'An evil and an adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and
   there shall no sign be given them but the sign of the prophet Jonas."'
   This reply of the Lord coincides literally with Matt. xii. 40, with the
   mere use of "them" for "it."

   [43] Respecting Luke xxii. 44, it runs, for instance, that Justin
   alludes in the Dialogue (chap. 103) to the sweat which ran down in
   great drops while Jesus was on the mount of Olives, and, indeed, it is
   stated with express reference to the "Memorabilia composed by his
   apostles and their companions." Twice (chaps. 76 and 100) he cites as a
   saying of the Lord: "The Son of man must suffer many things, and be
   rejected by the scribes and Pharisees (chap. 100, 'by the Pharisees and
   scribes'), and be crucified, and on the third day rise again." This
   agrees more closely with Mark viii. 31 and Luke ix. 21, than with
   Matthew xvi. 21; only in Justin the reading is the "Pharisees" instead
   of the "elders and high priest" (as in Matt., Mark, and Luke), and in
   like manner "be crucified" instead of "be slain."

   [44] Among these is Theodoret's Hæret. Fab. ii. 2, according to which
   that which is said everywhere else respecting the Gospel of the Hebrews
   is asserted to have been in use among the Nazaræans. Eusebius reports
   (Hist. Eccl. vi. 12) the judgment of Serapion, bishop of Antioch,
   regarding this matter. The latter found the most of it conformable to
   the true faith, but detected here and there something superadded even
   in the sense of the Docetes, which he ascribed to the influence of that
   community in Rhossus in Cilicia, where he found the book in use.
   Origen, in his comment on Matt. xiii. 54, et sq., states that, like the
   work of James, this reports the "brethren of Jesus" to be children of
   Joseph by a former marriage.

   [45] A few examples may illustrate the character of the argument
   between Justin and the Clementine Homilies. Both Justin and the
   psuedo-Clement concur in this: "Let your yea be yea and your nay nay;
   whatever is more than this cometh of evil." In Matthew, however, it
   stands thus: "But let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay; for
   whatsoever is more than this cometh of evil." The first of these forms
   coincides, however, almost literally with that which is found in James
   v. 12, "But let [eto, Justin and the pseudo-Clement esto] your yea be
   yea, and your nay, nay." Further, we have in Justin, i. Apol. chap. 16,
   "Not all who say unto me, Lord, Lord, shall come into the kingdom of
   heaven, but they that do the will of my Father who is in heaven. For he
   who heareth me and doeth what I say, he heareth him that sent me." In
   the Homilies (8: 7) it runs, "Jesus said to one who often called him
   Lord but did none of his commandments, 'Why callest thou me Lord, Lord,
   and doest not what I say?"' Herewith compare Matt. vii. 21, " Not every
   one that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of
   heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven." In
   like manner, Luke x. 16, "He that heareth you heareth me; and he that
   despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that
   sent me." For the last clause the Cambridge Codex, with three old Latin
   manuscripts, offers the reading, "But he who heareth me, heareth him
   who sent me." Another well accredited reading of the greatest antiquity
   adds to the standard version the words, "And he that heareth me,
   heareth him that sent me." They take out, however, from Justin (and the
   Homilies) the phrase, "and doeth what I say," in order to show a
   reference to some other source. Two other examples which illustrate
   this matter will be found in the following note.

   [46] It is very doubtful whether from the way in which Justin cites
   Matt. xi. 27, and especially in view of the transposition, we are right
   in forming conclusions as to a source different from the Gospel of the
   church, in spite of the close resemblance between the Homilies and
   Justin's citation. The passage runs in Matthew, "No one knoweth
   (epiginoskei, several very ancient authorities ginoskei, but Clemens of
   Alexandria often, Origen often, Irenæus often, and Didymus, egno,
   'knew') the Son but the Father; neither knoweth (as before) any man the
   Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him" (but
   Clemens of Alex. often, Origen often, Irenæus twice, and Tertullian,
   "and to whom"--Irenæus "and to them to whom " the Son may reveal him).
   In Justin (Dial. 100, 1st Apol. 63) we have "No one knoweth (twice
   'knew') the Father save the Son, nor the Son save the Father, and those
   to whom the Son shall reveal him." In the Homilies xvii. 4, xviii. 4
   and 13, "No one knows the Father save the Son, as also no one knoweth
   the Son (oiden, xviii. 3, 'nor knoweth any one the Son) save the Father
   and they to whom the Son will reveal him.' Epiphanius has this
   transposition (in the fourth century) seven times in eleven citations,
   and twice does it occur even in Irenæus, who in a third place still has
   a reading which is peculiar to the Gnostics. We may notice the other
   details of this verse, in which very early changes of the text are
   unmistakable, without having to say, This is the canonical, this the
   heretical text. Compare in this passage my Greek Testament, eighth
   edition, first part. So in Matt. xxv. 41: "Depart (poreuesthe) from me,
   ye accursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
   angels." Justin (Dial. 76) and the pseudo-Clemens have, "Depart
   (hupagete) into outer darkness which the Father has prepared for the
   devil (pseudo-Clemens 'Satan') and his angels." Here not only has the
   Sinaitic Codex the same expression hupagete, but the Cambridge, which
   is allied to it, together with the oldest Latin witnesses, and Irenæus
   and Tertullian as well, have also, "which my Father has prepared for
   the devil and his angels." So, too, from the passage in the Homilies
   xviii. 17, "Enter through the strait and narrow way, through which you
   will pass into life," there has been an attempt to draw an inference in
   favor of an extra-canonical source; but several of the oldest witnesses
   to the text, among them the Sinaitic Codex, lead to the supposition
   that Matt. vii. 13 and 14 was read at the most remote period as
   follows: "for broad and wide is the way," "for strait and narrow is the
   way," instead of "for wide is the gate and broad is the way," "for
   strait is the gate and narrow is the way."

   [47] Throughout the whole Gospel of John this exclusively Johannean
   designation does not appear again; it is found only in the Apocalypse
   xix. 13, and as the "Word of life" at the beginning of the Epistle of
   John. Is it to be expected that Justin, if he did indeed draw from
   John, would use this term exclusively or with marked signs of
   preference?

   [48] Comp. Volkmar, Ursprung unserer Evangelien, p. 95: "Justin
   contains the root of that which is. cited in the Gospel of John, the
   beholder of the Lamb (Rev. v. 12; i. 5), or rather, Justin himself
   appears as one of the sources in favor of the later transformations of
   this latest Gospel." "Much more clearly does the most exact trial
   reveal this: that the one who tells of the Logos follows him who
   teaches regarding the Logos, the post-John follows the martyr
   substantially in all things; and it is beyond all doubt that Justin at
   least never saw this new Gospel. So far as the formula is concerned, it
   is not only wholly possible, but even probable, yes, the one thing
   probable, that the one who tells of the Logos was not only really but
   was also recorded to have been in the school of Justin, the teacher of
   the Logos."

   [49] The word peros has definitively and preferably the signification
   "blind," as the explanations in Hesychius and Suidas show; so too the
   whole passage, belonging here, Constitut. v. 7: 17, where the blind man
   of John's Gospel as well as of Justin is called ho ek genetes pepos.

   [50] In both passages Justin has the literal expression of John ix. 1,
   ek genetes, which is almost never elsewhere used in reference to
   miraculous accounts of the Gospels. Justin, too, in his Apology, puts
   it in immediate connection with the blind, after naming the lame and
   the palsied. The same seems to be true, too, of the passage in the
   Dialogue, although the expression is capable of being connected with
   the deaf and the lame.

   [51] The emphatic expression of John and Justin, ek genetes, does not
   appear here, but egennethen.

   [52] That the translation of John found a place in some of our
   manuscripts of the Septuagint, is no less than an evidence in favor of
   a primitive translation followed by Justin and John, and at variance
   with the text of the Seventy. Naturally Tertullian (de resurr. carn.
   26) as well as Theodotus (excerpt. 62) follow John's Gospel; whereas
   another passage of Tertullian (de carn. Christ. 24, also adv. Marc. 3,
   7, and adv. Iud. 14, both as far as "tribus ad tribum") attaches itself
   rather to the Apocalypse i. 7. The seventh chapter of the Epistle of
   Barnabas must also be brought into connection with the same passages of
   John.

   [53] The form retained in our translation, "be born again," which is in
   accordance with the Vulgate, is literally justified by, and is
   significantly recommended in the answer of Nicodemus. So, too, the
   explanation of the new birth made by Jesus, in the fifth verse, to
   Nicodemus, is much more closely allied with being "born again" than
   with being born "from above." Many commentators, however, ancient as
   well as modern, prefer the expression "from above." If, however, this
   reading is to be taken in the sense as if the expression of Justin did
   not conform to that of John, and therefore discloses another origin
   than John's Gospel, it is singularly thought possible to decide how
   Justin was obliged to understand John's expression. But see the next
   note.

   [54] In order to deny the connection of the Justinian quotation with
   the passage from John, it has been asserted that the expression used in
   the first, the "kingdom of heaven" (basileia ton ouranon), is not
   Johannean. But the same expression is so strongly authenticated in the
   following fifth verse, by the Sinaitic Codex, by the Docetes in
   Hippolytus, by a newly discovered fragment of Irenæus (in Harvey, p.
   498), by the apostolical constitutions, and by Origen (in the
   Interpres), that it must be regarded as in the original. (Accepted in
   1864 in my synopsis.) I must remark in addition, that the fragment of
   Irenæus has anagennethe (born again) instead of John's gennethe: it
   shows how much it lay at heart with Justin and others to give the idea
   of John's gennethe anothen (born anew) by anagennethete (born again).

   [55] For this view is claimed the similarity, also, which the quotation
   in the pseudo-Clementines, xi. 26, has with that of Justin: "for thus
   says the prophet, 'Verily I say unto you, except ye be born again with
   living water in the name of the Father, ye can not come into the
   kingdom of heaven."' The significance of this similarity is to be
   inferred from what has been expressed in the previous notes. That the
   earlier expressly denied dependence on John's Gospel is to be discerned
   in the newly discovered close of his Homilies, may be seen further on.
   Compare what is said under the head "Naasenians."

   [56] John uses the expression "kingdom of God" only in iii. 3; it is
   often met, on the contrary, in Luke, both in the Gospel and the Acts;
   often, too, in Mark, and several times in Matthew.

   [57] See Dialogue, chap. 103. In the Latin version the passage runs,
   "in commentariis quos ab eius apostolis et eorum sectatoribus scriptos
   dico."

   [58] In the same sense the passage in the fifth chapter of the Epistle
   to the Philadelphians appears to have authoritative weight: "while I
   curse myself before the Gospel, as the body of Jesus, and before the
   apostles as the elders of the church. But the prophets we will love
   because they have prophesied of the Gospel and have hoped and waited
   for the Lord." By the expression the "Gospel as the body of Jesus," in
   its connection with the apostles and prophets, is probably to be meant
   the written Gospel in the hands of the church.

   [59] See my Notitia editionis cod. Sin. cum catalogo codicum, etc., p.
   58 et sq. The MS. of the Gospels indicated under No. 2, in my
   collection of Greek MSS. dating probably from the ninth century,
   contains in three passages of Matthew the parallels of the Hebrews'
   Gospel (called to ioudaikon). At Matt. iv. 5, we have "to Jerusalem,"
   not "into the holy city." At xvi. 17 is the reading huie ioantou (son
   of John), not bariona (son of Jona). At xviii. 22, in the Hebrews'
   Gospel, after the words "seventy times seven," the addition, "for in
   the prophets, too, after that they were anointed with the Holy Ghost,
   was sin found" (literally the "word of sin," logos hamartias). This
   remarkable passage was given by Jerome in the Latin form. At xxvi. 74,
   it is asserted that instead of the words "then he began to curse and to
   swear," the Hebrews' Gospel reads, "and he denied and swore and
   cursed." Such a parallelizing of special passages as we find here would
   be irrational, yes, impossible, had the Hebrews' Gospel not the same
   character, the same tone, and in the main the same language, with that
   of Matthew. And if some of the patristic quotations from it do not seem
   to give special support to this view, it is not to be forgotten that
   these citations must be made where there are deviations from Matthew's
   reading, and that they are represented to us as such.

   [60] See adv. hær. iii. 11: 7. "Tanta est autem circa evangelia hæc
   firmitas, ut et ipsi hæretici testimonium reddant eis, et ex ipsis
   egrediens unusquisque eorum conetur suam confirmare doctrinam."

   [61] Irenæus iii. 4:.3 (and following him Eusebius iv. 11) makes him
   come to Rome at the time of Hippolytus, between 137 and 141.

   [62] See adv. hær. iii. 11: 7. Hi autem qui a Valentino sunt, eo (sc.
   evangelio) quod est secundum Johannem plenissime utentes ad ostensionem
   conjugationum suarum, ex ipso detegentur nihil recte dicentes,
   quemadmodum ostendimus in primo libro.

   [63] See adv. hær. i. 8: 5. Adhuc autem Johannem discipulum domini

   [64] See Philosophum. vi. 35. Literally the passage runs: Therefore all
   the prophets, and the law spoken of as Demiurgos, a foolish god, sunk
   in folly and ignorance (elalesan apo tou demiourgou . . . moroi ouden
   eidotes). On this account, according to Valentine, the Saviour says,
   "All that before me," etc.

   [65] Appeal is made especially to i. 8: 1-4, and 8: 5; yet in the
   former of these only the three first Gospels are referred to, in the
   latter only the last; moreover, they are alluded to only by Ptolemy,
   whose name is given in the Latin text ("Et Ptolemæus quidem ita;" in
   the Greek text these words are lacking) at the end of the account. At
   8: 1-4, however, Irenæus refers to the Valentinians, not to Valentine.
   Can it be said, however, that 1-4 is the master with his pupils, and
   that in the fifth section only the pupil is meant?

   [66] Compare, with reference to this, the Preface.

   [67] "Si autem non prolatum est sed a se generatum est, et simile est
   et fraternum et eiusdem honoris id quod est vacuum ei patri, qui
   prædictus est a Valentino; antiquius autem et multo ante exsistens et
   honorificentius reliquis æonibus ipsius Ptolemæi et Heracleonis, et
   reliquis omnibus qui eadem opinantur."

   [71] But is the real meaning of Kerdon diadechetai Herakleona, Cerdo
   follows Herakleon? Is it not rather, Cerdo follows in my work on
   Herakleon? If any one should happen to be pleased with this burlesque
   style of exposition, he will scarcely be able to persuade others of its
   excellence. Another discovery on the same side deserves equal credit.
   Hippolytus alludes to a contention between the two wings of the
   Valentinian school in these words: "The adherents of the Italiotic
   faction, to which Herakleon and Ptolemy belong, say thus; the adherents
   of the oriental faction, to which Axionikus and Bardesanes belong,
   thus." "Over this," he goes on to say, "they, and any body else who
   likes to, may quarrel." From this the inference is to be drawn not only
   that this "they" relates specifically to the above-mentioned heads of
   factions, but the word zeteitosan, "may quarrel," indicates that these
   persons were still living and contending at the time of Hippolytus. Who
   could doubt after applying this test that Marcion and Tertullian were
   contemporaries, since the latter writes, de carne Chr.: "On such
   grounds hast thou probably ventured to put out of the way so many
   original writings respecting Christ, Marcion, in order to disprove his
   existence in the flesh. On what authority hast thou done this? I ask.
   If thou art a prophet, then prophesy; if an apostle, preach openly; if
   a follower of the apostles, hold fast to them; and if thou art a
   Christian, believe what is transmitted to us. But if thou art none of
   these, I might rightly say, then die, for thou art already dead; for
   thou canst not be a Christian if thou hast not the faith which makes
   one such."

   [72] See Euseb. Hist. Eccl. iv. 7: phesin (Agrippa Castor) auton eis
   men to euangelion tessara pros tois eikosi suntaxai biblia. Even if
   nothing. more definite is to be determined respecting the book of
   Basilides, it is a fact of weight that Agrippa Castor had already made
   use of the same expression, from which we learn with certainty that
   some centuries later he indicated the collective character of our
   Gospels.

   [73] When the apostles were asking whether it is better not to marry,
   the story is that the Lord answered: "Not all can understand this, for
   there are eunuchs who are so from their birth, others are compelled to
   be so, and others still have made themselves eunuchs for the
   everlasting kingdom's sake." The last words are supplemented by what is
   found in Clemens. In like manner the same expression is cited by the
   Nikolaites in Epiphanius 25:6. Another extract found in Clemens "from
   the 23d book of the Exegetica of Basilides," contains no passage to be
   compared with this, nor does that in the Archelaus-disputation.

   [74] On this account he says, "Do not throw your pearls before swine,
   nor give that which is holy to the dogs."

   [75] That Jerome (in the pref. to Matt. and likewise in his translation
   of the first Homily of Origen on Luke, according to Jerome, also,
   Ambrosius on Luke) mentions an original Gospel of Basilides, probably
   rests only upon the acceptance of the 24 books of the Gospel as of a
   Gospel in a certain sense apocryphal; we must therefore consider the
   secret communications of Matthew, which according to Hippolytus were
   extolled by Basilides and his followers, as that Gospel of Basilides.
   See vii. 25. "As it is written, 'And the creation itself groaneth and
   travaileth together, waiting for the manifestation of the children of
   God."' (Rom. viii. 22 and 19.) "That is the . . . wisdom of which he
   says the Scripture asserts, 'Not with words which human wisdom
   teacheth, but which the Spirit teacheth."' 1 Cor. ii. 13. Reference is
   made to the same in Eph. iii. 3 and 5, and 2 Cor. xii. 4.

   [76] See vii. 26. "That is it, he says, which is written: 'The Holy
   Ghost shall come upon thee, . . . and the power of the Highest shall
   overshadow thee."' The allusion to Matthew is in vii. 22, and relates
   to the account of the star seen by the wise men.

   [77] See vii. 20. "Basilides, therefore, and Isodorus, Basilides' own
   son and disciple, assert that Matthias transmitted to them certain
   secret communications which he had received from the Saviour as a
   special charge. We shall see how openly Basilides as well as Isodorus
   and their whole crowd of followers calumniate not only Matthias but the
   Saviour also." This is at the commencement of his representation of
   Basilides, and his school. And just so often as he has occasion, in
   what follows, to mention Basilides, he is to be understood as alluded
   to in the same strain as at the outset.

   [78] See Theodoret. Quæst. xlix. in libr. iv. Regum: "On this account I
   believe that the Ophites are called Naassenians." The only mention of
   the Ophites in Hippolytus is viii. 20: Ei de kai eterai tines haireseis
   onomazontai Kainon, Ophiton e Noachaiton (Noachiton?) kai heteron
   toiouton ouk anankaion hegemai ta hup' auton legomena e ginomena
   ekthesthai, etc. From this there can scarcely any inference be drawn,
   except that to Hippolytus the name of Ophites seemed quite secondary
   compared with that of Naassenians.

   [79] The same division of the sentence is followed by many of our
   oldest textual documents, namely, the oldest patristic extracts.

   [80] We do not add to the above all the peculiar Gnostic explanations
   appended to the passages in the original.

   [81] In connection with these extracts we must call particular
   attention to the fact that they quite often unite a free transposition
   of the text with a strictly close repetition of the words. They reveal
   in this a striking similarity to the citations of Justin. The same kind
   of quotations from Matthew and the other synoptic Gospels compel us to
   draw an immediate inference as to an extra-canonical source. Does not
   the analogy with these Gnostic and almost contemporaneous extracts from
   John show how little such a hasty conclusion as to the Justinian
   citation is justified? Or are we, in the case of the quotation given
   above from John vi. 53, to draw a conclusion as to that extra-canonical
   source, because, in entire analogy with Justin's quotation from John
   vi. 51, the concluding words, "ye shall not enter the kingdom of
   heaven," are given instead of John's "you have no life in you"?

   [82] With reference to this, see a previous note. Tertullian adv.
   Marcion, i. 19, writes: Cum igitur sub Antonino primus Marcion hunc
   deum induxerit. . . . The determination of dates in Marcion's works is
   a matter presenting the gravest difficulties. Although the "invaluit
   sub Aniceto" of Irenæus iii. 4: 3 is not to be applied to his
   appearance at Rome, yet there is a contradiction still remaining
   involving a statement of Clemens (Strom. vii. 17), who places Marcion
   before Basilides and Valentine. As the latter position appears to be
   sustained by the recent striking discovery of a memorandum of
   Philastrius (hær. 45, qui, i. e. Marcion, devictus atque fugatus a
   beato Johanne evangelista), . . . so the same appears to be
   corroborated by the recent exhuming of the unquestionably ante-Jerome
   prologue to John, of which I shall have occasion to speak when I come
   to the Papias problem. Manifestly we have to deal with a primitive
   tradition running hack to a time antedating Marcion's earliest activity
   and his removal to Rome.

   [83] See Iren. iii. 2 and 12, where the assertion is made by the
   heresiarchs with specific reference to Marcion: Dicentes se . . .
   sinceram invenisse veritatem. Apostolos enim admiscuisse ea quæ sunt
   legalia Salvatoris verbis. (iii. 2: 2.) Et apostolos quidem adhuc quæ
   sunt Judæorum sentientes annuntiasse evangelium, se autem sinceriores
   et prudentiores apostolis esse. Unde et Marcion et qui ab eo sunt ad
   intercidendas conversi sunt scripturas, quasdam quidem in totum non
   cognoscentes, secundum Lucam autem evangelium et epistolas Pauli
   decurtantes, hæc sola legitima esse dicant quæ ipsi minoraveruint.
   (iii. 12: 12.) Similar words in Tert. adv. Marc. iv. 3. Sed enim
   Marcion nactus epistolam Pauli ad Galatas, etiam ipsos apostolos
   suggilantis ut non recto pede incedentes ad veritatem evangelii, simul
   et accusantis pseudapostolos quosdam pervertentes evangelium Christi,
   connititur ad destruendum statum eorum evangeliorum, quæ propria et sub
   apostolorum nomine edantur vel etiam apostolicorum, ut scilicet fidem
   quam illis adimit suo conferat.

   [84] See Iren. iii. 1:1 (also Euseb. Hist. Eccl. v. 8): Et Lucas autem,
   sectator Pauli, quod ab illo prædicabatur evangelium in libro condidit.
   Tert. adv. Marc. iv. 5. Nam et Lucæ digestum Paulo adscribere solent.
   In like manner Orig. in Euseb. Hist. Eccl. vi. 25; Eus. iii. 4 and
   Hier. de viris illustrib. cap. 7: in all these three passages the
   assertion is distinctly made that it was then understood that Paul
   indicated Luke's Gospel when he spoke of his Gospel. Rom. ii. 16. Here
   belongs also Ps.-Orig. Dial. contr. Marcionit., sect. i. (Or. opp. ed.
   Delarue, vol. i. p. 808), where, to the question of the Orthodox man
   who asks, "Who wrote the Gospel of which thou sayest that it is the
   only one?" the Marcionite replies, "Christ," and to the second
   question, "Did the Lord himself write 'I was crucified and rose again
   on the third day'?" the answer is, "That was added by the apostle
   Paul."

   [85] See A. Ritschl (Prof. at Gottingen) in the Jahrb. f. deutsch.
   Theol. 1866, 2. p. 355: so is he (i. e. Prof. Tischendorf) unable
   naturally to convince himself that in a remote province like Pontus
   there could not be without a degree of personal fault a more limited
   acquaintance with Christian books than in other provinces of the
   church.

   [86] Had the Gospel of John appeared in Gottingen or in some other
   celebrated University-city of Germany, I should have been more able to
   take this charge home to myself.

   his heretical opponents, and whoever has followed the course of his
   onslaught upon Marcion must know how much he had to draw from
   Tertullian's expression, in order to establish the historical fact
   which he wanted to make good. If Marcion complained of the depravatio
   evangelii and gave himself out as the emendator evangelii, he meant by
   evangelium the regula fidei, Christianity as a common belief; which he
   wanted to purify from the Judaic additions made by the anti-Pauline
   school. And since Marcion. did not defend the Gospel canon which was
   known to Tertullian, the latter drew the inference that he was opposing
   the value of this collection on the ground of being a reformer of it.

   [97] Otherwise the Montanists and their most decided followers must
   have met in their rejection of the Gospel of John. There is not only no
   support for this view, involving as it does the grossest
   contradictions, but it contradicts as well what Hippolytus, Tertullian,
   and Eusebius have recorded respecting the connection of the Paraclete
   with the Montanist prophetic spirit. And had the Montanists thrown away
   the Gospel of John at the outset, how would it be clear that in
   Tertullian, the reformer of Montanism, we find (without the least trace
   of a contrast to the earlier Montanism) the Gospel of John standing in
   the closest connection with Montanism? Besides, all which is expressed
   in the passage of Irenæus applies just as appositely to the opponents
   of Montanism, as it is inapposite and incomprehensible when it is made
   to refer to the Montanists.

   [98] Neander (Hist. of the Christian Church, 1856, 3d ed.) remarks in
   allusion to the Irenæus passage, which he understands just as I do:
   "Irenæus, from whom we receive our first knowledge respecting this
   party [the Alogians], assuredly says too much when he states that they
   rejected the Gospel of John in consequence of the passage relating to
   the Paraclete. That passage alone certainly could not have led to this,
   for they only made use of it, as was the case with others, to limit it
   to the apostles, in order to take away the support from beneath the
   Montanists. But since they, if those words of Christ were brought
   against them with a Montanist interpretation, stigmatized the whole
   document which contained them as not genuine, the inference was a quick
   one that, in consequence of a kind of legerdemain only too common in
   theological discussion, they had in consequence of this passage
   rejected the whole Gospel."

   [100] Irenæus states (iii. 3: 4) that the story was repeated after
   Polycarp that John once encountered Cerinth while bathing, but
   instantly left the bath with these words, "Let us get out; the bath
   might come to pieces with such an enemy to truth in it as Cerinth is."
   That two hundred years later Epiphanius attributed this anecdote to
   "Ebion" has no weight when set over against the authority of Irenæus.
   For the statement of Epiphanius (hær. 28: 2) that Cerinth once had
   communication with Peter, and that he was one of those who criticised
   his relations with the Gentile centurion Cornelius, there is no earlier
   voucher.

   [101] According to 2: 27, Celsus suffers his Jews to be told that
   Christians changed and corrupted the "Gospel" for polemic ends.

   [102] Mary, poor, living by the work of her own hands, is said to have
   been driven away by her husband, a carpenter, in consequence of an
   adulterous connection with a soldier named Panthera; and the story is
   that Jesus hired himself in Egypt in consequence of his poverty, and
   learned secret arts there.

   [103] See Origen 2: 13, where the Jew of Celsus says, "I might bring
   forward many things which were written of Jesus, and which are strictly
   true, though differing from the writings of the disciples; yet I will
   leave this on one side."

   [107] That there is an allusion to the Marcionites does not do violence
   to this determination of the date; still, mention is made of the heresy
   of Marcion as early as the first Apology of Justin.

   [108] In 1851 appeared in the Hague a prize essay written by me in
   1849: De evangelior. apocryph. origine et usu. I hope to publish a
   revised edition of it for the use of learned readers.

   [109] Those who care to go further into this matter I must beg to see
   in the original Greek how the passage runs in Justin, in Luke (i. 30 et
   sq.), and in the Protevangel (see my elaborately annotated Evang.
   Apocr. 1853, p. 21 et sq. Protevang. chap. xi.).

   [110] Justin has it: The Spirit of the Lord shall come upon thee and
   the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore that which
   shall be born of thee is holy, the Son of God. Luke says: The Holy
   Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
   overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of
   thee shall be called the Son of God. The pseudo-James has it thus: For
   the power of the Lord shall overshadow thee; therefore shall the holy
   thing which is born of thee be called the Son of the Highest.

   [111] In Justin it runs: Pistin de kai charan labousa . . . apekrinato.
   In the pseudo-James: Charan de labousa Mariam apiei pros Elisabet.

   [112] See Hilgenfeld: Kritische Untersuchungen über die Evangelien
   Justins, p. 159 et sq.

   [113] See Epiph. hæres. xxvi. 12.

   [114] Would one accept a closer relation between the Protevangelium and
   the Gnostic book of Mary, there would be a certain probability in
   giving the heretical Gnostic production such a dependence upon the
   half-Catholic book of James as is manifested in the many instances of
   extra-ecclesiastical literature depending upon that of the church. The
   hints given by Augustine in the twenty-third book against Faustus would
   also have weight in this regard, while those too of the Gnostic work
   called De generatione Mariæ have similar value. Mary was represented in
   this as a daughter of a priest Joachim of the tribe of Levi.

   [115] See Orig. opp. ed. Delarue, iii. 463 (comm. in Matt. tom. x. 17).

   [116] For a full characterization of this matter, the passage from
   Hilgenfeld may have so much appositeness as to admit of its being
   quoted. "It is certainly true that the present form of the Protevangel,
   while alluding to John and his parents without describing his birth
   more closely, is incomplete, and indicates more than it tells; but
   since the Gnostics in their Genna Marias gave an account of the
   dumbness which came upon Zacharias, the suspicion is not risked that
   the primitive draft of the Gospel contained an account of those
   antecedent events. The suspicion may not be ventured; it is entirely
   without support. For the story of Zacharias's dumbness stands in the
   Gnostic production completely isolated; it has not the slightest
   analogy either with Luke or with the Protevangel. If the latter points
   to something beyond itself, it is at any rate clear that our canonical
   Gospels, including that of Luke, stand in the background. On the other
   hand, there is a close connection established with the Gnostic
   primitive form of the Protogospel: "the same is manifestly received
   only in a revision, worked over after the canonical Gospels mainly,
   causing it thereby to lose, as it would seem, many of its
   peculiarities." But may not then the Book of James have a like close
   connection with the canonical Gospels, taking into account the
   agreement with them of its whole nature and purport? Further on, we
   read: "The admission that Justin made use of such an ancient
   Protevangel may be allowed if it be held as probable that such a
   production, bearing among the Gnostics the title Genna Marias,
   contained a genealogy of Mary." After further remarks there follows:
   "All the more attractive therefore is another trace to which Origen
   leads us. In the passage where he alludes to the Gospel of Peter and
   the Protogospel of James, he speaks of them both as bearing the same
   testimony. But how would this be if both Gospels should prove to be
   closely related? How if in the Protogospel of James the preliminary
   history of Peter's Gospel--for there can scarcely be a doubt that there
   was such a preliminary history--were accepted? Is not this more than
   building on the sand?"

   [117] The first reference to Justin appears, as Hilgenfeld was the
   first to remark, in the document addressed to the congregations at
   Lyons and Vienna about the year 177. Allusion is made there (Eus. Hist.
   Eccl. v. 1: 3, et sq.) to the martyrdom of Zacharias. Tertullian in the
   Scorpiacum contr. Gnosticos, chap. 8, refers to the same thing, only
   with more definite and positive language. Clemens Alexandr. alludes to
   the circumstances connected with the midwives. Strom. vii. page 889 in
   Potter. Origen is the first who mentions the work as the book of James.

   [118] We pass over the story of the death of Zacharias in the
   Protevangel to Matt. xxiii. 36. If this can be so understood as if
   affording an historical basis for the passage in Matthew, it would
   strengthen the proof of the antiquity of the Gospels which we derive
   from the document of James.

   [119] A third reference must be accepted in the thirty-eighth chapter,
   where he in like manner cites Is. lxv. 2, and 1. 6: "I gave my back to
   the smiters and exposed my cheeks to blows:" see also the words already
   cited of the xxii. Psalm, "They cast lots," etc., in conjunction with
   Psalm iii. 5, "I laid me down and slept; I awaked," etc., and Ps. xxii.
   8. He makes this close to the prophecies: "and this was all done by the
   Jews to Christ, as you can learn" (here we have this express
   declaration) "from the Acts compiled under Pontius Pilate."

   [120] Instead of akta we have the specific word hupomnemata. The same
   title, prepared too for the official report of Pilate, appears in the
   Præsidial Acts relative to the martyrs Tarachus, Probus and Andronikus.
   See my Evv. apocr. p. lxii. In the same sense it is used in a homily
   inscribed to Chrysostom (Chrys. opp. tom. v. p. 942) and in the
   Martyrium Ignatii, chap. iii. But with this we must reconcile the
   expression hupomnematikai ephemerides, which Philo uses (de legat. ad
   Cajum 25) in reference to the reports which were sent by Alexander to
   the emperor of Rome. The oldest Latin title, found in Gregory of Tours,
   is the Gesta Pilati.

   [121] The thirty-eight years and the healing on the Sabbath are taken
   from John's narrative, v. 2; that about the man who was carried by,
   from Matthew ix.

   [122] &gt;See Weitzel: Die christliche Passahfeier der drei ersten
   Jahrhunderte, p. 248 et sq.

   [123] &gt;On scientific grounds it is not to be excused if one in
   learned investigations follows in the old rut and speaks of the Gospel
   of Nicodemus. Compare my re-establishing of the old title and the
   investigation respecting it in the Prolegomenon of the Evangelia
   apocrypha, p. liv. et sq. It corresponds best with what was said above
   respecting the use of the word hupomnemata, if we say the "Acts of
   Pilate." The Latin designation, Gesta Pilati, also answers well to
   this.

   [124] &gt;See Euseb. Hist. Eccl. ix. 5 and 7.

   [125] Comp. with reference to this my paper: Pilati circa Christum
   indicio quid lucis afferatur ex actis Pilati. Lipsiæ, 1855.

   [126] Of later writers Epiphanius admits (hæres. L. Quartodec. i.) that
   appeal was made to the Acts of Pilate in order to establish the time of
   Jesus' death, it being given there as the twenty-fifth of March. He
   adds, however, that he had found copies where the eighteenth was
   assigned as the date. The first date is found also in our texts.

   [127] See the two anaphorai Pilatou in our Evv. apocr. pp. 413-425.

   [128] It will gratify the wish of the reader if I insert here a portion
   of the text of the work itself. We select for this purpose the whole of
   the third chapter, tinged as it is with the coloring of John: "And full
   of rage Pilate came forth from the hall of judgment (the Prætorium) and
   said to them, 'I take the sun to witness that I find no fault in this
   man.' But the Jews answered and said to the governor, 'If this man had
   not been a malefactor, we should not have delivered him over to you.'
   Pilate answered, 'Take him away and judge him after your law.' The Jews
   answered, 'It is not permitted to us to put ally one to death.' Pilate
   said, 'Did God order you not to put any one to death and not me as
   well?' Pilate went again into the judgment hall and called Jesus to him
   privately, and asked him, 'Art thou the king of the Jews?' Jesus
   answered him, 'Speakest thou that of thyself, or have others told it
   thee?' Pilate answered Jesus, 'Am I a Jew? Thy people and the high
   priest have delivered thee over to me: what hast thou done?' Jesus
   answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world; for if my kingdom were of
   this world, then would my servants have fought that I should not be
   delivered over to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not thence.' Then
   spoke Pilate unto unto him, 'Thou art a king, then.' Jesus answered
   him, 'Thou sayest that I am a king. For this cause was I born and am
   come into the world, that every one who is out of the truth may hear my
   voice.' Pilate asked, 'What is truth?' Jesus answered, 'The truth is
   from heaven.' Pilate asked again, 'Is there no truth on the earth?'
   Jesus answered, 'Thou seest how those who speak the truth are brought
   to judgment of those who have power on the earth."' At the close of the
   fourth chapter we have: "But when Pilate saw the throng of Jews around
   him he perceived that many of the Jews were weeping, and said, 'Not all
   the people wish him to die.' Then answered the elders, 'We, the whole
   people, have come, that he might be sentenced to death.' Pilate answers
   them, 'Wherefore should he die?' The Jews reply,' Because he said he
   was God's son and a king.'"

   [129] Compare respecting this my Evangelia Apocrypha in the Prolegg. i.
   p. xxxix. et sq.

   [130] See the same work.

   [131] Comp. Hilgenfeld: Kritische Untersuchungen über die Evv. Justins,
   der Clementinischen Homilien und Marcions, 1850 (therefore before
   1853), p. 387 et sq. Here an effort is ascribed to the fourth
   Evangelist to subordinate Peter to the beloved disciple, and on this
   account the fourth Evangelist's independence of Peter's Gospel is
   admitted, but afterwards every proof favoring the use of the Gospel of
   John is denied to the connection of the homilies with him. (Page 346
   had thus decided with respect to the expression, Horn. 3: 52, "My sheep
   hear my voice": "It is a question whether the Gospel of John or one
   still older contained this passage.") "Against such a use," it goes on
   literally to say, "stands the glaring difference in the tendency of
   both writers, so that in presupposing an acquaintance with this Gospel
   one must admit a polemic objective view. Let one imagine an attack made
   upon the divinity of Christ, and satisfy himself how such an author
   could dispose of John i. 1; x. 33, et sq.; xx. 28. While, in John x.
   36, Jesus declares himself substantially as the Son of God, so that his
   own assertion is an expression of his divinity, the author of the
   Homilies takes the same expression, 16:15, to be a decisive statement
   of the difference between Jesus and the Deity. The Lord never declared
   himself to be God, but the Son of God. How was it possible, after using
   the fourth Gospel, to expressly limit the time of the intercourse of
   Jesus and the disciples to a single year, and not, as later teachers
   have accepted, the time of his public career? How could he besides,
   while declaring Peter to be the first fruits and cherished disciple of
   Christ, so markedly leave out the Johannean portraiture, and among the
   expressions used by Jesus regarding the devil (xix. 2), which he
   doubtless collects as completely as was possible, how could he omit
   such an expression as John viii. 44? The result of our investigation is
   in a word this, that even in Clementine's Homilies the Gospel of Peter,
   in contradistinction to Justin and some farther continuations, is used;
   with him Matthew, perhaps Luke also, but certainly not the Gospel of
   John."

   [132] With the utmost probability Celsus made use (about 150) of the
   epistle of Barnabas. That he specifically speaks of the apostles as
   ponerotatoi, Origen infers (contr. Cels. i. 63) from the use of the
   epistle.

   [133] The text however is not to be judged from what is published, nor
   is that of Dr. Hilgenfeld, who has contented himself with
   unscientifically repeating it just as it was left in the edition of two
   hundred years ago.

   [134] See Beiträge i. a. 1.: "These words do not suit if they be made
   with Orelli (Selecta pp. eccl. capita, etc.) to refer to the apocryphal
   fourth book of Ezra which Barnabas elsewhere cites." One would draw the
   inference from this which Volkmar insists should be deduced from
   Credner's words, quite in antagonism to what Credner himself asserts.

   [135] See Volkmar: Index lectt. in liter. univ. Turic. 1864, page 16.
   Scriptum est apud Esdram Prophetam iv. Esd. viii. 3: "multi creati,
   pauci autem salvati." Hoc auctor confudit cum dicto Christi apud Matth.

   mea Esdræ Prophetæ, 1863, p. 290, post J. C. de Orelli et C. A.

   note, agree with this?) quorum meritum plerisque in memoriam revocandum
   erat, demonstravit, omnibus qui hucusque de ea re ex ed. nea
   iudicarunt, persuasit. . . .

   [136] See D. F. Strauss, Das Leben Jesu, p. 55.

   [137] Volkmar (Der Ursprung unserer Evv. p. 161) assigns the date of
   this work to "97, harvest time."

   [138] The statement given above of the heathen scoffer Celsus merits
   unquestionable pre-eminence over this discovery; for according to him
   the expression, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
   needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God," is but
   another form of Plato's "It is impossible that he who is
   extraordinarily rich should be extraordinarily good." See Origen contr.
   Cels. 6: 16. As for other matters, however, the crafty trickery of
   Volkmar does not derive any reflected credit from Renan, as it was said
   to do in the earlier editions of this work; it should have the claim
   allowed it of having anticipated Renan, since the latter work appeared
   in 1863, whereas Volkmar's preface to "Esdra Propheta" is dated
   October, 1862. Honor to whom honor is due.

   [139] So Volkmar i. a. 1. p. 161. "118-119 Alexandrine epistle named
   after Barnabas, with a knowledge of the Gospel of Matt. as a new work
   with the most ample use of Matthew, but with the sayings of Christ
   taken only from the hallowed Old Testament."

   [140] A later affix with Matt. than with Barnabas is "to repentance."

   [141] By this I seek to render literally epei oun mellousin legein.

   [142] Not less than in Barnabas does it become clear in Justin that he
   makes the brazen serpent of John's Gospel the type of the cross. Even
   Justin's expression, Dial. 91, appeared to have flowed from a
   recollection of John: Prospheugousi to ton estauromenon huion autou
   pempsanti eis ton kosmon, for John iii. 17, ou gar apesteilen ho theos
   ton huion autou eis ton kosmon, is closely connected with iii. 14.
   Naturally, with Barnabas there is the same process of divination
   applied that we find earlier among the Clementines. So Volkmar i. a. 1.
   p. 67: The author "seems not to depend at all upon the Sap. Sal. 16: 5,
   which had already prefigured the typical character of the serpent. But
   least of all upon the Logos Gospel (John iii. 14), for his special
   comparison of the lifting up of the serpent in the wilderness with the
   lifting up of Christ (on the cross and thus to the heaven) is wanting
   here: and how could one who in this connection read 'in order that
   every one who should, believe in him should not perish, but have
   everlasting life' discard such a saying as the above? No one of us (!)
   could do it." In the same fashion Volkmar shows in his Append. to
   Credner's Gesch. des Neutest. Kanons (1860, p. 372) that Tertullian had
   not been acquainted with the first Epistle of Peter, or, if he could
   not deny to Tertullian acquaintance with the work Adv. Gnosticos,
   asserts that it was only subsequently to 207 that he was familiar with
   it. He writes, "What apt proofs it (the epistle) offers to the opponent
   of the Gnosis de resurr. carn. . . . the Montanist moralist even, de
   pudicit . . . or de habitu mulier. . . . How was he able to pass over
   Peter in the letter, when going through the entire list of prophets and
   apostles? An Epistola Petri has no place in his Instrumentum
   Apostolorum, as he draws it up in both its chief forms." Pity that that
   whole course of acute reasoning finds its answer in the fact (as Dr.
   Aberle has already shown in the Theol. Quartalschrift, 1864, 1) that
   its first propounder has overlooked. Tertullian's complete work, De
   oratione, where (Semler, p. 15, chap. xiv.) express reference is made
   to the "præscriptio Petri," in 1 Pet. iii.

   [143] Irenæus says (hær. iii. 3: 4 and ii. 22: 5) that he lived in
   Trajan's day, 98 to 117. Eusebius (in the Chronicon) sets his death at
   the year 100, and Jerome (de viris illustrib. and elsewhere) 68 years
   after the death of Christ. The Chronic. Pasch. has 72 years after the
   ascension of Christ.

   [144] The change of arrangement in several of our oldest Itala
   manuscripts (Matthew, John, Luke, Mark) does not rest on a
   chronological basis, but, according to Tertullian, upon the connection,
   first of the two men who were apostles, then of those who were helpers
   of the apostles.

   [145] This is in accord with the statement of Eusebius iii. 37: 2, that
   already at Trajan's time (98 to 117) a part of the missionary activity
   inspired by Christianity consisted in the diffusion of the written
   gospel narratives (kai ten ton theion euangelion paradidonai graphen).

   [146] Logion kuriakon exegesis. Rufin, following the ancient usage,
   translates logia by oracula. It is extremely probable that the book of
   Papias, true to the chiliastic standpoint of the man, was largely
   devoted to the prophecies of the Lord. Christian usage, however, gave
   the word a larger significance, so that the sayings of the Lord and of
   the apostles, although not having the precise character of prophecy,
   are yet called by that name, and the Holy Writ was designated as theia
   logia. Papias makes use of the same expression in conveying a notion of
   the contents of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, where the narrower
   conception conveyed in the word "prophecy" does not do justice to the
   meaning.

   [147] Tas para tou kuriou te pistei dedomenas kai ap' autes
   paraginomenas tes aletheias.

   [148] Tous ton presbuteron anekrinon logous, ti Andreas e ti Petros

   [150] To understand who these presbyters were, it is not necessary to
   understand that they were personally connected with the immediate
   companions of the apostles, as Irenæus (iv. 27: 1) shows: Quemadmodum
   audivi a quodam presbytero (later it runs: inquit ille senior) qui
   audierat ab his qui apostolos viderant et ab his qui didicerant. But
   Irenæus (v. 36: 2) refers to the "presbyters " without any additional
   designation.

   [151] As witness to his existence, Dionysius of Alexandria (232,
   superintendent of the Alexandrine School of Catechumens) quotes in
   Euseb. vii. 25: 6 the mere fact that there were two monuments at
   Ephesus inscribed with the name of John, and Eusebius busies himself
   (iii. 29) more closely with attempting to give more weight to the
   testimony of Papias to the existence of the second John; in support of
   which he brings forward, evidently following the lead of Dionysius, the
   existence of the two Johannean monuments at Ephesus.

   [152] In the last passage we have ta logia without any further
   designation; he refers however to what goes before, where we haveton
   kuriakon logion.

   [153] Eusebius speaks of Papias even at the time of Trajan.

   [154] The memorandum in a Latin Oxford codex of the fourteenth century,
   respecting the four Marys, on whose margin is written the word Papias,
   is unquestionably to be referred to a Papias of the middle ages, if
   there is any meaning to be ascribed to marginal words. In such
   excerpts, particularly as they are given in the Catenas and similar
   works, the addition of the author's name is a matter of the greatest
   untrustworthiness.

   [155] So e. g. Zeller: "The silence of Papias will always afford
   conclusive evidence against the authenticity of the Gospel of John."
   Theol. Jahrb. 1847, p. 199. Hilgenfeld: "Had Papias said the least
   thing respecting a Gospel of John, Eusebius could not possibly have
   overlooked it, and as he examined into the works transmitted by John,
   he could not have kept silence had there existed a written Gospel from
   his hand. Die Evangelien, p. 344. Strauss: "The silence of Papias
   respecting John as the author of this Gospel is the more weighty in
   that he not only expressly assures us that he has carefully looked into
   what was left behind by John, but that, as the bishop of Asia Minor and
   an acquaintance of Polycarp, the disciple of John, he would
   consequently know something more definitely respecting the apostle, who
   spent his later years in Ephesus." Leben Jesu, p. 62. Renan: "Papias,
   qui avait recueilli avec passion les récits oraux de cet Aristion et de
   ce Presbyteros Joannes, ne dit pas un mot d'une Vie de Jésus écrite par
   Jean. Si une telle mention se fût trouvée dans son ouvrage, Eusèbe, qui
   relève chez lui tout ce qui sert à l'histoire littéraire du siècle
   apostolique, en eût sans aucun doute fait la remarque." Vie de Jesus,
   3d éd. 1863, p. xxiv. Volkmar: "We may therefore certainly presuppose
   that had Eusebius found a trace of the use of the anti-chiliastic
   Gospel of Papias he would all the more eagerly have brought it out;"
   and this opinion is preceded by the remark that "Papias edited his
   collection and interpretation of the Lord's prophecies about the year
   167 of our era." Ursprung uns. Evv. p. 59.

   [156] Hopoiais kechrentai ton antilegomenon, tina te peri ton
   endiathekon kai homologoumenon graphon kai hosa peri ton me toiouton
   autois eiretai.

   [157] That 1 John and 1 Peter can not be taken out of this category
   Eusebius himself declares, vi. 14, when he speaks of Clement. (See text
   immediately following.) From the representation of Cosmas
   Indicopleustes in the seventh book of his Topographia Christiana we
   learn in like manner that the authenticity of all the catholic epistles
   was contended against.

   [158] The statement of Andrew in the sixth book that Papias bore
   witness to the trustworthiness (to axiopiston) of the Apocalypse
   neither coincides with the assertion that Eusebius overlooked the
   testimony borne to the Johannean Apocalypse by Papias, nor, still less,
   with the suspicion uttered by Volkmar (p. 59) that Eusebius passed over
   this evidence "on account of his partisan feeling against the
   Apocalypse." It is decisive against this suspicion that Eusebius has
   mentioned Justin and Theophilus as credible witnesses for the
   Apocalypse.

   [159] Hilgenfeld sought to take away the force of this proof, and wrote
   in his journal, 1865, pt. 3, p. 335: "Manifestly it is quite a
   different thing if Eusebius does not hold, in regard to the epistle of
   Polycarp to the Philippians, the testimony in behalf of the epistle of
   Paul to this community, an epistle which is unquestionably Pauline in
   its origin; and merely remarks, though expressly, the use of the first
   epistle of Peter, which, although a subject of dispute, unquestionably
   belonged to the much contested catholic epistles." In more prudent
   fashion, however, Hilgenfeld mentions to his readers the epistle to the
   Philippians merely, to whom Polycarp himself writes, and does not
   mention that the extracts are taken from many other Pauline letters.

   [160] As lately as 1865, Hilgenfeld wrote: "How can the inference be
   drawn otherwise than that Eusebius searched carefully in Papias also
   for all evidences of New Testament writings, and failed to communicate
   anything respecting the canonical fourfoldness of the Gospels, and
   especially respecting the Gospel of John, only because he found no
   evidence? " "Who does not see that the fourfoldness of the canonical
   gospels had no existence at the time of Papias?"

   [161] See Volkmar i. a. 1. p. 61: "It is an entire distortion of the
   case for Tischendorf to try to trouble me with the ' absurdity' of the
   notion that Papias knew nothing of Luke as well: he may just as well
   have been acquainted with Luke's Gospel as with John's, but may have
   looked down upon both as too free, Paul-like, anti-Judaic-Christian and
   anti-chiliastic." "Although he does not defend himself exactly so in
   respect to the Gospel of Luke, the reason is that it was not enough
   held in common regard as Luco-Pauline, and he did not need his
   millenary traditions to defend himself against such a non-authority.
   What follows, therefore, from this nearer examination of the Papias
   contexts in relation to the Gospel of the Spirit's Parusia? Either he
   really did not become acquainted with it in his own Hierapolis, or he
   did not discover it with the superscription 'according to John,' and
   certainly not having canonical authority to be disowned by his silence.
   His testimony remains therefore unchanged; it must be taken without
   evasion. Papias's silence respecting Luke and John does not bear direct
   witness indeed for the non-existence of their Gospels, but for their
   non-apostolical authority; or rather that both Gospels were without
   apostolical authority with the larger number of contemporaries for whom
   Papias gathered and expounded his chiliastic traditions."

   [162] During my recent visit to Rome (March, 1866), Cardinal Pitra, the
   learned Benedictine, called my attention to this manuscript; yet
   Cardinal Jos. Mar. Thomasius had already given place to the prologue
   accompanying it in his collections (Opp. omnia, tom. i. Rome, 1747, p.
   344), where Dr. Aberle of Tubingen had noticed it, and learnedly
   discussed it in the first number of his Quarterly, 1864, pp. 1-47.

   [163] It is further stated: Disscripsit vero evangelium dictante
   lohanne recte. That the writer of this prologue wanted that this should
   be understood of John, the prologue prefixed to the Greek Catena text
   to John, and edited by Corderius, proves, which runs thus: hupagoreuse
   (sic)to euang. to heautou mathete Papia eubioto to Hierapolite. It is
   clear that this traditional statement is not to be reconciled with
   Eusebius. Directly subsequently in the prologue it runs: Verum Marcion
   hereticus cum ab eo (codex abe) fuisset improbatus, eo quod contraria
   sentiebat, abiectus est a Iohanne. Is vero scripta aut epistolas ad eum
   pertulerat a fratribus qui in ponto fuerunt. It has already been stated
   that this tradition respecting Marcion is not an isolated one.

   [164] III. 36: 1 is Presbyteri; directly after: Dicunt presbyteri
   apostolorum discipuli; and shortly before, in connection with the
   account of the reign of a thousand years: Presbyteri qui Johannem
   discipulum domini viderunt.

   [165] It has had a great many stadia to run through from its ancient
   use down to the present use by the Romish Church. After going through
   several hands in the third and fourth centuries, and after repeatedly
   undergoing revisions in accord with the Greek text, Jerome formed his
   text from it, not without reference moreover to Greek authorities which
   were allied to it. The use of the Romish Church gradually made this the
   Vulgate. It had, however, experienced many modifications, when the
   Roman Curia, towards the end of the sixteenth century, took advantage
   of the general diffusion of manuscripts to execute an official revision
   of the Vulgate, and it is this which now is authorized in the Roman
   Catholic Church.

   [166] It is an interesting memorial of the negative school of criticism
   at the present day, that its representatives, in part at least, take
   particular pleasure in basing their defense upon just those weighty
   scripture passages respecting whose want of authenticity the criticism
   which adheres closely to documentary evidence, as gained from the most
   recent discoveries, leaves no doubt at all. Among such passages may be
   reckoned the close of Mark's Gospel, the narrative respecting the
   adulteress in John, and the story of the descent of the angel into the
   pool of Bethesda in the fourth verse of the fifth chapter of the same
   Gospel. Certainly there can be no doubt that it far better subserves
   the ends opposed to apologetics to leave such apocryphal passages as
   these in both the Gospels mentioned, than by their omission to seem to
   give advantage to those who claim the apostolical origin of those
   Gospels. That that alliance between legitimism and its most determined
   opponents repeats itself on a political field, argues a wicked
   misunderstanding on the part of scholars of reputed orthodoxy.

   [167] Tas loipas graphas in this connection must be referred to other
   New Testament Scriptures. If those of the Old Testament were meant, the
   Pauline epistles would here be clearly placed upon the same footing
   with the Old Testament.

   [168] Verse 25, against whose genuineness most serious objections have
   long been expressed, has now in the primitive Codex Sinaiticus the most
   weighty authority against itself. (It has been an error that down to
   this time Cod. 63 has been cited in the same sense.)

   [169] For the purpose of superseding Grabe's extremely imperfect
   edition of this important work, I have long been making the requisite
   preparations in the English and French libraries. It was my good
   fortune to discover in 1844 an entirely unknown manuscript bearing on
   this matter, in the island of Patmos.

   [170] We can understand the remark of I. Nitzsch in 1810 (de Testam.
   xii. Patriarch. etc. Comm. critica, p. 17), that the author of this
   Testament could not have lived in the first century, since he alluded
   to almost all the books of the New Testament. "Si ante casum
   Hierosolymorum floruisset, hunc non tam diserte indicasset; sin omnino
   sæculo primo, non cognovisset ad quos fere omnes allusit Novi
   Testamenti libros."

Index of French Words and Phrases

     * La profonde sécheresse de la nature aux environs de Jérusalem
       devait ajouter an déplaisir de Jésus.: [322]1
     * N'excluant pas une certaine rivalité de l'auteur avec Pierre.:
       [323]1
     * On est tenté de croire que Jean . . . fut froissé de voir qu'on ne
       lui accordait pas dans l'histoire du Christ une assez grande place;
       qu'alors il commença à dicter une foule de choses qu'il savait
       mieux que les autres, avec l'intention de montrer que, dans
       beaucoup de cas où on ne parlait que de Pierre, il avait figuré
       avec et avant lui.: [324]1
     * Papias, qui avait recueilli avec passion les récits oraux de cet
       Aristion et de ce Presbyteros Joannes, ne dit pas un mot d'une Vie
       de Jésus écrite par Jean. Si une telle mention se fût trouvée dans
       son ouvrage, Eusèbe, qui relève chez lui tout ce qui sert à
       l'histoire littéraire du siècle apostolique, en eût sans aucun
       doute fait la remarque.: [325]1
     * Peut-être Lazare, pâle encore de sa maladie, se fit-il entourer de
       bandelettes comme un mort et enfermer dans son tombeau de
       famille. . . . L'emotion qu'éprouva Jésus près du tombeau de son
       ami, qu'il croyait mort, put être prise par les assistants pour ce
       trouble, ce frémissement qui accompagnaient les miracles; l'opinion
       populaire voulant que la vertu divine fût dans l'homme comme un
       principe épileptique et convulsif. Jésus . . . désira voir encore
       une fois celui qu'il avait aimé, et, la pierre ayant été écartée,
       Lazare sortit avec ses bandelettes et la tête entourée d'un suaire
       . . . Intimement persuadés que Jésus était thaumaturge, Lazare et
       ses deux soeurs purent aider un de ses miracles a s'exécuter
       . . . . L'état de leur conscience etait celui des stigmatisées, des
       convulsionnaires, des possédées de couvent. . . . Quant à Jesus, il
       n'était pas plus maître que Saint Bernard, que saint François
       d'Assise de modérer l'avidité de la foule et de ses propres
       disciples pour le merveilleux. La mort, d'ailleurs, allait dans
       quelques jours lui rendre sa liberté divine, et l'arracher aux
       fatales nécessités d'un rôle qui chaque jour devenait plus
       exigeant, plus difficile à soutenir.: [326]1
     * Sa haine contre Judas, haine antérieure peut-être a la trahison.:
       [327]1
     * Sa tête s'inclina sur sa poitrine, et il expira. Repose maintenant
       dans ta gloire, noble initiateur. Ton oeuvre est achevée; ta
       divinité est fondée. Ne crains plus de voir crouler par une faute
       l'édifice de tes efforts. Page 67. Toute l'historie du
       christianisme naissant est devenue de la sorte une délicieuse
       pastorale. Un Messie aux repas de noces, la courtisane et le bon
       Zachée appelés à ses festins, les fondateurs du royaume du ciel
       comme un cortége de paranymphes. Page 219. Le charmant docteur, qui
       pardonnait à tous pourvu qu'on l'aimât, ne pouvait trouver beaucoup
       d'écho dans ce sanctuaire des vaines disputes et des sacrifices
       vieillis. Page 222. L'orgueil du sang lui paraît l'ennemi capital
       qu'il faut combattre. Jésus, en d'autres termes, n'est plus juif.
       Il est révolutionnaire au plus haut degré; il appelle tous les
       hommes â un culte fondé sur leur seule qualité d'enfants de Dieu.
       Page 316. Parfois on est tenté de croire que, voyant dans sa propre
       mort un moyen de fonder son royaume, il conçut de propos délibéré
       le dessein de se faire tuer. D'autres fois la mort se présente à
       lui comme un sacrifice, destiné à apaiser son Père et à sauver les
       hommes. Un goût singulier de persécution et de supplices le
       pénétrait. Son sang lui paraissait comme l'eau d'un second baptême
       dont il devait être baigné, et il semblait possédé d'une hâte
       étrange d'aller au-devant de ce baptême qui seul pouvait étancher
       sa soif.: [328]1
     * Selon une tradition Jésus auralit trouvé un appui dans la propre
       femme du procurateur. Celle-ci avait pu entrevoir le doux Galiléen
       de quelque fenêtre du palais, donnant sur les cours du temple.
       Peut-être le revitelle en songe, et le sang de ce beau jeune homme,
       qui allait être versé, lui donna-t-il le cauchemar.: [329]1
     * Si jamais le monde resté chrétien, mais arrivé à une notion
       meilleure de ce qui constitue le respect des origines, veut
       remplacer par d'authentiques lieux saints les sanctuaires
       apocryphes et mesquins où s'attachait la piété des âges grossiers,
       c'est sur cette hauteur de Nazareth qu'il bâtira son temple. Là, au
       point d'apparition du christianisme et au centre d'action de son
       fondateur, devrait s'élever la grande église où tous les chrétiens
       pourraient prier. Là aussi, sur cette terre où dorment le
       charpentier Joseph et des milliers de Nazaréens oubliés.: [330]1
