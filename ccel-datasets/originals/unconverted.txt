  A SHORT

ACCOUNT

    OF

THE AUTHOR;

    AND

   The great Success which attended the CALL
   when first published.

   IT may be proper to prefix an account of this book given by Mr. Baxter
   himself, which was found in his study after his death, in his own
   words:

   "I published a short treatise on conversion, intitled, A Call to the
   Unconverted. The occasion of this was my converse with bishop Usher,
   while I was at London. who, approving my method and directions suited
   for peace of conscience, was importunate with me to write directions
   suited to the various states of Christians, and also against particular
   sins: I reverenced the man, but disregarded these persuasions,
   supposing I could do nothing but what is done better already: but when
   he was dead, his words went deeper to my mind, and I purposed to obey
   his counsel; yet, so as that to the first sort of men, (the ungodly), I
   thought vehement persuasions meeter than directions only; and so for
   such I published this little book, which God hath blessed with
   unexpected success, beyond all the rest that I have written, except
   "The Saint's Rest." In a little more than a year, there were about
   twenty thousand of them printed by my own consent, and about ten
   thousand since; beside many thousands by stolen impressions, which poor
   men stole for lucre sake.--Through God's mercy, I have information of
   almost whole households converted by this small book, which I set so
   light by; and, as if all this in England, Scotland, and Ireland, were
   not mercy enough to me, God (since I was silenced) hath sent it over on
   his message to many beyond the seas; for when Mr. Elliot had printed
   all the Bible in the Indian language, he next translated this my "Call
   to the Unconverted," as he wrote to us here.--And yet God would make
   some farther use of it; for Mr. Stoop, the pastor of the French Church
   in London, being driven hence by the displeasure of his superiors, was
   pleased to translate it into French. I hope it will not be unprofitable
   there, nor in Germany, when it is printed in Dutch."

   It may be proper further to mention Dr. Bates' account of the author,
   and of this useful Treatise.--In his sermon at Mr. Baxter's funeral, he
   thus says: "His books of practical divinity have been effectual for
   more conversions of sinners to God than any printed in our time: and
   while the church remains on earth, will be of continual efficacy to
   recover lost souls.--There is a vigorous pulse in them, that keeps the
   reader awake and attentive."--His Call to the Unconverted, how small in
   book, but how powerful in virtue! Truth speaks in it with that
   authority and efficacy, that it makes the reader to lay his hand upon
   his heart, and find that he hath a soul and a conscience, though he
   lived before as if he had none. He told some friends, that six brothers
   were converted by reading that Call, and that every week he received
   letters of some converted by his books. This he spake with most humbled
   thankfulness, that God was pleased to use him as an instrument for the
   salvation of souls."

   Self-denial and contempt of the world were shining graces in him. I
   never knew any person less indulgent to himself, and more indifferent
   to his temporal interest.

   His patience was truly Christian; he was tried by many afflictions. We
   are tender of our reputation. His name was obscured under a cloud of
   detraction: many scandalous darts were thrown at him. He was accused
   for his Paraphrase upon the New Testament, and condemned, unheard, to a
   prison, where he remained some years; but he was so far from being
   moved at the unrighteous prosecution, but he joyfully said to a
   constant friend, "What could I desire more of God, than having served
   him to my power, I should be called to suffer for him!"

   His pacific spirit was a clear character of his being a child of God.
   How ardently he endeavoured to cement the breaches amongst us is
   publicly known. He said to a friend, "I can as willing be a martyr for
   love as for any article of the creed."--It is strange, to astonishment,
   that those who agree in the substantial and great points of the
   reformed religion, and are of different sentiments only in things not
   so clear, nor of that moment as those wherein they consent, should be
   of opposite parties.

   Death reveals the secrets of the heart; then words are spoken with most
   feeling and least affectation. This excellent saint was the same in his
   life and death: his last hours were spent in preparing others and
   himself to appear before God. He said to his friends that visited him,
   "You come hither to learn to die, I am not the only person that must go
   this way: I can assure you, that your whole life, be it ever so long,
   is little enough to prepare for death. Have a care of this vain
   deceitful world and the lusts of the flesh: Be sure you choose God for
   your portion, heaven for your home, God's glory for your end, his word
   for your rule, and then you need never fear but we shall meet with
   comfort."

   Never was penitent sinner more humble and debasing, never was a sincere
   believer more calm and comfortable. He acknowledged himself to be the
   vilest dunghill-worm (it was his usual expression) that ever went to
   heaven; he admired the divine condescension to man, after saying "Lord,
   what is man? what am I? a vile worm to the great God!" Many times he
   prayed, "God be merciful to me a sinner!" and blessed God, that that he
   was left upon record in the Gospel as an effectual prayer: He said,
   "God may justly condemn me for the best duty I ever did; and all my
   hopes are from the free mercy of God in Christ," which he often prayed
   for.

   After a slumber he awaked and said, "I shall rest from my labour." A
   minister then present said, "and your work follow you." To whom he
   replied "No works! I will leave out works, if God will grant me the
   other."--When a friend was comforting him with the remembrance of the
   good many had received by his preaching and writings, he said, "I was
   but a pen in God's hand, and what praise is due to a pen?"

   His resigned submission to the will of God, in his sharp sickness, was
   eminent. When extremity of pain constrained him earnestly to pray to
   God for his release by death, he would check himself: "It is not fit
   for me to prescribe;" and said, "when thou wilt, what thou wilt."

   At another time he said, "That he found great comfort and sweetness in
   repeating the words of the Lord's prayer; and was sorry that some good
   people were prejudiced against the use of it; for, there were all
   necessary petitions for soul and body contained in it."

   At other times he gave excellent counsel to young ministers that
   visited him, and earnestly prayed to God to bless their labours, and
   make them very successful in converting many souls to Christ; and
   expressed great joy that they were of moderate peaceful spirits.

   During his sickness, when the question was asked, how he did, his reply
   was, "almost well," His joy was most remarkable when in his own
   apprehension death was nearest; and his spiritual joy was at length
   consummate in eternal joy.

   Thus lived and died that blessed saint.--I have, without any artificial
   fiction in words, given a sincere short account of him. All our tears
   are below the just grief for such an invaluable loss. It is the comfort
   of his friends that he enjoys a blessed reward in heaven, and hath left
   a precious remembrance on earth.

   Now, blessed be the gracious God, that he was pleased to prolong the
   life of his servant, so useful and beneficial to the world, to a full
   age: that he hath brought him slowly and safely to heaven.

   I shall conclude this account with my own deliberate wish: "May I live
   the remainder of my life as entirely to the glory of God as he lived;
   and when I shall come to the period of my life, may I die in the same
   blessed peace wherein he died: may I be with him in the kingdom of
   light and love for ever."

   I shall also add Dr. Calamy's account of this Treatise; his words are
   thus: "In 1657, Mr. Baxter published a Call to the Unconverted; a book
   blessed by God with marvellous success, in reclaiming persons from
   their impieties. Twenty thousand of them were printed and dispersed in
   little more than a year. It was translated into French, and Dutch, and
   other European languages; and Mr. Elliot translated it into the Indian
   language; and Mr. Cotton Mather, in his life, gives an account of an
   Indian prince, who was so well affected with this book, that he sat
   reading it, with tears in his eyes, till he died."

PREFACE

   To all unsanctified Persons that shall read this Book; especially of my
   Hearers in the Borough and Parish of Kiaderminster.

   Men and Brethren,

   THE eternal God, that made you for a life everlasting, and hath
   redeemed you by his only Son, when you had lost it and yourselves,
   being mindful of you in your sin and misery, hath indited the gospel,
   and sealed it by his spirit, and commanded his ministers to preach it
   to the world, that pardon being freely offered you, and heaven being
   set before you, he might call you off from your fleshly pleasures, and
   from following after this deceitful world, and acquaint you with the
   life that you were created and redeemed for, before you are dead and
   past remedy. He sendeth you not prophets or apostles, that receive
   their message by immediate revelation; but yet he calleth you by his
   ordinary ministers, who are commissioned by him to preach the same
   gospel which Christ and his apostles first delivered. The Lord seeth
   how you forget him and your latter end, and how light you make of
   everlasting things, as men that understand not what they have to do or
   suffer. He seeth how bold you are in sin, and how fearless threatnings,
   and how careless of your souls, and how the works of infidels are in
   your lives, while the belief of Christians is in your mouths. He seeth
   the dreadful day at hand, when your sorrows will begin, and you must
   lament all this with fruitless cries in torment and desperation; and
   then the remembrance of your folly will tear your hearts, if true
   conversion now prevent it not. In compassion of your sinful miserable
   souls, the Lord, that better knows your case than you can know it, hath
   made it our duty to speak to you in his name, 2 Cor. v. 19. and to tell
   you plainly of your sin and misery, and what will be your end, and how
   sad a change you will shortly see, if yet you go on a little longer.
   Having bought you at so dear a rate as the blood of his son Jesus
   Christ, and made you so free and general promise of pardon, and grace,
   and everlasting glory; he commandeth us to tender all this to you, as
   the gift of God, and to intreat you to consider of the necessity and
   worth of what he offereth.--He seeth and pitieth you, while you are
   drowned in worldly cares and pleasures, and eagerly following childish
   toys, and wasting that short and precious time for a thing of nought,
   in which you should make ready for an everlasting life; and therefore
   he high commanded us to call after you, and tell you how you lose your
   labour, and are about to lose your souls, and to tell you what greater
   and better things you might certainly have, if you would hearken to his
   Call, Isa. lv. 1, 2, 3. We believe and obey the voice of God; and come
   to you on his message, who hath charged us to preach, and be instant
   with you in season and out of season, and to lift up our voice like a
   trumpet, and shew your transgressions and your sins, Isa. lviii. 1. 2
   Tim. iv. 1, 2. But alas! to the grief of our souls and your own
   undoing, you stop your ears, you stiffen your necks, you harden your
   hearts, and send us back to God with groans, to tell him that we have
   done his message, but can do no good on you, nor scarcely get a sober
   hearing.--Oh! that our eyes were a fountain of tears, that we might
   lament our ignorant, careless people, that have Christ before them, and
   pardon, and life, and heaven before them, and that have not hearts to
   know or value them! that might have Christ, and grace, and glory, as
   well as others, if it were not for their wilfill negligence and
   contempt! O that the Lord would fill our hearts with more compassion to
   these miserable souls, that we might cast ourselves even at their feet,
   and follow them to their houses, and speak to them with our bitter
   tears: For, long have we preached to many of them in vain: We study
   plainness to make them understand, and many of them will not understand
   us; we study serious, piercing words, to make them feel, but they will
   not feel. If the greatest matters would work with them, we should awake
   them; if the sweetest things would work, we should entice them and win
   their hearts; if the most dreadful things would work, we should at
   least affright them from their wickedness; if truth and certainty would
   take with them, we should soon convince them; if the God that made
   them, and the Christ that bought them, might be heard, the case would
   soon be altered with them; if scripture might be heard, we should soon
   prevail; if reason, even the best and strongest reason, might be heard,
   we should not doubt but we should speedily convince them; if experience
   might be heard, even their own experience, and the experience of all
   the world, the matter would be mended; yea, if the conscience within
   them might be heard, the case would be better with them than it is. But
   if nothing can be heard, what then shall we do for them? If the
   dreadful God of heaven be slighted, who then shall be regarded? If the
   inestimable love and blood of a Redeemer be made light of, what then
   shall be valued? If heaven have no desirable glory with them, and
   everlasting joys be nothing worth, if they can jest at hell, and dance
   about the bottomless pit, and play with the consuming fire, and that
   when God and man do warn them of it; what shall we do for such souls as
   these?

   Once more, in the name of the God of heaven, I shall do the message to
   you which he hath commanded us, and leave it in these standing lines to
   convert you or to condemn you; to change you, or to rise up in judgment
   against you, and to be a witness to your faces, that once you had a
   serious call to turn. Hear, all you that are drudges of the world, and
   the servants of flesh and Satan! that spend your days in looking after
   prosperity on earth, and drown your consciences in drinking, and
   gluttony, and idleness, and foolish sports, and know your sin, and yet
   will sin, as if you set God at defiance, and bid him do his worst and
   spare not! Hearken, all you that mind not God, and have no heart to
   holy things, and feel no favour in the word or worship of the Lord, or
   in the thoughts or mention of eternal life, that are careless of your
   immortal souls, and never bestow one hour in inquiring what case they
   are in, whether sanctified or unsanctified, and whether you are ready
   to appear before the Lord! Hearken, all you that, by sinning in the
   light, have dinned yourselves into infidelity, and do not believe the
   word of God. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear the gracious and
   yet the dreadful call of God! His eye is all this while upon you. Your
   sins are registered, and you shall surely hear of them again. God
   keepeth the book now; and he will write it all upon your consciences
   with his terrors; and then you also shall keep it yourselves: O
   sinners, that you knew but what you are doing! and whom you are all
   this while offending! the sun itself is darkness before that Majesty,
   which you daily abuse and carelessly provoke. The sinning angels were
   not able to stand before him, but were cast down to be tormented with
   devils. And dare such silly worms as you so carelessly offend, and set
   yourselves against your Maker! O that you did but a little know what
   case that wretched soul is in, that hath engaged the living God against
   him! The words of his mouth, that made thee, can unmake thee; the frown
   of his face will cut thee off and cast thee out into utter darkness.
   How eager are the devils to be doing with thee that have tempted thee,
   and do but wait for the word from God to take and use thee as their
   own! and then in a moment thou wilt be in hell. If God be against thee,
   all things are against thee: this world is but thy prison, for all thou
   so lovest it; thou art but reserved in it to the day of wrath, Job xxi.
   30. the Judge is coming, thy soul is even going. Yet a little while,
   and thy friend shall say of thee, "He is dead;" and thou shalt see the
   things that thou now dost despise, and feel that which now thou wilt
   not believe. Death will bring such an argument as thou canst not
   answer; an argument that shall effectually confute thy cavils against
   the words and ways of God, and all thy self-conceited dotages. And then
   how soon will thy mind be changed? Then be an unbeliever if thou canst;
   stand then to all thy former words, which thou wast wont to utter
   against a holy and a heavenly life. Make good that cause then before
   the Lord, which thou wast wont to plead against thy teachers, and
   against the people that feared God. Then stand to thy old opinions and
   contemptuous thoughts of the diligence of the saints; make ready now
   thy strongest reasons, and stand up then before the Judge, and plead
   like a man for thy fleshly, thy worldly, and ungodly life. But know
   that thou wilt have One to plead with, that will not be outfaced by
   thee; nor so easily put off as we thy fellow-creatures. O poor soul!
   there is nothing but a slender veil of flesh between thee and that
   amazing sight, which will quickly silence thee, and turn thy tone, and
   make thee of another mind! As soon as death hath drawn this curtain,
   thou shalt see first which will quickly leave thee speechless. And how
   quickly will that day and hour come! When thou hast had but a few more
   merry hours, and but a few more pleasant draughts and morsels, and a
   little more of the honours and riches of the world, thy portion will be
   spent, and thy pleasures ended, and all is then gone that thou settest
   thy heart upon; of all, that thou soldest thy Saviour and salvation
   for, there is nothing left but the heavy reckoning. As a thief, that
   sits merrily spending the money in an alehouse which he hath stolen,
   when men are riding in post-haste to apprehend him, so it is with you.
   While you are drowned in cares or fleshly pleasures, and making merry
   with your own shame, death is coming in post-haste to seize upon you,
   and carry your souls to such a place and state as now you little know
   or think of. Suppose, when you were bold and busy in your sin, that a
   messenger were but coming post from London to apprehend you and take
   away your lives; though you saw him not, yet if you knew that he was
   coming, it would mar your mirth, and you would be thinking of the haste
   he makes, and hearkening when he knocked at your door. O that you could
   but see what haste death makes, tho' yet he hath not overtaken you! No
   post so swift! No messenger more sure! As sure as the sun will be with
   you in the morning, though it hath many thousand and hundred thousand
   miles to go in the night, so sure will death be quickly with you; and
   then where is your sport and pleasure? Then will you jest and brave it
   out? Then will you jeer at them that warned you? Then is it better to
   be a believing saint or a sensual worldling? "And then whose shall all
   these things be" that you have gathered? Luke xii. 19, 20 , 21. Do you
   not observe that days and weeks are quickly gone, and nights and
   mornings come apace, and speedily succeed each other? You sleep, "but
   your damnation slumbereth not," you linger, "but your judgment this
   long time lingereth not," 2 Pet. ii. 3, 4, 5. to which "you are
   reserved for punishment," 2 Pet. ii. 8, 9.--O that you were wise to
   understand this, and that you did consider your latter end," Deut.
   xxxii. 29--"He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear the call of God
   in this day of his salvation."

   O careless sinners! that you did but know the love that you
   unthankfully neglect, and the preciousness of the blood of Christ which
   you despise! O that you did but know the riches of the gospel! O that
   you did but know, a little know, the certainty, and the glory, and
   blessedness, of that everlasting life, which now you will not set your
   hearts upon, nor be persuaded first and diligently to seek, Heb. xi. 6.
   and xii. 28. Matt. vi. 12. Did you but know the endless life with God
   which you now neglect, how quickly would you cast away your sin, how
   quickly would you change your mind and life, your course and company,
   and turn the streams of your affections, and lay your care another way!
   How resolutely would you scorn to yield to such temptations as now
   deceive you and carry you away! How zealously would you bestir
   yourselves for that most blessed life! How earnest would you be with
   God in prayer! How diligent in hearing, and learning, and
   inquiring!--How serious in meditating on the laws of God! (Psal. i. 2.)
   How fearful of sinning in thought, word, or deed; and how careful to
   please God and grow in holiness!--O what a changed people you would be!
   And why should not the certain word of God be believed by you, and
   prevail with you, which, openeth to you these glorious and eternal
   things?

   Yea, let me tell you, that even here on earth, ye little know the
   difference between the life which you refuse, and the life which you
   would choose. The sanctified are conversing with God, when you dare
   scarce think of him, and when you are conversing with but earth and
   flesh.--Their conversation is in heaven, when you are utter strangers
   to it, and your belly is your God, and you are minding earthly things,
   Phil. iii. 18, 19, 20. They are seeking after the face of God, when you
   seek for nothing higher than this world.--They are busily laying out
   for an endless life, where they shall be equal with the angels, Luke
   xx. 36. when you are taken up with a shadow and a transitory thing of
   naught. How long and base is your earthly, fleshly, sinful life, in
   comparison of the noble, spiritual lfe of true believers! Many a time
   have I looked on such men with grief and pity, to see them trudge about
   the world, and spend their lives, and care, and labour, for nothing but
   a little food and raiment, or a little fading pelf, or fleshly
   pleasures, or empty honours, as if they had no higher things to
   mind.--What difference is there between the lives of these men and of
   the beasts that perish, that spend their time in working, and eating,
   and living, but that they may live? They taste not of the inward
   heavenly pleasures which believers taste and live upon.--I had rather
   have a little of their comfort, which the fore-thoughts of their
   heavenly inheritance afford them, though I had all their scorns and
   sufferings with it, than to have all your pleasures and treacherous
   prosperity. I would not have one of your secret gripes and pangs of
   conscience, and dark and dreadful thoughts of death and the life to
   come, for all that ever the world hath done for you, or all that you
   can reasonably hope that it should do. If I were in your unconverted
   carnal state, and knew but what I know, and believed but what I now
   believe, methinks my life would he a fore-taste of hell: How oft should
   I be thinking of the terrors of the Lord of the dismal day that is
   hastening on! Sure death and hell would be still before me. I should
   think of them by day, and dream of them by night; I should lie down in
   fear, and rise in fear, and live in fear, lest death should come before
   I were converted. I should have small felicity in any thing that I
   possessed, and little pleasure in any company, and little joy in any
   thing in the world, as long as I knew myself to be under the curse and
   wrath of God. I should be still afraid of hearing that voice, Luke xii.
   20. "Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee." And
   that fearful sentence would he written upon my conscience, Isa. xlviii.
   22. and lvii. 21. "There is no peace, faith my God, to the wicked."--O
   poor sinners! it is a joyfuller life than this that you might live, if
   you were but but truly willing, to hearken to Christ, and come home to
   God. You might then draw near to God, with boldness, and call him your
   father, and comfortably trust him with your souls and bodies. If you
   look upon the promises, you may say, they are all mine: If upon the
   curse, you may say, from this I am delivered! When you read the law,
   you may see what you are saved from!--When you read the gospel, you may
   see him that redeemed you, and see the course of his love, and holy
   life, and sufferings, and trace him in his temptations, tears, and
   blood, in the work of your salvation. You may see death conquered, and
   heaven opened, and your resurrection and glorification provided for in
   the resurrection and glorification of your Lord. If you look on the
   saints, you may say, "They are my brethren and companions." If on the
   unsanctified you may rejoice to think that you are saved from that
   state. If you look upon the heavens, the sun, and moon, and stars
   innumerable, you may think and say, "My Father's face is infinitely
   more glorious; it is higher matters that he hath prepared for his
   saints; yonder is but the outward court of heaven: The blessedness that
   he hath promised us is so much higher that flesh and blood cannot
   behold it." If you think of the grave, you may remember that the
   glorified Spirit, a living Head, and a loving Father, have all so near
   relation to your dust, that it cannot be forgotten or neglected, but
   more certainly revive than the plants and flowers in the spring,
   because that the soul is still alive, that is the root of the body; and
   Christ is alive, that is the root of both.--Even death, which is the
   king of fears, may be remembered and entertained with joy, as being the
   day of your deliverance from the remnants of sin and sorrow, and the
   day which you believed, and hoped, and waited for, when you shall see
   the blessed things which you had heard of, and shall find, by present
   joyful experience, what it was to choose the better part, and to be a
   sincere believing saint. What say you, Sir? is not this a more
   delightful life, to be assured of salvation, and ready to die, than to
   live as the ungodly, that have their hearts overcharged with surfeiting
   and drunkenness and the cares of this life, and so that day comes upon
   them unawares? Luke xxi. 34, 36. Might you not live a comfortable life,
   if once you were made the heirs of heaven, and sure to be saved when
   you leave the world?--O look about you then, and think what you do, and
   cast not away such hopes as these for very nothing. The flesh and world
   can give you no such hopes or comforts.

   And, besides all the misery that you bring upon yourselves, you are the
   troublers of others as long as you are unconverted. You trouble
   magistrates to rule you by their laws; you trouble ministers by
   resisting the light and guidance which they offer you. Your sin and
   misery are the greatest grief and trouble to them in the world.--You
   trouble the commonwealth, and draw the judgments of God upon you. It is
   you that most disturb the holy peace and order of the churches, and
   hinder our union and reformation, and are the shame and trouble of the
   churches where you intrude, and of the places where you are.--Ah! Lord,
   how heavy and sad a case is this, that even in England, where the
   gospel doth abound above any other nation in the world, where teaching
   is so plain and common, and all the helps we can desire is at hand;
   when the sword hath been hewing us, and judgment hath run as a fire
   through the Land; when deliverances have relieved us, and so many
   admirable mercies have engaged us to God, and to the gospel, and a holy
   life; that after all this, our cities, and towns, and countries, shall
   abound with multitudes of unsanctified men, and swarm with so much
   sensuality, as every where, to our grief, we see! One would have
   thought, that after all this light, and all this experience, and all
   these judgments and mercies of God, the people of this nation should
   have joined together, as one man, to turn to the Lord, and should have
   come to their godly teacher, and lamented all their former sins, and
   desired him to join with them in public humiliation, to confess them
   openly, and beg pardon of them from the Lord, and should have craved
   his instruction for the time to come, and be glad to be ruled by the
   spirit within, and the ministers of Christ without, according to the
   word of God. One would think that, after such reason and
   scripture-evidence as they hear, and after all these means and mercies,
   there should not be an ungodly person left amongst us, nor a wordling,
   nor a drunkard, nor a hater of reformation, nor an enemy to holiness,
   to be found in all our towns or countries. If we be not all agreed
   about some ceremonies or forms of government, one would think that,
   before this, we should have been all agreed to live a holy and heavenly
   life, in obedience to God, his word, and ministers, and in love and
   peace with one another.--But alas! how far are our people from this
   course! Most of them, in most places, do set their hearts on earthly
   things, and seek "not first the kingdom of God and the righteousness
   thereof," but look at holiness as a needless thing: Their families are
   prayerless, or else a few heartless lifeless words must serve instead
   of hearty, fervent, daily prayers [or perhaps only on the Lord's-day in
   the evening]; their children are not taught the knowledge of Christ,
   and the covenant of grace, nor brought up in the nurture of the Lord,
   though they firmly promised all this in their baptism.

   They instruct not their servants in the matters of salvation, but so
   their work be done they care not. There are more railing speeches in
   their families than gracious words that tend to edification. How few
   are the families that fear the Lord, and inquire at his word and
   ministers how they should live, and what they should do, and are
   willing to be taught and ruled, and that heartily look after
   everlasting life! And those few that God hath made so happy are
   commonly the by-word of their neighbours; when we see some live in
   drunkenness, and some in pride and worldliness, and most of them have
   little care of their salvation, though the cause be gross and past all
   controversy, yet will they hardly be convinced of their misery, and
   more hardly recovered and reformed: but when we have done all that we
   are able to save them from their sins, we leave the most of them as we
   find them. And if, according to the law of God, we cast them out of the
   communion of the church, when they have obstinately rejected all our
   admonitions, they rage at us as if we were their enemies, and their
   hearts are filled with malice against us, and they will sooner set
   themselves against the Lord and his laws, and church, and ministers,
   than against their deadly sins. This is the doleful case of England: We
   have magistrates that countenance the ways of godliness, and a happy
   opportunity for unity and reformation is before us, and faithful
   ministers long to see the right ordering of the church and of the
   ordinances of God; but the power of sin in our people doth frustrate
   almost all. No where can almost a faithful minister set up the
   unquestionable discipline of Christ, or put back the most scandalous
   impenitent sinners from the communion of the church and participation
   of the sacraments, but the most of the people rail at them and revile
   them; as if these ignorant careless souls were wiser than their
   teachers, or than God himself. And thus in the day of our visitation,
   when God calls upon us to reform his church, though magistrates seem
   willing, and faithful ministers seem willing, yet are the multitude of
   the people still unwilling, and have so blinded themselves, and
   hardened their hearts, that, even in these days of light and grace,
   they are the obstinate enemies of light and grace, and will not be
   brought by the calls of God to see their folly, and know what is for
   their good. O that the people of England "knew at least in this their
   day the things that belong unto their peace, before they are hid from
   their eyes!" Luke xix. 42.

   O foolish miserable souls! Gal. iii. 1. who hath bewitched your minds
   into such madness, and your hearts into such deadness, that you should
   be such mortal enemies to yourselves, and go on so obstinately towards
   damnation, that neither the word of God, nor the persuasions of men,
   can change your minds, or hold your hands, or stop you, till you are
   past remedy! Well, sinners! this life will not last always; this
   patience will nor wait upon you still. Do not think that you shall
   abuse your Maker and Redeemer, and serve his enemies, and debase your
   souls, and trouble the world, and wrong the church, and reproach the
   godly, and grieve your teachers, and hinder reformation, and all this
   upon free cost. You know not yet what this must cost you, but you must
   shortly know, when the righteous God shall take you in hand, who will
   handle you in another manner than the sharpest magistrates or the
   plainest-dealing pastors did, unless you prevent the everlasting
   torments by a sound conversion, and a speedy obeying of the call of
   God. "He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear," while mercy hath a
   voice to call.

   One objection I find most common in the mouths of the ungodly,
   especially of late years: they say, "We can do nothing without God, we
   cannot have grace if God will not give it us; and, if he will, we shall
   quickly turn; if he have not predestinated us, and will not turn us,
   how can we turn ourselves or be saved; it is not in him that wills nor
   in him that runs." And thus they think they are excused.

   I have answered this formerly, and in this book: but let me now say
   this much.--1. Though you cannot cure yourselves, you can hurt and
   poison yourselves. It is God that must sanctify your hearts; but who
   corrupted them? Will you wilfully take poison, because you cannot cure
   yourselves? Methinks you should the more forbear it. You should the
   more take heed of sinning, if you cannot mend what sin doth mar.--2.
   Though you cannot be converted without the special grace of God, yet
   you must know that God giveth his grace in the use of his holy means
   which he hath appointed to that end; and common grace may enable you to
   forbear your gross sinning (as to the outward act) and to use those
   means. Can you truly say, that you do as much as you are able to do?
   Are you not able to go by an alehouse-door, or to forbear the company
   that hardeneth you in sin? Are you not able to hear the word, and think
   of what you heard when you come home, and to consider with yourselves
   of your own condition and of everlasting things ? Are you not able to
   read good books from day to day, at least the Lord's-day, and to
   converse with those that fear the Lord? You cannot say you have done
   what you are able.--3. And therefore you must know that you can forfeit
   the grace and help of God by your wilful sinning or negligence, though
   you cannot, without grace, turn to God. If you will not do what you
   can, it is just with God to deny you that grace by which you might do
   more. 4. And, for God's decrees, you must know that they separate not
   the end and means, but tie them together. God never decreed to save any
   but the sanctified, nor to damn any but the unsanctified. God doth as
   truly decree whether your land, this year, than be barren or fruitful,
   and just how long you shall live in the world, as he hath decreed
   whether you shall be saved or not; and yet you would think that man but
   a fool that would forbear ploughing and sowing, and say, "If God have
   decreed that my ground shall bear corn, it will bear, whether I plough
   and sow or not. If God have decreed that I shall live, I shall live,
   whether I eat or not; but if he have not, it is not eating that will
   keep me alive." Do you know how to answer such a man, or do you not? If
   you do, then you know how to answer yourselves; for the case is alike
   God's decree is as peremptory about your bodies as your souls: if you
   do not, then try first, there conclusions upon your bodies, before you
   venture to try them on your soul: see first whether God will keep you
   alive without food or raiment, and whether he will give you corn
   without tillage and labour, and whether he will bring you to your
   journey's end without a travail or carriage; and, if you speed well in
   this, then try whether he will bring you to heaven without your
   diligent use of means, and sit down and say, We cannot sanctify
   ourselves.

   Well, Sirs, I have but three requests to you, and I have done.

   First, That you will seriously read over this small Treatise; (and, if
   you have such as need it in your families, that you would read it over
   and over to them; and if those that fear God would go now and then to
   their ignorant neighbour, and read this or some other book to them on
   this subject, they might be a means of winning of souls). If we cannot
   intreat so small a labour of men, for their own salvation, as to read
   such short instructions as these, they set little by themselves, and
   will most justly perish.

   Secondly, When you have read over this book, I would intreat you to go
   alone, and ponder a little what you have read, and bethink you, as in
   the sight of God, whether it be not true, and do not nearly touch your
   souls, anti whether it be not time to took about you. And also intreat
   you, that you will upon your knees beseech the Lord that he will open
   your eyes to understand the truth, and turn your hearts to the love of
   God, and beg of him all that saving grace which you have so long
   neglected, and follow it on from day to day, till your hearts be
   changed.--And withal, that you will go to your pastors, (that are set
   over you, to take care of the health and safety of your souls, as
   physicians do for the health of your bodies), and desire them to direct
   you what course to take, and acquaint them with your spiritual estate,
   and that you may have the benefit of their advice and ministerial help.

   Or, if you have not a faithful pastor at home, make use of some other
   in so great a need.

   Thirdly, When by reading, consideration, prayer, and ministerial
   advice, you are once acquainted with your sin and misery, with your
   duty and remedy, delay not, but presently forsake your sinful company
   and courses, and turn to God, and obey his call. As you love your
   souls, take heed that you go not on against so loud a call of God, and
   against your own knowledge and consciences, lest it go worse with you
   in the day of judgment than with Sodom and Gomorrah. Inquire of God, as
   a man that is willing to know the truth, and not be a wilful cheater of
   his soul. Search the holy scriptures daily, and see whether these
   things be so or not; try impartially whether it be safer to trust
   heaven or earth, and whether it be better to follow God or man, the
   spirit or the flesh, and better to live in holiness or sin, and whether
   an unsanctified estate be safe for you to abide in one day longer; and,
   when you have found out which is best resolve accordingly, and make
   your choice without any more ado. If you will be true to your own
   souls, and do not love everlasting torments, I beseech you, as from the
   Lord, that you will but take this reasonable advice. O what happy towns
   and countries, and what a happy nation might we have, if we could but
   persuade our neighbours to agree to such a necessary motion! What
   joyful men would all faithful ministers be, if they could but see their
   people truly heavenly and holy; this would be the unity, the peace, the
   safety, the glory, of our churches; the happiness of our neighbours,
   and the comfort of our souls. Then how comfortably should we preach
   pardon and peace to you, and deliver the sacraments, which are the
   seals of peace to you! And with what love and joy might we live among
   you! At your death-bed how boldly might we comfort and encourage your
   departing souls! And at your burial, how comfortably might we leave you
   in the grave, in expectation to meet your souls in heaven, and to see
   your bodies raised to that glory!

   But, if still the most of you will go on in a careless, ignorant,
   fleshly, worldly, or unholy life, and all our desires and labours
   cannot so far prevail as to keep you from the wilful damning of
   yourselves; we must then imitate our Lord, who delighteth himself in
   those few that are jewels, and in the little flock that shall receive
   the kingdom, when the most shall reap the misery which they sowed. In
   nature excellent things are few. The world hath not many suns or moons:
   it is but a little of the earth that is gold or silver. Princes and
   nobles are but a small part of the sons of men; and it is no great
   number that are learned, judicious, or wise, here in the world. And
   therefore, if the gate being strait and very narrow, there be but few
   that find salvation, yet God will have his glory and pleasure in those
   few. And when Christ shall come with his mighty angels in flaming fire,
   taking vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the gospel of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, his coming will be glorified in his saints, and
   admired in all true believers, 2 Thess. i. 7, 8, 9, 10.

   And for the rest, as God the Father vouchsafed to create them, and God
   the Son disdained not to bear the penalty of their sins upon the cross,
   and did not judge such sufferings in vain, though he knew that by
   refusing the sanctifications of the Holy Ghost they would finally
   destroy themselves, so we, that are his ministers, though these be not
   gathered, judge not our labour wholly lost. See Isa. xlix. 5.

   Reader, I have done with thee, (when thou hast perused this book), but
   sin hath not yet done with thee, (even those that thou thoughtest had
   been forgotten long ago), and Satan hath not yet done with thee,
   (though now he be out of sight) and God hath not yet done with thee,
   because thou wilt not be persuaded to have done with the deadly
   reigning sin. I have written thee this persuasive as one that is going
   into another world, where the things are seen that I here speak of, and
   as one that knoweth thou must be shortly there thyself. As ever thou
   wilt meet me with comfort before the Lord that made us; as ever thou
   wilt escape the everlasting plagues prepared for the final neglectors
   of salvation; and for all that are not sanctified by the Holy Ghost,
   and love not the communion of the saints, as members of the holy
   catholic church; and as ever thou hopest to see the face of Christ the
   judge, and of the majesty of the Father, with peace and comfort, and to
   be received into glory when thou art turned naked out of this world; I
   beseech thee, I charge thee, to hear and obey the Call of Go4, and
   resolvedly to turn that thou mayest live. But, if thou wilt not, even
   when thou hast no true reason for it but because thou wilt not, I
   summon thee to answer it before the Lord, and require thee there to
   bear me witness that I gave thee warning, and that thou wast not
   condemned for want of a call to turn and live, but because thou
   wouldest not believe it and obey it; which also must be the testimony
   of

   Thy serious Monitor,

   Dec. 11, 1657.

     __________________________________________________________________

SERMON I.

   Ezek. xxxiii. 11.

   Say to them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
   death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.
   Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways, for, why will ye die, O house of
   Israel?

   IT hath been the astonishing wonder of many a man, as well as me, to
   read in the holy Scripture, how few will be saved; and that the
   greatest part, even of those that are called, will be everlastingly
   shut out of the kingdom of heaven, and be tormented with the devils in
   eternal fire. Infidels believe not this when they read it, and
   therefore they must feel it. Those that do believe it are forced to cry
   out with Paul, Rom. xi. 33, "O the depth of the riches both of the
   wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and
   his ways past finding out!" but nature itself doth teach us all to lay
   the blame of evil works upon the doers, and therefore, when we see any
   heinous thing done, a principle of justice doth provoke us to inquire
   after him that did it, that the evil of the work may return the evil of
   shame upon the author. If we saw a man killed and cut in pieces we
   would presently ask, "Oh! who did this cruel deed?" If the town was
   wilfully set on fire, you would ask, "what wicked wretch did this?" So
   when we read that most will be firebrands of hell for ever, we must
   needs think with ourselves, how comes this to pass? and who is it long
   of? who is it that is so cruel as to be the cause of such a thing as
   this? and we can meet with few that will own the guilt. It is indeed
   confessed by all that Satan is the cause: but that doth not resolve the
   doubt, because he is not the principal cause. He doth not force men to
   sin, but tempt them to it; and leaves it to their own wills whether
   they will do it or not: he doth not carry men to an alehouse and force
   open their mouths, and pour in the drink; nor doth he hold them that
   they cannot go to God's service; nor doth he force their hearts from
   holy thoughts. It lieth therefore between God himself and the sinner;
   one of them must needs be the principal cause of all this misery,
   whichever it is; for there is no other to cast it upon; and God
   disclaimeth it; he will not take it upon him: and the wicked disclaim
   it usually, and they will not take it upon them. And this is the
   controversy that is here managed in my text.

   The Lord complaineth of the people; and the people think it is the
   fault of God. The same controversy is handled, chap. xvii. ver. 25.
   where they plainly say, "that the way of the Lord is not equal:" and
   God saith, "it is their ways that are not equal." So here they say, in
   verse 9, "If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine
   away in them, how shall we then live?" As if they should say, if we
   must die, and be miserable, how can we help it? as if it were not long
   of them, but God. But God in my text doth clear himself of it, and
   telleth them how they may help it if they will, and persuadeth them to
   use means, and if they will not be persuaded, he lets them know that it
   is long of themselves; and, if this will not satisfy them, he will not
   therefore forbear to punish them. It is he that will be their judge,
   and he will judge them according to their ways; they are no judges of
   him or themselves, as wanting authority, and wisdom, and impartiality.
   Nor is it the cavilling with God, that shall serve their turn, or save
   them from the execution of justice, at which they murmur.

   The words of this verse contain: 1. God's clearing of himself from the
   blame of their destruction. This he doth not by disowning his judgments
   and execution according to that law, or by giving them any hope that
   the law shall not be executed; but by professing that it is not their
   death that he takes pleasure in, but their returning rather, that they
   may live: and this he confirmeth to them by his oath. 2. An express
   exhortation to the wicked to return, wherein God doth not only command,
   but persuade and condescend also to reason the case with them, why will
   they die? The direct end of his exhortation is, that they may turn and
   live. The secondary or reserved ends, upon supposition that this is not
   attained, are these two: First, to convince them by the means which he
   used, that it is not the long of God if they be miserable. Secondly, to
   convince them from their manifest wilfulness in rejecting all his
   commands and persuasions, that it is the long of themselves; and they
   die, because they will die.

   The substance of the text doth lie in these observations following.

   Doct. 1. It is the unchangeable law of God, that wicked men must turn
   or die.

   Doct. 2. It is the promise of God, that the wicked shall live, if they
   will but turn.

   Doct. 3. God taketh pleasure in men's conversion and salvation; but not
   in their death or damnation: he had rather they would return and live,
   than go on and die.

   Doct. 4. This is a most certain truth, which because God would not have
   men to question, he hath confirmed it to them solemnly by his oath.

   Doct. 5. The Lord doth redouble his commands and persuasions to the
   wicked to turn

   Doct. 6. The Lord condescendeth to reason the case with them, and
   asketh the wicked, why they will die?

   Doct. 7. If after all this the wicked will not turn, it is not the long
   of God that they perish, but of themselves; their own wilfulness is the
   cause of their damnation; they therefore die, because they will die.

   Having laid the text open before your eyes in these plain propositions,
   I shall next speak somewhat of each of them in order, though briefly.

   Doct. 1. It is the unchangeable law of God, that wicked men must turn
   or die.

   If you will believe God, believe this: there is but one of these two
   ways for every wicked man, either conversion or damnation. I know the
   wicked will hardly be persuaded either of the truth or equity of this.
   No wonder if the guilty quarrel with the law. Few men are apt to
   believe that which they would not have to be true, and fewer would have
   that to be true, which they apprehend to be against them. But it is not
   quarrelling with the law, or with the judge, that will save the
   malefactor. Believing and regarding the law, might have prevented his
   death; but denying and accusing it will but hasten it. If it were not
   so, a hundred would bring their reason against the law, for one that
   would bring his reason to the law. And men would rather give their
   reasons, why they should not be punished, than to hear the commands and
   reasons of their governors which require them to obey. The law was not
   made for you to judge, but that you might be ruled and judged by it.

   But, if there be any so blind as to venture to question either the
   truth or the justice of this law of God, I shall briefly give you that
   evidence of both, which methinks should satisfy a reasonable man.

   And first, if you doubt whether this be the word of God or not, besides
   a hundred other texts, you may be satisfied by these few.--Matt. xviii.
   5. "Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted and become as little
   children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven."--John iii. 3.
   "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born again he cannot
   see the kingdom of God."--2 Cor. v. 17. "If any man be in Christ, he is
   a new creature; old things are passed away, behold, all things are
   become new."--Col. iii. 9, 10. "Ye have put off the old man with his
   deeds, and have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge,
   after the image of him that created him."--Heb. xii. 14. "Without
   holiness no man shall see God."--Rom. viii. 8, 9. "So, then they that
   are in the flesh cannot please God."--"Now if any man have not the
   spirit of Christ, he is none of his."--Gal. vi. 45. "For in Christ
   Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision, but a
   new creature."--1 Pet. i. 3. "According to his abundant grace he hath
   begotten us to a lively hope."--Verse 23. "Being born again not of
   corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which
   liveth and abideth for ever."--1 Pet. ii. 1, 2. "Wherefore laying aside
   malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and evil speaking:
   as new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow
   thereby."--Psal. ix. 17. "The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all
   the nations that forget God."--Psal. xi. 5. "And the Lord loveth the
   righteous, but the wicked his soul hateth."

   As I need not stay to open these texts, which are so plain, so I think
   I need not add any more of that multitude which speak the like. If thou
   be a man that dost believe the word of God, here is already enough to
   satisfy thee, that the wicked must be converted or condemned. You are
   already brought so far, that you must either confess that this is true,
   or say plainly you will not believe the word of God. And, if once you
   come to that pass, there are but small hopes of you: look to yourselves
   as well as you can, for, it is likely you will not be long out of hell.
   You would be ready to fly in the face of him that should give you the
   lie; and yet dare you give the lie to God? But if you tell God plainly
   you will not believe him, blame him not if he never warn you more, or
   if he forsake you, and give you up as hopeless. For to what purpose
   should he warn you, if you will not believe him? Should he send an
   angel from heaven to you, it seems you would not believe. For an angel
   can speak but the word of God; and, if an angel should bring you any
   other gospel, you are not to receive it, but to hold him accursed (Gal.
   i. 8). And surely there is no angel to be believed before the Son of
   God, who came from the Father to bring us this doctrine. If he be not
   to be believed, then all the angels in heaven are not to be believed.
   And if you stand on these terms with God, I shall leave you till he
   deal with you in a more convincing way. God hath a voice that will make
   you hear. Though he intreat you to hear the voice of his gospel, he
   will make you hear the voice of his condemning sentence, without
   intreaty. We cannot make you believe against your will; but God will
   make you feel against your will.

   But let us hear what reason you have, why you will not believe this
   word of God, which tells us that the wicked must be converted or
   condemned. I know your reason; it is because that you judge it unlikely
   that God should be so unmerciful: you think it cruelty to damn men
   everlastingly for so small a thing as a sinful life. And this leads us
   to the second thing, which is, to justify the equity of God in his laws
   and judgments.

   And first, I think you will not deny but that it is most suitable to an
   immortal soul to be ruled by laws that promise an eternal reward and
   threaten an endless punishment. Otherwise the law should not be suited
   to the nature of the subject, who will not be fully ruled by any lower
   means than the hopes or fears of everlasting things: As it is in case
   of temporal punishment; if a law were now made, that the most heinous
   crimes shall be punished with a hundred years captivity, this might be
   of some efficacy, as being equal to our lives. But, if there had been
   no other penalties before the flood, when men lived eight or nine
   hundred years, it would not have been sufficient, because men would
   know that they might have so many hundred years impunity afterwards. So
   it is in the present case.

   2. I suppose that you will confess, that the promise of an endless and
   inconceivable glory is not so unsuitable to the wisdom of God, or the
   case of man. And why then should you not think so of the threatening of
   an endless and unspeakable misery?

   3. When you find it in the word of God that so it is, and so it will
   be, do you think yourselves fit to contradict this word?--Will you call
   your Maker to the bar, and examine his word upon the accusation or
   falsehood? Will you set upon him, and judge him by the law of your
   conceits? Are you wiser, and better, and more righteous than he? Must
   the God of heaven come to you to learn wisdom? Must infinite wisdom
   learn of folly? and infinite Holiness be corrected by a selfish sinner
   that cannot keep himself an hour clean? Must the Almighty stand at the
   bar of a worm? O! horrid arrogance of senseless dust! Shall every mole,
   or clod, or dunghill, accuse the sun of darkness, and undertake to
   illuminate the world? Where were you when the Almighty made these laws,
   that he did not call you to his counsel? Surely he made them before you
   were born, without desiring your advice! and you came into the world
   too late to reverse them. If you could have done so great a work, you
   should have stepped out of your nothingness, and have contradicted
   Christ when he was on earth, or Moses before him, or have saved Adam
   and his sinful progeny from the threatened death, that so there might
   have been no need of Christ! And what if God withdraw his patience and
   sustenation, and let you drop into hell while you are quarrelling with
   his word?--Will you then believe that there is no hell?

   4. If sin be such an evil that it requires the death of Christ for its
   expiation, no wonder if it deserve our everlasting misery.

   5. And if the sin of the devils deserved an endless torment, why not
   also the sin of man?

   6. And methinks you should perceive, that it is not possible for the
   best of men, much less for the wicked, to be competent judges of the
   desert of sin. Alas! We are both blind and partial. You can never know
   fully the desert of sin till you fully know, the evil of sin: and you
   can never fully know the evil of sin till you fully know, 1 The
   excellency of the soul, which it deformeth: 2. And the excellency of
   holiness, which it doth obliterate: 3. And the reason and excellency of
   the glory, which it violateth: And 4. the excellency of the glory which
   it doth despise: And, 5. the excellency and office of reason, which it
   treadeth down: 6. No, nor till you know the infinite excellency,
   almightiness and holiness, of that God, against whom it is committed.
   When you fully know all these, you shall fully know the desert of sin.
   Besides, you know that the offender is too partial to judge the law or
   the proceedings of the judge. We judge by feeling, which blinds our
   reason. We see, in common worldly things, that most men think the cause
   is right which is their own; and that all is wrong that is done against
   them; and let the most wise, or just impartial friends persuade them to
   the contrary, and it is all in vain. There are few children but think
   the father is unmerciful, or dealeth hardly with them, if he whip them.
   There is scarce the vilest wretch, but thinketh the church doth wrong
   him, if they excommunicate him; or scarce a thief or murderer that is
   hanged, but would accuse the law and judge of cruelty, if that would
   serve his turn.

   7. Can you think that an unholy soul is fit for heaven? Alas! they
   cannot love God there, nor do him any service which he can accept. They
   are contrary to God; they loathe that which he most loveth; and love
   that which he abhoreth: they are incapable of that imperfect communion
   with him; which his saints do here partake of. How then can they live
   in that perfect love of him, and full delight and communion with him,
   which is the blessedness of heaven? You do not accuse yourselves of
   unmercifulness, if you make not your enemy your bosom counsellor; and
   yet you will blame the absolute Lord, the most wise and gracious
   Sovereign of the world, if he condemn the unconverted to perpetual
   misery.

   USE.

   I beseech you now, all that love your souls, that instead of
   quarrelling with God, and with his word, you will presently stoop to
   it, and use it for good. All you that are unconverted in this assembly,
   take this as the undoubted truth of God; you must ere long be converted
   or condemned; there is no other way, but to turn or die. When God that
   cannot lie hath told you this; when you hear it from the Maker and
   Judge of the world, it is time for him that hath ears to hear. By this
   time you may see what you have to trust to. You are but dead and damned
   men, except you will be converted. Should I tell you otherwise, I
   should deceive you with a lie.--Should I hide this from you, I should
   undo you, and be guilty of your blood, as the verses before my text
   assure me: ver. 8. "When I say to the wicked, O wicked man, you shalt
   surely die, if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way,
   that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require
   at thy hand."--You see then, though this be a rough and unwelcome
   doctrine, it is such as we must preach, and you must hear. It is easier
   to hear of hell than feel it. If your necessities did not require it,
   we would not gall your tender ears with truths that seem so harsh and
   grievous. Hell would not be so full, if people were but willing to know
   their case, and to hear and think of it. The reason why so few escape
   it is, because they strive not to enter in at the strait gate of
   conversion, and go the narrow way of holiness while they have time; and
   they strive not, because they are not awakened to a lively feeling of
   the danger they are in; and they are not awakened, because they are
   loathe to hear or think of it, and that is partly through foolish
   tenderness and carnal self-love, and partly because they do not well
   believe the word that threateneth it.--If you will not thoroughly
   believe this truth, methinks the weight of it should force you to
   remember it; and it should follow you, and give you no rest, till you
   are converted. If you had but once heard this word, by the voice of an
   angel, "Thou must be converted, or condemned; turn, or die" would it
   not stick in your mind, and haunt you night and day, so that in your
   sinning you would remember it, as if the voice were still in your ears,
   "turn, or die!" O happy were your souls if it might thus work with you,
   and never be forgotten or let you alone till it have driven home your
   heart to God. But if you will cast it out by forgetfulness or unbelief,
   how can it work to your conversion and salvation? But take this with
   you to your sorrow, though you may put this out of your minds, you
   cannot put it out of the Bible; but there it will stand as a settled
   truth, which you shall experimentally know forever, that there is no
   other way but, turn, or die.

   O what is the matter then, that the hearts of sinners be not pierced
   with such a weighty truth! A man would think now, that every
   unconverted soul that hears these words should be pricked to the heart,
   and think with themselves, this is my own case, and never be quiet till
   they found themselves converted.--Believe it, Sirs, this drowsy
   careless temper will not last long. Conversion and condemnation are
   both of them awakening things. I can foretel it as truly as if I saw it
   with my eyes, that either grace or hell will shortly bring these
   matters to the quick, and make you say, "What have I done? what a
   foolish wicked course have I taken?" The scornful and the stupid state
   of sinners, will last but a little while, As soon as they either turn
   or die, the presumptuous dream will be at an end, and then their wits
   and feeling will return.

   But I foresee there are two things that are likely to harden the
   unconverted, and make me lose all my labour, except they can be taken
   out of the way: and that is, the misunderstanding on those two words:
   [the wicked] and [turn.] Some will think to themselves, it is true, the
   wicked must turn or die; but what is that to me? I am not wicked,
   though I am a sinner, as all men are. Others will think, "it is true
   that we must turn from our evil ways; but I am turned long ago: I hope
   this is not now to do." And thus, while wicked men think they are not
   wicked, but are already converted, we lose all our labour in persuading
   them to turn. I shall therefore, before I go any farther, tell you here
   who are meant by the wicked, and who they are that must turn or die;
   and also what is meant by turning, and who they are that are truly
   converted. And this I have purposely reserved for this place,
   preferring the method that fits my end.

   And here you may observe, that, in the sense of the text, a wicked man
   and a converted man are contraries. No man is a wicked man that is
   converted, and no man is a converted man that is wicked; so that to be
   a wicked man, and to be an unconverted man, is all one. And therefore
   in opening one, we shall open both.

   Before I can tell you what either wickedness or conversion is, I must
   go to the bottom, and fetch up the matter from the beginning.

   It pleased the great Creator of the world to make three sorts of living
   creatures.--Angels he made pure spirits, without flesh, and therefore
   he made them only for heaven, and not to dwell on earth. Beasts were
   made flesh, without immortal souls, and therefore they were made only
   for the earth, and not for heaven: Man is of a middle nature between
   both, as partaking of both flesh and spirit, so is he made for earth,
   but as his passage or way to heaven, and not that this should be his
   home or happiness. The blessed state that man was made for was to
   behold the glorious majesty of the Lord, and to praise him among his
   holy angels; and to love him, and to be filled with his love forever.
   And as this was the end that man was made for, so God did give him
   means that were fitted to the attaining of it. These means were
   principally two: First, the right disposition of the mind of man;
   Secondly, the right ordering of his life. For the first, God suited the
   disposition of man unto the end; giving him such knowledge of God as
   was fit for his present state, and a heart inclined to God in holy
   love. But yet he did not fix or confirm him in this condition; but,
   having made him a free agent, he left him in the hands of his own free
   will. For the second, God did that which belongeth to him: that is, he
   gave man a perfect law, requiring him to continue in the love of God,
   and perfectly to obey him. By the wilful breach of this law, man did
   not only forfeit his hopes of everlasting life, but also turned his
   heart from God, and fixed it on these lower fleshly things, and hereby
   did blot out our spiritual image of God, from the soul: So that man did
   both fall short of the glory of God, which was his end, and put himself
   out of the way by which he should have attained it; and this both as to
   the frame of his heart, and of his life. The holy inclination and love
   of his soul to God, he lost, and instead of it, he contracted an
   inclination and love to the pleasing of his flesh, or carnal self, by
   earthly things; growing strange to God, and acquainted with the
   creature: and the course of this life was suited to the inclination of
   his heart; he lived to his carnal self, and not to God, he sought the
   creature, for the pleasing of his flesh, instead of seeking to please
   the Lord. With this nature, or corrupt inclination, we are all now born
   into the world; for, "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?"
   Job xiv. 4. As a lion hath a fierce and cruel nature before it doth
   devour; and an adder hath a venomous nature before she sting; so in our
   infancy we have those sinful natures, or inclinations, before we think,
   or speak, or do amiss: and hence springeth all the sin of our lives.
   And not only so, but when God hath of his mercy provided us a remedy,
   even the Lord Jesus Christ to be the Saviour of our souls, and bring us
   back to God again, we naturally love our present state, and are loathe
   to be brought out of it, and therefore are set against the means of our
   recovery. And, though custom have taught us to thank Christ for his
   good will, yet carnal self persuadeth us to refuse his remedies, and to
   desire to be excused when we are commanded to take the medicines which
   he offereth, and are called to forsake all and follow him to God and
   glory.

   I pray you read over this leaf again, and mark it: for in these few
   words you have a true description of our natural state, and
   consequently of a wicked man. For every man that is in this state of
   corrupted nature is a wicked man, and in a state of death.

   By this also you are prepared to understand what it is to be converted;
   to which end you must farther know, that the mercy of God, not willing
   that man should perish in his sin, provided a remedy, by causing his
   Son to take our nature, and being in one person God and man, to become
   a mediator between God and man; and, by dying for our sins on the
   cross, to ransom us from the curse of God and the power of the devil:
   and, having thus redeemed us, the Father has delivered us into his
   hands as his own. Hereupon the Father and the Mediator do make a new
   law and covenant for man: not like the first, which gave life to none
   but the perfectly obedient, and condemned man for every sin; but Christ
   hath made a law of grace, or a promise of pardon and everlasting life
   to all, that, by true repentance and by faith in Christ, are converted
   unto God. Like an act of oblivion which is made by a prince to a
   company of rebels, on condition they lay down their arms and come in,
   and be loyal subjects for the time to come.

   But, because the Lord knoweth that the heart of man is grown so wicked,
   that for all this men will not accept of the remedy, if they be left to
   themselves; therefore that Holy Ghost hath undertaken it as his office,
   to inspire the apostles, and seal up the scriptures by miracles and
   wonders, and to illuminate and convert the sons of the elect.

   So that by this much you see, that the Father, the Son, and the Holy
   Ghost, have each their several works, which are eminently ascribed to
   them.

   The Father's works were to create us, to rule us as his rational
   creatures, by the law of nature, and judge us thereby, and in mercy to
   provide us a Redeemer, when we were lost, and to send his Son, and
   accept his ransom.

   The works of the Son for us were these; to ransom and redeem us by his
   sufferings and righteousness, to give out the promise or law of grace,
   and rule and judge the world as their Redeemer, on terms of grace, and
   to make intercession for us, that the benefit of his death may be
   communicated; and to send the Holy Ghost, which the Father also doth by
   the Son. The works of the Holy Ghost for us are these; to indite the
   holy scriptures, by inspiring and guiding the prophets and apostles,
   and sealing the word by his miraculous gifts and works; and the
   illuminating and exciting the ordinary ministers of the gospel, and so
   enabling them and helping them to publish that word; and, by the same
   word, illuminating and converting the souls of men. So that, as you
   could not have been reasonable creatures if the Father had not created
   you; nor have had any access to God if the Son had not redeemed you; so
   neither can you have a part in Christ, or be saved, except the Holy
   Ghost do sanctify you.

   So that by this time you may see the several causes of this work:-- The
   Father sendeth his Son: the Son redeemeth us, and maketh the promise of
   grace; the Holy Ghost inditeth and sealeth this gospel; the apostles
   are the secretaries of the Spirit to write it; the preachers of the
   gospel to proclaim it, and persuade men to obey it; and the Holy Ghost
   doth make their preaching effectual, by opening the hearts of men to
   entertain it; and all this to repair the image of God upon the soul,
   and to set the heart upon God again, and take it off the creature and
   carnal self to which it is revolted, and so turn the current of the
   life into a heavenly course, which before was earthly, and all this by
   the entertainment of Christ by Faith, who is the physician of the soul.

   By what I have said, you may see what it is to be wicked, and what it
   is to be converted; which I think will yet be plainer to you, if I
   describe them as consisting of their several parts; and, for the first,
   a wicked man may be known by these three things.

   First, he is one who places his chief content on earth, and loveth the
   creature more than God, and his fleshly prosperity above the heavenly
   felicity: He favoureth the things of the flesh, but neither discerneth
   nor savoureth the things of the spirit:--Though he will say, that
   heaven is better than earth, yet doth not really so esteem it to
   himself; if he might be sure of earth, he would let go heaven, and had
   rather stay here than be removed thither. A life of perfect holiness,
   in the sight of God, and in his love and praise for ever in heaven,
   doth not find such liking, with his heart, as a life of health, and
   wealth, and honour, here upon earth. And though he falsely profess that
   he loveth God above all, yet indeed he never felt the power of divine
   love within him, but his mind is more set on the world, or fleshly
   pleasures than on God. In a word, whoever loveth earth above heaven,
   and fleshly prosperity more than God, is a wicked unconverted man.

   On the other hand, a converted man is illuminated to discern the
   loveliness of God; and so far believeth the glory that is to be had
   with God, that his heart is taken up to it, and set more upon it, than
   any thing in this world. He had rather see the face of God, and live in
   his everlasting love and praises, than have all the wealth or pleasures
   of the world; he seeth that all things else are vanity, and nothing but
   God can fill the soul, and therefore, let the world go which way it
   will, he layeth up his treasures and hopes in heaven, and for that he
   resolves to let go all. As the fire doth mount upwards, and the needle
   that is touched with the loadstone still turneth to the north, so the
   converted soul is inclined to God. Nothing else can satisfy him, nor
   can he find any content and rest but in his love. In a word, all that
   are converted do esteem and love God better than all the world; and the
   heavenly felicity is dearer to them than their fleshly prosperity. The
   proof of what I have said you may find in these places of scripture:
   Phil. iii. 18, 21. Matt. vi. 19, 20, 21. Col. iii. 1, 2, 4, 5. Rom.
   viii. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 18, 23. Psal. lxxiii. 25, 26.

   Secondly, a wicked man is one that maketh it the principal business of
   his life to prosper in the world, and attain his fleshly ends. And
   though he may read and hear, and do much in the outward duties of
   religion, and forbear disgraceful sins, yet this is all but the by, and
   he never makes it the principal business of his life to please God, and
   attain everlasting glory, and puts off God with the leavings of the
   world, and gives him no more service than the flesh can spare; for he
   will not part with all for heaven.

   On the contrary, a converted man is one that makes it the principal
   care and business of his life to please God, and to be saved, and takes
   all the blessings of this life but as accommodations in his journey
   towards another life, and useth the creature in subordination to God:
   he loveth a holy life, and longeth to be more holy: he hath no sin but
   what he hateth, and longeth, and prayeth, and striveth to be rid of.
   The drift and bent of his life is for God; and, if he sin, it is
   contrary to the very bent of his heart and life, and therefore he rises
   again and lamenteth it, and dares not wilfully live in any known sin.
   There is nothing in this world so dear to him but he can give it up to
   God, and forsake it for him, and the hopes of glory.--All this you may
   see in Col. iii. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Matt. vi. 20, 33. Luke xviii. 22, 23,
   29. Luke xiv. 18, 24, 26, 27. Rom. viii. 13. Gal. v. 24. Luke xii. 21,
   &c.

   Thirdly, the soul of a wicked man did never truly discern and relish
   the mystery of redemption, nor thankfu1ly entertain an offered Saviour;
   nor is he taken up with the love of the Redeemer, nor willing to be
   ruled by him as the physician of his soul, that he may be saved from
   the guilt and power of his sins, and recovered unto God; but his heart
   is insensible of this unspeakable benefit, and is quite against the
   healing means by which he should be recovered. Though he may be willing
   to be carnally religious, yet he never resigneth up his soul to Christ,
   and to the motion and conduct of his word and spirit.

   On the contrary, the converted soul having felt himself undone by sin,
   and perceiving that he hath lost his peace with God, and hopes of
   heaven, and is in danger of everlasting misery, doth thankfully
   entertain the tidings of redemption, and, believing in the Lord Jesus
   as his only Saviour, resigneth up himself to him for wisdom,
   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; he taketh Christ as the
   life of his soul, and liveth by him, and useth him as a salve for every
   sore, admiring the wisdom and love of God in this wonderful work of
   man's redemption. In a word, Christ doth even dwell in his heart by
   faith, and the life that he now liveth is by the faith of the Son of
   God, that he hath loved him, and gave himself for him; yea, it is not
   so much he that liveth, as Christ in him. For these, see Job i. 11, 12,
   and iii. 20. John xv. 2, 3, 4. 1 Cor. i. 20, and ii. 2.

   You see now in plain terms, from the word of God, who are the wicked
   and who are the converted. Ignorant people think that if a man be no
   swearer, nor curser, nor railer, nor drunkard, nor fornicator, nor
   extortioner, nor wrong any body in their dealings, and if they come to
   church, and say their prayers, receive the sacrament, and sometimes
   extend their hands to the relief of the poor, these cannot be
   unconverted men. Or if a man, that hath been guilty of drunkenness, or
   swearing, or gaming, or the like vices, do but forbear them for the
   time to come, they think that this is a converted man.--Others think,
   if a man, that hath been an enemy and scorner at godliness, do but
   approve it, and join himself with those that are godly, and be hated
   for it by the wicked, as the godly are, that this must needs be a
   converted man. And some are so foolish as to think that they are
   converted by taking up some new opinion. And some think, if they have
   but been affrighted by the fears of hell, and had conviction and
   tortures of conscience, and thereupon have purposed and promised
   amendment, and take up a life of civil behaviour and outward religion,
   that this must needs be true conversion. And these are the poor deluded
   souls that are like to lose the benefit of all our persuasions; and,
   when they hear that the wicked must turn or die, they think that this
   is not spoken to them; for they are not wicked, but are turned already.
   And therefore it is that Christ told some of the rulers of the Jews who
   were graver and civiler than the common people, that "publicans and
   harlots go into the kingdom of Christ before them," Matt. xxi. 31. Not
   that a harlot or gross sinner can be saved without conversion, but
   because it was easier to make these gross sinners perceive their sin
   and misery, and the necessity of a change, than the civiler sort delude
   themselves by thinking that they are converted already, when they are
   not.

   O sirs, conversion is another kind of work than most are aware of; it
   is not a small matter to bring an earthly mind to heaven, and to shew
   man the amiable excellencies of God, till he be taken up in such love
   to him, that can never be quenched; to break the heart for sin, and
   make him fly for refuge to Christ, and thankfully embrace him as the
   life of his soul; to have the very drift and bent of the heart and life
   changed; so that a man renounceth that which he took for felicity, and
   placeth his felicity where he never did before, and liveth not to the
   same end, and driveth not on the same design in the world, as he
   formerly did: in a word, he that is in Christ is a new creature: "old
   things are passed away, behold, all things are become new." (2 Cor. v.
   17). He hath a new understanding, a new will and resolution, new
   sorrows, and desires, and love, and delight: new thoughts, new
   speeches, new company, (if possible) and new conversation. Sin, that
   was before a jesting matter with him, is now so odious and terrible to
   him, that he flies from it as from death. The world, that was so lovely
   in his eyes, doth now appear but as vanity and vexation: God, that was
   before neglected, is now the only happiness of his soul; before he was
   forgotten, and every lust preferred before him: but now he is set next
   the heart, and all things must give place to him, and the heart is
   taken up in the attendance and observance of him, and is grieved when
   be hides his face, and never thinks itself well without him. Christ
   himself, that was wont to be slightly thought of, is now his only hope
   and refuge, and he liveth upon him as on his daily bread; he cannot
   pray without him, nor rejoice without him, nor think, nor speak, nor
   live without him.--Heaven itself, that before was looked upon but as a
   tolerable reserve which he hoped might serve his turn better than hell,
   when he could not stay any longer in the world, is now taken for his
   home, the place of his only hope and rest, where he shall see, and
   love, and praise that God that hath his heart already. Hell, that
   before did seem but as a bug bear to frighten men from sin, doth now
   appear to be a real misery, that is not to be ventured on, nor jested
   with.--The works of holiness, which before he was weary of, and seemed
   to be more ado than needs, are now both his recreation, and his
   business, and the trade that he lives upon. The Bible, which was before
   to him but almost as a common book, is now as the law of God, as a
   letter written to him from heaven, and subscribed with the name or the
   eternal Majesty; it is the rule of his thoughts, and words, and deeds;
   the commands are binding, the threats are dreadful, and the promises of
   it speak life to his soul. The godly, that seemed to him but like other
   men, are now the excellentest and happiest on earth. And the wicked
   that were his play-fellows, are now his grief; and he, that could laugh
   at their sins, is readier now to weep for their sin and misery, Psalm
   xvi. 3. and xv. 4. Phil. iii. 18. In short, he hath a new end in his
   thoughts, and a new way in his endeavours, and therefore his heart and
   life are new. Before, his carnal self was his end; and his pleasure and
   worldly profits, and credit were his way; and now God and everlasting
   glory are his end; and Christ, and the spirit, and word, and
   ordinances, holiness to God, and righteousness, and mercy to men, these
   are his way. Before, self was the chiefest ruler; to which the matters
   of God and conscience must stoop and give place. And now God in Christ,
   by the spirit, word and ministry, is that chief ruler, to whom both
   self and all the matters of self must give place. So that this is not a
   change in one, or two, or twenty points, but in the whole soul, and in
   the very end and bent of the conversation. A man may step out of one
   path into another, and yet have his face the same way, and be still
   going towards the same place: But it is another matter to turn quite
   back again, and take his journey the contrary way, to a contrary place.
   So it is here: a man may turn from drunkenness to thriftiness, and
   forsake his good fellowship, and other gross disgraceful sins, and set
   upon some duties of religion, and yet be still going to the same end as
   before, intending his carnal self above all, and giving it still the
   government of his soul. But, when he is converted, this self is denied
   and taken down, and God is set up, and his face is turned the contrary
   way; and he, that before was addicted to himself, and lived to himself,
   is now by sanctification devoted to God, and liveth unto God. Before,
   he asked himself what he should do with his time, his parts, and his
   estate, and for himself he used them; but now he asketh God what he
   shall do with them, and useth them for him. Before, he would please God
   so far as might stand with the pleasure of his flesh and carnal self,
   but not to any great displeasure of them. But now he will please God,
   let flesh and self be ever so much displeased. This is the great change
   that God will make upon all that shall be saved.

   You can say, that the Holy Ghost is our sanctifier; but do you know
   what sanctification is? Why, this is that I have now opened to you; and
   every man and woman in the world must have this, or be condemned to
   everlasting misery. They must turn or die.

   Do you believe all this, or do you not? Surely you dare not say, you do
   not; for it is past a doubt or denial. These are not controversies,
   where one learned pious man is of one mind, and another of another;
   where one party saith this, and another saith that; every denomination
   among us that deserve to be called Christians are all agreed in this
   that I have said; and, if you will not believe the God of truth, and
   that in a case where every party do believe him, you are utterly
   inexcusable.

   But, if you do believe this, how comes it to pass that you live so
   quietly in an unconverted state? Do you know that you are converted?
   and can you find this wonderful change upon your souls? Have you been
   thus born again, and made anew?--Are not these strange matters to many
   of you? and such as you never felt upon yourselves? If you cannot tell
   the day or week of your change, or the very sermon, that converted you,
   yet, do you find that the work is done; that such a change indeed there
   is, and that you have such hearts as before described? Alas! The most
   do follow their worldly business, and little trouble their minds with
   such thoughts: and, if they be but restrained from scandalous sins, and
   can say, "I am no whoremonger, nor thief, nor curser, nor swearer, nor
   tipler, nor extortioner; I go to church, and say my prayers;" they
   think that this is true conversion, and they shall be saved as well as
   any. Alas, this is foolish cheating of yourselves; this is too much
   contempt of an endless glory, and too gross neglect of your immortal
   souls.--Can you make so light of heaven and hell? Your corpse will
   shortly lie in the dust, and angels or devils will presently seize upon
   your souls, and every man and woman of you all will shortly be among
   other company, and in another case than now you are; you will dwell in
   those houses but a little longer, you will work in your shops but a
   little longer; you will sit in these seats, and dwell on this earth,
   but a little longer; you will see with those eyes, and hear with those
   ears, and speak with those tongues, but a little longer; till the
   resurrection day: and can you make shift to forget this? O what a place
   will you be shortly in of joy or torment! O what a sight will you
   shortly see in heaven or hell! O what thoughts will shortly fill your
   hearts with unspeakable delight or horror! What work will you be
   employed in; to praise the Lord with saints and angels, or to cry out
   in fire unquenchable with devils! And should all this be forgotten? And
   all this will be endless, and sealed up by an unchangeable decree;
   ETERNITY, ETERNITY will be the measure of your joys or sorrows: And can
   this be forgotten? And all this is true, most certainly true.--When you
   have gone up and down a little longer, and slept and awaked a few times
   more, you will be dead and gone, and find all true that now I tell you.
   And yet can you now so much forget it? You shall then remember that you
   heard this sermon, and that this day, from this place, you were
   reminded of these things; and perceive them matters a thousand times
   greater than either you or I could have conceived; and yet shall they
   now be so much forgotten?

   Beloved friends, if the Lord had not awakened me to believe and to lay
   to heart these things myself, I should have remained in a dark and
   selfish state, and have perished for ever: but, if he have truly made
   me sensible of them, it will constrain me to compassionate you as well
   as myself. If your eyes were so far opened as to see hell, and you saw
   your neighbours, that were unconverted, dragged thither with hideous
   cries, though they were such as you accounted honest people on earth,
   and feared no such matter by themselves, such a sight would make you go
   home and think of it; and think again, and make you warn all about you
   as that damned worldling in Luke xvi. 28. would have had his brethren
   warned, lest they come to that place of torment. Why, faith is a kind
   of sight; it is the eye of the soul, the evidence of things not seen.
   If 1 believe God, it is next to seeing; and therefore I beseech you
   excuse me, if I be half as earnest with you about these matters as if I
   had seen them. If I must die to-morrow, and it were in my power to come
   again from another world, and tell you what I had seen, would you not
   be willing to hear me? and would you not believe and regard what I
   should tell you? If I might preach one sermon to you after I am dead,
   and have seen what is done in the world to come, would you not have me
   plainly speak the truth and would you not crowd to hear me? and would
   you not lay it to heart? But this must not be; God hath his appointed
   way of teaching you by scripture and ministers, and he will not humour
   unbelievers so far as to send men from the dead to them, and to alter
   his established way. If any man quarrel with the sun, God will not
   humour him so far as to set up a clearer light. Friends, I beseech you,
   regard me now as you would do if I should come from the dead to you;
   for, I can give you as full assurance of the truth of what I say to you
   as if I had been there and seen it with my eyes: For, it is possible
   for one from the dead to deceive you; but Jesus Christ can never
   deceive you: but Jesus Christ can never deceive you.--The word of God.
   delivered in scripture, and sealed by the miracles and holy workings of
   the Spirit, can never deceive you. Believe this, or believe nothing.
   Believe and obey this, or you are undone. Now, as ever you believe the
   word of God, and as ever you care for the salvation of your souls, let
   me beg of you this reasonable request; and I beseech yon deny me not:
   that you would, without any more delay, when you are gone from hence,
   remember what you heard, and enter into an earnest search of your
   hearts, and say to yourselves, "Is it so indeed? Must I turn or die?
   Must I be converted or condemned? It is time for me then to look about
   me, before it be too late. O why did not I look after this till now?
   Why did I venturously post off so great a business? Was I awake, or in
   my wits? O blessed God, what a mercy is it that thou didst not cut off
   my life all this while, before I had any certain hope of eternal
   life!--Well, God forbid that I should neglect this work any longer.
   What state is my soul in? Am I converted, or am I not? Was ever such a
   change or work done upon my soul? Have I been illuminated by the word
   and spirit of the Lord to see the odiousness of sin, the need of a
   Saviour, the love of Christ, and the excellencies of God and glory? Is
   my heart broken or humbled within me for my former life? Have I
   thankfully entertained my Saviour and Lord that offered himself with
   pardon and life for my soul? Do I hate my former sinful life, and the
   remnant of every sin that is in me? Do I fly from them as my deadly
   enemies? Do I give up myself to a life of holiness and obedience to
   God? Do I love and delight in it? Can I truly say that I am dead to the
   world and carnal self, and that I live for God, and the glory which he
   hath promised? Hath heaven more of my estimation and resolution than
   earth? and is God the dearest and highest in my soul? Once, I am sure,
   I lived principally to the world and flesh, and God had nothing but
   some heartless services which the world could spare, and which were the
   leavings of the flesh.--Is my heart now turned another way? Have I a
   new design, and a new end, and a new train of holy affections? Have I
   set my hopes and heart in heaven? And is it not the scope, and design,
   and bent of my heart and life, to get well to heaven, and see the
   glorious face of God, and live in his everlasting love and praise? And
   when I sin, is it against the habitual bent and design of my heart? And
   do I conquer all gross sins, and am I weary and willing to be rid of
   mine infirmities? This is the state of a converted soul, and thus it
   must be with me, or I must perish. Is it thus indeed with me, or is it
   not? It is time to get this doubt resolved, before the dreadful judge
   resolve it. I am not such a stranger to my own heart and life, but I
   may somewhat perceive whether I am thus converted or not: if I be not,
   it will do me no good to flatter my soul with false conceits and hopes.
   I am resolved no more to deceive myself, but endeavour to know truly,
   off or on, whether I be converted, yea or no: that, if I be, I may
   rejoice in it; and glorify my gracious Lord, and comfortably go on till
   I reach the crown: And If I am not, I may set myself to beg and seek
   after the grace that should convert me, and may turn without any more
   delay:--For, if I find in time that I am out of the way, by the help of
   Christ I may turn and be recovered; but, if I stay till either my heart
   be forsaken of God, in blindness or hardness, or till I be caught away
   by death, it is then too late. There is no place for repentance and
   conversion then: I know it must be now or never."

   Sirs, this is my request to you, that you will but take your hearts to
   task, and thus examine them, till you see, if it may be, whether you
   are converted or not; and, if you cannot find it out by your own
   endeavours, go to your ministers, if they be faithful and experienced
   men, and desire their assistance. The matter is great, let not
   bashfulness, nor carelessness hinder you. They are set over you to
   advise you, for the saving of your soul, as physicians advise you for
   the curing of your bodies. It undoes many thousands, that they think
   they are in the way to salvation when they are not; and thinking that
   they are converted, when it is no such thing. And then, when we call to
   them to turn, they go away as they came, and think that this concerns
   not them; for they are turned already, and hope they shall do well
   enough in the way that they are in; at least if they do but pick the
   fairest path, and avoid some of the foulest steps; when, alas! all this
   while they live but to the world and flesh, and are strangers to God
   and eternal life, and are quite out of the way to heaven. And all this
   is much, because we cannot persuade them to a few serious thoughts of
   their condition, and to spend a few hours in the examining of their
   states. Is there not many a self-deceiving wretch that hears me this
   day, that never bestowed one hour in all their lives to examine their
   souls, and try whether they are truly converted or not?--O merciful
   God, that will care for such wretches as care no more for themselves,
   and that will do so much to save them from hell, and help them to
   heaven, who will do so little for it themselves! If all that are in the
   way to hell did but know it, they durst not continue in it. The
   greatest hope that the devil hath of bringing you to damnation without
   a rescue, is by keeping you blind-fold and ignorant of your state, and
   making you believe that you may do well enough in the way that you are
   in. If you knew that you were out of the way to heaven, and were lost
   forever if you should die as you are; durst you sleep another night in
   the state that you are in? durst you live another day in it? Could you
   heartily laugh or be merry in such a state? What! and not know but you
   may be snatched away to hell in an hour! Sure it would constrain you to
   forsake your former company and course and to betake yourselves to the
   ways of holiness and the communion of saints: Sure it would drive you
   to cry to God for a new heart, and to seek help of those that are fit
   to counsel you. There is none of you sure that cares not for being
   damned. Well then, I beseech you presently make inquiry into your
   hearts, and give them no rest till you find out your condition; that,
   if it be good, you may rejoice in it, and go on; and, if it be bad, you
   may presently look about you for recovery, as men that believe they
   must turn or die. What say you, Sirs? Will you resolve, and promise, to
   be at thus much labour for your own souls? Will you fall upon this
   self-examination when you get home? Is my request unreasonable? Your
   consciences know it is not.--Resolve on it, then, before you stir;
   knowing how much it concerneth your souls. I beseech you, for the sake
   of that God that doth command you, at whose bar you will shortly all
   appear, that you do not deny me this reasonable request: for the sake
   of souls that must turn or die, I beseech you deny me not; even but to
   make it your business to understand your own conditions, and build upon
   sure ground, and know, off and on, whether you are converted or not,
   and venture not your souls on negligent security.

SERMON II.

   Ezek. xxxiii. 11.

   Say to them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
   death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.
   Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways, for, why will ye die, O house of
   Israel?

   A TRUE description of those who are in a converted state has already
   been given you; the change which conversion makes in the soul has also
   been described; and the request is most earnestly repeated to you,
   impartially and thoroughly to consider your condition: Rest not
   satisfied, till you know whether you are indeed converted.

   But perhaps you will say, what if we should find ourselves yet
   unconverted, what shall we do then?--This question leadeth me to my
   second doctrine, which will do much to the answering of it, to which I
   now proceed.

   Doct. 2. It is the promise of God, that the wicked shall live, if they
   will but turn; unfeignedly and thoroughly turn.

   The Lord here professeth that this is what he takes pleasure in, that
   the wicked turn and live. Heaven is made as sure to the converted, as
   hell is to the unconverted. Turn and live is as certain a truth as turn
   or die. God was not bound to provide us a Saviour, nor open to us a
   door of hope, nor call us to repent and turn when once we had cast
   ourselves away by sin, but he hath freely done it to magnify his mercy.
   Sinners, there are none of you shall have cause to go home and say I
   preach despair to you. Do we use to shut up the door of mercy against
   you? O that you would not shut it up against yourselves! Do we use to
   tell you that God will have no mercy on you, though you turn and be
   sanctified? When did you ever hear a preacher say such a word? You that
   bark at preachers of the gospel, for desiring to keep you out of hell,
   and say that they preach despair, tell me, if you can, when did you
   ever hear any sober man say, that there is no hope for you, tho' you
   repent and be converted? No, it is the contrary that we proclaim from
   the Lord; and, whoever is born again, and by faith and repentance doth
   become a new creature, shall certainly be saved: And so far are we from
   persuading you to despair of this, that we persuade you not to make any
   doubt of it. It is life, not death, that is the first part of our
   message to you, our commission is to offer salvation, certain
   salvation; a speedy, glorious, everlasting salvation, to everyone of
   you; to the poorest beggar as well as the greatest Lord; to the worst
   of you, even to drunkards, swearers, worldlings, thieves, yea, to the
   despisers and reproachers of the holy way of salvation. We are
   commanded by the Lord our master to offer you a pardon for all that is
   past, if you will but now at last return and live: we are commanded to
   beseech and intreat you to accept the offer and return; to tell you
   what preparations are made by Christ; what mercy stays for you, what
   patience waiteth on you, what thoughts of kindness God hath towards
   you, and how happy, how certainly and unspeakably happy, you may be, if
   you will.--We have indeed also a message of wrath and death, yea, of a
   two-fold wrath and death; but neither of them is our principal message;
   we must tell you of the wrath that is on you already, and the death
   that you are born under, for the breach of the law of works; but this
   is but to shew you the need of mercy, and to provoke you to esteem the
   grace of the Redeemer. And we tell you nothing but the truth, which you
   must know: For, who will seek out for physic, that knows not that he is
   sick? Our telling you of your misery is not it that makes you
   miserable, but drives you out to seek for mercy. It is you that have
   brought this death upon yourselves. We tell you also of another death;
   even remediless and much greater torment, that will fall on those that
   will not be converted. But, as this is true, and must be told you, so
   it is but the last and saddest part of our message. We are first to
   offer you mercy if you will turn; and it is only those that will not
   turn, nor hear the voice of mercy, to whom we must foretel damnation
   to. Will you but cast away your transgressions, delay no longer, but
   come away at the call of Christ, and be converted, and become new
   creatures, and we have not a word of damning wrath or death to speak
   against you.--I do here in the name of the Lord of life, proclaim to
   you, all that hear me this day, to the greatest, the oldest sinner,
   that you may have mercy and salvation, if you will but turn. There is
   mercy in God, there is sufficiency in the satisfaction of Christ, the
   promise is free, and full, and universal; you may have life, if you
   will but turn. But then, as you love your souls, remember what turning
   it is the scripture speaks of. It is not to mend the old house, but to
   pull down all, and build a-new on Christ, the rock and sure foundation.
   It is not to mend somewhat in a carnal course of life, but to mortify
   the flesh, and live after the spirit. It is not to serve the flesh and
   the world, in a more reformed way, without any scandalous disgraceful
   sins, and with a certain kind of religiousness; but it is to change
   your master, and your works, and end, and to set your face the contrary
   way, and do all for the life that you never saw, and dedicate
   yourselves and all you have to God. This is the change that must be
   made, if you will live.

   Yourselves are witnesses now, that it is salvation, and not damnation,
   that is the great doctrine I preach to you, and the first part of my
   message to you. Accept of this, and we shall go no farther with you;
   for we would not so much as affright or trouble you with the name of
   damnation without necessity.

   But if you will not be saved, there is no remedy, but damnation must
   take place; for there is no middle place between the two, you must have
   either life or death.

   And we are not only to offer you life, but to shew you the grounds on
   which we do it; and call you to believe that God doth mean indeed as he
   speaks: that the promise is true, and extendeth conditionally to you,
   as well as others: and that heaven is no fancy, but a true felicity.

   If you ask, Where is your commission for this offer? Among a hundred
   texts of scripture, I will shew it to you in these few:

   First, you see it here in my text, and the following verses, and in the
   18th of Ezekiel, as plain as can be spoken. And in 2 Cor. v. 17, 18,
   19, 20, 21, you have the very sum of our commission. "If any man be in
   Christ, he is a new creature; old things passed away, behold, all
   things are become new. And all things are from God, who hath reconciled
   us unto himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of
   reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world
   unto himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and hath committed
   unto us the word of reconciliation: now then we are ambassadors for
   Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you, in Christ's
   stead, be ye reconciled unto God; for, he hath made him to be sin for
   us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in
   him." So Mark xvi. 15, 16. "Go ye into all the world, and preach the
   gospel to all creature. He that believeth, (that is with such a
   converting faith as is expressed) and is baptized, shall be saved: but
   he that believeth not shall be damned." And Luke xxiv. 46, 47. "Thus it
   behoved Christ to suffer, and rise from the dead the third day, and
   that repentance, (which is conversion) and remission of sins should be
   preached in his name among all nations." And Acts v. 30, 31. "The God
   of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree: him
   hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to
   give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins." And Acts xiii. 38,
   39. "Be it known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that through
   this name is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; and, by him,
   all that believe are justified from all things, from which you could
   not be justified by the law of Moses." And, lest you think this offer
   is restrained to the Jews, see Gal. vi. 15. "For in Christ Jesus
   neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new
   creature." And Luke xiv. 17. "Come, for all things are now ready." and
   ver. 23, 24.

   You see by this time that we are commanded to offer life to you all,
   and to tell you, from God, that if you will turn, you may live.

   Here you may safely trust your souls; for the love of God is the
   fountain of this offer, John iii. 16. and the blood of the Son of God
   hath purchased it: The faithfulness and truth of God are engaged to
   make the promise good; miracles have sealed up the truth of it;
   preachers are sent through the world to proclaim it; the sacraments are
   instituted and used for the solemn delivery of the mercy offered to
   them that will accept it; and the spirit doth open the heart to
   entertain it; and is itself the earnest of the full possession: So that
   the truth of it is past controversy, that the worst of you all, and
   every one of you, if you will but be converted, may be saved.

   Indeed, if you will needs believe that you shall be saved without
   conversion, then you believe a falsehood; and, if I should preach that
   to you, I should preach a lie: This were not to believe God, but the
   devil and your own deceitful hearts.--God hath his promise of life, and
   the devil hath his promise of life: God's promise is, "return and
   live:" The devil's promise is, "you shall live, whether you turn or
   not."--The word of God is, as I have shewn you, "Except ye be
   converted, and become as little children, ye cannot enter into the
   kingdom of heaven," Matt. xviii. 3. "Except a man be born again, he
   cannot enter into the kingdom of God," John iii. 3, 5. "Without
   holiness none shall see God," Heb. xii. 14.--The devil's word is, "you
   may be saved without being born again and converted; you may do well
   enough without being holy; God doth but frighten you; he is more
   merciful, than to do as he saith; he will be better to you than his
   word."--And, alas! the greatest part of the world believe this word of
   the devil before the word of God: just as our sin and misery came into
   the world. God saith to our first parents, "if ye eat ye shall die:"
   And the devil contradicted him and said, "Ye shall not die, if you do
   but cry, God have mercy, at last, and give over the acts of sin when
   you can practice it no longer." And this is the word that the world
   believes.--O heinous wickedness, to believe the devil before God!

   And yet that is not the worst; but blasphemously they call this a
   believing and trusting in God, when they put him in the shape of Satan,
   who was a liar from the beginning. And, when they believe that the word
   of God is a lie, they call this a trusting God, and say they believe in
   him, and trust in him for salvation. Where did ever God say, that the
   unregenerate, unconverted, unsanctified, shall be saved? Shew such a
   word in Scripture. I challenge you, if you can. Why this is the devil's
   word, and to believe it is to believe the devil, and the sin that is
   commonly called presumption. And do you call this a believing and
   trusting God? There is every thing in the word of God to comfort and
   strengthen the hearts of the sanctified: but not a word to strengthen
   the hands of wickedness, nor to give men the least hope of being saved,
   though they be never sanctified.

   But, if you will turn, and come into the way of mercy, the mercy of the
   Lord is ready to entertain you. Then trust God for salvation boldly;
   for he is engaged by his word to save you. He will be a father to none
   but his children, and he will save none but those that forsake the
   world, the devil, and the flesh, and come into his family to be members
   of his Son, and have communion with his saints. But, if they will not
   come in, it is long of themselves. His doors are open, he keeps none
   back. He never sent such a message as this to any of you, "It was now
   too late; I will not receive thee though thou be converted."--He might
   have done so, and done you no wrong: But he did not; he doth not to
   this day: He is still ready to receive you, if you were but ready
   unfeignedly, and with all your hearts, to turn. And the fulness of this
   truth will yet more appear in the two following doctrines, which I
   shall therefore next proceed to, before I make any farther application
   of this.

   Doct. 3. God takes pleasure in men's conversion and salvation, but not
   in their death or damnation: He had rather they would turn and live,
   than go on and die.

   I shall first teach you how to understand this, and then clear up the
   truth of it to you.

   And, for the first, you must observe these following things.

   1. A simple willingness, or complacency, is the first act of the will,
   following the simple apprehension of the undertaking, before it
   proceedeth to compare things together. But the choosing act of the will
   is a following act, and supposeth the comparing practical act of the
   understanding. And these two acts may often be carried to contrary
   objects without any fault at all in the person.

   2. An unfeigned willingness may have divers degrees. Some things I am
   so far willing of as that I will do all that lieth in my power to
   accomplish them: and some things I am truly willing another should do,
   when yet I will not do all that ever I am able to procure them, having
   many reasons to dissuade me therefrom, though yet I will do all that
   belongs me to do.

   3. The will of a ruler, as such, is manifested in making and executing
   laws; but the will of a man, in his simple natural capacity, or as
   absolute Lord of his own, is manifested in desiring or resolving of
   events.

   4. A ruler's will, as lawgiver, is first and principally that his laws
   be obeyed, and not at all that the penalty be executed on any, but only
   on supposition that they will not obey his laws. But a ruler's will, as
   judge, supposeth the law already either kept or broken; and therefore
   he resolveth on rewards or punishments accordingly.

   Having given up these necessary distinctions, I shall next apply them
   to the case in hand in these following propositions.

   1. It is in the glass of the word and creatures that in this life we
   must know God; and so, according to the nature of man, we ascribe to
   him understanding and will, removing all the imperfections that we can,
   because we are capable of no higher positive conceptions of him.

   2. And, on the same grounds, we do (with the scripture) distinguish
   between the acts of God's will, as diversified from the respects or the
   objects, though as to God's essence they are all one.

   3. And the bolder, because that, when we speak of Christ, we have the
   more ground for it from human nature.

   4. And thus we say, that the simple complacency, will, or love of God,
   is to all that is naturally or morally good according to the nature and
   degree of its goodness. And so he hath pleasure in the conversion and
   salvation of all, which yet will never come to pass.

   5. And God, a ruler and law-giver of the world, hath so far a practical
   will for their salvation as to make them a free deed of gift of Christ
   and life, and an act of oblivion for all their sin, if so be they will
   not unthankfully reject it, and to command his messengers to offer this
   gift to all the world, and persuade them to accept it. And so he doth
   all that, as a lawgiver or promiser, belongs to him to do for their
   salvation.

   6. But yet he resolveth, as lawgiver, that they that will not turn
   shall die: And, as judge, when their day of grace is past, he will
   execute that decree.

   7. So, that he thus unfeignedly willeth the conversion of those that
   will never be converted; but not as absolute Lord, with the fullest
   efficacious resollution, nor as a thing which he resolveth shall
   undoubtedly come to pass, or would engage all his power to accomplish.
   It is in the power of a prince to set a guard upon a murderer, to see
   that he shall not murder and be hanged: But, if upon good reason he
   forbear this, and do but send to his subjects, and warn and intreat
   them not to be murderers, I hope he may well say, that he would not
   have them murder and be hanged: He takes no pleasure in it, but rather
   that they forbear and live: And, if he do more for some, upon some
   special reason, he is not found to do so by all. The king may well say
   to all the murderers and felons in the land, "I have no pleasure in
   your death, but rather that you would obey my laws and live: But, if
   you will not, I have resolved for all this, that you shall die."--The
   judge may truly say to the thief or murderer, "Alas, man, I have no
   delight in your death: I had rather thou had kept the law and saved thy
   life: but seeing thou hast not, I must condemn thee, or else I should
   be unjust." So, though God have no pleasure in your damnation, and
   therefore calls upon you to return and live; yet he hath pleasure in
   the demonstration of his own justice, and the executing his laws; and
   therefore he has for all this fully resolved, that, if you will not be
   converted, you shall be condemned. If God were so much against the
   death of the wicked as that he were resolved to do all that he can to
   hinder it, then no man should be condemned; whereas Christ telleth you
   that few will be saved. But so far God is against your damnation as
   that he will teach you and warn you, and set before you life and death,
   and offer you your choice, and command his ministers to intreat you not
   to damn yourselves, but accept his mercy, and so to leave you without
   excuse. But, if this will not do, and if still you be unconverted, he
   professeth to you, he is resolved on your damnation, and hath commanded
   us to say to you in his name, ver. 18, "O wicked man, thou shalt surely
   die!" And Christ hath little less than sworn it over and over, with a
   "Verily, verily, except you be converted, and born again, ye cannot
   enter into the kingdom of heaven" Matt. xviii. 3. John iii. 3. Mark
   that he said, you cannot. It is in vain to hope for it, and in vain to
   dream that God is willing for it, for it is a thing that cannot be.

   In a word, you see then the meaning of the text, that God, the great
   law giver of the world, doth take no pleasure in the death of the
   wicked, but rather that they turn and live; though yet he be resolved
   that none shall live but those that turn, and, as a judge, even
   delighteth in justice, and in manifesting his hatred of sin, though not
   in the misery, which they have brought upon themselves, in itself
   considered.

   2. And for the proofs of the point, I shall be very brief in them,
   because I suppose you easily believe it already.

   1. The very gracious nature of God, proclaimed, Exod. xxxiv. 6. and xx.
   6. and frequently elsewhere, may assure you of this, that he hath no
   pleasure in your death.

   2. If God had more pleasure in thy death than in your conversion and
   life, he would not have so frequently commanded thee in his word, to
   turn; he would not have made thee such promises of life, if thou wilt
   but turn; he would not have persuaded thee to it by so many reasons.
   The tenor of his gospel proves the point.

   3. And his commission, that he had given to the ministers of the
   gospel, doth fully prove it. If God had taken more pleasure in your
   damnation than in thy conversion and salvation, he would never have
   charged us to offer you mercy, and to teach you the way of life, both
   publicly and privately; and to intreat and beseech you to turn and
   live; to acquaint you with your sins, and foretel you of your danger,
   and to do all that possibly we can for your conversion, and to continue
   patiently so doing, though you should hate or abuse us for our pains.
   Would God have done this, and appointed his ordinances for your good,
   if he had taken pleasure in your death?

   4. It is proved also by the course of his providence. If God had rather
   you were damned than converted and saved, he would not second his word
   with his works, and entice you by his daily kindness to himself, and
   give you all the mercies of this life, which are his means to lead you
   to repentance, Rom. ii. 4. and bring you so often under his rod to
   force you to your wits. He would not set so many examples before your
   eyes, no, nor wait on you so patiently as he doth, from day to day, and
   year to year. These are no signs of one that taketh pleasure in your
   death.--If this had been his delight, how easily could he have had thee
   long ago in hell? How often before this could he have caught thee away
   in the midst of thy sins, with a curse or oath, or lie in thy mouth, in
   thy ignorance, and pride, and sensuality? When thou wast last in thy
   drunkenness, or last deriding the ways of God, how easily could he have
   stopped thy breath, and tamed thee with his plagues, and made thee
   sober in another world? Alas! how small a matter is it for the Almighty
   to rule the tongue of the profanest railer, and tie the hands of the
   most malicious persecutor, or calm the fury of the bitterest of his
   enemies, and make them know that they are but worms? If he should frown
   upon thee, thou wouldst drop into thy grave. If he gave commission to
   one of his angels to go and destroy ten thousand sinners, how quickly
   would it be done. How easily can he lay thee upon the bed of
   languishing, and make thee lie roaring there in pain, and make thee eat
   the words of reproach which thou hast spoken against his servants, his
   word, his worship, and his holy ways, and make thee send to beg their
   prayers whom thou didst despise in your presumption! How easily can he
   lay thy flesh under gripes and groans, and make it too weak to hold thy
   soul, and make it more loathsome than the dung of the earth!--That
   flesh which now must have what it loves, and must not be displeased
   though God be displeased; and must be humored in meat, drinks, and
   clothes, whatever God says to the contrary, how quickly would the
   frowns of God consume it?--When thou wast passionately defending thy
   sin, and quarrelling with them that would have drawn thee from it, and
   shewing thy spleen against the reprover, and pleading for the works of
   darkness; how easily could God have snatched thee away in a moment, and
   set thee before his dreadful Majesty, where thou shouldest see ten
   thousand times ten thousand glorious angels waiting on his throne? and
   have called thee there to plead thy cause, and asked thee, "What hast
   thou now to say against your Creator, his truth, his servants, or his
   holy ways? Now plead thy cause, and make the best of it thou canst. Now
   what canst thou say in excuse of thy sins? Now give account of thy
   worldliness and fleshly life, of thy time, of all the mercies thou hast
   had!" O how thy stubborn heart would have melted, and thy proud looks
   be taken down, and thy countenance turned pale, and thy stout words
   changed into speechless silence, or dreadful cries, if God had but set
   you thus at his bar, and pleaded his own cause with thee, which thou
   hast here so maliciously pleaded against! How easily can he at any time
   say to thy guilty soul, "Come away, and live in that flesh no more till
   the resurrection," and it cannot resist! A word of his mouth would take
   off the poise of thy present life, and then all thy parts and powers
   would stand still: And, if he say unto thee, "Live no longer, or live
   in hell," thou couldest not disobey.

   But God hath yet done none of this, but hath patiently forborne thee,
   and mercifully upheld thee, and given thee that breath which thou didst
   breathe out against him, and given those mercies which thou did
   sacrifice to thy flesh, and afforded thee that provision, which thou
   spentest to satisfy thy greedy throat; he gave thee every minute of
   that time which thou didst waste in idleness, or drunkenness, or
   worldliness: and doth not all his patience and mercy shew that he
   desired not thy damnation? Can the candle burn without the oil? Can
   your houses stand without the earth to bear them? As well can you live
   one hour without the support of God. And why did he so long support thy
   life, but to see when thou wouldest bethink thee of the folly of thy
   ways, and return and live. Will any man purposely put arms into his
   enemy's hands to resist him; or hold a candle to a murderer that is
   killing his children, or to an idle servant that plays or sleeps the
   while? Surely it is to see whether you will at last return and live,
   that God hath so long waited on thee.

   5. It is farther proved, by the suffering of his Son, that God taketh
   no pleasure in the death of the wicked. Would he have ransomed them
   from death at so dear a rate? Would he have astonished angels and men
   by his condescension? Would God have dwelt in flesh, and have come in
   the form of a servant, and have assumed humanity into one person with
   the Godhead? And would Christ have lived a life of suffering, and died
   a cursed death for sinners, if he had rather taken pleasure in their
   death? Suppose you saw him but so busy in preaching, and healing of
   them, as you find him in Mark iii. 21. or so long in fasting, as in
   Matt. iv. or all night in prayer, as in Luke vi. 12. or praying with
   the drops of blood trickling from him instead of sweat, as Luke xxii.
   44. or suffering a cursed death upon the cross, and pouring out his
   soul as a sacrifice for our sins: Would you have thought these the
   signs of one that delighted in the death of the wicked?

   And think not to extenuate it by saying, that it was only for his
   elect: For, it was thy sin, and the sin of all the world, that lay upon
   our Redeemer; and his sacrifice and satisfaction is sufficient for all,
   and the fruits of it are offered to one as well as another: but it is
   true, that it was never the intent of his mind to pardon and save any
   that would not by faith and repentance be converted. If you had seen
   and heard him weeping and bemoaning the state of disobedient,
   impenitent people, Luke xiv. 41, 42. or complaining of their
   stubbornness, as Matt. xxiii. 37. "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how oft
   would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathereth
   her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!" Or, if you had seen
   and heard him on the cross praying for his persecutors, "Father,
   forgive them, for they know not what they do," would you have suspected
   that he had delighted in the death of the wicked, even of those that
   perish by their wilful unbelief? When God hath so loved, (not only
   loved, but so loved) the world, as to give His only-begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth in him, by an effectual faith, should not perish,
   but have everlasting life; I think he hath hereby proved, against the
   malice of men and devils, that he takes no pleasure in the death of the
   wicked, but had rather that they would turn and live.

   6. Lastly, if all this will not yet satisfy you, take his own word,
   that knoweth best his own mind, or at least believe his oath: But this
   leadeth me up to the fourth doctrine.

   Doct. 4. The Lord hath confirmed to us by his oath, that he hath no
   pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that he turn and live;
   that he may leave man no pretence to question the truth of it.

   If you dare question his word, I hope you dare not question his oath.
   As Christ hath solemnly protested that the unregenerate and unconverted
   cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven, Matt. xviii. 3. John iii. 3.
   so God hath sworn that his pleasure is not in their death, but in their
   conversion and life. And as the Apostle saith, Heb. vi. 13, 16, 17, 18.
   Because he can swear by no greater than himself, he saith, "As I live,
   &c." For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation
   is to them an end of strife: wherein God, willing more abundantly to
   shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel,
   confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things, in which it was
   impossible for God to lie, "we might have a strong consolation, who
   have fled for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set before us, which we
   have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast." If there be
   any man that cannot reconcile this truth with the doctrine of
   predestination, or the actual damnation of the wicked, that is his own
   ignorance; he hath no pretence left to deny or question therefore the
   truth of the point in hand; for this is confirmed by the oath of God,
   and therefore must not be distorted to reduce it to other points; but
   doubtful points must rather be reduced to it, and certain truths must
   be believed to agree with it, though our shallow brains do hardly
   discern the agreement.

   USE.

   I do now intreat thee, if thou be an unconverted sinner that hearest
   these words, that thou wouldest ponder a little on the forementioned
   doctrines, and bethink thyself awhile who it is that takes pleasure in
   your sin and damnation! Certainly it is not God: He hath sworn, for his
   part, that he takes no pleasure in it. And I know it is not the
   pleasing of him that you intend in it. You dare not say, that you
   drink, and swear, and neglect holy duties, and quench the motion of the
   Spirit, to please God. That were as if you should reproach the prince,
   and break his laws, and seek his death, and say you did all this to
   please him.

   Who is it then that takes pleasure in your sin and death? Not any that
   bear the image of God, for they must be like minded to him. God knows
   it is small pleasure to your faithful teachers to see you serve your
   deadly enemy, and madly venture your eternal state, and wilfully run
   into the flames of hell. It is small pleasure to them to see upon your
   souls (in the sad effects) such blindness, and hard-heartedness and
   carelessness, and presumption; such wilfulness in evil, and such
   unteachableness and stiffness against the ways of life and peace. They
   know these are marks of death, and of the wrath of God, and they know
   from the word of God what is like to be the end of them; and therefore
   it is no more pleasure to them than to a tender physician to see the
   plague-marks break out upon his patient. Alas! to foresee your
   everlasting torments, and know not how to prevent them! To see how near
   you are to hell, and we cannot make you believe it, and consider it! To
   see how easily, how certainly you might escape, if we knew but how to
   make you willing! How fair you are for everlasting salvation, if you
   would but turn and do your best, and make it the care and business of
   your lives! but you will not do it. If our lives lay on it, we cannot
   persuade you to it: We study day and night what to say to you, that may
   convince you and persuade you, and yet it is undone: We lay before you
   the word of God, and shew you the very chapter and verse where it is
   written, that you cannot be saved except you be converted, and yet we
   leave the most of you as we find you:--We hope you will believe the
   word of God, though you believe not us, and that you will regard it
   when we shew you the plain scripture for it: but we hope in vain, and
   labour in vain, as to any saving change upon your hearts. And do you
   think that this is a pleasant thing to us? Many a time in secret prayer
   we are fain to complain to God with sad hearts, "Alas! Lord, we have
   spoken to them in thy name, but they little regard us: We have told
   them what thou bidst us tell them concerning the danger of an
   unconverted state, but they do not believe us; we have told them that
   thou hast protested that "there is no peace to the wicked," Isaiah
   xlviii. 22. and lvii. 21. but the worst of them all will scarcely
   believe that they are wicked; we have shewn them thy word, where thou
   hast said, "That if they live after the flesh they shall die;" Rom.
   viii. 13. but they say, "They will believe in thee, when they will not
   believe thee; that they will trust in thee, when they give no credit to
   thy word; and when they have hope that the threatnings of thy words are
   false, they will yet call this a hoping in God; and though we shew them
   where thou hast said, that when a wicked man dieth all his hopes
   perish, yet cannot we persuade them from their deceitful hopes," Prov.
   xi. 7.--We tell them what a base unprofitable thing sin is; but they
   love it, and therefore will not leave it.--We tell them how dear they
   buy this pleasure, and that they must pay for it in everlasting
   torment; and they bless themselves, and will not believe it; but will
   do as the most do: and, because God is merciful, they will not believe
   him, but will venture their souls, come of it what will. We tell them
   how ready the Lord is to receive them; and this doth but make them
   delay their repentance and be bolder in their sin.--Some of them say
   they purpose to repent, but they are still the same; and some say they
   do repent already, while yet they are not converted from their sins. We
   exhort them, we intreat them, we offer them our help, but we cannot
   prevail with them; but they that were drunkards are drunkards still;
   and they that were voluptuous flesh-pleasing wretches are such still;
   and they that were worldlings are worldlings still; and they that were
   ignorant, and proud, and self-conceited, are so still.--Few of them
   will see and confess their sin, and fewer will forsake it, but comfort
   themselves that all men are sinners; as if there were no difference
   between a converted sinner and an unconverted. Some of them will not
   come near us when we are willing to instruct them, but think they have
   enough already, and need not our instruction; and some of them will
   give us the hearing, and do what they list; and most of them are like
   dead men that cannot feel; so that, when we tell them of the matters of
   everlasting consequence, we cannot get a word of it to their hearts. If
   we do not obey them, and humour them in baptising the children of the
   most obstinately wicked, and giving them the Lord's Supper, and doing
   all that they would have us, though never so much against the word of
   God, they will hate us, and rail at us; but if we beseech them but to
   confess and forsake their sins, and save their souls, they will not do
   it.--We tell them, if they will but turn, we will deny them none of the
   ordinances of God, neither baptism to the children, nor the Lord's
   Supper to themselves; but they will not hear us. They would have us
   disobey God, and damn our own souls to please them, and yet they will
   not turn and save their own souls to please God.--They are wiser in
   their own eyes than all their teachers; they rage and are confident in
   their own way, and, if we would never so fain, we cannot change them.
   Lord, this is the case of our miserable neighbours, and we cannot help
   it; we see them ready to drop into hell, and we cannot help it; we know
   if they would unfeignedly turn they might be saved, but we cannot
   persuade them; if we would beg it of them on our knees, we cannot
   persuade them to it; if we would beg it of them with tears, we cannot
   persuade them; and what more can we do?"

   These are the secret complaints and moans that many a poor minister is
   fain to make. And do you think that he hath any pleasure in this? Is it
   a pleasure to him to see you go on in sin, and cannot stop you? To see
   you so miserable, and cannot so much as make you sensible of it; to see
   you merry, when you are not sure to be an hour out of hell? To think
   what you must for ever suffer, because you will not turn? And to think
   what an everlasting life of glory you wilfully despise and cast away?
   What sadder thing can you bring to their hearts? And how can you devise
   to grieve them more?

   Who is it then that you pleasure by your sin and death? It is none of
   your understanding godly friends. Alas, it is the grief of their souls
   to see your misery; and they lament you many a time when you give them
   little thanks for it, and when you have not hearts to lament
   yourselves.

   Who is it then that takes pleasure in your sin? It is none but the
   three great enemies of God, whom you renounced in your baptism, and are
   now turned falsely to serve.

   1. The devil indeed takes pleasure in your sin and death; for this is
   the very end of all his temptations. For this, he watches night and
   day: you cannot devise to please him better than to go on in sin: how
   glad is he when he sees thee going to the alehouse, or other sin and
   when he heareth you curse, or swear, or rail? How glad is he when he
   heareth thee revile the minister that would draw thee from thy sin, and
   help to save thee? These are his delight.

   2. The wicked are also delighted in it; for it is agreeable to their
   nature.

   3. But I know, for all this, that it is not the pleasing of the devil
   that you intend, even when you please him; but it is your own flesh,
   the greatest and most dangerous enemy, that you intend to please. It is
   the flesh that would be pampered, that would be pleased in meat, and
   drink, and clothing; that would be pleased in your company, and pleased
   in applause and credit with the world, and pleased in sports, and
   lusts, and idleness: this is the gulf that devoureth all. This is the
   very god that you serve, for, the scripture saith of such, "that their
   bellies are their gods," Phil. iii. 18.

   But I beseech you stay a little and consider the business.

   1. Quest. Should your flesh be pleased before your Maker? Will you
   displease the Lord, and displease your teachers, and your godly
   friends, and all to please your brutish appetites, or sensual desires?
   Is not God worthy to be the ruler of your flesh? If he shall not rule
   it, he will not save it; you cannot in reason expect that he should.

   2. Quest. Your flesh is pleased with your sin; but is your conscience
   pleased? doth not it grudge within you and tell you sometimes that all
   is not well, and that your case is not so safe as you make it to be?
   and should not your soul and conscience be pleased before your
   corruptible flesh?

   3. Quest. But, is not your flesh preparing for its own displeasure
   also? It loves the bait, but doth it love the hook? It loves the strong
   drink and sweet morsels; it loves its ease, and sport, and merriment:
   it loves to be rich, and well spoken of by men, and to be somebody in
   the world: but doth it love the curse of God? Doth it love to stand
   trembling before his bar, and to be judged to everlasting fire? Doth it
   love to be tormented with the devils for ever?--Take all together: for
   there is no separating sin and hell, but only by faith and true
   conversion; if you will keep one you must have the other. If death and
   hell be pleasant to you, no wonder then if you go on in sin; but, if
   they are not (as I am sure they are not), then what if sin were never
   so pleasant, is it worth the loss of life eternal? Is a little drink,
   or meat, or ease; is the good word of sinners; are the riches of this
   world to be valued above the joys of heaven? Or are they worth the
   sufferings of eternal fire?

   These questions should be considered before you go any farther, by
   every man that hath reason to consider, and that believes he hath a
   soul to save or lose.

   Well, the Lord here sweareth that he hath no pleasure in your death,
   but rather that you would turn and live; if yet you will go on and die
   rather than turn; remember it was not to please God that you did it; it
   was to please the world, and to please yourselves. And, if men will
   damn themselves to please themselves, and run into endless torments for
   delight, and have not the wit, the heart, the grace, to hearken to God
   or man, that would reclaim them, what remedy? They must take what they
   get by it, and repent it in another manner, when it is too late! Before
   I proceed any further in the application, I shall come to the next
   doctrine; which giveth me a fuller ground for it.

   Doct. 5. So earnest is God for the conversion of sinners, that he
   doubleth his commands and exhortations with vehemency: "Turn ye, turn
   ye, why will you die?"

   This doctrine is the application of the former, as by a use of
   exhortation, and accordingly I shall handle it.

   Is there an unconverted sinner that heareth these vehement words of
   God? Is there ever a man or woman in this assembly that is yet a
   stranger to the renewing, sanctifying work of the Holy Ghost? It is a
   happy assembly, if it be not so with the most. Hearken then to the
   voice of your Maker, and turn to him by Christ without delay. Would you
   know the will of God? Why this is his will, that you presently turn.
   Shall the living God send so earnest a message to his creatures, and
   should they not obey? Hearken then, all you that live after the flesh;
   the Lord, that gave you thy breath and being, hath sent a message to
   you from heaven; and this is his message, "Turn ye, turn ye, why will
   ye die?" He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. Shall the voice of
   the eternal Majesty be neglected? If he do but terribly thunder, thou
   art afraid. O but this word concerneth thy life or death everlasting.
   It is both a command and an exhortation. As if he had said to thee, "I
   charge thee, upon the allegiance that thou owest to me your Creator and
   Redeemer, that thou renounce the flesh, the world, and the devil, and
   turn to me that you mayest live. I condescend to intreat thee, as thou
   lovest or fearest him that made thee: as thou lovest thine own life,
   even thine everlasting life, Turn and live: as ever thou wouldst escape
   eternal misery, "Turn, turn, for why wilt thou die?" And is there a
   heart in man, in a reasonable creature, that can once refuse such a
   message, such a command, such an exhortation as this? O what a thing
   then is the heart of man!

   Hearken then, all that love yourselves, and all that regard your own
   salvation:--Here is the joyfullest message that ever was sent to the
   ears of man, "Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die?" You are not yet
   shut up under desperation. Here is mercy offered you; turn, and you
   shall have it. O with what joyful hearts should you receive these
   tidings! I know this is not the first time that you have heard it; but
   how have you regarded it, or how do you regard it now? Hear, all you
   ignorant, careless sinners, the word of the Lord! Hear, all you
   worldlings, you sensual flesh-pleasers; you gluttons, and drunkards,
   and whoremongers, and swearers; you railers and backbiters, slanderers
   and liars: "Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?"

   Hear, all ye that are void of the love of God, whose hearts are not
   toward him, nor taken up with the hopes of glory, but set more by your
   earthly prosperity and delights than by the joys of heaven; all you
   that are religious but a little by the by, and give God no more than
   your flesh can spare; that have not denied your carnal selves, and
   forsaken all that you have for Christ, in the estimation and grounded
   resolution of your souls, but have some one thing in the world so dear
   to you that you cannot spare it for Christ, if he required it, but will
   rather venture on his displeasure than forsake it; "Turn ye, turn ye,
   why will ye die?"

   If you never heard it, or observed it before, remember that you were
   told it from the word of God this day, that if you will but turn, you
   may live; and if you will not turn, you shall surely die.

   What now will you do, Sirs? What is your resolution? Will you turn, or
   will you not? Halt not any longer between two opinions: If the Lord be
   God, follow him; if your flesh be God, then serve it still. If heaven
   be better than earth and fleshly pleasures, come away then, and seek a
   better country, and "lay up your treasure where rust and moths do not
   corrupt, and thieves cannot break through and steal, and be awakened at
   last with all your might to seek the kingdom that cannot be moved,"
   Heb. xii. 28. and to employ your lives on a higher design, and turn the
   stream of your cares and labours another way than formerly you have
   done. But, if earth be better than heaven, or will do more for you, or
   last you longer, then keep it, and make your best of it, and follow it
   still. Are you resolved what to do? If you be not, I will set a few
   more moving considerations before you, to see if reason will make you
   resolve.

   Consider first, "What preparations mercy hath made for your salvation:"
   and what pity it is that any man should be damned after all this. The
   time was, when the flaming sword was in the way, and the curse of God's
   law would have kept thee back if thou hadst been ever so willing to
   turn to God: The time was when thyself, and all the friends that thou
   hast in the world, could never have procured thee the pardon of thy
   sins past, though thou hadst ever so much lamented and reformed them.
   But Christ hath removed this impediment by the ransom of his blood. The
   time was, that God was wholly unreconciled, as being not satisfied for
   the violation of his law: but now he is so far satisfied and
   reconciled, as that he hath made thee a free act of oblivion, and a
   free deed of gift of Christ and life, and offereth it to thee, and
   intreateth thee to accept it, and it may be thine, if thou wilt. "For
   he was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, and hath committed
   to us the word of reconciliation," 2 Cor. v. 18, 19. Sinners, we too
   are commanded to deliver this message to you all, as from the Lord,
   "Come, for all things are ready," Luke xiv. 17. Are all things ready,
   and are you unready? God is ready to entertain you, and pardon all that
   you have done against him, if you will but come. As long as you have
   sinned, as wilfully as you have sinned, he is ready to cast all behind
   his back, if you will but come. Though you have been prodigals, and run
   away from God, and have staid so long, he is ready even to meet you,
   and embrace you in his arms, and rejoice in your conversion, if you
   will but turn.--Even the earthly worldling and swinish drunkard will
   find God ready to bid them welcome, if they will but come. Doth not
   this turn thy heart within thee?--O sinner, if thou have a heart of
   flesh, and not of stone in thee, methinks this should melt it. Shall
   the infinite Majesty of Heaven even wait for thy returning, and be
   ready to receive thee who have abused him, and forgotten him so long?
   Shall he delight in thy conversion, that might at any time glorify his
   justice in thy damnation, and yet doth it not melt thy heart within
   thee, and art thou not yet ready to come in? Hast thou not as much
   reason to be ready to come as God hath to invite thee and bid thee
   welcome?

   But, that is not all: Christ hath done his part on the cross, and made
   such way for thee to the Father, that on his account thou mayst be
   welcome if thou wilt come. And yet art thou not ready?

   A pardon is already expressly granted and offered thee in the gospel.
   And yet art thou not ready?

   The ministers of the gospel are ready to assist thee, to instruct thee;
   they are ready to pray for thee, and to seal up thy pardon by the
   administration of the holy sacrament; and yet art thou not ready?

   All that fear God about thee are ready to rejoice in thy conversion,
   and to receive thee into the communion of saints, and to give thee the
   right hand of fellowship, yea, though thou hadst been one that had been
   cast out of their society: they dare not but forgive where God
   forgiveth, when it is manifest to them, by your confession and
   amendment: they dare not so much as hit thee in the teeth with thy
   former sins, because they know that God will not upbraid thee with
   them. If thou hadst been ever so scandalous, if thou wouldst but
   heartily be converted and come in, they would not refuse thee, let the
   world say what they would against it. And, are all these ready to
   receive thee, and yet art thou not ready to come in?

   Yea, heaven itself is ready; the Lord will receive thee into the glory
   of his saints, a vile brute as thou hast been: if thou wilt but be but
   cleansed, thou mayst have a place before his throne; his angels will be
   ready to guard thy soul to the place of joy, if thou do but unfeignedly
   come in. And is God ready, the sacrifice of Christ ready, the promise
   ready, and pardon ready?--Are ministers ready, and the people of God
   ready, and heaven itself ready, and angels ready, and all these but
   waiting for your conversion, and yet art thou not ready? What! not
   ready to live, when you have been dead so long? Not ready to come to
   thy right understanding, as the prodigal is said to come to himself,
   Luke xv. 17. when thou hast been beside thyself so long? Not ready to
   be saved, when thou art even ready to be condemned?--Art thou not ready
   to lay hold on Christ, that would deliver thee, when thou art even
   ready to drown and sink into damnation? Art thou not ready to be saved
   from hell, when thou art even ready to be cast remedilessly into it?
   Alas, man! dost thou know what thou dost? If thou die unconverted there
   is no doubt to be made of your damnation, and thou art not sure to live
   an hour: and yet are thou not ready to turn and to come in? O miserable
   wretch! Hast thou not served the flesh and the devil long enough? Yet
   hast thou not enough of sin? Is it so good to thee; or so profitable
   for thee?--Dost thou know what it is, that thou wouldest yet have more
   of it? Hast thou had so many calls, and so many mercies, and so many
   blows, and so many examples? Hast thou seen so many laid in the grave,
   and yet art thou not ready to let go thy sins, and come to Christ?
   What! after so many convictions, and gripes of conscience, after so
   many purposes and promises, are thou not yet ready to turn and live?--O
   that thy eyes, thy heart, were opened, to know how fair an offer is now
   made to thee! and what a joyful message it is we are sent on, to bid
   you come, for all things are ready.

   2. Consider also, what calls thou hast to turn and live. How many, how
   loud, how earnest, how dreadful, and yet what encouraging, joyful
   calls.

   For the principal inviter is God himself. He, that commandeth heaven
   and earth, commandeth thee to turn; and presently, without delay, to
   turn: He commands the sun to run its course, and to rise upon thee
   every morning; and though it be so glorious an creature, and many times
   bigger than all the earth, yet it obeyeth him, and faileth not one
   minute of its appointed time. He commandeth all the planets and orbs of
   heaven, and they obey.--He commandeth the sea to ebb and flow, and the
   whole creation to keep its course, and all obey him. The angels of
   heaven obey his will, when he sends them to minister to such silly
   worms as we on earth, Heb. i. 14.--And yet, if he command but a sinner
   to turn, he will not obey him; he only thinks himself wiser than God,
   and he cavils and pleads the cause of sin, and will not obey. If the
   Lord Almighty say the word, the heavens and all therein obey him; but
   if he call but a drunkard out of an alehouse, he will not obey; or if
   he call a worldly fleshly sinner to deny himself; and mortify the
   flesh, and set his heart on a better inheritance, he will not obey him.

   If you had any love in thee, thou wouldst know the voice, and say, "Oh
   this is my father's call! how can I find in my heart to disobey? For,
   the sheep of Christ do know and hear his voice, and they follow him,
   and he giveth them eternal life," John, x. 4. If thou hadst any
   spiritual life and sense in thee, at least thou wouldst say, "This call
   is the dreadful voice of God, and who dares disobey?"--For says the
   prophet, Amos iii. 8. "The lion hath roared, who will not fear?" God is
   not a man, that thou shouldst dally and play with him: remember what he
   saith to Paul at his conversion, "It is hard for thee to kick against
   the pricks," Acts ix. 5. Wilt thou yet go and despise his word, and
   resist his Spirit, and stop thine ear against his call? Who is it that
   will have the worst of this? Dost thou know whom thou disobeyest and
   contendest with, and what thou art doing? It were a far wiser and
   easier task for thee to contend with the thorns, and spurn them with
   thy bare feet, and beat them with thy bare hands, or put thy head into
   the burning fire. "Be not deceived, God will not be mocked," Gal. vi.
   7. Whoever else be mocked, God will not: you had better play with the
   fire in your thatch than with the fire of his burning wrath: "For our
   God is a consuming fire," Heb. xii. 29. O how unmeet a match art thou
   for God! "It is a fearful thing to fall into his hands," Heb. x. 31.
   And therefore it is a fearful thing to contend with him, or resist him.
   As you love your souls, take heed what you do. What will you say, if he
   begin in wrath to plead with you? What will you do if he take you once
   in hand? Will you not strive against his judgment, as now you do
   against his grace? Saith the Lord, Isaiah xxvii. 4, 6. "Fury is not in
   me;" that is, I delight not to destroy you: I do it, as it were.
   unwillingly; but yet "Who would set the briars and thorns against me in
   battle? I would go through them, I would burn them together. Oh let him
   take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me, and he shall
   make peace with me!"--It is an unequal combat for the briars and
   stubble to make war with the fire.

   And thus you see who it is that calleth you, that should move you to
   hear this call, and turn; so consider also, by what instruments, and
   how often, and how earnestly, he doth it.

   1. Every leaf of the blessed book of God hath as it were a voice, and
   calls unto thee, Turn and live; turn, or thou wilt die! How canst thou
   open it, and read a leaf, or hear a chapter, and not perceive God bids
   thee turn?

   2. It is the voice of every sermon that thou hearest: For what else is
   the scope and drift of all, but to call and persuade, and intreat thee
   to turn?

   3. It is the voice of many a motion of the Spirit, that secretly speaks
   over these words again, and urgeth thee to turn.

   4. It is likely, sometimes, it is the voice of thy own conscience. Art
   thou not sometimes convinced that all is not well with thee? And doth
   not your conscience tell thee that you must be a new man, and take a
   new course, and often call thee to return?

   5. It is the voice of the gracious examples of the godly. When thou
   seest them live a heavenly life, and fly from the sin which is your
   delight, this really calls on thee to turn.

   6. It is the voice of all the works of God. For, they also are God's
   books, that teach thee this lesson, by shewing thee his greatness, and
   wisdom, and goodness; and calling thee to observe them, and admire the
   Creator, Psalm xix. 1, 2. "The heavens declare the glory of God, and
   the firmament shewth his handy work; day unto day uttereth speech,
   night unto night sheweth knowledge."--Every time the sun riseth upon
   thee, it really calleth thee to turn; as if it should say, "What do I
   travel and compass the world for, but to declare to men the glory of
   their Maker, and to light them to do his work? And do I still find thee
   doing the work of sin, and sleeping out thy life in negligence? Awake,
   thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
   light," Ephes. v. 14. "The night is spent, the day is at hand; it is
   now high time to awake out of sleep; let us therefore cast off the
   works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk
   honestly as in the day, not in rioting and in drunkenness, not in
   chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying, but put ye on the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the
   lusts thereof," Rom. xiii. 11, 12, 13, 14.--This text was the means of
   Austin's conversion.

   7. It is the voice of every mercy thou dost possess. If thou couldst
   but hear and understand them, they all cry out unto thee, turn. Why
   doth the earth bear thee, but to seek and serve the Lord? Why doth it
   afford thee its fruits, but to serve him? Why doth the air afford you
   breath, but to serve him? Why do all the creatures serve thee with
   their labours and their lives, but that thou mightst serve the Lord of
   them and thee? Why doth he give thee time, and health, and strength,
   but for to serve him? Why hast thou meat, and drink, and clothes, but
   for his service? Hast thou any thing which thou hast not received? And,
   if thou didst receive them, it is reason thou shouldst bethink thee,
   from whom, and to what end and use, thou didst receive them. Didst thou
   never cry to him for help in thy distress? And didst thou then
   understand that it was thy part to turn and serve him if he would
   deliver thee? He hath done his part, and spared thee yet longer, and
   tried thee another and another year; and yet dost thou not turn? You
   know the parable of the unfruitful figtree, Luke xiii. 6, 7, 8, 9. When
   the Lord had said, "Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?" He was
   intreated to try it one year longer, and then if it proved not
   fruitful, to cut it down. Christ himself there makes the application
   twice over, ver. 3 and 5. "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
   perish." How many years hath God looked for the fruits of love and
   holiness from thee, and hath found none, and yet hath spared thee. How
   many a time, by thy wilful ignorance, and carelessness, and
   disobedience, hast thou provoked justice to say, "Cut him down, why
   cumbereth he the ground?" And yet mercy hath prevailed, and patience
   hath forborne the fatal blow to this day. If thou hadst the
   understanding of a man within thee, thou wouldst know that all this
   calleth thee to turn.--"Dost thou think thou shalt still escape the
   judgment of God? Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and
   forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God
   leadeth thee to repentance? But, after thy hardness and impenitent
   heart, treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and
   revelation of the righteous judgment of God; who will render to every
   man according to his deeds," Rom. ii. 3, 4, 5, 6.

   8. Moreover, it is the voice or every affliction to call thee to make
   haste and turn. Sickness and pain cry turn; and poverty, and loss of
   friends, and every twig of the chastising rod cry turn; and yet wilt
   thou not hearken to the call? These have come near thee, and made thee
   feel, they have made thee groan, and can they not make thee turn?

   9. The very frame of your nature and being itself, bespeaketh thy
   return. Why hast thou reason, but to rule thy flesh, and serve thy
   Lord? Why hast thou an understanding soul, but to learn and know his
   will and do it? Why hast thou a heart within you that can love, and
   fear, and desire, but that thou shouldst fear him, and love him, and
   desire after him?

   10. Yea, thine own engagements, by promise to the Lord, do call upon
   thee to turn and serve him. Thou hast bound thyself to him by a
   baptismal covenant, and renounced the world, the flesh, and the devil;
   this thou hast confirmed by the profession of Christianity, and renewed
   it at sacraments, and in times of affliction: And wilt thou promise and
   vow, and never perform, and turn to God?

   Lay all these together, now, and see what should be the issue. The holy
   scripture calleth upon thee to turn; the ministers of Christ call upon
   thee to turn; the Spirit cries turn; thy conscience cries turn; the
   godly, by persuasions and example cry turn; the whole world, and all
   the creatures therein, that are presented to thy consideration, cry
   turn; the present forbearance of God, cries turn; all the mercies which
   thou receivest cry turn; the rod of God's chastisement cries turn; thy
   reason, and the frame of thy nature bespeaks thy turning; and so do all
   your promises to God; and yet hast thou not resolved to turn?

   11. Moreover, poor sinner! didst thou ever consider upon what terms
   thou standst all this while with him that calleth on thee to turn? Thou
   art his own, and owest him thyself and all thou hast, and may he not
   command his own? Thou art his absolute servant, and should serve no
   other master. Thou standest at his mercy, and thy life is in his hand;
   and he has resolved to save thee upon no other terms; thou hast many
   malicious spiritual enemies, that would be glad if God would but
   forsake thee, and let them alone with thee, and leave thee to their
   will; how quickly would they deal with thee in another manner? And thou
   canst not be delivered from them but by turning unto God. Thou art
   fallen under his wrath by your sin already; and thou knowest not how
   long his patience will yet wait. Perhaps this is the last year; perhaps
   the last day; his sword is even at thy heart while the word is in thine
   ear; and if thou turn not, you are a dead and undone man. Were thy eyes
   but open to see where thou standest, even upon the brink of hell, and
   to see how many thousands are there already that did not turn, thou
   wouldst see that it is time to look about thee.

   Well, Sirs, look inwards now, and tell me how are your hearts affected
   with those offers of the Lord? You hear what is his mind; he delighteth
   not in your death; he calls to you, Turn, turn: It is a fearful sign if
   all this move thee not, or if it do but half move thee; and much more
   if it make thee more careless in your misery, because thou hearest of
   the mercifulness of God. The working of the medicine will partly tell
   us whether there be any hope of the cure. O what glad tidings would it
   be to those, that are now in hell, if they had but such a message from
   God! What a joyful word would it be to hear this, Turn and live.--Yea,
   what a welcome word would it be to thyself, when thou hast felt that
   wrath of God but an hour! or, if after a thousand or ten thousand years
   torment thou couldst but hear such a word from God, Turn and live; and
   yet wilt thou neglect it, and suffer us to return without our errand?

   Behold, sinners, we are sent here as the messengers of the Lord, to set
   before you life and death. What say you? Which of them will you choose?
   Christ standeth, as it were, by thee, with heaven in the one hand, and
   hell in the other, and offereth thee thy choice; which wilt thou
   choose?--"The voice of the Lord makes the rocks to tremble," Psalm
   xxvi. And is it nothing to hear him threaten thee, if thou wilt not
   turn? Dost thou not understand and feel this voice, "Turn ye, turn ye,
   why will you die?"--Why, it is the voice of love, of infinite love, of
   thy best and kindest friend, as thou mightest easily perceive by the
   motion; and yet canst thou neglect it? It is the voice or pity and
   compassion. The Lord seeth whither thou art going better than thou
   dost, which makes him call after thee, "Turn, turn." He seeth what will
   become of thee if thou turn not. He thinketh with himself, "Ah this
   poor sinner will cast himself into endless torments if he do not turn;
   I must in justice deal with him according to my righteous law;" and
   therefore he calleth after thee, Turn, turn, O sinner! If you did but
   know the thousandth part as well as God doth, the danger that is near
   you, and the misery that you are running into, we should have no more
   need to call after you to turn.

   Moreover, this voice that calls to thee, is the same that hath
   prevailed with thousands already, and called all to heaven that are now
   there: and they would not now, for a thousand worlds, that they had
   made light of it, and not turned to God. Now what are they possessing
   that turned at God's call? Now they perceive that it was indeed the
   voice of love that meant them no more harm than their salvation. And,
   if thou wilt obey the same call, thou shalt come to the same happiness.
   There are millions that must for ever lament that they turned not; but
   there is never a soul in heaven that is sorry that they are converted.

   Well, Sirs, are you yet resolved, or are you not? Do I need to say any
   more to you? What will you do? Will you turn or not? Speak, man, in thy
   heart to God, though you speak not out to me; speak, lest he take your
   silence for denial; speak quickly, lest he never make you the like
   offer more. Speak resolvedly, and not waveringly, for he will have no
   indifferents to be his followers. Say in thy heart now, without any
   more delay, even before thou stir from hence, "By the grace of God I am
   resolved presently to turn. And because I know my own insufficiency, I
   am resolved to wait on God for his grace, and to follow him in his
   ways, and forsake my former courses and companions and give up myself
   to the guidance of the Lord."

   You are not shut up in the darkness of heathenism, nor in the
   desperation of the damned.--Life is before you; and you may have it on
   reasonable terms, if you will; yea, on free cost, if you will accept
   it. The way of God lieth plain before you; the church is open to you;
   you may have Christ, and pardon, and holiness, if you will. What say
   you? Will you, or will you not? If you say nay, or say nothing, and
   still go on, God is witness, and this congregation is witness, and your
   own consciences are witnesses, how fair an offer you had this day.
   Remember, you might have had Christ, and would not. Remember, when you
   have lost it, that you might have had eternal life as well as others,
   and would not; and all because you would not turn.

SERMON III.

   Ezek. xxxiii. 11.

   Say to them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
   death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.
   Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways, for, why will ye die, O house of
   Israel?

   IT has been explained, and proved, that God taketh pleasure in men's
   conversion and salvation, but not in their death or damnation. He would
   rather they would turn and live, than go on and die:--That he may leave
   man no pretence to doubt of it, the Lord hat confirmed it to us by his
   oath. Yea, farther, so earnest is God for the conversion of sinners,
   that he doubleth his commands and exhortations with vehemency, Turn ye,
   turn ye.

   Having already illustrated and applied each of these points, let us
   come to the next doctrine, and hear your reasons.

   Doct. 6. The Lord condescends to reason the case with unconverted
   sinners, and to ask them why they will die.

   A strange disputation it is, both as to the controversy and as to the
   disputants.

   1. The controversy or question, propounded to dispute of, is, "Why
   wicked men will damn themselves?" Or, "Why they will rather die than
   turn?" Whether they have any sufficient reason for so doing?

   2. The disputants are God and man; the most holy God, and wicked
   unconverted sinners.

   Is it not a strange thing, which God doth seem here to suppose, that
   any man should be willing to die and be damned? Yea, that this should
   be the case of the wicked; that is, of the greatest part of the world:
   But, you will say, this cannot be, for nature desireth the preservation
   and felicity of itself, and the wicked are more selfish than others,
   and not less; and therefore how can any man be willing to be
   damned?--To which I answer:

   1. It is a certain truth that no man can be willing of any evil as
   evil, but only as it hath some appearance of good; much less can any
   man be willing to be eternally tormented. Misery, as such, is desired
   by none.

   2. But yet, for all that, it is most true which God here teacheth us,
   that the cause, why the wicked die and are damned, is, because, they
   will die and be damned. And this is true in several respects.

   1. Because they will go the way that leads to hell, though they are
   told by God and man whither it goes, and where it ends; and though God
   hath so often professed in his word, that if they hold on in that way,
   they shall be condemned, and that they shall not be saved unless they
   turn, Isaiah xlviii. 22. and lvii. 21. "There is no peace, saith the
   Lord, unto the wicked." Isaiah lix. 8. "The way of peace they know not;
   there is no judgment in their goings; they have made them crooked
   paths; whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace." They have the
   word and the oath of the living God for it; that, if they will not
   turn, they shall not enter into his rest.--And yet wicked they are, and
   wicked they will be, let God and man say what they will; fleshly they
   are, and fleshly they will be, worldlings they are, and worldlings they
   will be; though God hath told them that "the love of the world is
   enmity to God; and that if any man love the world, the love of the
   Father is not in him," James 4. iv. 1 John ii. 15. So that,
   consequently, these men are willing to be damned, though not directly;
   they are willing to walk in the way to hell, and love the certain cause
   of their torment; though they be not willing of hell itself, and do not
   love the pain which they must endure.

   Is not this the truth of your case, sinners? You would not burn in
   hell; but you will kindle the fire by your sins, and cast yourselves
   into it; you would not be tormented with devils for ever, but you will
   do that which will certainly procure it, in despite of all that can be
   said against it. It is just as if you would say, "I will drink this
   poison, but you I will not die. I will cast myself headlong from the
   top of a steeple, but yet I will not kill myself.--I will thrust this
   knife into my heart, but yet I will not take away my life. I will put
   this fire into the thatch of my house, but yet I will not burn
   it."--Just so it is with wicked men; they will be wicked, and they will
   live after the flesh and the world, and yet they would not be damned.
   But do you not know that the means do lead to the end? and that God
   hath by his righteous law concluded, that you must repent or perish?
   He, that will take poison, may as well say plainly, "I will kill
   myself;" for it will prove no better in the end: Though perhaps he
   loved it for the sweetness of the sugar that was mixt with it, and
   would not be persuaded that it was poison, but that he might take it
   and do well enough; but it is not his conceits and confidence that will
   save his life. So, if you will be drunkards, or fornicators, or
   worldlings, or live after the flesh, you may as well say plainly, "We
   will be damned." for so you will be unless you turn. Would you not
   rebuke the folly of a thief or murderer, that would say, "I will steal
   and kill, but I shall not be hanged," when he knows that, if he do the
   one, the judge in justice will see that the other be done? If he say,
   "I will steal and murder," he may as well say plainly, "I will be
   hanged." So, if you will go on in a carnal life, you may as well say
   plainly, "We will go to hell."

   2. Moreover, the wicked will not use those means, without which there
   is no hope of their salvation. He that will not eat, may as well say
   plainly, he will not live, unless he can tell how to live without meat;
   he that will not go his journey, may as well say plainly he will not
   come to the end. He that falls into the water, and will not come out,
   nor suffer another to help him out, may as well say plainly, he will be
   drowned. So if you be carnal and ungodly, and will not be converted,
   nor use the means by which you should be converted, but think it more
   ado than needs, you may as well say plainly, you will be damned. For if
   you have found out a way to be saved without conversion, you have done
   that which was never done before.

   3. Yes, this is not all; but the wicked are unwilling even to partake
   of salvation itself. Tho' they may desire somewhat which they call by
   the name of heaven, yet heaven itself, considered in the true nature of
   its felicity, they desire not; yea, their hearts are quite against it.
   Heaven is a state of perfect holiness, and of continual love and praise
   to God and the wicked have no heart to this. The imperfect love, and
   praise, and holiness, which is here to be attained, they have no mind
   of; much less of that which is so much greater: The joys of heaven are
   of so pure and spiritual a nature, that the heart of the wicked cannot
   desire them.

   So that by this time you may see on what ground it is, that God
   supposeth that the wicked are willing their own destruction; they will
   rather venture on certain misery than be converted; and then, to quiet
   themselves in their sins, they will make themselves believe that they
   shall nevertheless escape.

   2. And as this controversy is matter of wonder (that even men should be
   such enemies to themselves, as wilfully to cast away their souls) so
   are the disputants too. That God should stoop so low as thus to plead
   the case with man; and that men should be so strangely blind and
   obstinate as to need all this in so plain a case; yea, and to resist
   all this, when their own salvation lieth upon the issue!

   No wonder that they will not hear us that are men, when they will not
   hear the Lord himself: As God saith, Ezek. iii. 7, when He sent the
   prophet to the Israelites, "The house of Israel will not hearken unto
   thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel
   are impudent and hard-hearted" No wonder if they can plead against a
   minister, or a godly neighbour, when they will plead against the Lord
   himself; even against the plainest passages of his word, and think that
   they have reason on their side. When they weary the Lord with their
   words, they say, "Wherein have we wearied Him?" Mal. ii. 17. The
   priests, that despised His name, durst ask, "Wherein have we despised
   your name?" And when they polluted his altar, and made the temple of
   the Lord contemptible they durst say, "Wherein have we polluted thee?"
   Mal. i. 6, 7. But "Wo unto him, saith the Lord, that striveth with his
   Maker: Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth: Shall
   the clay say to him that fashioned it, What makest thou?" Isaiah xlv.
   9.

   Quest. But why is it that God will reason the case with man?

   Ans. 1. Because that man being a reasonable creature, is accordingly to
   be dealt with, and by reason to be persuaded and overcome; God hath
   therefore endowed them with reason, that they might use it for him. One
   would think a reasonable creature should not go against the clearest
   and the greatest reason in the world, when it is set before him.

   2. At least, men shall see that God did require nothing of them that
   was unreasonable, but that whatever forbideth them, he hath all the
   right reason in the world on his side: And they have good reason to
   obey him, but none to disobey. And thus even the damned shall be forced
   to justify God, and confess that it was only reasonable that they
   should have turned to him; and they shall be forced to condemn
   themselves, and confess that they had little reason to cast away
   themselves by the neglecting of His grace in the day of their
   visitation.

   USE.

   Look up your best and strongest reasons, sinners, if you will make good
   your way:--You see now with whom you have to deal.--What say thou,
   unconverted, sensual sinner? Darest thou venture upon a dispute with
   God? Art thou able to confute him? Art thou ready to enter the lists?
   God asketh thee, Why wilt thou die? Art thou furnished with a
   sufficient answer? Wilt thou undertake to prove that God is mistaken,
   and that thou art in the right? O what an undertaking is that!--Why,
   either he or you are mistaken, when he is for your conversion, and you
   are against it: He calls upon you to turn, and you will not; He bids
   you do it presently, even to-day, while it is called to-day, and you
   delay, and think it time enough hereafter.--He saith it must be a total
   change, and you must be holy, and new creatures, and born again; and
   you think that less may serve the turn, and that it is enough to patch
   up the old man, without becoming new. Who is in the right now? God or
   you? God calleth on you to turn, and to live a holy life, and you will
   not; by your disobedient lives it appears you will not. If you will,
   why do you not? Why have you not done it all this while? And why do you
   not fall upon it yet? Your wills have the command of your lives. We may
   certainly conclude that you are unwilling to turn, when you do not
   turn. And, why will you not? Can you give any reason for it that is
   worthy to be called a reason?

   I, that am but a worm, your fellow-creature, of a shallow capacity,
   dare challenge the wisest of you all to reason the case with me, while
   I plead my Maker's cause; and I need not be discouraged, when I know I
   plead but the cause that God pleadeth, and contend for him that will
   have the best at last. Had I but these two general grounds against you,
   I am sure that you have no good reason on your side.

   1. I am sure it can be no good reason which is against the God of truth
   and reason. It cannot be light that is contrary to the sun. There is no
   knowledge in any creature but what it has from God; and therefore none
   can be wiser than God. It were fatal presumption for the highest angel
   to compare with his Creator. What is it then for a lump of dirt, an
   ignorant sot, that knoweth not himself, nor his own soul, that knoweth
   but little of the things which he seeth, yet that is more ignorant than
   many of his neighbours, to set himself against the wisdom of the Lord?
   It is one of the fullest discoveries of the horrible wickedness of
   carnal men, and the stark madness of such as sin, that so silly a mole
   dare contradict his Maker, and call in question the word of God: Yea,
   that those people in our parishes, that are so ignorant, that they
   cannot give us a reasonable answer concerning the very principles of
   religion, are yet so wise in their own conceit, that they dare question
   the plainest truths of God, yea, contradict them and cavil against
   them, when they can scarce speak sense, and will believe them no
   farther than agreeth with their foolish wisdom.

   2. And as I know that God must needs be in the right, so I know the
   case is so palpable and gross which he pleadeth against, that no man
   can have reason for it. Is it possible that a man can have any reason
   to break his master's laws? and reason to dishonor the Lord of glory?
   and reason to abuse the Lord that bought him? Is it possible that a man
   can have any good reason to damn his own immortal soul?--Mark the
   Lord's question, "Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?" Is eternal death
   a thing to be desired? Are you in love with hell? What reason have you
   wilfully to perish? If you think you have reason to sin, should you not
   remember that "death is the wages of sin," Rom. vi. 23. and think
   whether you have any reason to undo yourselves, body and soul, for
   ever?--You should not only ask whether you love the adder, but whether
   you love the sting?--It is such a thing for a man to cast away his
   everlasting happiness, and to sin against God, that no good reason can
   be given for it; but, the more anyone pleads for it, the madder he
   sheweth himself to be. Had you a lordship or a kingdom offered you for
   every sin that you commit, it were not reason, but madness, to accept
   it. Could you by every sin obtain the highest thing on earth that flesh
   desireth, it were no considerable value to persuade you in reason to
   commit it. If it were to please your greatest or dearest friends, or to
   obey the greatest prince on earth, or to save your lives, or to escape
   the greatest earthly misery; all these are of no consideration to draw
   a man in reason to the committing of one sin. If it were a right hand
   or a right eye that would hinder your salvation, it is the gainfullest
   way to cast it away, rather than to go to hell to save it; for there is
   no saving a part when you lose the whole. So exceedingly great are the
   matters of eternity, that nothing in this world deserveth once to be
   named in comparison with them; nor can any earthly thing, though it
   were life, or crowns, or kingdoms, be a reasonable excuse for the
   neglect of matters of such high and everlasting consequence. A man can
   have no reason to cross his ultimate end. Heaven is such a thing, that,
   if you lose it, nothing can supply the want, or make up the loss: and
   hell its such a thing, that, if you suffer it, nothing can remove your
   misery, or give you ease and comfort. And therefore nothing can be a
   valuable consideration to excuse you for neglecting your own salvation;
   for, saith our Saviour, "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain
   the whole world, and lose his own soul?" Mark viii. 36.

   O sirs, that you did but know what matters they are that we are now
   speaking to you of! The saints in heaven have other kind of thoughts of
   these things. If the devil could come to them that live in the sight
   and love of God, and should offer them a cup of ale, or a whore, or
   merry company, or sport to entice them away from God and glory; I pray
   you tell me, how do you think they would entertain the motion? Nay, or
   if he should offer them to be kings of the earth, do you think this
   would entice them down from heaven? O with what hatred and holy scorn
   would they disdain and reject the motion! And why should not you do so,
   that have heaven opened to your faith, if you had but faith to see it?
   There is never a soul in hell but knows, by this time, that it was a
   mad exchange to let go heaven for fleshly pleasure, and that it is not
   a little mirth, or pleasure, or worldly riches, or honour, or the good
   will or word of men, that will quench hell fire, or make him a saver
   that loseth his soul. Oh! if you had heard what I believe, if you had
   seen what I believe, and that on the credit of the word of God, you
   would say there can be no reason to warrant a man to damn his soul: you
   durst not sleep quietly another night, before you had resolved to turn
   and live.

   If you see a man put his hand in the fire till it burn off, you will
   marvel at it; but this is a thing that a man may have a reason for; as
   Bishop Cranmer had when he burnt off his hand for subscribing to
   Popery. If you see a man cut off a leg or arm, it is a sad sight; but
   this is a thing that a man may have a good reason for; as many a man
   doth to save his life. If you see a man give his body to be burnt to
   ashes, and to be tormented with racks, and refuse deliverance when it
   is offered, that is a hard case to flesh and blood: but this a man may
   have good reason for; as you may see in Heb. xi. 33, 34, 35, 36. and as
   many a hundred martyrs have done. But, for a man to forsake the Lord
   that made Him, and to run into the fire of hell, when he is told of it,
   and intreated to turn that he may be saved; this is a thing that can
   have no reason in the world, that is reason indeed, to justify or
   excuse it. For heaven will pay for the loss of any thing that we can
   lose to get it; but nothing can pay for the loss of heaven.

   I beseech you now let this word come nearer to your hearts. As you are
   convinced that you have no reason to destroy yourselves, so tell me
   what reason have you to refuse to turn, and live to God? What reason
   hath the veriest worldling, or drunkard, or ignorant careless sinner of
   you all, why you should not be as holy as any you know, and be as
   careful for your souls as any other? Will not hell be as hot to you as
   to others? Should not your own souls be as dear to you as theirs is
   them? Hath not God as much authority over you? Why then will you not
   become a sanctified people as well as they?

   O Sirs, when God bringeth the matter down to the very principles of
   nature, and shews that you have no more reason to be ungodly than you
   have to damn your own souls! if yet you will not understand and turn,
   it seems a desperate case that you are in. And now, either you have
   reason for what you do, or you have not: if not, will you go against
   reason itself? Will you do that which you have no reasons for? But, if
   you think you have, produce them, and make the best of your matter.
   Reason the case a little with me, your fellow-creature, which is far
   easier than to reason the case with God. Tell me, man, here before the
   Lord, as if thou wert to die this hour, why shouldst thou not resolve
   to turn this day, before thou stir from the place thou standest in?
   What reason hast thou to deny, or to delay? Hast thou any reason that
   satisfieth thine own conscience for it? Or any that thou darest own and
   plead at the bar of God? If thou hast, let us hear them, bring them
   forth, and make them good. But, alas! what poor stuff, what nonsense
   instead of reasons, do we daily hear from ungodly men? But for their
   necessity, I should be ashamed to name them.

   1. One saith, "If none shall be saved but such converted and sanctified
   ones as you talk of, then heaven would be but empty, then God help a
   great many!

   Ans. What! it seems you think that God doth not know, or else that he
   is not to be believed! Measure not all by yourselves; God hath
   thousands and millions of his sanctified ones; but yet they are few in
   comparison of the world, as Christ himself hath told us, Matt. vii. 13,
   14. Luke xii. 32. It better beseems you to make that use of this truth
   which Christ teaches you: "Strive to enter in at the strait gate; for
   strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and
   few there be that find it; but wide is the gate and broad is the way,
   that leads to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat." Luke
   xiii. 22, 23, 24.--"Fear not, little flock, (saith Christ to his
   sanctified ones) for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the
   kingdom," Luke xii. 32.

   Object. 2. I am sure if such as I go to hell, we shall have store of
   company.

   Ans. And will that be any ease or comfort to you? Or do you think you
   may not have company enough in heaven? Will you be undone for company?
   Or will you not believe that God will execute his threatnings, because
   there be so many that are guilty? All these are silly unreasonable
   conceits.

   Object. 3. But all men are sinners, even the best of you all?

   Ans. But all are not unconverted sinners. The godly live not in gross
   sins; and their very infirmities are their grief and burden, which they
   daily long, and pray, and strive to be rid of. Sin hath not dominion
   over them.

   Object. 4. I do not see that professors are any better than other men;
   they will over-reach, and oppress, and are as covetous as any.

   Ans. Whatever hypocrites are, it is not so with those that are
   sanctified. God hath thousands and tens of thousands that are
   otherwise; though the malicious world doth accuse them of what they can
   never prove, and of that which never entered into their hearts. And
   commonly they charge them with heart-sins, which none can see but God;
   because they can charge them with no such wickedness in their lives as
   they are guilty of themselves.

   Object. 5. But I am no whoremonger, nor drunkard, nor oppressor, and
   therefore why shouldest thou call me to be converted?

   Ans. As if you were not born after the flesh, and had not lived after
   the flesh, as well as others! Is it not as great a sin as any of these,
   for a man to have an earthly mind, and to love the world above God, and
   to have an unbelieving, unhumbled heart? Nay, let me tell you more;
   that many persons, that avoid disgraceful sins are as fast glued to the
   world, and as much slaves to the flesh, and as strange to God, and
   averse to heaven in their more civil discourse, as others are in their
   more shameful and notorious sins.

   Object. 6. But I mean nobody any harm, nor do any harm; and why then
   should God condemn me?

   Ans. Is it no harm to neglect the Lord that made thee, and the work for
   which thou camest into the world, and to prefer the creature before the
   Creator, and to neglect grace that is daily offered thee? It is the
   depth of your sinfulness to be insensible of it; the dead feel not that
   they are dead. If once thou wert made alive, thou wouldst see more
   amiss in thyself, and marvel at thyself for making so light of it.

   Object. 7. I think you would make men mad under pretence of converting
   them; it is enough to rack the brains of sinful people, to muse so much
   on matters too high for them.

   Ans. 1. Can you be madder than you are already? Or at least, can there
   be a more dangerous madness than to neglect your everlasting welfare,
   and wilfully undo yourselves?

   2. A man is never well in his wits till he be converted; he never knows
   God, nor knows sin, nor knows Christ, nor knows the world, nor himself,
   nor what his business is on earth, so as to set himself about it, till
   he be converted.--The scripture saith, "That the wicked are
   unreasonable men," 2 Thess. iii. 2. and, "That the wisdom of the world
   is foolishness with God," 1 Cor. i. 20 and Luke xv. 17. It is said of
   the prodigal, that, "when he came to himself," he resolved to
   return.--It is a wise world, when men will disobey God, and run to hell
   for fear of being out of their wits.

   3. What is there in the work that Christ calls you, that should drive a
   man out of his wits? Is it the loving of God, and calling upon him, and
   comfortably thinking of the glory to come, and the forsaking of our
   sins, and loving one another, and delighting ourselves in the service
   of God? Are these such things as should make men mad?

   4. And whereas you say that these matters are too high for us, you
   accuse God himself for making this our work, and giving us his word,
   and commanding all that will be blessed to meditate on it day and
   night. Are the matters which we are made for, and which we live for,
   too high for us to meddle with? This is plainly to unman us, and to
   make brutes of us, as if we were like them that must meddle with no
   higher matters than what belongs to flesh and earth. If heaven be too
   high for you to think on and provide for, it will be too high for you
   ever to possess.

   5. If God should sometimes suffer any weak-headed persons to be
   distracted by thinking of eternal things; this is because they
   misunderstand them, and run without a guide; and, of the two, I had
   rather be in the case of such a one, than of the mad unconverted world,
   that take their distraction to be their wisdom.

   Object. 8. I do not thing that God cares so much what men think, or
   speak, or do, as to make so great a matter of it.

   Ans. It seems, then, you take the word of God to be false, and then
   what will you believe? But your own reason might teach you better, if
   you believe not the scriptures: for you see God sets not so light by
   us, but that he vouchsafeth to make us, and still preserveth us, and
   daily upholdeth us, and provideth for us; and will any wise man make a
   curious frame for nothing? Will you make or buy a clock or watch, and
   daily look at it, and not care whether it go true or false? Surely, if
   you believe not a particular eye of Providence observing your hearts
   and lives, you cannot believe or expect any particular Providence to
   observe your wants and troubles to relieve you. And, if God had so
   little cared for you as you imagine, you would never have lived till
   now; a hundred diseases would have striven which should first destroy
   you; yea, the devils would have haunted you, and fetched you away
   alive, as the great fishes devour the less, and as ravenous birds and
   beasts devour others. You cannot think that God made man for no end or
   use; and, if he made him for any, it was sure for himself. And can you
   think he cares not whether his ends be accomplished, and whether we do
   the work that we are made for?

   Yea, by this atheistical objection you make God to have made and
   upholden all the world in vain. For, what are all other lower creatures
   for, but for man? What doth the earth, but bear and nourish us? and the
   beasts do serve us with their labours and lives: and so of the rest.
   And hath God made so glorious a habitation, and set man to dwell in it,
   and made all his servants; and now doth he look for nothing at his
   hands? nor care how he thinks, or speaks, or lives? This is most
   unreasonable.

   Object. 9. It was a better world when men did not make so much ado in
   religion.

   Ans. 1. It hath ever been the custom to praise the times past. That
   world, that you speak of, was wont to say, it was a better world in
   their forefathers' days, and so did they of their forefathers. This is
   but an old custom, because we all feel the evil of our own times, but
   we see not that which was before us.

   2. Perhaps you speak as you think: worldlings think the world is at the
   best, when it is agreeable to their minds, and when they have most
   mirth and worldly pleasure. And I doubt not but the devil, as well as
   you, would say, that then it was a better world, for then he had more
   service and less disturbance. But the world is at the best when God is
   most loved, regarded, and obeyed. And how else will you know when the
   world is good or bad, but, by this?

   Object. 10. There are so many ways and religions that we know not which
   to be of, and therefore we will be even as we are.

   Ans. Because there are many, will you be of that way that you may be
   sure is wrong? None are farther out of the way than worldly, fleshly,
   unconverted sinners; for, they do not only err in this or that opinion,
   but in the very scope and drift or their lives. If you were going a
   journey that your life lay on, would you stop or turn again, because
   you met with some cross-ways, or because you saw some travelers go the
   horse way, and some the foot way, and some perhaps break over the
   hedge, yea, and some miss the way? or would you not rather be the more
   careful to inquire the way? If you have some servants that know not how
   to do your work right, and some that are unfaithful; would you take it
   well of any of the rest that would therefore be idle, and do you no
   service, because they see their companions so bad?

   Object. 11. I do not see that it goes any better with those that are so
   godly than with other men; they are as poor, and in as much trouble as
   others.

   Ans. And perhaps in much more, when God sees it meet. They take not
   earthly prosperity for their wages; they have laid up their treasure
   and hopes in another world, or else they are not Christians indeed; the
   less they have, the more is behind, and they are content to wait till
   then.

   Object. 12. When you have said all that you can, I am resolved to hope
   well and trust in God, and do as well as I can, and not make so much
   ado.

   Ans. 1. Is that doing as well as you can, when you will not turn to
   God, but your heart is against his holy and diligent service? It is as
   well as you will indeed, but that is your misery.

   2. My desire is, that you should hope and trust in God: But, for what
   is it that you would hope? Is it to be saved, if you turn and be
   sanctified? For this you have God's promise, and therefore hope for it,
   and spare not. But if you hope to be saved, without conversion and a
   holy life, this is not to hope in God, but in Satan, or yourselves; for
   God hath given you no such promise, but told you the contrary; but it
   is Satan and self-love, that made you such promises, and raised you to
   such hopes.--Well, if these and such as these, be all you have to say
   against conversion and a holy life, your all is nothing, and worse than
   nothing: And if these, and such as these, seem reasons sufficient to
   persuade you to forsake God, and cast yourselves into hell, the Lord
   deliver you from such reasons, and from such blind understandings, and
   from such senseless hardened hearts. Dare you stand to aver one of
   there reasons at the bar of God? Do you think it will then serve your
   turn to say, "Lord, I did not turn, because I had so much to do in the
   world, or because I did not like the lives of some professors; or
   because I saw men of so many minds?"--O how easily will the light of
   that day shame such reasonings as these! Had you the world to look
   after? Let the world which you served now pay you your wages, and save
   you if it can. Had you not a better world to look after first? And were
   you not commanded, to 'seek first God's kingdom and righteousness; and
   promised that other things should be added to you?" Matt. vi. 33. And
   were ye not told, "that godliness was profitable to all things, having
   the promise of this life, and that which is to come?" 1 Tim. iv. 8. Did
   the sins of the professors hinder you? You should rather have been the
   more heedful, and learned by their falls to beware, and have been the
   more careful, and not the more careless. It was the Scripture, and not
   their lives, that was your rule. Did the many opinions of this world
   hinder you? Why the Scripture, that was your rule, did teach you but
   one way, and that was the right way; if you had followed that, even in
   so much as was plain and easy, you should never have miscarried. Will
   not such answers as these silence you? If these will not, God hath
   those that will; when he asketh the man, Matt. xxii. 12. "Friend, how
   comest thou in hither, not having on a wedding-garment?" That is, what
   dost thou in my church among professed Christians, without a holy heart
   and life? What answer did he make? Why the text saith, he was
   speechless; he had nothing to say. The clearness of the case, and the
   Majesty of God, will then easily stop the mouths of the most confident
   of you, tho' you will not be put down by any thing we can say to you
   now; but will make good your cause, be it ever so bad. I know already,
   that never a reason that now you can give me will do you any good at
   last, when your case must be opened before the Lord and all the world.
   Nay, I scarce think that your own consciences are well satisfied with
   your reasons. For, if they are, it seems then you have not so much as
   purposed to repent. But, if you purpose to repent, it seems you do not
   put much confidence in your reasons which you bring against it. What
   say you, unconverted sinners? Have you any good reasons to give, why
   you should not turn, and presently turn, with all your hearts? Or will
   you go to hell in despite of reason itself? Bethink you what you do in
   time, for it will shortly be too late to bethink you.--Can you find any
   fault with God, or his work, or his wages? Is he a bad master? Is the
   devil, whom you serve, a better? Or is the flesh a better? Is there any
   harm in a holy life? Is a life of worldliness and ungodliness better?
   Do you think in your consciences, that it would do you any harm to be
   converted and live a holy life? What harm can it do you? Is it harm to
   you to have the spirit of Christ within you? And to have a cleansed
   purified Heart? If it be bad to be holy, why doth God say, "Be ye holy,
   for I am holy." 1 Pet. i. 15, 16. Lev. xx. 7. Is it evil to be like
   God? Is it not said, "that God made man in His own image?" Why, this
   holiness is his image. This Adam lost, and this Christ by his word and
   Spirit would restore to you, as he doth to all that he will save. Why
   were you baptized into the Holy Ghost? and why do you baptize your
   children into the Holy Ghost as your sanctifier, if you will not be
   sanctified by him, but think it hard for you to be sanctified? Tell me
   truly, as before the Lord, tho' you are loathe to live a holy life, had
   you not rather die in the case of those that do so than of others? If
   you were to die this day, had you not rather die in the case of a
   converted man than of an unconverted? Of a holy and heavenly man than
   of a carnal earthily man? And would you not say, as Balaam, Numb.
   xxiii. 10. "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end
   be like his?" And why will you not now be of the mind that you will be
   of then? First or last you must come to this, either to be converted,
   or to wish you had been, when it is too late. But what is it that you
   are afraid of losing if you turn? Is it your friends? you will but
   change them; God will be your friend, and Christ, and the Spirit, will
   be your friend, and every Christian will be your friend. You will get
   one friend that will stand you in more stead than all the friends in
   the world could have done. The friends you lose would have but enticed
   you to hell; but could not have delivered you: But the friend you get
   will save you from hell, and bring you to His own eternal rest.

   Is it your pleasure that you are afraid of losing? You think you shall
   never have a merry day again, if once you be converted. Alas! that you
   should think it a greater pleasure to live in foolish sports and
   merriments, and please your flesh, than to live in the believing
   thoughts of glory, and in the love of God, and in righteousness, and
   peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, in which the state of grace
   consisteth! Rom. xiv. 17. If it would be a greater pleasure for you to
   think of your lands and inheritance (if you were lords of all the
   country) than it is for a child to play for pins: why should it not be
   a greater joy to you to think of the kingdom of heaven being yours than
   of all the riches or pleasures of the world? As it is but foolish
   childishness that makes children so delight in toys that they would not
   leave them for all your land, so it is but foolish worldliness, and
   fleshliness and wickedness, that make you so much delight in your
   houses, and lands, and meat, and drink, and ease, and honour, as that
   you would not part with them for the heavenly delights. But what will
   you do for pleasure when these are gone? Do you not think of that? When
   your pleasures end in horror, and go out like a stinking snuff, the
   pleasures of the saints are then at best. I have had myself but a
   little taste of the heavenly pleasures in the forethoughts of the
   blessed approaching day, and in the present persuasions of the love of
   God in Christ; but I have taken too deep a draught of earthily
   pleasures, so that you may see, if I be partial, it is on your side;
   and yet I must profess, from that little experience, that there is no
   comparison.--There is more joy to be had in a day, (if the sun of life
   shine clear upon us) in the state of holiness, than in a whole life of
   sinful pleasures. I had "rather be a door-keeper in the house of God,
   than to dwell in the tents of wickedness." (Psalm lxxxiv. 10). "A day
   in his courts is better than a thousand any where else," Psalm lxxxiv.
   13. The mirth of the wicked is like the laughter of a madman, that
   knows not his own misery; and therefore Solomon saith of such laughter,
   "it is mad, and of mirth, what doth it?" Eccles. ii. 2. and Eccles.
   vii. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. "It is better to go to the house of mourning than
   to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the
   living will lay it to his heart. Sorrow is better than laughter; "for
   by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better. The heart
   of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in
   the house of mirth. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than
   to hear the song of fools; for as the crackling of thorns under a pot,
   so is the laughter of the fool." All the pleasure of fleshly things is
   but like the scratching of a man that hath the itch; it is his disease
   that makes him desire it; and a wise man had rather be without his
   pleasure than be troubled with his itch. Your loudest laughter is but
   like that of a man that is tickled; he laughs when he hath no cause of
   joy. Judge, as you are men, whether this be a wise man's part. It is
   but your carnal unsanctified nature that makes a holy life seem
   grievous to you, and a course of sensuality seem more delightful. If
   you will but turn, the Holy Ghost will give you another nature and
   inclination, and then it will be more pleasant to you to be rid of your
   sin than now it is to keep it; and you will then say, that you knew not
   what a comfortable life was till now, and that it was never well with
   you till God and holiness were your delight.

   Quest. But how it cometh to pass that men should be so unreasonable in
   the matters of salvation? They have wit enough in other matters, what
   makes them so loathe to be converted, that there should need so many
   words in so plain a case, and all will not do, but the most will live
   and die unconverted?

   Answer. To name them only in a few words, the causes are these:

   1. Men are naturally in love with the earth and flesh, and their nature
   hath an enmity to God and godliness, as the nature of a serpent hath to
   a man: And when all that we can say goeth against an habitual
   inclination of their natures, no marvel if it little prevail.

   2. They are in darkness, and know not the very things they hear. Like a
   man that was born blind, and hears a high commendation of the light:
   But what will hearing do unless he sees it? They know not what God is,
   nor what is the power of the cross of Christ, nor what the spirit of
   holiness is, nor what it is to live in love by faith; they know not the
   certainty, and suitableness, and excellency of the heavenly
   inheritance. They know not what conversion, and a holy mind and
   conversation, are, even when they hear of them. They are in a mist of
   ignorance. They are lost and bewildered in sin; like a man that hath
   lost himself in the night, and knows not where he is, nor how to come
   to himself again till the day-light recover Him.

   3. They are wilfully confident that they need no conversion, but some
   partial amendment; and that they are in the way to heaven already, and
   are converted when they are not. And, if you meet a man that is quite
   out of his way, you may long enough call on him to turn back again, if
   he will not believe you that he is out of the way.

   4. They are become slaves to their flesh, and drowned in the world to
   make provision for it. Their lusts, and passions, and appetites, have
   distracted them, and got such a hand over them, that they cannot tell
   how to deny them, or how to mind any thing else. So that the drunkard
   saith, "I love a cup of good drink, and I cannot forbear it." The
   glutton saith, "I love good cheer, and I cannot forbear." The
   fornicator saith, "I love to have my lust fulfilled, and I cannot
   forbear." And the gamester loves to have his sports, and he cannot
   forbear. So that they are become even captivated slaves to their flesh,
   and their very wilfulness is become an impotency; and what they would
   not do, they say they cannot. And the worldling is so taken up with
   earthly things, that he hath neither heart, nor mind, nor time, for
   heavenly; but, as in Pharaoh's dream, Gen. xli. 4. "The lean kine did
   eat up the fat ones," so this lean and barren earth doth eat up all the
   thoughts of Heaven.

   5. Some are so carried away by the stream of evil company, that they
   are possessed with hard thoughts of a godly life, by hearing them speak
   against it; or at least they think they may venture to do as they see
   most do, and so they hold on in their sinful ways; and when one is cut
   off and cast into hell, and another snatched away from among them to
   the same condemnation, it doth not much daunt them, because they see
   not whither they are gone. Poor wretches, they hold on in their
   ungodliness, for all this; for they little know that their companions
   are now lamenting it in torments. In Luke xvi. the rich man in hell
   would fain have had one to warn his five brethren, lest they should
   come to that place of torment. It is like, he knew their minds and
   lives, and knew that they were hastening thither, and little dreamed
   that he was there, yea, and would little have believed one that should
   have told them so. I remember a passage that a gentleman yet living
   told me that he saw upon a bridge over the Severn. [1] A man was
   driving a flock of fat lambs, and something meeting them, and hindering
   their passage, one of the lambs leaped upon the wall of the bridge,
   and, his legs slipping from under him, he fell into the stream; the
   rest seeing him, did one after one leap over the bridge, and were all,
   or almost all drowned.--Those that were behind did little know what was
   become of them that were gone before, but thought they might venture to
   follow their companions; but, as soon as ever they were over the wall,
   and falling headlong, the case was altered. Even so it is with
   unconverted carnal men. One dieth by them, and drops into hell, and
   another follows the same way; and yet they will go after them, because
   they think not whither they are gone. Oh but when death hath once
   opened their eyes, and they see what is on the other side of the wall,
   even in another world; then what would they give to be where they were!

   6. Moreover, they have a subtle malicious enemy, that is unseen of
   them, and plays his game in the dark; and it is his principal business
   to hinder their conversion, and therefore to keep them where they are,
   by persuading them not to believe the Scriptures, or not to trouble
   their minds with these matters; or by persuading them to think ill of a
   godly life, or to think that it more ado than needs, and that they may
   be saved without conversion, and without all this stir; and that God is
   so merciful that he will not damn any such as they; or at least, that
   they may stay a little longer, and take their pleasure, and follow the
   world a little longer yet, and then let it go, and repent hereafter:
   And by such deluding cheats as these, the devil keeps the most in his
   captivity, and leadeth them to his misery. These, and such like
   impediments as these, do keep so many thousands unconverted, when God
   hath done so much, and Christ hath suffered so much, and ministers have
   said so much for their conversion; when their reasons are silenced, and
   they are not able to answer the Lord that calls after them, "Turn ye,
   turn ye, why will ye die?" yet all comes to nothing with the greatest
   part of them; and they leave us no more to do, after all, but to sit
   down, and lament their wilful misery.

   Ezek. xxxiii. 11.

   Say to them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the
   death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.
   Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways, for, why will ye die, O house of
   Israel?

   I HAVE now shewn you the reasonableness of God's commands, and the
   unreasonableness of wicked men's disobedience. If nothing will serve
   their turn, but men will yet refuse to turn, we are next to consider
   who it is long of if they be damned. And this brings me to the last
   doctrine; which is,

   Doct. 7. That if, after all, these men will not turn, it is not the
   fault of God that they are condemned, but themselves, even their own
   wilfulness. They die, because they will die; that is, because they will
   not turn.

   If you will go to hell, what remedy? God here acquits himself of your
   blood; it shall not lie on him if you be lost. A negligent minister may
   draw it upon him; and those that encourage you, or hinder you not in
   sin, may draw it upon them; but be sure of it, it shall not lie upon
   God. Saith the Lord, concerning his unprofitable vineyard, Isaiah v. 2,
   3, 4. "Judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard, what could have
   been done more to my vineyard: that I have not done in it? When he had
   planted it in a fruitful soil, and fenced it, and gathered out the
   stones, and planted it with the choicest vines," what should he have
   done more to it? He hath made you men, and endowed you with reason; he
   hath furnished you with all external necessaries, he hath given you a
   righteous perfect law: When you had broken it, and undone yourselves,
   he had pity on you, and sent His Son by a miracle of condescending
   mercy to die for you, and be a sacrifice for your sins; and he "was in
   Christ reconciling the world to Himself." The Lord Jesus hath made you
   a deed of gift of himself, and eternal life with him, on the condition
   you will but accept it and return. He hath, on this reasonable
   condition, offered you the free pardon of all your sins; he hath
   written this in his word, and sealed it by his Spirit, and sent it by
   his ministers; they have made the offer to you, (many a time) and
   called you to accept it, and to turn to God. They have in his name
   intreated you, and reasoned the case with you, and answered all your
   frivolous objections. He hath long waited on you, and staid your
   leisure, and suffered you to abuse him to his face. He hath mercifully
   sustained you in the midst of your sins; he hath compassed you about
   with all sorts of mercies: he hath also intermixed afflictions to mind
   you of your folly, and call you to your wits; and his spirit hath been
   often striving with your hearts, and saying there, "Turn, sinner, turn
   to him that calleth thee: whither art thou going? What art thou doing?
   Dost thou know what will be the end? How long wilt thou hate thy
   friends, and love thine enemies? When will thou let go all, and turn,
   and deliver up thyself to God, and give thy Redeemer the possession of
   thy soul? When shall it once be?" These pleadings have been used with
   thee: And when thou hast delayed, thou hast been urged to make haste,
   and God hath called to thee, "To-day, while it is called to-day, harden
   not thy heart: Why not now without any more delay?" Life hath been set
   before you, the joys of heaven have been opened to you in the gospel;
   the certainty of them have been manifested; the certainty of the
   everlasting torments of the damned hath been declared to you. Unless
   you would have had a sight of heaven and hell, what could you desire
   more? Christ hath been, as it were, set forth crucified before your
   eyes, Gal. iii. 1. You have been a hundred times told that you are but
   lost men till you come unto him. As oft you have been told of the evil
   of sin, of the vanity of the world, and all the pleasures and wealth it
   can afford, or the shortness and uncertainty of your lives, and the
   endless duration of the joy or torment of the life to come. All this,
   and more than this, have you been told, and told again, even till you
   were weary of hearing it, and till you could make the lighter of it,
   because you had so often heard it, like the smith's dog, that is
   brought by custom to sleep under the noise of the hammers, and when the
   sparks do fly about his ears; and, though all this have not converted
   you, yet you are alive, and might have mercy to this day, if you had
   but hearts to entertain it. And, now let reason itself be the judge,
   whether it be long of God or you, if after this you will be unconverted
   and be damned? If you die now, it is because you will die. What should
   be said more to you? or what course should be taken that is more likely
   to prevail? Are you able to say, and make it good, "We would fain have
   been converted, and become new creatures, but we could not; we would
   fain have forsaken our sins, but could not; we would have changed our
   company, and our thoughts, and our discourse, but we could not."--Why
   could you not, if you would? What hindered you, but the wickedness of
   your hearts? Who forced you to sin? or who held you back from duty? Had
   not you the same teaching, and time, and liberty to be godly, as your
   godly neighbours had? Why then could not you have been godly as well as
   they? Were the church-doors shut against you? or did you not keep away
   yourselves? or sit and sleep, or hear as if you did not hear? Did God
   put in any exceptions against you in his word, when he invited sinners
   to return; and when he promised mercy to those that do return? Did he
   say, "I will pardon all that repent except thee?" Did he shut you out
   from the liberty of his holy worship? Did he forbid you to pray to him
   any more than others? You know he did not. God did not drive you away
   from him, but you forsook him, and ran away yourselves. And when he
   called you to him, you would not come.--If God had excepted you out of
   the general promise and offer of mercy, or had said to you, "Stand off;
   I will have nothing to do with such as you; pray not to me, for I will
   not hear you; if you repent never so much, and cry for mercy never so
   much, I will not regard you."--If God had left you nothing to trust to
   but desperation, then you had had a fair excuse. You might have said,
   "To what end do I repent and turn, when it will do no good?"--But this
   was not your case. You might have had Christ to be your Lord and
   Saviour, as well as others, and you would not; because you felt not
   yourselves sick enough for the physician, and because you could not
   spare your disease: In your hearts you said, as those rebels, Luke xix.
   14. "We will not have this man to reign over us" Christ "would have
   gathered you under the wings of his salvation, and you would not" Matt.
   xxiii. 37. What desires of your welfare did the Lord express in his
   holy word! With what compassion did he stand over you, and say, "O that
   my people had hearkened unto ne, and that they had walked in my ways!"
   Psalm lxxxi. 13. "O that there were such a heart in this people, that
   they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might
   be well with them and with their children for ever!" Deut. v. 20. "O
   that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would
   consider their latter end!" Deut. xxxiii. 29. He would have been your
   God, and done all for you that your souls could well desire; but you
   loved the world and your flesh above him, and therefore you would not
   hearken to him; though you complimented with him, and gave him high
   titles; yet, when it came to the closing, "you would have none of him"
   Psalm lxxxi. 11, 12. "No marvel, then, if he gave you up to your own
   lusts, and you walked in your own counsels."--He condescends to reason,
   and pleads the case with you, and asketh you, "What is there in me or
   my service, that you should be so much against me? What harm have I
   done thee, sinner? Have I deserved this unkind dealing at thy hand?
   Many mercies have I shewen thee; for which of them dost thou thus
   despise me? Is it I, or is it Satan, that is your enemy? Is it I, or is
   it thy carnal self that would undo thee? Is it a holy life, or a life
   of sin that thou hast cause to fly from? If thou be undone, thou
   procurest this to thyself, by forsaking me, the Lord, that would have
   saved thee," Jer. ii. 7. "Doeth not thy own wickedness correct thee,
   and thy sin reprove thee, that thou mayest see that it is an evil and
   bitter thing that thou hast forsaken me?" Jer. ii. 19. "What iniquity
   have you found in me, that you have followed after vanity, and forsaken
   me?" Jer. ii. 5, 6. He calleth out as it were to the brutes, to hear
   the controversy he hath against you. Micah vi. 3, 4, 5. "Hear, O ye
   mountains, the Lord's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the
   earth, for the Lord God hath a controversy with his people, and he will
   plead with Israel. O my people, what have I done unto thee, and wherein
   have I wearied thee? Testify against me, for I brought you up out of
   Egypt, and redeemed thee, &c." "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,
   for the Lord hath spoken it. I have nourished and brought up children,
   and they have rebelled against me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the
   ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not
   consider! Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
   evil doers, &c." Isaiah i. 2, 3, 4. "Do you thus requite the Lord, O
   foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy Father that bought thee? Hath
   he not made thee, and established thee?" Deut. xxii. 6. When he saw
   that you forsook him, even for nothing, and turned away from your Lord
   and life, to hunt after the chaff and feathers of the world, he told
   you of your folly, and called you to a more profitable employment,
   Isaiah lv. 1, 2, 3. "Wherefore do you spend your money for that which
   is not bread, and your labour for that which satisfieth not? Hearken
   diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul
   delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me: Hear,
   and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting covenant with
   you, even the sure mercies of David.--Seek ye the Lord while he may be
   found: Call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake his
   way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the
   Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will
   abundantly pardon," ver. 6, 7. and so Isaiah i. 16, 17, 18. And, when
   you would not hear, what complaints have you put him to, charging it on
   you as your wilfulness and stubbournness!--Jer. ii. 13. "Be astonished:
   O heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid!--For, my people have
   committed two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of living
   waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no
   water."--Many a time hath Christ proclaimed that free invitation to
   you, Rev. xxii. 17, "Let him that is athirst come; and whosoever will,
   let him take the water of life freely." But you put him to complain
   after all his offers: "They will not come to me, that they may have
   life" John v. 40. He hath invited you to feast with him in the kingdom
   of his grace, and you have had excuses from your grounds, and your
   cattle, and your worldly business; and, when you would not come, you
   have said you could not; and provoked him to resolve that you should
   never taste of his supper, Luke xiv. 15, 24. And who is it long of now
   but yourselves? and what can we say is the chief cause of your
   damnation, but your own wills? You will be damned. The whole case is
   laid open by Christ himself, Prov. i. from the 20th to the end, "Wisdom
   crieth without, she uttereth her voice in the streets, she crieth in
   the chief place of concourse: How long, ye simple ones, will you love
   simplicity, and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate
   knowledge? Turn ye at my reproof; behold I will pour out my spirit unto
   you, and I will make known my words unto you. Because I have called and
   ye refused, I have stretched out my hands, and no man regarded, but ye
   have set at nought all my counsel, would none of my reproofs; I also
   will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh, when
   your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a
   whirlwind. When distress and anguish come upon you, then shall they
   call on me, but I will not answer: They shall seek me early, but they
   shall not find me. For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose
   the fear of the Lord. They would none of my counsel; they despised all
   my reproof: Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and
   be filled with their own devices. For, the away of the simple shall
   slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But whoso
   hearkeneth to me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from the fear
   of evil."--I thought best to recite the whole text at large to you,
   because it doth so fully show the cause of the destruction of the
   wicked. It is not because God would not teach them, but because they
   would not learn. It is not because God would not call them, but because
   they would not turn at His reproof. Their wilfulness is their undoing.

   USE.

   From what has been said, you may farther learn these following things:

   1. From hence you may see, not only what blasphemy and impiety it is to
   lay the blame of men's destruction upon God, but also, how unfit these
   wicked wretches are to bring in such a charge against their Maker. They
   cry out upon God, and say, he gives them not grace, and his threatnings
   are severe, and God forbid that all should be damned that be not
   converted and sanctified: and they think it a hard measure that a short
   sin should have an endless suffering; and if they be damned they say
   they cannot help it; when in the mean time they are busy about their
   own destruction, even cutting the throat of their own souls, and will
   not be persuaded to hold their hands. They think God were cruel if he
   should damn them; and yet they are so cruel to themselves, that they
   will run into the fire of hell; when God hath told them it is a little
   before them, and neither intreaties, nor threatnings, nor any thing
   that can be said, will stop them. We see them almost undone; their
   careless, worldly, fleshly lives do tell us, that they are in the power
   of the devil; we know, if they die before they are converted, all the
   world cannot save them; and, knowing the uncertainty of their lives, we
   are afraid every day lest they drop into the fire. And, therefore, we
   intreat them to pity their own souls, and not to undo themselves when
   mercy is at hand, and they will not hear us. We intreat them to cast
   away their sin, and come to Christ without delay, and to have some
   mercy on themselves, but they will have none. And yet they think that
   God must be cruel if he condemn them. O wilful miserable sinners! It is
   not God that is cruel to you; it is you that are cruel to yourselves.
   You are told that you must turn or burn, and yet you turn not. You are
   told, that if you will needs keep your sins, you shall keep the curse
   of God with them, and yet you will keep them. You are told that there
   is no way to happiness but by holiness; and yet you will not be holy.
   What would you have God say more to you? What would you have him do
   with his mercy? He offereth it to you, and you will not have it. You
   are in the ditch of sin and misery, and he would give you his hand to
   help you out, and you refuse his help: he would cleanse you of your
   sins, and you had rather keep them. You love your lust, and love your
   gluttony, and sports, and drunkenness, and will not let them go. Would
   you have him bring you to heaven whether you will or not? Or would you
   have him bring you and your sins to heaven together? Why that is an
   impossibility: you may as well expect he should turn the sun into
   darkness. What! an unsanctified fleshly heart to be in heaven! it
   cannot be. "There entereth nothing that is unclean," Rev. xxi. 17. "For
   what communion hath light with darkness, or Christ with Belial?" 2 Cor.
   vi. 14, 15. "All the day long hath he stretched out his hands to a
   disobedient and gainsaying people," Rom. x. 25. What will you do now?
   Will you cry to God for mercy? Why God calleth upon you to have mercy
   upon yourselves, and you will not. Ministers see the poisoned cup in
   the drunkard's hand, and tell him, there is poison in it, and desire
   him to have mercy on his soul, and forbear; and he will not hear us:
   drink it he must and will; he loves it; and therefore, though hell come
   next, he saith he cannot help it. What should one say to such men as
   these? We tell the ungodly careless worldling, it is not such a life
   that will serve the turn, or ever bring you to heaven. If a bear were
   at your back, you would mend your pace, and, when the curse of God is
   at your back, and Satan and hell are at your back, will you not stir,
   but ask, What needs all this ado? Is an immortal soul of no more worth?
   Oh! have mercy upon yourselves! But they will have no mercy on
   themselves, nor once regard us. We tell them the end will be bitter.
   Who can dwell with the everlasting fire? And yet they will have no
   mercy on themselves. And yet will these poor wretches say, that God is
   more merciful than to condemn them, when it is themselves that cruelly
   and unmercifully run upon condemnation; and if we should go to them,
   and intreat them, we cannot stop them. If we should fall on our knees
   to them, we cannot stop them; but to hell they will go, and yet will
   not believe that they are going thither. If we beg of them for the sake
   of God that made them, and preserveth them; for the sake of Christ,
   that died for them; for the sake of their own poor souls, to pity
   themselves, and go no farther in the way to hell, but come to Christ
   while his arms are open, and enter into the state of life while the
   door stands open, and now take mercy while mercy may be had; they will
   not be persuaded. If we should die for it, we cannot so much as get
   them so much as now and then to consider with themselves of the matter,
   and turn. And yet they can say, "I hope God will be merciful." Did you
   never consider what he saith, Isaiah xxvii. 11. "It is a people of no
   understanding, therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them;
   and he that formed them will shew them no favour" If another man will
   not clothe you when you are naked, and feed you when you are hungry,
   you will say he is unmerciful. If he should cast you into prison, or
   beat and torment you, you would say he is unmerciful. And yet you will
   do a thousand times more against yourselves, even cast away both soul
   and body for ever, and never complain of your own unmercifulness! Yea,
   and God, that waited upon you all the while with his mercy, must be
   taken to be unmerciful, if he punish you after all this. Unless the
   Holy God of heaven will give these wretches leave to trample upon his
   Son's blood, and with the Jews, as it were, again to spit in his face,
   and do despite to the spirit of grace, and make a jest of sin, and a
   mock at holiness, and set more light by saving mercy than by the filth
   of their fleshly pleasures; and unless, after all this, He will save
   them by the mercy which they cast away, and would none of, God himself
   must be called unmerciful by them.--But he will be justified when he
   judgeth, and he will not stand or fall at the bar of a sinful worm.--I
   know there are many particular cavils that are brought by them against
   the Lord; but I shall not here stay to answer them particularly, having
   done it already in my Treatise of Judgment, to which I shall refer
   them. Had the disputing part of the world been as careful to avoid sin
   and destruction as they have been busy in searching after the cause of
   them, and forward directly to impute them to God, they might have
   exercised their wits more profitably, and have less wronged God, and
   sped better themselves. When so ugly a monster as sin is within us, and
   so heavy a thing as punishment is on us, and so dreadful a thing as
   hell is before us, one would think it would be an easy question, who is
   in the fault, whether God or man be the principal or culpable cause?
   Some men are such favourable judges of themselves, that they are proner
   to accuse the infinite perfection and goodness itself than their own
   hearts, and imitate their first parents, that said, "The serpent
   tempted me, and the woman that thou gavest me gave unto me, and I did
   eat;"--secretly implying that God was the cause. So say they, "the
   understanding that thou gavest me was unable to discern; the will that
   thou gavest me was unable to make a better choice; the objects which
   thou didst set before me did entice me; the temptation which thou didst
   permit to assault me prevailed against me." And some are so loathe to
   think that God can make a self-determinate creature, that they dare not
   deny him that which they take to be his prerogative to be the
   determiner of the will in every sin, as the first efficient immediate
   physical cause.--And many would be content to acquit God from so much
   causing of evil, if they could but reconcile it with his being the
   chief cause of good: as if truths would be no longer truths if we are
   unable to see them in their perfect order and coherence; because our
   raveled wits cannot see them right together, nor assign each truth its
   proper place, we presume to conclude that some must be cast away. This
   is the fruit of proud self-conceitedness; when men receive not God's
   truth as a child his lesson, in a holy submission to the omniscience of
   our teacher but as censurers that are too wise to learn.

   Objecti. But we cannot convert ourselves till God convert us: we can do
   nothing without his grace: It is not in him that willeth, nor in him
   that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercy.

   Answer. God hath two degrees of mercy to shew; the mercy of conversion
   first, and the mercy of salvation last: The latter he will give to none
   but those that will and run, and hath promised it to them only. The
   former is to make them willing that are unwilling; and though your own
   willingness and endeavours deserve not his grace, yet your wilful
   refusal deserveth that it should be denied to you. Your disability is
   your very unwillingness itself which excuseth not your sin, but maketh
   it the greater. You could turn if you were but truly willing; and, if
   your wills themselves are so corrupted, that nothing but effectual
   grace will move them, you have the more cause to seek for that grace,
   and yield to it, and do what you can in the use of means, and not
   neglect it, or set yourself against it. Do what you are able first, and
   then complain of God for denying you grace, if you have cause.

   Object. But you seem to intimate all this while that man hath free
   will.

   Ans. The dispute about free will is beyond your capacity; I shall
   therefore now trouble you with no more but this about it. Your will is
   naturally a free, that is, a self-determining faculty, but it is
   viciously inclined, and backward to do good; and therefore we see, by
   sad experience, that it hath not a virtuous moral freedom. But that it
   is the wickedness of it which deserveth the punishment. And I pray you
   let us not befool ourselves with opinions. Let the case be your own. If
   you had an enemy so malicious that he falls upon you, and beats you
   every time he meets you, and takes away the lives of your children,
   will you excuse him, because he saith, "I have not free-will, it is my
   nature; I cannot choose, unless God gives me grace." If you have a
   servant that robbeth you, will you take such an answer from him? Might
   not every thief and murderer, that is hanged at the assize, give such
   an answer? "I have not free will; I cannot change my own heart! What
   can I do without God's grace?" And shall they therefore be acquitted?
   If not, why then should you think to be acquitted for a course of sin
   against the Lord?

   2. From hence also you may observe these three things together: 1. What
   a subtle tempter Satan is. 2. What a deceitful thing sin is. 3. What a
   foolish creature corrupted man is. A subtile tempter indeed, that can
   persuade the greatest part of the world to go wilfully into everlasting
   fire, when they have so many warnings and dissuasives as they have. A
   deceitful thing is sin indeed, that can bewitch so many thousands to
   part with everlasting life, for a thing so base and utterly unworthy! A
   foolish creature is man indeed, that will be cheated of his salvation
   for nothing, yea, for a known nothing; and that by an enemy, and a
   known enemy. You would think it impossible that any man in his wits
   should be persuaded, for a trifle, to cast himself into the fire, or
   water, or into a coal-pit, to the destruction of his life. And yet men
   will be enticed to cast themselves into hell. If your natural lives
   were in your own hands, that you should not die till you should kill
   yourselves, how long would most of you live? And yet, when your
   everlasting life is so far in your own hands, under God, that you
   cannot be undone till you undo yourselves, how few of you will forbear
   your own undoing? Ah! what a silly thing is man! And what a bewitching
   and befooling thing is sin!

   3. From hence also you may learn, that it is no great wonder if wicked
   men be hinderers of others in the way to heaven, and would have as many
   unconverted as they can, and would draw them into sin and keep them in
   it! Can you expect that they should have mercy on others, that have
   none upon themselves? and that they should so much stick to the
   destruction of others, that stick not to destroy themselves? They do no
   worse by others than they do by themselves.

   4. Lastly, You may hence learn, that the greatest enemy to man is
   himself; and the greatest judgment in this life, that can befal him, is
   to be left to himself; that the great work that grace hath to do, is to
   save us from ourselves; that the greatest accusations and complaints of
   men should be against themselves; that the greatest work that we have
   to do ourselves, is to resist ourselves; and the greatest enemy that we
   should daily pray, and watch, and strive against, is our own carnal
   hearts and wills; and the greatest part of your work, if you will do
   good to others, and help them to heaven, is to save them from
   themselves, even from their blind understandings, and corrupted wills,
   and perverse affections, and violent passions, and unruly senses. I
   only name all these for brevity sake; and leave them to your farther
   consideration.

   WELL, Sirs, now we have found out the great delinquent and murderer of
   souls, (even men's selves, their own wills) what remains but that you
   judge according to the evidence, and confess this great iniquity before
   the Lord, and be humbled for it, and do so no more? To these three ends
   distinctly, I shall add a few words more.--1. Farther to convince you.
   2. To humble you. And 3. To reform you, if there yet be any hope.

   1. We know so much of the exceeding gracious nature or God, who is so
   willing to do good, and delighteth to shew mercy, that we have no
   reason to suspect him of being the culpable cause of our death, or to
   call him cruel: he hath made all good, and he preserveth and
   maintaineth all; the eyes of all things do wait upon him, and he giveth
   them their meat in due season; he openeth his hand, and satisfieth the
   desires of all the living, Psal. cxlv. 15, 16. He is not only
   "righteous in all his ways (and therefore will deal justly) and holy in
   all his works, (and therefore not the author of sin) but he is also
   good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works." Psal.
   cxlv. 17, 19. But as for man, we know his mind is dark, his will
   perverse, his affections carry him so headlong, that he is fitted by
   his folly and corruption to such a work as the destroying of himself.
   If you saw a lamb lie killed in the way, would you sooner suspect the
   sheep, or the wolf to be the author of it, if they both stand by? Or,
   if you see a house broken, and the people murdered, would you sooner
   suspect the prince, or judge, that is wise and just, and had no need;
   or a known thief or murderer? I say therefore as James i. 13, 14, 15.
   "Let no man say, when he is tempted, that he is tempted of God," for
   God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man, (to draw
   him to sin) but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own
   lust, and enticed. Then, when lust hath conceived, it brings forth sin;
   and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death. You see here that sin
   is the offspring of your own concupiscence, and not to be fathered on
   God; and that death is the offspring of your own sin, and the fruit
   which it will yield you as soon as ripe. You have a treasure of evil in
   yourselves, as a spider hath of poison, from whence you are bringing
   forth hurt to yourselves, and spinning such webs as entangle your own
   souls. Your nature shews it is you that are the cause.

   2. It is evident that you are your own destroyers, in that you are so
   ready to entertain any temptation almost that is offered you. Satan is
   scarce readier to move you to any evil than you are ready to hear and
   to do as he would have you. If he would tempt your understanding to
   error and prejudice, you yield. If he would hinder you from good
   resolutions, it is soon done. If he would cool any good desires or
   affections, it is soon done. If he would kindle any lust, or vile
   affections and desires in you, it is soon done. If he will put you on
   to evil thoughts, or deeds, you are so free, that he needs not rod or
   spur. If he would keep you from holy thoughts, and words, and ways, a
   little doth it, you need no curb. You examine not his suggestions, nor
   resist them with any resolution; nor cast them out as he casts them in,
   nor quench the sparks which he endeavoureth to kindle; but you set in
   with him, and meet him half-way, and embrace his notions, and tempt him
   to tempt you. And it is easy for him to catch such greedy fish that are
   ranging for a bait, and will take the bare hook.

   3. Your destruction is evidently of yourselves, in that you resist all
   that would help to save you, and would do you good, or hinder you from
   undoing yourselves. God would help and save you by his word, and you
   resist it; it is too strict for you. He would sanctify you by his
   Spirit, and you resist and quench it. If any man reprove you for your
   sin, you fly in his face with evil words; and if he would draw you to a
   holy life, and tell you of your present danger, you give him little
   thanks, but either bid him look to himself, he shall not answer for
   you; or else, at best, you put him off with heartless thank, and will
   not turn when you are persuaded. If ministers would privately instruct
   and help you, you will not come to them; your unhumbled souls do feel
   but little need of their help; if they would catechise you, you are too
   old to be catechised, though you are not too old to be ignorant and
   unholy. Whatever they can say to you for your good, you are so
   self-conceited and wise in your own eyes, (even in the depth of
   ignorance) that you will regard nothing that agreeth not with your
   present conceits; but contradict your teachers, as if you were wiser
   than they; you resist all that they can say to you, by your ignorance,
   unwilfulness, and foolish cavils, and shifting evasions, and unthankful
   rejections; so that no good that is offered can find any welcome
   acceptance and entertainment with you.

   4. Moreover, it is apparent that you are self-destroyers, in that you
   draw the matter of your sin and destruction even from the blessed God
   himself. You like not the contrivance of his wisdom; you like not his
   justice, but take it for cruelty; you like not his holiness, but are
   ready to think he is such a one as yourselves, Psalm i. 21. and make as
   light of sin as you do; you like not his truth, but would have his
   threatnings, even his peremptory threatnings prove false. And his
   goodness, which you seem most highly to approve, you partly resist, as
   it would lead you to repentance; and partly abuse, to the strengthening
   of your sin, as if you might freely sin because God is merciful, and
   because his grace doth so much abound.

   5. Yea, you fetch destruction from the blessed Redeemer, and death from
   the Lord of life himself! And nothing more emboldeneth you in sin, than
   that Christ hath died for you; as if now the danger of death were over,
   and you might boldly venture: As if Christ were become a servant to
   Satan and your sins, and must wait upon you while you are abusing him;
   and because he is become the physician of souls, and is able to save to
   the utmost all that come to God by him, you think he must suffer you to
   refuse his help, and throw away medicines, and must save you whether
   you will come to God by him or not; so that a great part of your sins
   are occasioned by your bold presumption upon the death of Christ; not
   considering that he came to redeem his people from their sins, and to
   sanctify them a peculiar people to himself, and to confirm them in
   holiness to the image of their heavenly Father, and to their head.
   Matt. i. 21. Tit. ii. 14. 1 Pet. i. 15, 16.--Col. iii. 10, 11. Phil.
   iii. 9, 10.

   6. You also fetch your own destruction from all the providences and
   works of God. When you think of his eternal fore-knowledge and decrees,
   it is to harden you in your sin, or possess your minds with quarrelling
   thoughts, as if his decrees might spare you the labour of repentance
   and a holy life, or else were the cause of sin and death. If he afflict
   you, you repine; if he prosper you, you the more forget him, and are
   the more backwards to the thoughts of the life to come. If the wicked
   prosper, you forget the end that will set all reckonings strait; and
   are ready to think it is as good to be wicked as godly; and thus you
   draw your death from all.

   7. And the like you do from all the creatures and mercies of God to
   you. He giveth them to you as the tokens of his love, and furniture for
   his service, and you turn them against him, to the pleasing of your
   flesh. You eat and drink to please your appetite, and not for the glory
   of God, and to enable you to perform his work. Your clothes you abuse
   to pride. Your riches draw your hearts from heaven, Phil. iii. 18. Your
   honours and applause do puff you up. If you have wealth and strength,
   it makes you more secure, and forget your end. Yea, other men's mercies
   are abused by you to your hurt. If you see their honours and dignity,
   you are provoked to envy them. If you see their riches, you are ready
   to covet them. If you look upon beauty, you are stirred up to lust. And
   it is well if godliness itself be not an eye sore to you.

   8. The very gifts that God bestoweth on you, and the ordinances of
   grace which he hath instituted for his church, you turn to sin. If you
   have better parts than others, you grow proud and self-conceited. If
   you have but common gifts, you take them for special grace. You take
   the bare hearing of your duty for so good a work, as if it would excuse
   you for not obeying it. Your prayers are turned into sin, because you
   regard iniquity in your hearts, Psa. lxvi. 18. "And depart not from
   iniquity when you call on the name of the Lord," 2 Tim. ii. 19. "Your
   prayers are abominable, because you turn away your ear from hearing the
   law," Prov. xxviii. 9. and are more ready to offer the sacrifice or
   fools (thinking you do God some special service) than to hear his word
   and obey it,"Eccles. v. 1.

   9. Yea, the persons that you converse with, and all their actions, you
   make the occasions of your sin and destruction. If they live in the
   fear of God, you hate them.--If they live ungodly, you imitate them. If
   the wicked are many, you think you may the more boldly follow them. If
   the godly be few, you are the more emboldened to despise them. If they
   walk exactly, you think they are too precise: if one of them fall in a
   particular temptation, you stumble upon them, and turn away from
   holiness, because that others are imperfectly holy; as if you were
   warranted to break your necks, because some others have by heedlessness
   sprained a sinew or put out a bone. If a hypocrite discover himself,
   you say, they are all alike, and think yourselves as honest. A
   professor can scarce slip into any miscarriage, but, because he cuts
   his finger, you think you may boldly cut your throats. If ministers
   deal plainly with you, you say they rail. If they speak gently or
   coldly, you either sleep under them, or are little more affected than
   the seats you sit upon. If any errors creep into the church, some
   greedily entertain them, and others reproach the Christian doctrine for
   them, which is most against them. And if we would draw you from any
   ancient rooted error, which can but plead two, or three, or six, or
   seven hundred years custom, you are as much offended with a motion for
   reformation as if you were to lose your life by it, and hold fast old
   errors, while you cry out against new ones. Scarce a difference can
   arise among the ministers of the gospel, but you will fetch your own
   death from it. And you will not hear, or at least not obey, the
   unquestionable doctrine of any of those that jump not with your
   conceits. One will not hear a minister because he saith the Lord's
   prayer; and another will not hear him because he doth not use it. One
   will not hear them that are for Episcopacy; and another will not hear
   them that are against it. And, thus I might shew it you in many other
   cases, how you turn all that come near you to your own destruction; so
   clear is it that the ungodly are self-destroyers, and that their
   perdition is of themselves.

   Methinks now, upon the consideration of what is said, and the review of
   your own ways, you should bethink you what you have done, and be
   ashamed and deeply humbled to remember it. If you be not, I pray you
   consider these following truths:

   1. To be your own destroyers is to sin against the deepest principle in
   your natures, even the principle of self-preservation. Every thing
   naturally desireth or inclineth to its own felicity, welfare, or
   perfection. And will you set yourselves to your own destruction? When
   you are commanded to love your neighbours as yourselves, it is supposed
   that you naturally love yourselves. But if you love your neighbours no
   better than yourselves, it seems you would have all the world be
   damned.

   2. How extremely do you cross your own intentions! I know you intend
   not your own damnation, even when you are procuring it. You think you
   are but doing good to yourselves, by gratifying the desires of your
   flesh: but, alas! it is but as a draught of cold water in a burning
   fever, or as the scratching of an itching wild-fire, which increaseth
   the disease and pain. If indeed you would have pleasure, or profit, or
   honour, seek them where they are to be found, and do not hunt after
   them in the way to hell.

   3. What pity is it, that you should do that against yourselves which
   none else on earth or in hell can do! If all the world were combined
   against you, or all the devils in hell were combined against you, they
   could not destroy you without yourselves, nor make you sin but by your
   own consent. And will you do that against yourselves which no one else
   can do? You have hateful thoughts of the devil, because he is your
   enemy, and endeavoureth your destruction. And will you be worse than
   devils to yourselves? Why thus it is with you, if you had hearts to
   understand it, when you run into sin, and run from godliness, and
   refuse to turn at the call of God, you do more against your own souls
   than men or devils could do besides. And, if you should set yourselves
   and bend your wits to do yourselves the greatest mischief, you could
   not devise to do a greater.

   4. You are false to the trust that God hath reposed in you. He hath
   much entrusted you with your own salvation; and will you betray your
   trust? He hath set you with all diligence to keep your hearts; and is
   this the keeping of them? Prov. iv. 23.

   5. You do even forbid all others to pity you when you will have no pity
   on yourselves.--If you cry to God in the day of your calamity, for
   mercy, mercy; what can you expect, but that he should thrust you away,
   and say, "Nay, thou wouldst not have mercy on thyself: Who brought this
   upon thee but thy own wilfulness?" And if your brethren see you
   everlastingly in misery, how shall they pity you, that were your own
   destroyers, and would not be dissuaded?

   6. It will everlastingly make you your own tormentors in hell to think
   on it, that you brought yourselves wilfully to that misery. O what a
   torturing thought it will be for ever to think with yourselves that
   this was your own doing!--That you were warned of this day, and warned
   again, but it would not do! That you wilfully sinned, and wilfully
   turned away from God! That you had time as well as others, but you
   abused it! That you had teachers as well as others, but you refused
   their instructions! You had holy examples, but you did not imitate
   them. You were offered Christ, and grace, and glory, as well as others;
   but you had more mind of your fleshly pleasure. You had a price in your
   hands, but you had not a heart to lay it out, Prov. xvii. 16.--Can it
   chuse but torment you to think of this your present folly? O that your
   eyes were open to see what you have done in the wilful wronging of your
   own souls! and that you better understood these words of God, Prov.
   viii. 33, 34, 35, 36. "Hear instruction and be wise, and refuse it not:
   Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting
   at the posts of my doors: For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall
   obtain the favour of the Lord: But he that sinneth against me wrongeth
   his own soul: All they that hate me love death."

   And now I am come to the conclusion of this work, my heart is troubled
   to think how I shall leave, lest after this the flesh should still
   deceive you, and the world and the devil should keep you asleep, and I
   should leave you as I found you, till you awake in hell: Though in care
   of your poor souls, I am afraid of this, as knowing the obstinacy of a
   carnal heart: yet I can say with the prophet Jeremiah, xvii. 16. "I
   have not desired the woeful day, the Lord knoweth:" I have not, with
   James and John, desired that "fire might come from heaven" to consume
   them that refused Jesus Christ, (Luke ix. 54). but it is the preventing
   of the eternal fire that I have been all this while endeavouring! And O
   that it had been a needless work! That God and conscience might have
   been as willing to spare me this labour as some of you could have
   been!--Dear friends! I am so loathe that you should die in everlasting
   fire, and be shut out of heaven, if it be possible to prevent it, that
   I shall once more ask you, what do you now resolve? Will you turn, or
   die? I look upon you as a physician on his patient, in a dangerous
   disease, that says to him, "Though you are far gone, take but this
   medicine, and forbear but these few things that are hurtful to you, and
   I dare warrant your life: but if you will not do this, you are but a
   dead man."--What would you think of such a man, if the physician, and
   all the friends he hath, cannot persuade him to take one medicine to
   save his life, or to forbear one or two poisonous things that would
   kill him?--This is your case. As far as you are gone in sin, do but now
   turn and come to Christ, and take his remedies, and your sou1s shall
   live: Cast up your deadly sins by repentance, and turn not to the
   poisonous vomit any more, and you shall do well. But yet, if it were
   your bodies that we had to deal with, we might partly know what to do
   for you: Though you would not consent, yet you might be held or bound,
   while the medicine were poured down your throats, and hurtful things
   might be kept from you: But about your souls it cannot be so; we cannot
   convert you against your wills: There is no carrying madmen to heaven
   in fetters; you may be condemned against your wills, because you sinned
   with your wills; but you cannot be saved against your wills. The wisdom
   of God hath thought meet to lay men's salvation or destruction
   exceedingly much upon the choice of their own wills; that no man shall
   come to heaven, that chose not the way to heaven, and no man shall come
   to hell, but shall be forced to say, "I have the thing I chose, my own
   will did bring me hither."--Now, if I could but get you to be willing,
   to be thoroughly, and resolvedly, and habitually willing, the work were
   more than half done.--And alas! must we lose our friends, and must they
   lose their God, their happiness, their souls, for want of this? Oh! God
   forbid! It is a strange thing to me, that men are so inhuman and stupid
   in the greatest matters, that in less things are very civil and
   courteous, and good neighbours. For ought I know, I have the love of
   all, or almost all my neighbours, so far, that if I should send to any
   man in the town, or parish, or country, and request a reasonable
   courtesy of them, they would grant it me; and when I come to request of
   them the greatest matter in the world, for themselves, and not for me,
   I can have nothing of many of them but a patient hearing. I know not
   whether people think a man in the pulpit is in good sadness or not, and
   means as he speaks; for I think I have few neighbours, but, if I were
   sitting familiarly with them, and telling them what I have seen, or
   done, or known in the world, they would believe me, and regard what I
   say: But when I tell them, from the infallible word of God, what they
   themselves shall see and know in the world to come, they shew by their
   lives that they do either not believe it, or not much regard it. If I
   met ever a one of them on the way, and told them, yonder is a coal-pit,
   or there is a quicksand, or there are thieves lie in wait for you, I
   could persuade them to turn by: But when I tell them that Satan lieth
   in wait for them, and that sin is poison to them, and that hell is not
   a matter to be jested with, they go on as if they did not hear
   me.--Truly, neighbours, I am in as good earnest with you in the pulpit
   as I am in any familiar discourse, and, if ever you will regard me, I
   beseech you let it be here. I think there is never a man of you all,
   but, if my own soul lay at your wills, you would be willing to save it,
   (though I cannot promise that you would leave your sins for it.) If I
   come hungry or naked to one of your doors, would you not part with more
   than a cup of drink to relieve me? I am confident you would; if it were
   to save my life, I know you would (some of you) hazard your own. And
   yet, will you not be intreated to part with your sensual pleasures for
   your own salvation? I profess to you, Sirs, I am as hearty a beggar
   with you this day, for the saving of your own souls, as I would be for
   my own supply, if I were forced to come begging to your own doors. And,
   therefore, if you would hear me then, hear me now: if you would pity me
   then, be intreated now to pity yourselves. I do again beseech you, as
   if it were on my bended knees, that you would hearken to your Redeemer,
   and turn, that you may live.--All you that have lived in ignorance,
   carelessness, and presumption, to this day; all you that have been
   drowned in the cares of the world, and have no mind of God and eternal
   glory; all you that are enslaved to your fleshly desires of meats and
   drink, sports and lusts; and all you that know not the necessity of
   holiness, and never were acquainted with the sanctifying work of the
   Holy Ghost upon your souls; that never embraced your blessed Redeemer
   by a lively faith, and with admiring and thankful apprehensions of his
   love; and that never felt a higher estimation of God and heaven, and
   heartier love to them, than your fleshly prosperity, and the things
   below: I earnestly beseech you, not only for my sake, but for the
   Lord's sake, and for your souls' sake, that you go not one day longer
   in your former condition, but look about you, and cry to God for
   converting grace, that you may be made new creatures, and may escape
   the plagues that are a little before you. And if ever you will do
   anything for me, grant me this request, to turn from your evil ways and
   live. Deny me anything that ever I shall ask you for myself, if you
   will but grant me this. And if you deny me this, I care not for any
   thing else that you would grant me. Nay, as ever you will do any thing
   at the request of the Lord that made you and redeemed you, deny him not
   this; for if you deny him this, he cares for nothing that you shall
   grant him. As ever you would have him hear your prayers, and grant your
   requests, and do for you at the hour of death and day of judgment, or
   in any of your extremities, deny not his request now in the day of your
   prosperity. O believe it, death and judgment, and heaven and hell, are
   other matters when you come near them, than they seem to carnal eyes
   afar off.--Well tho' I cannot hope so well of all, I will hope that
   some of you are by this time purposing to turn and live, and that you
   are ready to say, "God forbid that we should choose destruction by
   refusing conversion, as hitherto we have done."

   If these be the thoughts and purposes of your hearts, I shall gladly
   give you direction what to do, and that but briefly, that you may the
   easier remember it for your practice.

   DIRECTION I

   IF you will be converted and saved, labour to understand the necessity
   and true nature of conversion; for what, and from what, and to what,
   and by what, it is that you must turn. Consider in what a lamentable
   condition you are till the hour of your conversion, that you may feel
   it is not a state to be rested in. You are under the guilt of all the
   sins that ever you committed; and under the wrath of God, and the curse
   of his law; you are bond-slaves to the devil, and daily employed in his
   work against the Lord, yourselves, and others; you are spiritually dead
   and deformed, as being void of the holy life, and nature, and image of
   the Lord. You are unfit for any holy work, and do nothing that is truly
   pleasing unto God. You are without any promise or assurance of his
   protection, and live in continual danger of his justice, not knowing
   what hour you may be snatched away to hell, and most certain to be
   damned if you die in that condition. And nothing short of conversion
   can prevent it. Whatever civilities, or amendments, or virtues, are
   short of true conversion, will never procure the saving of your souls.
   Keep the true sense of this natural misery, and so of the necessity of
   conversion on your hearts.

   And then you must understand what it is to be converted: it is to have
   a new heart or disposition, and a new conversation.

   Quest. 1. For what must we turn?

   Ans. For these ends following, which you may attain: 1. You shall
   immediately be made living members of Christ, and have an interest in
   him, and be renewed after the image of God, and be adorned with all his
   graces, and quickened with a new and heavenly life, and saved from the
   tyranny of Satan and the dominion of sin, and be justified from the
   curse of the law, and have the pardon of all the sins of your whole
   lives, and be accepted of God, and made his sons, and have liberty to
   call Him Father, and go to him by prayer, in all your needs, with a
   promise of acceptance; you shall have the Holy Ghost to dwell in you,
   to sanctify and guide you; you shall have part in the brotherhood,
   communion, and prayers of the saints; you shall be fitted for God's
   service, and be freed from the dominion of sin, and be useful and a
   blessing to the place where you live, and shall have the promise of
   this life, and that which is to come. You shall want nothing that is
   truly good for you, and your necessary afflictions you will be enabled
   to bear; you may have some taste of communion with God in the spirit,
   especially in all holy ordinances, where God prepareth a feast for your
   souls; you shall be heirs of heaven while you live on earth, and may
   foresee by faith the everlasting glory, and so may live and die in
   peace; and you shall never be so low, but your happiness will be
   incomparably greater than your misery.--How precious is every one of
   these blessings, which I do but briefly name, and which in this life
   you may receive.

   And then, 2. At death your souls shall go to Christ, and at the day of
   judgment both soul and body shall be justified and glorified, and enter
   into your Master's joy; where your happiness will consist in these
   particulars:

   1. You shall be perfected yourselves:--Your mortal bodies shall be made
   immortal, and the corruptible shall put on incorruption: You shall no
   more be hungry, or thirsty, or weary, or sick; nor shall you need to
   fear either shame, or sorrow, or death, or hell. Your souls shall be
   perfectly freed from sin, and perfectly fitted for the knowledge, and
   love, and praises of the Lord.

   2. Your employments shall be to behold your glorious Redeemer, with all
   your holy fellow-citizens of heaven; and to see the glory of the most
   blessed God, and to love him perfectly, and be beloved by him, and to
   praise him everlastingly.

   3. Your glory will contribute to the glory of the New Jerusalem, the
   city of the living God; which is more than to have a private felicity
   to yourselves.

   4. Your glory will contribute to the glorifying of your Redeemer, who
   will everlastingly be magnified and pleased in you that are the travail
   of his soul; and this is more than the glorifying of yourselves.

   5. And the eternal Majesty, the living God, will be glorified in your
   glory; both as he is magnified by your praises, and as he communicateth
   of his glory and goodness to you, and as he is pleased in you, and in
   the accomplishment of his glorious work, in the glory of the New
   Jerusalem, and of His Son. All this, the poorest beggar of you, that is
   converted, shall certainly and endlessly enjoy.

   2. You see for what you must turn: next you must understand from what
   you must turn: And that is, in a word, from your carnal self, which is
   the end of all the unconverted. From the flesh that would be pleased
   before God, and would still be enticing you; from the world, that is
   the bait; and from the devil, that is the angler for souls, and the
   deceiver. And so from all known and wilful sins.

   3. Next you must know to what end you must turn: and that is, to God as
   your end, to Christ as the way to the Father; to holiness, as the way
   appointed you by Christ; and to the use of all the helps and means of
   grace afforded you by the Lord.

   4. Lastly; you must know by what you must turn: And that is, by Christ,
   as the only Redeemer and Intercessor; and by the Holy Ghost, as the
   sanctifier; and by the Word, as his instrument or means; and by faith
   and repentance, as the means and duties on your part to be performed.
   All this is of necessity.

   Direct. II. If you will be converted and saved, be much in secret
   serious consideration. Inconsiderateness undoes the world. Withdraw
   yourselves often into retired secrecy, and there bethink you of the end
   why you were made; of the life you have lived; the time you have lost;
   the sin you have committed; of the love and sufferings, and fulness of
   Christ; of the danger you are in; of the nearness of death and
   judgment; of the certainty and excellency of the joys of heaven; and of
   the certainty and terror of the torments of hell; and eternity of both;
   and of the necessity of conversion and a holy life. Steep your hearts
   in such considerations as these.

   Direct. III If you will be converted and saved, attend upon the word of
   God, which is the ordinary means. Read the scripture, or hear it read,
   and other holy writings that do apply it: Constantly attend on the
   public preaching of the word. As God will lighten the world by the sun,
   and not by himself alone without it, so will he convert and save men by
   his ministers, who are the lights of the world, Acts xxvi. 17, 18.
   Matt. v. 14. When he had miraculously humbled Paul, he sendeth him to
   Ananias, Acts ix. 10. And when he hath sent an angel to Cornelius, it
   was but to bid him send for Peter, who is to tell him what he is to
   believe and do.

   Direct. IV. "Betake yourselves to God in a course of earnest constant
   prayer. Confess and lament your former lives, and beg his grace to
   illuminate and convert you. Beseech him to pardon what is past, and to
   give you his Spirit, and change your hearts and lives, and lead you in
   his ways, and save you from temptations." And ply this work daily, and
   be not weary of it.

   Direct. V. "Presently give over your known and wilful sins. Make a
   stand, and go that way no farther."--Be drunk no more, but avoid the
   place and occasion of it. Cast away your lusts and sinful pleasures
   with detestation, and rail no more; and, if you have wronged any,
   restore as Zaccheus did. If you will commit again your old sins, what
   blessings can you expect on the means for conversion?

   Direct. VI. "Presently, if possible, change your company, if it have
   hitherto been bad." Not by forsaking your necessary relations, but your
   unnecessary sinful companions, and join yourselves with those that fear
   the Lord, and inquire of them the way to heaven. Acts ix. 19, 26. Psalm
   xv. 4.

   Direct. VII. "Deliver up yourselves to the Lord Jesus as the physician
   of your souls," that he may pardon you by his blood, and sanctify you
   by his Spirit, by his word and ministers, the instruments of the
   Spirit. He is the way, the truth, and the life; there is no coming to
   the Father but by him, John xiv. 6. "Nor is there any other name under
   heaven by which you can be saved," Acts iv. 12. Study therefore His
   person and nature, and what he hath done and suffered for you, and what
   he is to you, and what he will be, and how he is fitted to the full
   supply of all your necessities.

   Direct. VIII. If you mean indeed to turn and live, "Do it speedily,
   without delay". If you be not willing to turn to-day, you are not
   willing to do it at all.--Remember you are all this while in your
   blood, under the guilt of many thousand sins, and under God's wrath,
   and you stand at the very brink of hell; there is but a step between
   you and death. And this is not a case for a man that is well in his
   wits to be quiet in. Up therefore presently, and fly as for your lives;
   as you would be gone out of your house, if it were all on fire over
   your heads.--O if you did but know in what continual danger you live
   in, and what daily unspeakable loss you do sustain, and what a safer
   and sweeter life you might live, you would not stand trifling, but
   presently turn. Multitudes miscarry that wilfully delay, when they are
   convinced that it must be done. Your lives are short and uncertain;
   and, what a case are ye in, if you die before you thoroughly turn! You
   have staid too long already, and wronged God too long; sin getteth
   strength and rooting while you delay. Your conversion will grow more
   hard and doubtful. You have much to do, and therefore put not all off
   to the last, lest God forsake you, and give you up to yourselves, and
   then you are undone for ever.

   Direct. IX. If you will turn and live, do it "unreservedly, absolutely,
   and universally." Think not to capitulate with Christ, and divide your
   heart betwix him and the world, and to part with some sins, and keep
   the rest; and to let that go that which your flesh can spare. This is
   but self-deluding; you must in heart and resolution forsake all that
   you have, or else you cannot be his disciples, Luke xiv. 26, 33. If you
   will not take God and heaven for your portion, and lay all below at the
   feet of Christ, but you must needs also have your good things here, and
   have an earthly portion, and God and glory are not enough for you, it
   is in vain to dream of salvation on these terms, for it will not be. If
   you seem never so religious, if yet it is but a carnal righteousness,
   and the flesh's prosperity, or pleasure, or safety, be still excepted
   in your devotedness to God, this is as certain a way to death as open
   profaneness, tho' it may be more plausible.

   Direct. X. If you will turn and live, do it "resolvedly," and stand not
   still deliberating, as if it were a doubtful case. Stand not wavering,
   as if you were yet uncertain whether God or the flesh be the better
   master; or whether heaven or hell be the better end; or whether sin or
   holiness is the better way. But away with your former lusts, and
   presently, habitually, fixedly resolve. Be not one day of one mind, and
   the next day of another; but be at a point with all the world, and
   resolvedly give up yourselves, and all you have to God. Now while you
   are reading, or hearing this, resolve. Before you sleep another night,
   resolve. Before you stir from the place, resolve. Before Satan have
   time to take you off, resolve. You never turn indeed till you do
   resolve, and that with a firm unchangeable resolution.--So much for the
   Directions.

   And now I have done my part in this work, that you may turn to the call
   of God, and live; what will become of it, I cannot tell: I have cast
   the seed at God's command, but it is not in my power to give the
   increase. I can go no farther with my message: I cannot bring it to
   your hearts, nor make it work; I cannot do your parts for you to
   entertain it and consider it; I cannot do God's part, by opening your
   heart to cause you to entertain it; nor can I shew heaven or hell to
   your eye-sight, nor give you new and tender hearts. If I knew what more
   to do for your conversion, I hope I should do it.

   But O thou, that art the gracious Father of spirits, thou hast sworn
   thou delightest not in the death of the wicked, but rather that they
   may turn and live; deny not thy blessing to those persuasions and
   directions, and suffer not thine enemies to triumph in thy sight; and
   the great deceiver of souls to prevail against thy Son, thy Spirit, and
   thy Word! O pity poor unconverted sinners, that have no hearts to pity
   themselves: Command the blind to see, and the deaf to hear, and the
   dead to live, and let not sin and death be able to resist thee.--Awaken
   the secure, resolve the unresolved, confirm the wavering, and let the
   eyes of sinners, that read these lines, be next employed in weeping
   over their sins; and bring them to themselves and to thy Son, before
   their sins have brought them to perdition. If thou sayst but the word,
   these poor endeavours shall prosper to the winning of many a soul, to
   their everlasting joy, and everlasting glory. Amen.

  THE END.
