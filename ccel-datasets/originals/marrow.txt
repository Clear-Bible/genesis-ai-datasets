RECOMMENDATIONS.

   I have perused this ensuing Dialogue, and find it tending to peace and
   holiness; the author endeavouring to reconcile and heal those unhappy
   differences, which have lately broken out afresh amongst us, about the
   points therein handled and cleared; for which cause I allow it to be
   printed, and recommend it to the reader, as a discourse stored with
   many necessary and seasonable truths, confirmed by Scripture, and
   avowed by many approved writers: all composed in a familiar, plain,
   moderate style, without bitterness against, or uncomely reflections
   upon others,--which flies have lately corrupted many boxes of otherwise
   precious ointment. May 1, 1645. JOS. CARYL.

   The marrow of the second bone is like that of the first, sweet and
   good. The commandments of God are marrow to the saints, as well as the
   promises; and they shall never taste the marrow of the promise who
   distaste the commandments. This little treatise breaketh the bone, the
   hard part of commandments, by a plain exposition, that so all, even
   babes in Christ, yea, such as are yet out of Christ, may suck out and
   feed upon the marrow by profitable meditation. Sept. 6, 1648. JOS.
   CARYL.

   If thou wilt please to peruse this little book, thou shalt find great
   worth in it. There is a line of a gracious spirit drawn through it,
   which has fastened many precious truths together, and presented them to
   thy view: according to the variety of men's spirits, the various ways
   of presenting known truths are profitable. The grace of God has helped
   this author in making his work. If it in like manner help thee in
   reading, thou shalt have cause to bless God for these truths thus
   brought to thee, and for the labours of this good man, whose ends, I
   believe, are very sincere for God and thy good. JER. BURROUGHS.

   Occasionally lighting upon the dialogue, under the approbation of a
   learned and judicious divine, I was thereby induced to read it, and
   afterwards, on a serious consideration of the usefulness of it, to
   commend it to the people in my public ministry.

   Two things in it especially took with me: First, The matter; the main
   substance being distinctly to discover the nature of the two covenants,
   upon which all the mysteries, both of the law and gospel, depend. To
   see the first Adam to be primus federatus in the one, and the second
   Adam in the other: to distinguish rightly betwixt the law standing
   alone as a covenant, and standing in subordination to the gospel as a
   servant: this I assure myself to be the key which opens the hidden
   treasure of the gospel. As soon as God had given Luther but a glimpse
   hereof, he professes that he seemed to be brought into paradise again,
   and the whole face of the Scripture to be changed to him: and he looked
   upon every truth with another eye.

   Secondly, The manner; because it is an irenicum, and tends to an
   accommodation and a right understanding. Times of reformation have
   always been times of division. Satan will cast out a flood after the
   woman, as knowing that more die by the disagreement of the humours of
   their own bodies, than by the sword; and that, if men be once engaged,
   they will contend, if not for truth, yet for victory.

   Now, if the difference be in things of lesser consequence, the best way
   to quench it were silence. But if the difference be of greater
   concernment than this is, the best way to decide it, is to bring in
   more light, which this author has done with much evidence of Scripture,
   backed with the authority of most modern divines. So that whosoever
   desires to have his judgment cleared in the main controversy between us
   and the Antinomians, with a small expense, either of money or time, he
   may here receive ample satisfaction. This I testify upon request,
   professing myself a friend both to truth and peace. W. STRONG.

   This book, at first well accommodated with so valuable a testimony as
   Mr. Caryl's, besides its better approving itself to the choicer spirits
   every where, by the speedy distribution of the whole impression; it
   might seem a needless or superfluous thing to add any more to the
   praise thereof; yet meeting with detracting language from some few, by
   reason of some phrases, by them either not duly pondered, or not
   rightly understood, it is thought meet, in this second impression, to
   relieve that worthy testimony, which still stands to it, with fresh
   supplies, not for any need the truth therein contained hath thereof,
   but because either the prejudice or darkness of some men's judgments
   does require it. I, therefore, having thoroughly perused it, cannot but
   testify, that if I have any the least judgment, or relish of truth, he
   that finds this book finds a good thing, and not unworthy of its title;
   and may account the saints to have obtained favour with the Lord in the
   ministration of it, as that which, with great plainness and evidence of
   truth, comprises the chief, if not all the differences that have been
   lately engendered about the law. It has, I must confess, not only
   fortified my judgment, but also warmed my heart in the reading of it;
   as indeed inculcating, throughout the whole dialogue, the clear and
   familiar notion of those things by which we live, as Ezekiel 16 speaks
   in another case; and it appears to me to be written from much
   experimental knowledge of Christ, and teaching of the Spirit. Let all
   men that taste the fruit of it confess, to the glory of God, he is no
   respecter of persons; and endeavour to know no man henceforth after the
   flesh, nor envy the compiler thereof the honour to be accounted, as God
   has made him in this point, a healer of breaches, and a restorer of the
   overgrown paths of the gospel. As for my own part, I am so satisfied in
   this testimony I lend, that I reckon whatever credit is thus pawned,
   will be a glory to the name that stands by and avows this truth, so
   long as the book shall endure to record it. JOSHUA SPRIGGE.

   I have, according to your desire, read over your book, and find it full
   of evangelical light and life; and I doubt not but the oftener I read
   it, the more true comfort I shall find in the knowledge of Christ
   thereby; the matter is pure, the method is apostolical, wherein the
   works of love, in the right place, after the life of faith, be
   effectually required. God has endowed his Fisher with the net of a
   trying understanding, and discerning judgment and judgment and
   discretion, whereby, out of the christaline streams of the well of
   life, you have taken a mess of the sweetest and wholesome fish that the
   world can afford, which, if I could daily have enough of, I should not
   care for the flesh, or the works thereof. SAMUEL PRETTIE.

   This book came into my hand by a merciful and most unexpected disposure
   of providence, and I read it with great and sweet complacence. It
   contains a great deal of the marrow of revealed and gospel truth,
   selected from authors of great note, clearly enlightened, and of most
   digested experience; and some of them were honoured to do eminent and
   heroical services in their day. Thus the Christian reader has the
   flower of their labours communicated to him very briefly, yet clearly
   and powerfully. And the manner of conveyance, being by way of amicable
   conference, is not only fitted to afford delight to the judicious
   reader, but lays him also at the advantage of trying, through grace,
   his own heart the more exactly, according to what echo it gives, or how
   it relishes, or is displeased with the several speeches of the
   communers. Here we have the greatest depths, and most painted delusions
   of hell, in opposition to the only way of salvation, discovered with
   marvellous brevity and evidence, and that by the concurring suffrages
   of burning and shining lights, men of the clearest experience, and
   honoured of God to do eminent service in their day, for advancing the
   interests of our Lord's kingdom and gospel.

   The reluctance of gospel light has been the choice mean blessed by the
   Lord, for the effecting of great things, in the several periods of the
   Church, since that light brake up in paradise, after our first sin and
   fall; and ever since, the balance has swayed, and will sway, according
   to the better or worse state of matters in that important regard. When
   gospel light is clear, and attended with power, Satan's kingdom cannot
   stand before it; the prince and powers of darkness must fall as
   lightning from heaven. And upon the contrary, according to the
   recessions from thence, Christian churches went off, by degrees, from
   the only foundation, even from the rock Christ, until the man of sin,
   the great antichrist, did mount the throne. Nevertheless, while the
   world is wandering after the beast, behold! evangelical light breaks
   forth in papal darkness, and hereupon antichrist's throne shakes, and
   is at the point of falling; yet his wounds are cured, and he recovers
   new strength and spirits, through a darkening of the glorious gospel,
   and perversion thereof, by anti-evangelical errors and heresies.

   That the tares of such errors are sown in the reformed churches, and by
   men who profess reformed faith, is beyond debate; and these, who lay to
   heart the purity of gospel doctrine. Such dregs of antichristianism do
   yet remain, or are brought in amongst us. Herein the words of the
   apostle are verified, viz: "Of your own selves shall men arise,
   speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them": and as
   this renders the essays for a further diffusion of evangelical light
   the more necessary and seasonable, so there is ground to hope, that in
   these ways the churches of Christ will gradually get the ascendant over
   their enemies, until the great antichrist shall fall, as a trophy
   before a gospel dispensation. For the Lord will "destroy him by the
   breath of his mouth, and with the brightness of his coming." That this
   excellent and spiritual piece may be blessed to the reader, is the
   prayer of their sincere well-wisher and servant in the work of the
   gospel. Carnock, December 4, 1717. JAMES HOG.

   The Act about the "Marrow" occasioned great thoughts of heart among us.
   I have been acquainted with that book about 18 or 19 years, and many
   times have admired the gracious conduct of holy Providence which
   brought it to my hand, having occasionally lighted upon it in a house
   of the parish where I was first settled. As to any distinct uptakings
   of the doctrine of the gospel I have, such as they are, I owe them to
   that book.--Extract of a Letter from Mr. Boston to Mr. Hog.

   I never read the "Marrow" with Mr. Boston's Notes, till this present
   time, 1755; and I find, by not having read it, I have sustained a
   considerable loss. It is a most valuable book; the doctrines it
   contains are the life of my soul, and the joy of my heart. Might my
   tongue or pen be made instrumental to recommend and illustrate, to
   support and propagate such precious truths, I should bless the day
   wherein I was born. Mr. Boston's Notes on the "Marrow" are, in my
   opinion, some of the most judicious and valuable that ever were
   penned.--Extract of a Letter from Mr. Hervey to Mr. William Hog.

   I have frequently perused, with great satisfaction, the "Marrow of
   Modern Divinity," first and second parts; and, as far as I can judge,
   it will be found, by those that read it, very useful for illustrating
   the difference between the law and the gospel, and preventing them from
   splitting, either on the rock of legality on the one hand, or that of
   Antinomianism on the other; and, accordingly, recommend it [by desire]
   as a book filled with precious, seasonable, and necessary truth,
   clearly founded upon the sacred oracles. Falkirk, December 9, 1788.
   JOHN BELFRAGE.

   It is considered necessary to add the following account of the author
   of "The Marrow of Modern Divinity" from Wood's Athena Oxonienses, vol.
   2, p 198:--"THOMAS BOSTON, the eldest son of a knight, became a
   gentleman-commoner of Brasen-nose College, August 25, 1627, took on his
   degree in arts, and soon after left that house. Afterwards, being
   called home by his relations, who were then, as I have been informed,
   much in debt, he improved that learning which he had obtained in the
   university so much, that he became a noted person among the learned,
   for his great reading in ecclesiastical history, and in the fathers,
   and for his admirable skill in the Greek and Hebrew languages. His
   works are,--1. 'An Appeal to the Conscience, as thou wilt answer it at
   the great and dreadful day of Jesus Christ.' Oxford, 1644. Quarto.--2.
   'The Marrow of Modern Divinity.' 1646, Octavo.--3. 'A Christian Caveat
   to Old and New Sabbatarians,' 1650.--4. 'An Answer to Sixteen Queries,
   touching the Rise and Observation of Christmas.'" The Marrow of Modern
   Divinity by THOMAS BOSTON

PREFACE.

   Whosoever thou art into whose hands this book shall come, I presume to
   put thee in mind of the divine command, binding on thy conscience,
   Deuteronomy 1:17 - "Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye
   shall hear the small as well as the great." Reject not the book with
   contempt, nor with indignation neither, when thou findest it entitled
   The Marrow of Modern Divinity, lest thou do it to thine own hurt.
   Remember, that our blessed Lord himself was "accounted a friend of
   publicans and sinners,' (Matt 11:19).--"Many said of him, He hath a
   devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?" (John 10:20). The apostle Paul was
   slanderously reported to be an Antinomian; one who, by his doctrine,
   encouraged men to do evil, and "make void the law," (Rom 3:8,31). And
   the first martyr, in the days of the gospel, was stoned for pretended
   "blasphemous words against Moses and against the law," (Acts 6:11,13).

   The gospel method of sanctification, as well as of justification, lies
   so far out of the ken of natural reason, that if all the rationalists
   in the world, philosophers and divines, had consulted together to lay
   down a plan for repairing the lost image of God in man, they had never
   hit upon that which the divine wisdom has pitched upon, viz: that
   sinners should be sanctified in Christ Jesus, (1 Cor 1:2), by faith in
   him, (Acts 26:18); nay, being laid before them, they would have
   rejected it with disdain, as foolishness, (1 Cor 1:23).

   In all views which fallen man has towards the means of his own
   recovery, the natural bent is to the way of the covenant of works. This
   is evident in the case of the vast multitudes throughout the world,
   embracing Judaism, Paganism, Mahometanism, and Popery. All these agree
   in this one principle, that it is by doing men must live, though they
   hugely differ as to the things to be done for life.

   The Jews, in the time of Julian the Apostate, attempted to rebuild
   their temple, after it had lain many years in ruins, by the decree of
   heaven never to be built again; and ceased not, till by an earthquake,
   which shook the old foundation and turned all down to the ground, they
   were forced to forbear, as Socrates the historian tells us. But the
   Jews were never more addicted to that temple, than mankind naturally is
   to the building on the first covenant: and Adam's children will by no
   means quit it, until Mount Sinai, where they desire to work what they
   do work, be all on a fire about them. Oh, that those who have been
   frightened from it were not so ready to go back towards it!

   Howbeit, that can never be the channel of sanctification, whatsoever
   way men prepare it and fit it out for that purpose, because it is not,
   by divine appointment, the "ministration of righteousness and life," (2
   Cor 3).

   And hence it is always to be observed, that as the doctrine of the
   gospel is corrupted, to introduce a more rational sort of religion, the
   flood of looseness and licentiousness swells proportionably; insomuch
   that morality, brought in for doctrine, in room and stead of the gospel
   of the grace of God, never fails to be, in effect, a signal for an
   inundation of immorality in practice. A plain instance hereof is to be
   seen in the grand apostasy from the truth and holiness of the gospel,
   as exemplified in Popery. And on the other hand, real and thorough
   reformation in churches is always the effect of gospel light, breaking
   forth again, from under the cloud which had gone over it; and hereof
   the Church of Scotland, among others, has, oftener than once, had
   comfortable experience.

   The real friends of true holiness, then, do exceedingly mistake their
   measures, in affording a handle, on any occasion whatsoever, for
   advancing the principles of legalism, for bringing under contempt the
   good old way in which our fathers found rest to their souls, and for
   removing the ancient landmarks which they set.

   It is now above fourscore years since this book made its first entrance
   into the world, under the title of The Marrow of Modern Divinity, at
   that time not unfitly prefixed to it; but it is too evident it has
   outlived the fitness of that title. The truth is, the divinity therein
   taught is now no longer the modern, but the ancient divinity, as it was
   recovered from underneath the Antichristian darkness; and as it stood
   before the tools of the late refiners on the Protestant doctrine were
   lifted up upon it--a doctrine which, being from God, must needs be
   according to godliness.

   It was to contribute towards the preserving of this doctrine, and the
   withstanding of its being run down, under the odious name of
   Antinomianism, in the disadvantageous situation it has in this book,
   whose undeserved lot it is to be everywhere spoken against, that the
   following notes were written.

   And herein two things chiefly have had weight: one is, lest that
   doctrine, being put into such an ill name, should become the object of
   the settled aversion of sober persons, and they be thereby betrayed
   into legalism. The other is, lest in these days of God's indignation so
   much appearing in spiritual judgments, some taking up the principles of
   it, from the hand of this author and ancient divines, for truths,
   should take the sense, scope, and design of them, from (now) common
   fame; and so be betrayed unto real Antinomianism.

   Reader, lay aside prejudices,--look and see with thine own eyes,--call
   things by their own names, and do not reckon Anti-Baxterianism or
   Anti-Neonomianism to be Antinomianism, and thou shalt find no
   Antinomianism taught here; but thou wilt be perhaps surprised to find,
   that the tale is told of Luther and other famous Protestant divines,
   under the borrowed name of the despised Mr. Fisher, author of The
   Marrow of Modern Divinity.

   In the Notes, obsolete or ambiguous words, phrases, and things are
   explained; truth cleared, confirmed, and vindicated; the annotator
   making no scruple of declaring his dissent from the author, where he
   saw just ground for it.

   I make no question but he will be thought by some to have constructed
   too favourably of several passages; but, as it is nothing strange that
   he inclines to the charitable side, the book having been many years ago
   blessed of God to his own soul; so, if he has erred on that side, it is
   the safest of the two for thee and me, judging of the words of another
   man, whose intention, I believe, with Mr. Burroughs, to have been very
   sincere for God and the reader's good. However, I am satisfied he has
   dealt candidly in that matter, according to his light.

   Be advised always to read over a lesser section of the book, before
   reading any of the notes thereupon, that you may have the more clear
   understanding of the whole.

   I conclude this preface, in the words of two eminent professors of
   theology, deserving our serious regard:--

   "I dread mightily that a rational sort of religion is coming in among
   us: I mean by it, a religion that consists in a bare attendance on
   outward duties and ordinances, without the power of godliness: and
   thence people shall fall into a way of serving God, which is a mere
   deism, having no relation to Jesus Christ and the Spirit of God." [1]

   "I warn each one of you, and especially such as are to be directors of
   the conscience, that you exercise yourselves in study, reading,
   meditation, and prayer, so as you may be able to instruct and comfort
   both your own and other's consciences in the time of temptation, and to
   bring them back from the law to grace, from the active (or working)
   righteousness, to the passive (or received) righteousness; in a word,
   from Moses to Christ." [2]

   TO THE HON. COLONEL JOHN DOWNES, One of

   the Members of the Honourable House of Commons, &c., E. F. wishes the
   true knowledge of God in Jesus Christ.

   MOST HONOURED SIR,

   Although I do observe that new editions, accompanied with new
   additions, are sometimes published with new dedications; yet so long as
   he who formerly owned the subject does yet live, and has the same
   affections towards it, I conceive there is no need of a new patron, but
   of a new epistle.

   Be pleased then, most honoured sir, to give me leave to tell you, that
   your eminency of place did somewhat induce me, both now and before, to
   make choice of you for its patron; but your endowments with grace did
   invite me to it, God having bestowed upon you special spiritual
   blessings in heavenly things in Christ: for it has been declared unto
   me, by them that knew you when you were but a youth, how Christ met
   with you then, and by sending his Spirit into your heart, first
   convinced you of sin, as was manifest by those conflicts which your
   soul then had both with Satan and itself, whilst you did not believe in
   Christ; secondly, of righteousness, as was manifest by the peace and
   comfort which you afterwards had, by believing that Christ was gone to
   the Father, and appeared in his presence as your advocate and surety
   that had undertaken for you; thirdly, of judgment, as has been manifest
   ever since, in that you have been careful with the true godly man,
   Psalm 112:5, to "guide your affairs with judgment," in walking
   according to the mind of Christ.

   I have not forgotten what desires you have expressed to know the true
   difference between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace; and
   experimentally to be acquainted with the doctrine of free grace, the
   mysteries of Christ, and the life of faith. Witness not only your high
   approving of some heads of a sermon, which I once heard a godly
   minister preach, and repeated in your hearing, of the life of faith;
   but also your earnest request to me to write them out fair, and send
   them to you into the country; yea, witness your highly approving of
   this dialogue, when I first acquainted you with the contents thereof,
   encouraging me to expedite it to the press, and your kind acceptance,
   together with your cordial thanks for my love manifested in dedicating
   it to your honourable name.

   Since then, worthy sire, it has pleased the Lord to enable me both to
   amend and enlarge it, I hope your affection will also be enlarged
   towards the matter therein contained, considering that it tends to the
   clearing of those forenamed truths, and, through the blessing of God,
   may be a means to root them more deeply in your heart. And truly, sir,
   I am confident the more they grown and flourish in any man's heart, the
   more will all heart-corruptions wither and decay. O sir, if the truths
   contained in this dialogue were but as much in my heart, as they are in
   my head, I were a happy man; for then should I be more free from pride,
   vain glory, wrath, anger, self-love, and love of the world, than I am;
   and then should I have more humility, meekness, and love, both to God
   and man, than I have. Oh! then should I be content with Christ alone,
   and live above all things in the world;--then should I experimentally
   know both how to abound and how to want;--and then should I be fit for
   any condition: nothing could come amiss to me. Oh, that the Lord would
   be pleased to write them in our hearts by his blessed Spirit!

   Most humbly beseeching you still to pardon my boldness, and vouchsafe
   to take it into your patronage and protection, I humbly take my leave
   of you, and remain, your obliged servant to be commanded,

   THOMAS BOSTON.

To All Such Humble-Hearted Readers,

   As See Any Need To Learn Either To Know Themselves, Or

   God In Christ.

   LOVING CHRISTIANS,

   Consider, I pray you, that as the first Adam did, as a common person,
   enter into covenant with God for all mankind, and brake it, whereby
   they became sinful and guilty of everlasting death and damnation; even
   so Jesus Christ, the second Adam, did, as a common person, enter into
   covenant with God his Father, for all the elect [3] , that is to say,
   all those that have, or shall believe on his name [4] , and for them
   kept it [5] ; whereby they become righteous, and heirs of everlasting
   life and salvation [6] ; and therefore it is our greatest wisdom, and
   ought to be our greatest care and endeavour, to come out [7] and from
   the first Adam, unto and into the second Adam; [8] that so we "may have
   life through his name," (John 20:31).

   And yet, alas! there is no point in all practical divinity that we are
   naturally so much averse and backward to as unto this; neither does
   Satan strive to hinder us so much from doing anything else as this; and
   hence it is, that we are all of us naturally apt to abide and continue
   in that sinful and miserable state that the first Adam plunged us into,
   without either taking any notice of it, or being at all affected with
   it, so far are we from coming out of it. And if the Lord be pleased by
   any means to open our eyes to see our misery, and we do thereupon begin
   to step out of it, yet, alas! we are prone rather to go backwards
   towards the first Adam's pure state [9] , in striving and struggling to
   leave sin, and perform duties, and do good works; hoping thereby to
   make ourselves so righteous and holy, that God will let us into
   paradise again, to eat of the tree of life, and live for ever: and this
   we do, until we see the "flaming sword at Eden's gate turning every way
   to keep the way of the tree of life," [10] (Gen 3:24). Is it not
   ordinary, when the Lord convinceth a man of his sin (either by means of
   his word or his rod) to cry after this manner: Oh! I am a sinful man!
   for I have lived a very wicked life, and therefore surely the Lord is
   angry with me, and will damn me in hell! Oh! what shall I do to save my
   soul? And is there not at hand some ignorant, miserable comforter,
   ready to say, Yet do not despair, man, but repent of thy sins, and ask
   God forgiveness, and reform your life, and doubt not but he will be
   merciful unto you [11] ; for he has promised, you know, "that at what
   time soever a sinner repenteth him of his sins, he will forgive him."
   [12]

   And does he not hereupon comfort himself, and say in his heart at
   least, Oh! if the Lord will but spare my life, and lengthen out my
   days, I will become a new man! I am very sorry that I have lived such a
   sinful life; but I will never do as I have done for all the world! Oh!
   you shall see a great change in me! believe it?

   And hereupon he betakes himself to a new course of life; and, it may
   be, becomes a zealous professor of religion, performing all Christian
   exercises, both public and private, and leaves off his old companions,
   and keeps company with religious men; and so, it may be, goes on till
   his dying day, and thinks himself sure of heaven and eternal happiness;
   and yet, it may be, all this while is ignorant of Christ and his
   righteousness, and therefore establisheth his own.

   Where is the man, or where is the woman that is truly come to Christ,
   that has not had some experience in themselves of such a disposition as
   this? If there be any that have reformed their lives, and are become
   professors of religion, and have not taken notice of this in themselves
   more, or less, I wish they may have gone beyond a legal professor, or
   one still under the covenant of works.

   Nay, where is the man or woman, that is truly in Christ, that findeth
   not in themselves an aptness to withdraw their hearts from Christ, and
   to put some confidence in their own works and doings? If there be any
   that do not find it, I wish their hearts may not deceive them.

   Let me confess ingenuously, I was a professor of religion at least a
   dozen of years before I knew any other way to eternal life, than to be
   sorry for my sins, and ask forgiveness, and strive and endeavour to
   fulfil the law, and keep the commandments, according as Mr. Dod and
   other godly men had expounded them; and truly, I remember I was in hope
   I should at last attain to the perfect fulfilling of them; and, in the
   mean time, I conceived that God would accept the will for the deed; or
   what I could not do, Christ had done for me.

   And though at last, by means of conferring with Mr. Thomas Hooker in
   private, the Lord was pleased to convince me that I was yet but a proud
   Pharisee, and to show me the way of faith and salvation by Christ
   alone, and to give me, I hope, a heart in some measure to embrace it;
   yet, alas! through the weakness of my faith, I have been, and am still
   apt to turn aside to the covenant of works; and therefore have not
   attained to that joy and peace in believing, nor that measure of love
   to Christ, and man for Christ's sake, as I am confident many of God's
   saints do attain unto in the time of this life. The Lord be merciful
   unto me, and increase my faith!

   And are there not others, though I hope but few, who being enlightened
   to see their misery, by reason of the guilt of sin, though not by
   reason of the filth of sin, and hearing of justification freely by
   grace, through the redemption which is in Jesus Christ, do applaud and
   magnify that doctrine, following them that do most preach and press the
   same, seeming to be, as it were, ravished with the hearing thereof, out
   of a conceit that they are by Christ freely justified from the guilt of
   sin, though still they retain the filth of sin? [13] These are they
   that content themselves with a gospel knowledge, with mere notions in
   the head, but not in the heart; glorying and rejoicing in free grace
   and justification by faith alone; professing faith in Christ, and yet
   are not possessed of Christ;--these are they that can talk like
   believers, and yet do not walk like believers,; these are they that
   have language like saints, and yet have conversation like
   devils;--these are they that are not obedient to the law of Christ, and
   therefore are justly called Antinomians.

   Now, both these paths [14] leading from Christ, have been justly judged
   as erroneous; and to my knowledge, not only a matter of eighteen or
   twenty years ago, but also within these three or four years, there has
   been much ado, both by preaching, writing, and disputing, both to
   reduce men out of them, and to keep them from them; and hot contentions
   have been on both sides, and all, I fear, to little purpose: for has
   not the strict professor according to the law, whilst he has striven to
   reduce the loose professor according to the gospel out of the
   Antinomian path, entangled both himself and others the faster in the
   yoke of bondage? (Gal 5:1). And has not the loose professor according
   to the gospel, whilst he has striven to reduce the strict professor
   according to the law out of the legal path, "by promising liberty from
   the law, taught others, and been himself the servant of corruption?" (2
   Peter 2:19).

   For this cause I, though I be nothing, have by the grace of God
   endeavoured, in this Dialogue, to walk as a middle man betwixt them
   both, in showing to each of them his erroneous path, with the middle
   path, (which is Jesus Christ received truly, and walked in answerably,)
   [15] as a means to bring them both unto him, and make them both one in
   him; and Oh! that the Lord would be pleased so to bless it to them,
   that it might be a means to produce that effect!

   I have, as you may see, gathered much of it out of known and approved
   authors; and yet have therein wronged no man, for I have restored it to
   the right owner again. Some part of it my manuscripts have afforded me;
   and of the rest I hope I may say, as Jacob did of his venison, (Gen
   27:20), "the Lord hath brought it unto me." Let me speak it without
   vain glory, I have endeavoured herein to imitate the laborious bee, who
   out of divers flowers gathers honey and wax, and thereof makes one
   comb: if any souls feel any sweetness in it, let them praise God, and
   pray for me, who am weak in faith, and cold in love.

   [5] Namely, by doing and dying for them, viz: the elect.

   [6] Thus the impetration or purchase of redemption, and the application

   [9] That is, to the way of the covenant of works, which innocent Adam
   was set upon.

   [10] That is, till we be brought to despair of obtaining salvation in
   the way of the covenant of works. Mark here the spring of legalism,
   namely, the natural bias of man's heart towards the way of the law, as
   a covenant of works, and ignorance of the law, in its spirituality and
   vast extent, (Rom 7:9, 10:2,3).

   [11] There is not one word of Jesus Christ the glorious Mediator, nor
   of faith in his blood, in all the advice given by this casuist to the
   afflicted; and agreeable thereto is the effect it has upon the
   afflicted, who takes comfort to himself, without looking unto the Lord
   Jesus Christ at all, as appears from the next paragraph.
   Behold the Scripture pattern in such a case: Acts 2:37,38, "Men and
   brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent and be
   baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the
   remission of sins." Chapter 16:30,31, "Sirs, what must I do to be
   saved? and they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
   be saved." And thus the Directory, title "Concerning Visitation of the
   Sick." "If it appear that he hath not a due sense of his sins,
   endeavours ought to be used to convince him of his sins--to make known
   the danger of deferring repentance, and of salvation at any time
   offered, to awaken the conscience, and to rouse him out of a stupid and
   secure condition, to apprehend the justice and wrath of God";--here
   this miserable comforter finds the afflicted, and should have taught
   him concerning an offended God, as there immediately follows--"before
   whom none can stand but he that, being lost in himself, layeth hold
   upon Christ by faith."

   [12] This sentence, taken from the English service-book, is in the
   "Practice of Piety," p. 122, cited from Ezekiel 33:14,16, and is
   reckoned amongst these Scriptures, an ignorant mistake of which keeps
   back a sinner from the practice of piety. But the truth is, it is not
   to be found in the Old or New Testament; and therefore it was objected
   against, as standing in the service-book under the name of a "Sentence
   of Scripture," pretended to be cited from Ezekiel 18:21,22.--Reasons
   Showing the Necessity of Reformation, &c. p. 26.

   [13] Mark here the spring of Antinomianism; namely, the want of a sound
   conviction of the odiousness and filthiness of sin, rendering the soul
   loathsome and abominable in the sight of a holy God. Hence, as the
   sinner sees not his need of, so neither will he receive and rest on
   Christ for all his salvation, but will go about to halve it, grasping
   at his justifying blood, neglecting his sanctifying Spirit, and so
   falls short of all part or lot in that matter.

   [14] Namely, legalism and Antinomianism.

   [15] A short and pithy description of the middle path, the only pathway
   to heaven--"Jesus Christ [the way, (John 14:6)] received truly [by
   faith, (John 1:12); this is overlooked by the legalist] and walked in
   answerably," by holiness of heart and life, (Col 2:6); this is
   neglected by the Antinomian. The Antinomian's faith is but pretended,
   and not true faith, since he walks not in Christ answerably. The
   legalist's holiness is but pretended, and not tt true holiness, since
   he hath not "received Christ" truly, and therefore is incapable of
   walking in Christ, which is the only true holiness competent to fallen
   mankind. Thus, both the legalist and Antinomian are each of them
   destitute of true faith and true holiness; forasmuch as there can be no
   walking in Christ, without a true receiving of him; and there cannot be
   a true receiving of him without walking in him: so both of them are off
   the only way of salvation, and, continuing so, must needs perish.
   Wherefore it concerns every one who has a value for his own soul, to
   take heed that he be found in the middle path.

   INTRODUCTION

   EVANGELISTA, a Minister of the Gospel.

   NOMIST, a Legalist.

   ANTINOMISTA, an Antinomian.

   NEOPHYTUS, a Young Christian.

   Sect. 1. Differences about the Law.--2. A threefold Law.

   Nomista. Sir, my neighbour, Neophytus and I having lately had some
   conference with this our friend and acquaintance, Antinomista, about
   some points of religion, wherein he, differing from us both, at last
   said he would be contented to be judged by our minister: therefore,
   have we made bold to come unto you, all three of us, to pray you to
   hear us, and judge of our differences.

   Evan. You are all of you very welcome to me; and if you please to let
   me hear what your differences are, I will tell you what I think.

   SECT. 1.--Nom. The truth is, sir, he and I differ in very many things;
   but more especially about the law: for I say, the law ought to be a
   rule of life to a believer; and he says, it ought not.

   Neo. And surely, sir, the greatest difference betwixt him and me, is
   this;--he would persuade me to believe in Christ; and bids me rejoice
   in the Lord, and live merrily, though I feel never so many corruptions
   in my heart, yea, though I be never so sinful in my life; the which I
   cannot do, nor, I think, ought to do; but rather to fear, and sorrow,
   and lament for my sins.

   Ant. The truth is, sir, the greatest difference betwixt my friend
   Nomista and me, is about the law; and therefore that is the greatest
   matter we come to you about.

   Evan. I remember the Apostle Paul willeth Titus to "avoid contentions
   and strivings about the law, because they are unprofitable and vain,"
   (Titus 3:9); and so I fear yours have been.

   Nom. Sir, for my own part, I hold it very meet, that every true
   Christian should be very zealous for the holy law of God; especially
   now, when a company of these Antinomians do set themselves against it,
   and do what they can quite to abolish it, and utterly to root it out of
   the church: surely, sir, I think it not meet they should live in a
   Christian commonwealth.

   Evan. I pray you, neighbour Nomista, be not so hot, neither let us have
   such unchristian-like expressions amongst us; but let us reason
   together in love, and with the spirit of meekness, (1 Cor 4:21), as
   Christians ought to do. I confess with the apostle, "It is good to be
   zealously affected always in a good thing," (Gal 4:18). But yet, as the
   same apostle said of the Jews, so I fear I may say of some Christians,
   that "they are zealous of the law," (Acts 21:20); yea, some would be
   doctors of the law, and yet neither understand "what they say, nor
   whereof they affirm," (1 Tim 1:7).

   Nom. Sir, I make no doubt but that I both know what I say, and whereof
   I affirm, when I say and affirm that the holy law of God ought to be a
   rule of life to a believer; for I dare pawn my soul on the truth of it.

   Evan. But what law do you mean?

   Nom. Why, sir, what law do you think I mean? Are there any more laws
   than one?

   SECT. 2.--Evan. Yea, in the Scriptures there is mention made of divers
   laws, but they may all be comprised under these three, viz.--the law of
   works, the law of faith, and the law of Christ; [16] (Rom 3:27, Gal
   6:2); and, therefore, I pray you, tell me, when you say the law ought
   to be a rule of life to a believer, which of these three laws you mean.

   Nom. Sir, I know not the difference betwixt them; but this I know, that
   the law of the ten commandments, commonly called the moral law, ought
   to be a rule of life to a believer.

   Evan. But the law of the ten commandments, or moral law may be either
   said to be the matter of the law of works, or the matter of the law of
   Christ: and therefore I pray you to tell me, in whether of these senses
   you conceive it ought to be a rule of life to a believer?

   Nom. Sir, I must confess, I do not know what you mean by this
   distinction; but this I know, that God requires that every Christian
   should frame and lead his life according to the ten commandments; the
   which if he do, then may he expect the blessing of God both upon his
   own soul and body; and if he do not, then can he expect nothing else
   but his wrath and curse upon them both.

   Evan. The truth is, Nomista, the law of the ten commandments, as it is
   the matter of the law of works, ought not to be a rule of life to a
   believer. But in thus saying, you have affirmed that it ought; and
   therefore therein you have erred from the truth. And now, Antinomista,
   that I may also know your judgment, when you say the law ought not to
   be a rule of life to a believer, pray tell me what law do you mean?

   Ant. Why, I mean the law of the ten commandments.

   Evan. But whether do you mean that law, as it is the matter of the law
   of works, or as it is the matter of the law of Christ?

   Ant. Surely, sir, I do conceive, that the ten commandments are no way
   to be a rule of life to a believer; for Christ hath delivered him from
   them.

   Evan. But the truth is, the law of the ten commandments, as it is the
   matter of the law of Christ, ought to be a rule of life to a believer;
   [17] and therefore you having affirmed the contrary, have therein also
   erred from the truth.

   Nom. The truth is, sir, I must confess I never took any notice of this
   threefold law, which, it seems, is mentioned in the New Testament.

   Ant. And I must confess, if I took any notice of them, I never
   understood them.

   Evan. Well, give me leave to tell you, that so far as any man comes
   short of the true knowledge of this threefold law, [18] so far he comes
   short both of the true knowledge of God and of himself; and therefore I
   wish you both to consider of it.

   Nom. Sir, if it be so, you may do well to be a means to inform us, and
   help us to the true knowledge of this threefold law; and therefore, I
   pray you, first tell us what is meant by the law of works.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] These terms are scriptural, as appears from the whole texts quoted
   by our author, namely, (Rom 3:27), "Where is boasting then? it is
   excluded. By what law? of works? nay: but by the law of faith."--(Gal
   6:2), "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
   By the law of works is meant the law of the ten commandments, as the
   covenant of works. By the law of faith, the gospel, or covenant of
   grace; for justification being the point upon which the apostle there
   states the opposition betwixt these two laws, it is evident that the
   former only is the law that doth not exclude boasting; and that the
   latter only is it, by which a sinner is justified in a way that doth
   exclude boasting. By the law of Christ, is meant the same law of the
   ten commandments, as a rule of life, in the hand of a Mediator, to
   believers already justified, and not any one command of the law only;
   for "bearing one another's burdens" is a "fulfilling of the law of
   Christ," as it is a loving one another: but, according to the
   Scripture, that love is not a fulfilling of one command only, but of
   the whole law of the ten commands, (Rom 13:8-10).--"He that loveth
   another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit
   adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not
   bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other
   commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou
   shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; therefore love is the fulfilling
   of the law." It is a fulfilling of the second table directly, and of
   the first table indirectly and consequentially: therefore, by the law
   of Christ is meant, not one command only, but the whole law.
   The law of works is the law to be done, that one may be saved; the law
   of faith is the law to be believed, that one may be saved; the law of
   Christ is the law of the Saviour, binding his saved people to all the
   duties of obedience, (Gal 3:12, Acts 16:31).
   The term law is not here used univocally; for the law of faith is
   neither in the Scripture sense, nor in the sense of our author, a law,
   properly so called. The apostle uses that phrase only in imitation of
   the Jews' manner of speaking, who had the law continually in their
   mouths. But since the promise of the gospel proposed to faith, is
   called in Scripture "the law of faith," our author was sufficiently
   warranted to call it so too. So the law of faith is not a proper
   preceptive law.
   The law of works, and the law of Christ, are in substance but one law,
   even the law of the ten commandments--the moral law--that law which was
   from the beginning, continuing still the same in its own nature, but
   vested with different forms. And since that law is perfect, and sin is
   any want of conformity unto, or transgression of it, whatever form it
   be vested with, whether as the law of works or as the law of Christ,
   all commands of God unto men must needs be comprehended under it, and
   particularly the command to repent, common to all mankind, pagans not
   excepted, who doubtless are obliged, as well as others, to turn from
   sin unto God; as also the command to believe in Christ, binding all to
   whom the gospel revelation comes, though, in the meantime, this law
   stands under different forms to those who are in a state of union with
   Christ by faith, and to those who are not so. The law of Christ is not
   a new, proper, preceptive law, but the old, proper, preceptive law,
   which was from the beginning, under a new accidental form.
   The distinction between the law of works and the law of faith cannot be
   controverted, since the apostle doth so clearly distinguish them, (Rom
   3:27).
   The distinction between the law of works and the law of Christ, as
   above explained according to the Scriptures, and the mind of our
   author, is the same in effect with that of the law, as a covenant of
   works, and as a rule of life to believers, and ought to be admitted,
   (Westm. Confess. chap. 19, art. 6). For, (1.) Believers are not under,
   but dead to the law of works, (Rom 6:14), "For ye are not under the
   law, but under grace."--(7:4), "Wherefore my brethren, ye also are
   become dead to the law, that ye should be married to another, even to
   him who is raised from the dead."--(1 Cor 9:21), "Being not without law
   to God, but under the law of Christ." Some copies read here "of God,"
   and "of Christ"; which I mention, not out of any regard to that
   different reading, but that upon the occasion thereof the sense is
   owned by the learned to be the same either way. To be under the law to
   God is, without question, to be under the law of God; whatever it may
   be judged to import more, it can import no less; therefore to be under
   the law to Christ, is to be under the law of Christ. This text gives a
   plain and decisive answer to the question, "How is the believer under
   the law of God?" namely, as he is under the law to Christ. (2.) The law
   of Christ is an "easy yoke," and a "light burden," (Matt 11:30); but
   the law of works, to a sinner, is an insupportable burden, requiring
   works as the condition of justification and acceptance with God, as is
   clear from the whole of the apostle's reasoning, (Rom 3). [and
   therefore it is called the law of works, for otherwise the law of
   Christ requires works too,] and cursing "every one that continues not
   in all things written in it to do them," (Gal 3:10). The apostle
   assures us, that "what things soever the law saith, it saith to them
   who are under the law," (Rom 3:19). The duties of the law of works, as
   such, are, as I conceive, called by our Lord himself, "heavy burdens,
   and grievous to be borne," (Matt 23:4).--"For they," viz: the Scribes
   and Pharisees, "bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay
   them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with
   one of their fingers." These heavy burdens were not human traditions,
   and rites devised by men; for Christ would not have commanded the
   observing and doing of these, as in this case he did, (verse 3),
   "Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do"; neither were
   they the Mosaic rites and ceremonies, which were not then abrogated,
   for the Scribes and Pharisees were so far from not moving these burdens
   with one of their own fingers, that the whole of their religion was
   confined to them, namely to the rites and ceremonies of Moses' law, and
   those of their own devising. But the duties of the moral law they laid
   on others, binding them on with the tie of the law of works, yet made
   no conscience of them in their own practice: the which duties,
   nevertheless, our Lord Jesus commanded to be observed and done.
   "He who hath believed on Jesus Christ, [though he be freed from the
   curse of the law,] is not freed from the command and obedience of the
   law, but tied thereunto by a new obligation, and a new command from
   Christ. Which new command from Christ importeth help to obey the
   command."--Practical Use of Saving Knowledge, title, The Third Warrant
   to Believe, fig. 5.
   What this distinction amounts to is, that thereby a difference is
   constituted betwixt the ten commandments as coming from an absolute God
   out of Christ unto sinners, and the same ten commandments as coming
   from God in Christ unto them; a difference which the children of God,
   assisting their consciences before him to "receive the law at his
   mouth," will value as their life, however they disagree about it in
   words and manner of expression. But that the original indispensable
   obligation of the law of the ten commandments is in any measure
   weakened by the believer's taking it as the law of Christ, and not as
   the law of works; or that the sovereign authority of God the Creator,
   which is inseparable from it for the ages of eternity, in what channel
   soever it be conveyed unto men, is thereby laid aside,--will appear
   utterly groundless, upon an impartial consideration of the matter. For
   is not our Lord Jesus Christ, equally with the Father and the Holy
   Spirit, JEHOVAH, the Sovereign, Supreme, Most High God, Creator of the
   world? (Isa 47:4, Jer 23:6, with Psa 83:18, John 1:3, Rev 3:14). Is not
   the same [or sovereign authority] of God in Christ? (Exo 23:21). Is not
   he in the Father, and the Father in him? (John 14:11). Nay, doth not
   all the fullness of the Godhead dwell in him? (Col 2:9). How, then, can
   the original obligation of the law of the ten commandments, arising
   from the authority of the Creator, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be
   weakened by its being issued unto the believer from and by that blessed
   channel, the Lord Jesus Christ?
   As for the distinction betwixt the law of faith and the law of Christ,
   the latter is subordinated unto the former. All men by nature are under
   the law of works; but taking the benefit of the law of faith, by
   believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, they are set free from the law of
   works, and brought under the law of Christ.--(Matt 11:28,29), "Come
   unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden--take my yoke upon
   you."

   [17] The law of the ten commandments, being the natural law, was
   written on Adam's heart on his creation; while as yet it was neither
   the law of works, nor the law of Christ, in the sense wherein these
   terms are used in Scripture, and by our author. But after man was
   created, and put into the garden, this natural law, having made man
   liable to fall away from God, a threatening of eternal death in case of
   disobedience, had also a promise of eternal life annexed to it in case
   of obedience; in virtue of while he, having done his work, might
   thereupon plead and demand the reward of eternal life. Thus it became
   the law of works, whereof the ten commandments were, and are still the
   matter. All mankind being ruined by the breach of this law, Jesus
   Christ obeys and dies in the room of the elect, that they might be
   saved; they being united to him by faith, are, through his obedience
   and satisfaction imputed to them, freed from eternal death, and become
   heirs of everlasting life; so that the law of works being fully
   satisfied, expires as to them, as it would have done of course in the
   case of Adam's having stood the time of his trial: howbeit it remains
   in full force as to unbelievers. But the natural law of the ten
   commandments [which can never expire or determine, but is obligatory in
   all possible states of the creature, in earth, heaven, or hell] is,
   from the moment the law of works expires as to believers, issued forth
   to them [still liable to infirmities, though not to falling away like
   Adam] in the channel of the covenant of grace, bearing a promise of
   help to obey, (Ezek 36:27), and, agreeable to their state before the
   Lord, having annexed to it a promise of the tokens of God's fatherly
   love, for the sake of Christ, in case of that obedience; and a
   threatening of God's fatherly displeasure in case of their
   disobedience. (John 14:21), "He that hath my commandments, and keepeth
   them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me, shall be loved of
   my Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him."--(Psa
   89:31-33), "If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
   then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity
   with stripes. Nevertheless, my loving kindness will I not utterly take
   from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail." Thus it becomes the law
   of Christ to them; of which law also the same ten commandments are
   likewise the matter. In the threatenings of this law there is no
   revenging wrath; and in the promises of it no proper conditionalty of
   works; but here is the order in the covenant of grace, to which the law
   of Christ belongs; a beautiful order of grace, obedience, particular
   favours, and chastisements for disobedience. Thus the ten commandments
   stand, both in the law of works and in the law of Christ at the same
   time, being the common matter of both; but as they are the matter of
   [i.e. stand in] the law of works, they are actually a part of the law
   of works; howbeit, as they are the matter of, or stand in, the law of
   Christ, they are actually a part, not of the law of works, but of the
   law of Christ. And as they stand in the law of Christ, our author
   expressly asserts, against the Antinomian, that they ought to be a rule
   of life to a believer; but that they ought to be a rule of life to a
   believer, as they stand in the law of works, he justly denies, against
   the legalist. Even as when one and the same crime stands forbidden in
   the laws of different independent kingdoms, it is manifest that the
   rule of life to the subjects in that particular is the prohibition, as
   it stands in the law of that kingdom whereof they are subjects
   respectively, and not as it stands in the law of that kingdom of which
   they are not subjects.

   [18] Not of the terms here used to express it by, but of the things
   thereby meant, viz: the covenant of works, the covenant of grace, and
   the law as a rule of life to believers, in whatever terms these things
   be expressed.

Chapter I, Section I

   The nature of the covenant of works.

   Evan. The law of works, opposed to the law of faith, (Rom 3:27), holds
   forth as much as the covenant of works; for it is manifest, says
   Musculus, that the word which signifies covenant, or bargain, is put
   for law: so that you see the law of works is as much as to say, the
   covenant of works; the which covenant the Lord made with all mankind in
   Adam before his fall; the sum whereof was, "Do this, and thou shalt
   live," (Lev 18:5); "and if thou do it not, thou shalt die the death,"
   (Gen 2:17). In which covenant there was contained first a precept, "Do
   this"; secondly a promise joined unto it, "If thou do it thou shalt
   live"; thirdly, a like threatening, "If thou do it not, thou shalt die
   the death." Imagine, says Musculus, that God had said to Adam, Lo, to
   the intent that thou mayest live, I have given thee liberty to eat, and
   have given thee abundantly to eat: let all the fruits of paradise be in
   thy power, one tree excepted, which see thou touch not, for that I keep
   to mine own authority: the same is "the tree of knowledge of good and
   evil"; if thou touch it, the meat thereof shall not be life, but death.
   Nom. But, sir, you said, that the law of the ten commandments, or moral
   law, may be said to be the matter of the law of works; and you have
   also said, that the law of works is as much as to say the covenant of
   works, whereby it seems to me, you hold that the law of the ten
   commandments was the matter of the covenant of works, which God made
   with all mankind in Adam before his fall.
   Evan. That is a truth agreed upon by all authors and interpreters that
   I know. And indeed the law of works [as a learned author says]
   signifies the moral law; and the moral law, strictly and properly
   taken, signifies the covenant of works. [19]
   Nom. But, sir, what is the reason you call it but the matter of the
   covenant of works?
   Evan. The reason why I rather choose to call the law of the ten
   commandments the matter of the covenant of works, than the covenant
   itself, is, because I conceive that the matter of it cannot properly be
   called the covenant of works, except the form be put upon it; that is
   to say, except the Lord require, and man undertake to yield perfect
   obedience thereunto, upon condition of eternal life and death.
   And therefore, till then, it was not a covenant of works betwixt God
   and all mankind in Adam; as, for example, you know, that although a
   servant [20] have an ability to do a master's work, and though a master
   have wages to bestow upon him for it; yet is there not a covenant
   betwixt them till they have thereupon agreed. Even so, though a man at
   the first had power to yield perfect and perpetual obedience to all the
   ten commandments, and God had an eternal life to bestow upon him; yet
   was there not a covenant betwixt them till they were thereupon agreed.
   Nom. But, sir, you know there is no mention made in the book of Genesis
   of this covenant of works, which, you say, was made with man at first.
   Evan. Though we read not the word "covenant" betwixt God and man, yet
   have we there recorded what may amount to as much; for God provided and
   promised to Adam eternal happiness, and called for perfect obedience,
   which appears from God's threatening, (Gen 2:17); for if man must die
   if he disobeyed, it implies strongly, that God's covenant was with him
   for life, if he obeyed.
   Nom. But, sir, you know the word "covenant" signifies a mutual promise,
   bargain, and obligation betwixt two parties. Now, though it is implied
   that God promised man to give him life if he obeyed, yet we read not,
   that man promised to be obedient.
   Evan. I pray take notice, that God does not always tie man to verbal
   expressions, but doth often contract the covenant in real impressions
   in the heart and frame of the creature, [21] and this was the manner of
   covenanting with man at the first; [22] for God had furnished his soul
   with an understanding mind, whereby he might discern good from evil,
   and right from wrong: and not only so, but also in his will was most
   great uprightness, (Eccl 7:29); and his instrumental parts [23] were
   orderly framed to obedience. The truth is, God did engrave in man's
   soul wisdom and knowledge of his will and works, and integrity in the
   whole soul, and such a fitness in all the powers thereof, that neither
   the mind did conceive, nor the heart desire, nor the body put in
   execution, anything but that which was acceptable to God; so that man,
   endued with these qualities, was able to serve God perfectly.
   Nom. But, sir, how could the law of the ten commandments be the matter
   of this covenant of works, when they were not written, as you know,
   till the time of Moses?
   Evan. Though they were not written in tables of stone until the time of
   Moses, yet were they written in the tables of man's heart in the time
   of Adam: for we read that man was created in the image or likeness of
   God, (Gen 1:27). And the ten commandments are a doctrine agreeing with
   the eternal wisdom and justice that is in God; wherein he hath so
   painted out his own nature, that it does in a manner express the very
   image of God, (Col 3:10). And does not the apostle say, (Eph 4:24),
   that the image of God consists in knowledge, righteousness, and true
   holiness? And is not knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness, the
   perfection of both the tables of the law? And indeed, says Mr. Rollock,
   it could not well stand with the justice of God, to make a covenant
   with man, under the condition of holy and good works, and perfect
   obedience to his law, except he had first created man holy and pure,
   and engraven his law in his heart, whence those good works should
   proceed.
   Nom. But yet I cannot but marvel that God, in making the covenant with
   man, did make mention of no other commandment than that of the
   forbidden fruit.
   Evan. Do not marvel at it: for by that one species of sin the whole
   genus or kind is shown; as the same law, being more clearly unfolded,
   doth express, (Deut 28:26, Gal 3:10). And, indeed, in that one
   commandment the whole worship of God did consist; as obedience, honour,
   love, confidence, and religious fear; together with the outward
   abstinence from sin, and reverend respect to the voice of God; yea,
   herein also consisted his love, and so his whole duty to his neighbour;
   [24] so that, as a learned writer says, Adam heard as much [of the law]
   in the garden, as Israel did at Sinai; but only in fewer words, and
   without thunder.
   Nom. But, sir, ought not man to have yielded perfect obedience to God,
   though this covenant had not been made betwixt them?
   Evan. Yea, indeed; perfect and perpetual obedience was due from man
   unto God, though God had made no promise to man; for when God created
   man at first, he put forth an excellency from himself into him; and
   therefore it was the bond and tie that lay upon man to return that gain
   unto God; [25] so that man being God's creature, by the law of creation
   he owed all obedience and subjection to God his Creator.
   Nom. Why, then, was it needful that the Lord should make a covenant
   with him, by promising him life, and threatening him with death?
   Evan. For answer hereunto, in the first place, I pray you understand,
   that man was a reasonable creature; and so, out of judgment,
   discretion, and election, able to make choice of his way, and therefore
   it was meet there should be such a covenant made with him, that he
   might, according to God's appointment, serve him after a reasonable
   manner. Secondly, It was meet there should be such a covenant made with
   him, to show that he was not such a prince on earth, but that he had a
   sovereign Lord: therefore, God set a punishment upon the breach of his
   commandment; [26] that man might know his inferiority, and that things
   betwixt him and God were not as betwixt equals. Thirdly, It was meet
   there should be such a covenant made with him, to show that he had
   nothing by personal, immediate, and underived right, but all by gift
   and gentleness: so that you see it was an equal covenant, [27] which
   God, out of his prerogative-royal, made with mankind in Adam before his
   fall.
   Nom. Well, sir, I do perceive that Adam and all mankind in him were
   created most holy.
   Evan. Yea, and most happy, too: for God placed him in paradise in the
   midst of all delightful pleasures and contents, wherein he did enjoy
   most near and sweet communion with his Creator, in whose presence is
   fullness of joy, and whose right hand are pleasures evermore, (Psa
   16:11). So that if Adam had received of the tree of life, by taking and
   eating it, while he stood in the state of innocency before his fall, he
   had certainly been established in a happy estate for ever, and could
   not have been seduced and supplanted by Satan, as some learned men, do
   think, and as God's own words seem to imply, (Gen 3:22). [28]

Chapter I, Section II

   Adam's fall.
   Nom. But it seemeth that Adam did not continue in that holy and happy
   estate.
   Evan. No, indeed; for he disobeyed God's express command, in eating the
   forbidden fruit, and so became guilty of the breach of the covenant.
   Nom. But, sir, how could Adam, who had his understanding so sound, and
   his will so free to choose good, be so disobedient to God's express
   command?
   Evan. Though he and his will were both good, yet were they mutually
   good; so that he might stand or fall, at his own election or choice.
   Nom. But why then did not the Lord create him immutable? or, why did he
   not so over-rule him in that action, that he might not have eaten the
   forbidden fruit? [29]
   Evan. The reason why the Lord did not create him immutable, was because
   he would be obeyed out of judgment and free choice, and not by fatal
   necessity and absolute determination; [30] and withal, let me tell you,
   it was not reasonable to restrain God to this point, to make man such
   an one as would not, nor could not sin at all, for it was at his choice
   to create him how he pleased. But why he did not uphold him with
   strength of steadfast continuance; that resteth hidden in God's secret
   council. Howbeit, this we may certainly conclude, that Adam's state was
   such as served to take away from him all excuse; for he received so
   much, that of his own will he wrought his own destruction; [31] because
   this act of his was a willful transgression of a law, under the
   precepts whereof he was as necessarily and righteously subject, if he
   transgressed: for, as being God's creature, he was to be subject to his
   will, so by being God's prisoner, he was as justly subject to his
   wrath; and that so much the more, by how much the precept was most
   just, the obedience more easy, the transgression more reasonable, and
   the punishment more certain.

Chapter I, Section III

   The sinfulness and misery of mankind by the fall.

   Nom. And was Adam's sin and punishment imputed unto his whole
   offspring?

   Evan. Yea, indeed; for says the apostle, (Rom 5:12), "Death passed upon
   all men, for that all have sinned"; or, "in whom all have sinned," that
   is, in Adam. The very truth is, Adam by his fall threw down our whole
   nature [32] headlong into the same destruction, and drowned his whole
   offspring in the same gulf of misery, [33] and the reason is, because,
   by God's appointment, he was not to stand or fall as a single person
   only, but as a common public person, representing all mankind to come
   of him: [34] therefore, as all that happiness, all those gifts, and
   endowments, which were bestowed upon him, were not bestowed upon him
   alone, but also upon the whole nature of man, and as that covenant
   which was made with him, was made with the whole of mankind; even so he
   by breaking covenant lost all, as well for us as for himself. As he
   received all for himself and us, so he lost all both for himself and
   us.

   Nom. Then, sir, it seemeth by Adam's breach of covenant, all mankind
   were brought into a miserable condition?

   Evan. All mankind by the fall of Adam received a twofold damage: First,
   A deprivation of all original goodness. Secondly, An habitual natural
   proneness to all kind of wickedness. For the image of God, after which
   they were created, was forthwith blotted out; and in place of wisdom,
   righteousness, and true holiness, came blindness, uncleanness,
   falsehood, and injustice. The very truth is, our whole nature [35] was
   thereby corrupted, defiled, deformed, depraved, infected, made infirm,
   frail, malignant, full of venom, contrary to God; yea, enemies and
   rebels unto him. So that, says Luther, this is the title we have
   received from Adam: in this one thing we may glory, and in nothing else
   at all; namely, that every infant that is born into this world, is
   wholly in the power of sin, death, Satan, hell, and everlasting
   damnation. Nay, says Musculus, "The whirlpool of man's sin in paradise
   is bottomless and unsearchable."

   Nom. But, sir, methinks it is a strange thing that so small an offence,
   as eating of the forbidden fruit seems to be, should plunge the whole
   of mankind into such a gulf of misery.

   Evan. Though at first glance it seems to be a small offence, yet, if we
   look more wistfully [36] upon the matter it will appear to be an
   exceeding great offence; for thereby intolerable injury was done unto
   God; as, first, His dominion and authority in his holy command was
   violated. Secondly, His justice, truth, and power, in his most
   righteous threatenings, were despised. Thirdly, His most pure and
   perfect image, wherein man was created in righteousness and true
   holiness, was utterly defaced. Fourthly, His glory, which, by an active
   service, the creature should have brought to him, was lost and
   despoiled. Nay, how could there be a greater sin committed than that,
   when Adam, at that one clap, broke all the ten commandments?

   Nom. Did he break all the ten commandments, say you? Sir, I beseech you
   show me wherein.

   Evan. 1. He chose himself another God when he followed the devil.

   2. He idolized and deified his own belly; [37] as the apostle's phrase
   is, "He made his belly his God."

   3. He took the name of God in vain, when he believed him not.

   4. He kept not the rest and estate wherein God had set him.

   5. He dishonoured his Father who was in heaven; and therefore his days
   were not prolonged in that land which the Lord his God had given him.

   6. He massacred himself and all his posterity.

   7. From Eve he was a virgin, but in eyes and mind he committed
   spiritual fornication.

   8. He stole, like Achan, that which God had set aside not to be meddled
   with; and this his stealth is that which troubles all Israel,--the
   whole world.

   9. He bare witness against God, when he believed the witness of the
   devil before him.

   10. He coveted an evil covetousness, like Amnon, which cost him his
   life, (2 Sam 13), and all his progeny. Now, whosoever considers what a
   nest of evils here were committed at one blow, must needs, with
   Musculus, see our case to be such, that we are compelled every way to
   commend the justice of God, [38] and to condemn the sin of our first
   parents, saying, concerning all mankind, as the prophet Hosea does
   concerning Israel, "O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself," (Hosea
   3:9).

Chapter I, Section IV

   No recovery by the law, or covenant of works.

   Nom. But, sir, had it not been possible for Adam both to have helped
   himself and his posterity out of his misery, by renewing the same
   covenant with God, and keeping it so afterwards?

   Evan. No, by no means; for the covenant of works was a covenant no way
   capable of renovation. [39] When he had once broken it, he was gone for
   ever; because it was a covenant between two friends, but now fallen man
   was become an enemy. And besides it was an impossible thing for Adam to
   have performed the conditions which now the justice of God did
   necessarily require at his hands; for he was now become liable for the
   payment of a double debt, viz: the debt of satisfaction for his sin
   committed in time past, and the debt of perfect and perpetual obedience
   for the time to come; and he was utterly unable to pay either of them.

   Nom. Why was he unable to pay the debt of satisfaction for his sin
   committed in time past?

   Evan. Because his sin, in eating the forbidden fruit [for that is the
   sin I mean] [40] was committed against an infinite and eternal God, and
   therefore merited an infinite and eternal satisfaction; which was to be
   either some temporal punishment, equivalent to eternal damnation, or
   eternal damnation itself. Now Adam was a finite creature, therefore,
   between finite and infinite there could be no proportion; so that it
   was impossible for Adam to have made satisfaction by any temporal
   punishment; and if he had undertaken to have satisfied by an eternal
   punishment, he should always have been satisfying, and never have
   satisfied, as is the case of the damned in hell.

   Nom. And why was he unable to pay the debt of perfect and perpetual
   obedience for the time to come?

   Evan. Because his former power to obey was by his fall utterly
   impaired; for thereby his understanding was both enfeebled and drowned
   in darkness; and his will was made perverse, and utterly deprived of
   all power to will well; and his affections were quite set out of order;
   and all things belonging to the blessed life of the soul were
   extinguished, both in him and us; so that he was become impotent, yea,
   dead, and therefore not able to stand in the lowest terms to perform
   the meanest condition. The very truth is, our father Adam falling from
   God, did, by his fall, so dash him and us all in pieces, that there was
   no whole part left, either in him or us, fit to ground such a covenant
   upon. And this the apostle witnesseth, both when he says, "We are of no
   strength"; and, "The law was made weak, because of the flesh," (Rom
   5:6, 8:3).

   Nom. But, sir, might not the Lord have pardoned Adam's sin without
   satisfaction?

   Evan. O no! for justice is essential in God, and it is a righteous
   thing with God, that every transgression receive a just recompense:
   [41] and if recompense be just, it is unjust to pardon sin without
   satisfaction. And though the Lord had pardoned and forgiven his former
   transgression, and so set him in his former condition of amity and
   friendship, yet having no power to keep the law perfectly, he could not
   have continued therein. [42]

   Nom. And is it also impossible for any of his posterity to keep the law
   perfectly?

   Evan. Yea, indeed, it is impossible for any mere man in the time of
   this life to keep it perfectly; yea, though he be a regenerate man; for
   the law requireth of man that he "love the Lord with all his heart,
   soul, and might"; and there is not the holiest man that lives, but he
   is flesh as well as spirit in all parts and faculties of his soul, and
   therefore cannot love the Lord perfectly. Yea, and the law forbiddeth
   all habitual concupiscence, not only saying, "thou shalt not consent to
   lust," but, "thou shalt not lust": it doth not only command the binding
   of lust, but forbids also the being of lust: and who in this case can
   say, "My heart is clean"?

   Ant. Then, Nomista, take notice, I pray, that as it was altogether
   impossible for Adam to return into that holy and happy estate wherein
   he was created, by the same way he went from it, [43] so is it for any
   of his posterity; and therefore, I remember one says very wittingly,
   "The law was Adam's lease when God made him tenant of Eden; the
   conditions of which bond when he kept not, he forfeited himself and all
   for us." God read a lecture of the law to him before he fell, to be a
   hedge to him to keep him in paradise; but when Adam would not keep
   within compass, this law is now become as the flaming sword at Eden's
   gate, to keep him and his posterity out.

Chapter I, Section V

   The covenant of works binding, though broken.

   Nom. But, sir, you know, that when a covenant is broken, the parties
   that were bound are freed and released from their engagements; and
   therefore, methinks, both Adam and his posterity should have been
   released from the covenant of works when it was broken, especially
   considering they have no strength to perform the condition of it.

   Evan. Indeed it is true, in every covenant, if either party fail in his
   duty, and perform not his condition, the other party is thereby freed
   from his part, but the party failing is not freed till the other
   release him; and, therefore, though the Lord be freed from performing
   his condition, that is, from giving to man eternal life, yet so is not
   man from his part; no, though strength to obey be lost, yet man having
   lost it by his own default, the obligation to obedience remains still;
   so that Adam and his offspring are no more discharged of their duties,
   because they have no strength to do them, than a debtor is quitted of
   his bond, because he wants money to pay it. And thus, Nomista, I have,
   according to your desire, endeavoured to help you to the true knowledge
   of the law of works.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] The moral law is an ambiguous term among divines. (1.) The moral
   law is taken from the decalogue, or ten commandments, simply. So the
   law in the ten commandments is owned to be commonly called the moral
   law, Westm. Confess. chap. 19, art. 2, 3. And thus our author has
   hitherto used that term, reckoning the moral law not the covenant of
   works itself, but only the matter of it. (2.) The moral law is taken
   for the ten commandments, having the promise of life, and threatening
   of death annexed to them; that is for the law, or covenant of works.
   Thus the moral law is described to be, "the declaration of the will of
   God to mankind, directing and binding every one to personal, perfect,
   and perpetual conformity and obedience thereunto, in the frame and
   disposition of the whole man, soul and body, and in performance of all
   these duties of holiness and righteousness, which he oweth to God and
   man, promising life upon the fulfilling, and threatening death upon the
   breach of it." Larger Catech. Quest. 93. That this is the covenant of
   works, is clear from Westm. Confess. chap. 19, art. 1, "God gave to
   Adam a law, as a covenant of works, by which he bound him and all his
   posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience; promised
   life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it."
   And this our author owns to be the sense of that term, strictly and
   properly taken; the reason whereof I conceive to be, that the moral
   law, properly signifying the law of manners, answers to the Scripture
   term, the law of works, by which is meant the covenant of works. And if
   he had added, that in this sense believers are delivered from it, he
   had said no more than the Larger Catechism doth, in these words: "They
   that are regenerate, and believe in Christ, be delivered from the moral
   law as a covenant of works," Quest. 97. But, in the meantime, it is
   evident he does not here use that term in this sense; and in the next
   paragraph, save one, he gives a reason why he did not so use it.

   [20] Not a hired servant, for there is a covenant betwixt such an one
   and the master, but a bond-servant, bought with money, of another
   person, or born in the master's house, who is obliged to serve his
   master, and is liable to punishment in case he do not, but cannot
   demand wages, since there is no covenant between them.
   This was the case of mankind, with relation to the Creator, before the
   covenant of works was made.

   [21] The soul approving, embracing, and consenting to the covenant;
   which, without any more, is plain language, though not unto men, yet
   unto God, who knoweth the heart.

   [22] The covenant being revealed to man created after God's own image,
   he could not but perceive the equity and benefit of it; and so heartily
   approve, embrace, accept, and consent to it. And this accepting is
   plainly intimated in Eve's words to the serpent, (Gen 3:2,3), "We may
   eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the
   tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not
   eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."

   [23] Executive faculties and powers, whereby the good known and willed
   was to be done.

   [24] That one commandment was in effect a summary of the whole duty of
   man, the which clearly appears, if one considers that the breach of it
   was a transgressing of all the ten commandments at once, as our author
   afterwards distinctly shows.

   [25] God having given man a being after his own image, a glorious
   excellency, it was his natural duty to make suitable returns thereof
   unto the Giver, in a way of duty, being and acting for him; even as the
   waters, which originally are from the sea, do in brooks and rivers
   return to the sea again. Man, being of God as his first cause, behoved
   to be to him as his chief and ultimate end, (Rom 11:36).

   [26] The punishment of death upon the breach of his commandment
   touching the forbidden fruit.

   [27] That is, an equitable covenant, fair and reasonable.

   [28] The author says, that some learned men think so, and that the
   words, (Gen 3:22), seem to imply so much; but all this amounts not to a
   positive determination of the point. The words are these, "Behold, the
   man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put
   forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live
   for ever," &c. Whether or not these words seem to imply some such
   things, I leave to the judgment of the reader, whom I incline not to
   entertain with mine own or others' conjectures upon this head; but
   three things I take to be plain, and beyond conjecture, in this text,
   (1.) That there is no irony nor scoff here, as many think there is;
   but, on the contrary, a most pathetic lamentation over fallen man. The
   literal version and sense of the former part of the text runs thus:
   "Behold the man that was one of us," &c., compare for the version,
   Lamentations 3:1; Psalm 3:7; and for the sense, Genesis 1:26, 27, "And
   God said, Let us make man in our image.--So God created man in his own
   image," &c. The latter part of the text I would read thus, "And eat
   that he may live for ever." Compare for this version, Exodus 4:23; 1
   Samuel 6:8. It is evident the sentence is broken off abruptly; the
   words, "I will drive him out," being suppressed; even as in the case of
   a father, with sighs, sobs, and tears, putting his son out of doors.
   (2.) That it was God's design, to prevent Adam's eating of the tree of
   life, as he had of the forbidden tree, "lest he take also of the tree
   of life"; thereby mercifully taking care that our fallen father, to
   whom the covenant of grace was now proclaimed, might not, according to
   the corrupt natural inclination of fallen mankind, run back to the
   covenant of works for life and salvation, by partaking of the tree of
   life, a sacrament of that covenant, and so reject the covenant of
   grace, by eating of that tree now, as he had before broken the covenant
   of works, by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. (3.)
   That at this time Adam did think, that by eating of the tree of life he
   might live for ever. Farther I dip not here in this matter.

   [29] These are two distinct questions, both of them natively arising
   from a legal temper of spirit: and I doubt if ever the heart of a
   sinner shall receive a satisfying answer as to either of them, until it
   come to embrace the gospel-way of salvation; taking up its everlasting
   rest in Christ, for wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
   redemption.

   [30] Immutability, properly so called, or absolute unchangeableness, is
   an incommunicable attribute of God, (Mal 3:6, James 1:17); and mutably,
   or changeableness, is so of the nature of a creature, that it should
   cease to be a creature, or a dependent being, if it should cease to be
   mutable. But there is an immutability, improperly so called, which is
   competent to the creature, whereby it is free from being actually
   liable to change in some respect; the which, in reference to man, may
   be considered two ways. (1.) As putting him beyond the hazard of change
   by another hand than his own. (2.) As putting him beyond the hazard of
   change by himself. In the former sense, man was indeed made immutable
   in point of moral goodness; for he could only be made sinful or evil by
   himself, and not by any other. If he had been made immutable in the
   latter sense, that immutability behoved either to have been woven into
   his very nature, or else to have arisen from confirming grace. Now God
   did not create man thus immutable in his nature; which is it that the
   first question aims at; and that for this very good reason, viz: that,
   at that rate, man would have obeyed by fatal necessity and absolute
   determination, as one not having so much as a remote power in his
   nature to change himself. And neither glorified saints, nor angels, are
   thus immutable; their immutability in goodness entirely depending on
   confirming grace. As for immutability by confirming grace, which is it
   that the second question aims at, it is conferred on glorified saints
   and angels; but why it was not afforded to Adam at his creation, our
   author wisely declines to give any reason. "The reason, says he, why
   the Lord did not create him immutable was, because," &c.; but why he
   did not uphold him with strength of steadfast continuance, that resteth
   hidden in God's secret counsel.

   [31] That is, he received so much strength, that it was not of
   weakness, but willfulness, that he destroyed himself.

   [32] That is, all mankind.

   [33] With himself.

   [34] By virtue of the blessing of fruitfulness given before the fall.

   [35] That is, all mankind.

   [36] That is, earnestly.

   [37] That is, as the apostle's, &c.

   [38] That is, to justify God.

   [39] The covenant of works could by no means be renewed by fallen Adam,
   so as thereby to help himself and his posterity out of his misery, the
   which is the only thing in question here; otherwise, indeed, it might
   have been renewed, which is evident by this sad token, that many do
   actually renew it in their covenanting with God, being prompted thereto
   by their ignorance of the high demands of the law, their own utter
   inability, and the way of salvation by Jesus Christ. And from the same
   principle our legalist here makes no question but Adam might have
   renewed it, and kept it too, for the after-time; only, he questions
   whether or not Adam might thereby have helped himself and his posterity
   too, out of the misery they were brought into by his sin.

   [40] That being the sin in which all mankind fell with him, (Rom 5:15).

   [41] (2 Thess 1:6), "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God, to
   recompense tribulation to them that trouble you."--(Heb 2:2), "Every
   transgression and disobedience received a just recompense."

   [42] But would have sinned again, and so fallen under the curse anew.

   [43] Walking back by the way of the covenant of works, which he left by
   his sinning.
   Object. "Do we then make void the law," (Rom 3:31), leaving an
   imputation of dishonour upon it, as a disregarded path, by pretending
   to return anther way? Ans. Sinners being united to Christ by faith,
   return, being carried back the same way they came; only their own feet
   never touch the ground; but the glorious Mediator, sustaining the
   persons of them all, walked every bit of the road exactly, (Gal 4:4,5).
   Thus, in Christ, the way of free grace, and of the law, sweetly meet
   together; and through faith we establish the law.

Chapter II

   Of the Law of Faith, or Covenant of Grace

   Ant. I beseech you, sir, proceed to help us to the true knowledge of
   the law of faith.

   Evan. The law of faith is as much as to say the covenant of grace, or
   the gospel, which signifies good, merry, glad, and joyful tidings; that
   is to say, that God, to whose eternal knowledge all things are present,
   and nothing past or to come, foreseeing man's fall, before all time
   purposed, [44] and in time promised, [45] and in the fullness of time
   performed, [46] the sending of his Son Jesus Christ into the world, to
   help and deliver fallen mankind. [47]

Section I.

   Of the eternal purpose of grace.

   Ant. I beseech you, sir, let us hear more of these things; and first of
   all, show how we are to conceive of God's eternal purpose in sending of
   Jesus Christ.

   Evan. Why, here the learned frame a kind of conflict in God's holy
   attributes; and by a liberty, which the Holy Ghost, from the language
   of holy Scripture, alloweth them, they speak of God after the manner of
   men, as if he were reduced to some straits and difficulties, by the
   cross demands of his several attributes. [48] For Truth and Justice
   stood up and said, that man had sinned, and therefore man must die; and
   so called for the condemnation of a sinful, and therefore worthily a
   cursed creature; or else they must be violated: for thou saidst, [said
   they to God], "In that day that thou eatest of the tree of knowledge of
   good and evil, thou shalt die the death." Mercy, on the other side,
   pleaded for favour, and appeals to the great court in heaven: and there
   it pleads, saying, Wisdom, and power, and goodness, have been all
   manifest in the creation; and anger and justice have been magnified in
   man's misery that he is now plunged into by his fall: but I have not
   yet been manifested. [49] O let favour and compassion be shown towards
   man, woefully seduced and overthrown by Satan! Oh! said they [50] unto
   God, it is a royal thing to relieve the distressed; and the greater any
   one is, the more placable and gentle he ought to be. But Justice
   replied, If I be offended, I must be satisfied and have my right; and
   therefore I require, that man, who hath lost himself by his
   disobedience, should, for remedy, set obedience against it, and so
   satisfy the judgment of God. Therefore the wisdom of God became an
   umpire, and devised a way to reconcile them; concluding, that before
   there could be reconciliation made, there must be two things effected;
   (1.) A satisfaction of God's justice. (2.) A reparation of man's
   nature: which two things must needs be effected by such a middle and
   common person that had both zeal towards God, that he might be
   satisfied; and compassion towards man, that he might be repaired: such
   a person, as, having man's guilt and punishment translated on him,
   might satisfy the justice of God, and as having a fullness of God's
   Spirit and holiness in him, might sanctify and repair the nature of
   man. [51] And this could be none other but Jesus Christ, one of the
   Three Persons of the blessed Trinity; therefore he, by his Father's
   ordination, his own voluntary offering, and the Holy Spirit's
   sanctification, was fitted for the business. Whereupon there was a
   special covenant, or mutual agreement made between God and Christ, as
   is expressed, (Isa 53:10), that if Christ would make himself a
   sacrifice for sin, then he should "see his seed, he should prolong his
   days, and the pleasure of the Lord should prosper by him." So in Psalm
   89:19, the mercies of this covenant between God and Christ, under the
   type of God's covenant with David, are set forth: "Thou spakest in
   vision to thy holy One, and saidst, I have laid help upon One that is
   mighty": or, as the Chaldee expounds it, "One mighty in the law." As if
   God had said concerning his elect, I know that these will break, and
   never be able to satisfy me; but thou art a mighty and substantial
   person, able to pay me, therefore I will look for my debt of thee. [52]
   As Pareus well observes, God did, as it were, say to Christ, What they
   owe me I require all at thy hands. Then said Christ, "Lo, I come to do
   thy will! in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to
   do thy will, O my God! yea, thy law is in my heart," (Psa 40:7,8). Thus
   Christ assented, and from everlasting struck hands with God, to put
   upon him man's person, and to take upon him his name, and to enter in
   his stead in obeying his Father, and to do all for man that he should
   require, and to yield in man's flesh the price of the satisfaction of
   the just judgment of God, and, in the same flesh, to suffer the
   punishment that man had deserved; and this he undertook under the
   penalty that lay upon man to have undergone. [53] And thus was justice
   satisfied, and mercy by the Lord Jesus Christ; and so God took Christ's
   single bond; whence Christ is not only called the "surety of the
   covenant for us," (Heb 7:22), but the covenant itself, (Isa 49:8). And
   God laid all upon him, that he might be sure of satisfaction;
   protesting that he would not deal with us, nor so much as expect any
   payment from us; such was his grace. And thus did our Lord Jesus Christ
   enter into the same covenant of works that Adam did to deliver
   believers from it: [54] he was contented to be under all that
   commanding, revenging authority, which that covenant had over them, to
   free them from the penalty of it; and in that respect, Adam is said to
   be a type of Christ, as you have it, (Rom 5:14), "who was the type of
   him that was to come." To which purpose, the titles which the apostle
   gives these two, Christ and Adam, are exceeding observable: he calls
   Adam the "first man," and Christ our Lord the "second man," (1 Cor
   15:47); speaking of them as if there never had been any more men in the
   world besides these two; thereby making them head and root of all
   mankind, they having, as it were, the rest of the sons of men included
   in them. The first man is called the "earthy man"; the second man,
   Christ, is called the "Lord from heaven," (1 Cor 15:47). The earthy man
   had all the sons of men born into the world included in him, and is so
   called, in conformity unto them, the "first man": [55] the second Man,
   Christ, is called the "Lord from heaven," who had all the elect
   included in him, who are said to be the "first born," and to have their
   "names written in heaven," (Heb 12:23), and therefore are appositely
   called "heavenly men"; so that these two, in God's account, stood for
   all the rest. [56] And thus you see, that the Lord, willing to show
   mercy to the fallen creature, and withal to maintain the authority of
   his law, took such a course as might best manifest his clemency and
   severity. Christ entered into covenant, and became surety for man, and
   so became liable to man's engagements: for he that answers as a surety
   must pay the same sum of money that the debtor oweth.

   And thus have I endeavoured to show you, how we are to conceive of
   God's eternal purpose in sending of Jesus Christ to help and deliver
   fallen mankind.

Chapter II, Section II, 1

   The promise made to Adam.

   Ant. I beseech you, sir, proceed also to the second thing; and first
   tell us, when the Lord began to make a promise to help and deliver
   fallen mankind.

   Evan. Even the same day that he sinned, [57] which, as I suppose, was
   the very same day he was created. [58] For Adam, by his sin, being
   become the child of wrath, and both in body and in soul subject to the
   curse, and seeing nothing due to him but the wrath and vengeance of
   God, was "afraid, and sought to hide himself from the presence of God,"
   (Gen 3:10), whereupon the Lord promised Christ unto him, saying to the
   serpent, "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
   seed and her seed"; he [that is to say, the seed of the woman, for so
   is the Hebrew text] "shall break thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
   heel." This promise of Christ, the woman's seed, (verse 15), was the
   gospel; and the only comfort of Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, and the rest
   of the godly fathers, until the time of Abraham. [59]

   Nom. I pray you, sir, what ground have you to think that Adam fell the
   same day he was created?

   Evan. My ground for this opinion is, Psalm 49:12; which text Mr.
   Ainsworth makes to be the 13th verse, and reads it thus, "But man in
   honour doth not lodge a night; he is likened unto beasts that are
   silenced." [60] That may be minded, says he, both for the first man
   Adam, who continued not in his dignity, and for all his children.

   Ant. But, sir, do you think that Adam and those others did understand
   that promised seed to be meant of Christ?

   Evan. Who can make doubt, but that the Lord had acquainted Adam with
   Christ, betwixt the time of his sinning and the time of his
   sacrificing, though both on one day?

   Ant. But did Adam offer sacrifice?

   Evan. Can you make any question, but that the bodies of those beasts,
   whose skins went for a covering for his body, were immediately before
   offered in sacrifice for his soul? Surely these skins could be none
   other but of beasts slain, and offered in sacrifice; for before Adam
   fell, beasts were not subject to mortality nor slaying. And God's
   clothing of Adam and his wife with skins signified, that their sin and
   shame were covered with Christ's righteousness. And, questionless, the
   Lord had taught him, that his sacrifice did signify his acknowledgment
   of his sin, and that he looked for the Seed of the woman, promised to
   be slain in the evening of the world, thereby to appease the wrath of
   God for his offence; the which, undoubtedly, he acquainted his sons,
   Cain and Abel, with, when he taught them also to offer sacrifice.

   Ant. But how doth it appear that this his sacrificing was the very same
   day that he sinned?

   Evan. It is said, (John 7:3), concerning Christ, "That they sought to
   take him, yet no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet
   come"; but after that when the time of his suffering was at hand, he
   himself said, (John 12:23), "The hour is come"; which day is expressly
   set down by the Evangelist Mark to be the sixth day, and ninth hour of
   that day, when "Christ, through the eternal Spirit, offered up himself
   without spot to God," (Mark 15:34,42). Now, if you compare this with
   Exodus 12:6, you shall find that the paschal lamb, a most lively type
   of Christ, was offered the very same day and hour, even the sixth day,
   and ninth hour of that day, which was at three of the clock in the
   afternoon: and the Scripture testifies, that Adam was created the very
   same sixth day; and gives us ground to think that he sinned the same
   day. And do not the before alleged Scriptures afford us warrant to
   believe that it was the very same hour of that day, (Gen 1:26); when
   Christ entered mystically and typically upon the work of redemption, in
   being offered as a sacrifice for Adam's sin? [61] And surely we may
   suppose, that the covenant [as you heard] being broken between God and
   Adam, justice would not have admitted of one hour's respite, before it
   had proceeded to execution, to the destruction both of Adam and the
   whole creation, had not Christ, at that very time, stood as the ram [or
   rather the lamb] in the bush, and stepped in to perform the work of the
   covenant. And hence I conceive it is, that Saint [62] John calls him
   the "Lamb slain" from the beginning of the world, [63] (Rev 13:8). For
   as the first state of creation was confirmed by the covenant which God
   made with man, and all creatures were to be upheld by means of
   observing the law and condition of that covenant; so that covenant
   being broken by man, the world should have come to ruin, had it not
   been, as it were, created anew, and upheld by the covenant of grace in
   Christ.

   Ant. Then, sir, you think that Adam was saved?

   Evan. The Hebrew doctors hold that Adam was a repentant sinner, and
   say, that he was by wisdom, [that is to say, by faith in Christ,]
   brought out of his fall; yea, and the Church of God doth hold, and that
   for necessary causes, that he was saved by the death of Christ; yea,
   says Mr. Vaughan, it is certain he believed the promise concerning
   Christ, in whose commemoration he offered continual sacrifice; and in
   the assurance thereof, he named his wife Hevah, that is to say, life,
   [64] and he called his son Seth, settled or persuaded in Christ.

   Ant. Well, now, I am persuaded that Adam did understand this seed of
   the woman to be meant of Christ.

   Evan. Assure yourself, that not only Adam, but all the rest of the
   godly fathers did so understand it, as is manifest in that the Targum,
   or Chaldee Bible, which is the ancient translation of Jerusalem, has it
   thus: "Between thy son and her son"; adding further, by way of comment,
   "So long, O serpent, as the woman's children keep the law, they kill
   thee! and when they cease to do so, thou stingest them in the heel, and
   hast power to hurt them much; but whereas for their harm there is a
   sure remedy, for thee there is none; for in the last days they shall
   crush thee all to pieces, by means of Christ their king." And this was
   it which did support and uphold their faith until the time of Abraham.

Chapter II, Section II, 2

   The promise renewed to Abraham.

   Ant. What followed then?

   Evan. Why, then, the promise was turned into a covenant with Abraham
   and his seed, and oftentimes repeated, that in his seed all nations
   should be blessed, [65] (Gen 12:3, 18:18, 22:18); which promise and
   covenant was the very voice itself of the gospel, it being a true
   testimony of Jesus Christ; as the apostle Paul beareth witness, saying,
   The Scripture foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through
   faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, (Gal 3:8), saying, "In
   thee shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." And the better to
   confirm Abraham's faith in this promise of Christ, it is said, (Gen
   14:19), that Melchisedec came forth and met him, and blessed him. Now,
   says the apostle, (Heb 7:1-3, 6:20), "This Melchisedec was a priest of
   the most high God, and king of righteousness, and king of peace,
   without father and without mother; and so like unto the Son of God, who
   is a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec"; and both king of
   righteousness and king of peace, (Jer 23:6, Isa 9:6); yea, and without
   father as touching his manhood, and without mother as touching his
   godhead. Whereby we are given to understand, that it was the purpose of
   God that Melchisedec should, in these particulars, resemble the person
   and office of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and so, by God's own
   appointment, be a type of him to Abraham, to ratify and confirm the
   promise made to him and his seed, in respect of the eternal covenant,
   [66] namely, that he and his believing seed should be so blessed in
   Christ, as Melchisedec had blessed him. [67] Nay, let me tell you more,
   some have thought it most probable, yea, and have said, if we search
   out this truth without partiality, we shall find that this Melchisedec,
   which appeared unto Abraham, was none other than the Son of God,
   manifest by a special dispensation and privilege unto Abraham in the
   flesh, who is therefore said to have "seen his day and rejoiced." [68]
   (John 8:56). Moreover, in Genesis 15, we read that the Lord did again
   confirm this covenant with Abraham; for when Abraham had divided the
   beasts, God came between the parts like a smoking furnace and a burning
   lamp, which, [69] as some have thought, did primarily typify the
   torment and rending of Christ; and the furnace and fiery lamp did
   typify the wrath of God which ran between, and yet did not consume the
   rent and torn nature. And the blood of circumcision did typify the
   blood of Christ; [70] and the resolved sacrificing of Isaac on Mount
   Moriah, by God's appointment, did prefigure and foreshow, that by the
   offering up of Christ, the promised seed, in the very same place, all
   nations should be saved. Now this covenant, thus made and confirmed
   with Abraham, was renewed with Isaac, (Gen 26:4), and made known unto
   Jacob by Jesus Christ himself; for that man which wrestled with Jacob
   was none other but the man Christ Jesus; for himself said, that Jacob
   should be called Israel, a wrestler and prevailer with God; and Jacob
   called the name of the place Peniel, because he had "seen God face to
   face," (Gen 32:28,30). And Jacob left it by his last will unto his
   children in these words, "The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor
   a lawgiver from between his feet, till Shiloh come," (Gen 49:10); that
   is to say, of Judah shall kings come one after another, and many in
   number, till at last the Lord Jesus come, who is King of kings, and
   Lord of lords; or, as the Targum of Jerusalem and Onkelos do translate
   it, until Christ the Anointed come.

   Nom. But, sir, are you sure that this promised seed was meant of
   Christ?

   Evan. The apostle puts that out of doubt, (Gal 3:16), saying, "Now unto
   Abraham and to his seed were the promises made. [71] He says not--and
   to seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ."
   [72] And so no doubt but these godly patriarchs did understand it.

   Ant. But, sir, the great promise that was made to them, as I conceive,
   and which they seemed to have most regard to, was the land of Canaan.

   Evan. There is no doubt but that these godly patriarchs did see their
   heavenly inheritance [by Christ] through the promise of the land of
   Canaan, as the apostle testifies of Abraham, (Heb 11:9,10), saying, "He
   sojourned in a strange country, and looked for a city having
   foundations, whose builder and maker is God." "Whereby it is evident,"
   says Calvin, [Instit. p. 204,] "that the height and eminency of
   Abraham's faith was the looking for an everlasting life in heaven." The
   like testimony he gives of Sarah, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, "All these
   died in the faith," [73] (Heb 11:13); implying that they did not expect
   to receive the fruit of the promise till after death. And, therefore in
   all their travails they had before their eyes the blessedness of the
   life to come; and which caused old Jacob to say at his death, "Lord, I
   have waited for thy salvation," (Gen 49:18). The which speech the
   Chaldee paraphrase expounds thus, "Our father Jacob said not, I expect
   the salvation of Gideon, son of Joash, which is a temporal salvation,
   nor the salvation of Samson, son of Manoah, which is a transitory
   salvation, but the salvation of Christ, the Son of David, who shall
   come, and bring unto himself the sons of Israel, whose salvation my
   soul desireth." And so you see that this covenant, made with Abraham in
   Christ, was the comfort and support of these and the rest of the godly
   fathers, until their departure out of Egypt.

   Ant. And what followed then?

   Evan. Why, then, Christ Jesus was most clearly manifested unto them in
   the passover lamb; for, as that lamb was to be without spot or blemish,
   (Exo 12:5), even so was Christ, (1 Peter 1:19). And as that lamb was
   taken up the tenth day of the first new moon in March, even so on the
   very same day of the same month came Christ to Jerusalem to suffer his
   passion. And as that lamb was killed on the fourteenth day at even,
   just then, on the same day, and at the same hour, did Christ give up
   the ghost; and as the blood of that lamb was to be sprinkled on the
   Israelites' doors, (Exo 12:7), even so is the blood of Christ sprinkled
   on believers' hearts by faith, (1 Peter 1:2) And their deliverance out
   of Egypt was a figure of their redemption by Christ, [74] their passing
   through the Red Sea was a type of baptism, [75] when Christ should come
   in the flesh, and their manna in the wilderness, and water out of the
   rock, did resemble the sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and hence it is
   that the apostle says, (1 Cor 10:2- 4), "They did all eat the same
   spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for they
   drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was
   Christ." And when they were come to Mount Sinai, the Lord delivered the
   ten commandments unto them.

Chapter II, Section II, 3

   The law, as the covenant of works, added to the promise.

   Ant. But whether were the ten commandments, as they were delivered to
   them on Mount Sinai, the covenant of works or no?

   Evan. They were delivered to them as the covenant of works. [76]

   Nom. But, by your favour, sir, you know that these people were the
   posterity of Abraham, and therefore under that covenant of grace which
   God made with their father; and therefore I do not think that they were
   delivered to them as the covenant of works; for you know the Lord never
   delivers the covenant of works to any that are under the covenant of
   grace.

   Evan. Indeed it is true, the Lord did manifest so much love to the body
   of this nation, that all the natural seed of Abraham were externally,
   and by profession, under the covenant of grace made with their father
   Abraham; though, it is to be feared, many of them were still under the
   covenant of works made with their father Adam. [77]

   Nom. But, sir, you know, in the preface to the ten commandments, the
   Lord calls himself by the name of their God in general; and therefore
   it should seem that they were all of them the people of God. [78]

   Evan. That is nothing to the purpose; [79] for many wicked and ungodly
   men, being in the visible church, and under the external covenant, are
   called the chosen of God, and the people of God, though they be not so.
   In like manner were many of these Israelites called the people of God,
   though indeed they were not so.

   Nom. But, sir, was the same covenant of works made with them that was
   made with Adam?

   Evan. For the general substance of the duty, the law delivered on Mount
   Sinai, and formerly engraven on man's heart, was one and the same; so
   that at Mount Sinai the Lord delivered no new thing, only it came more
   gently to Adam before his fall, but after his fall came thunder with
   it.

   Nom. Ay, sir, but as yourself said, the ten commandments, as they were
   written in Adam's heart, were but the matter of the covenant of works,
   and not the covenant itself, till the form was annexed to them, that is
   to say, till God and man were thereupon agreed: now, we do not find
   that God and these people did agree upon any such terms at Mount Sinai.

   Evan. No; [80] say you so? do you not remember that the Lord consented
   and agreed, when he said, (Lev 18:5), "Ye shall therefore keep my
   statutes and my judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them";
   and in Deuteronomy 27:26, when he said, "Cursed is he that confirmeth
   not all the words of this law, to do them?" And do you not remember
   that the people consented, (Exo 19:8), and agreed, when they said, "All
   that the Lord hath spoken we will do?" And doth not the apostle Paul
   give evidence that these words were the form of the covenant of works,
   when he says, (Rom 10:5), "Moses describeth that righteousness which is
   of the law, that the man that doeth these things shall live in them";
   and when he says, (Gal 3:10), "For it is written, Cursed is every one
   that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do
   them?" [81] And in Deuteronomy 4:13, Moses, in express terms, calls it
   a covenant, saying, "And he declared unto you his covenant, which he
   commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments, and he wrote them
   upon tables of stone." Now, this was not the covenant of grace; for
   Moses afterwards, (Deut 5:3), speaking of this covenant, says, "God
   made not this covenant with your fathers, but with you"; and by
   "fathers" all the patriarchs unto Adam may be meant, [says Mr.
   Ainsworth,] who had the promise of the covenant of Christ. [82]
   Therefore, if it had been the covenant of grace, he would have said,
   God did make this covenant with them, rather than that he did not. [83]

   Nom. And do any of our godly and modern writers agree with you on this
   point?

   Evan. Yes, indeed. Polonus says, "The covenant of works is that in
   which God promiseth everlasting life unto a man that in all respects
   performeth perfect obedience to the law of works, adding thereunto
   threatenings of eternal death, if he shall not perform perfect
   obedience thereto. God made this covenant in the beginning with the
   first man Adam, whilst he was in the first estate of integrity: the
   same covenant God did repeat and make again by Moses with the people of
   Israel." And Dr. Preston, on the New Covenant, [p. 317,] says, "The
   covenant of works runs in these terms, 'Do this and thou shalt live,
   and I will be thy God.' This was the covenant which was made with Adam,
   and the covenant that is expressed by Moses in the moral law." And Mr.
   Pemble [Vind. Fid. p. 152] says, "By the covenant of works, we
   understand what we call in one word 'the law,' namely, that means of
   bringing man to salvation, which is by perfect obedience unto the will
   of God. Hereof there are also two several administrations; the first is
   with Adam before his fall, when immortality and happiness were promised
   to man, and confirmed by an external symbol of the tree of life, upon
   condition that he continued obedient to God, as well in all other
   things, as in that particular commandment of not eating of the tree of
   knowledge of good and evil. The second administration of this covenant
   was the renewing thereof with the Israelites at Mount Sinai; where,
   after the light of nature began to grow darker, and corruption had in
   time worn out the characters of religion and virtue first grave in
   man's heart, [84] God revived the law by a compendious and full
   declaration of all duties required of man towards God or his neighbour,
   expressed in the decalogue; according to the tenor of which law God
   entered into covenant with the Israelites, promising to be their God in
   bestowing upon them all blessings of life and happiness, upon condition
   that they would be his people, obeying all things that he had
   commanded; which condition they accepted of, promising an absolute
   obedience, (Exo 19:8), 'all things which the Lord hath said we will
   do'; and also submitting themselves to all punishment in case they
   disobeyed, saying, 'Amen' to the curse of the law, 'Cursed be every one
   that confirmeth not all the words of the law: and all the people shall
   say, Amen.'" And Mr. Walker, on the Covenant, [p. 128,] says, that "the
   first part of the covenant, which God made with Israel at Horeb, was
   nothing else but a renewing of the old covenant of works, [85] which
   God made with Adam in paradise." And it is generally laid down by our
   divines, that we are by Christ delivered from the law as it is a
   covenant. [86]

   Nom. But, sir, were the children of Israel at this time better able to
   perform the condition of the covenant of works, than either Adam or any
   of the old patriarchs were, that God renewed it now with them, rather
   than before?

   Evan. No, indeed; God did not renew it with them now, and not before,
   because they were better able to keep it, but because they had more
   need to be made acquainted what the covenant of works is, than those
   before. For though it is true the ten commandments, which were at first
   perfectly written in Adam's heart, were much obliterated [87] by his
   fall, yet some impressions and relics thereof still remained; [88] and
   Adam himself was very sensible of his fall, and the rest of the fathers
   were helped by tradition; [89] and, says Cameron, "God did speak to the
   patriarchs from heaven, yea, and he spake unto them by his angels";
   [90] but now, by this time, sin had almost obliterated and defaced the
   impressions of the law written in their hearts; [91] and by their being
   so long in Egypt, they were so corrupted, that the instructions and
   ordinances of their fathers were almost worn out of mind; and their
   fall in Adam was almost forgotten, as the apostle testifies, (Rom
   5:13,14), saying, "Before the time of the law, sin was in the world,
   but sin is not imputed when there is no law." Nay, in that long course
   of time betwixt Adam and Moses, men had forgotten what was sin; so,
   although God had made a promise of blessing to Abraham, and to all his
   seed, that would plead interest in it, [92] yet these people at this
   time were proud and secure, and heedless of their estate; and though
   "sin was in them, and death reigned over them," yet they being without
   a law to evidence this sin and death unto their consciences, [93] they
   did not impute it unto themselves, they would not own it, nor charge
   themselves with it; and so, by consequence, found no need of pleading
   the promise made to Abraham; [94] (Rom 5:20), therefore, "the law
   entered," that Adam's offence and their own actual transgression might
   abound, so that now the Lord saw it needful, that there should be a new
   edition and publication of the covenant of works, the sooner to compel
   the elect unbelievers to come to Christ, the promised seed, and that
   the grace of God in Christ to the elect believers might appear the more
   exceeding glorious. So that you see the Lord's intention therein was,
   that they, by looking upon this covenant might be put in mind what was
   their duty of old, when they were in Adam's loins; yea, and what was
   their duty still, if they would stand to that covenant, and so go the
   old and natural way to work; yea, and hereby they were also to see what
   was their present infirmity in not doing their duty: [95] that so they
   seeing an impossibility of obtaining life by that way of works, first
   appointed in paradise, they might be humbled, and more heedfully mind
   the promise made to their father Abraham, and hasten to lay hold on the
   Messiah, or promised seed.

   Nom. Then, sir, it seems that the Lord did not renew the covenant of
   works with them, to the intent that they should obtain eternal life by
   their yielding obedience to it?

   Evan. No, indeed; God never made the covenant of works with any man
   since the fall, either with expectation that he should fulfil it, [96]
   or to give him life by it; for God never appoints any thing to an end,
   to the which it is utterly unsuitable and improper. Now the law, as it
   is the covenant of works, is become weak and unprofitable to the
   purpose of salvation; [97] and, therefore, God never appointed it to
   man, since the fall, to that end. And besides, it is manifest that the
   purpose of God, in the covenant made with Abraham, was to give life and
   salvation by grace and promise; and, therefore, his purpose in renewing
   the covenant of works, was not, neither could be, to give life and
   salvation by working; for then there would have been contradictions in
   the covenants, and instability in him that made them. Wherefore let no
   man imagine that God published the covenant of works on Mount Sinai, as
   though he had been mutable, and so changed his determination in that
   covenant made with Abraham; neither, yet let any man suppose, that God
   now in process of time had found out a better way for man's salvation
   than he knew before: for, as the covenant of grace made with Abraham
   had been needless, if the covenant of works made with Adam would have
   given him and his believing seed life; so, after the covenant of grace
   was once made, it was needless to renew the covenant of works, to the
   end that righteousness of life should be had by the observation of it.
   The which will yet more evidently appear, if we consider, that the
   apostle, speaking of the covenant of works as it was given on Mount
   Sinai, says, "It was added because of transgressions," (Gal 3:19). It
   was not set up as a solid rule of righteousness, as it was given to
   Adam in paradise, but was added or put to; [98] it was not set up as a
   thing in gross by itself.

   Nom. Then, sir, it should seem that the covenant of works was added to
   the covenant of grace, to make it more complete.

   Evan. O no! you are not so to understand the apostle, as though it were
   added by way of ingrediency as a part of the covenant of grace, as if
   that covenant had been incomplete without the covenant of works; for
   then the same covenant should have consisted of contradictory
   materials, and so it should have overthrown itself; for, says the
   apostle, "If it be by grace, then it is no more of works; otherwise
   grace is no more grace: but if it be of works, then it is no more of
   grace; otherwise work is no more work," (Rom 11:6). But it was added by
   way of subserviency and attendance, the better to advance and make
   effectual the covenant of grace; so that although the same covenant
   that was made with Adam was renewed on Mount Sinai, yet I say still, it
   was not for the same purpose. For this was it that God aimed at, in
   making the covenant of works with man in innocency, to have that which
   was his due from man: [99] but God made it with the Israelites for no
   other end, than that man, being thereby convinced of his weakness,
   might flee to Christ. So that it was renewed only to help forward and
   introduce another and a better covenant; and so to be a manuduction
   unto Christ, viz: to discover sin, to waken the conscience, and to
   convince them of their own impotency, and so drive them out of
   themselves to Christ. Know it then, I beseech you, that all this while
   there was no other way of life given, either in whole, or in part, than
   the covenant of grace. All this while God did but pursue the design of
   his own grace; and, therefore, was there no inconsistency either in
   God's will or acts; only such was his mercy, that he subordinated the
   covenant of works, and made it subservient to the covenant of grace,
   and so to tend to evangelical purposes.

   Nom. But yet, sir, methinks it is somewhat strange that the Lord should
   put them upon doing the law, and also promise them life for doing, and
   yet never intend it.

   Evan. Though he did so, yet did he neither require of them that which
   was unjust, nor yet dissemble with them in the promise; for the Lord
   may justly require perfect obedience at all men's hands, by virtue of
   that covenant which was made with them in Adam; and if any man could
   yield perfect obedience to the law, both in doing and suffering, he
   should have eternal life; for we may not deny [says Calvin] but that
   the reward of eternal salvation belongeth to the upright obedience of
   the law. [100] But God knew well enough that the Israelites were never
   able to yield such an obedience: and yet he saw it meet to propound
   eternal life to them upon these terms; that so he might speak to them
   in their own humour, as indeed it was meet: for they swelled with mad
   assurance in themselves, saying, "All that the Lord commandeth we will
   do," and be obedient, (Exo 19:8). Well, said the Lord, if you will
   needs be doing, why here is a law to be kept; and if you can fully
   observe the righteousness of it, you shall be saved: sending them of
   purpose to the law, to awaken and convince them, to sentence and humble
   them, and to make them see their own folly in seeking for life that
   way; in short, to make them see the terms under which they stood, that
   so they might be brought out of themselves, and expect nothing from the
   law, in relation to life, but all from Christ. For how should a man see
   his need of life by Christ, if he do not first see that he is fallen
   from the way of life? and how should he understand how far he had
   strayed from the way of life, unless he do first find what is that way
   of life? Therefore it was needful that the Lord should deal with them
   after such a manner to drive them out of themselves, and from all
   confidence in the works of the law; that so, by faith in Christ, they
   might obtain righteousness and life. And just so did our Saviour also
   deal with that young expounder of the law, (Matt 19:16), who it seems,
   was sick of the same disease: "Good Master," says he, "what shall I do
   that I may inherit eternal life?" He doth not, says Calvin, simply ask,
   which way or by what means he should come to eternal life, but what
   good he should do to get it; whereby it appears, that he was a proud
   justiciary, one that swelled in fleshly opinion that he could keep the
   law, and be saved by it; therefore he is worthily sent to the law to
   work himself weary, and to see need to come to Christ for rest. And
   thus you see that the Lord, to the former promises made to the fathers,
   added a fiery law; which he gave from Mount Sinai, in thundering and
   lightning, and with a terrible voice, to the stubborn and stiff-necked
   Israel; whereby to break and tame them, and to make them sigh and long
   for the promised Redeemer.

Chapter II, Section II, 4

   The promise and covenant with Abraham, renewed with the Israelites.

   Ant. And, sir, did the law produce this effect in them?

   Evan. Yea, indeed, it did; as will appear, if you consider, that
   although, before the publishing of this covenant, they were exceeding
   proud and confident of their own strength to do all that the Lord would
   have them do; yet when the Lord came to deal with them as men under the
   covenant of works, in showing himself a terrible judge sitting on the
   throne of justice, like a mountain burning with fire, summoning them to
   come before him by the sound of a trumpet, [yet not to touch the
   mountain without a mediator,] (Heb 12:19,20), they were not able to
   endure the voice of words, nor yet to abide that which was commanded,
   insomuch, as Moses himself did fear and quake; and they did all of them
   so fear, and shake, and shiver, that their peacock feathers were now
   pulled down. This terrible show wherein God gave his law on Mount
   Sinai, says Luther, did represent the use of the law: there was in the
   people of Israel that came out of Egypt a singular holiness; they
   gloried and said, "We are the people of God; we will do all that the
   Lord commandeth." Moreover, Moses sanctified them, and bade them wash
   their garments, and purify themselves, and prepare themselves against
   the third day: there was not one of them but was full of holiness. The
   third day, Moses bringeth the people out of their tents to the mountain
   in the sight of the Lord, that they might hear his voice. What followed
   then? why, when they beheld the horrible sight of the mountain smoking
   and burning, the black clouds and the lightnings flashing up and down
   in this horrible darkness, and heard the sound of the trumpet blowing
   long, and waxing louder and louder, they were afraid, and standing afar
   off, they said not to Moses as before, "All that the Lord commandeth we
   will do; but talk thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God talk
   with us, lest we die." So that now they saw they were sinners, and had
   offended God; and, therefore, stood in need of a mediator to negotiate
   peace, and entreat for reconciliation between God and them; and the
   Lord highly approved of their words, as you may see, (Deut 5:28), where
   Moses, repeating what they had said, adds further: "The Lord heard the
   voice of your word, when ye spake to me, and the Lord said unto me, I
   have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have
   spoken unto thee, they have well said, all that they have spoken," viz:
   in desiring a mediator. Wherefore, I pray you, take notice, that they
   were not commended for saying, "All that the Lord commandeth we will
   do." "No," says a godly writer, "they were not praised for any other
   thing, than for desiring a mediator"; [101] whereupon the Lord promised
   Christ unto them, even as Moses testifies, saying, "The Lord thy God
   shall raise up unto thee a prophet like unto me, from among you, even
   of your brethren; unto him shall you hearken, according to all that
   thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb, in the day of the
   assembly, when thou saidst, Let me hear the voice of the Lord my God no
   more, nor see this great fire any more, that I die not: and the Lord
   said unto me, They have well spoken, I will raise them up a prophet
   from among their brethren like unto thee, and I will put my words in
   his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I command him"; and to
   assure us that Christ was the prophet here spoken of, he himself says
   unto the Jews, (John 5:46), "If you have believed Moses, you would have
   believed me; for he wrote of me"; and that this was it which he wrote
   of him, the apostle Peter witnesses, (Acts 3:22); and so doth the
   martyr Stephen, (Acts 7:37). Thus you see, when the Lord had, by means
   of the covenant of works made with Adam, humbled them, and made them
   sigh for Christ the promised Seed, he renewed the promise with them,
   yea, and the covenant of grace made with Abraham. [102]

   Ant. I pray, sir, how doth it appear that the Lord renewed that
   covenant with them?

   Evan. It plainly appears in this, that the Lord gave them by Moses the
   Levitical laws, and ordained the tabernacle, the ark, and the mercy-
   seat, which were all types of Christ. Moreover, (Lev 1:1), "The Lord
   called unto Moses and spake unto him out of the tabernacle," [103] and
   commanded him to write the Levitical laws, and the tabernacle
   ordinances; telling him withal, (Exo 34:27), "that after the tenor of
   these words, he had made a covenant with him, and with Israel." [104]
   So Moses wrote those laws, (Exo 24:4), not in tables of stone, but in
   an authentical book, [105] says Ainsworth, called the Book of the
   Covenant, which book Moses read in the audience of the people, (Exo
   24:7), and the people consented unto it. Then Moses having before sent
   young men of the children of Israel, who were first-born, [106] and
   therefore priests until the time of the Levites, to offer sacrifices of
   burnt-offerings and peace-offerings unto the Lord, "took the blood and
   sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant
   which the Lord hath made with you concerning these things"; whereby
   they were taught, that by virtue of blood, this covenant betwixt God
   and them was confirmed, and that Christ, by his blood shed, should
   satisfy for their sins; for, indeed, the covenant of grace was, before
   the coming of Christ, sealed by his blood in types and figures. [107]

Chapter II, Section II, 5

   The covenant of grace under the Mosaic dispensation.

   Ant. But, sir, was this every way the same covenant that was made with
   Abraham?

   Evan. Surely I do believe, that reverend Bullinger spake very truly,
   when he said that God gave unto these people no other religion, in
   nature, substance, and matter itself, differing from the laws of their
   fathers; though, for some respects, he added thereunto many ceremonies
   and certain ordinances; the which he did to keep their minds in
   expectation of the coming of Christ whom he had promised unto them; and
   to confirm them in looking for him, lest they should wax faint. And as
   the Lord did thus by the ceremonies, as it were, lead them by the hand
   to Christ; so did he make them a promise of the land of Canaan, and
   outward prosperity in it, as a type of heaven, and eternal happiness;
   so that the Lord dealt with them as with children in their infancy and
   under age, leading them on by the help of earthly things, to heavenly
   and spiritual, because they were but young and tender, [108] and had
   not that measure and abundance of the Spirit which he had bestowed upon
   his people now under the gospel.

   Ant. And, sir, do you think that these Israelites at this time did see
   Christ and salvation by him in these types and shadows?

   Evan. Yes, there is no doubt but Moses and the rest of the believers
   among the Jews did see Christ in them, "For," says Tindal, "though all
   the sacrifices and ceremonies had a star-light of Christ, yet some of
   them had the light of the broad day, a little before the sun-rising";
   and did express him, with the circumstances and virtue of his death, as
   plainly, as if his passion had been acted upon a scaffold: "Insomuch,"
   says he, "that I am fully persuaded, and cannot but believe, that God
   had showed Moses the secrets of Christ, and the very manner of his
   death aforehand"; and, therefore, no doubt but that they offered their
   sacrifices by faith in the Messiah, as the apostle testifies of Abel,
   (Heb 11:4). I say, there is no question but every spiritual believing
   Jew, when he brought his sacrifice to be offered, and, according to the
   Lord's command, laid his hands upon it whilst it was yet alive, (Lev
   1:4), did, from his heart, acknowledge that he himself had deserved to
   die; but by the mercy of God he was saved, [109] and his desert laid
   upon the beast; [110] and as that beast was to die, and be offered in
   sacrifice for him, so did he believe that the Messiah should come and
   die for him, upon whom he put his hands, that is, laid all his
   iniquities by the hand of faith. [111] So that, as Beza on Job 1 says,
   "The sacrifices were to them holy mysteries, in which, as in certain
   glasses, they did both see themselves to their own condemnation before
   God, [112] and also beheld the mercy of God in the promised Messiah, in
   time to be exhibited": "And therefore," says Calvin, Institut. p. 239,
   "the sacrifices and satisfactory offerings were called Ashemoth, which
   word properly signifies sin itself, to show that Jesus Christ was to
   come and perform a perfect expiation, by giving his own soul to be an
   asham, that is, a satisfactory oblation."

   Wherefore, you may assure yourself, that as Christ was always set
   before the fathers in the Old Testament, to whom they might direct
   their faith, and as God never put them in hope of any grace or mercy,
   nor ever showed himself good unto them without Christ: [113] even so
   the godly in the Old Testament knew Christ by whom they did enjoy these
   promises of God, and were joined to him. [114] And, indeed, the promise
   of salvation never stood firm till it came to Christ. [115] And there
   was their comfort in all their troubles and distresses, according as it
   is said of Moses, (Heb 11:26,27), "He endured as seeing him who is
   invisible, [116] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than
   the treasures of Egypt, for he had respect to the recompense of
   reward."

   And so, as Ignatius says, the prophets were Christ's servants, who,
   foreseeing him in spirit, both waited for him as their master, and
   looked for him as their Lord and Saviour, saying, "He shall come and
   save us."

   And so says Calvin, Institut. p. 207, "So oft as the prophets speak of
   the blessedness of that faithful, the perfect image that they have
   painted thereof was such as might ravish men's minds out of the earth,
   and of necessity raise them up to the consideration of the felicity of
   the life to come"; so that we may assuredly conclude, with Luther, that
   all the fathers, prophets, and holy kings, were righteous, and saved by
   faith in Christ to come; and so, indeed, as Calvin says, Institut. p.
   198, "were partakers of all one salvation with us."

   Ant. But, sir, the Scriptures seem to hold forth as though they were
   saved one way, and we another way; for you know the prophet Jeremiah
   makes mention of a twofold covenant; therefore it is somewhat strange
   to me, that they should be partakers of one way of salvation with us.

   Evan. Indeed, it is true, the Lord did bequeath unto the fathers,
   righteousness, life, and eternal salvation, in and through Christ the
   Mediator, being not yet come in the flesh, but promised: and unto us in
   the New Testament he gives and bequeaths them to us in and through
   Christ, being already come, and having actually purchased them for us;
   and the covenant of grace was, before the coming of Christ, sealed by
   his blood in types and figures; and at his death in his flesh, [117] it
   was sealed and ratified by his very blood, actually, and in very deed
   shed for our sins. And the old covenant, in respect of the outward form
   and manner of sealing, was temporary and changeable; and therefore the
   types ceased, and only the substance remains firm; but the seals of the
   new are unchangeable, being commemorative, and shall show the Lord's
   death until his coming again. And their covenant did first and chiefly
   promise earthly blessings, [118] and in and under these it did signify
   and promise all spiritual blessings and salvation; but our covenant
   promises, Christ and his blessings in the first place, and after them
   earthly blessings.

   These, and some other circumstantial differences in regard to
   administration, there were betwixt their way of salvation, or covenant
   of grace, and ours; which moved the author to the Hebrews, (Heb 8:8),
   to call theirs old, and ours new; but, in regard to substance, they
   were all one and the very same; [119] for in all covenants this is a
   certain rule, "If the subject matter, the fruit and the conditions, be
   the same, then is the covenant the same": but in these covenants Jesus
   Christ is the subject matter of both, salvation the fruit of both, and
   faith the condition of both: [120] therefore, I say, though they be
   called two, yet they are but one; the which is confirmed by two
   faithful witnesses: the one is the apostle Peter, who says, (Acts
   15:11), "We believe, that through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
   we shall be saved even as they"; meaning the fathers in the Old
   Testament, as is evident in the verse next before. The other is the
   apostle Paul, who says, (Gal 3:6,7), "Abraham believed God, and it was
   accounted to him for righteousness, know ye, therefore, that they which
   are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham": by which
   testimony, says Luther, on the Galatians, p. 116, "we may see that the
   faith of our fathers in the Old Testament, and ours in the New, is all
   one in substance."

   Ant. But could they that lived so long before Christ, apprehend his
   righteousness by faith for their justification and salvation?

   Evan. Yea, indeed; for as Mr. Forbes, on Justification, p. 90, truly
   says, it is as easy for faith to apprehend righteousness to come, as it
   is to apprehend righteousness that is past: wherefore, as Christ's
   birth, obedience, and death, were in the Old Testament as effectual to
   save sinners, as they are now; so all the faithful forefathers, from
   the beginning, did partake of the same grace with us, by believing in
   the same Jesus Christ, and so were justified by his righteousness, and
   saved eternally by faith in him. It was by virtue of the death of
   Christ, that Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and
   Elias was taken up into heaven by virtue of Christ's resurrection and
   ascension. So that from the world's beginning to the end thereof, the
   salvation of sinners is only by Jesus Christ; as it is written, "Jesus
   Christ, the same yesterday, and today, and for ever," (Heb 13:8).

   Ant. Why, then, sir, it seems that those who were saved amongst the
   Jews, were not saved by the works of the law?

   Evan. No, indeed; they were neither justified nor saved, either by the
   works of the moral law, or the ceremonial law. For, as you heard
   before, the moral law being delivered unto them with great terror, and
   under most dreadful penalties, they did find in themselves an
   impossibility of keeping it; and so were driven to seek help of a
   Mediator, even Jesus Christ, of whom Moses was to them a typical
   mediator: [121] so that the moral law did drive them to the ceremonial
   law, which was their gospel, and their Christ in a figure; for that the
   ceremonies did prefigure Christ, direct unto him, and require faith in
   him, is a thing acknowledged and confessed by all men.

   Nom. But, sir, I suppose, though believers among the Jews were not
   justified and saved by the works of the law, yet was it a rule of their
   obedience?

   Evan. It is very true, indeed: the law of the ten commandments was a
   rule for their obedience; [122] yet not as it came from Mount Sinai;
   [123] but rather as it came from Mount Zion; not as it was the law or
   covenant of works, but as it was the law of Christ. The which will
   appear, if you consider, that after the Lord had renewed with them the
   covenant of grace, as you heard before, (Exodus 24 at the beginning)
   the Lord said unto Moses, (verse 12), "Come up to me into the mount,
   and be there, and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law that thou
   mayest teach them"; and after the Lord had thus written them the second
   time with his own finger, he delivered them to Moses, commanding him to
   provide an ark to put them into; which was not only for the safe
   keeping of them, (Deut 9:10, 10:5); but also to cover the form of the
   covenant of works that was formerly upon them, that believers might not
   perceive it; for the ark was a notable type of Christ; and therefore
   the putting of them therein did show that they were perfectly fulfilled
   in him, Christ being "the end of the law for righteousness to every one
   that believeth," (Rom 10:4). The which was yet more clearly manifest,
   in that the book of the law was placed between the cherubim, and upon
   the mercy-seat, to assure believers that the law now came to them from
   the mercy-seat; [124] for there the Lord promised to meet Moses, and to
   commune with him of all things which he would give him in commandment
   to them, (Exo 25:22).

   Ant. But, sir, was the form quite taken away, so as the ten
   commandments were no more the covenant of works?

   Evan. Oh no! you are not so to understand it. For the form of the
   covenant of works, [125] as well as the matter, [on God's part,] [126]
   came immediately from God himself, and so consequently it is eternal,
   like himself; whence it is that our Saviour says, (Matt 5:18), "Till
   heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no ways pass from
   the law, till all be fulfilled." So that either man himself, or some
   other for him, must perform or fulfill the condition of the law, as it
   is the covenant of works, or else he remains still under it in a
   damnable condition: but now Christ hath fulfilled it for all believers;
   and therefore, I said, the form of the covenant of works was covered or
   taken away, as touching the believing Jews; but yet it was neither
   taken away in itself, nor yet as touching the unbelieving Jews.

   Nom. Was the law then still of use to them, as it was the covenant of
   works?

   Evan. Yea, indeed.

   Ant. I pray you, sir, show of what use it was to them.

   Evan. I remember Luther [on the Galatians, p. 171] says, "There be two
   sorts of unrighteous persons or unbelievers: the one to be justified,
   and the other not to be justified: even so was there among the Jews."
   Now, to them that were to be justified, as you have heard, the law was
   still of use to bring them to Christ: as the apostle says, (Gal 3:24),
   "The law was our schoolmaster until Christ, [127] that we might be made
   righteous by faith"; that is to say, the moral law [128] did teach and
   show them what they should do, and so what they did not; and this made
   them go to the ceremonial law; [129] and by that they were taught that
   Christ had done it for them; [130] the which they believing, [131] were
   made righteous by faith in him. And to the second sort it was of use,
   to show them what was good, and what was evil; and to be as a bridle to
   them, to restrain them from evil, and as a motive to move them to good,
   for fear of punishment, [132] or hope of reward in this life; which,
   though it was but a forced and constrained obedience, yet was it
   necessary for the public commonwealth, the quiet thereof being thereby
   the better maintained. and though thereby they could neither escape
   death, nor yet obtain eternal life, for want of perfect obedience, yet
   the more obedience they yielded thereunto, the more they were freed
   from temporal calamities, and possessed with temporal blessings,
   according as the Lord promised and threatened, (Deut 28).

   Ant. But, sir, in that place the Lord seemeth to speak to his own
   people, and yet to speak according to the tenor of the covenant of
   works, which has made me think that believers in the Old Testament were
   partly under the covenant of works.

   Evan. Do you not remember how I told you before, that the Lord did
   manifest so much love to the body of that nation, that the whole
   posterity of Abraham [133] were brought under a state-covenant or
   national church; so that for the believers' sakes he enfolded
   unbelievers in the compact; whereupon the Lord was pleased to call them
   all by the name of his people, as well unbelievers as believers, and to
   be called their God? And though the Lord did there speak according to
   the tenor of the covenant of works, yet I see no reason why he might
   not direct and intend his speech to believers also, and yet they remain
   only under the covenant of grace.

   Ant. Why, sir, you said that the Lord did speak to them out of the
   tabernacle, and from the mercy-seat; and that, doubtless, was according
   to the tenor of the covenant of grace, and not according to the tenor
   of the covenant of works.

   Evan. I pray you take notice, that after the Lord had pronounced all
   those blessings and curses, (Deut 28 in the beginning of the 29th
   chapter), it is said, "These are the words of the covenant, which the
   Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of
   Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb." Whereby it
   doth appear to me, that this was not the covenant of works which was
   delivered to them on Mount Sinai; [134] for the form of that covenant
   was eternal blessings and curses, 28 but the form of this covenant was
   temporal blessings and curses. 29 So that this rather seems to be the
   pedagogy of the law, than the covenant of works; for at that time these
   people seemed to be carried by temporal promises into the way of
   obedience, and deterred by temporal threatenings from the ways of
   disobedience, God dealing with them as in their infancy and under age,
   and so leads them on, and allures them, and fears them, by such
   respects as these, because they had but a small measure of the Spirit.

   Nom. But, sir, was not the matter of that covenant and this all one?

   Evan. Yea, indeed; the ten commandments were the matter of both
   covenants, only they differed in the forms.

   Ant. Then, sir, it seems that the promises and threatenings contained
   in the Old Testament were but temporary and terrestrial, only
   concerning the good and evil things of this life.

   Evan. This we are to know, that like as the Lord, by his prophets, gave
   the people in the Old Testament many exhortations to be obedient to his
   commandments, and many dehortations from disobedience thereunto; even
   so did he back them with many promises and threatenings, concerning
   things temporal, as these and the like Scriptures do witness: (Isa
   1:10), "Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
   the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah": (verse 19,20), "If ye be
   willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good things of the land; but if
   ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth
   of the Lord hath spoken it." And (Jer 7:3,9,20), "Amend your ways and
   your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. Will ye
   steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely by my name?
   Therefore, thus saith the Lord God, behold mine anger and my fury shall
   be poured out upon this place." And surely there be two reasons why the
   Lord did so: first, because, as all men are born under the covenant of
   works, they are naturally prone to conceive that the favour of God, and
   all good things, do depend and follow upon their obedience to the law,
   30 and that the wrath of God, and all evil things, do depend upon and
   follow their disobedience to it, 31 and that man's chief happiness is
   to be had and found in terrestrial paradise, even in the good things of
   this life. So the people of the Old Testament being nearest to Adam's
   covenant and paradise, were most prone to such conceits. And secondly,
   because the covenant of grace and celestial paradise were but little
   mentioned in the Old Testament, they, for the most part, 32 had but a
   glimmering knowledge of them, and so could not yield obedience freely
   as sons. 33 Therefore the Lord saw it meet to move them to yield
   obedience to his laws by their own motives, 34 and as servants or
   children under age. 35

   Ant. And were both believers and unbelievers, that is, such as were
   under the covenant of grace, and such as were under the covenant of
   works, equally and alike subject, as well to have the calamities of
   this life inflicted upon them for their disobedience, as the blessings
   of this life conferred upon them for their obedience?

   Evan. Surely the words of the preacher do take place here, when he
   says, (Eccl 9:2), "All things come alike to all; there is one event to
   the righteous and to the wicked." Were not Moses and Aaron, for their
   disobedience, hindered from entering into the land of Canaan, as well
   as others? (Num 20:12). And was not Josiah, of his disobedience to
   God's command, slain in the valley of Megiddo? (2 Chron 35:21,22).
   Therefore assure yourself, that when believers in the Old Testament did
   transgress God's commandments, God's temporal wrath 36 went out against
   them, and was manifest in temporal calamities that befell them as well
   as others, (Num 16:46). Only here was the difference, the believers'
   temporal calamities had no eternal calamities included in them, nor
   following of them; 37 and the unbelievers' temporal blessings had no
   eternal blessings included in them, and their temporal calamities had
   eternal calamities included in them, and following of them. 38

   Ant. Then, sir, it seems that all obedience that any of the Jews did
   yield to God's commandments, was for fear of temporal punishment, and
   in hope of temporal reward?

   Evan. Surely the Scriptures seem to hold forth, that there were three
   several sorts of people amongst the Jews, who endeavoured to keep the
   law of God, and they did all of them differ in their ends.

   The first of them were true believers, who, according to the measures
   of their faith, did believe the resurrection of their bodies after
   death, and eternal life in glory, and that it was to be obtained, not
   by the works of the law, but by faith in the Messiah or promised seed;
   and answerably as they believed this, answerably they yielded obedience
   to the law freely, without fear of punishment or hope of reward: but,
   alas! the spirit of faith was very weak in most of them, and the spirit
   of bondage very strong, and, therefore, they stood in need to be
   induced and constrained to obedience, by fear of punishment and hope of
   reward. 39

   The second sort of them were the Sadducees and their sect, and these
   did not believe that there was any resurrection, (Matt 22:23), nor any
   life but the life of this world; and yet they endeavoured to keep the
   law, that God might bless them here, and that it might go well with
   them in this present life.

   The third sort, and indeed the greatest number of them in the future
   ages after Moses, were the Scribes and Pharisees, and their sects; and
   they held and maintained, that there was a resurrection to be looked
   for, and an eternal life after death, and, therefore, they endeavoured
   to keep the law, not only to obtain temporal happiness, but eternal
   also. For though it had pleased the Lord to make known unto his people,
   by the ministry of Moses, that the law was given, not to retain men in
   the confidence of their own works, but to drive them out of themselves,
   and to lead them to Christ the promised seed; yet after that time, the
   priests and the Levites, who were the expounders of the law, and to
   whom the Scribes and Pharisees succeeded, did so conceive and teach of
   God's intention in giving the law, as though it had been, that they, by
   their obedience to it, should obtain righteousness and eternal life;
   and this opinion was so confidently maintained, and so generally
   embraced amongst them, that in their book Mechilta, they say and
   affirm, that there is no other covenant than the law; and so, in very
   deed, they conceived that there was no other way to eternal life than
   the covenant of works.

   Ant. Surely, then, it seems they did not understand and consider that
   the law, as it is the covenant of works, does not only bind the outward
   man, but also the inward man, even the soul and spirit; and requires
   all holy thoughts, motions, and dispositions of the heart and soul?

   Evan. O, no; they neither taught it nor understood it so spiritually;
   neither could they be persuaded that the law requires so much at man's
   hands. For they first laid this down for a certain truth, that God gave
   the law for man to be justified and saved by his obedience to it; and
   that, therefore, there must needs be a power in man to do all that it
   requires, or else God would never have required it; and, therefore,
   whereas they should have first considered what a straight rule the law
   of God is, and then have brought man's heart, and have laid it to it,
   they, contrariwise, first considered what a crooked rule man's heart
   is, and then sought to make the law like it: and so indeed they
   expounded the law literally, teaching and holding, that the
   righteousness which the law required was but an external righteousness,
   consisting in the outward observation of the law, as you may see by the
   testimony of our Saviour, (Matt 5); so that, according to their
   exposition, it was possible for a man to fulfil the law perfectly, and
   so to be justified and saved by his obedience to it.

   Ant. But, sir, do you think the Scribes and Pharisees, and their sect,
   did yield perfect obedience to the law, according to their own
   exposition?

   Evan. No, indeed; I think very few of them, if any at all.

   Ant. Why, what hopes could they then have to be justified and saved,
   when they transgressed any of the commandments?

   Evan. Peter Martyr tells us, that when they chanced to transgress any
   of the ten commandments, 40 they had their sacrifices to make
   satisfaction [as they conceived]; for they looked upon their sacrifices
   without their significations, and so had a false faith in them,
   thinking that the bare work was a sacrifice acceptable unto God; in a
   word, they conceived that the blood of bulls and goats would take away
   sin, and so what they wanted of fulfilling the moral law, they thought
   to make up in the ceremonial law. And thus they separated Christ from
   their sacrifices, thinking they had discharged their duty very well,
   when they had sacrificed and offered their offerings; not considering
   that the imperfection of the typical law, which, as the apostle says,
   made nothing perfect, should have led them to find perfection in
   Christ, (Heb 7:19); but they generally rested in the work done in the
   ceremonial law,even as they had done in the moral law, though they
   themselves were unable to do the one, 41 and the other was as
   insufficient to help them. And thus "Israel, which followed the law of
   righteousness, did not attain to the law of righteousness, because they
   sought it not by faith," but, as it were, by the works of the law. For
   they being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and going about to
   establish their own righteousness, did not submit themselves to the
   righteousness of God, (Rom 9:31, 10:3).

   Ant. Then, sir, it seems there were but very few of them 42 that had a
   clear sight and knowledge of Christ?

   Evan. It is very true indeed; for generally there was such a veil of
   ignorance over their hearts, or such a veil of blindness over their
   minds, that it made their spiritual eye-sight so weak and dim, that
   they were no more able to see Christ, the Sun of righteousness, to the
   end of the law, 43 (Mal 4:2), than the weak eye of man is able to
   behold the bright sun when it shineth in its full strength. And
   therefore we read, (Exo 34:30), that when Moses's face did shine, by
   reason of the Lord's talking with him, and telling him of the glorious
   riches of his free grace in Jesus Christ, and giving unto him the ten
   commandments, written in tables of stone, as the covenant of works; 44
   to drive the people out of confidence in themselves, and their own
   legal righteousness, unto Jesus Christ and his righteousness, the
   people were not able to behold his face; that is to say, 45 by reason
   of the weakness and dimness of their spiritual eye-sight, they were not
   able to see and understand the spiritual sense of the law: namely, that
   the Lord's end or intent in giving them the law as a covenant of works,
   and as the apostle calls it, "the ministration of condemnation and
   death," (2 Cor 3:7,9), was to drive them out of themselves to Christ,
   and that then 46 it was to be abolished to them, as it was the covenant
   of works, (verse 13), and therefore Moses put the cloudy veil of
   shadowing ceremonies over his face, (Exo 34:35), that they might be the
   better able to behold it: that is to say, that they might be the better
   able to see through them, and understand, that "Christ is the end of
   the law for righteousness to every one that believeth," (Rom 9:4). For
   Moses' face, says godly Tindal, is the law rightly understood. And yet,
   alas! by reason that the priests and Levites in former times, and the
   Scribes and Pharisees in after times, "were the blind leaders of the
   blind," (Matt 15:14), the generality of them were so addicted to the
   letter of the law, [and that both moral 47 and ceremonial,] that they
   used it not as a pedagogy to Christ, but terminated their eye in the
   letter and shadow, and did not see through them to the spiritual
   substance, which is Jesus Christ, (2 Cor 3:13), especially in the
   future ages after Moses: for at the time of Christ's coming in the
   flesh, I remember but two, namely, Simeon and Anna, that desired him,
   or looked for him as a spiritual Saviour to save them from sin and
   wrath. For though all of them had in their mouths the Messiah, says
   Calvin, and the blessed state of the kingdom of David; yet they dreamed
   that this Messiah should be some great monarch that should come in
   outward pomp and power, and save and deliver them from that bondage
   which they were in under the Romans, of which bondage they were
   sensible and weary; but as for their spiritual bondage under the law,
   sin, and wrath, they were not at all sensible; and all because their
   blind guides had turned the whole law into a covenant of works, to be
   done for justification and salvation: 48 yea, and such a covenant as
   they were able to keep and fulfil, if not by the doing of the moral
   law, yet by their offering sacrifices in the ceremonial law. And for
   this cause, our Saviour, in his sermon upon the mount, took occasion to
   expound the moral law truly and spiritually, removing that false
   literal gloss which the Scribes and Pharisees had put upon it, that men
   might see how impossible it is for any mere man to fulfil it, and so
   consequently to have justification and salvation by it. And at the
   death of Christ, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top
   to the bottom, to show, says Tindal, "that the shadows of Moses' law
   should now vanish away at the flourishing light of the gospel," (Matt
   27:51). And after the death of Christ, his apostles did, both by their
   preaching and writing, labour to make men understand, that all the
   sacrifices and ceremonies were but types of Christ; and therefore he
   being now come, they were of no further use: witness that divine and
   spiritual epistle written to the Hebrews. Yet, notwithstanding, we may
   say of the Jews at this day, as the apostle did in his time, "even
   until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of
   Moses." The Lord in mercy remove it in his due time. 49

Chapter II, Section II, 6

   The natural bias towards the covenant of works.

   Ant. Well, sir, I had thought that God's covenant with the Jews had
   been a mixed covenant, and that they had been partly under the covenant
   of works; but now I perceive there was little difference betwixt their
   covenant of grace and ours.

   Evan. Truly the opposition between the Jews' covenant of grace and ours
   was chiefly of their own making. They should have been drive to Christ
   by the law: but they expected life in obedience to it, and this was
   their great error and mistake.

   Ant. And surely, sir, it is no great marvel, though they in this point
   did so much err and mistake, who had the covenant of grace made known
   to them so darkly; when many amongst us, who have it more clearly
   manifested, do the like.

   Evan. And, truly, it is no marvel, though all men naturally do so: for
   man naturally doth apprehend God to be the great Master of heaven, and
   himself to be his servant; and that therefore he must do his work
   before he can have his wages; and the more work he doth, the better
   wages he shall have. And hence it was, that when Aristotle came to
   speak of blessedness, and to pitch upon the next means to that end, he
   said, "It was operation and working"; with whom also agrees Pythagoras,
   when he says, "It is man's felicity to be like unto God, [as how?] by
   becoming righteous and holy." And let us not marvel that these men did
   so err, who never heard of Christ, nor of the covenant of grace, when
   those to whom it was made known by the apostles of Christ did the like;
   witness those to whom the apostle Paul wrote his epistles, and
   especially the Galatians: for although he had by his preaching, when he
   was present with them, made known unto them the covenant of grace; yet
   after his departure, through the seducement of false teaches, they were
   soon turned to the covenant of works, and sought to be justified,
   either in whole or in part by it; as you may see if you seriously
   consider that epistle. Nay, what says Luther? It is, says he, the
   general opinion of men's reason throughout the whole world, that
   righteousness is gotten by the works of the law; and the reason is,
   because the covenant was engendered in the minds of men in the very
   creation, [135] so that man naturally can judge no otherwise of the law
   than as of a covenant of works, which was given to make righteous, and
   to give life and salvation. This pernicious opinion of the law, that it
   justifieth and maketh righteous before God, says Luther again, "is so
   deeply rooted in man's reason, and all mankind so wrapped in it, that
   they can hardly get out; yea, I myself, says he, have now preached the
   gospel nearly twenty years, and have been exercised in the same daily,
   by reading and writing, so that I may well seem to be rid of this
   wicked opinion; yet, notwithstanding, I now and then feel this old
   filth cleave to my heart, whereby it cometh to pass that I would
   willingly have so to do with God, that I would bring something with
   myself, because of which he should give me his grace." Nay it is to be
   feared, that, as you said, many amongst us [who have more means of
   light ordinarily, than ever Luther, or any before him had, [136] yet
   notwithstanding] do either wholly, or in part, expect justification and
   acceptation by the works of the law.

   Ant. Sir, I am verily persuaded, that there be very many in the city of
   London that are carried with a blind preposterous zeal after their own
   good works and well-doings, secretly seeking to become holy, just, and
   righteous, before God, by their diligent keeping, and careful walking
   in all God's commandments; [137] and yet no man can persuade them that
   they do so: and truly, sir, I am verily persuaded that this our
   neighbour and friend, Nomista, is one of them.

   Evan. Alas! there are thousands in the world that make a Christ of
   their works; and here is their undoing, &c. They look for righteousness
   and acceptation more in the precept than in the promise, in the law
   than in the gospel, in working than in believing; and so miscarry. Many
   poor ignorant souls amongst us, when we bid them obey and do duties,
   they can think of nothing but working themselves to life; when they are
   troubled, they must lick themselves whole, when wounded, they must run
   to the salve of duties, and stream of performances, and neglect Christ.
   Nay, it is to be feared that there be divers who in words are able to
   distinguish between the law and gospel, and in their judgments hold and
   maintain, that man is justified by faith without the works of the law;
   and yet in effect and practice, that is to say, in heart and
   conscience, do otherwise. [138] And there is some touch of this in us
   all; otherwise we should not be so up and down in our comforts and
   believing as we are still, and cast down with every weakness as we are.
   [139] But what say you, neighbour Nomista, are you guilty of these
   things, think you?

   Nom. Truly, sir, I must needs confess, I begin to be somewhat jealous
   of myself that I am so; and because I desire your judgment touching my
   condition, I would entreat you to give me leave to relate it unto you.

   Evan. With great good will.

   Nom. Sir, I having been born and brought up in a country where there
   was very little preaching, the Lord knoweth I lived a great while in
   ignorance and blindness; and yet, because I did often repeat the Lord's
   prayer, the apostles' creed, and the ten commandments, and in that I
   came sometimes to divine service, as they call it, and at Easter
   received the communion, I thought my condition to be good. But at last,
   by means of hearing a zealous and godly minister in this city, not long
   after my coming hither, I was convinced that my present condition was
   not good, and therefore I went to the same minister, and told him what
   I thought of myself; so he told me that I must frequent the hearing of
   sermons, and keep the Sabbath very strictly, and leave off swearing by
   my faith and troth, and such like oaths, and beware of lying, and all
   idle words and communication; yea, and said he, you must get good books
   to read on, as Mr. Dodd on the Commandments, Mr. Bolton's Directions
   for Comfortable Walking with God, Mr. Brinsley's True Watch, and such
   like; and many similar exhortations and directions he gave me, the
   which I liked very well, and therefore endeavoured myself to follow
   them. So I fell to the hearing of the most godly, zealous, and powerful
   preachers that were in the city, and wrote their sermons after them;
   and when God gave me a family, I prayed with them, and instructed them,
   and repeated sermons to them, and spent the Lord's day in public and
   private exercises, and left off my swearing, and lying, and idle
   talking; and, according to exhortation, in few words, I did so reform
   myself and my life, that whereas before I had been only careful to
   perform the duties of the second table of the law, and that to the end
   I might gain favour and respect from civil, honest men, and to avoid
   the penalties of man's law, or temporal punishment, now I was also
   careful to perform the duties required in the first table of the law,
   and that to gain favour and respect from religious, honest men, and to
   avoid the penalty of God's law, even eternal torments in hell. Now,
   when professors of religion observed this change in me, they came to my
   house, and gave unto me the right hand of fellowship, and counted me
   one of that number: and then I invited godly ministers to my table, and
   made much of them; and then, with that same Micah mentioned in the book
   of Judges, I was persuaded the Lord would be merciful unto me, because
   I had gotten a Levite to be my priest, (Judg 17:13). In a word, I did
   now yield such an outward obedience and conformity to both tables of
   the law, that all godly ministers and religious, honest men who knew
   me, did think very well of me, counting me to be a very honest man, and
   a good Christian; and indeed I thought so of myself, especially because
   I had their approbation. And thus I went on bravely a great while, even
   until I read in Mr. Bolton's works, that the outward righteousness of
   the Scribes and Pharisees was famous in those times; for, besides their
   forbearing and protesting against gross sins, as murder, theft,
   adultery, idolatry, and the like, they were frequent and constant in
   prayer, fasting, and alms-deed, so that, without question, many of them
   were persuaded that their doing would purchase heaven and happiness.
   Whereupon I concluded, that I had as yet done no more than they; and
   withal I considered, that our Saviour says, "Except your righteousness
   exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye cannot enter
   into the kingdom of God," (Matt 5:20); yea, and I also considered that
   the apostle says, "He is not a Jew that is one outwardly; but he that
   is one inwardly, whose praise is not of men, but of God," (Rom
   2:28,29). Then did I conclude that I was not yet a true Christian; for,
   said I in my heart, I have contented myself with the praise of men, and
   so have lost all my labour and pains in performing duties; for they
   have been no better than outside performances, and, therefore, they
   must all fall down in a moment. I have not served God with all my
   heart; and, therefore, I see I must either go further, or else I shall
   never be happy. Whereupon I set about the keeping of the law in good
   earnest, and laboured to perform duties, not only outwardly, but also
   inwardly from my heart; I heard, and read, and prayed, and laboured, to
   bring my heart, and forced my soul to every duty; I called upon the
   Lord in good earnest, and told him, that whatsoever he would have me to
   do, I would do it with all my heart, if he would but save my soul. And
   then I also took notice of the inward corruptions of my heart, the
   which I had not formerly done, and was careful to govern my thoughts,
   to moderate my passions, and to suppress the motions and risings of
   lust, to banish pride and speculative wantonness, and all vain and
   sinful desires of my heart; and then I thought myself not only an
   outside Christina, but also an inside Christian, and therefore a true
   Christian indeed. And so I went on comfortably a good while, till I
   considered that the law of God requires passive obedience as well as
   active: and therefore I must be a sufferer as well as a doer, or else I
   could not be a Christian indeed; whereupon I began to be troubled at my
   impatience under God's correcting hand, and at those inward murmurings
   and discontents which I found in my spirit in time of any outward
   calamity that befell me; and then I laboured to bridle my passions, and
   to submit myself quietly to the will of God in every condition; and
   then did I also, as it were, begin to take penance upon myself, by
   abstinence, fasting, and afflicting my soul; and made pitiful
   lamentations in my prayers, which were sometimes also accompanied with
   tears, the which I was persuaded the Lord did take notice of, and would
   reward me for it; and then I was persuaded that I did keep the law, in
   yielding obedience both actively and passively. And then was I
   confident I was a true Christian, until I considered, that those Jews,
   of whom the Lord complains, (Isa 58), did as much as I; and that caused
   me to fear that all was not right with me as yet. Whereupon I went to
   another minister, and told him that though I had done thus and thus,
   and suffered thus and thus; yet was I persuaded that I was in no better
   condition than those Jews. O yes! said he; you are in a better
   condition than they: for they were hypocrites, and served not God with
   all their hearts as you do. Then I went home contentedly, and so went
   on in my wonted course of doing and suffering, and thought all was well
   with me, until I bethought myself, that before the time of my
   conversion, I had been a transgressor from the womb; yea, in the womb,
   in that I was guilty of Adam's transgression: so that I considered that
   although I kept even with God for the time present and to come, yet
   that would not free me from the guiltiness of that which was done
   before; whereupon I was much troubled and disquieted in my mind. Then I
   went to a third minister of God's holy word, and told how the case
   stood with me, and what I thought of my state and condition. He cheered
   me up, bidding me be of good comfort: for however my obedience since my
   conversion would not satisfy for my former sins; yet, inasmuch as, at
   my conversion, I had confessed, lamented, deplored, bewailed, and
   forsaken them, God, according to his rich mercy and gracious promise,
   had mercifully pardoned and forgiven them. Then I returned home to my
   house again, and went to God by earnest prayer and supplication, and
   besought him to give me assurance of the pardon and forgiveness of my
   guiltiness of Adam's sin, and all my actual transgressions before my
   conversion; and as I had endeavoured myself to be a good servant
   before, so I would still continue in doing my duty most exactly; and
   so, being assured that the Lord had granted this my request, I fell to
   my business according to my promise; I heard, I read, I prayed, I
   fasted, I mourned, I sighed, and groaned; and watched over my heart, my
   tongue, and ways, in all my doings, actions, and dealings, both with
   God and man. But after a while, I growing better acquainted with the
   spiritualness of the law, and the inward corruptions of my own heart, I
   perceived that I had deceived myself, in thinking that I had kept the
   law perfectly; for, do what I could, I found many imperfections in my
   obedience; for I had been, and was still subject to sleepiness,
   drowsiness, and heaviness, in prayers and hearing, and so in other
   duties; I failed in the manner of performance of them, and in the end
   why I performed them, seeking myself in everything I did: and my
   conscience told me I failed in my duty to God in this, in my duty to my
   neighbour in that. And then I was much troubled again: for I considered
   that the law of God requires, and is not satisfied without, an exact
   and perfect obedience. And then I went to the same minister again, and
   told him how I had purposed, promised, striven, and endeavoured, as
   much as possibly I could, to keep the law of God perfectly; and yet by
   woeful experience I had found, that I had, and did still transgress in
   many ways; and therefore I feared hell and damnation. "Oh! but," said
   he, "do not fear; for the best of Christians have their failings, and
   no man keepeth the law of God perfectly; and therefore go on, and do as
   you have done, in striving to keep the law perfectly; and in what you
   cannot do, God will accept the will for the deed; and wherein you come
   short, Christ will help you out." And this satisfied and contented me
   very much. So I returned home again, and fell to prayer, and told the
   Lord that now I saw I could not yield perfect obedience to his law, and
   yet I would not despair, because I did believe that what I could not do
   Christ had done for me: and then I did certainly conclude, that I was
   now a Christian indeed, though I was not so before: and so have I been
   persuaded ever since. And thus, sir, you see I have declared unto you,
   both how it hath been with me formerly, and how it is with me for the
   present; wherefore I would entreat you to tell me plainly and truly
   what you think of my condition. [140]

   Evan. Why, truly I must tell you, it appears to me by this relation,
   that you have gone as far in the way of the covenant of works as the
   apostle Paul did before his conversion; but yet, for aught I see, you
   have not gone the right way to the truth of the gospel; and therefore I
   question whether you be as yet truly come to Christ.

   Neoph. Good sir, give me leave to speak a few words. By the hearing of
   your discourse concerning the covenant of works, and the covenant of
   grace, I was moved to fear that I was out of the right way; but now
   having heard my neighbour Nomista make such an excellent relation, and
   yet you to question whether he truly be come to Christ or no, makes me
   conclude absolutely, that I am far from Christ. Surely, if he, upon
   whom the Lord hath bestowed such excellent gifts and graces, and who
   hath lived such a godly life as I am sure he hath done, be not right,
   then woe be unto me!

   Evan. Truly, for aught I know, you may be in Christ before him.

   Nom. But, I pray you, sir, consider, that though I am now thoroughly
   convinced, that till of late I went on in the way of the covenant of
   works; yet seeing that I at last came to see my need of Christ, and
   have verily believed that in what I come short of fulfilling the law he
   will help me out, methinks I should be truly come to Christ.

   Evan. Verily, I do conceive that this gives you no surer evidence of
   your being truly come to Christ, than some of your strict Papists have.
   For it is the doctrine of the Church of Rome, that if a man exercise
   all his power, and do his best to fulfil the law, then God, for
   Christ's sake, will pardon all his infirmities, and save his soul. And
   therefore you shall see many of your Papists very strict and zealous in
   the performance of duties, morning and evening, so many Ave Marias and
   so many Pater Nosters; yea, and many of them do great deeds of charity,
   and great works of hospitality; and all upon such grounds, and to such
   ends as these. The Papists, says Calvin, cannot abide this saying, "By
   faith alone"; for they think that their own works are in part a cause
   of their salvation; and so they make a hotch-potch and mingle-mangle,
   that is neither fish nor flesh, as men say.

   Nom. But stay, sir, I pray; you are mistaken in me; for though I hold
   that God doth accept of my doing my best to fulfil the law, yet I do
   not hold with the Papists, that my doings are meritorious; for I
   believe that God accepts not what I do, either for the work or worker's
   sake, but only for Christ's sake.

   Evan. Yet do you but still go hand in hand with the Papists; for though
   they do hold that their works are meritorious, yet they say it is by
   the merit of Christ that they become meritorious; or, as some of the
   moderate sort of them say, "Our works, sprinkled with the blood of
   Christ, become meritorious." But this you are to know, that as the
   justice of God requires a perfect obedience, so does it require that
   this perfect obedience be a personal one, viz: it must be the obedience
   of one person only; the obedience of two must not be put together, to
   make up a perfect obedience; [141] so that, if you desire to be
   justified before God, you must either bring to him a perfect
   righteousness of your own, and wholly renounce Christ; or else you must
   bring the perfect righteousness of Christ, and wholly renounce your
   own.

   Ant. But believe me, sir, I would advise him to bring Christ's and
   wholly renounce his own, as, I thank the Lord, I have done.

   Evan. You say very well; for, indeed, the covenant of grace terminates
   itself only on Christ and his righteousness; God will have none to have
   a hand in the justification and salvation of a sinner, but Christ only.
   And to say as the thing is, neighbour Nomista, Christ Jesus will either
   be a whole Saviour, or no Saviour; he will either save you alone, or
   not save you at all. (Acts 4:12), "For among men there is given no
   other name under heaven, whereby we must be saved," says the apostle
   Peter; and Jesus Christ himself says, (John 14:6), "I am the way, the
   truth, and the life; and no man cometh to the Father but by me." So
   that, as Luther truly says, "besides this way Christ, there is no way
   but wandering, no verity but hypocrisy, no life but eternal death." And
   verily, says, another godly writer, "we can neither come to God the
   Father, be reconciled unto him, nor have anything to do with him, by
   any other way or means, but only by Jesus Christ; for we shall not
   anywhere find the favour of God, true innocency, righteousness,
   satisfaction for sin, help, comfort, life, or salvation, anywhere but
   only in Jesus Christ; he is the sum and centre of all divine and
   evangelical truths: and therefore as there is no knowledge or wisdom so
   excellent, necessary, or heavenly, as the knowledge of Christ, as the
   apostle plainly gives us to understand, (1 Cor 2:2), that he
   'determined to know nothing amongst them, but only Jesus Christ and him
   crucified'; so there is nothing to be preached unto men, as an object
   of their faith, or necessary element of their salvation, which doth not
   in some way or other, either meet in Christ, or refer unto him." [142]

Chapter II, Section II, 7

   The Antinomian faith rejected.

   Ant. O, sir, you please me wondrous well in thus attributing all to
   Christ: and surely, though of late you have not been so evangelical in
   your teaching as some others in this city, which has caused me to leave
   off hearing you to hear them, yet I have formerly perceived, and now
   also perceive, that you have more knowledge of the doctrine of free
   grace than many other ministers in this city have; and to tell you the
   truth, sir, it was by your means that I was first brought to renounce
   mine own righteousness, and cleave only to the righteousness of Jesus
   Christ. [143] And thus it was: after that I had been a good while a
   legal professor, just like my friend Nomista, and heard none but your
   legal preachers, who built me up in works and doings, as they did him,
   and as their manner is; at last, a familiar acquaintance of mine, who
   had some knowledge of the doctrine of free grace, did commend you for
   an excellent preacher; and at last prevailed with me to go with him and
   hear you; and your text that day, I well remember, was Titus 3:5, "Not
   by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his
   mercy he saved us"; whence you observed, and plainly proved, that man's
   own righteousness had no hand in his justification and salvation;
   whereupon you dehorted us from putting any confidence in our own works
   and doings, and exhorted us by faith to lay hold upon the righteousness
   of Jesus Christ only; at the hearing whereof it pleased the Lord so to
   work upon me, that I plainly perceived that there was no need at all of
   my works and doings, nor anything else, but only to believe in Jesus
   Christ. [144] And indeed my heart assented to it immediately, so that I
   went home with abundance of peace and joy in believing, and gave thanks
   to the Lord for that he had set my soul at liberty from such a sore
   bondage as I had been under. And I told all my acquaintance what a
   slavish life I had lived in, being under the law; for if I did commit
   any sin, I was presently troubled and disquieted in my conscience, and
   could have no peace till I had made humble confession thereof unto God,
   craved pardon and forgiveness, and promised amendment. But now I told
   them, that whatsoever sins I committed, I was no whit troubled at them,
   nor indeed am I at this day; for I do verily believe that God, for
   Christ's sake, has freely and fully pardoned all my sins, both past,
   present, and to come; so that I am confident, that whatsoever sin or
   sins I commit, they shall never be laid to my charge, being very well
   assured, that I am so perfectly clothed with the robe of Christ's
   righteousness, that God can see no sin in me at all. And therefore now
   I can rejoice evermore in Christ, as the apostle exhorts me, and live
   merrily, though I be never so vile or sinful a creature; and indeed I
   pity them that are in the same slavish condition I was in; and would
   have them to believe as I have done, that so they may rejoice with me
   in Christ. [145] And thus, sir, you see I have declared unto you my
   condition; and therefore I entreat you to tell me what you think of me.

   Evan. There is in this city, at this day, much talk about Antinomians;
   and though I hope there be but few that do justly deserve that title,
   yet, I pray, give me leave to tell you, that I fear I may say unto you
   in this case, as it was once said unto Peter in another case, "surely
   thou art one of them, for thy speech betrayeth thee," (Matt 26:73). And
   therefore, to tell you truly, I make some question whether you have
   truly believed in Christ, for all your confidence; and indeed, I am the
   rather moved to question it, by calling to mind, that, as I have heard,
   "your conversation is not such as becometh the gospel of Christ," (Phil
   1:27).

   Ant. Why, sir, do you think it is possible for a man to have such peace
   and joy in Christ as I have had, and I thank the Lord have still, and
   not to have truly believed in Christ?

   Evan. Yes, indeed, I think it is possible; for does not our Saviour
   tell us, that those hearers, to whom he resembles the "stony
   ground,--immediately received the word with joy, and yet had no root in
   themselves," (Mark 4:16,17), and so indeed were not true believers? and
   does not the apostle give us to understand, that as there is a form of
   godliness without the power of godliness, (2 Tim 3:5), so there is a
   form of faith, without the power of faith? and therefore he prays that
   God would grant unto the Thessalonians "the work of faith with power,"
   (2 Thess 1:11). And as the same apostle gives us to understand, "there
   is a faith that is not feigned," (1 Tim 1:5), so, doubtless, there is a
   faith that is feigned. And surely when our Saviour says, (Mark
   4:26-28), "the kingdom of God is as if a man should cast seed into the
   ground, and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should
   spring up and grow, he knoweth not how, first the blade, then the ear,
   after that the full corn in the ear"; he giveth us to understand, that
   true faith is produced by the secret power of God, by little and
   little; so that sometimes a true believer himself neither knows the
   time when, nor the manner how, it was wrought. So that we may perceive,
   that true faith is not ordinarily begun, increased, and finished, all
   in a moment, as it seems yours was, but grows by degrees, according to
   that of the apostle, (Rom 1:17), "The righteousness of God is revealed
   from faith to faith," that is, from one degree of faith to another;
   from a weak faith to a strong faith, and from faith beginning to faith
   increasing towards perfection; or from faith of adherence to faith of
   evidence; but so was not yours. And again, true faith, according to the
   measure of it, produces holiness of life; but it seems yours does not
   so; and therefore, though you have had, and have still much peace and
   joy, yet that is no infallible sign that your faith is true; for a man
   may have great raptures, yea, he may have great joy, as if he were
   lifted up into the third heaven, and have a great and strong persuasion
   that his state is good, and yet be but a hypocrite for all that. And
   therefore, I beseech you, in the words of the apostle, "examine
   yourself, whether you be in the faith, prove your own self: know you
   not your own self, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be a
   reprobate?" (2 Cor 13:5).--"And if Christ is in you, the body is dead
   because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness," [146]
   (Rom 8:10).

   Ant. But, sir, if my friend Nomista went wrong in seeking to be
   justified by the works of the law, then, methinks I should have gone
   right in seeking to be justified by faith; and yet you speak as if we
   had both gone wrong.

   Evan. I remember Luther says, that in his time, if they taught in a
   sermon, that salvation consisted not in our works or life, but in the
   gift of God, some men took occasion thence to be slow to good works,
   and to live a dishonest life. And if they preached of a godly and
   honest life, others did by and by attempt to build ladders to heaven.
   [147] And moreover, he says, that in the year 1525, there were some
   fantastical spirits that stirred up the rustical people to sedition,
   saying, That the freedom of the gospel giveth liberty to all men from
   all manner of laws; and there were others that did attribute the force
   of justification to the law. Now, says he, both these sorts offend
   against the law; the one on the right hand, who would be justified by
   the law, and the other on the left hand, who would be clean delivered
   from the law. Now, I suppose, this saying of Luther's may be fitly
   applied to you two; for it appears to me, friend Antinomista, that you
   have offended on the left hand, in not walking according to the matter
   of the law; and it is evident to me, neighbour Nomista, that you have
   offended on the right hand, in seeking to be justified by your
   obedience to it. [148]

Chapter II, Section II, 8

   The evil of legalism.

   Nom. But, sir, if seeking justification by the works of the law be an
   error, yet it seems, that, by Luther's own confession, it is but an
   error on the right hand.

   Evan. But yet I tell you, it is such an error, that, by the apostle
   Paul's own confession, so far forth as any man is guilty of it, he
   makes his services his saviours, and rejects the grace of God, and
   makes the death of Christ of none effect, and perverts the Lord's
   intention, both in giving the law and in giving the gospel; and keeps
   himself under the curse of the law, and makes himself the son of a
   bond-woman, a servant, yea, and a slave, and hinders himself in the
   course of well-doing, (Gal 5:4, 3:19, 1:7, 3:10, 4:25, 5:7, 2:11); and
   in short, he goes about an impossible thing, and so loses all his
   labour.

   Nom. Why then, sir, it would seem that all my seeking to please God by
   my good works, all my strict walking according to the law, and all my
   honest course of life, has rather done me hurt than good?

   Evan. The apostle says, that "without faith it is impossible to please
   God," (Heb 11:6); that is, says Calvin, [Institut. p. 370,] "Whatsoever
   a man thinketh, purposeth, or doeth, before he be reconciled to God by
   faith in Christ, it is accursed, and not only of no value to
   righteousness, but of certain deserving to damnation." So that, says
   Luther, on Galatians, p. 63. "Whosoever goeth about to please God with
   works going before faith, goeth about to please God with sin; which is
   nothing else but to heap sin upon sin, to mock God, and to provoke him
   to wrath. Nay, [says the same Luther, on the Galatians, p. 23,] if thou
   be without Christ, thy wisdom is double foolishness, thy righteousness
   is double sin and iniquity." And, therefore, though you have walked
   very strictly according to the law, and led an honest life, yet if you
   have rested and put confidence therein, and so come short of Christ,
   then hath it indeed rather done you hurt than good. For, says a godly
   writer, a virtuous life, according to the light of nature, turneth a
   man further off from God, if he add not thereto the effectual working
   of his Spirit. And, says Luther, "they which have respect only to an
   honest life, it were better for them to be adulterers and adulteresses,
   and to wallow in the mire." [149] And surely for this cause it is that
   our Saviour tells the strict Scribes and Pharisees, who sought
   justification by works, and rejected Christ, that "publicans and
   harlots should enter into the kingdom of God before them," (Matt
   21:31). And for this cause it was that I said, For aught I know, my
   neighbour Neophytus might be in Christ before you.

   Nom. But how can that be, when, as you know, he hath confessed that he
   is ignorant and full of corruption, and comes far short of me in gifts
   and graces?

   Evan. Because, as the Pharisee had more to do before he could come at
   Christ than the publican had, so I conceive you have more to do than he
   hath.

   Nom. Why, sir, I pray you, what have I to do, or what would you advise
   me to do? for truly I would be contented to be ruled by you.

   Evan. Why, that which you have to do, before you can come to Christ, is
   to undo all that ever you have done already; that is to say, whereas
   you have endeavoured to travel toward heaven by the way of the covenant
   of works, and so have gone a wrong way; you must go quite back again
   all the way you have gone, before you can tread one step in the right
   way. And whereas you have attempted to build up the ruins of old Adam,
   and that upon yourself, and so, like a foolish builder, to build a
   tottering house upon the sands,--you must throw down and utterly
   demolish all that building, and not leave a stone upon a stone, before
   you can begin to build anew. And whereas you have conceived that there
   is some sufficiency in yourself, to help to justify and save yourself,
   you must conclude, that in that case there is not only in you an
   insufficiency, but also a non-sufficiency: [150] yea and that
   sufficiency that seemed to be in you, to be your loss. In plain terms,
   you must deny yourself, as our Saviour says, (Matt 16:24), that is,
   "you must utterly renounce all that ever you are, and all that ever you
   have done"; all your knowledge and gifts; all your hearing, reading,
   praying, fasting, weeping, and mourning; all your wandering in the way
   of works, and strict walking, must fall to the ground in a moment:
   briefly, whatsoever you have counted gain to you in the case of
   justification, you must now, with the apostle Paul, (Phil 3:7-9),
   "count loss for Christ," and judge it to be "dung, that you may win
   Christ, and be found in him, not having your own righteousness, which
   is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
   righteousness which is of God by faith."

Chapter II, Section III

   OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROMISE.

   Neo. But, sir, what would you advise me to do?

   Evan. Why, man, what aileth you?

   Neo. Why, sir, as you have been pleased to hear those two declare their
   condition unto you, so I beseech you to give me leave to do the same;
   and then you will perceive how it is with me. Sir, not long since, it
   pleased the Lord to visit me with a great fit of sickness; so, that,
   indeed, both in mine own judgment, and in the judgment of all that came
   to visit me, I was sick unto death. Whereupon I began to consider
   whither my soul was to go after its departure out of my body; and I
   thought with myself, that there were but two places, heaven and hell;
   and therefore it must needs go to one of them. Then my wicked and
   sinful life, which, indeed, I had lived, came into my mind, which
   caused me to conclude, that hell was the place provided for it; the
   which caused me to be very fearful, and to be very sorry that I had so
   lived; and I desired of the Lord to let me live a little longer, and I
   would not fail to reform my life, and amend my ways; and the Lord was
   pleased to grant me my desire. Since which time, though, indeed, it is
   true I have not lived so wickedly as formerly I had done, yet alas! I
   have come far short of that godly and religious life which I see other
   men live, and especially my neighbour Nomista; and yet you seem to
   conceive that he is not in a good condition, and therefore surely I
   must needs be in a miserable condition. Alas! sir, what do you think
   will become of me?

   Section I,

   Christ's fulfilling of the law in the room of the elect.

   Evan. I do now perceive that it is time for me to show how God, in the
   fullness of time, performed that which he purposed before all time, and
   promised in time, concerning the help and delivering of fallen mankind.
   And touching this point, The Scripture testifies, that God "did, in the
   fullness of time, send forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the
   law, to redeem them that were under the law," &c., (Gal. 4:4). That is
   to say, look how mankind by nature are under the law, as it is the
   covenant of works; so was Christ, as man's surety, contented to be; so
   that now, according to that eternal and mutual agreement that was
   betwixt God the Father and him, he put himself in the room and place of
   all the faithful, [151] (Isa 53:6), "And the Lord hath laid on him the
   iniquity of us all."

   Then came the law as it is the covenant of works, and said; "I find him
   a sinner, [152] yea, such an one as hath taken upon him the sins of all
   men, [153] therefore let him die upon the cross." Then said Christ,
   "Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared
   me; in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast no pleasure.
   Then said I, Lo, I come to do thy will, O Lord!" (Heb 10:5-7). And so
   the law proceeding in full scope against him, set upon him, and killed
   him; and, by this means, was the justice of God fully satisfied, his
   wrath appeased, and all true believers acquitted from all their sins,
   both past, present, and to come. [154] So that the law, as it is the
   covenant of works, hath not anything to say to any true believer, [155]
   for indeed they are dead to it, and it is dead to them.

   Nom. But, sir, how could the sufferings of Christ, which in respect of
   time were but finite, make full satisfaction to the justice of God,
   which is infinite?

   Evan. Though the sufferings of Christ, in respect of time, were but
   finite, yet in respect of the person that suffered, his sufferings came
   to be of infinite value; for Christ was God and man in one person, and
   therefore his sufferings were a sufficient and full ransom for man's
   soul, being of more value than the death and destruction of all
   creatures.

   Nom. But, sir, you know that the covenant of works requires man's own
   obedience or punishment, when it says, "He that doeth these things
   shall live in them"; and "Cursed is every one that continueth not in
   all things which are written in the book of the law to do them": how
   then, could believers be acquitted from their sins by the death of
   Christ?

   Evan. For answer, I pray you consider, that though the covenant of
   works requires man's own obedience or punishment, yet it nowhere
   disallows or excludes that which is done or suffered by another in his
   behalf; neither is it repugnant to the justice of God: for so there be
   a satisfaction performed by man, through a sufficient punishment for
   the disobedience of man, the law is satisfied, and the justice of God
   permitteth that the offending party be received into favour; and God
   acknowledges him, after such satisfaction made, as a just man, and no
   transgressor of the law; and though the satisfaction be made by a
   surety, yet when it is done, the principal is, by the law, acquitted.
   But yet, for the further proof and confirmation of this point, we are
   to consider, that as Jesus Christ, the second Adam, entered into the
   same covenant that the first Adam did, so by him was done whatsoever
   the first Adam had undone. So the case stands thus,--that as whatsoever
   the first Adam did, or befell him, was reckoned as done by all mankind,
   and to have befallen them, even so, whatsoever Christ did, or befell
   him, is to be reckoned as to have been done by all believers, and to
   have befallen them. So that as sin cometh from Adam alone to all
   mankind, as he in whom all have sinned; so from Jesus Christ alone
   cometh righteousness unto all that are in him, as he in whom they all
   have satisfied the justice of God; for as being in Adam, and one with
   him, all did, in him and with him, transgress the commandment of God;
   even so, in respect of faith, whereby believers are ingrafted into
   Christ, and spiritually made one with him, they did all, in him and
   with him, satisfy the justice of God in his death and sufferings. [156]
   And whosoever reckons thus reckons according to Scripture; for in
   Romans 5:12, all are said to have sinned in Adam's sin; in whom all
   have sinned, says the text, namely, in Adam, as in a public person: all
   men's acts were included in his, because their persons were included in
   his. So likewise in the same chapter it is said, "that death passed
   upon all men"; namely for this, that Adam's sin was reckoned for
   theirs. Even so, (Rom 6:10), the apostle, speaking of Christ, says, "In
   that he died, he died unto sin; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto
   God": so likewise, says he in the next verse, "Reckon ye yourselves to
   be dead unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord."
   And so, as touching the resurrection of Christ, the apostle argues, (1
   Cor 15:20), that all believers must and shall arise, because "Christ is
   risen, and is become the first fruits of them that sleep." Christ, as
   the first fruits, arises, and that in the name and stead of all
   believers; and so they rise in him and with him; for Christ did not
   rise as a private person, but he arose as a public head of the church;
   so that in his arising all believers did virtually arise. And as Christ
   at his resurrection was justified, and acquitted from all the sins of
   all believers, by God his Father, as having now fully satisfied for
   them, even so were they. [157] And thus you see the obedience of Christ
   being imputed unto believers by God for their righteousness, it puts
   them into the same estate and case, touching righteousness unto life
   before God, [158] wherein they should have been, if they had perfectly
   performed the perfect obedience of the covenant of works, "Do this and
   thou shalt live." [159]

   Chapter II, Section III, 2

   Believers dead to the law as the covenant of works.

   Nom. But, sir, are all believers dead to the law, and the law dead to
   them, say you?

   Evan. Believe it, as the law is the covenant of works, all true
   believers are dead unto it, and it is dead unto them; [160] for, they
   being incorporated into Christ, what the law or covenant of works did
   to him, it did the same to them; so that when Christ hanged on the
   cross, all believers, after a sort, hanged there with him. And
   therefore the apostle Paul having said, (Gal 2:19), "I through the law
   am dead to the law," adds in the next verse, "I am crucified with
   Christ"; which words the apostle brings as an argument to prove that he
   was dead to the law, for the law had crucified him with Christ. Upon
   which text, Luther on the Galatians, [p. 81,] says, "I likewise am
   crucified and dead to the law, forasmuch as I am crucified and dead
   with Christ." And again, "I believing in Christ, am also crucified with
   Christ." In like manner, the apostle says to the believing Romans, "So
   ye, my brethren, are dead also to the law by the body of Christ," (Rom
   7:4). Now, by the body of Christ, is meant the passion of Christ upon
   the cross, or, which is all one, the sufferings of Christ in his human
   nature. And, therefore, certainly we may conclude with godly Tindal on
   the text, that all such are dead concerning the law, as are by faith
   crucified with Christ.

   Nom. But, I pray you, sir, how do you prove that the law is dead to a
   believer?

   Evan. Why, as I conceive, the apostle affirms it, (Rom 7:1-6).

   Nom. Surely sir, you do mistake; for I remember the words of the first
   verse are, "how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he
   liveth"; and the words of the sixth verse are, "but now we are
   delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held," &c.

   Evan. I know right well, that in our last translation the words are so
   rendered; but the learned Tindal renders it thus: "Remember ye not,
   brethren, that the law hath dominion over a man as long as it
   endureth?" And Bishop Hall paraphrases upon it thus, "Know ye not,
   brethren, that the Mosaical law hath dominion over a man that is
   subject unto it, so long as the said law is in force?" So likewise
   Origen, Ambrose, and Erasmus, do all agree, that, by these words, while
   "he" or "it" liveth, we are to understand, as long as the law
   remaineth. And Peter Martyr is of opinion, that these words, while "he"
   or"it" liveth, are differently referred, either to the law, or to the
   man; for, says he, "the man is said to be dead," (verse 4), "and the
   law is said to be dead," (verse 6). Even so because the word "he" or
   "it" mentioned verse 1, signified both sexes in the Greek, Chrysostom
   thinks, that the death both of the law and the man is insinuated. And
   Theophylact, Erasmus, Bucer, and Calvin, do all understand the sixth
   verse, of the law being dead. And as the death of a believer to the law
   was accomplished by the death of Christ, even so also was the law's
   death to him; as Mr. Fox, in his sermon of Christ crucified, testifies,
   saying, "Here have we upon one cross two crucifixes, two of the most
   excellent potentates that ever were, the Son of God and the law of God,
   wrestling together about man's salvation--both cast down and both slain
   upon one cross; howbeit, not after a like sort. First, the Son of God
   was cast down, and took the fall, not for any weakness in himself, but
   was content to take it for our victory. By this fall, the law of God,
   in casting him down was caught in his own trap, and so was fast nailed
   hand and foot to the cross, according as we read in Paul's words," (Col
   2:14). And so Luther on the Galatians, [p. 184,] speaking to the same
   point, says, "This was a wonderful combat, where the law, being a
   creature, giveth such an assault to his Creator, in practising his
   whole tyranny upon the Son of God. Now, therefore, because the law did
   so horribly and cursedly sin against his God, it is accused and
   arraigned, and, as a thief and cursed murderer of the Son of God, loses
   all its right, and deserves to be condemned. The law, therefore, is
   bound, dead, and crucified to me. It is not only overcome, condemned,
   and slain unto Christ, but also to me, believing in him unto whom he
   hath freely given his victory." [161] Now then, although according to
   the apostle's intimation, (Rom 7 at the beginning,) the covenant of
   works, and man by nature, be mutually engaged to each other, so long as
   they both live; yet if, when the wife be dead the husband be free, then
   much more when he is dead also.

   Nom. But, sir, what are we to understand by this double death, or
   wherein does this freedom from the law consist?

   Evan. Death is nothing else but a dissolution, or untying of a
   compound, or a separation between matter and form; and, therefore, when
   the soul and body of man are separated, we say he is dead; so that by
   this double death, we are to understand nothing else, but that the
   bargain or covenant, which was made between God and man at first, is
   dissolved or untied; or that the matter and form of the covenant of
   works is separated to a believer. So that the law of the ten
   commandments neither promises eternal life nor threatens eternal death
   to a believer, upon condition of his obedience or disobedience to it:
   [162] and so shall you obtain forgiveness for eternal life, or fear
   eternal death upon any such terms. [163] No; we may assure ourselves,
   that "whatsoever the law saith," on any such terms, it "saith to them
   who are under the law," (Rom 3:19); but believers "are not under the
   law, but under grace," (Rom 6:14), and so have escaped eternal death,
   and obtained eternal life, only by faith in Jesus Christ; [164] "for by
   him all that believe are justified from all things, from which they
   could not be justified by the law of Moses," (Acts 13:39)--"For God so
   loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever
   believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life," (John
   3:16).

   And this is that covenant of grace, which, as I told you, was made with
   the fathers by way of promise, and so but darkly; but now the fullness
   of time being come, it was more fully opened and promulgated.

   Ant. Well, sir, you have made it evident and plain, that Christ hath
   delivered all believers from the law, as it is the covenant of works;
   and that therefore they have nothing at all to do with it.

   Evan. No, indeed; none of Christ's are to have anything to do with the
   covenant of works, but Christ only. For although in the making of the
   covenant of works at first, God was one party, and man another, yet, in
   making it the second time, God was on both sides:--God, simply
   considered in his essence, was the party opposed to man; and God, the
   second person, having taken upon him to be incarnate, and to work man's
   redemption, was on man's side, and takes part with man, that he may
   reconcile him to God, by bearing man's sins, and satisfying God's
   justice for them. And Christ paid God [165] till he said he had enough;
   he was fully satisfied, fully contented, (Matt 3:17), "This is my
   beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Yea, God the Father was well
   pleased, and fully satisfied from all eternity, by virtue of that
   covenant that was made betwixt them. And thereupon all Christ's people
   were given to him in their election. (Eph 1:4) "Thine they were," [166]
   says Christ, "and thou gavest them me," (John 17:6).

   And again, says he, "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all
   things into his hands," (John 3:35); that is, he hath entrusted him
   with the economic and actual administration of that power in the
   Church, which originally belonged unto himself. And hence it is that
   Christ also says, "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all
   judgment unto the Son," (John 5:22) So that all the covenant that
   believers are to have regard to, for life and salvation, is the free
   and gracious covenant that is betwixt Christ [or God in Christ] and
   them. [167] And in this covenant there is not any condition or law to
   be performed on man's part, by himself; [168] no, there is no more for
   him to do, but only to know and believe that Christ hath done all for
   him. [169] Wherefore my dear Neophytus, to turn my speech particularly
   to you, [because I see you are in heaviness,] I beseech you to be
   persuaded that here you are to work nothing, here you are to do
   nothing, here you are to render nothing unto God, but only to receive
   the treasure, which is Jesus Christ, and apprehend him in your heart by
   faith, although you be never so great a sinner; [170] and so shall you
   obtain forgiveness of sins, righteousness, and eternal happiness; not
   as an agent but as a patient, not by doing, but by receiving. [171]
   Nothing here comes betwixt but faith only, apprehending Christ in the
   promise. [172] this, then, is perfect righteousness, to hear nothing,
   to know nothing, to do nothing of the law of works; but only to know
   and believe that Jesus Christ is now gone to the Father, and sitteth at
   his right hand, not as a judge, but is made unto you of God, wisdom,
   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. [173] Wherefore, as Paul
   and Silas said to the jailer, so say I unto you, "Believe on the Lord
   Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved"; that is, be verily persuaded in
   your heart that Jesus Christ is yours, and that you shall have life and
   salvation by him; that whatsoever Christ did for the redemption of
   mankind, he did it for you. [174]

Chapter II, Section III, 3

   The warrant to believe in Christ.

   Neo. But, sir, hath such a one as I any warrant to believe in Christ?

   Evan. I beseech you consider, that God the Father, as he is in his Son
   Jesus Christ, moved with nothing but with his free love to mankind
   lost, hath made a deed of gift and grant unto them all, that whosoever
   of them all shall believe in this his Son, shall not perish, but have
   eternal life. [175] And hence it was, that Jesus Christ himself said
   unto his disciples, (Mark 16:15), "Go and preach the gospel to every
   creature under heaven": [176] that is, Go and tell every man without
   exception, that here is good news for him; Christ is dead for him; and
   if he will take him, and accept of his righteousness, he shall have
   him. [177] Therefore, says a godly writer, "Forasmuch as the holy
   Scripture speaketh to all in general, none of us ought to distrust
   himself, but believe that it doth belong particularly to himself."
   [178] And to the end, that this point, wherein lies and consists the
   whole mystery of our holy faith, may be understood the better, let us
   put the case, that some good and holy king should cause a proclamation
   to be made through his whole kingdom, by the sound of a trumpet, that
   all rebels and banished men shall safely return home to their houses:
   because that, at the suit and desert of some dear friend of theirs, it
   has pleased the king to pardon them; certainly, none of these rebels
   ought to doubt, but that he shall obtain true pardon for his rebellion;
   and so return home, and live under the shadow of that gracious king.
   Even so, our good King, the Lord of heaven and earth, has, for the
   obedience and desert of our good brother Jesus Christ, pardoned all our
   sins, [179] and made a proclamation throughout the whole world, [180]
   that every one of us may safely return to God in Jesus Christ:
   wherefore I beseech you make no doubt of it, but "draw near with a true
   heart in full assurance of faith," (Heb 10:22). [181]

   Neo. Oh, but, sir, in this similitude the case is not alike. For when
   the earthly king sends forth such a proclamation, it may be thought
   that he indeed intends to pardon all; but it cannot be thought that the
   King of heaven does so: for do not the Scriptures say, that "some men
   are ordained before to condemnation"? (Jude 4) And does not Christ
   himself say, that "many are called, but few are chosen"? (Matt 22:14)
   and, therefore, it may be, I am one of them that are ordained to
   condemnation; and, therefore, though I be called, I shall never be
   chosen, and so shall not be saved.

   Evan. I beseech you to consider, that although some men be ordained to
   condemnation, yet so long as the Lord has concealed their names, and
   not set a mark of reprobation upon any man in particular, but offers
   the pardon generally to all, without having any respect either to
   election or reprobation, surely it is great folly in any man to say, It
   may be I am not elected, and therefore shall not have benefit by it;
   and therefore I will not accept of it, nor come in: [182] for it should
   rather move every man to give diligence "to make his calling and
   election sure," (2 Peter 1:10), by believing it, for fear we come short
   of it, [183] according to that of the apostle, "let us, therefore,
   fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of us
   should seem to come short of it," (Heb 4:1). Wherefore, I beseech you,
   do not you say, It may be I am not elected, and therefore I will not
   believe in Christ; but rather say, I do believe in Christ, and
   therefore I am sure I am elected. [184] And check your own heart for
   meddling with God's secrets, and prying into his hidden counsel, and go
   no more beyond your bounds, as you have done, in this point: for
   election and reprobation is a secret; and the Scripture tells us, "that
   secret things belong unto God, but those things that are revealed
   belong unto us," (Deut 29:29). Now this is God's revealed will, for,
   indeed, it is his express command, "That you should believe on the name
   of his Son," (1 John 3:23); and it is his promise, "that if you
   believe, you shall not perish, but have everlasting life," (John 3:16).
   Wherefore, you having so good a warrant as God's command, and so great
   an encouragement as his promise, do your duty; [185] and by the doing
   thereof you may put it [186] out of question, and be sure that you are
   also one of God's elect. Say, then, I beseech you, with a firm faith,
   The righteousness of Jesus Christ belongs to all that believe, but I
   believe, [187] and therefore it belongs to me. Yea, say with Paul, "I
   live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me, and gave himself for
   me," (Gal 2:20). "He saw in me [says Luther on the text] nothing but
   wickedness, going astray, and fleeing from him. Yet this good Lord had
   mercy on me, and of his mere mercy he loved me, yea, so loved me, that
   he gave himself for me. Who is this me? Even I, wretched and damnable
   sinner, was so dearly beloved of the Son of God that he gave himself
   for me."

   Oh! print this word "me" in your heart, and apply it to your own self,
   not doubting but that you are one of those to whom this "me" belongs.
   [188]

   Neo. But may such a vile and sinful wretch as I am be persuaded that
   God commands me to believe, and that he hath made a promise to me?
   [189]

   Evan. Why do you make a question, where there is none to be made? "Go,"
   says Christ, "and preach the gospel to every creature under heaven,"
   that is, Go tell every man without exception, whatsoever his sins be,
   whatsoever his rebellions be, go and tell him these glad tidings, that
   if he will come in, I will accept of him, his sins shall be forgiven
   him, and he shall be saved; if he will come in and take me, and receive
   me, I will be his loving husband, and he shall be mine own dear spouse.
   Let me, therefore, say unto you, in the words of the apostle, "Now,
   then, I as an ambassador for Christ, as though God did beseech you by
   me, I pray you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled unto God; for he
   hath made him to be sin for you, who knew no sin, that ye might be made
   the righteousness of God in him," (2 Cor 5:20,21).

   Neo. But do you say, sir, that if I believe I shall be espoused unto
   Christ?

   Evan. Yea, indeed, shall you: for faith coupleth the soul with Christ,
   even as the spouse with her husband; by which means Christ and the soul
   are made one: for as, in corporal marriage, man and wife are made one
   flesh, even so in this spiritual and mystical marriage, Christ and his
   spouse are made one spirit. And this marriage, of all others, is most
   perfect, and absolutely accomplished between them; for the marriage
   between man and wife is but a slender figure of this union; wherefore,
   I beseech you to believe it, and then you shall be sure to enjoy it.
   [190]

   Neo. But, sir, if David said, "Seemeth it to you a light thing to be an
   earthly king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and lightly
   esteemed"? (1 Sam 18:23); then surely I have much more cause to say,
   Seemeth it a light thing to be a heavenly King's daughter-in- law,
   seeing that I am such a poor sinful wretch? Surely, sir, I cannot be
   persuaded to believe it.

   Evan. Alas! man, how much are you mistaken! for you look upon God, and
   upon yourself, with the eye of reason; and so as standing in relation
   to each other, according to the tenor of the covenant of works:
   whereas, you being now in the case of justification and reconciliation,
   you are to look both upon God and upon yourself with the eye of faith;
   and so standing in relation to each other, according to the tenor of
   the covenant of grace. For, says the apostle, "God was in Christ,
   reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their sins unto them,"
   (2 Cor 5:19); as if he had said, Because as God stands in relation to
   man, according to the tenor of the covenant of works, and so out of
   Christ, he could not, without prejudice to his justice, be reconciled
   unto them, nor have any thing to do with them, otherwise than in wrath
   and indignation; therefore to the intent that Justice and Mercy might
   meet together, and Righteousness and Peace might embrace each other,
   and so God stand in relation to man, according to the tenor of the
   covenant of grace; he put himself into his Son Jesus Christ, and
   shrouded himself there, that so he might speak peace to his people,
   (Psa 85:8-10). Sweetly, says Luther, "Because the nature of God was
   otherwise higher than that we are able to attain unto it, therefore
   hath he humbled himself for us, and taken our nature upon him, and so
   put himself into Christ. Here he looketh for us, here he will receive
   us; and he that seeketh him here shall find him." [191] "This," says
   God the Father, "is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased," (Matt
   3:17); whereupon the same Luther says in another place, "We must not
   think and persuade ourselves that this voice came from heaven for
   Christ's own sake, but for our sakes, even as Christ himself says,
   (John 12:30), 'This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.'
   The truth is, Christ had no need that it should be said unto him, 'This
   is my beloved Son,' he knew that from all eternity, and that he should
   still so remain, though these words had not been spoken from heaven;
   therefore, by these words, God the Father, in Christ his Son, cheers
   the hearts of poor sinners, and greatly delights them with singular
   comfort and heavenly sweetness, assuring them, that whosoever is
   married unto Christ, and so in him by faith, he is as acceptable to God
   the Father as Christ himself; [192] according to that of the apostle,
   'He hath made us acceptable in his beloved,' (Eph 1:6). Wherefore, if
   you would be acceptable to God, and be made his dear child, then by
   faith cleave unto his beloved Son Christ, and hang about his neck, yea,
   and creep into his bosom; and so shall the love and favour of God be as
   deeply insinuated into you as it is into Christ himself; and so shall
   God the Father, together with his beloved Son, wholly possess you, and
   be possessed of you; and so God, and Christ, and you, shall become one
   entire thing, according to Christ's prayer, 'that they may be one in
   us, as thou and I are one,' (John 17:21)." [193] And by this means you
   may have sufficient ground and warrant to say, [in the matter of
   reconciliation with God at any time, whensoever you are disputing with
   yourself, how God is to be found, that justifies and saves sinners,] I
   know no other God, neither will I know any other God, besides this God,
   that came down from heaven, and clothed himself with my flesh, [194]
   unto "whom all power is given, both in heaven and in earth," who is my
   judge; "for the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
   to the Son," (John 5:22). So that Christ may do with me whatsoever he
   liketh, and determine of me according to his own mind; and I am sure he
   hath said, "he came not to judge the world but to save the world,"
   (John 12:47). And therefore I do believe that he will save me. [195]

   Neo. Indeed, sir, if I were so holy and so righteous as some men are,
   and had such power over my sins and corruptions as some men have, then
   I could easily believe it; but, alas! I am so sinful and so unworthy a
   wretch, that I dare not presume to believe that Christ will accept of
   me, so as to justify and save me.

   Evan. Alas! man, in thus saying, you seem to contradict and gainsay
   both the apostle Paul, and our Lord Jesus Christ himself; and that
   against your own soul: for whereas the apostle Paul says, "that Christ
   Jesus came into the world to save sinners," (1 Tim 1:15), and doth
   justify the ungodly, (Rom 4:5), why, you seem to hold, and do in effect
   say, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save the righteous, and
   to justify the godly. And whereas our Saviour says, the whole need not
   a physician, but the sick; and that he came not to call the righteous
   but sinners to repentance, (Matt 9:12); why, you seem to hold, and do
   in effect say, that the sick need not a physician, but the whole: and
   that he came, not to call sinners, but the righteous to repentance. And
   indeed, in so saying, you seem to conceive, that Christ's spouse must
   be purified, washed, and cleansed from all her filthiness, and adorned
   with a rich robe of righteousness, before he will accept of her;
   whereas he himself said unto her, (Eze 16:4-8), "As for thy nativity,
   in the day that thou wast born, thy navel was not cut, neither wast
   thou washed with water to supple thee; thou wast not swaddled at all,
   nor salted at all. No eye pitied thee to do any of these things unto
   thee; but when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time
   was a time of love. And I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy
   nakedness; yea, and I sware unto thee, and entered into covenant with
   thee, and thou becamest mine."--(Hosea 2:19), "And I will marry thee
   unto me for ever; yea, I will marry thee unto me in righteousness, and
   in judgment, and in mercy, and compassion."

   Wherefore, I beseech you, revoke this your erroneous opinion, and
   contradict the word of truth no longer; but conclude for a certainty,
   that it is not the righteous and godly man, but the sinful and ungodly
   man, [196] that Christ came to call, justify, and save: so that if you
   were a righteous and godly man, you were neither capable of calling,
   justifying, or saving by Christ; but being a sinful and ungodly man, I
   will be bold to say unto you as the people said unto blind Bartimeus,
   (Mark 10:49), "Be of good comfort; arise, he calleth thee," and will
   justify and save thee. [197] Go then unto him, I beseech you; and if he
   come and meet thee, [as his manner is,] then do not you unadvisedly
   say, with Peter, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!" (Luke
   5:8); but say, in plain terms, O come unto me; for I am a sinful man, O
   Lord! Yea, go on further, and say, as Luther bids you, Most gracious
   Jesus and sweet Christ, I am a miserable, poor sinner, and, therefore,
   do judge myself unworthy of thy grace; but yet I, having learned from
   thy word that thy salvation belongs unto such a one, therefore do I
   come unto thee, to claim that right which, through thy gracious
   promise, belongs unto me. Assure yourself, man, that Jesus Christ
   requires no portion with his spouse; no, verily, he requires nothing
   with her but mere poverty: "the rich he sends empty away," (Luke 1:53);
   but the poor are by him enriched. And, indeed, says Luther, "the more
   miserable, sinful, and distressed a man doth feel himself, and judge
   himself to be, the more willing is Christ to receive him and relieve
   him." So that, says he, in judging thyself unworthy, thou dost thereby
   become truly worthy; and so, indeed, hast gotten a greater occasion of
   coming to him. Wherefore, then, in the words of the apostle, I do
   exhort and beseech you to "come boldly unto the throne of grace, that
   you may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need," (Heb
   4:16).

   Neo. But, truly, sir, my heart, as it were, trembles within me, to
   think of coming to Christ, after such a bold manner; and surely, sir,
   if I should so come unto him, it would argue much pride and presumption
   in me.

   Evan. Indeed, if you should be encouraged to come unto Christ and to
   speak thus unto him, because of any godliness, righteousness, or
   worthiness, that you conceive to be in you; that, I confess, were proud
   presumption in you. But to come to Christ, by believing that he will
   accept of you, justify, and save you freely by his grace, according to
   his gracious promise, this is neither pride nor presumption: [198] for
   Christ having tendered and offered it to you freely, believe it, it is
   true humility of heart to take what Christ offers you.

   Nom. But, by your favour, sir, I pray you give me leave to speak a word
   by the way. I know my neighbour, Neophytus, it may be, better than you
   do; yet I do not intend to charge him with any sin, otherwise than by
   way of supposition: as thus, suppose he has been guilty of the
   committing of gross and grievous sins, will Christ accept of him, and
   justify and save him for all that?

   Evan. Yes, indeed; for there is no limitation of God's grace in Jesus
   Christ, except the sin against the Holy Ghost. [199] Christ "stands at
   the door and knocks," (Rev 3:20). And if any murdering Manasseh, or any
   persecuting and blaspheming Saul, (1 Tim 1:13), or any adulterous Mary
   Magdalene, "will open unto him, he will come in," and bring comfort
   with him, "and will sup with him." "Seek from the one end of the
   heavens to the other," says Hooker; "turn all the Bible over, and see
   if the words of Christ be not true, 'Him that cometh unto me, I will in
   no ways cast out,'" (John 6:37).

   Nom. Why, then, sir, it seems you hold, that the vilest sinner in the
   world ought not to be discouraged from coming unto Christ, and
   believing in him, by reason of his sins.

   Evan. Surely, if "Christ came into the world to seek, and call, and
   save sinners, and to justify the ungodly," as you have heard; and if
   the more sinful, miserable, and distressed a man judge himself to be,
   the more willing Christ is to receive him and relieve him; then I see
   no reason why the vilest sinner should be discouraged from believing on
   the name of Jesus Christ by reason of his sins. Nay, let me say more;
   the greater any man's sins are, either in number or nature, the more
   haste he should make to come unto Christ, and to say with David, "For
   thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity, for it is great!" (Psa
   25:11).

   Ant. Surely, sir, if my friend Neophytus did rightly consider these
   things, and were assuredly persuaded of the truth of them, methinks he
   should not be so backward from coming to Christ, by believing on his
   name, as he is; for if the greatness of his sin should be so far from
   hindering his coming to Christ, that they should further his coming,
   then I know not what should hinder him.

   Evan. You speak very truly indeed. And therefore I beseech you,
   neighbour Neophytus, consider seriously of it; and neither let your own
   accusing conscience, nor Satan the accuser of the brethren, hinder you
   any longer from Christ. For what though they should accuse you of
   pride, infidelity, covetousness, lust, anger, envy, and hypocrisy? yea,
   what though they should accuse you of whoredom, theft, drunkenness, and
   such like? yea, do what they can, they can make no worse a man of you
   than a sinner, or chief of sinners, or an ungodly person; and so,
   consequently, such an one Christ came to justify and save; so that in
   very deed, if you do rightly consider of it, they do you more good than
   hurt by their accusations. [200] And therefore, I beseech you, in all
   such cases or conflicts, take the counsel of Luther, who, on the
   Galatians, [p. 20,] says, "When thy conscience is thoroughly afraid
   with the remembrance of thy sins past, and the devil assaileth thee
   with great violence, going about to overwhelm thee with heaps, floods,
   and whole seas of sins, to terrify thee, and to draw thee from Christ;
   then arm thyself with such sentences as these: Christ the Son of God
   was given, not for the holy, righteous, worthy, and such as were his
   friends; but for the wicked sinners, for the unworthy, and for his
   enemies. Wherefore, if the devil say, Thou art a sinner, and therefore
   must be damned; then answer thou, and say, Because thou sayest I am a
   sinner, therefore will I be righteous and saved. And if he reply, Nay,
   sinners must be damned; then answer thou, and say, No, for I flee to
   Christ, who hath given himself for my sins; and, therefore, Satan, in
   that thou sayest I am a sinner, thou givest me armour and weapons
   against thyself, that with thine own sword I may cut thy throat, and
   tread thee under my feet." [201] And thus you see it is the counsel of
   Luther, that your sins should rather drive you to Christ than keep you
   from him.

   Nom. But, sir, suppose he hath not as yet truly repented for his many
   and great sins, hath he any warrant to come unto Christ, by believing,
   till he has done so?

   Evan. I tell you truly, that whatsoever a man is, or whatsoever he hath
   done or not done, he hath warrant enough to come unto Christ by
   believing, if he can; [202] for Christ makes a general proclamation,
   saying, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he
   that hath no money, come, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk
   without money, and without price." This, you see, is the condition,
   "buy wine and milk," that is, grace and salvation, "without money,"
   that is, without any sufficiency of your own; [203] only "incline your
   ear and hear, and your souls shall live"; yea, live by hearing that
   "Christ will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure
   mercies of David."

Chapter II, Section III, 4

   Evangelical repentance a consequent of faith.

   Nom. But yet, sir, you see that Christ requires a thirsting, before a
   man come unto him, the which, I conceive, cannot be without true
   repentance.

   Evan. In the last chapter of the Revelation, verse 17, Christ makes the
   same general proclamation, saying, "Let him that is athirst come"; and
   as if the Holy Ghost had so long since answered the same objection that
   yours is, it follows in the next words, "And whosoever will, let him
   take of the water of life freely," even without thirsting, if he will;
   for "him that cometh unto me, I will in nowise cast out," [204] (John
   6:37). But because it seems you conceive he ought to repent before he
   believe, I pray tell me what you do conceive repentance to be, or
   wherein does it consist?

   Nom. Why, I conceive that repentance consists in a man's humbling
   himself before God, and sorrowing and grieving for offending him by his
   sins, and in turning from them all to the Lord.

   Evan. And would you have a man to do all this truly [205] before he
   come to Christ by believing?

   Nom. Yea, indeed, I think it is very meet he should.

   Evan. Why, then, I tell you truly, you would have him to do that which
   is impossible. [206]

   For, first of all godly humiliation, in true penitents, proceeds from
   the love of God their good Father, and so from the hatred of that sin
   which has displeased him; and this cannot be without faith. [207]

   Secondly. Sorrow and grief for displeasing God by sin, necessarily
   argue the love of God; and it is impossible we should ever love God,
   till by faith we know ourselves loved of God. [208]

   Thirdly. No man can turn to God, except he be first turned of God: and
   after he is turned, he repents; so Ephraim says, "After I was
   converted, I repented," [209] (Jer 31:19). The truth is, a repentant
   sinner first believes that God will do that which he promiseth, namely,
   pardon his sin, and take away his iniquity; then he rests in the hope
   of it; and from that, and for it, he leaves sin, and will forsake his
   old course, [210] because it is displeasing to God; and will do that
   which is pleasing and acceptable to him. [211] So that, first of all,
   God's favour is apprehended, and remission of sins believed; [212] then
   upon that cometh alteration of life and conversation. [213]

   Nom. But, sir, as I conceive, the Scripture holds forth, that the Lord
   has appointed repentance to go before faith; for, is it not said, (Mark
   1:15), "Repent and believe the gospel"?

   Evan. To the intent that you may have a true and satisfactory answer to
   this your objection, I would pray you to consider two things:

   First. That the word "repent" in the original, signifies a change of
   our minds from false ways, to the right, and of our hearts from evil to
   good: [214] and as that son in the gospel said, "He would not go" work
   in his father's vineyard: yet afterwards says the text, "he repented
   and went," (Matt 21:29): that is, he changed his mind and went.

   Secondly. That in those days, when John the Baptist and our Saviour
   preached, their hearers were most of them erroneous in their minds and
   judgments; for they being leavened with the doctrine of the Pharisees
   and Sadducees, of which our Saviour bade his disciples take heed and
   beware, (Matt 16:6,12), the most of them were of opinion, that the
   Messiah whom they looked for should be some great and mighty monarch,
   who should deliver them from their temporal bondage, as I showed
   before. And many of them were of the opinion of the Pharisees, who
   held, that as an outward conformity to the letter of the law was
   sufficient to gain favour and estimation from men, so it was sufficient
   for their justification and acceptation before God, and so,
   consequently, to bring them to heaven and eternal happiness; and,
   therefore, for these ends, they were very diligent in fasting and
   prayer, (Luke 18:12-14), and very careful to pay tithes of mint, anise,
   and cummin, and yet did omit the weightier matters of the law, as
   judgment, mercy, faith, and the love of God, (Matt 23:23, Luke 11:42).
   And so, as our Saviour told them, (Matt 23:25), "they made clean the
   outside of the cup, and of the platter, but within they were full of
   extortion and excess."

   And divers of them were of the opinion of the Sadducees, (Acts 23:8),
   who held "that there was no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit";
   and so had all their hopes and comfort in the things of this life, not
   believing any other.

   Now our Saviour, preaching to these people, said, "The time is
   fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye and believe the
   gospel." As if he had said, The time set by the prophets for the
   manifestation of the Messiah is fully come; and his kingdom, which is a
   spiritual and heavenly kingdom, is at hand; therefore change your minds
   from false ways to right, and your hearts from evil to good; [215] and
   do not any longer imagine, that the Messiah you look for, shall be one
   that shall save and deliver you from your temporal enemies; but from
   your spiritual, that is, from your sins, and from the wrath of God, and
   from eternal damnation; and therefore put your confidence no longer in
   your own righteousness, though you walk never so exactly according to
   the letter of the law; but believe the glad tidings that are now
   brought to you, namely, that the Messiah shall save you from sin,
   wrath, the devil, and hell, and bring you to eternal life and glory.
   Neither let any of you any longer imagine, that there is to be no
   resurrection of the dead, and so have your hopes only in this life: but
   believe these glad tidings, that are now brought unto you, concerning
   the Messiah; and he shall raise you up at the last day, and give you an
   eternal life. Now, with submission to better judgments, I do conceive,
   that if there be in the book of God any repentance exhorted unto,
   before faith in Christ; or if any repentance go, either in order of
   nature or time, before faith in Christ, it is only such a like
   repentance as this. [216]

   Nom. But, sir, do you think that there is such a like repentance, that
   goes before faith in Christ, in men now-a-days?

   Evan. Yea, indeed, I think there is. As, for example, when a profane
   sensual man [who lives as though, with the Sadducees, he did not
   believe any resurrection of the dead, neither hell nor heaven] is
   convinced in his conscience, that if he go on in making a god of his
   belly, and in minding only earthly things, his end shall be damnation;
   sometimes such a man thereupon changes his mind, and of a profane man,
   becomes a strict Pharisee, or [as some call him] a legal professor; but
   being convinced, that all his own righteousness will avail him nothing,
   in the case of justification, and that it is only the righteousness of
   Jesus Christ that is available in that case, then he changes his mind,
   and, with the apostle, "desires to be found in Christ, not having his
   own righteousness which is of the law, but that which is through the
   faith of Christ, even the righteousness which is of God through faith,"
   (Phil 3:9). Now I conceive, that a man that does this, changes his mind
   from false ways to the right way, and his heart from evil to good; and
   so, consequently, doth truly repent. [217]

   Nom. But, sir, do not you hold, that although repentance, according to
   my definition, goes not before faith in Christ, yet it follows after?

   Evan. Yes, indeed; I hold, that although it go not before as an
   antecedent of faith, yet it follows as a consequent. For when a man
   believes the love of God to him in Christ, then he loves God because he
   loved him first; and that love constrains him to humble himself at the
   Lord's footstool, and to acknowledge himself to be less than the least
   of all his mercies; yea, and then will he "remember his own evil ways
   and doings, that were not good, and will loathe himself in his own
   sight for his iniquities, and for his abominations," (Eze 36:31); yea,
   and then will he also cleanse himself from all filthiness of flesh and
   spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God, having respect unto all
   God's commandments, (2 Cor 7:1, Psa 119:6).

   Nom. Well, sir, I am answered.

Chapter II, Section III, 5

   The spiritual marriage with Jesus Christ.

   Neo. And truly, sir you have so declared and set forth Christ's
   disposition towards poor sinners, and so answered all my doubts and
   objections, that I am now verily persuaded that Christ is willing to
   entertain me; and surely I am willing to come unto him, and receive
   him; but, alas! I want power.

   Evan. But tell me truly, are you resolved to put forth all your power
   to believe, and so to take Christ? [218]

   Neo. Truly, sir, methinks my resolution is much like the resolution of
   the four lepers, who sat at the gate of Samaria; for as they said, "If
   we enter into the city, the famine is in the city, and we shall die
   there; and if we sit still here, we die also; now, therefore, let us
   fall unto the host of the Syrians; if they save us, we shall live, and
   if they kill us, we shall but die," (2 Kings 7:4); even so say I in
   mine heart, If I go back to the covenant of works to seek justification
   thereby, I shall die there; and if I sit still and seek it no way, I
   shall die also; now, therefore, though I be somewhat fearful, yet am I
   resolved to go unto Christ; and if I perish, I perish. [219]

   Evan. Why, now I tell you the match is made; Christ is yours, [220] and
   you are his, "this day is salvation come to your house," [your soul I
   mean:] for, what though you have not that power to come so fast to
   Christ, and lay such firm hold on him, as you desire; yet coming with
   such a resolution to take Christ, as you do, you need not care for
   power to do it, inasmuch as Christ will enable you to do it; [221] for
   is it not said, (John 1:12), "But as many as received him, to them gave
   he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
   name?" [222] O therefore, I beseech you, stand no longer disputing; but
   be peremptory and resolute in your faith, and in casting yourself upon
   God in Christ for mercy; and let the issue be what it will. Yet let me
   tell you, to your comfort, that such a resolution shall never go to
   hell. Nay, I will say more; if any soul have room in heaven, such a
   soul shall; for God cannot find in his heart to damn such a one. I
   might, then, with as much true confidence say unto you, as John
   Careless said to John Bradford, in a letter to him, "Hearken, O
   heavens, and thou O earth, give ear, and bear me witness, at the great
   day, that I do here faithfully and truly declare the Lord's message
   unto his dear servant and singularly beloved John Bradford, saying,
   'John Bradford, thou man so specially beloved of God, I do pronounce
   and testify unto thee, in the word and name of the Lord Jehovah, that
   all thy sins whatsoever they be, though never so many, grievous, or
   great, be fully and freely pardoned, released, and forgiven thee, by
   the mercy of God in Jesus Christ, the only Lord and sweet Saviour, in
   whom thou dost undoubtedly believe; as truly as the Lord liveth, he
   will not have thee die the death; but hath verily purposed, determined,
   and decreed, that thou shalt live with him for ever.'"

   Neo. O, sir, if I have as good warrant to apply this saying to myself
   as Mr. Bradford had to himself, then I am a happy man!

   Evan. I tell you from Christ, and under the hand of the Spirit, that
   your person is accepted, your sins are done away, and you shall be
   saved; and if an angel from heaven should tell you otherwise, let him
   be accursed. Therefore, you may [without doubt] conclude that you are a
   happy man; for by means of this your matching with Christ, you are
   become one with him, and one in him, you "dwell in him, and he in you,"
   (1 John 4:13). He is "your well beloved, and you are his," (Cant 2:16).
   So that the marriage union betwixt Christ and you is more than a bare
   notion or apprehension of your mind; for it is a special, spiritual,
   and real union: it is an union betwixt the nature of Christ, God and
   man, and you; [223] it is a knitting and closing, not only of your
   apprehension with a Saviour, but also of your soul with a Saviour.
   Whence it must needs follow that you cannot be condemned, except Christ
   be condemned with you; neither can Christ be saved, except you be saved
   with him. [224] And as by means of corporeal marriage all things become
   common betwixt man and wife; even so, by means of this spiritual
   marriage, all things become common betwixt Christ and you; for when
   Christ hath married his spouse unto himself, he passeth over all his
   estate unto her; so that whatsoever Christ is or hath, you may boldly
   challenge as your own. "He is made unto you, of God, wisdom,
   righteousness, sanctification, and redemption," (1 Cor 1:30). And
   surely, by virtue of this near union it is, that as Christ is called
   "the Lord our righteousness," (Jer 33:6), even so is the church called,
   "the Lord our righteousness," (verse 16). I tell you, you may, by
   virtue of this union, boldly take upon yourself, as your own, Christ's
   watching, abstinence, travails, prayers, persecutions, and slanders;
   yea, his tears, his sweat, his blood, and all that ever he did and
   suffered in the space of three and thirty years, with his passion,
   death, burial, resurrection, and ascension; for they are all yours. And
   as Christ passes over all his estate unto his spouse, so does he
   require that she should pass over all unto him. Wherefore, you being
   now married unto Christ, you must give all that you have of your own
   unto him; and truly you have nothing of your own but sin, and,
   therefore, you must give him that. I beseech you, then, say unto Christ
   with bold confidence, I give unto thee, my dear husband, my unbelief,
   my mistrust, my pride, my arrogancy, my ambition, my wrath, and anger,
   my envy, my covetousness, my evil thoughts, affections, and desires; I
   make one bundle of these and all my other offences, and give them unto
   thee. [225] And thus was Christ made "sin for us, that knew no sin,
   that we might be made the righteousness of God in him," [226] (2 Cor
   5:21). "Now then," says Luther, "let us compare these things together,
   and we shall find inestimable treasure. Christ is full of grace, life,
   and saving health; and the soul is freight-full of all sin, death, and
   damnation; but let faith come betwixt these two, and it shall come to
   pass, that Christ shall be laden with sin, death, and hell; and unto
   the soul shall be imputed grace, life, and salvation. Who then is able
   to value the royalty of this marriage accordingly? Who is able to
   comprehend the glorious riches of his grace, where this rich and
   righteous husband, Christ, doth take unto wife this poor and wicked
   harlot, redeeming her from all devils, and garnishing her with all his
   own jewels? So that you, through the assuredness of your faith in
   Christ, your husband, are delivered from all sins, made safe from
   death, guarded from hell, and endowed with the everlasting
   righteousness, life, and saving health of this your husband Christ."
   And, therefore, you are now under the covenant of grace, and freed from
   the law, as it is the covenant of works; for [as Mr. Ball truly says]
   at one and the same time, a man cannot be under the covenant of works
   and the covenant of grace.

   Neo. Sir, I do not well know how to conceive of this freedom from the
   law, as it is the covenant of works; and therefore I pray you make it
   as plain to me as you can.

   Evan. For the true and clear understanding of this point, you are to
   consider, that when Jesus Christ, the second Adam, had, in the behalf
   of his chosen, perfectly fulfilled the law as it is the covenant of
   works; [227] divine justice delivered that bond in to Christ, who
   utterly cancelled that hand-writing, (Col 2:14); so that none of his
   chosen were to have any more to do with it, nor it with them. And now,
   you, by your believing in Christ, having manifested that you are one,
   who was chosen in him "before the foundation of the world," (Eph 1:4),
   his fulfilling of that covenant, and cancelling that hand-writing, is
   imputed unto you; and so you are acquitted and absolved from all your
   transgressions against that covenant, either past, present or to come;
   [228] and so you are justified, as the apostle says, "freely by his
   grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ," (Rom 3:24).

Chapter II, Section III, 6

   Justification before faith, refuted.

   Ant. I pray you, sir, give me leave to speak a word by the way; was not
   he justified before this time?

   Evan. If he did not believe in Christ before this time, as I conceive
   he did not, then certainly he was not justified before this time.

   Ant. But, sir, you know, as the apostle says, "It is God that
   justifieth; and God is eternal; and, as you have shown, Christ may be
   said to have fulfilled the covenant of works from all eternity, and if
   he be Christ's now, then was he Christ's from all eternity." And
   therefore, as I conceive, he was justified from all eternity.

   Evan. Indeed, God is from all eternity, and in respect of God's
   accepting of Christ's undertaking to fulfil the covenant of works, he
   fulfilled it from all eternity: and in respect of God's electing of
   him, he was Christ's from all eternity. And therefore it is true, in
   respect of God's decree, he was justified from all eternity; [229] and
   he was justified meritoriously in the death and resurrection of Christ;
   [230] but yet he was not justified actually, till he did actually
   believe in Christ; for, says the apostle, (Acts 13:39), "By him all
   that believe are justified." [231] So that in the act of justifying,
   faith and Christ must have a mutual relation, and must always concur
   and meet together; faith as the action which apprehendeth, and Christ
   the object which is apprehended; for neither doth Christ justify
   without faith, neither doth faith, except it be in Christ.

   Ant. Truly, sir, you have indifferently well satisfied me in this
   point; and surely I like it marvellously well, that you conclude no
   faith justifies, but that whose object is Christ.

   Evan. The very truth is, though a man believe that God is merciful and
   true to his promise, and that he has his elect number from the
   beginning, and that he himself is one of that number, yet if this faith
   do not eye Christ, if it be not in God as he is in Christ, it will not
   serve the turn: for God cannot be comfortably thought upon out of
   Christ our Mediator; "for if we find not God in Christ," says Calvin,
   Instit. p. 155, "salvation cannot be known." Wherefore, Neophytus, I
   will say unto you, as Mr. Bradford said unto a gentlewoman in your
   case, "Thus, then, if you would be quiet, and certain in conscience,
   then let your faith burst forth through all things, not only that you
   have within you, but also whatsoever is in heaven, earth, and hell; and
   never rest until it come to Christ crucified, and the eternal sweet
   mercy and goodness of God in Christ."

   Chapter II, Section II, 7

   Believers freed from the commanding and condemning power of the
   covenant of works.

   Neo. But, sir, I am not satisfied concerning the point you touched
   before; and therefore, I pray you, proceed to show me how far forth I
   am delivered from the law, as it is the covenant of works.

   Evan. Truly, as it is the covenant of works, you are wholly and
   altogether delivered and set free from it; you are dead to it, and it
   is dead to you; and if it be dead to you, then it can do you neither
   good nor hurt; and if you be dead to it, you can expect neither good
   nor hurt from it. [232] Consider, man, I pray you, that, as I said
   before, you are now under another covenant, viz: the covenant of grace;
   and you cannot be under two covenants at once, neither wholly nor
   partly; and, therefore, as, before you believed, you were wholly under
   the covenant of works, as Adam left both you and all his posterity
   after his fall; so now, since you have believed, you are wholly under
   the covenant of grace. Assure yourself then, that no minister, or
   preacher of God's word has any warrant to say unto you hereafter,
   "Either do this and this duty contained in the law, and avoid this and
   this sin forbidden in the law, and God will justify thee and save thy
   soul: or do it not, and he will condemn thee and damn thee." [233] No,
   no, you are now set free both from the commanding and condemning power
   of the covenant of works. [234] So that I will say unto you, as the
   apostle says unto the believing Hebrews, (Heb 12:18,22,24), "Ye are not
   come to Mount Sinai that might be touched, and that burned with fire;
   nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest; but ye are come unto
   Mount Zion, the city of the living God: and to Jesus, the Mediator of
   the new covenant." So that [to speak with holy reverence] God cannot,
   by virtue of the covenant of works, either require of you any
   obedience, or punish you for any disobedience; no, he cannot, by virtue
   of that covenant, so much as threaten you, or give you an angry word,
   or show you an angry look; for indeed he can see no sin in you, as a
   transgression of that covenant; for, says the apostle, "Where there is
   no law, there is no transgression," (Rom 4:15). [235] And therefore,
   though hereafter you do through frailty transgress any of all the ten
   commandments, [236] yet do you not thereby transgress the covenant of
   works: there is no such covenant now betwixt God and you. [237]

   And therefore, though hereafter you shall hear such a voice as this,
   "If thou wilt be saved, keep the commandments"; or "Cursed is every one
   that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the
   law to do them"; nay, though you hear the voice of thunder and a
   fearful noise; nay, though you see blackness and darkness, and feel a
   great tempest; that is to say, though you hear us that are preachers,
   according to our commission, (Isa 58:1), "lift up our voice like a
   trumpet," in threatening hell and damnation to sinners and
   transgressors of the law; though these be the words of God, yet are you
   not to think that they are spoken to you. [238] No, no; the apostle
   assures you that there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ
   Jesus, (Rom 8:1). Believe it, God never threatens eternal death, after
   he has given to a man eternal life. [239] Nay, the truth is, God never
   speaks to a believer out of Christ; and in Christ he speaks not a word
   in the terms of the covenant of works. [240] And if the law, of itself,
   should presume to come into your conscience, and say, "Herein and
   herein thou hast transgressed, and broken me, and therefore thou owest
   so much and so much to divine justice, which must be satisfied, or else
   I will take hold on thee"; then answer you and say, "O law! be it known
   unto thee, that I am now married unto Christ, and so I am under covert;
   and therefore if thou charge me with any debt, thou must enter thine
   action against my husband, Christ, for the wife is not sueable at the
   law, but the husband. But the truth is, I through him am dead to thee,
   O law! and thou art dead to me; and therefore Justice hath nothing to
   do with me, for it judgeth according to the law." [241] And if it yet
   reply, and say, "Aye, but good works must be done and the commandments
   must be kept, if thou wilt obtain salvation"; [242] then answer you,
   and say, "I am already saved before thou camest; [243] and therefore I
   have no need of thy presence, [244] for in Christ I have all things at
   once: neither need I any thing more that is necessary [245] to
   salvation. He is my righteousness, my treasure, and work; [246] I
   confess, O law! that I am neither godly nor righteous, [247] but yet
   this I am sure of, that he is godly and righteous for me. [248] And to
   tell the truth, O law! I am now with him in the bridechamber, where it
   maketh no matter what I am, [249] or what I have done; but what Christ,
   my sweet husband, is, has done, and does for me: [250] and therefore
   leave off, law, to dispute with me, for by faith 'I apprehend him who
   hath apprehended me,' and put me into his bosom. Wherefore I will be
   bold to bid Moses with his tables, and all lawyers with their books,
   and all men with their works, hold their peace and give place: [251] so
   that I say unto thee, O law! be gone." And if it will not be gone, then
   thrust it out by force, says Luther. [252]

   And if sin offer to take hold of you, as David said his did on him,
   (Psa 40:12); then say you unto it, "Thy strength, O sin, is the law, (1
   Cor 15:66), and the law is dead to me, So that, O sin, thy strength is
   gone; and therefore be sure thou shalt never be able to prevail against
   me, nor do me any hurt at all." [253]

   And if Satan take you by the throat, and by violence draw you before
   God's judgment-seat, then call to your husband, Christ, and say, "Lord,
   I suffer violence, make answer for me, and help me." And by his help
   you shall be enabled to plead for yourself, after this manner: O God
   the Father! I am thy Son Christ's; thou gavest me unto him, and thou
   hast given unto him "all power, both in heaven and in earth, and hast
   committed all judgment to him"; and therefore I will stand to his
   judgment, who says, "he came not to judge the world, but to save it";
   and therefore he will save me, according to his office. And if the jury
   [254] should [255] bring in their verdict that they have found you
   guilty, then speak to the Judge, and say, In case any must be condemned
   for my transgressions, it must needs be Christ, and not I; for albeit I
   have committed them, yet he hath undertaken and bound himself to answer
   for them, and that by the consent and good-will of God his Father: and
   indeed he hath fully satisfied for them.

   And if death creep upon you, and attempt to devour you; then say, "Thy
   sting, O death! is sin; and Christ my husband has fully vanquished sin,
   and so deprived thee of thy sting; and therefore do I not fear any hurt
   that thou, O death! canst do unto me." And thus you may triumph with
   the apostle, saying, "Thanks be unto God, who hath given me the
   victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ," (1 Cor 15:56,57).

   And thus have I also declared unto you how Christ, in the fullness of
   time, performed that which God before all time purposed, and in time
   promised, touching the helping and delivering of fallen mankind.

   And so have I also done with the "Law of Faith."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [44] (2 Tim 1:9), "Who hath saved us according to his own purpose and
   grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world
   began."--(Eph 3:11), "According to the eternal purpose, which he
   purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord."

   [45] (Rom 1:1,2), "The gospel of God, which he had promised afore by
   his prophets in the holy Scriptures."

   [46] (Gal 4:4,5), "But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent
   forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that
   were under the law."

   [47] These are the good tidings, this is the law of faith, i.e. the law
   to be believed for salvation, which the apostle plainly teacheth. (Rom
   1:16), "The gospel is the power of God unto salvation to every one that
   believeth"; and, (verse 17), "For therein is the righteousness of God
   revealed from faith to faith." In this last text, clouded with a great
   variety of interpretations, I think there is a transposition of words
   to be admitted, and would read the whole verse thus: "For therein is
   revealed the righteousness of God by faith unto faith; as it is
   written, But the just by faith shall live." The key to this
   construction and reading of the words in the former part of the verse,
   is, the testimony adduced by the apostle in the latter part of it, from
   Habakkuk 2:4, where the original text appears to me to determine the
   version of that testimony as here offered. The sense is, the
   righteousness which is by faith, namely, the righteousness of Christ,
   the only righteousness in which a sinner can stand before God, is in
   the gospel revealed unto faith, i.e. to be believed. See a like phrase,
   1 Timothy 4:3, translated after this manner.

   [48] "How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee,
   Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim?
   Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together,"
   (Hosea 11:8).

   [49] Mercy requires an object in misery.

   [50] Favour and compassion.

   [51] As man lay in ruins, by the fall guilty and unclean, there stood
   int he way of his salvation, by mercy designed, 1. The justice of God,
   which could not admit the guilty creature; and, 2. The holiness of God,
   which could not admit the unclean and unholy creature to communion with
   him. Therefore, in the contrivance of his salvation, it was necessary
   that provision should be made for the satisfaction of God's justice, by
   payment of the double debt mentioned above; namely, the debt of
   punishment and the debt of perfect obedience. It was also necessary
   that provision should be made for the sanctification of the sinner, the
   repairing of the lost image of God in him. And man being as unable to
   sanctify himself, as to satisfy justice, [a truth which proud nature
   cannot digest], the Saviour behoved, not only to obey and suffer in his
   stead, but also to have a fullness of the Spirit of holiness in him to
   communicate to the sinner, that his nature might be repaired through
   sanctification of the Spirit. Thus was the groundwork of man's
   salvation laid in the eternal counsel; the sanctification of the
   sinner, according to our author, being as necessary to his salvation as
   the satisfaction of justice; for indeed the necessity of the former, as
   well as of the latter, ariseth from the nature of God, and therefore is
   an absolute necessity.

   [52] That is, the debt which the elect owe to me. Thus was the covenant
   made betwixt the Father and the Son for the elect, that he should obey
   for them, and die for them.

   [53] The Son of God consented to put himself in man's stead, in obeying
   his Father, and so to do all for man that his Father should require,
   that satisfaction should be made: farther, he consented, in man's
   nature, to satisfy and suffer the deserved punishment, that the same
   nature that sinned might satisfy; and yet farther, he undertook to bear
   the very same penalty that lay upon man, by virtue of the covenant of
   works, to have undergone; so making himself a proper surety for them,
   who, as the author observes, must pay the sum of money that the debtor
   oweth. This I take to be the author's meaning; but the expression of
   "Christ's undertaking under the penalty," &c., is harsh and unguarded.

   [54] Our Lord Jesus Christ became surety for the elect in the second
   covenant, (Heb 8:22); and in virtue of that suretyship, whereby he put
   himself in the room of the principal debtors, he came under the same
   covenant of works that Adam did; in so far as the fulfilling of that
   covenant in their stead was the very condition required of him, as the
   second Adam in the second covenant. (Gal 4:4,5), "God sent forth his
   Son; made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law." Thus
   Christ put his neck under the yoke of the law as a covenant of works,
   to redeem them who were under it as such. Hence he is said to be the
   "end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth," (Rom
   10:4); namely, the end for consummation, or perfect fulfilling of it by
   his obedience and death, which pre-supposeth his coming under it. And
   thus the law as a covenant of works was magnified and made honourable;
   and it clearly appears how "by faith we establish the law," (Rom 3:31).
   How then is the second covenant a covenant of grace? In respect of
   Christ, it was most properly and strictly a covenant of works, in that
   he made a proper, real, and full satisfaction in behalf of the elect;
   but in respect of them, it is purely a covenant of richest grace, in as
   much as God accepted the satisfaction from a surety, which he might
   have demanded of them; provided the surety himself, and gives all to
   them freely for his sake.

   [55] And so, in relation to them, is called the "first man."

   [56] Thus Adam represented all mankind in the first covenant, and
   Christ represented all the elect in the second covenant.--See the first
   note on the Preface.

   [57] This, our author does here positively assert, and afterwards
   confirm. And there is plain evidence for it from the holy Scriptures,
   which determines the time of our Lord's calling our guilty first
   parents before him, at the which time he gave them the promise. (Gen
   3:8), "And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden
   in the cool of the day"; [Heb, "At the wind of that day," as Junius and
   Tremellius, Piscator and Picherellus, read it;] the which, as soon as
   it began to blow, might convince them that their aprons of fig- leaves
   were not fit covers for their nakedness.

   [58] Our author is far from being singular in this opinion. The learned
   Gataker, [apud Pol. Synop. Crit. in Genesis 3:23,] owns it to be the
   common opinion, though he himself is of another mind, "That man fell,
   and was cast out of paradise, the same day in which he was created."
   And he tells us, [Ibid. in Psalm 49:13,] that "Broughton does most
   confidently assert Adam not to have stood in his integrity so much as
   one day; and that he saith, out of Maimonides, This is held by all the
   Jews, as also by the Greek fathers." That this opinion is less received
   than formerly, is, if I mistake not, not a little owing to the cavils
   of the Deists; who, to weaken the credit of the inspired history,
   allege it to be incredible that the events recorded (Gen 1:24-26,
   2:7,18, to the end of the third chapter), could all be crowded into one
   day. [See Nichol's Conference with a Theist.] The reasons to support
   it, taken from the learned Sharp, one of the six ministers banished in
   the year 1606. [Curs. Theol. Loc. de Peccato.] 1. "Because of the
   devil's envy, who, it is likely, could not long endure to see a man in
   a happy state. 2. If man had stood more days, the blessing of marriage
   would have taken place, Adam would have known his wife, and begot a
   child without original sin. 3. The Sabbath was not so much appointed
   for meditating on the works of creation, as on the work of redemption.
   4. It appears from the words of the serpent, and of the woman, that she
   had not yet tasted any fruit. 5. When the Holy Ghost speaks of the
   sixth day, (Gen 1), and of the day of the fall, it is with HE emphatic.
   [Compare Genesis 1 ult. and 3:8.] 6. He fell so soon, that the work of
   redemption might be the more illustrious, since man could not stand one
   day without the Mediator's help." How the Sabbath was broken by Adam's
   sin, though committed the day before, may be learned from the Larger
   Catechism, on the fourth commandment, which teaches, that "The Sabbath
   is to be sanctified--and to that end we are to prepare our hearts--that
   we may be the more fit for the duties of that day": and that "the sins
   forbidden in the fourth commandment, are all omissions of the duties
   required," &c.

   [59] In this promise was revealed, 1. Man's restoration unto the favour
   of God, and his salvation; not to be effected by man himself, and his
   own works, but by another. For our first parents, standing condemned
   for breaking of the covenant of works, are not sent back to it, to
   essay the mending of the matter, which they had marred before; but a
   new covenant is purposed,--a Saviour promised as their only hope. 2.
   That this Saviour was to be incarnate, to become man, "the seed of the
   women." 3. That he behoved to suffer; his heel, namely his humanity, to
   be bruised to death. 4. That by his death he should make a full
   conquest over the devil, and destroy his works, who had now overcome
   and destroyed mankind; and so recover the captives out of his hand: "he
   shall bruise thy head, viz: while thou bruisest his heel." This
   encounter was on the cross: there Christ treading on the serpent, it
   bruised his heel, but he bruised its head. 5. That he should not be
   held by death, but Satan's power should be broken irrecoverably: the
   Saviour being only bruised in the heel, but the serpent in the head. 6.
   That the saving interest in him, and his salvation, is by faith alone,
   believing the promise with particular application to one's self, and so
   receiving him, forasmuch as these things are revealed by way of a
   simple promise.

   [60] "From this text the Hebrew doctors, also in Bereshit Rabba, do
   gather, that the glory of the first man did not night with him, and
   that in the beginning of the Sabbath his splendour was taken away from
   him, and he was driven out of Eden."--[Cartwright and Pol. Synops.
   Crit. in Loc.] The learned Leigh, [in his Crit. Sacr. in voc. Lun,]
   citing this text, says, "Adam lodged not one night in honour, for so
   are the words, if they be properly translated." He repeats the same in
   his annotations on the book of Psalms, and points his reader to
   Ainsworth, whose version does evidently favour this opinion, and is
   here faithfully cited by our author, though without the marks of
   composition--"lodge a night," there being no such marks in my copy of
   Ainsworth's version or annotations, printed at London, 1639. However
   the word lun may signify, to abide or continue, it is certain the
   proper and primary signification of it is, tonight [at, in, or with]. I
   must be allowed the use of this word to express the true import of the
   original one. Thus we have it rendered, (Gen 28:11), "tarried all
   night."--(Judg 19:9,10,13), "Tarry all night--tarry that night--lodged
   all night." And since this is the proper and primary signification of
   the word, it is not to be receded from, without necessity; the which I
   cannot discover here. The text seems to me to stand thus, word for
   word, the propriety of the tenses also observed: "Yet Adam in honour
   could not night; he became like as the beasts, they were alike."
   Compare the Septuagint, and the vulgar Latin; with which, according to
   Pool, [in Synop. Crit.,] the Ethiopic, Syriac, and Arabic, do agree,
   though unhappy in not observing the difference between this and the
   last verse of the Psalm. Nothing can be more agreeable to the scope and
   content. Worldly men boast themselves in the multitude of their riches,
   (verse 6), as if their houses should continue for ever, (verse 11); and
   yet Adam, as happy as he was in paradise, continued not one night in
   his honour; it quickly left him; yea, he died, and in that respect
   became like the beasts; (compare verse 14), "Like sheep they are laid
   in the grave, death shall feed on them." And after showing that the
   worldly man shall die, notwithstanding of his worldly wealth and
   honour, (verse 19), this suitable memorial for Adam's sons is repeated
   with a very small variation, (verse 20,21), "Adam was in honour, but
   could not understand; he became," &c.

   [61] That the promise was given the same day that Adam sinned, was
   evinced before: and from the history, (Gen 3), and the nature of the
   thing itself, one may reasonably conclude, that the sacrifices were
   annexed to the promise. And since the hour of Christ's death was all
   along the time of the evening sacrifice, it is very natural to reckon
   that it was also the hour of the first sacrifice; even as the place on
   which the temple stood was at first designed by an extraordinary
   sacrifice on that spot, (1 Chron 20:18-28, 22:1). 1. "At three o'clock
   in the afternoon, Christ yielded up the Ghost, (Mark 15:34,) the very
   time when Adam had received the promise of this his passion for his
   redemption."--Lightfoot on Acts 2:1.

   [62] This word might well have been spared here; notwithstanding that
   we so read in the title of the book of the Revelation in our English
   Bibles; and in like manner, in the titles of other books in the New
   Testament, St. [i.e. Saint] Matthew, St. Mark, St. Luke, &c.; it is
   evident, there is not such a word to be found in the titles of these
   books in the original Greek; and the Dutch translators have justly
   discarded it out of their translations. If it is to be retained,
   because John, Matthew, Mark, Luke, &c., were, without controversy,
   saints, why not on the same ground, Saint Moses, Saint Aaron,
   [expressly called "the Saint of the Lord," (Psa 106:16)] &c.? No reason
   can be given of the difference made in this point, but that it pleased
   Antichrist to canonize these New Testament saints, but not the Old
   Testament ones. Canonizing is an act or sentence of the Pope, decreeing
   religious worship and honours to such men or women departed, as he sees
   meet to confer the honour of saintship on. These honours are seven, and
   the first of them is, "That they are enrolled in the catalogue of
   saints, and must be accounted and called saints by all."--Bellarmin
   Disp. tom. 1. Col. 1496.

   [63] The benefits thereof [viz: of Christ's redemption] "were
   communicated unto the elect from the beginning of the world in and by
   those promises, types, and sacrifices, wherein he was revealed, and
   signified to be the Seed of the woman which should bruise the serpent's
   head, and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world."--Westm.
   Confess. chap. 8, art. 6.

   [64] So the Septuagint expounds it. Others, an enlivener, not doubting
   but Adam, in giving her this name, had the promised life- giving Seed,
   our Lord Jesus Christ, particularly in view, amongst the "all living"
   she was to be mother of.

   [65] The ancient promise given to Adam was the first gospel, the
   covenant of grace; for man, by his fall, "having made himself incapable
   of life by the covenant of works, the Lord was pleased to make a
   second, commonly called the covenant of grace," (Gen 3:15). Westm.
   Confess. chap. 7, art. 3. When that promise or covenant, in which the
   persons it respected were not expressly designed, was renewed, Abraham
   and his seed were designed expressly therein; and so it became a
   covenant with Abraham and his seed. And the promise being still the
   same as to the substance of it, was often repeated, and in the
   repetition more fully and clearly opened. So Jesus Christ, revealed to
   Adam only as the seed of the woman, was thereafter revealed to Abraham
   as Abraham's own seed; and thus was it believed and embraced unto
   salvation in the various revelations thereof. "God did seek Adam again,
   call upon him, rebuke his sin, convict him of the same; and, in the
   end, made unto him a most joyful promise, viz: that the seed of the
   woman should break down the serpent's head; that is, he should destroy
   the works of the devil; which promise, as it was repeated, and made
   more clear from time to time, so was it embraced with joy, and may
   constantly [i.e. most steadfastly] be received of all the faithful,
   from Adam to Noe, and from Noe to Abraham, from Abraham to David, and
   so, forth to the incarnation of Christ Jesus." Old Confess. art. 4.

   [66] That passed betwixt the Father and the Son from everlasting.

   [67] Melchisedec was unto Abraham a type, to confirm him in the faith,
   that he and his believing seed should be as really blessed in Christ,
   as he was blessed by Melchisedec.

   [68] This seems to me to be a more than groundless opinion, as being
   inconsistent with the Scripture account of Melchisedec, (Gen 14:18, Heb
   7:1-4); howbeit it wants no patrons among the learned; the declaring of
   which is no just ground to fit it on our author, especially after his
   speaking so plainly of Christ and Melchisedec as two different persons,
   a little before. The text, (John 8:56), alleged by the patrons of that
   opinion, makes nothing for their purpose: "for all [we mean the
   faithful fathers under the law] did see [viz: by faith] the joyful day
   of Christ Jesus, and did rejoice." Old Confess. art. 4.

   [69] Namely, the passing of the furnace and burning lamp between the
   pieces.

   [70] (Heb 9:22), "And almost all things are by the law purged with
   blood: and without shedding of blood is no remission." Compare Genesis
   17:14, "The uncircumcised man-child shall be cut off from his people:
   he hath broken my covenant."

   [71] Namely, the promises of the everlasting inheritance, typified by
   the land of Canaan: the which promises see in Genesis 12:7, and 13:15.

   [72] That is, Christ mystical, Christ and the Church, the head and the
   members; yet so as the dignity of the head being still reservedâ?"he is
   to be understood here primarily, which is sufficient for our author's
   purposes; and his members secondarily only.

   [73] That these three, together with Abraham, are here meant by the
   apostle, and not these mentioned in the first seven verses of the
   chapter, if it is considered, that of them he spoke last, (verse 9,11).
   To none before them was the promise of Canaan given; and they were the
   persons who had opportunity to have returned to the country whence they
   came out, (verse 15).

   [74] That is, the deliverance of the Israelites out of Egypt was a
   figure of the redemption of believers by Christ.

   [75] Not that it prefigured or represented baptism as a proper and
   prophetical type thereof, though some orthodox divines seem to be of
   that mind; but that, as the author expresses himself, in the case of
   the manna and the water out of the rock, it resembled baptism, being a
   like figure [or type] thereunto, as the apostle Peter determines,
   concerning Noah's ark with the waters of the deluge, (1 Peter 3:21),
   even as the printer's types of the letters impressed on the paper, both
   signifying one and the same word. For the ancient church is expressly
   said to have been "baptized in the sea," (1 Cor 10:1,2), and as the
   rock, with the waters flowing from it, did not signify the Lord's
   Supper, but the thing signified by that New Testament Sacrament,
   namely, Christ, (verse 4), so their baptism in the sea did not signify
   our baptism itself, but the thing represented thereby. And thus it was
   a type or figure answering to and resembling the baptism of the New
   Testament-church; the one being an extraordinary sacrament of the Old
   Testament, and the other an ordinary sacrament of the New, both
   representing the same thing.

   [76] As to this point, there are different sentiments among orthodox
   divines; though all of them do agree, that the way of salvation was the
   same under the Old and New Testament, and that the Sinai covenant,
   whatever it was, carried no prejudice to the promise made unto Abraham,
   and the way of salvation therein revealed, but served to lead men to
   Jesus Christ. Our author is far from being singular in this decision of
   this question. I adduce only the testimonies of three late learned
   writers, "That God made such a covenant [viz: the covenant of works]
   with our first parents, is confirmed by several parts of Scripture,"
   (Hosea 6:7, Gal 4:24),--Willison's Sacr. Cat. p. 3. The words of the
   text last quoted are these: "For these are the two covenants, the one
   from the Mount Sinai which gendereth to bondage." Hence it appears,
   that in the judgment of this author, the covenant from Mount Sinai was
   the covenant of works, otherwise there is no shadow of reason from this
   text for what it is adduced to prove. The Rev. Messrs. Flint and
   M'Claren, in their elaborate and seasonable treatise against Professor
   Simpson's doctrine, [for which I make no question but their names will
   be in honour with posterity] speak to the same purpose. The former
   having adduced the fore-cited text, (Gal 4:24), says, Jam duo federa,
   &c., that is, "Now here are two covenants mentioned, the first the
   legal one, by sin rendered ineffectual, entered into with Adam, and now
   again promulgate." [Exam. Doctr. Joh. Simp. p. 125.] And afterwards,
   speaking of the law of works, he adds, Atque hoc est illud fadus, &c.,
   that is, "And this is that covenant promulgate on Mount Sinai, which is
   called one of the covenants," (Gal 4:24). Ibid. p. 131. The words of
   the latter, speaking of the covenant of works are these, "Yea, it is
   expressly called a covenant," (Hosea 6, Gal 4). And Mr. Gillespie
   proves strongly, that Galations 4 is understood of the covenant of
   works and grace. See his Ark of the Testament, part 1. chap. 5. p. 180.
   The New Scheme Examined, p. 176. The delivering of the ten commandments
   on Mount Sinai as the covenant of works, necessarily includes in it the
   delivering of them as a perfect rule of righteousness; forasmuch as
   that covenant did always contain in it such a rule, the true knowledge
   of which the Israelites were at that time in great want of, as our
   author afterwards teaches.

   [77] The strength of the objection in the preceding paragraph lies
   here, namely, that at this rate, the same person, at one and the same
   time, were both under the covenant of works, and under the covenant of
   grace, which is absurd. Ans. The unbelieving Israelites were under the
   covenant of grace made with their father Abraham externally and by
   profession, in respect of their visible church state; but under the
   covenant of works made with their father Adam internally and really, in
   respect of the state of their souls before the Lord. Herein there is no
   absurdity; for to this day many in the visible church are thus, in
   these different respects, under both covenants. Farther, as to
   believers among them, they were internally and really, as well as
   externally, under the covenant of grace; and only externally under the
   covenant of works, and that, not as a covenant co-ordinate with, but
   subordinate and subservient unto, the covenant of grace: and in this
   there is no more inconsistency than in the former.

   [78] As delivered from the covenant of works, by virtue of the covenant
   of grace.

   [79] That will not, indeed, prove them all to have been the people of
   God in the sense before given, for the reason here adduced by our
   author. Howbeit, the preface to the ten commandments deserves a
   particular notice in the matter of the Sinai transaction, (Exo 20:2),
   "I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of
   Egypt, out of the house of bondage." Hence it is evident to me, that
   the covenant of grace was delivered to the Israelites on Mount Sinai.
   For the Son of God, the messenger of the covenant of grace, spoke these
   words to a select people, the natural seed of Abraham, typical of his
   whole spiritual seed. He avoucheth himself to be their God; namely, in
   virtue of the promise, or covenant made with Abraham, (Gen 17:7), "I
   will establish my covenant--to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed
   after thee": and their God, which brought them out of the land of
   Egypt; according to the promise made to Abraham at the most solemn
   renewal of the covenant with him.--(Gen 15:14), "Afterwards shall they
   come out with great substance. And he first declares himself their God,
   and then requires obedience, according to the manner of the covenant
   with Abraham, (Gen 17:1); "I am the Almighty God, [i.e. in the language
   of the covenant, The Almighty God TO THEE, to make THEE for ever blest
   through the promised SEED,] walk thou before me, and be thou perfect."
   But that the covenant of works was also, for special ends, repeated and
   delivered to the Israelites on Mount Sinai, I cannot refuse, 1. Because
   of the apostle's testimony, (Gal 4:24), "These are the two covenants;
   the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage." For the children
   of this Sinai covenant the apostle here treats of, are excluded from
   the eternal inheritance, as Ishmael was from Canaan, the type of it,
   (verse 30), "Cast out the bond-woman and her son; for the son of the
   bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman"; but this
   could never be said of the children of the covenant of grace under any
   dispensation, though both the law and covenant from Sinai itself, and
   its children, were even before the coming of Christ under a sentence of
   exclusion, to be executed on them respectively in due time. 2. The
   nature of the covenant of works is most expressly in the New Testament
   brought in, propounded, and explained from the Mosaical dispensation.
   The commands of it from Exodus 20 by our blessed Saviour, (Matt
   19:17-19), "If thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments. He
   saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, thou shalt
   not commit adultery," &c. The promise of it, (Rom 10:5), "Moses
   describes the righteousness which is of the law, that the man which
   doth these things shall live by them." The commands and promise of it
   together, see Luke 10:25-28. The terrible sanction of it, Galations
   3:10. For it is written [viz: Deuteronomy 27:26,] "Cursed is every one
   that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the
   law to do them." 3. To this may be added the opposition betwixt the law
   and grace, so frequently inculcated in the New Testament, especially in
   Paul's epistles. See one text for all, (Gal 3:12), "And the law is not
   of faith, but the man that doeth them shall live in them." 4. The law
   from Mount Sinai was a covenant, (Gal 4:24), "These are the two
   covenants, the one from the Mount Sinai"; and such a covenant as had a
   semblance of disannulling the covenant of grace, (Gal 3:17), "The
   covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law which was
   430 years after, cannot disannul"; yea, such an one as did, in its own
   nature, bear a method of obtaining the inheritance, so far different
   from that of the promise, that it was inconsistent with it; "For if the
   inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise," (Gal 3:18),
   wherefore the covenant of the law from Mount Sinai could not be the
   covenant of grace, unless one will make this last not only a covenant
   seeming to destroy itself, but really inconsistent: but it was the
   covenant of works, which indeed had such a semblance, and in its own
   nature did bear such a method as before noted; howbeit, as Ainsworth
   says, "The covenant of the law now given could not disannul the
   covenant of grace," (Gal 3:17). Annot. on Exodus 19:1 Wherefore I
   conceive the two covenants to have been both delivered on Mount Sinai
   to the Israelites. First, The covenant of grace made with Abraham,
   contained in the preface, repeated and promulgate there unto Israel, to
   be believed and embraced by faith, that they might be saved; to which
   were annexed the ten commandments, given by the Mediator Christ, the
   head of the covenant, as a rule of life to his covenant people.
   Secondly, the covenant of works made with Adam, contained in the same
   ten commands, delivered with thunderings and lightnings, the meaning of
   which was afterwards cleared by Moses, describing the righteousness of
   the law and sanction thereof, repeated and promulgate to the Israelites
   there, as the original perfect rule of righteousness, to be obeyed; and
   yet were they no more bound hereby to seek righteousness by the law
   than the young man was by our Saviour's saying to him, (Matt 19:17,18),
   "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments--Thou shalt do no
   murder," &c. The latter was a repetition of the former. Thus there is
   no confounding of the two covenants of grace and works; but the latter
   was added to the former as subservient unto it, to turn their eyes
   towards the promise, or covenant of grace: "God gave it to Abraham by
   promise. Wherefore then serveth the law? it was added, because of
   transgressions, till the Seed should come," (Gal 3:18,19). So it was
   unto the promise given to Abraham, that this subservient covenant was
   added; and that promise we have found in the preface to the ten
   commands. To it, then was the subservient covenant, according to the
   apostle, added, put, or set to, as the word properly signifies. So it
   was no part of the covenant of grace, the which was entire to the
   fathers, before the time that was set to it; and yet is, to the New
   Testament church, after that is taken away from it: for, says the
   apostle, "It was added till the seed should come." Hence it appears
   that the covenant of grace was, both in itself, and in God's intention,
   the principal part of the Sinai transaction: nevertheless, the covenant
   of works was the most conspicuous part of it, and lay most open to the
   view of the people. According to this account of the Sinai transaction,
   the ten commands, there delivered, must come under a twofold notion or
   consideration; namely, as the law of Christ, and as the law of works:
   and this is not strange, if it is considered, that they were twice
   written on tables of stone, by the Lord himself,--the first tables the
   work of God, (Exo 32:16), which were broken in pieces, (verse 19),
   called the tables of the covenant, (Deut 9:11,15)--the second tables,
   the work of Moses, the typical Mediator, (Exo 34:1), deposited at first
   [it would seem] in the tabernacle mentioned, (33:7), afterward, at the
   rearing of the tabernacle with all its furniture, laid up in the ark
   within the tabernacle, (25:16); and whether or not, some such thing is
   intimated, by the double accentuation of the decalogue, let the learned
   determine; but to the ocular inspection it is evident, that the preface
   to the ten commands, (Exo 20:2, Deut 5:6), stands in the original, both
   as a part of a sentence joined to the first commands, and also as an
   entire sentence, separated from it, and shut up by itself. Upon the
   whole, one may compare with this the first promulgation of the covenant
   of grace, by the messenger of the covenant in paradise, (Gen 3:15), and
   the flaming sword placed there by the same hand, "turning every way to
   keep the way of the tree of life."

   [80] Here, there is a large addition in the ninth edition of this book,
   London, 1699. It well deserves a place, and is as follows: "I do not
   say, God made the covenant of works with them, that they might obtain
   life and salvation thereby; no, the law was become weak through the
   flesh, as to any such purpose, (Rom 8:3). But he repeated, or gave a
   new edition of the law, and that, as a covenant of works, for their
   humbling and conviction; and so do his ministers preach the law to
   unconverted sinners still, that they who 'desire to be under the law
   may hear what the law says,' (Gal 4:21). And as to what you say of
   their not agreeing to this covenant, I pray take notice, that the
   covenant of works was made with Adam, not for himself only, but as he
   was a public person representing all his posterity, and so that
   covenant was made with the whole nature of man in him, as appears by
   Adam's sin and curse coming upon all, (Rom 5:12, Gal 3:10). Hence all
   men are born under that covenant, whether they agree to it or no;
   though, indeed, there is by nature such a proneness in all to desire to
   be under that covenant, and to work for life, that if natural men's
   consent were asked, they would readily [though ignorantly] take upon
   them to do all that the Lord requireth; for do you not remember," &c.

   [81] That the conditional promise, (Lev 18:5), [to which agrees Exodus
   19:8,] and the dreadful threatening, (Deut 27:26), were both given to
   the Israelites, as well as the ten commands, is beyond question; and
   that according to the apostle, (Rom 10:5, Gal 3:10), they were the form
   of the covenant of works, is as evident as the repeating of the words,
   and expounding them so, can make it. How, then, one can refuse the
   covenant of works to have been given to the Israelites, I cannot see.
   Mark the Westminster Confession upon the head of the covenant of works;
   "The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life
   was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity, upon condition of
   perfect and personal obedience." And this account of the being and
   nature of that covenant is there proved from these very texts among
   others, Romans 10:5, Galatians 3:10, chap. 7, art. 2.

   [82] "But the covenant of the law [adds he] came after, as the apostle
   observeth, (Gen 3:17).--They had a greater benefit than their fathers;
   for though the law could not give them life, yet it was a schoolmaster
   unto, i.e., to bring them unto, Christ." (Gal 3:21-24). Ainsworth on
   Deuteronomy 5:3.

   [83] The transaction at Sinai or Horeb [for they are but one mountain]
   was a mixed dispensation; there was the promise or covenant of grace,
   and also the law; the one a covenant to be believed, the other a
   covenant to be done, and thus the apostle states, the difference
   betwixt these two, (Gal 3:12), "And the law is not of faith, but the
   man that DOETH them shall live in them." As to the former, viz: the
   covenant to be believed, it was given to their fathers as well as to
   them. Of the latter, viz: the covenant to be done, Moses speaks
   expressly, (Deut 4:12,13), "The Lord spake unto you out of the midst of
   the fire, and he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you
   to PERFORM [or DO] even ten commandments." And (5:3), he tells the
   people no less expressly, that "the Lord made not THIS COVENANT with
   their fathers."

   [84] That is, had worn them out, in the same measure and degree as the
   light of nature was darkened; but neither the one nor the other was
   ever fully done. (Rom 2:14,15).

   [85] Wherein I differ from this learned author as to this point, and
   for what reasons, may be seen earlier [footnote #4].

   [86] But not as it is a rule of life, which is the other member of that
   distinction.

   [87] Both in the heart of Adam himself, and of his descendants in the
   first ages of the world.

   [88] Both with him and them.

   [89] The doctrine of the fall, with whatsoever other doctrine was
   necessary to salvation, was handed down from Adam, the fathers
   communicating the same to their children and children's children. There
   were but eleven patriarchs before the flood; 1. Adam, 2. Seth, 3. Enos,
   4. Cainan, 5. Mahalaleel, 6. Jared, 7. Enoch, 8, Methuselah, 9. Lamech,
   10. Noah, 11. Shem. Adam having lived 930 years, (Gen 5:5), was known
   to Lamech, Noah's father, with whom he lived 66 years, and much longer
   with the rest of the fathers before him; so that Lamech, and those
   before him, might have the doctrine from Adam's own mouth. Methuselah
   lived with Adam 243 years, and with Shem 98 years before the deluge.
   See Genesis 5. And what Shem, who, after the deluge, lived 502 years,
   (Gen 11:10,11), had learned from Methuselah, he had occasion to teach
   Arphaxad, Salah, Eber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, Abraham, Isaac,
   (Gen 21:5,), and Jacob, to whose 51st year he [viz: Shem] reached.
   Genesis 11:10, and 21:5, and 25:26, compared. [Vid. Bail. Op. Hist.
   Chron. p. 2, 3.] Thus one may perceive, how the nature of the law and
   covenant of works given to Adam, might be far better known to them,
   than to the Israelites after their long bondage in Egypt.

   [90] That is, and besides all this, God spake to the patriarchs
   immediately and by angels. But neither of these do we find during the
   time of the bondage in Egypt, until the angel of the Lord appeared to
   Moses in the bush, and ordered him to go and bring the people out of
   Egypt, (Exo 3).

   [91] The remaining impressions of the law on the hearts of the
   Israelites.

   [92] By faith; believing, embracing, and appropriating it to
   themselves, (Heb 11:13, Jer 3:4).

   [93] Inasmuch as the remaining impressions of the law on their hearts
   were so weak, that they were not sufficient for the purpose.

   [94] By faith proposing it as their only defence, and opposing it to
   the demands of the law or covenant of works, as their only plea.

   [95] How far they came short of, and could not reach unto the obedience
   they owed unto God, according to the perfection of the holy law.

   [96] Nor before the fall neither, properly speaking; but the expression
   is agreeable to Scripture style, (Isa 5:4), "Wherefore when I looked it
   should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?"

   [97] (Rom 8:3), "For what the law could not DO, in that it was weak
   through the flesh; God sending his own Son," &c.

   [98] It was not set up by itself as an entire rule of righteousness, to
   which alone they were to look who desired righteousness and salvation,
   as it was in the case of upright Adam, "For no man, since the fall, can
   attain to righteousness and life by the moral law," Lar. Cat. quest.
   94. But it was added to the covenant of grace, that by looking at it
   men might see what kind of righteousness it is by which they can be
   justified in the sight of God; and that by means thereof, finding
   themselves destitute of that righteousness, they might be moved to
   embrace the covenant of grace, in which that righteousness is held
   forth to be received by faith.

   [99] This was the end of the work, namely, of making the covenant of
   works with Adam, but not of the repeating of it at Sinai; it was also
   the end or design of the worker, namely of God, who made that covenant
   with Adam, to have his due from man, and he got it from the Man Christ
   Jesus.

   [100] That is, the perfect obedience of the law; as it is said, (Eccl
   7:29), "God made man upright."

   [101] I see no warrant for restraining the sense of this text to their
   desiring a mediator. The universal term, "All that they have spoken,"
   includes also their engaging to receive the law at the mouth of the
   mediator, which is joined with their desire (verse 27): "Go thou near,
   and hear all that the Lord our God shall say; and speak thou unto us
   all that the Lord our God shall speak unto thee, and we will hear and
   do," (verse 28). And the Lord said, "They have well said all that they
   have spoken." But there is a palpable difference between what they
   spoke, (Exo 19:8), and what they spoke here, relative to their own
   practice. The former runs thus: "All that the Lord hath spoken we will
   do"; the latter thus: "And we will hear and do"; the original text
   bears no more. The one, relates to obedience only, the other to faith
   also,--"We will HEAR," i.e., believe, (Isa 55:3, John 9:27). Hence the
   object of faith, that which is to be believed, is called a report,
   properly a hearing, (Isa 53:1, Rom 10:16). The former speaks much blind
   self-confidence; the latter a sense of duty and a willing mind, but
   with all a sense of duty and fear of mismanagement.

   [102] Making a promise of Christ to them, not only as "the seed of the
   woman," but as "the seed of Abraham," and yet more particularly, as
   "the seed of Israel: the Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a
   prophet, from the midst of THEE, of THY BRETHREN," (Deut 18:15). And
   here it is to be observed, that this renewing of the promise and
   covenant of grace with them was immediately upon the back of the giving
   of the law on Mount Sinai, for at that time was their speech which the
   Lord commended as well spoken: this appears from Exodus 20:18,19,
   compared with Deuteronomy 5:23-28, and upon that speech of theirs was
   that renewal made, which is clear from Deuteronomy 18:17,18.

   [103] From the mercy-seat, which was within the tabernacle. The
   tabernacle was an eminent type of Christ, (Heb 9:11), as the temple
   also was, (John 2:19,21). So this represented God's speaking in a
   Mediator, in Jesus Christ. Here was a change agreeable to the people's
   desire on Mount Sinai. God speaks, not from a burning mountain as
   before, but out of the tabernacle: nor with terrible thunderings as at
   Sinai, but in a still small voice, intimated to us, and intimated by
   the extraordinary smallness of one letter in the original word rendered
   called, as the Hebrew doctors do account for that irregularity of
   writing in that word.

   [104] Moses exceedingly feared and quaked, (Heb 22:21), while he stood
   amongst the rest of the Israelites at Mount Sinai during the giving of
   the law, (Exo 19:25, 20:21). But here he is represented as Israel's
   federal head in this covenant, he being the typical mediator; which
   plainly intimated the covenant of grace to have been made with Christ,
   and with him in all the elect: "I have made a covenant with thee and
   with Israel," says the text.--See the first note on the preface, in the
   Larger Catechism, quest. 31.

   [105] Moses was twice on the Mount with God forty days. In the time of
   the second forty days he received the order to write, mentioned Exodus
   34:27, as appears by comparing verse 27 with 28. This comprehended his
   writings of the Levitical laws, but not of the decalogue or ten
   commandments; for these last, God himself wrote on tables of stone,
   verse 28 compared with verse 1. This peremptory divine order, Moses, no
   doubt, did obey; understanding it of writing in a book, since he was
   not commanded to write another way. So, in a like case, before he went
   up into the Mount for the first forty days, he wrote Levitical laws in
   a book called the Book of the Covenant, (Exo 24:4,7), "And Moses wrote
   all the words of the Lord. And he took the book of the covenant and
   read." Compare verse 18. This writing also comprehended Levitical laws,
   but not the ten commandments. For all the words of the Lord which Moses
   wrote, were all the words of the Lord which Moses told the people. And
   what these were, appears from his commission received for that effect:
   (20:21,22), "And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto
   the thick darkness where God was; and the Lord said unto Moses, Thus
   thou shalt say unto the children of Israel," &c. So "all the words"
   were these which follow to the end of the 23rd chapter.

   [106] In the original text, (verse 5) they are called emphatically the
   young men [or ministers, or servants, (1 Sam 2:13,15, Esth 2:2)] of the
   children of Israel, to signify that they were first-born. And so
   Onkelos reads it, "the first-born of the children of Israel."

   [107] The blood of the sacrifice representing the precious blood of
   Christ.

   [108] The church was in her minority under the law, (Gal 4:1-3).

   [109] From the death he had deserved by his sin.

   [110] Typically.

   [111] "The mystical signification of the sacrifices, and especially
   this rite, some think the apostle means by the doctrine of 'laying on
   of hands,' (Heb 6:2), which typified evangelical faith." Henry on
   Leviticus 1:4. It is evident that the offerer, by laying his hand on
   the head of the sacrifice, did legally unite with it; laid his sin, or
   transferred his guilt upon it, in a typical or ceremonial way., (Lev
   16:21); the substance and truth of which ceremonial action plainly
   appears to be faith, or believing on Jesus Christ, which is the soul's
   assenting, for its own part, to, and acquiescing in the glorious device
   of, "the Lord's laying on him the iniquities of us all," (Isa 53:6).

   [112] That is, they saw themselves, as in themselves condemned by the
   holy law.

   [113] That is, as an absolute God out of Christ, but always as a God in
   Christ.

   [114] To Christ, by faith.

   [115] It stood, at first, on man's own obedience: which ground quickly
   failed: then, it came to Christ, where it stood firm, (Gen 3:15). It
   [namely, "the seed of the woman"] "shall bruise thy head," viz: the
   serpent's head.

   [116] "Faith presenting to his view at all times the great angel of the
   covenant, God the Son, the Redeemer of him and Israel." Suppl. Poole's
   Annot. on the Text.

   [117] "Christ--being put to death in the flesh," (1 Peter 3:18).

   [118] Chiefly; in so far as, in that dispensation of the covenant of
   grace, the promises of earthly blessings were chiefly insisted on; and
   the promises of spiritual blessings and salvation more sparingly.

   [119] "There are not, therefore, two covenants of grace, differing in
   substance; but one and the same under various dispensations." Westm.
   Confess. chap. 7, art. 6. And their covenant of grace, confirmed by the
   sprinkling of blood, (Exo 24, Heb 9:19,20) [the which covenant they
   brake, by their unbelief frustrating the manner in which it was
   administered to them,] was given to them when the Lord had led them out
   of Egypt, and at Sinai too, as well as the ten commandments delivered
   to them as the covenant of works. This is evident from Exodus 20:1-17,
   compared with Deuteronomy 5:2-22, and Exodus 20:20,21, compared with
   chapter 24:3-8.

   [120] Not in a strict and proper sense, as that, upon the performance
   of which the right and title to the benefits of the covenant are
   founded and pleaded; as perfect obedience was the condition of the
   covenant of works. Christ's fulfilling of the law, by his obedience and
   death, is the only condition of the covenant of grace, in that sense.
   But in a large and improper sense, as that whereby one accepts and
   embraces the covenant and the proper condition thereof, and is savingly
   interested in Jesus Christ, the head of the covenant. "The grace of God
   is manifested in the second covenant, in that he freely provideth and
   offereth to sinners a Mediator, and life and salvation by him; and
   requiring faith as the condition to interest them in him," &c. Lar.
   Cat. quest. 32.

   [121] That is a type, he being to them a typical Mediator.

   [122] The obedience of the believing Jews.

   [123] That is, in the sense of our author, not as the covenant of
   works, but of the twofold notion or consideration under which the ten
   commandments were delivered from Mount Sinai.

   [124] From an atoned God in Christ, binding them to obedience with the
   strongest ties, arising from their creation and redemption jointly; but
   not with the bond of the curse, binding them over to eternal death in
   case of transgression, as the law or covenant of works does with them
   who are under it, (Gal 3:10). The mercy-seat was the cover of the ark,
   and both the one and the other type of Christ. Within the ark, under
   the cover of it, were the tables of the law laid up. Thus was the
   throne of grace, which could not have stood on mere mercy, firmly
   established in Jesus Christ; according to Psalm 89:14, "Justice and
   judgment are the habitation [marg. 'establishment'] of thy throne." The
   word properly signifies a base, supporter, stay, or foundation, on
   which a thing stands firm, (Ezra 2:68, 3:3, Psa 104:5). The sense is, O
   God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, (Psa 89:19), justice
   satisfied, and judgment fully executed in the person of the Mediator,
   are the foundation and base which thy throne of grace stands upon.

   [125] Namely, the promissory and penal sanction of eternal life and
   death, in which God's truth was engaged.

   [126] Man's part was his consenting to the terms set before him by his
   Creator.

   [127] That is, to bring us unto Christ, as we read it with the
   supplement.

   [128] As the covenant of works; so the author uses that term here, as
   it is used, Larg. Cat. quest. 93, above cited.

   [129] Broken under the sense of guilt, the curse of the law, and their
   utter inability to help themselves by doing or suffering.

   [130] Christ's satisfying the law for sinners by his obedience and
   death, being the great lesson taught by the ceremonial law, which was
   the gospel written in plain characters, to those whose eyes were
   opened.

   [131] Appropriating and applying to themselves by faith Christ's
   satisfaction held forth and exhibited to them in these divine
   ordinances.

   [132] Both in time and eternity.

   [133] Which were of that nation, according to Genesis 21:12, "In Isaac
   shall thy seed be called." And chapter 28:13, "I am the Lord God of
   Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac; the land whereon thou liest,
   to thee will I give it, and to thy seed."

   [134] The author does not make the covenant at Horeb distinct from that
   at Sinai; for he takes Horeb and Sinai for one and the same mountain,
   according to the holy Scriptures, (Exodus 19:20, compared with
   Deuteronomy 5:2), and therefore, because the text speaks of this
   covenant in the land of Moab as another

   [135] This is not to be understood strictly of the very moment of man's
   creation, in which the natural law was impressed on his heart, but with
   some latitude, the covenant of works being made with man newly created;
   and so divines call it the covenant of nature. See Dickson's Therap.
   Sacr., book 1, chap. 5, p. 116.

   [136] This is not to insinuate, that Luther had arrived but to a small
   measure of the knowledge of the doctrine of justification and
   acceptation of a sinner before God, in comparison with those of later
   times; I make no question but he understood that doctrine as well as
   any man has done since; and doubt not but our author was of the same
   mind anent him: but it is to show, that that great man of God, and
   others who went before him, found their way out of the midnight
   darkness of Popery in that point, with less means of light by far than
   men now have, who notwithstanding cannot hold off from it.

   [137] By which means they put their own works in the room of Christ,
   "who of God is made unto us--righteousness and sanctification," (1 Cor
   1:30). According to the Scripture plan of justification and
   sanctification, a sinner is justified by his blood, (Rom 5:9),
   sanctified in Christ Jesus, (1 Cor 1:2), through sanctification of the
   Spirit, (2 Thess 2:13), sanctified by faith, (Acts 26:18).

   [138] It is indeed the practice of every unregenerate man, whatever be
   his knowledge or professed principles; for the contrary practice is the
   practice of the saints, and of them only, (Matt 5:3), "Blessed are the
   poor in spirit."--(Phil 3:3), "We are the circumcision, which worship
   God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence
   in the flesh."

   [139] For these flow from our building so much on something in
   ourselves, which is always very variable; and so little on the "grace
   that is in Christ Jesus," (2 Tim 2:1), which is an immovable
   foundation.

   [140] It is not necessary, for saving this account of Nomista's case
   from the odious charge of forgery, that the particulars therein
   mentioned should have been real facts; more than [not to speak of
   Scripture parables] it is necessary to save the whole book from the
   same imputation, that the speeches therein contained should have
   passed, at a certain time, in a real conference of four men, called
   Evangelista, Nomista, Antinomista, and Neophytus; yet I make no
   question but it is grounded on matters of fact, falling out by some
   casuist's inadvertency, excess of charity to, or shifting converse
   with, the afflicted, as to their soul exercise, or by means of corrupt
   principles. And as the former are incident to good men of sound
   principles at any time, which calls ministers on such occasions to take
   heed to the frame of their own spirits, and to be much in the exercise
   of dependence on the Lord, lest they do hurt to souls instead of doing
   them good; so the latter is at no time to be thought strange, since
   there were found, even in the primitive apostolical churches, some who
   were reputed godly, zealous gospel ministers, especially by such as had
   little savour of Christ on their own souls, who nevertheless, in their
   zeal for the law, perverted the gospel of Christ, (Gal 1:6,7, 4:17).
   Whether Nomista was of opinion that the covenant of works was still in
   force or not, our Lord Jesus Christ taught that it was, (Luke
   10:25-28); and so does the apostle, (Gal 3:10); and unbelievers will
   find it so to their everlasting ruin. For, "our Lord Jesus, who now
   offers to be Mediator for them who believe on him, shall, at the last
   day, come armed with flaming fire, to judge, condemn, and destroy all
   them who have not believed God, have not received the offer of grace
   made in the gospel, nor obeyed the doctrine thereof, but remain in
   their natural state, under the law or covenant of works."--Practical
   Use of Saving Knowledge, tit. For convincing a man of Judgment by the
   Law, part 2.

   [141] For in that case the obedience both of the one and of the other
   is imperfect, and so is not conform to the law; therefore it can in no
   wise be accepted for righteousness; but according to justice proceeding
   upon it, the soul that hath it must die, because a sinful soul, (Eze
   18:4).

   [142] (Eph 4:20,21), "But ye have not so learned Christ; if so be that
   ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in
   Jesus."

   [143] What this is, in the sense of the speaker, he himself immediately
   explains at large. In a word, in his sense, it is to be an Antinomian
   indeed. The sum of his compliment made to Evangelista, or the author,
   which you please, lies here; namely, that he had left off hearing him,
   because he did not preach the gospel, so purely as some others in the
   place; yet in his opinion, he understood it better than many others;
   and [to carry the compliment to the highest pitch] it was by his means
   he turned downright Antinomian. One would think, that whatever was the
   measure of the author's pride or humility, self- denial or
   self-seeking, he had as much common sense as would render this address
   not very taking with him, or at least would teach him, that the
   publishing of it was none of the most proper means for commending of
   himself. So that the publishing of it may rather be imputed to the
   author's self-denial than to the want thereof; though I presume the
   considering reader will neither impute it to the one nor to the other.

   [144] The preacher taught, according to his text, That man's own
   righteousness had no hand in his justification and salvation; he
   dehorted, from putting confidence in good works; and exhorted, by faith
   to lay hold on Christ's righteousness only. And this hearer thence
   inferred, that there was no need at all of good works; as if one should
   conclude, that because it is the eye only that seeth, therefore there
   is no need at all of hand or foot. So the apostle Paul's doctrine was
   misconstrued; (Rom 3:8), "Some affirm that we say, Let us do evil that
   good may come." Yea, in the apostles' days, the doctrine of free grace
   was actually thus abused to Antinomianism, by some "turning the grace
   of God into lasciviousness," (Jude 4). The apostle was aware of the
   danger on that side, through the corruption of the hearts of men; (Gal
   5:13), "Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not
   liberty for an occasion to the flesh." And ministers of Christ, [who
   himself was accounted "a friend to publicans and sinners," &c., (Matt
   11:19),] followers of Paul's doctrine, which, in the eyes of carnal
   men, had a show and semblance of favouring sinful liberty, ought to set
   the apostles' example in this matter before them in a special manner;
   with fear and trembling, keeping a jealous eye on the danger from that
   part; especially in this day, wherein the Lord's indignation is visibly
   going out in spiritual strokes, for a despised gospel; knowing that the
   gospel of Christ is to some "the savour of death unto death," (2 Cor
   2:16), and that "there are who wrest the Scriptures [themselves] unto
   their own destruction," (2 Peter 2:17).

   [145] How easy is the passage from legalism to Antinomianism! Had this
   poor man, under his trouble and disquiet of conscience, fled to Jesus
   Christ for the purging of his conscience from guilt by his blood, and
   the sanctifying of his nature by his Spirit; and not put his own
   confessions of sins, prayers for pardon, and promises of amendment, in
   the room of Christ's atoning blood; and his blind and faithless
   resolutions to amend, in the room of the sanctifying spirit of Christ;
   he had escaped this snare of the devil (Heb 9:14, Rom 7:4- 6).

   [146] This doctrine of our author is far from cherishing of
   presumption, or opening of a gap to licentiousness.

   [147] That is, to scale and get into it by their own good works.

   [148] The offences of these men here taxed, were both against the law
   [or covenant] of works; for they must needs have been against that law
   which they were under, and not another; and both of them were as yet
   under the law, or covenant of works, as being both unbelievers, the
   which was told to Antinomista, as it was to Nomista; wherefore it is
   manifest, that by the matter of the law here, is not meant the law of
   Christ, but the matter of the law of works, that is, the ten
   commandments, as they stand in the covenant of works, which Antinomista
   had no regard to in his conversation, though they had all the authority
   and binding force upon him found in the covenant. And as he offended
   against the matter of it, so did Nomista against the form, in seeking
   to be justified by his obedience; for the covenant of works never bound
   a sinner to seek to be justified by his obedience to it; but, on the
   contrary, always condemned that as presumption, staking down the guilty
   under the curse, without remedy, till satisfaction be made by another
   hand.

   [149] This comparison is not stated betwixt these two, considered,
   simply, as to their different manner of life; but in point of
   pliableness to receive conviction, wherein the latter hath the
   advantage of the former; which the Scripture oftener than once takes
   notice of, (Matt 21:31), quoted in the following sentence, "I would
   thou wert cold or hot," (Rev 3:15). The passage is to be found in his
   Sermon upon the Hymn of Zacharias, page 50.

   [150] That is, you are not only unable to do enough, but also, that you
   are not able to do anything. "Not that we are sufficient of ourselves
   to think anything as of ourselves," (2 Cor 3:5).

   [151] That is, all those who have, or shall believe, or all the elect,
   which is one and the same in reality, and in the judgment of our
   author, expressly declared in the first sentence of his preface.

   [152] By imputation and law-reckoning; no otherwise, as a sinner
   believing in him is righteous before God. [Thus Isaac Ambrose, speaking
   of justification, says, "This righteousness makes a sinner sinless";
   i.e., as to guilt.] This must be owned to be the meaning of this
   expression, unless one will shut one's eyes to the immediately
   foregoing and following words,--I find him a sinner, said the law; such
   an one as hath taken sin upon him. They are the words of Luther, and he
   was not the first who spoke so. "He made him who was righteous to be
   made a sinner, that he might make sinners righteous," says Chrysostom,
   on 2 Cor. 5. Hom. 11. cit. Owen on Justification, p. 39. Famous
   Protestant divines have also used the expression after him. "When our
   divines," says Rutherford, "say, Christ took our place, and we have his
   condition,--Christ was made us, and made the sinner; it is true, only
   in a legal sense. He [Christ] was debitor factus,--a sinner; a debtor
   by imputation, a debtor by law, by place, by office." Trial and Triumph
   of Faith, p. 245, 257. Charnock argues the point thus: "How could he
   die, if he were not a reputed sinner? Had he not first had a relation
   to our sin, he could not in justice have undergone our punishment. He
   must, in the order of justice, be supposed a sinner really, or by
   imputation. Really, he was not; by imputation then he was," vol. 2. p.
   547. Serm. on 1 Cor. 5:7. "Though personally he was no sinner, yet by
   imputation he was," says the Contin. of Poole's Annot. on 2 Cor. 5:21.
   "What Illyricus wrote," says Rivet, "that Christ might most truly be
   called a sinner, Bellarmine calls blasphemy and cursed impudence. Now
   Bellarmine himself contends, that Christ might attribute our sins to
   himself, therefore he might also truly call himself a sinner, while in
   himself innocent, he did represent our person. What blasphemy, what
   impiety is here?" Comment. on Psalm 21:1. The Scripture phrase to this
   purpose is more forcible; (2 Cor 5:21), "For he hath made him to be sin
   for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God
   in him." For as it is more to say we are made righteousness, than to
   say we are made righteous, since the former plainly imports a
   perfection of righteousness, if I may be allowed the phrase,
   righteousness not being properly capable of degrees; so it is more to
   say, Christ was made sin for the elect world, than to say he was made a
   sinner, since the first of these doth accordingly point at the
   universality and complete tale of the elect's sins, from the first to
   the last of them laid on our spotless Redeemer. Compare Leviticus
   16:21,22, "And Aaron shall confess over him [viz: the scape-goat, which
   the apostle hath an eye to here] all the iniquities of the children of
   Israel, and all their transgressions, and all their sins, putting them
   upon the head of the goat. And the goat shall bear upon him all their
   iniquities," (Isa 53:6). "And the Lord [marg.] hath made the iniquity
   of us all to meet on [Heb. in] him." These two texts give the just
   notion of the true import of that phrase, "He was made sin for us."

   [153] Our Lord Jesus Christ died not for, nor took upon him the sins
   of, all and every individual man, but he died for, and took upon him
   the sins of, all the elect, (John 10:15, 15:13, Acts 20:28, Eph 5:25,
   Titus 2:14), and no other doctrine is here taught by our author
   touching the extent of the death of Christ. In the preceding paragraph,
   where was the proper place for giving his judgment on that head, he
   purposely declares it. He had before taught, that Jesus Christ did from
   eternity become man's surety in the covenant that passed betwixt him
   and the Father. A surety puts himself in the place of those for whom he
   becomes a surety, to pay their debt, (Gen 44:32,33, Prov 22:26,27). And
   our author tells us, that now, when the prefixed time of Christ's
   fulfilling the eternal covenant, paying the debt he had taken on him,
   and purchasing man's redemption by his sufferings, was come, he did,
   according to the tenor of that covenant, which stated the extent of his
   suretyship, put himself in the room and place--he says not, of all men,
   but--of all the faithful, or elect of God; Jesus Christ thus standing
   in their room and place, actually to take on the burden. "The Lord laid
   on him the iniquities of us all"; the which Scripture text can bear no
   other sense in the connection of it here, that what is the genuine
   sense of it, as it stands in the holy Scripture, namely, that the
   Father laid on Christ the iniquities of all the spiritual Israel of
   God, of all nations, ranks, and conditions; for no iniquities could be
   laid on him but theirs in whose room and place he put himself to
   receive the burden, according to the eternal and mutual agreement.
   These iniquities being thus laid on the Mediator, the law came and
   said, I find him such an one as hath taken on him the sins of all men.
   This is but an incident expression on the head of the extent of
   Christ's death, and it is a scriptural one too. (1 Tim 2:6), "Who gave
   himself a ransom for all," i.e., for all sorts of men, not for all of
   every sort. (Heb 2:9), "That he, by the grace of God, should taste
   death for every man," i.e., for every man of those whom the apostle is
   there treating of, namely, sons brought or to be brought unto glory,
   (verse 10); those who are sanctified, Christ's brethren, (verse 11);
   given to him, (verse 13); and the sense of the phrase, as used here by
   the author, can be no other; for the sins, which the law found that he
   had taken on him, could be no other but the sins that the Lord had laid
   on him; and the sins the Lord had laid on him were the sins of all the
   faithful or elect, according to the author; wherefore, in the author's
   sense, the sins of all men which the law found in Christ were the sins
   of all the elect, according to the genuine sense of the Scripture
   phraseology on that head. And an incident expression, in words which
   the Holy Ghost teacheth, and determined in its connection to the
   orthodox scriptural meaning, can never import any prejudice to his
   sentiment upon that point purposely declared before in its proper
   place. It is true, the author, when speaking of those in whose room
   Christ put himself, useth not the word alone; and in the holy Scripture
   it is not used neither on that subject. And it may be observed, that
   the Spirit of God in the word, doth not open the doctrine of election
   and reprobation, but upon man's rejecting or embracing the gospel
   offer; the which different events are then seasonably accounted for,
   from the depths of the eternal counsel of God. See Luke 10:17-22,
   Matthew 22:1- 14, Romans 9 throughout; Ephesians 1:3-5. To every thing
   there is a season. The author hitherto hath been dealing with the
   parties, to bring them to Christ; and particularly here, he is speaking
   for the instruction and direction of a convinced trembling sinner,
   namely, Neophytus; and, therefore, like a wise and tender man in such a
   case, he useth a manner of speaking, which being warranted by the word,
   was fitted to excite the awakening of the ordinary scruples in that
   case, namely, "It may be I am not elected,--it may be Christ died not
   for me"; and which pointed at the duty of all, and the encouragement
   that all have to come to Christ. And all this, after he had in his very
   first words to the reader, sufficiently provided for his using such a
   manner of expression, without prejudice to the truth. further, the law
   adds, "Therefore let him die upon the cross." Wherefore? For their
   sins, of the laying of which upon him there is no mention made? or for
   the sins of those in whose room he is expressly said to have put
   himself, accoding to the eternal agreemtn betwixt the Father and him?
   Then said Christ, "Lo! I com"; viz: actually to pay the debt for which
   I have become surety in the eternal compact; the which, whose it was,
   acccording to our author, is already sufficiently declared. The law
   then set upon him, and killed him; for whom, according to our author?
   For these, surely, in whose room and place he put himself, and so
   stood. If one considers his account of the effect of all this, one does
   not find it to be, as Arminians say, "tath Christ, by the merit of his
   detah, hath so far forth reconciled God the Father to all mankind, that
   the Father, by reason of the Son's merit, both could and would, and did
   enter and establish a new and gracious covenant with sinful man, liable
   to condmenation." [Examination of Tilenus, p. 164, art. 2, sect 2.]
   "and obtained for all and every man a restoration into a sttate of
   grace and salvation; so that none will be condemened, nor are liable to
   condmenation for original sin, but all are free from the guilt of that
   sin." [Teste. Turret. loc. 14. ques. 14. th. 5.] Neither does he tell
   us, that Christ died to "render sin remissible to all persons, and them
   savalbe," as the Continuator of Poole's Annotations on Hebrews, chapter
   2:9, says, with other Universalists. By this means, says our author,
   "was the justice of God fully satisfied, his wrath appeased, and all
   true believers acquitted." Compare Westm. Confess. chap. 8. art. 4, 5.
   "This office [viz: of a surety] the Lord Jesus did most willingly
   undertake, which that he might discharge, he was made under the law,
   and did perfectly fulfil it, endured most grievous torments, &c. The
   Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience, and sactifice of himself--hath
   fully satisfied the justice of his Father; and purchased, not only
   reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of
   heaven, for all those whom the Father hath given unto him. Christ, by
   his obedience and deth, did fully discharge the debt of all those that
   are thus justified," Chap. 11, art. 3. Wherefore the author does not
   here teach an universal redemption or atonement. Of this more
   afterward.

   [154] Pardon is the removing of the guilt of sin. Guilt is twofold: 1.
   The guilt of eternal wrath, by which the sinner is bound over to the
   eternal revenging wrath of God; and this, by orthodox divines, is
   called the guilt of sin by way of eminency. 2. The guilt of fatherly
   anger, whereby the sinner is bound over to God's fatherly anger and
   chastisements for sin. Accordingly, there is a two-fold pardon: the one
   is the removal of the guilt of eternal wrath, and is called legal
   pardon; the other the removal of the guilt of fatherly anger, and is
   called gospel pardon. As to the latter, the believer is daily to sue
   out his pardon, since he is daily contracting new guilt of that kind;
   and this the author plainly teaches afterwards in its proper place. As
   to the former, of which only he speaks here, all the sins of a
   believer, past, present, and to come, are pardoned together, and at
   once, in the first instance of his believing; that is to say, the guilt
   of eternal wrath for sin then past and present is actually and formally
   done away; the obligation to that wrath which he was lying under for
   these sins is dissolved, and the guilt of eternal wrath for sins then
   to come is effectually prevented from that moment for ever, so that he
   can never come under that kind of guilt any more; and this pardon, as
   it relates to these sins, is but a pardon improperly so called, being
   rather a not imputing of them, than a formal remission, forasmuch as a
   formal remission being a dissolution of guilt actually contracted,
   agrees only to sins already committed. Therefore our author here uses
   the word acquitted, which is of a more extensive signification. All
   pardon of sin is an acquittance, but all acquittance of sin is not a
   formal pardon of it: "For at the resurrection, believers being raised
   up in glory, shall be openly acknowledged and acquitted in the day of
   judgment." Short. Cat. But they will not then be formally pardoned.
   Now, this is the doctrine of the holy Scriptures, (Rom 4:48), "Even as
   David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth
   righteousness without works, saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities
   are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom
   the Lord WILL NOT IMPUTE sin."--(7:1), "There is therefore now no
   condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." That is, not only they
   shall never be actually damned, i.e., sent to hell, as that phrase is
   ordinarily taken, for that is the privilege of all the elect, even
   before they believe, while yet they are under condemnation according to
   the Scripture; but there is no binding over of them that are in Christ
   to eternal wrath, no guilt to that kind to them. Compare John 3:18, "He
   that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is
   condemned already."--"The one [viz: justification] doth equally free
   all believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in
   this life, that they never fall into condemnation." Larg. Cat. quest.

   [155] "What things soever it saith, it saith to them who are under it,"
   (Rom 3:19). But believers are not under it, nor under the law of the
   covenant of works, (6:14), therefore it saith nothing to them. As such,
   it said all to Christ in their room and place; and, without the
   Mediator's dishonour, it cannot repeat its demands on them which it
   made upon him as their surety. Meanwhile the law, as a rule of life to
   believers, saith to them all, in the name and authority of God, the
   Creator and Redeemer, (Matt 5:48), "Be ye therefore perfect, even as
   your Father which is in heaven is perfect." Howbeit, they are under a
   covenant, under which, though no less is required, yet less is
   accepted, for the sake of Christ their covenant head.

   [156] Namely, in the sense of the law; for in the law-reckoning, as to
   the payment of a debt, and fulfilling of a covenant, or any the like
   purposes, the surety and the original debtor, the federal head or the
   representative, and the represented, are but one person. And thus the
   Scripture determining Adam to be the figure [or type] of Christ, (Rom
   5:14), teaches upon the one hand, that all mankind sinned in Adam,
   (verse 12), and died in him, (1 Cor 15:22); and on the other hand, that
   believers were crucified with Christ, (Gal 2:20), and raised up in him.
   (Eph 2:6) "The covenant [of works] being made with Adam as a public
   person--all mankind--sinned in him." Lar. Cat. Quest. 22. "The covenant
   of grace was made with Christ as the second Adam," Quest. 31. "He
   satisfied divine justice, the which he did as a public person, the head
   of his Church," Quest. 52. "that the righteousness of the law," says
   the apostle, "might be fulfilled in us," (Rom 8:4); so believers
   satisfied in him, as they sinned in Adam. "The threatening of death,
   (Gen 2:17), is fulfilled in the elect so that they die, and yet their
   lives are spared: they die, and yet they live, for they are reckoned in
   law to have died when Christ their surety died for them." Ferguson on
   Galatians 2:20. "Although thou," says Beza, "hast satisfied for the
   pain of thy sins in the person of Jesus Christ," Beza's Confess. point
   4, art. 12. "What challenges Satan or conscience can make against the
   believer--hear an answer; I was condemned, I was judged, I was
   crucified for sin, when my surety Christ was condemned, judged, and
   crucified for my sins.--I have paid all, because my surety has paid
   all," Rutherford's Trial and Triumph of Faith, serm. 19, p. 258. "As in
   Christ, we satisfied, so likewise in Adam we sinned," Flint. Exam. p.
   144. This doctrine, and the doctrine of the formal imputation of
   Christ's righteousness to believers stand and fall together. For if
   believers be reckoned in law to have satisfied in Christ, then his
   righteousness, which is the result of his satisfaction, must needs be
   accounted theirs, but if there be no such law-reckoning, Christ's
   righteousness cannot be imputed to them otherwise than as to the
   effects of it, for the judgment of God is always according to truth,
   (Rom 2:2). This the Neonomians are aware of, and deny both, reckoning
   them Antinomian principles as they do many other Protestant doctrines.
   Hear Mr. Gibbons: "They [viz: the Antinomians] are dangerously mistaken
   in thinking that a believer is righteous in the sight of God, with the
   self-same active and passive righteousness wherewith Christ was
   righteous, as though believers suffered in Christ, and obeyed in
   Christ." Morn. Exer. Method. sec. 19, p. 423. On the other hand, the
   Westminster divines teach both as sound and orthodox principles,
   affirming Christ's righteousness, obedience, and satisfaction,
   themselves to be imputed to believers, or reckoned their righteousness,
   obedience, and satisfaction. "Justification is an act of God's free
   grace, wherein he pardoneth all our sins, and accepteth us as righteous
   in his sight, only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to us."

   Christ by God imputed to them," Large. Cat. quest. 70.--"By imputing
   the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them," Westm. Confess.

   [157] Virtually justified, not actually, in his justification, even as
   in his resurrection they did virtually arise. That this is the author's
   meaning is evident from his own words, when speaking of Neophytus, he
   says expressly, "He was justified meritoriously in the death and
   resurrection of Christ, but yet he was not justified actually, till he
   did actually believe in Christ."

   [158] So called to distinguish it from inherent righteousness, which is
   righteousness from life.

   [159] This is a weighty point, the plain and native result of what is
   said, namely, that since Jesus Christ hath fully accomplished what was
   to have been done by man himself for life according to the covenant of
   works, and that the same is imputed to believers; therefore, believers
   are in the same state, as to righteousness unto life, that they would
   have been in if man himself had stood the whole time appointed for his
   trial. And here is the true ground in the law of the infallible
   perseverance of the saints; their time of trial for life is over in
   their Head the second Adam--the prize is won! Hence the just by faith
   are entitled to the same benefit which Adam by his perfect obedience
   would have been entitled to. Compare Romans 10:5, "The man which doeth
   these things shall live," with Habakkuk 2:4, "The just by his faith
   shall live"; the which is the true reading according to the original.
   And here, for clearing of the following purpose of the believer's
   freedom from the law, as it is the covenant of works, let it be
   considered, that if Adam had stood till the time of his trial had been
   expired, the covenant of works would indeed from that time have
   remained his everlasting security for eternal life, like a contract
   held fulfilled by the one party; but, as in the same case, it could
   have no longer remained to be the rule of his obedience, namely, in the
   state of confirmation. The reason is obvious, viz: that the subjecting
   of him still to the covenant of works, as the rule of his obedience,
   would have been a reducing him to the state of trial he was in before,
   and the setting him anew to work for what was already his own, in
   virtue of his [supposed] fulfilling of that covenant. Nevertheless it
   is absolutely impossible but the creature, in any state whatsoever,
   must be bound to and owe obedience unto the Creator; and being still
   bound to obedience, of necessity he behoved to have had a rule of that
   obedience; as to which rule, since the covenant of works could not be
   it, what remains but that the rule of obedience in the state of
   confirmation, would have been the law of nature, suited to man's state
   of immutability, improperly so called, and so divested of the form of
   the covenant of works, namely, its promise of eternal life, and
   threatening of eternal death, as it is, and will be in heaven, for
   ever? The application is easy, making always, as to the rule of
   believers' obedience, suitable reserves for the imperfection of their
   state, in respect of inherent righteousness; the which imperfection, as
   it leaves room for promises of fatherly smiles, and threatenings of
   fatherly chastisements, so it makes them necessary; but these also
   shall be done away in heaven when their real estate shall be perfect,
   as their relative state is now.

   [160] (Rom 7:4), "Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to
   the law."--(Gal 2:19), "I through the law am dead to the law." And
   this, according to the nature of correlates, concludes the law, as it
   is that covenant of works, to be dead also to believers. (Col 2:14),
   "Nailing it to his cross."

   [161] This is cited from Luther on the Epistle to the Galatians,
   according to the English translation, and is to be found there, fol.
   184, p. 1, 2, fol. 185. p. 1, fol. 82, p. 1. His own words from the
   Latin original, after he had lectured that epistle a second time, as I
   find them in my copy, printed at Frankfort, 1563, are here subjoined.
   "Hoc profecto mirabile duellum est, ubi, lex, creatura cum Creatore sic
   congreditur, et prater omne jus, omnem tyrannidem suam in Filio Dei
   exercet. quam in nobis filiis irae exercuit," Luth. Comment. in
   Galatians 4:5, p. 598. "Ideo lex, tanquam latro et sacrilegus homicida
   Filii Dei, amittit jus, et meretur damnari," Ibid. p. 600. "Ergo lex
   est mihi surda, ligata, mortua et crucifixa," Ibid. cap. 2:20, p. 280.
   "Conscientia apprehendens hoc apostoli verbum, Christus a lege nos
   redemit--sancta quadam superbia insultat legi, dicens--nunc in posterum
   non solum Christo victa et strangulata es, sed etiam mihi credenti in
   eum, cui donavit hanc victoriam," page 600. That great man of God, a
   third Elias, and a second Paul, [if I may venture the expression,]
   though he was no inspired teacher, was endued with a great measure of
   the spirit of them both, being raised up of God for the extraordinary
   work of the Reformation of religion from Popery, while all the world
   wondered after the Beast. The lively savour he had of the truths of the
   gospel in his own soul, and the fervour of his spirit in delivering
   them, did indeed carry him as far from the modern politeness of
   expression, as the admiration and affectation of this last are likely
   to carry us off from the former. What he designed by all this triumph
   of faith is summed up in a few words, immediately following these last
   cited: "This, the law, [viz: as it is the covenant of works,] is gone
   for ever as to us, providing we abide in Christ." This he chose to
   express in such figurative terms, that that great gospel truth might be
   the more impressed on his own heart, and the hearts of his scholars,
   being prompted thereto by his experience of the necessity, and withal
   of the difficulty of applying it by faith to his own case, in his
   frequent deep soul exercises and conflicts of conscience. "Therefore,"
   says he, "feeling thy terrors and threatenings, O law! I dip my
   conscience over head and ears, into the wounds, blood, death,
   resurrection, and victory of Christ; besides him I will see and hear
   nothing at all. This faith is our victory, whereby we overcome the
   terrors of the law, sin, death, and all evils, but not without a great
   conflict," Ibid. p. 597. And speaking on the same subject elsewhere, he
   has these remarkable words, "It is easy to speak these things, but
   happy he that could know them aright in the conflict of conscience."
   Comment. on Galatians 2:19, p. 259. Now, to turn outward the wrong side
   of the picture of his discourse, to make it false, horrid, profane, and
   blasphemous, is hard. At this rate, many Scripture texts must suffer,
   not to speak of approved human writers. I instance only that of Elias,
   (1 Kings 18:27), "He [Baal] is a god; either he is talking, or he is
   pursuing, or he is on a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must
   be awaked." Yet I compare not Luther's commentary to the inspired
   writing; only where the holy Scripture goes before, one would think he
   might be allowed to follow. Here is an irony, a rhetorical figure, and
   there is a prosopopeia, or feigning of a person, another rhetorical
   figure; and the learned and holy man tells us withal, that Paul used it
   before him on the same subject, representing the law "as a most potent
   personage, who condemned and killed Christ, whom he [having overcome
   death] did in the like manner conquer, condemn, and kill"; for which he
   cites Ephesians 2 and 4, epistles to the Romans, Corinthians,
   Colossians, p. 599. Now, albeit the law, as it is the covenant of
   works, not being a person indeed, but a most holy law of God, was
   incapable of real arraignment, sin, theft, or murder: yet one being
   allowed to speak figuratively of it, as such a person before mentioned;
   and finding the Spirit of God to teach that it was crucified, Jesus
   Christ "nailing it to his cross," (Col 2:14); what impiety--what
   blasphemy is there in assigning crimes to it for which it was
   crucified--crimes of the same nature with its crucifixion, that is, not
   really and literally so, but figuratively only? And the crucifying of a
   person, as it presupposeth his arraignment, accusation, and
   condemnation, so it implies his binding and death; all which the
   decency of the parable requires. And the same decency requiring the
   rhetorical feigning of crimes as the causes of that crucifixion, they
   could be no other but these that are assigned; forasmuch as Jesus
   Christ is here considered, not as a sinner by imputation, but as
   absolutely without guilt, though in the meantime the sins of all the
   elect were really imputed to him, the which in reality justified the
   holy law's procedure against him. Moreover, upon the crucifixion, it
   may be remembered how the apostle proves Christ to have been "made a
   curse for us"; for, says he, it is written, "Cursed is every one that
   hangeth on a tree," (Gal 3:13); the which if any should apply to the
   law, as the covenant of works, in a figurative manner, as its
   crucifixion must be understood, it could import no more by reason of
   the nature of the thing, than an utter abolition of it with respect to
   believers, which is a great gospel truth. And here one may call to mind
   the Scripture phrases, (Rom 7:5), "The motions of sins which were by
   the law";--(8:2), "The law of sin and death":--"The covenant of works,
   called the law of sin and death," Confess. p. 382, fig. 3; "The
   strength of sin is the law," (1 Cor 15:56). After all, for my part, I
   would neither use some of these expressions of Luther's, nor dare I so
   much as in my heart condemn them in him: the reason is one; because of
   the want of that measure of the influences of grace which I conceive he
   had when he uttered these words. And the same I would say of the
   several expressions of the great Rutherford, and of many eminent
   ministers, in their day signally countenanced of God in their
   administrations, Hear Luther himself, in his preface to that book, page
   [mihi] 10, "These our thoughts," says he, "on this epistle do come
   forth, not so much against those, [viz: the church's enemies,] as for
   the sake of our own, [viz: her friends,] who will either thank me for
   my diligence, or will pardon my weakness and rashness." It is a pity
   the just expectation of one, whose name will be in honour in the church
   of Christ, while the memory of the Reformation from Popery is kept up,
   should be frustrated.

   [162] The law of the ten commandments given to Adam, as the covenant of
   works, promised eternal life, upon condition of obedience, and
   threatened eternal death in case of disobedience; and this was it that
   made it the covenant of works. Now, this covenant frame of the law of
   the ten commandments being dissolved as to believers, it can no more
   promise nor threaten them at any rate. The Scripture indeed testifies,
   that "godliness hath the promise, not only of the life that now is, but
   also of that which is to come," (1 Tim 4:8), there being an infallible
   connection between godliness and the glorious life in heaven
   established by promise in the covenant of grace; but in the meantime,
   it is the obedience and satisfaction of Christ apprehended by faith,
   and not our godliness, that is the condition upon which that life is
   promised, and upon which a real Christian in a dying hour will venture
   to plead for a share in that life. It is likewise certain that not only
   are unbelievers, in virtue of the covenant of works which they remain
   under, liable to eternal death as the just reward of sin, but there is
   by that covenant a twofold connection established, the one betwixt a
   state of unbelief, unregeneracy, impenitency, and unholiness, and
   eternal death; the other, betwixt acts of disobedience and eternal
   death. The former is absolutely indissoluble, and cannot but eternally
   remain; so that whosoever are in that state of sin, while they are in
   it they must needs be in a state of death, bound over to the wrath of
   God by virtue of the threatening of the law; but then it is impossible
   that believers in Christ can be in that state of sin. So these and the
   like sentences, "He that believeth not shall be damned," (Mark
   16:16).--"Except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish," (Luke
   13:3).--"If ye live after the flesh ye shall die," (Rom 8:13); do
   indeed bind over unbelievers to eternal death; but they do no otherwise
   concern believers than as they set before them a certain connection of
   two events, neither of which can ever be found in their case; and yet
   the serious consideration of them is of great and manifold use to
   believers, as a serious view of every part of the covenant of works is,
   particularly to move them to grow up more and more into Christ, and to
   make their calling and election sure. As to the latter connection, viz:
   betwixt acts of disobedience and eternal death, it is dissoluble, and
   in the case of the believer, actually dissolved; so that none have
   warrant to say to a believer, If thou sin, thou shalt die eternally;
   forasmuch as the threatening of eternal death, as to the believer,
   being already satisfied in the satisfaction of Christ, by faith
   apprehended and imputed of God to him, it cannot be renewed on him,
   more than one debt can be twice charged, namely, for double payment.

   [163] But on the having, or wanting of a saving interest in Christ.

   [164] This is a full proof of the whole matter. For how can the law of
   the ten commandments promise eternal life, or threaten eternal death,
   upon condition of obedience or disobedience, to those who have already
   escaped eternal death, and obtained eternal life by faith in Christ?
   The words which the Holy Ghost teaches, are so far from restraining the
   notion of eternal life to glorification, and of eternal death to the
   misery of the damned in hell, that they declare the soul upon its union
   with Christ to be as really possessed of eternal life as the saints in
   heaven are; and without that state of union, to be as really under
   death, and the wrath of God, as the damned in hell are, though not in
   that measure. [The term "eternal death" is not, as far as I remember,
   used in Scripture.] And this agreeable to the nature of things; for as
   there is no medium betwixt life and death in a subject capable of
   either, so it is evident, the life communicated to the soul, in its
   union with Christ, the quickening Head, can never be extinguished for
   the ages of eternity, (John 14:19); and the sinner's death under the
   guilt and power of sin, is in its own nature eternal, and can never end
   but by a work of Almighty power, which raiseth the dead, and calleth
   things that are not, to be as if they were. (1 Thess 1:10), "Jesus
   which delivered us from the wrath to come."--(1 John 3:14), "We know
   that we have passed from death unto life."--(John 3:36), "He that
   believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not
   on the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on
   him."--(5:24), "He that believeth, hath everlasting life, and shall not
   come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life."--(6:47),
   "He that believeth on me hath everlasting life."-- (verse 54), "Whoso
   eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life."-- (1 John
   5:12,13), "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son
   of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe
   on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal
   life."--See Romans 8:1; John 3:16-18, and 17:3.

   [165] All the demands of the covenant of works on the elect world.

   [166] That he, taking on their nature, might answer the demands of the
   covenant of works for them, (Eph 1:4), "According as he has chosen us
   in him." We are said to be chosen in Christ, not that Christ is the
   cause of election, but that electing love, flowing immediately from God
   to all the objects of it, the Father did, in one and the same decree of
   election, choose the head and the members of the happy body; yet Christ
   the head first, [in order of nature,] then all those who make up his
   body, who were thereby given to him, to be redeemed and saved, by his
   obedience and death; the which, being by him accepted, he, as
   Elect-Mediator and Head of elect-men, had full power and furniture for
   the work made over to him. And thus may we conceive the second covenant
   to have been concluded, agreeably to the Scripture account of that
   mystery. This, the author says, was done thereupon, not upon the
   Father's being well pleased and fully satisfied, by virtue of the
   covenant made; the which is the effect of the covenant, whereas this is
   one of the transactions or parts of the covenant, as all the following
   words brought to illustrate it do plainly carry it; but upon God the
   Son being on the other side in making of the second covenant, the which
   is the principal purpose in this paragraph, the explication whereof was
   interrupted by the adding of a sentence concerning the execution and
   effect of the glorious contrivance. In making of the second covenant,
   the second person of the ever blessed Trinity, considered simply as
   such, is one of the parties. Thereupon, in the decree of election,
   designing, as is said, both head and members, he is chosen Mediator and
   Head of the election, to be their incarnate Redeemer; the which
   headship accepted, he, as Mediator and Head of the election, took upon
   him to be incarnate, and in their nature to satisfy the demands of the
   covenant of works for them, (Isa 42:1, Eph 1:4, Psa 40:6), Westm.
   Confess. Chap. 8, art. 1; "It pleased God in his eternal purpose, to
   choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, his only begotten Son, to be the
   Mediator between God and man--the Head and Saviour of his church--unto
   whom he did, from all eternity, give a people to be his seed, and to be
   by him in time redeemed," &c. Chap 3, art. 5; "Those of mankind that
   are predestinated unto life--God hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting
   glory, out of his mere free grace and love."

   [167] That is, the covenant of grace only, not the covenant of works.

   [168] Namely, for life and salvation; the same being already performed
   by Jesus Christ; he, having in the second covenant undertaken to
   satisfy all the demands of the covenant of works, did do all that was
   to be done or wrought for our life and salvation. And if it had not
   been so, life and salvation had remained eternally without our reach;
   for how is it possible we should perform, do, or work, until we get
   life and salvation? what condition or law are we fit for performing of,
   while we are dead, and not saved from, but lying under sin, the wrath
   and curse of God? See the following note.

   [169] Namely, all that was to be done for life and salvation. And
   neither repentance, nor sincere [imperfect] obedience, nay, nor yet
   believing itself, is of that sort: though all of these are
   indispensably necessary in subjects capable of them. This expression
   bears a kind of imitation, usual in conversation, and used by our
   blessed Saviour on this subject. (John 6:28,29), "Then said they unto
   him, What shall we do, that we might WORK the works of God? Jesus
   answered and said unto them, This is THE WORK of God, that ye believe."
   The design of it plainly is, to confront the humour that is naturally
   in all men, for doing and working for life and salvation, when once
   they begin to lay these things to heart; there is no more, says the
   author, for him to do, but only to know and believe that Christ hath
   DONE all for him; and therefore the expression is not to be strained
   besides its scope. However, this is true faith, according to the
   Scripture, whether all saving faith be such a knowledge and believing
   or not; and that knowledge and believing are capable of degrees of
   certainty, and may be mixed with doubting, without overturning the
   reality of them. (Isa 53:11), "By his knowledge shall my righteous
   Servant justify many."--(John 17:3), "This is eternal life, that they
   might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast
   sent."--(Gal 2:20), "I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved
   me, and gave himself for me."--(Rom 10:9), "If thou shalt believe in
   thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be
   saved." To believe that God hath raised him from the dead is to believe
   that he has perfected the work, and done all that was to be done for
   life and salvation to sinners: but is this enough to constitute saving
   faith? Surely it is not; for devils may believe that: therefore, it
   must be believed with particular application to oneself, intimated in
   the phrase, "believing in thine heart"; and this is what devils and
   reprobates never reach unto; howbeit these last may pretend to know and
   believe, that Christ is raised from the dead for them, and so hath done
   all for them, even as they also may pretend to receive and rest on him
   alone for salvation. But in all this, one who truly believes may yet
   have ground to say with tears, "Lord, I believe! help thou mine
   unbelief," (Mark 9:24). Nevertheless, under this covenant there is much
   to do; a law to be performed and obeyed, though not for life and
   salvation but from life and salvation received; even the law of the ten
   commandments in the full extent thereof, as the author doth at large
   expressly teach, in its proper place, in this and the second part. This
   is the good old way, [according to the Scriptures, (Acts 16:30,31, Matt
   11:28,29, Titus 2:11,12),] if the famous Mr. John Davidson understood
   the Protestant doctrine, "Q. Then the salvation of man," says he, "is
   so fully wrought and perfectly accomplished by Christ in his own
   person, that nothing is left to be done or wrought by us in our
   persons, to be any cause of the least part thereof? A. That is most
   certain." Mr. John Davidson's Catechism, Edin. edit. 1708, p. 15. "So
   we are perfectly saved by the works which Christ did for us in his own
   person, and no ways by the good works which he works in us, with and
   after faith. [Marg. Here is the main point and ground of our
   disagreement with the Papists.] Rests, then, anything for us to do
   after that we are perfectly justified in God's sight by faith in
   Christ? Disciple. Yes, very much; albeit no ways to merit salvation;
   but only to witness, by the effects of thankfulness, that we ARE truly
   SAVED." Ibid. p. 46,48,49.

   [170] See the two foregoing notes. And hear another passage from the
   same book whence this is taken, namely, the English translation of
   Luther's Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians, fol. 75: "Good
   works ought to be done; the example of Christ is to be followed--Well,
   all these things will I gladly do. What then followeth? Thou shalt then
   be saved, and obtain everlasting life. Nay, not so. I grant, indeed,
   that I ought to do good works, patiently to suffer troubles and
   afflictions, and to shed my blood also, if need be, for Christ's cause;
   but yet am I not justified, neither do I OBTAIN SALVATION THEREBY."

   [171] This is the style of the same Luther, who useth to distinguish
   betwixt active and passive righteousness, i.e., the righteousness of
   the law, and the righteousness of faith; agreeably to Romans 4:5: "But
   to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the
   ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."

   [172] The passage at more length is this: "The marriage is made up
   without all pomp and solemnity: that is to say, nothing at all comes
   between; no law nor work is here required. Here is nothing else but the
   Father promising, and I receiving; but these things without experience
   and practice, cannot be understood." Luther, ubi sup., fol. 194.

   [173] These words also are Luther's, in his argument on the Epistle to
   the Galatians, p. 24 of the Latin copy, and fol. 7 of the translation;
   but what our author reads, "Nothing of the law of works," is, in
   Luther's own words, "Nothing of the law, or of works"; the sense is the
   same. What concerns the assurance in the nature of faith, which these
   words seem to bear, we will meet with anon.

   [174] In this definition of saving faith, there is the general nature
   or kind of it, viz: a real persuasion, agreeing to all sorts of faith,
   divine and human,--"Be verily persuaded"; the more special nature of
   it, an appropriating persuasion, or special application to oneself,
   agreeing to a convinced sinner's faith or belief of the law's curse,
   (Gal 3:10), as well as to it.--"Be verily persuaded in your hearts";
   thus, (Rom 10:9), "If thou shalt believe in thine heart that God, &c.
   thou shalt be saved": and, finally, the most special nature of it,
   whereby it is distinguished from all other, namely, an appropriating
   persuasion of Christ being yours, &c. And as one's believing in one's
   heart, or appropriating persuasion of the dreadful tidings of the law,
   imports not only an assent to them as true, but a horror of them as
   evil; so believing in the heart, or an appropriating persuasion of the
   glad tidings of the gospel, bears not only an assent to them as true,
   but a relish of them as good.
   The parts of this appropriating persuasion, according to our author,
   are, 1. "That Jesus Christ is yours," viz: by the deed of gift and
   grant made to mankind lost, or [which is the same thing in other words]
   by the authentic gospel offer, in the Lord's own word; the which offer
   is the foundation of faith, and the ground and warrant of the
   ministerial offer, without which it could avail nothing. That this is
   the meaning, appears from the answer to the question immediately
   following, touching the warrant to believe. By this offer or deed of
   gift and grant, Christ is ours before we believe; not that we have a
   saving interest in him, or are in a state of grace, but that we have a
   common interest in him, and the common salvation, which fallen angels
   have not, (Jude 3); so that it is lawful and warrantable for us, not
   for them, to take possession of Christ and his salvation. Even as when
   one presents a piece of gold to a poor man saying, "Take it, it is
   yours"; the offer makes the piece really his in the sense and to the
   effect before declared; nevertheless, while the poor man does not
   accept or receive it; whether apprehending the offer too great to be
   real, or that he has no liking of the necessary consequents of the
   accepting; it is not his in possession, nor hath he the benefit of it;
   but, on the contrary, must starve for it all, and that so much the more
   miserably, that he hath slighted the offer and refused the gift. So
   this act of faith is nothing else but to "believe God," (1 John 5:10);
   "to believe the Son," (John 3:36); "to believe the report" concerning
   Christ, (Isa 53:1); or "to believe the gospel," (Mark 1:15); not as
   devils believe the same, knowing Christ to be Jesus, a Saviour, but not
   their Saviour, but with an appropriating persuasion, or special
   application believing him to be our Saviour. Now what this gospel
   report, record, or testimony of God, to be believed by all, is, the
   inspired penman expressly declares, "This is the record, that God hath
   given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son," (1 John 5:11).
   The giving here mentioned, is not giving in possession in greater or
   lesser measure, but giving by way of grant, whereupon one may take
   possession. And the party to whom, is not the election only, but
   mankind lost. For this record is the gospel, the foundation of faith,
   and warrant to all, to believe in the Son of God, and lay hold on
   eternal life in him; but that God hath given eternal life to the elect,
   can be no such foundation nor warrant: for that a gift is made to
   certain select men, can never be a foundation or warrant for all men to
   accept and take it. The great sin of unbelief lies in not believing
   this record or testimony, and so making God a liar: "He that believeth
   not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record that
   God gave of his Son. And this is the record," &c. (1 John 5:10,11). On
   the other hand, "He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his
   seal that God is true," (John 3:33). But the great sin of unbelief
   lies, not in not believing that God hath given eternal life to the
   elect; for the most desperate unbelievers, such as Judas and Spira,
   believe that, and the belief of it adds to their anguish and torment of
   spirit; yet they do not set to their seal that God is true; but, on the
   contrary, they make God a liar, in not believing that to lost mankind,
   and to themselves in particular, God hath given eternal life in the way
   of grant, so as they, as well as others, are warranted and welcome to
   take possession of it, so fleeing in the face of God's record and
   testimony in the gospel, (Isa 9:6, John 3:16, Acts 4:12, Prov 8:4, Rev
   22:17). In believing of this, not in believing of the former, lies the
   difficulty, in the agonies of conscience; the which, nevertheless, till
   one do in greater or lesser measure surmount, one can never believe on
   Christ, receive and rest upon him for salvation. The truth is, the
   receiving of Christ doth necessarily presuppose this giving of him,
   There may, indeed, be a giving where there is no receiving, for a gift
   may be refused; and there may be a taking where there is no giving, the
   which is a presumptuous action without warrant; but there can be no
   place for receiving of Christ where there is not a giving of him
   before. "In the matter of faith, [says Rollock, Lect. 10 on 2 Thess p.
   126,] there are two things: first there is a giver, and next there is a
   receiver. God gives, and the soul receives." The Scripture is express
   to this purpose: "A man can receive nothing, except it be given him
   from heaven," (John 3:27).
   2. "And that you shall have life and salvation by him"; namely, a life
   of holiness, as well as of happiness,--salvation from sin as well as
   from wrath,--not in heaven only, but begun here and completed
   hereafter. That this is the author's notion of life and salvation
   agreeably to the Scripture, we have had sufficient evidence already,
   and will find more in our progress. Wherefore this persuasion of faith
   is inconsistent with an unwillingness to part with sin, a bent or
   purpose of heart to continue in sin, even as receiving and resting on
   Christ for salvation is. One finds it expressed almost in so many
   words: (Acts 15:11), "We believe that through the grace of the Lord
   Jesus Christ we shall be saved." It is fitly placed after the former,
   for it cannot go before it, but follows upon it. The former is a
   believing of God, or believing the Son: this is a believing on the Son,
   and so is the same with receiving of Christ, as that receiving is
   explained; (John 1:12), "But as many as received him, to them gave he
   power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
   name." It doth also evidently bear the soul's resting on Christ for
   salvation; for it is not possible to conceive a soul resting on Christ
   for salvation, without a persuasion that it shall have life and
   salvation by him; namely, a persuasion which is of the same measure and
   degree as the resting is. And thus it appears, that there can be no
   saving faith without this persuasion in greater or lesser measure. But
   withal, it is to be remembered, as to what concerns the habit, actings,
   exercise, strength, weakness, and intermitting of the exercise of
   saving faith, the same is to be said of this persuasion in all points.
   3. "That whatsoever Christ did for the redemption of mankind, he did it
   for you."--"I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and
   gave himself for me," (Gal 2:20). This comes in the last place; and I
   think none will question, but whosoever believes in the manner before
   explained, may and ought to believe this, in this order. And it is
   believed, if not explicitly, yet virtually, by all who receive and rest
   on Christ for salvation.
   From what is said, it appears that this definition of faith is the
   same, for substance and matter, though in different words, with that of
   the Shorter Catechism, which defines it, by "receiving and resting upon
   Christ alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the gospel." In
   which, though the offer to us is mentioned last, yet it is evident it
   is to be believed first.
   Object. But the author's definition makes assurance to be of the
   essence of faith?
   Answ. Be it so; however, he uses not the word assurance or assured in
   his definition; nor will anything contained in it amount to the idea
   now commonly affixed to that word, or to what is now in our days
   commonly understood by assurance. And, (1.) He doth not here teach that
   assurance of faith whereby believers are certainly assured that they
   are in the state of grace, the which is founded upon the evidence of
   grace, of which kind of assurance the Westminster Confession expressly
   treats, chap. 18, art. 1-3; but an assurance which is in faith, in the
   direct acts thereof, founded upon the word allenarly, (Mark 16:15,16,
   John 3:16); and this is nothing else but a fiducial appropriating
   persuasion. (2.) He doth not determine this assurance or persuasion to
   be full, or to exclude doubting: he says not, be fully persuaded, but,
   be verily persuaded, which speaks only the reality of the persuasion,
   and doth not at all concern the degree of it. And it is manifest, from
   his distinguishing between faith of adherence, and faith of evidence,
   [p. 99,] that, according to him, saving faith may be without evidence.
   And so one may have this assurance or persuasion, and yet not know
   assuredly that he hath it, but need marks to discover it by; for though
   a man cannot but be conscious of an act of his own soul as to the
   substance of the act, yet he may be in the dark as to the specifical
   nature of it, than which nothing is more ordinary among serious
   Christians. And thus, as a real saint is conscious of his own heart's
   moving in affection towards God, yet sometimes doth not assuredly know
   it to be the true love of God in him, but fears it to be an
   hypocritical flash of affection; so he may be conscious of his
   persuasion, and yet doubt if it is the true persuasion of faith, and
   not that of the hypocrite.
   This notion of assurance, or persuasion in faith, is so agreeable to
   the nature of the thing called believing, and to the style of the holy
   Scripture, that sometimes where the original text reads faith or
   believing, we read, assurance, according to the genuine sense of the
   original phrase; (Acts 17:31), "Whereof he hath given assurance"; orig.
   "faith," as is noted in the margin of our Bibles. (Deut 28:66), "Thou
   shalt have none assurance of thy life"; orig. "Thou shalt not believe
   in thy life." This observation shows, that to believe, in the style of
   the holy Scripture, as well as in the common usage of mankind in all
   other matters, is to be assured or persuaded, namely, according to the
   measure of one's believing.
   And the doctrine of assurance, or an appropriating persuasion in saving
   faith, as it is the doctrine of the holy Scripture, (Rom 10:9, Acts
   15:11, Gal 2:20), so it is a Protestant doctrine, taught by Protestant
   divines against the Papists, and sealed with the blood of martyrs in
   Popish flames; it is the doctrine of Reformed churches abroad, and the
   doctrine of the Church of Scotland.
   The nature of this work will not allow multiplying of testimonies on
   all these heads. Upon the first, it shall suffice to adduce the
   testimony of Essenius, in his Compendium Theologia, the system of
   divinity taught the students in the College of Edinburgh, by Professor
   Campbell. "There is, therefore," says he, "in saving faith, a special
   application of gospel benefits. This is proved against the Papists,
   (1.) From the profession of believers, (Gal 2:20), 'I live by that
   faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.'--(Psa
   23:1), 'The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want; in cotes of budding
   grass he makes me to lie down, &c. Though I walk through the valley of
   the shadow of death, I will not fear evil; for thou art with me,' &c.
   And Job 19:25; Philippians 1:21-23; Romans 8:33-39, 10:9,10; 2
   Corinthians 5:1-6, with 2 Corinthians 4:13, &c." Essen. Comp. Theol.
   chap. 2, sect. 12. And speaking of the method of faith, he says, it is
   "4. That according to the promises of the gospel, out of that spiritual
   desire, the Holy Spirit also bearing witness in us, we acknowledge
   Christ to be our Saviour, and so receive and apply him, every one to
   ourselves, apprehending him again, who first apprehended us, (2 Cor
   4:13, Rom 8:16, John 1:12, 2 Tim 1:12, Gal 2:20, Phil 3:12). The which
   is the formal act of saving faith. 5. Furthermore, that we acknowledge
   ourselves to be in communion with Christ, partakers of all and every
   one of his benefits. The which is the latter act of saving faith, yet
   also a proper and elicit act of it. 6. That we observe all these acts
   above mentioned, and the sincerity of them in us; and THENCE gather,
   that we are true believers, brought into the state of grace," &c. Ibid.
   sect. 21. Observe here the two kinds of assurance before distinguished.
   Peter Brulie, burnt at Tournay, anno 1545, when he was sent for out of
   prison to be examined, the friars interrogating him before the
   magistrate, he answered,--"How it is faith that bringeth unto us
   salvation; that is, when we trust unto God's promises, and believe
   steadfastly, that for Christ his son's sake our sins are forgiven us."
   Sleid. Comment. in English book 16, fol. 217.
   Mr. Patrick Hamilton, burnt at St. Andrews about the year 1527.
   "Faith," says he, "is a sureness; faith is a sure confidence of things
   which are hoped for, and a certainty of things which are not seen. The
   faith of Christ is to believe in him, that is, to believe in his word,
   and to believe that he will help thee in all thy need, and deliver thee
   from all evil." Mr. Patrick's Articles, Knox's History, 4 to. p. 9.
   For the doctrine of foreign churches on this point, I shall instance
   only in that of the Church of Holland, and the Reformed Church of
   France; "Q. What is a sincere faith? A. It is a sure knowledge of God
   and his promises revealed to us in the gospel, and a hearty confidence
   that all my sins are forgiven me for Christ's sake." Dutch Brief
   Compend. of Christian Religion, Vra. 19, bound up with the Dutch Bible.
   "Minister. Since we have the foundation upon which the faith is
   grounded, can we rightly from thence conclude what the true faith is?
   Child. Yea; namely, a certain and steady knowledge of the love of God
   towards us, according as, by his gospel, he declares himself to be our
   Father and Saviour, by the means of Jesus Christ." Catechism of the
   Reformed Church of France, bound up with the French Bible, Dimanche 18.
   To obviate a common prejudice, whereby this is taken for an easy effort
   of fancy and imagination, it will not be amiss to subjoin the question
   immediately following there.
   "M. Can we have it of ourselves, or cometh it from God? C. The
   Scripture teacheth us that it is a singular gift of the Holy Spirit,
   and experience also showeth it." Ibid.
   Follows the doctrine of the Church of Scotland on this head.
   "Regeneration is wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost, working in the
   hearts of the elect of God an assured faith in the promise of God,
   revealed to us in his word; by which faith we apprehend Christ Jesus,
   with the graces and benefits promised in him." Old Confess. art. 3.
   "This our faith, and the assurance of the same, proceeds not from flesh
   and blood, that is to say, from no natural powers within us, but is the
   inspiration of the Holy Ghost." Ibid. art. 12.
   For the better understanding of this, take the words of that eminent
   servant of Christ, Mr. John Davidson, minister of Salt-Preston, alias
   Preston-Pans [of whom see the fulfilling of the Scripture, p. 361,] in
   his Catechism, p. 20, as follows: "And certain it is, that both the
   enlightening of the mind to acknowledge the truth of the promise of
   salvation to us in Christ, and the sealing up of the certainty thereof
   in our hearts and minds, [of the which two parts, as it were, faith
   consists,] are the works and effects of the Spirit of God, and neither
   of nature nor art."
   The Old Confession above mentioned is, "The Confession of Faith,
   professed and believed by the Protestants within the realm of Scotland,
   published by them in Parliament, and by the estates thereof ratified
   and approved, as wholesome and sound doctrine, grounded upon the
   infallible truth of God," Knox's Hist. lib. 3. p. 263. It was ratified
   at Edinburgh, July 17, 1560, Ibid. p. 279. And this is the Confession
   of our Faith, mentioned and sworn to in the national covenant, framed
   about twenty years after it.
   In the same national covenant, with relation to this particular head of
   doctrine, we have these words following, viz: "We detest and refuse the
   usurped authority of that Roman antichrist--his general and doubtsome
   faith." However the general and doubtsome faith of the Papists may be
   clouded, one may, without much ado, draw these two plain conclusions
   from these words: "1. That since the Popish faith abjured is a
   doubtsome faith, the Protestant faith, sworn to be maintained, is an
   assured faith, as we heard before from the Old Confession, to which the
   covenant refers. 2. That since the Popish faith is a general one, the
   Protestant faith must needs be an appropriating persuasion, or a faith
   of special application, which, we heard already from Essenius, the
   Papists do deny. As for a belief and persuasion of the mercy of God in
   Christ, and of Christ's ability and willingness to save all that come
   unto him, as it is altogether general, and hath nothing of
   appropriation or special application in it, so I doubt if the Papists
   will refuse it. Sure, the Council of Trent, which fixed and established
   the abominations of Popery, affirms that not pious man ought to doubt
   of the mercy of God, of the merit of Christ, nor of the virtue and
   efficacy of the sacraments." Concil. Trid. cap. 9. I hope none will
   think the council allows impious men to doubt of these; but withal they
   tell us, "It is not to be affirmed, that no man is absolved from sin
   and justified, but he who assuredly believes, that he himself is
   absolved and justified." Here they overturn the assurance and
   appropriation, or special application of saving faith maintained by the
   Protestants; and they thunder their anathemas against those who hold
   these in opposition to their general and doubtsome faith. "If any shall
   say, that justifying faith is nothing else but a confidence of the
   mercy of God pardoning sins for Christ's sake, or that confidence is it
   alone by which they are justified, let him be accursed." Ibid. cap. 13,
   can. 12. "If any shall say, that a man is absolved from sin, and
   justified by that, that he assuredly believes himself to be absolved
   and justified, let him be accursed." Ibid. can. 14.
   Moreover, in the national covenant, as it was renewed in the years 1638
   and 1639, mention is made of public catechisms, in which the true
   religion is expressed in the Confession of Faith [there] above written,
   [i.e., the national covenant, otherwise called the Confession of
   Faith,] and former Large Confession, [viz: the Old Confession,] is said
   to be set down. The doctrine on this head, contained in these
   catechisms, is here subjoined.
   "M. Which is the first point? C. To put our whole confidence in God. M.
   How may that be? C. When we have assured knowledge that he is almighty,
   and perfectly good. M. And is that sufficient? C. No. M. What is then
   further required? C. That every one of us be fully assured in his
   conscience, that he is beloved of God, and that he will be both his
   Father and Saviour." Calvin's Cat. used by the Kirk of Scotland, and
   approved by the First Book of Discipline, quest. 8-12. This is the
   catechism of the Reformed Church of France, mentioned before. "M. Since
   we have the foundation whereupon our faith is builded, we may well
   gather hereof what is the right faith? C. Yea, verily; that is to say,
   it is a sure persuasion and steadfast knowledge of God's tender love
   towards us, according as he hath plainly uttered in his gospel, that he
   will be both a Father and a Saviour unto us, through the means of Jesus
   Christ." Ibid. quest. 111.
   "M. By what means may we attain unto him there? C. By faith, which
   God's Spirit worketh in our hearts, assuring us of God's promises made
   to us in his holy Gospel." The manner to examine children before they
   be admitted to the supper of the Lord, quest. 16. This is called the
   Little Catechism, Assembly 1592, sess. 10. "Q. What is true faith? A.
   It is not only a knowledge, by which I do steadfastly assent to all
   things which God hath revealed unto us in his word; but also an assured
   affiance, kindled in my heart by the Holy Ghost, by which I rest upon
   God, making sure account, that forgiveness of sins, everlasting
   righteousness, and life, are bestowed, not only upon others, but also
   upon me, and that freely by the mercy of God, for the merit and desert
   of Christ alone." The Palatine Catechism, printed by public authority,
   for the use of Scotland. This famous Catechism is used in most of the
   Reformed Churches and schools; particularly in the Reformed Churches of
   the Netherlands, and is bound up with the Dutch Bible. "As for the
   Church of Scotland, the Palatine Catechism," says Mr. Wodrow, in the
   dedication to his History, "was adopted by us, till we had the
   happiness to join with the venerable Assembly at Westminster. Then
   indeed it gave place to the Larger and Shorter Catechisms in the
   Church: nevertheless it continued to be taught in grammar schools."
   "Q. What thing is faith in Christ? A. A sure persuasion that he is the
   only Saviour of the world, but OURS in special, who believe in him."
   Craig's Catechism, approved by the General Assembly, 1592.
   To these may be added the three following testimonies. "Q. What is
   faith? A. When I am persuaded that God loves me and all his saints, and
   freely giveth us Christ, with all his benefits," Summula Catechismi,
   still annexed to the Rudiments of the Latin tongue, and taught in
   grammar schools to this day, [1726,] since the Reformation.
   "What is thy faith? My sure belief that God both may and will save me
   in the blood of Jesus Christ, because he is almighty, and has promised
   so to do," Mr. James Melvil's Catechism, in his Propine of a Pastor to
   his People, p. 44, published in the year 1598.
   "Q. What is this faith, that is the only instrument of this strait
   conjunction between Christ crucified and us? A. It is the sure
   persuasion of the heart, that Christ by his death and resurrection hath
   taken away our sins, and, clothing us with his own righteousness, has
   thoroughly restored us to the favour of God." Mr. John Davidson's
   Catechism, p. 46.
   In the same national covenant, as it was renewed, 1638 and 1639, is
   expressed an agreement and resolution to labour to recover the purity
   of the gospel as it was established and professed before the [there]
   foresaid novations; the which, in the time of Prelacy, then cast out,
   had been corrupted by a set of men in Scotland addicted to the faction
   of Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. In the year 1640, Mr. Robert Baily,
   then minister of Kilwinning, afterwards one of the Commissioners from
   Scotland to the Westminster Assembly, wrote against that faction,
   proving them guilty of Popery, Arminianism, &c.: and on the head of
   Popery, thus represents their doctrine concerning the nature of faith,
   viz: "That faith is only a bare assent, and requires no application, no
   personal confidence; and that that personal application is mere
   presumption, and the fiction of a crazy brain." Hist. Motuum in Regno
   Scotia, p. 517.
   Thus, as above declared, stood the doctrine of the Church of Scotland,
   in this point, in her confessions, and in public catechisms, confirmed
   by the renewing of the national covenant, when, in the year 1643, it
   was anew confirmed by the first article of the Solemn League and
   Covenant, binding to [not the Reformation, but] the preservation of the
   Reformed Religion in the Church of Scotland, in doctrine, &c., and that
   before the Westminster Confession, Larger and Shorter Catechisms, were
   in being.
   When the Westminster Confession was received, anno 1647, and the Larger
   and Shorter Catechisms, anno 1648, the General Assembly did, in their
   three acts, respectively approving them, expressly declare them to be
   in nothing contrary to the received doctrine of this Kirk. And put the
   case they were contrary thereto in any point, they could not in that
   point be reckoned the judgment of the Church of Scotland, since they
   were received by her, as in nothing contrary to previous standards of
   doctrine, to which she stands bound by the covenants aforesaid. But the
   truth is, the doctrine is the same in them all.
   "This faith is different in degrees, weak or strong; growing in many to
   the attainment of a full assurance." Westm. Confess, chap. 14, art. 3.
   Now, how faith can grow in any to a full assurance, if there be no
   assurance in the nature of it, I cannot comprehend.
   "Faith justifies a sinner--only as it is an instrument, by which he
   receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness." Larg. Cat. Q.
   73.--"By faith they receive and apply unto themselves Christ crucified,
   and all the benefits of his death." Ibid. Q. 170.
   "Q. When do we by faith receive and apply to ourselves the body of
   Christ crucified? A. While we are persuaded, that the death and
   crucifixion of Christ do no less belong to us, than if we ourselves had
   been crucified for our own sins; now this persuasion is that of true
   faith." Sum. Catech.
   "Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we receive and rest
   upon him alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the gospel."
   Short. Cat.
   Now, to perceive the entire harmony betwixt this and the old
   definitions of faith, compare with it, as to the receiving therein
   mentioned, the definition above cited from the Old Confession, art. 3.
   viz: "An assured faith in the promise by which they apprehend Christ,"
   &c. Mr. John Davidson joins them thus: "Q. What is faith? A. It is an
   hearty assurance, that our sins are freely forgiven us in Christ. Or
   after this manner: It is the hearty receiving of Christ offered in the
   preaching of the word and sacraments, by the working of the Holy
   Spirit, for the remission of sins, whereby he becomes one with us, and
   we one with him, he our head, and we his members." Mr. John Davidson's
   Catechism, p. 24. As to the resting mentioned in the Westminster
   definition, compare the definition above cited from the Palatine
   Catechism, viz: "A sure confidence whereby I rest in God, assuredly
   concluding, that to me is given forgiveness," &c., quest. 21. See also
   Larger Catechism, quest. last. "We by faith are emboldened to plead
   with him that he would, and quietly to rely upon him that he will,
   fulfil our request; and to testify this our desire and assurance, we
   say, Amen." In which words, it is manifest, that quietly to rely upon
   him that he will, &c. [the same with resting on him for, &c.] is
   assurance in the sense of the Westminster divines.

   [175] Mr. Culverwell's words, here cited, stand thus at large: "The
   matter to be believed unto salvation is this, that God the Father,
   moved by nothing but his free love to mankind lost, hath made a deed of
   gift and grant of his son Christ Jesus unto mankind, that whosoever of
   all mankind shall receive his gift by a true and lively faith, he shall
   not perish, but have everlasting life." Dr. Gouge, in his preface to
   this treatise of that author, has these remarkable words concerning
   him, "Never any took such pains to so good purpose, in and about the
   foundation of faith, as he hath done." This deed of gift and grant, or
   authentic gospel-offer [of which see the preceding note] is expressed
   in so many words, (John 3:16), "For God so loved the world, that he
   gave his only begotten Son, that WHOSOEVER believeth in him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life." Where the gospel comes, this grant
   is published, and the ministerial offer made and there is no exception
   of any of all mankind in the grant. If there was, no ministerial offer
   of Christ could be warrantably made to the party excepted, more than to
   the fallen angels; and without question, the publishing and proclaiming
   of heaven's grant unto any, by way of ministerial offer, pre-supposeth
   the grant, in the first place, to be made to them: otherwise, it would
   be of no more value than a crier's offering of the king's pardon to one
   who is not comprehended in it. This is the good old way of discovering
   to sinners their warrant to believe in Christ; and it doth indeed bear
   the sufficiency of the sacrifice of Christ for all, and that Christ
   crucified is the ordinance of God for salvation unto all mankind, in
   the use-making of which only they can be saved; but not an universal
   atonement or redemption. "What is thy faith? My sure belief that God
   both may and will save me, &c. Tell me the promise whereon thou leanest
   assuredly? 'Whosoever [says God] will believe in the death of my Son
   Jesus, shall not perish, but get eternal life.'" Mr. James Melvil's
   Cat. ubi sup. "He freely OFFERETH unto SINNERS life and salvation by
   Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in him, that they may be saved."
   Mark 16:15,16; John 3:16; Westm. Confess. chap. 7. art. 3. "The visible
   Church hath the privilege of enjoying OFFERS of grace by Christ to all
   the members of it in the ministry of the gospel, testifying that
   WHOSOEVER believes in him shall be saved." Larger Catechism, quest. 63.
   "This general offer, in substance, is equivalent to a special offer
   made to every one in particular, as appears by the apostle making use
   of it, (Acts 16:31). The reason of which offer is given, (John 3:16)."
   Pract. Use of Sav. Knowledge; Conf. p. 380. The Synod of Dort may be
   heard without prejudice on this head. "It is the promise of the gospel
   [say they,] that whosoever believeth in Christ crucified should not
   perish, but have life everlasting; which promise, together with the
   injunction of repentance and faith, ought promiscuously, and without
   distinction, to be declared, and published to all men and people, to
   whom God in his good pleasure sends the gospel," chap. 2, art. 5. But
   forasmuch as many, being called by the gospel, do not repent nor
   believe in Christ, but perish in their infidelity, this comes not to
   pass for want of, or by any insufficiency of, the sacrifice of Christ
   offered upon the cross, but by their own default, art. 6.

   [176] That is, from this deed of gift and grant it was that the
   ministerial offer was appointed to be made in the most extensive terms.

   [177] That the reader may have a more clear view of this passage, which
   is taken from Dr. Preston's Treatise of Faith, I shall transcribe the
   whole paragraph in which it is found. That eminent divine, speaking of
   that righteousness by which alone we can be saved, and having shown
   that it is communicated by gift, says, "But when you hear this
   righteousness is given, the next question will be, to whom is it given?
   If it be only given to some, what comfort is this to me? But [which is
   the ground of all comfort,] it is given to every man,--there is not a
   man excepted; for which we have the sure word of God, which will not
   fail. When you have the charter of a king well confirmed, you reckon it
   a matter of great moment: what is it then when you have the charter of
   God himself? which you shall evidently see in those two places, (Mark
   16:15), 'Go and preach the gospel to every creature under heaven'; What
   is that? Go and tell every man, without exception that here is good
   news for him; Christ is dead for him: and if he will take him, and
   accept of his righteousness, he shall have it; restraint is not; but go
   tell every man under heaven. The other text is, (Rev 22:17), 'Whosoever
   will, let him come, and take of the water of life freely.' There is a
   quicunque vult, whosoever will come [none excepted] may have life, and
   it shall cost him nothing. Many other places of Scripture there be to
   prove the generality of the offer; and having a sure word for it,
   consider it," p. 7,8. The words "under heaven" are taken from
   Colossians 1:23. The scope here is the same with that of our author,
   not to determine concerning the extent of Christ's death, but to
   discover the warrant sinners have to believe in Christ, namely, that
   the offer of Christ is general, the deed of gift or grant is to every
   man. This necessarily supposeth Christ crucified to be the ordinance of
   God for salvation, to which lost mankind is allowed access, and not
   fallen angels, for whom there is none provided: even as the city of
   refuge was the ordinance of God for the safety of the man-slayer, who
   had killed any person unawares, (Num 35:16); and the brazen serpent for
   the cure of those bitten by a serpent, (21:8). Therefore he says not,
   "Tell every man Christ died for him"; but, Tell every man "Christ is
   dead for him"; that is, for him to come to, and believe on; a Saviour
   is provided for him; there is a crucified Christ for him, the ordinance
   of heaven for salvation for lost man, in the use-making of which he may
   be saved; even as one had said of old, Tell every man that hath slain
   any person unawares, that the city of refuge is prepared for him,
   namely, to flee to, that he may be safe; and every one bitten by a
   serpent, that the brazen serpent is set up on a pole for him, namely,
   to look unto, that he may be healed. Both these were eminent types of
   Christ; and upon the latter, the Scripture is full and clear in this
   very point. (Num 21:8), "And the Lord said unto Moses, make thee a
   fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole; and it shall come to pass, that
   EVERY ONE that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live."--(John
   3:14-16), "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even
   so must the son of man be lifted up; that WHOSOEVER believeth on him
   should not perish but have eternal life." "For God so loved the world,
   that he gave his only begotten Son, that WHOSOEVER," &c. Thus, what
   [according to Dr. Preston and our author] is to be told every man, is
   no more than what ministers of the gospel have in commission from their
   great Master, (Matt 22:4), "Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have
   prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things
   are ready, come unto the marriage." There is a crucified Saviour, with
   all saving benefits, for them to come to, feed upon, and partake of
   freely. See also Luke 2:30,31; Proverbs 9:2-4; Isaiah 25:6. To confirm
   this to be the true and designed sense of the phrase in question,
   compare the following three passages, of the same treatise, giving the
   import of the same text, (Mark 16), "Christ hath provided a
   righteousness and salvation, that is, his work that he hath done
   already. Now, if ye will believe, and take him upon these terms that he
   is offered, you shall be saved. This, I say, belongs to all men. This
   you have expressed in the gospel in many places: 'If you believe you
   shall be saved': as it is, (Mark 16), 'Go and preach the gospel to
   every creature under heaven; he that will believe shall be saved.'"
   Preston on Faith, p. 32. "You must first have Christ himself, before
   you can partake of those benefits by him: and that I take to be the
   meaning of that in Mark 16, 'Go preach the gospel to every creature
   under heaven; he that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved'; that
   is, he that will believe, that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, and
   that he is offered to mankind for a Saviour, and will be baptized; that
   will give up himself to him, that will take his mark upon him, shall be
   saved." Ibid. p. 46. "Go and preach the gospel to every creature; go
   and tell every man under heaven, that Christ is offered to him, he is
   freely given to him by God the Father; and there is nothing required of
   you but that you marry him, nothing but to accept of him." Ibid. p. 75.
   Thus, it appears, that universal atonement, or redemption, is not
   taught here, neither by our author. But that the candid reader may be
   satisfied as to his sentiments touching the question,--"for whom Christ
   died"? let him weigh these two things: 1. Our author puts a man's being
   persuaded that Christ died for him in particular, in the definition of
   saving faith, and that as the last and highest step of it. But
   Arminians, and other Universalists, might as well put there a man's
   being persuaded that he was created, or is preserved by Jesus Christ;
   since in being persuaded that Christ died for him, he applies no more
   to himself than what, according to their principles, is common to all
   mankind, as in the case of creation and preservation. Hear Grotius upon
   this head: "Some," says he, "have here interpreted faith to be
   persuasion, whereby a man believes that Jesus died for him in
   particular, and to purchase salvation all manner of ways for him, or
   [what with them is the same thing] that he is elected; when, on the
   contrary, Paul in many places teaches, 'that Christ died for all men';
   and such a faith as they talk of, has not in it anything true or
   profitable." Grotius apud Pol. Synop. Those whom this learned adversary
   here taxes, are Protestant anti-Arminian divines. Those were they who
   defined faith by such a persuasion, and not the Universalists. On the
   contrary, he argues against that definition of faith from the doctrine
   of universal atonement or redemption. He rejects that definition of it,
   as in his opinion having nothing in it true, namely, according to the
   principles of those who gave it, viz: that Christ died, not for all and
   every man in particular, but for the elect only, and as having nothing
   in it profitable; that being, according to his principles, the common
   privilege of all mankind. 2. He teaches plainly throughout the book,
   that they were the elect, the chosen, or believers, whom Christ
   represented, and obeyed, and suffered for. See among others, pages 22,
   23, 54, 86. I shall repeat only two passages; the one, page 81:
   "According to that eternal and mutual agreement that was betwixt God
   the Father and him, he put himself in the room and place of all the
   faithful." The other in the first sentence of his own preface, viz:
   "Jesus Christ, the second Adam, did, as a common person, enter into
   covenant with God his Father for all the elect, [that is to say, all
   those that have or shall believe on his name,] and for them kept it."
   What can be more plain than that, in the judgment of our author, they
   were the elect whom Jesus Christ, the second Adam, entered into
   covenant with God for; that it was in the elect's room he put himself
   when he came actually to obey and suffer, and that it was for the elect
   he kept that covenant, by doing and suffering what was required of him
   as our Redeemer? As for the description, or character he gives of the
   elect, viz: that by the elect he understands all that have or shall
   believe in it, he follows our Lord himself, (John 17:20), "Neither pray
   I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me"; and so
   doing, he is accompanied with orthodox divines. "Thus did the sin of
   all God's elect, or all true believers, [for of such, and only such, he
   there, viz: (Isa 53:6), speaks,] meet together upon the head of their
   common surety, the Lord Christ," Brinsley's Mesites, p. 64. "The Father
   is well satisfied with the undertakings of the Son, who entered
   Redeemer and Surety to pay the ransom of believers," Pract. Use of
   Saving Knowl. tit. 4. "The invisible church is the whole number of the
   elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one, under Christ
   the head," Larg. Cat. quest. 64. "Christ's church, wherein standeth
   only remission of sins, purchased by Christ's blood to all them that
   believe," The Confess. of Faith used in Geneva, approved by the Church
   of Scotland, sect. 4. sect. ult. But Arminians neither will nor can, in
   consistency with their principles touching election and the falling
   away of believers, admit that description or character of the elect,
   else they are widely mistaken by one of their own, who tells us that,
   "Upon the consideration of his [viz: Christ's] blood, as shed, he [viz:
   God] decreed, that all those who should believe in that Redeemer, and
   persevere in that faith, should, through mercy and grace, by him be
   made partakers of salvation," Exam. of Tilen. p. 131. "Brought unto
   faith, and persevere therein; this being the condition required in
   every one that is to be elected unto eternal life," Ibid. p. 139.
   Behold the Arminian election: "They do utterly deny that God did
   destine, by an absolute decree, to give Christ a Mediator only to the
   elect, and to give faith to them alone," Ibid. p. 149. As for
   Universalists, not Arminians, "They contend, that the decree of the
   death of Christ did go before the decree of election, and that God, in
   sending of Christ, had no respect unto some, more than others, but
   destined Christ for a Saviour to all men alike." This account of their
   principles is given us by Turretine, loc. 14, q. 14, th. 6. I leave it
   to the impartial reader to judge of the evident contrariety betwixt
   this and our author's words above repeated.

   [178] Namely, the deed of gift and grant, or the offer of Christ in the
   word, of which our author is all along speaking. And if there be any
   man to whom it doth not belong particularly, that man hath no warrant
   to believe on Jesus Christ: and whosoever pretends to believe on him,
   without believing that the grant or offer belongs to himself
   particularly, does but act presumptuously, as seeing no warrant he has
   to believe on Christ, whatever others may have.

   [179] So far as he hath made the deed of gift and grant, or authentic
   gospel-offer of the pardon of all our sins, as of all other saving
   benefits in Christ. Such a thing, among men, is called the king's
   pardon, though, in the mean time, none have the benefit of it but such
   as come in upon its being proclaimed, and accept of it; and why may not
   it be called the King of heaven's pardon? The holy Scripture warrants
   this manner of expression. "And this is the record, that God hath given
   to us eternal life," (1 John 5:11); in which life, without question,
   the pardon of all our sins is included: "Through this man is preached
   unto you the forgiveness of sins," (Acts 13:38). The preaching of the
   gospel is the proclaiming of pardon to condemned sinners. But pardon of
   sin cannot be preached or proclaimed, unless, in the first place, it be
   granted, even as the king's pardon must be, before one can proclaim it
   to the rebels. That this is all that is meant by pardon here, and not a
   formal personal pardon, is evident from the whole strain of the
   author's discourse upon it. In the proposal of the simile, whereof this
   passage is the application, he tells us, that after it hath pleased the
   king [thus] to pardon the rebels, they ought not to doubt but they
   shall obtain pardon; and in the following paragraph he brings in
   Neophytus objecting, that in such a case an earthly king doth indeed
   intend to pardon all, but the King of heaven doth not so; the which
   Evangelista in his answer grants. So that, for all this general pardon,
   the formal personal pardon remains to be obtained by the sinner,
   namely, by his accepting of the pardon offered. And in the foresaid
   answer, he expounds the pardon in question, of the Lord's offering
   pardon generally to all. This, one would think, may well be admitted as
   the fruit of Christ's obedience and desert, without supposing an
   universal atonement or redemption. And to restrain it to any set of men
   whatsoever under heaven, is to restrain the authentic gospel-offer: of
   which before.

   [180] (Col 1:23): "The gospel which ye have heard, and which was
   preached to every creature which is under heaven."

   [181] Make no doubt of the pardon offered, or of the proclamation,
   bearing, that every one of us may safely return to God in Christ; but
   thereupon draw near to him in full assurance of faith. That there can
   be no saving faith, no acceptance with God, where there is any
   doubting, is what can hardly enter into the head of any sober
   Christian, if he is not under a grievous temptation, in his own soul's
   case, nor is it in the least insinuated here. Nevertheless, the
   doubting mixed with faith is sin, and dishonoureth God, and believers
   have ground to be humbled for it, and ashamed of it, before the Lord;
   and therefore the full assurance of faith is duty. The Papists indeed
   contend earnestly for doubting, and they know very very well, wherefore
   they so do; for doubting being removed, and the assurance of faith in
   the promise of the gospel brought into its room, their market is
   marred, their gain by indulgences, masses, pilgrimages, &c., is gone,
   and the fire of purgatory extinguished. But, as Protestant divines
   prove against them, the holy Scripture condemns it, (Matt 14:31), "O
   thou of little faith! wherefore didst thou doubt?" (Luke 12:29),
   "Neither be ye of doubtful mind." (1 Tim 2:8), "Lifting up holy hands,
   without wrath and doubting."

   [182] Had the author once dreamt of an universal pardon, otherwise than
   that God offers the pardon generally to all, all this had been
   needless; it would have furnished him with a short answer, viz: That
   God hath pardoned all already.

   [183] By believing the offered pardon, with particular application to
   himself; without which one can never accept of it, but will undoubtedly
   come short of it.

   [184] Like that man mentioned Mark 9:24, who at once did and said.

   [185] Believe on the name of Christ.

   [186] Namely, your believing.

   [187] This is what is commonly called the reflex act of faith, which
   presupposes, and here includes the direct act, namely, a man's doing of
   his duty, in obedience to the command to believe on Christ; by
   reflecting on which, he may put it out of question that he is a
   believer, one of God's elect, and one of those for whom Christ died.
   This passage is taken out of Dr. Preston's Treatise of Faith, p. 8.

   [188] "This manner of applying," says Luther, "is the very true force
   and power of faith."

   [189] He had told him, that for his warrant to believe on Christ, he
   had God's command, (1 John 3:23). And for his encouragement, God's
   promise, (John 3:16). Thereupon this question is moved; the particular
   application to oneself being a matter of no small difficulty in the
   experience of many who lay salvation to heart.

   [190] Believe the word of promise, the offer of the spiritual marriage,
   which is Christ's declared consent to be yours. Believe that it is made
   to you in particular, and that it shall be made out to you; the which
   is, to embrace the offer, to receive Christ, as the evangelist teaches,
   (John 1:12); [which was adverted to before;] so shall you be indeed
   married or espoused to Christ. Thus the holy Scripture proposes this
   matter, (Isa 55:3), "Hear and your soul shall live, and I will make an
   everlasting covenant with you"; to persuade us of the reality of the
   covenant betwixt God and the believer of his word, "the Father hath
   made a fourfold gift," &c., Pract. Use of Sav. Knowl. tit.; Warrant to
   Believer, fig. 7; compare Isaiah 53:1; Hebrews 4:1,2.

   [191] An eminent type of this glorious mystery was that tabernacle so
   often mentioned in the Old Testament under the name of the tabernacle
   of the congregation, or rather the tabernacle of meeting, as the
   original word bears; and the Lord himself seems to give the reason of
   the name, (Exo 30:36), "In the tabernacle of the congregation, where I
   will meet with thee"; or, "in the tabernacle of meeting, where I will
   be met with by thee."--(33:7), "And it came to pass, that every one
   which sought the Lord, went out unto the tabernacle of the
   congregation," or meeting.

   [192] The acceptation, love, and the favour of God here treated of, do
   not refer to the real state of believers, but to the relative state, to
   their justification, reconciliation, and adoption: and so they have no
   respect to any qualities inherent in them, good or evil, to be
   increased by the one, or diminished by the other; but they proceed
   purely upon the righteousness of Christ, which is theirs in virtue of
   their union with him, and is imputed to them; the which righteousness
   is the self-same righteousness wherewith Christ, as Mediator and Surety
   for elect sinners, pleased the Father. And therefore, says one, whom
   nobody suspects of Antinomianism, "We are as perfectly righteous as
   Christ the Righteous," citing 1 John 3:7: "He that doth righteousness
   is righteous, even as he is righteous," Isaac Ambrose's Media, chap. 1,
   sect. 2, p. 4. This I take to be the true meaning of the passages of
   our author and Isaac Ambrose, expressed in terms stronger than I would
   desire to use. There is a danger in expressing concerning God even what
   is true.

   [193] The original word here rendered "one," indeed signifies "one
   thing." And it is evident from the text, that believers are united to
   God as well as to Christ. "Faith is that grace by which we are united
   to, and made one with, God and Christ," says the author of the
   Supplement to Poole's Annot. on the place. See 1 John 4:16; 2
   Corinthians 4:16, compared with Ephesians 3:17. And whosoever owns
   Jesus Christ to be one with the Father, must needs grant this, or else
   deny believers to be united to Christ. This derogates nothing from the
   prerogative of our Lord Jesus, who is one with the Father; for he is
   one with him, as the Holy Ghost also is, by the adorable substantial
   union; but believers are so only by mystical union. Neither does it
   entrench upon God's supremacy, more than their confessed union with
   Christ does; who, notwithstanding of believers' union with him, remains
   to be, with the Father and Holy Spirit, the only supreme, and most high
   God. "Whosoever, therefore, cleaveth to Christ through faith, he
   abideth in the favour of God, he also shall be made beloved and
   acceptable as Christ is, and shall have fellowship with the Father and
   the Son." Luther's Chosen Sermons, Sermon of the Appearing of Christ,
   p. 23. "Here I will abide in the arms of Christ, cleaving inseparably
   about his neck, and creeping into his bosom, whatsoever the law shall
   say, and my heart shall feel," Ibid. Sermon of the Lost Sheep, p. 81.
   "Seeing, therefore, that Christ, the beloved Son, being in so great
   favour with God in all things that he does, is thine; without doubt,
   thou art in the same favour and love of God that Christ himself is in."
   And again, "the favour and love of God are insinuated to thee as deeply
   as to Christ, that now God, together with his beloved Son, does wholly
   possess thee, and thou hast him again wholly; that so God, Christ, and
   thou, do become as one certain thing,--that they may be one in us, as
   thou and I are one, John 17." Ibid. Sermon of the Appearing of Christ,
   p. 25.

   [194] Luther, from whom this is taken, in the place quoted by our
   author, confirms it thus; "For he that is a searcher of God's majesty,
   shall be overwhelmed of his glory. I know [adds he] by experience, what
   I say. But these vain spirits, which so deal with God, that they
   exclude the Mediator, do not believe me." And on Psalm 130, he has
   these remarkable words, "Ego sepe, et libenter hoc inculco, ut extra
   Christum, oculos et aures claudatis, et dicatis nullum vos scire Deum
   nisi qui fuit in gremio Maria, et suxit ubera ejus": that is, "Often
   and willingly do I inculcate this, that you should shut your eyes and
   your ears, and say, you know no God out of Christ, none but him that
   was in the lap of Mary, and suckled her breasts." He means none out of
   him. Burroughs on Hosea 3:5, p. 729.

   [195] This is the conclusion of that, which one, "by faith cleaving
   unto Christ, and hanging about his neck," has by that means warrant to
   say, according to our author. Whether or not there is sufficient
   warrant for it, according to the Scripture, let the reader judge: what
   shadow of the doctrine of universal atonement, or universal pardon, is
   in it, I see not.

   [196] That is, such as are really so, and not, in their own opinion,
   only respectively.

   [197] As the people, observing Christ's call to Bartimeus, bid him be
   of good comfort, [or be confident] and arise; intimating, that upon his
   going so unto Christ, he would cure him; so one, observing the gospel
   call, may with all boldness bid a sinner comply with it confidently;
   assuring him that thereupon Christ will justify and save him.

   [198] It is to believe the offer of the gospel, with particular
   application; to embrace it, and therein to receive Christ. And no man
   can ever receive and rest on Christ for salvation, without believing,
   in greater, or lesser measure, that Christ will accept of him to
   justification and salvation. Remove that gospel truth, that Christ will
   accept of him, and his faith has no ground left to stand upon.

   [199] I doubt if the sin against the Holy Ghost can justly be said to
   be a limitation of God's grace in Jesus Christ. For in the original
   authentic gospel-offer, in which is the proper place for such a
   limitation [if there was any] that grace is so laid open to all men
   without exception, that no man is excluded; but there is free access to
   it for every man in the way of believing, (John 3:15,16, Rev 22:17);
   and this offer is sometimes intimated to these reprobates, who fall
   into that sin, else they should not be capable of it. It is true, that
   sin is a bar in the way of the guilty, so as they can never partake of
   the grace of God in Christ; for it shall never be forgiven, (Matt
   12:31, Mark 3:29); and any further ministerial application of the offer
   to them seems to cease to be lawful or warranted, (1 John 5:16). But
   all this arises from their own willful, obstinate, despiteful, and
   malicious rejecting of the offer: and fighting against the Holy Ghost,
   whose office it is to apply the grace of Christ; and not from any
   limitation, or exclusive clause in the offer, for still it remains
   true, "Whosoever shall believe, shall not perish."

   [200] Which may put you in mind, that you are one of that sort which
   "Christ Jesus came into the world to save," (1 Tim 1:15); and in
   pleading for mercy, may furnish you with such an argument as David
   used, (Psa 25:11), and the woman of Canaan, (Matt 15:27), "yet the dogs
   eat of the crumbs," &c.

   [201] He adds, in the place quoted, these weighty words, "I say not
   this for nought; for I have often-times proved by experience, and I
   daily find what an hard matter it is to believe [especially in the
   conflict of conscience] that Christ was given, not for the holy,
   righteous, worthy, and such as were his friends; but for wicked
   sinners, for the unworthy, and for his enemies."

   [202] It is not in vain added, "if he can"; for there is, in this
   matter, a great difference betwixt what a sinner may do, in point of
   warrant, and what he will or can do, in point of the event. "If we say
   to a man, the physician is ready to heal you; before you will be
   healed, you must have a sense of your sickness: this sense is not
   required by the physician [for the physician is ready to heal him]; but
   if he be not sick, and have a sense of it, he will not come to the
   physician." Preston on Faith, p. 12. I make no question, but before a
   sinner will come to Christ by believing, he must be an awakened,
   convinced, sensible sinner; pricked in his heart with a sense of his
   sin and misery; made to groan under his burden to despair of relief
   from the law, himself, or any other creature, and to desire and thirst
   after Christ and his righteousness; and this our author teaches
   afterwards on this subject. These things also are required of the
   sinner in point of duty. And, therefore, the law must be preached by
   all those who would preach Christ aright. But that these, or any other
   things in the sinner, are required to warrant him, that he may come to
   Christ by believing, is what I conceive the Scripture teaches not; but
   the general offer of the gospel, of which before, warrants every man
   that he may come. And in practice, it will be found, that requiring of
   such and such qualifications in sinners to warrant them to believe in
   Christ, is no great help to them in their way toward him; forasmuch as
   it engages them in a doubtful disputation, as to the being, kind,
   measure, and degree of their qualifications for coming to Christ; the
   time spent in which might be better improved in their going forward to
   Christ for all, by believing. And since no man can ever believe in
   Christ, without knowing that he has a warrant for believing in him,
   otherwise he can but act presumptuously: to tell sinners, that none may
   come to Christ, or have warrant to believe, but such as have a true
   repentance, must needs, in a special manner, entangle distressed
   consciences, so as they dare not believe, until they know their
   repentance to be true repentance. This must inevitably be the issue in
   that case; unless they do either reject that principle, or else venture
   to believe without seeing their warrant. For, howbeit they hear of
   Christ and his salvation offered in the gospel, these will be to them
   as forbidden fruit, which they are not allowed to touch, till once they
   are persuaded, that they have true repentance. And before they can
   attain to this, it must be made out to their consciences, that their
   repentance is not legal but evangelical, having such characters as
   distinguish it from the repentance of the Ninevites, Judas, and many
   reprobates. So that, one would think the suggesting of this principle
   is but a bad office done to a soul brought to "the place of the
   breaking forth of children." Let no man say, that, arguing at this
   rate, one must know also the truth of his faith, before he can come to
   Christ; for faith is not a qualification for coming to Christ, but the
   coming itself, which will have its saving effects on the sinner,
   whether he knows the truth of it or not.

   [203] Take them freely, and possess them; which every one sees to be no
   proper condition.

   [204] That gospel-offer, (Isa 55:1), is the most solemn one to be found
   in all the Old Testament; and that recorded, (Rev 22:17), is the
   parting offer made to sinners by Jesus Christ, at the closing of the
   canon of the Scripture, and manifestly looks to the former; in the
   which I can see no ground to think, that the thirsting therein
   mentioned does any way restrict the offer; or that the thirsty there
   invited, are convinced, sensible sinners, who are thirsting after
   Christ and his righteousness; the which would leave without the compass
   of this solemn invitation, not only the far greater part of mankind,
   but even of the visible church. The context seems decisive in this
   point; for the thirsting ones invited, are such as are "spending money
   for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which satisfieth
   not," (verse 1,2); but convinced, sensible sinners who are thirsting
   after Christ and his righteousness, are not spending their labour and
   money at that rate; but, on the contrary, for that which is bread and
   satisfieth, namely, for Christ. Wherefore, the thirsting there
   mentioned, must be more extensive, comprehending, yea, and principally
   aiming at that thirst after happiness and satisfaction, which, being
   natural, is common to all mankind. Men pained with this thirst or
   hunger are naturally running, for quenching thereof, to the empty
   creation, and their fulsome lusts; so "spending money for that which is
   not bread, and their labour for that which satisfieth not," their
   hungry souls find no food, but what is meagre and lean, bad and
   unwholesome, and cannot satisfy their appetite. Compare Luke 15:16. In
   this wretched case Adam left all mankind, and Christ finds them.
   Whereupon the gospel proclamation is issued forth, inviting them to
   come away from the broken cisterns, filthy puddles, to the waters of
   life, even to Jesus Christ, where they may have bread, fatness, what is
   good, and will satisfy that their painful thirst, (John 4:14, 6:35).

   [205] That is, in such a manner as it shall be true evangelical
   repentance, a gracious humiliation, sorrow and turning, acceptable in
   the sight of God. This question [grounded on Nomista's pretending that
   Neophytus had no warrant to believe, unless he had truly repented]
   supposes that there is a kind of repentance, humiliation, sorrow for
   sin, and turning from it, which goes before faith, but that they are
   not "after a godly sort," as the apostle's phrase is, (2 Cor 7:11).

   [206] I think it nothing strange to find the author so very peremptory
   in this point, which is of greater weight than many are aware of. True
   repentance is a turning unto God, a coming back to him again; a
   returning even unto the Lord, according to an usual Old Testament
   phrase, found, (Hosea 14:1), and rightly so translated, (Isa 19:22).
   But no man can come unto God "but by Christ"; (Heb 7:25), "He is able
   also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God BY HIM."--(John
   14:6), "No man cometh unto the Father but BY ME." We must take Christ
   in our way to the Father, else it is impossible that we guilty
   creatures can reach unto him. and no man can come unto Christ, but by
   believing in him, (John 6:35), therefore it is impossible that a man
   can truly repent before he believe in Christ. "Him hath God exalted
   with his right hand, to be a Prince [or leader] and a Saviour, for to
   give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins," (Acts 5:31). One
   would think this to be a sufficient intimation, that sinners not only
   may, but ought to go to him for true repentance; and not stand off from
   him until they get it to bring along with them; especially since
   repentance, as well as remission of sin, is a part of that salvation,
   which he as a Saviour is exalted to give, and consequently, which
   sinners are to receive and rest upon him for; and likewise that it is
   that by which he, as a leader, doth lead back sinners even unto God,
   from whom they were led away in the first Adam, the head of the
   apostasy. And if one inquires anent the way of his giving repentance to
   Israel, the prophet Zechariah showed it before to be by faith, (Zech
   12:10), "And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they
   shall mourn."

   [207] This the Scripture teacheth, determining in the general, that
   without faith one can do nothing acceptable in the sight of God, (John
   15:5), "Without me," i.e. separate from me, "ye can do nothing."--(Heb
   11:6), "Without faith it is impossible to please him": and particularly
   with respect to this case, (Luke 7:37-47), "And behold a woman in the
   city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat, stood
   at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears,
   and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet. And
   he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon: Her sins which are many,
   are forgiven, for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the
   same loveth little."--It is an argument gathered of the effects
   following, whereby anything is proved by signs ensuring. Calvin. Inst.
   lib. 3. cap. 4. sect 37.

   [208] There is a knowledge in faith, as our divines teach against the
   Papists, and the Scripture maketh manifest. (Isa 53:11), "By his
   knowledge shall my righteous Servant justify many."--(Heb 11:3),
   "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of
   God." Now, saving faith being a persuasion that we shall have life and
   salvation by Christ, or a receiving and resting on him for salvation,
   includes in it a knowledge of our being beloved for God: the former
   cannot be without the latter. In the meantime, such as the strength or
   weakness of that persuasion is, the steadiness or unsteadiness of that
   receiving and resting, just so is this knowledge, clear or unclear,
   free of, or accompanied with doubtings. They are still of the same
   measure and degree. So that this is no more in effect, but that faith
   in Christ is the spring of true love to God; the which, how it is
   attained by a guilty soul, men will the better know, if they consider
   well what it is. The true love of God is not a love to him only for his
   benefits, and for our own sake, but a love to him for himself, for his
   own sake; a liking of, and a complacency in, his glorious attributes
   and perfections, his infinite, eternal and unchangeable being, wisdom,
   power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth. If a convinced sinner is
   void of any the least measure of persuasion of life and salvation by
   Christ, and of the love of this God to him; but apprehends, as he
   cannot miss to do in this case, that he hates him as his enemy, and
   will prove so at last; this cannot fail of filling his whole soul with
   slavish fear of God; and how then shall this love of God spring up in
   one's heart, in such a case? for slavish fear and true love are so
   opposite the one to the other, that, according to the measure in which
   the one prevails, the other cannot have access. (2 Tim 1:7), "God hath
   not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a sound
   mind." (1 John 4:18), "There is no fear in love, but perfect love
   casteth out fear; because fear hath torment." But when once life and
   salvation, and remission of sin, is with application believed by the
   convinced sinner, and thereby the love of God towards him is known;
   then, according to the measure of that faith and knowledge, slavish
   fear of God is expelled, and the heart is kindly drawn to love him, not
   only for his benefits, but for himself, having a complacency in his
   glorious perfections. "We love him, because he first loved us," (1 John
   4:19). The love of God to us is the inducement of our love to him: but
   love utterly unknown to the party beloved can never be an inducement to
   him to love again. Now, in consequence hereof, the sinner's bands are
   loosed, and his heart, which before was still hard as a stone, though
   broken in pieces by legal terrors, is broken in another manner,
   softened, and kindly melted in sorrow for displeasing this gracious
   God.

   [209] God's turning of a sinner first brings him to Christ, (John
   6:44,45), "No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath sent
   me draw him." And then he comes to God by Christ, (John 14:26), "No man
   cometh unto the Father but by me."

   [210] In a right manner, in the manner immediately after mentioned.

   [211] Faith cometh of the word of God; hope cometh of faith; and
   charity springeth of them both. Faith believes that word; hope trusteth
   after that which is promised by the word; and charity doth good unto
   her neighbour. Mr. Patrick Hamilton's Articles in Knox's Hist. p. 11.

   [212] Not as that they are pardoned already; but that one must so
   apprehend the favour of God, as to believe that God will pardon his
   sin, as the author speaks expressly in the premises from whence this
   conclusion is drawn; or that God doth pardon his sin in the present
   time. See note, chap. 3, sect. 6. Now, remission of sin is a part of
   that salvation which faith receives and rests on Christ for. As for the
   phrase the author uses to express this, it is most agreeable to the
   Scripture phrase, "Remission of sins preached," (Luke 24:47, Acts
   13:38).

   [213] Namely, such an alteration as is pleasing and acceptable in the
   sight of God, the which he has described in the preceding sentence.
   Otherwise, he has already taught us, that there are notable alterations
   of life and conversation which do not proceed from faith; and therefore
   are not accepted of God. And of these we shall hear more anon. It will
   not be amiss here to observe how our author, in his account of the
   relation betwixt faith and repentance, treads in the ancient paths,
   according to his manner. "It ought to be out of question," says Calvin,
   "that repentance doth not only immediately follow faith, but also
   spring out of it. As for them that think that repentance doth rather go
   before faith, than flow or spring forth of it, as a fruit out of a
   tree, they never knew the force thereof, and are moved with too weak an
   argument, to think so. Christ and John, [say they] in their preachings,
   first exhort the people to repentance, &c. A man cannot earnestly apply
   himself to repentance, unless he know himself to be of God: but no man
   is truly persuaded that he is of God, but he that hath first received
   his grace. No man shall ever reverently fear God, but he that trusteth
   that God is merciful to him: no man will willingly prepare himself to
   the keeping of the law, but he that is persuaded that his services
   please him." Instit. b. 3. chap. 3. sec. 1, 2. "How soon that ever the
   Spirit of the Lord Jesus, which God's elect children receive by true
   faith, takes possession in the heart of any man, so soon doth he
   regenerate and renew the same man. So that he begins to hate that which
   before he loved, and begins to love that which before he hated; and
   from thence comes that continual battle which is betwixt the flesh and
   the spirit." Old Confess. art. 13. "Being in Christ, we must be new
   creatures--so that we must hate and flee that which before we loved and
   embraced, and we must love and follow that which before we hated and
   abhorred. All which is impossible to them that have no faith, and have
   but a dead faith." Mr. John Davidson's Cat. p. 29. "Quest. When I shall
   ask you then, What is craved of us, after that we are joined to Christ
   by faith, and made truly righteous in him? ye shall answer. A. We must
   repent and become new persons, that we may show forth the virtues of
   him that hath called us." Ibid. p. 35. "What is thy repentance? The
   effect of this faith, working a sorrow for my sins by-past, and purpose
   to amend in time to come." Mr. James Melvil's Cat. in his Propine, &c.
   p. 44. "Repentance unto life is a saving grace, whereby a sinner out of
   a true sense of his sin, and apprehension of the mercy of God in
   Christ, doth with grief and hatred of sin, turn from it unto God."
   Shorter Cat. "M. This is then thy saying, That unto the time that God
   hath received us to mercy, and regenerated us by his Spirit, we can do
   nothing but sin; even as an evil tree can bring forth no fruit but that
   which is evil, (Matt 7:17). C. Even so it is." Calvin's Cat. quest.
   117. "He doth receive us into his favour, of his bountiful mercy,
   through the merits of our Saviour Christ, accounting his righteousness
   to be ours, and for his sake imputeth not our faults unto us." Ibid.
   quest. 118. "Quest. What is the first fruit of this union? [namely of
   union with Christ by faith]. A. A remission of our sins, and imputation
   of justice. Q. Which is the next fruit of our union with him? A. Our
   sanctification and regeneration to the image of God." Craig's Cat. q.
   24, 25. "Q. What is sanctification? A. Sanctification is a work of
   God's grace, whereby they are renewed in their whole man, after the
   image of God, having the seeds of repentance unto life, and of all
   other saving graces, put into their hearts." Larger Cat. quest. 75. "We
   would beware of Mr. Baxter's order of setting repentance and works of
   new obedience before justification, which is indeed a new covenant of
   works." Rutherford's Influences of the Life of Grace, p. 346.

   [214] This is taken word for word out of the English Annotations of
   Matthew 3:2; which are cited for it by our author under the name of the
   Last Annotations, because they were printed in the year 1645, about
   which time this book also was first published. How the author applies
   it, will appear anon.

   [215] The word rendered repent, is, "To change one's mind, and to lay
   aside false opinions, which they had drunk in, whether from the
   Pharisees, concerning the righteousness of works, traditions, worship,
   &c.; or from the Sadducees, concerning the resurrection," &c. Lucus
   Brugensis, apud Pol. Synop. Crit. in Matthew 3:2.

   [216] That the reader may further see how little weight there is in the
   objection raised from Mark 1:15, I subjoin the words of two learned
   commentators on the text. "Repent ye, turn from the wickedness of your
   ways and believe. There is a repentance that must go before faith, that
   is, the applicative of the promise of pardoning mercy to the soul;
   though true evangelical repentance, which is a sorrow for sin, flowing
   from the sense of the love of God in Christ, be the fruit and effect of
   faith." Contin. of Poole's Annot. on the place.--"Faith or believing,
   in order of the work of grace, is before repentance, that being the
   first and mother grace of all others; yet is here and in other places,
   named the latter: first, because though faith be first wrought, yet
   repentance is first seen and evidenced," &c. Lightfoot's Harmony, part
   3. p. 164. 4to.

   [217] That is, his repentance is true in its kind, though not saving.
   There is a change of his mind and heart, in that, upon a conviction, he
   turns from profanity to strictness of life, and upon farther
   conviction, from a conceit of his own righteousness to a desire after
   the righteousness of Christ: nevertheless, all this is but selfish, and
   cannot please God while the man is void of faith, (Heb 11:6).

   [218] His conviction of his lost and undone state was before
   represented in its proper place. After much disputing whether such a
   vile and sinful wretch as he had any warrant to come to Christ, he
   appears, in his immediately foregoing speech, to be so far enlightened
   in the knowledge of Christ, that he is verily persuaded that Christ is
   willing to entertain him; and to have his heart and will so overcome by
   divine grace, that he is willing to come unto Christ: yet, after all,
   he, through weakness of judgment, apprehends himself to want power to
   believe; whereas it is by these very means that a soul is persuaded,
   and enabled too, to believe in Jesus Christ. Hereupon the author,
   waving the dispute anent his power to believe, wisely asks him, If he
   is resolved to put forth the power he has? forasmuch as it was evident
   from the account given of the present condition of his soul that it had
   felt "a day of power," (Psa 110:3), and that he was "drawn of the
   Father, and, therefore, could come to Christ," (John 6:44). For
   "effectual calling is the work of God's Spirit, whereby, convincing us
   of our sin and misery, enlightening our minds in the knowledge of
   Christ, and renewing our wills, he doth persuade and enable us to
   embrace Jesus Christ." Shorter Catechism.--"Savingly enlightening their
   minds, renewing and powerfully determining their wills, so as they are
   hereby made willing and able." Larg. Cat. quest. 67.

   [219] See the foregoing note. This is the concluding point in this
   matter; the man being drawn by efficacious grace, though he is not
   without doubts and fears as to the event, yet is no more in doubt,
   whether to embrace the offer or not. And the inward motion of his heart
   breaking through the remaining doubts and fears, after a long struggle,
   unto Jesus Christ, in the free promise, being in itself indiscernible,
   but to God and one's own soul, it is agreeably enough to one's way in
   that case: discovered in that expression of a conquered soul, Now am I
   resolved to go unto Christ, now am I determined to believe; the which
   cannot but present to him who deals with the exercised person, the
   whole soul going out unto Jesus Christ. Hence the match may justly
   thereupon be declared to be made, as our author does in the words
   immediately following. Thus Job, in his distress, expresseth his faith,
   (Job 13:15), "Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him." Compare
   (Acts 11:33), "That with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the
   Lord."

   [220] In possession.

   [221] That is, you need not, holding back your hand, stand disputing
   with yourself how you will get power; but with the power given, stretch
   forth the withered hand, and Christ will strengthen it, and enable you
   to take a firm hold. (John 12:32), "And I, if I be lifted up from the
   earth, will draw all men unto me."--(Isa 40:29), "He giveth power to
   the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength."

   [222] The power here mentioned, seems rather to denote right or
   privilege [as the original word is rendered in the margin of our
   Bibles] than strength or ability.

   [223] That is, an union with the whole Christ, God-Man; (1 Cor 6:17),
   "He that is joined to the Lord, is one spirit."--(Eph 5:38), "For we
   are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."

   [224] Jesus Christ and the believer, being one person in the eye of the
   law, there is no separating of them in law, in point of life and death.
   (John 14:19), "Because I live, ye shall live also." I have adventured
   this once to add one syllable to the text of the author; and so to read
   "condemned" for "damned." The words are of the same signification;
   only, the latter has an idea of horror affixed to it, which the former
   has not; and which perhaps it had not either, in the days of our
   forefathers, when godly Tindal used the expression, as our author
   informs us. And I take this liberty, the rather that a like expression
   of John Careless, in a letter to William Tyms, seems to me to run more
   smooth, by means of the same addition, though I doubt if the word stood
   so in the original copy. "Christ," says he, "is made unto us holiness,
   righteousness, and justification; he hath clothed us in all his merits
   and taken to himself all our sin--so that, if any should be now
   condemned for the same, it must needs be Jesus Christ, who hath taken
   them upon him." The Sufferer's Mirror, p. 66. And in the Old Confession
   of Faith, art. 9, according to the ancient copies, it is said, "The
   clean, innocent Lamb of God was damned in the presence of an earthly
   judge, that we should be absolved before the tribunal seat of our God."
   But in the copy standing in Knox's History, reprinted at Edinburgh,
   anno 1644, it is read "condemned."

   [225] This gift would indeed be a very unsuitable return, for all the
   benefits received from Christ by virtue of the spiritual marriage, if
   he did not deal with us in the way of free grace; like unto a physician
   who desires nothing of a poor man full of sores, but that he will
   employ him in the cure of them. But this gift, such as it is, as it is
   all we have of our own to give, so one needs make no question but it
   will be very acceptable, (Psa 55:22), "Cast thy burden upon the Lord,
   and he shall sustain thee"; not only thy burden of duty, suffering, and
   success, but of sin too, wherewith thou art heavy laden, (Matt 11:28).
   We are allowed, not only to give him our burden, but to cast it upon
   him. He knows very well that all these evils mentioned, and many more,
   are in the heart of the best: yet doth he say, (Prov 23:26), "My son,
   give me thine heart"; notwithstanding of the wretched stuff he knows to
   be in it. In the language of the Holy Ghost, these things, black as
   they are, are a gift by divine appointment to be given, (Lev 16:21):
   speaking of the scape-goat, an eminent type of Christ, he says, "And
   Aaron shall confess over him all the iniquities of the children of
   Israel, and all their transgressions, and all their sins: and he shall
   give them upon the head of the goat." Thus the original expresses what
   we read, "putting them," &c. Now, the end for which the sinner is to
   give these to Christ is twofold: (1.) For removing of the guilt of
   them. (2.) For the mortifying of them. And though this is not an easy
   way of mortification, since the way of believing is not easy, but more
   difficult than all the Popish austerities, forasmuch as these last are
   more agreeable to nature, yet indeed it is the short way to
   mortification, because it is the only way; without which, the practice
   of all other directions will be but as so many ciphers, without a
   figure standing at their head, signifying nothing, for true Christian
   mortification. (Acts 15:9), "Purifying their hearts by faith."--(Rom
   6:6), "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him." And
   (8:13), "If ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye
   shall live."--(Gal 5:24), "And they that are Christ's, have crucified
   the flesh, with the affections and lusts; namely, nailing them to the
   cross of Christ by faith."

   [226] Thus, namely, by the giving of our sins to him, not by believers,
   but by his Father, as says the text, "He [not we] made him to be sin
   for us." Nevertheless, the Lord's laying our iniquities upon Christ is
   good warrant for every believer to give his sins in particular upon
   him; the latter being a cordial falling in with, a practical
   approbation, and taking the benefit of the former.

   [227] Namely, by doing perfectly what it demanded to be done, by virtue
   of its commanding power, and suffering completely what it demanded to
   be borne, by virtue of its condemning power.

   [228] Although believers in the first moment of their union with Christ
   by faith, are delivered from the law, as it is the covenant of works,
   and therefore their after sins neither are, nor can be, formally
   transgressions of that covenant; yet they are interpretatively so,
   giving a plain proof of what they would have done against that
   covenant, had they been under it still. And forasmuch as they could
   never have been freed from it, had not the glorious Mediator wrought
   their deliverance, by fulfilling it in their room and stead; all their
   sins whatsoever, from their birth to their death, after as well as
   before their union with Christ, were charged upon him, as
   transgressions against that covenant; and such as are pardoned to them
   in their justification. Even as he who redeems a slave must pay in
   proportion to the service which it is supposed he would have done his
   master during life; and the slave is loosed from all obligation to
   these several pieces of service unto that master, upon the ransom paid,
   in compensation of all and every one of them. And thus our author says,
   that a believer, in his justification, is acquitted from all his
   transgressions against the covenant of works, not only past and
   present, but to come. So that he leaves no ground to question, but
   Christ satisfied for all the sins of believers whatsoever, whether in
   their state of regeneracy or unregeneracy. Nor does he make the least
   insinuation, that the sins of believers, after their union with Christ,
   are not properly transgressions of that law which was [yea, and to
   unbelievers still is] in the covenant of works: but, on the contrary,
   expressly teaches, that it is the very same law of the ten commands
   which is the law of Christ, and which the believer transgresseth, that
   was and is in the covenant of works. And although the revenging wrath
   of God and eternal death are not threatened against the sins of
   believers after their union with Christ; and that for this one reason,
   That that wrath and that death [the eternity whereof rose not from the
   nature of the thing, but the infirmity of the sufferer, and therefore
   could have no place in the Son of God] were not only threatened before,
   but executed too upon their surety Jesus Christ, to whom they are
   united: it is manifest, that there was great need of Christ's being
   made a curse for these sins of believers, as well as for those
   preceding their union with him.

   [229] "The sentence of justification was, as it were, conceived in the
   mind of God by the decree of justifying, (Gal 3:8), 'The Scripture
   foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith.'" Ames.

   Christ before the world began." (2 Tim 1:9) Turret. loc. 16. q. 9. th.

   Rutherford adds, "It is one thing for a man to be justified in Christ,
   and that from eternity: and another for a man to be justified in Christ
   in time, according to the gospel-covenant. Faith is not so much as the
   instrument of eternal and immanent justification and remission of
   sins." Ibid. p. 55.

   [230] "Justification may be considered as to the execution of it in
   time; and that again, either as to the purchase of it, which was made
   by the death of Christ on the cross, concerning which it is said, (Rom
   5:9,10), 'That we are justified and reconciled to God by the blood of
   Christ; and that Christ reconciled all things unto God by the blood of
   the cross,' (Col 1:20). And elsewhere, Christ is said to be 'raised
   again for our justification,' (Rom 4:25). Because, as in him dying, we
   died, so in him raised again and justified, we are justified; that is,
   we have a certain and undoubted pledge and foundation of our
   justification. Or as to the application of it," &c. Turret. ubi sup.
   "The sentence of justification was pronounced in Christ our head, risen
   from the dead," (2 Cor 5:19). Ames, ubi sup.â?""We were virtually
   justified, especially when Christ having finished the purchase of our
   salvation, was justified, and we in him as our head," (1 Tim 3:16, 2

   elect man, effectually called, and so apprehended of Christ, apprehends
   Christ again," (Rom 8:30). Essen. ubi supra.â?""The sentence of
   justification is pronounced virtually from that first relation which
   ariseth from faith," (Rom 8:1). Ames. ubi supra.
   Upon the whole, it is evident our author keeps the path trodden by
   orthodox divines on the subject; and though, in order to answer the
   objections of his adversary, he uses the school terms, of being
   justified in respect of God's decree, meritoriously, and actually,
   agreeably to the practice of other sound divines; yet otherwise he
   begins and ends his decision of this controversy, by asserting in plain
   and simple terms, without any distinction at all, "That a man is not
   justified before he believes, or without faith." So his answer amounts
   just to this, "That God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all
   the elect; and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins,
   and rise again for their justification nevertheless, they are not
   justified, until the Holy Spirit doth in due time actually apply Christ
   unto them." Westm. Confess. cap. 11. art. 4.

   [232] Concerning the deliverance from the law, which, according to the
   Scripture, is the privilege of believers purchased unto them by Jesus
   Christ, there are two opinions equally contrary to the word of God, and
   to one another. The one of the Legalist, That believers are under the
   law, even as it is the covenant of works; the other of the Antinomian,
   That believers are not at all under the law, no, not as it is a rule of
   life. Betwixt these extremes, both of them destructive of true holiness
   and gospel-obedience, our author, with other orthodox divines, holds
   the middle path; asserting [and in the proper place proving] that
   believers are under the law, as a rule of life, but free from it as it
   is the covenant of works. To be delivered from the law as it is the
   covenant of works, is no more but to be delivered from the covenant of
   works. And the asserting, that believers are delivered from the law as
   it is the covenant of works, doth necessarily import, that they are
   under the law, in some other respects thereto contra- distinguished.
   And forasmuch as the author teaches, that believers are under the law,
   as it is the law of Christ, and a rule of life to them, it is
   reasonable to conclude that to be it. He must needs, under the term,
   "the covenant of works," understand and comprehend the law of the ten
   commandments; because no man, understanding what the covenant of works
   is, can speak of it, but he must, under that term, understand and
   comprehend the ten commandments, even as none can speak of a man, with
   knowledge of a sense of that word, but under that term must understand
   and comprehend an organic body, as well as a soul. But it is manifest,
   that the law of the ten commandments, without the form of the covenant
   of works upon it, is not the thing he understands by that term, "the
   covenant of works." Neither is the form of the covenant of works [which
   is no more the covenant itself, than the soul without the body is the
   man] essential to the ten commandments, so that they cannot be without
   it. If it be said, that the author, by the covenant of works,
   understands the moral law, as it is defined, [Larg. Cat. q. 92,] it is
   granted; but then it amounts to no more, but that, by the covenant of
   works, he understands the covenant of works; for by the moral law
   there, is understood the covenant of works, as has been already
   evinced. The doctrine of believers' freedom from the covenant of works,
   or from the law as that covenant, is of the greatest importance, and is
   expressly taught. [Larg. Cat. q. 97.] "they that are regenerate, and
   believe in Christ, be delivered from the moral law, as a covenant of
   works," (Rom 6:14, 7:4,6, Gal 4:4,5) West. confess. chap. 19, art.
   6.--"True believers be not under the law as a covenant of works." To
   these I subjoin one testimony, from the Prac. Use of Saving Knowledge,
   tit. "For Strengthening the Man's Faith," &c. Romans 7, fig. 3, "Albeit
   the apostle himself [brought in here for example's cause] and all other
   true believers in Christ, be by nature under the law of sin and death,
   or under the covenant of works; [called the law of sin and death,
   because it bindeth sin and death upon us, till Christ set us free;] yet
   the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, or the covenant of
   grace, [so called because it doth enable and quicken a man to a
   spiritual life through Christ,] doth set the apostle, and all true
   believers, free from the covenant of works, or the law of sin and
   death." See more, ibid. fig. 4. As also tit. "For convincing a man of
   Judgment by the Law," par. 2, and last. And tit. "Evidences of true
   Faith." And tit. "For the First," &c. fig. 4. Now, delivering from a
   covenant being the dissolution of a relation which admits not of
   degrees, believers being delivered from the covenant of works, must be
   wholly and altogether set free from it. This appears also from the
   believers' being dead to it, and it dead to him, of which before at
   large. There is a twofold death competent to a believer with respect to
   the law, as it is the covenant of works; and so to the law as such,
   with respect to the believer. (1.) The believer is dead to it really,
   and in point of duty, while he carries himself as one who is dead to
   it. And this I take to be comprehended in that saying of the apostle,
   (Gal 2:19), "I through the law am dead to the law." In the best of the
   children of God here, there are such remains of the legal disposition
   and inclination of heart to the way of the covenant of works, that as
   they are never quite free of it in their best duties, so at sometimes
   their services smell so rank of it, as if they were alive to the law,
   and still dead to Christ. And sometimes the Lord for their correction,
   trial, and exercise of faith, suffers the ghost of the dead husband,
   the law, as a covenant of works, to come in upon their souls and make
   demands on them, command, threaten, and affright them, as if they were
   alive to it, and it to them. And it is one of the hardest pieces of
   practical religion, to be dead to the law in such cases. This death to
   it admits of degrees, is not alike in all believers, and is perfect in
   none till the death of the body. But of this kind of death to the law,
   the question proceeds not here. (2.) The believer is dead to it
   relatively, and in point of privilege; the relation betwixt him and it
   is dissolved, even as the relation between a husband and wife is
   dissolved by death; (Rom 7:4), "Wherefore, my brethren ye also are
   become dead to the law, by the body of Christ, that ye should be
   married to another." This can admit of no degrees, but it is perfect in
   all believers; so that they are wholly and altogether set free from it,
   in point of privilege, upon which the question here proceeds, and in
   this respect they can expect neither good nor hurt from it.

   [233] "Believers be not under the law, as a covenant of works, to be
   thereby justified or condemned." Westm. Confess. chap. 19. art. 6.

   [234] From the general conclusion already laid down and proved, namely,
   That believers are wholly and altogether set free from the covenant of
   works, or from the law as it is that covenant, this necessarily
   follows. But to consider particulars, for further clearing of this
   weighty point, (1.) That the covenant of works hath no power to justify
   a sinner, in regard to his utter inability to pay the penalty, and to
   fulfil the condition of it, is clear from the apostle's testimony, (Rom
   8:3), "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the
   flesh, God sending his own Son," &c. (2.) That the believer is not
   under the condemning power of it, appears from Galatians 3:13, "Christ
   hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for
   us."--(Rom 8:1), "There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them
   which are in Christ Jesus."--(verse 33,34), "It is God that justifieth;
   who is he that condemneth?" (3.) As to its commanding power, believers
   are not under it neither; for, 1. Its commanding and condemning power,
   in case of transgression, are inseparable; for by the sentence of that
   covenant, every breaker of its commands is bound over to death; (Gal
   3:10), "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are
   written in the book of the law, to do them."--"And whatsoever it saith,
   it saith to them that are under it," (Rom 3:19), Therefore, if
   believers are under its commanding power, they must needs be under its
   condemning power, yea, and actually bound over to death; forasmuch as
   they are, without question, breakers of its commands, if they be indeed
   under its commanding power. 2. If, as to any set of men, the justifying
   and condemning power be removed from that law which God gave to Adam as
   a covenant of works, and to all mankind in him, then the covenant form
   of that law is done away as to them; so that there is not a covenant of
   works in being unto them, to have a commanding power over them; but
   such is the case of believers, that law can neither justify them, nor
   condemn them; therefore, there is no covenant of works in being betwixt
   God and them, to have a commanding power over them; our Lord Jesus
   "blotted out the hand-writing, took it out of the way, nailing it to
   his cross," (Col 2:14). 3. Believers are dead to the law, as it is the
   covenant of works, and "married to another," (Rom 7:4). Therefore they
   are set free from the commanding power of the first husband, the
   covenant of works. 4. They are not under it; (Rom 6:14), "Ye are not
   under the law, but under grace": how then can it have a commanding
   power over them? 5. The consideration of the nature of the commands of
   the covenant of works may sufficiently clear this point. Its commands
   bind to perfect obedience, under the pain of the curse, which, on every
   slip, is bound upon the transgressor; (Gal 3:10), "Cursed is every one
   who continueth not in all things," &c. But Christ hath redeemed
   believers from the curse, (verse 13), and the law they are under speaks
   in softer terms, (Psa 89:31,32), "If they break my statutes, then will
   I visit their transgression with the rod," &c. Moreover, it commands
   obedience upon the ground of the strength to perform, given to mankind
   in Adam, which is now gone, and affords no new strength; for there is
   no promise of strength for duty belonging to the covenant of works: and
   to state believers under the covenant of works, to receive commands for
   their duty, and under the covenant of grace, for the promise of
   strength to perform, looks very unlike to the beautiful order of the
   dispensation of grace, held forth to us in the word; (Rom 6:14), "Ye
   are not under the law, but under grace." Lastly. Our Lord Jesus put
   himself under the commanding power of the covenant of works, and gave
   it perfect obedience, to deliver his people from under it; (Gal 4:4,5),
   "God sent forth his son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem
   them that were under the law." That they then should put their necks
   under that yoke again, cannot but be highly dishonouring "to this
   crucified Christ, who disarmed the law of its thunders, defaced the
   obligation of it as a covenant, and, as it were, grinded the stones
   upon which it was wrought to powder." Charnock, vol. 2. q. 531.

   [235] And therefore since there is no covenant of works [or law of
   works, as it is called, (Rom 3:27),] betwixt God and the believer, it
   is manifest there can be no transgressing of it, in their case. God
   requires obedience of believers, and not only threatens them, gives
   them angry words and looks, but brings heavy judgments on them for
   their disobedience; but the promise of strength, and penalty of
   fatherly wrath only, annexed to the commands requiring obedience of
   them, and the anger of God against them, purged of the curse, do
   evidently discover, that none of these come to them, in the channel of
   the covenant of works.

   [236] And though all the sins of believers are not sins of daily
   infirmity, yet they are all sins of frailty; (Gal 5:17), "For the flesh
   lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh, so that
   ye cannot do the things that ye would";--(Rom 7:19), "The evil which I
   would not, that I do." See chapter 5:15, 17, and 6:12.

   [237] Thus far of the believer's complete deliverance from the covenant
   of works, or from the law, namely, as it is the covenant of works.
   Follows the practical use to be made of it by the believer. And, 1. In
   hearing of the word.

   [238] Though they are God's own sayings, found in his written word, and
   spoken by his servants, as having commission from him for that effect;
   yet, forasmuch as they are the language of the law, as it is the
   covenant of works, they are directed only to those who are under that
   covenant, (Rom 3:19), and not to believers, who are not under it.

   [239] And to believers he hath given eternal life already, according to
   the Scripture.

   [240] Follows, II. The use of it, in conflicts of conscience with the
   law in its demands, sin in its guilt, Satan in his accusations, death
   in its terrors.

   [241] He begins with the conflict with the law; for, as the apostle
   teaches, "the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the
   law," (1 Cor 15:56). While the law retains its power over a man, death
   has its sting, and sin its strength against him; but if once he is dead
   to the law, wholly and altogether set free from it, as it is the
   covenant of works; then sin hath lost its strength, death its sting,
   and Satan his plea against him. That the author still speaks of the law
   as it is the covenant of works, from the commanding and condemning
   power of which believers are delivered, and no otherwise, cannot
   reasonably be questioned, since he is still pursuing the practical use
   of the doctrine anent it as such; and having before spoken of it as
   acting by commission from God he treats of it here, as acting, as it
   were, of its own proper motion, and not by any such commission. To
   those who are under the law, the law speaks its demands and terrors, as
   sent from God: but to believers, who are not under it, it cannot so
   speak, but of itself. (Rom 8:15), "For ye have not received the spirit
   of bondage again to fear." Now, in the conflict the believer has with
   the law or covenant of works, the author puts two cases; in which the
   conscience needs to be soundly directed, as in cases of the utmost
   weight. The first case is this, The law attempting to exercise its
   condemning power over him, accusing him of transgression, demands of
   him satisfaction to the justice of God for his sin, and threatens to
   hale him to execution. In this case, the author dare not advise the
   afflicted to say, with the servant in the parable, (Matt 18:26), "Have
   patience with me, and I will pay thee all"; but he teaches him to
   devolve his burden wholly upon his surety: he bids him plead, that
   since "he is married to Christ," whatever action the law may pretend to
   be competent to it, for the satisfaction of justice, upon the account
   of his sin, it must lie betwixt the law and Christ, the husband; but
   that, in very deed, there remains no place for such action, forasmuch
   as, through Jesus Christ's suffering and satisfying to the full, he is
   set free from the law, and owes nothing to justice nor to the law upon
   that score. If any man will venture to deal in other terms with the law
   in this case, his experience will at length sufficiently discover his
   mistake. Now it is manifest that this relates to the case of
   justification.

   [242] Here is the second case, namely, the law attempting to exercise
   its commanding power over the believer, requires him to do good works,
   and to keep the commandments, if he will obtain salvation. This comes
   in natively in the second place. The author could not, reasonably, rest
   satisfied with the believer's being delivered from the curse of the
   covenant of works, from the debt owing to divine justice, according to
   its penal sanction; if he had, he would have left the afflicted still
   in the lurch, in the point of justification, and of inheriting eternal
   life: he would have proposed Christ to him only as a half saviour, and
   left as much of the law's plea behind without an answer as would have
   concluded him incapable of being justified before God, and made an heir
   of eternal life; for the law, as it is the covenant of works, being
   broken, has a twofold demand on the sinner, each of which must be
   answered, before he can be justified. The one is a demand of
   satisfaction for sin, arising from, and according to its penal
   sanction: this demand was made in the preceding case, and solidly
   answered. But there remains yet another, namely, the demand of perfect
   obedience, arising from, and according to the settled condition of that
   covenant; and the afflicted must have wherewith to answer it also;
   otherwise he shall still sink in the deep mire, where there is no
   standing. For as no judge can absolve a man, merely on his having paid
   the penalty of a broken contract, to which he was obliged, by and
   attour the fulfilling of the condition, so no man can be justified
   before God, nor have a right to life, till this demand of the law be
   also satisfied in his case. Then, and not till then, is the law's mouth
   stopped in point of his justification. Thus Adam, before his fall, was
   free from the curse; yet neither was, nor could be justified and
   entitled to life, until he had run the course of his obedience,
   prescribed him by the law as a covenant of works. Accordingly, we are
   taught that "God justifies sinners, not only by imputing the
   satisfaction, but also the obedience of Christ unto them" Westm.
   Confess. chap. 11. art. 1. And that "justification is an act of God's
   free grace, wherein he not only pardoneth all our sins, but accepteth
   us as righteous in his sight." Short. Cat. Here then is the second
   demand of the law, namely, the demand of perfect obedience, respecting
   the case of justification, no less than the demand of satisfaction for
   sin. And it is proposed in such terms as the Scripture uses to express
   the self-same thing. (Luke 10:28), "This do, and thou shalt
   live."--(Matt 19:17), "If thou wilt enter into life, keep the
   commandments." In both which passages our Lord proposeth this demand of
   the covenant of works, for the conviction of the proud legalists with
   whom he there had to do. And the truth is, that the terms in which this
   demand stands here conceived, are so very agreeable to the style and
   language of the covenant of works expressed in these texts, and
   elsewhere, that the law, without receding in the least from the
   propriety of expression, might have addressed innocent Adam, in the
   very same terms; changing only the word salvation into life, because he
   was not yet miserable; and so saying to him, Good works must be done,
   and the commandments must be kept, if thou wilt obtain life. What
   impropriety there could have been in this saying, while as yet there
   was no covenant known in the world, but the covenant of works, I see
   not. Even innocent Adam was not, by his works, to obtain life, in the
   way of proper merit; but in virtue of compact only. Now, this being the
   case, one may plainly perceive, that in the true answer to it, there
   can be no place for bringing in any holiness, righteousness, good
   works, and keeping of the commandments, but Christ's only; for nothing
   else can satisfy this demand of the law. And if a believer should
   acknowledge the necessity of his own holiness and good works, in this
   point, and so set about them, in order to answer this demand; then he
   should grossly and abominably pervert the end for which the Lord
   requires them of him; putting his own holiness and obedience in the
   room of Christ's imputed obedience; and so should fix himself in the
   mire out of which he could never escape, until he gave over that way
   and betook himself again to what Christ alone has done for satisfying
   this demand of the law. But that the excluding of our holiness,
   good-works, and keeping of the commandments, from any part in this
   matter, militates nothing against the absolute necessity of holiness in
   its proper place, [without which, in men's own persons, no man shall
   see the Lord,] is a point too clear among sound Protestant divines, to
   be here insisted upon. And hence our author could not instruct
   Neophytus to say, in this conflict with the law or covenant of works,
   "It is my sincere resolution, in the strength of grace, to follow peace
   with all men, and holiness." Neither would any sound Protestant divine
   have put such an answer into the mouth of the afflicted in this case;
   knowing that our evangelical holiness and good works [suppose we could
   attain unto them before justification] would be rejected by the law, as
   filthy rags; forasmuch as the law acknowledges no holiness, no good
   works, no keeping of the commandments, but what is every way perfect,
   and will never be satisfied with sincere resolutions, to do, in the
   strength of grace to be given; but requires doing in perfection, in the
   strength of grace given already, (Gal 3:10). Therefore our author sends
   the afflicted unto Jesus Christ, the surety for all that is demanded of
   him by the law or covenant of works: and teaches him in this case, to
   plead Christ's works, and keeping of the commands; and this is the only
   safe way, which all true Christians will find themselves obliged to
   take at the long run, in this conflict. The difficulty raised on this
   head is owing to that anti-scriptural principle, "That believers are
   under the commanding power of the covenant of works"; which is
   overthrown before. The case itself, and the answer to it at large, is
   taken from Luther's Sermon of the Lost Sheep, pp. 77, 78, and Sermon
   upon the Hymn of Zacharias, p. 50.

   [243] Saved, namely, really, though not perfectly; even as a drowning
   man is saved when his head is got above the water, and he, leaning on
   his deliverer, is making towards the shore; in this case, the believer
   has no more need of the law, or covenant of works, than such a man has
   of one, who, to save him, would lay a weight upon him, that would make
   him sink again beneath the stream. Observe the manner of speaking and
   reasoning used on this head. (Titus 3:5), "Not by works of
   righteousness, which we have DONE, but according to his mercy, he SAVED
   us, by the washing of REGENERATION, and RENEWING of the Holy
   Ghost."--(Eph 2:8-10), "For by grace ARE YE SAVED, through faith, not
   of WORKS, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship,
   created in Christ Jesus, UNTO good works." Here (1.) It is undeniable,
   especially according to the original words, that the apostle asserts
   believers to be saved already. (2.) Denying that we are saved by works
   which we have done, he plainly enough intimates, that we are saved by
   the works which Christ has done. (3.) He argues against salvation by
   our works, upon this very ground, that our good works are the fruit
   following our being saved, and the end for which we are saved. Thus he
   at once overthrows the doctrine of salvation by our good works, and
   establishes the necessity of them, as of breathings and other actions
   of life to a man saved from death. (4.) He shows, that inherent
   holiness is an essential part of salvation, without which it can no
   more consist, than a man without a reasonable soul; for, according to
   the apostle, "We are saved by our being regenerated, renewed, created
   in Christ Jesus, unto good works." And so is our justification also,
   with all the privileges depending thereupon. In one word, the salvation
   bestowed on believers, comprehends both holiness and happiness. Thus
   the apostle Peter disproves that principle, (Acts 15:1), "Except ye be
   circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be SAVED," from his
   own observation of the contrary, namely, that God purified the hearts
   of the Gentiles by faith, (verse 9), adding for the part of the Jews,
   who were circumcised, (verse 11), "We believe, that through the grace
   of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they"; that is,
   even as they were saved, namely, by faith without the works of the law.
   And the apostle Paul, encountering the same error, carries on the
   dispute in these terms, that a man is not justified by works, (Gal 2
   and 3). From whence one may conclude, that justification does no
   further differ from salvation, in the Scripture sense, than an
   essential part from the whole. This is the doctrine of holy Luther, and
   of our author after him, upon this head, here and elsewhere. And the
   disuse of this manner of speaking, and the setting of salvation so far
   from justification, as heaven is from earth, are not without danger, as
   leaving room for works, to obtain salvation by. "They that believe,
   have already everlasting life, and therefore undoubtedly are justified
   and holy, without all their own labour." Luther's Chos. Sermons, Serm.
   10, page [mihi] 113. "How has God, then, remedied thy misery? He has
   forgiven all my sins, and freed me from the reward thereof, and made me
   righteous, holy, and happy, to live for ever, and that of his free
   grace alone, by the merits of Jesus Christ, and working of the Holy
   Ghost." Mr. James Melvil's Cat. Propine of a Pastor, p. 44.--"Now,
   being made truly and really partakers of Christ, and his righteousness,
   by faith only, and so justified, saved, and counted truly righteous, we
   are to see what God craveth of us in our own part, to witness our
   thankfulness." Mr. John Davidson's Cat. p. 27. See Palat. Cat. q.
   86.--"God delivereth his elect out of it [viz: the estate of sin and
   misery] and bringeth them into an estate of salvation by the second
   covenant." Larg. Cat. q. 30. And surely one cannot be in a state of
   salvation who is not really saved; more than one can be in a state of
   health and liberty, who is not really saved from sickness and slavery.
   "Those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only he is
   pleased, in his appointed and accepted time, effectually to call, by
   his word and Spirit, out of that state of sin and death in which they
   are by nature, to grace and salvation--effectually drawing them to
   Jesus Christ." Westm. Confess. chap. 10, art. 1. Whence one may easily
   perceive, that a sinner drawn to Jesus Christ, is saved; though not yet
   carried to heaven.

   [244] A good reason why a soul united to Jesus Christ, and already
   saved by him really, though not perfectly, hath no need of the presence
   of her first husband, the law, or covenant of works: namely, because
   she hath in Christ, her head and present husband, all things necessary
   to save her perfectly, that is, to make her completely holy and happy.
   If it were not so, believers might yet despair of attaining to it:
   since Christ shareth his office of Saviour with none; neither is their
   salvation in any other, whether in whole or in part, (Acts 4:12). But
   surely believers have all that is necessary to complete their
   salvation, in Jesus Christ: forasmuch as he "of God is made unto us
   wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption"; in the
   compass of which, there is sufficient provision for all the wants of
   all his people. It is the great ground of their comfort, that "it
   pleased the Father, that in him should all fullness dwell," (Col 1:19).
   And it becomes them, with their whole hearts, to approve of the design
   and end of that glorious and happy constitution, namely, that "he that
   glorieth, glory in the Lord," (1 Cor 1:31). It is true, that fullness
   is so far from being actually conveyed, in the measure of every part,
   into the persons of believers at once, that the stream of conveyance
   will run through all the ages of eternity, in heaven, as well as on
   earth. Nevertheless, whole Christ, with all his fullness, is given to
   them at once, and therefore they have all necessary for them at once,
   in him as their Head. (1 Cor 3:21), "All things are yours."--(Phil
   4:28), "I have all, and abound."--(2 Cor 6:10), "As having nothing, yet
   possessing all things."--(Col 2:10), "and ye are complete in him, which
   is the Head."

   [245] But are not personal holiness, and godliness, good works, and
   perseverance in holy obedience, jostled out at this rate as
   unnecessary? No, by no means. For Christ is the only fountain of
   holiness, and the cause of good works, in those who are united to him;
   so that, where union with Christ is, there is personal holiness
   infallibly; there they do good works, if capable of them, and persevere
   therein; and where it is not, all pretences to these things are utterly
   vain. Therefore are ministers directed to prosecute such doctrines, and
   make choice of such uses, especially, "as may most draw souls to
   Christ, the fountain of light, holiness, and comfort." Directory, tit.
   "Of the Preaching of the Word."--"As we willingly spoil ourselves of
   all honour and glory of our own creation and redemption, so do we also
   of our regeneration and sanctification; for of ourselves we are not
   sufficient to think one good thought; but he who has begun the work in
   us, is only he that continues us in the same, to the praise and the
   glory of his undeserved grace. So that the cause of good works, we
   confess to be, not our free will, but the Spirit of the Lord Jesus,
   who, dwelling in our hearts by true faith, bringeth forth such works,
   as God has prepared for us to walk in. For this we most boldly affirm,
   that blasphemy it is to say, that Christ abideth in the hearts of such,
   as in whom there is no spirit of sanctification." Old Confess. art. 12,
   13.--"M. What is the effect of thy faith? C. That Jesus Christ his Son
   came down into this world, and accomplished all things, which were
   necessary for our salvation." The Manner to Examine Children, &c.,
   quest. 3.--"Whether we look to our justification or sanctification,
   they are wholly wrought and perfected by Christ, in whom we are
   complete, howbeit after a diverse sort." Mr. John Davidson's Cat. p.
   34. The truth is, personal holiness, godliness, and perseverance, are
   parts of the salvation already bestowed on the believer, and good works
   begun, the necessary fruit thereof. See the preceding note. And he
   hath, in Christ his head, what infallibly secures the conservation of
   his personal holiness and godliness: his bringing forth of good works
   still, and perseverance in holy obedience, and the bringing of the
   whole to perfection in another life, and so completing the begun
   salvation. If men will, without warrant from the word, restrain the
   term salvation to happiness in heaven, then all these, according to the
   doctrine here taught, are necessary to salvation, as what of necessity
   must go before it, in subjects capable; since, in a salvation carried
   on by degrees, what is by the unalterable order of the covenant first
   conferred on a man, must necessarily go before that which, by the same
   unalterable order, is conferred on him in the last place. But in the
   sense of Luther and our author, all these are comprehended in the
   salvation itself. For justifying of which, one may observe, that when
   the salvation is completed, they are perfected; and the saints in glory
   work perfectly good works, without interruption, throughout all
   eternity; for they were the great end God designed to bring about by
   the means of salvation. To the Scripture texts adduced in the preceding
   note, add (2 Tim 2:10), "I endure all things, for the elect's sake,
   that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with
   eternal glory." Here is a spiritual salvation, plainly distinguished
   from eternal glory. Compare (1 Peter 1:8,9), "Believing, ye rejoice.
   Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls."
   This receiving of salvation, in the present time, is but the
   accomplishment of that promise, in part; (Acts 16:31), "Believe on the
   Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved"; which, I make no question,
   bears a great deal of salvation, communicated on this side death, as
   well as beyond it; (Matt 1:21), "He shall save his people from their
   sins." Thus, salvation comprehends personal holiness and godliness. And
   the Scripture holds out good works, as things that accompany salvation,
   (Heb 6:9), and as the fruit of it, (Luke 1:71-75), "That we should be
   saved from our enemies--being delivered out of the hands of our
   enemies, we might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness
   before him, all the days of our life." For it is an everlasting
   salvation, (Isa 45:17), importing a perseverance in holy obedience to
   the end.

   [246] My righteousness, upon which I am justified, my treasure, out of
   which all my debt to the law, or covenant of works, is paid, and my
   work, whence my righteousness arises, and which I can, with safety and
   comfort, oppose to the law-demand of work. "The law of God we confess
   and acknowledge most just, most equal, most holy, most perfect,
   commanding these things, which being wrought in perfection, were able
   to give life, and able to bring man to eternal felicity. But our nature
   is so corrupt, so weak, and so imperfect, that we are never able to
   fulfil the works of the law in perfection--and therefore it behoves us
   to apprehend Christ Jesus, with his justice, i.e., his righteousness
   and satisfaction, who is the end and accomplishment of the law." Old
   Confess. art. 15.

   [247] Namely, in the eye of the law, which acknolwedgeth no godliness
   nor righteousness, but what is every way perfect; (Rom 4:5), "Believeth
   on him that justifieth the UNGODLY." And to plead any other sort of
   godliness or righteousness, in the conflict of conscience with the law,
   is vain. (Gal 3:10)

   [248] That is, Christ hath perfect purity of nature and life, which is
   all that the law can demand in point of conformity and obedience to its
   commandments; he was born holy, and he lived holy in perfection. Now,
   both these are imputed to believers, not in point of sanctification,
   but of justification; for without the imputation of them both, no flesh
   could be justified before God, because the law demands of every man
   purity of nature, as well as purity of life, and both of them in
   perfection; and since we have neither the one nor the other in
   ourselves, we must have both by imputation, else we must remain under
   the condemnation of the law. So, the Palatine Catechism. "Q. How art
   thou righteous before God? A. The perfect satisfaction, righteousness,
   and holiness of Christ is imputed and given unto me, as if I had
   neither committed any sin, neither were there any blot or corruption
   cleaving unto me. Q. 60. The use--If Satan yet lay to my charge,
   Although in Christ Jesus thou hast satisfied the punishment which thy
   sins deserved, and hast put on his righteousness by faith, yet thou
   canst not deny, but that thy nature is corrupt, so that thou art prone
   to all ill, and thou hast in thee, the seed of all vices. Against this
   temptation this answer is sufficient, That by the goodness of God, not
   only perfect righteousness, but even the holiness of Christ also, is
   imputed and given unto me," &c. Ibid.--"the satisfaction,
   righteousness, and holiness of Christ alone is my righteousness, in the
   sight of God." Ibid. quest. 61.

   [249] Namely, to the law or covenant of works, which has no power over
   me, who am now married to another.

   [250] Luther expresses it thus, "What I am, or what I ought to do, and
   what not to do; but what Christ himself is, ought to do, and doth."

   [251] Moses with his tables, here, is no more, in the sense of Luther
   and our author, but the law, as it is the covenant of works; the which,
   whoso in the conflict of conscience with it, can treat at this rate, he
   is strong in faith, and happy is he. Consider the Scripture phrase,
   (John 5:45), "There is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye
   TRUST." Compare (Rom 2:17), "Behold, thou art called a Jew, and RESTEST
   in the LAW." By Moses here, is not meant the person of Moses, but
   Moses' law, which the carnal Jews trusted to be saved and justified by;
   that is plainly, by the law, as it is the covenant of works. And in our
   author's judgment, the law was given on Mount Sinai as the covenant of
   works. And he shows, that although Luther, and Calvin too, do thus
   exempt a believer from the law, in the case of justification, and as it
   is the covenant of works, yet do they not so out of the case of
   justification, and as it is the law of Christ. P. 184-186. And so, at
   once, clears them and himself from that odious charge which some might
   find in their hearts to fix upon them from such expressions.

   [252] Luther's words are, "Then it is time to send it [the law] away,
   and if it will not give place," &c. See the preceding note.

   [253] Here is the use to be made of the same former doctrine, in the
   conflict of conscience with sin. Guilt, even the guilt of revenging
   wrath is the handle by which, in this conflict, sin offers to take hold
   of the believer, as it did of David, (Psa 40:12). Who, in that Psalm,
   speaks as a type of Christ, on whom the guilt of the elect's sin was
   laid. "Now, in respect of that guilt, the strength of sin is the law,
   or covenant of works, with its cursing and condemning power, from
   which, since believers are delivered, that strength of sin is gone as
   to them; they are free from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath of
   God." Westm. Confess. chap. 20. art. 1.--"The revenging wrath of God,
   and that perfectly in this life." Larg. Cat. quest. 77. Whence it
   necessarily follows, that sin, in this attack, can never prevail nor
   really hurt them in this point, since there neither is, nor can be, any
   such guilt remaining upon them. How sin may otherwise prevail against a
   believer, and what hurt it may do him in other respects, the author
   expressly teaches here and elsewhere. In the manner of expression, he
   follows famous divines, whose names are in honour in the church of
   Christ. "God saith unto me, I will forgive thee thy sin, neither shall
   thy sins hurt thee." Luther, Chos. Serm. p. 40.--"Forasmuch as Jesus
   Christ hath, by one infinite obedience, made satisfaction to the
   infinite majesty of God, it followeth, that my iniquities can no more
   fray nor trouble me, my accounts being assuredly razed by the precious
   blood of Christ." Beza, Confess. point 4. art. 10.--"Even as the viper
   that was upon Paul's hand, though the nature of it was to kill
   presently, yet when God had charmed it, you see it hurt him not; so it
   is with sin, though it be in us, and though it hang upon us, yet the
   venom of it is taken away, it hurts us not, it condemns us not." Dr.
   Preston on Faith, p. 51. Hear the language of the Spirit of God, (Luke
   10:19); "And nothing shall by any means hurt you."--"Nothing shall hurt
   their souls, as to the favour of God, and their eternal happiness,"
   says the author of the Supplement to Poole's Annot. on the Text.

   [254] The ten commandments.

   [255] By your own conscience.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER III - OF THE LAW OF CHRIST.

Section 1 - The nature of the law of Christ.

   Nom. Then sir, I pray you, proceed to speak of the law of Christ; and
   first, let us hear what the law of Christ is.

   Evan. The law of Christ, in regard of substance and matter, is all one
   with the law of works, or covenant of works. Which matter is scattered
   through the whole Bible, and summed up in the decalogue, or ten
   commandments, commonly called the moral law, containing such things as
   are agreeably to the mind and will of God, that is, piety towards God,
   charity towards our neighbour, and sobriety towards ourselves. And
   therefore was it given of God to be a true and eternal rule of
   righteousness, for all men, of all nations, and at all times. So that
   evangelical grace directs a man to no other obedience than that whereof
   the law of the ten commandments is to be the rule. [256]

   Nom. But yet, sir, I conceive, that though [as you say] the law of
   Christ, in regard of substance and matter, be all one with the law of
   works, yet their forms do differ.

   Evan. True, indeed; for [as you have heard] the law of works speaks on
   this wise, "Do this and thou shalt live; and if thou do it not, then
   thou shalt die the death": but the law of Christ speaketh on this wise,
   (Eze 16:6), "And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine
   own blood, I said unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, live."--(John
   11:26), "And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."
   [257] --(Eph 5:1,2), "Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear
   children: and walk in love, as Christ hath loved us." And "if ye love
   me, keep my commandments," (John 14:15). And "if they break my
   statutes, and keep not my commandments, then will I visit their
   transgressions with a rod, and their iniquity with stripes;
   nevertheless my loving- kindness will I not utterly take away from him,
   nor suffer my faithfulness to fail," (Psa 89:31-33). Thus, you see,
   that both these laws agree in saying, "Do this." But here is the
   difference; the one saith, "Do this and live"; and the other saith,
   "Live, and do this"; the one saith, Do this for life; the other saith,
   Do this from life: the one saith, "If thou do it not, I will chastise
   thee with the rod." [258] The one is to be delivered by God as he is
   Creator out of Christ, only to such as are out of Christ; the other is
   to be delivered by God, as he is a Redeemer in Christ, only to such as
   are in Christ. [259] Wherefore, neighbour Neophytus, seeing that you
   are now in Christ, beware that you receive not the ten commandments at
   the hands of God out of Christ, nor yet at the hands of Moses, but only
   at the hands of Christ; and so shall you be sure to receive them as the
   law of Christ. [260]

   Nom. But, sir, may not God out of Christ deliver the ten commandments,
   as the law of Christ?

   Evan. O no! for God out of Christ stands in relation to man, according
   to the tenor of the law as it is the covenant of works; and, therefore,
   can speak to man upon no other terms than the terms of that covenant.
   [261]

Chapter III, Section 2

   The law of the ten s a rule of life to believers.

   Nom. But, sir, why may not believers amongst the Gentiles receive the
   ten commandments as a rule of life, at the hands of Moses, as well as
   the believers amongst the Jews did?

   Evan. For answer hereunto, I pray you consider that, the ten
   commandments being the substance of the law of nature [262] engraven in
   the heart of man in innocency, and the express idea, or representation
   of God's own image, even a beam of his own holiness, were to have been
   a rule of life both to Adam and his posterity, though they never had
   been the covenant of works; [263] but being become the covenant of
   words, they were to have been a rule of life to them, as a covenant of
   works. [264] And then, being as it were raised out of man's heart by
   his fall, they were made known to Adam, and the rest of the believing
   fathers, by visions and revelations, and so were a rule of life to him;
   [265] yet not as the covenant of works, as they were before his fall,
   and so continued until the time of Moses. And as they were delivered by
   Moses unto the believing Jews from the ark, and so as from Christ, they
   were a rule of life to them, until the time of Christ's coming in the
   flesh. And since Christ's coming in the flesh, they have been and are
   to be, a rule of life both to believing Jews and believing Gentiles,
   unto the end of the world; not as they are delivered by Moses, but as
   they are delivered by Christ: for when Christ the Son comes and speaks
   himself, then Moses the servant must keep silence; according as Moses
   himself foretold, (Acts 3:22), saying, "A prophet shall the Lord your
   God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear
   in all things which he shall say unto you." And, therefore, when the
   disciples seemed to desire to hear Moses and Elias [266] speak on the
   mountain Tabor, they were presently taken away; and a voice came out of
   the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased;
   hear ye him," (Matt 17:4,5). As if the Lord had said, You are not now
   to hear either Moses or Elias, but my "well-beloved Son"; and,
   therefore, I say unto you, HEAR HIM. [267] And is it not said, (Heb
   1:2), "That in these last days God hath spoken to us by his Son"? and
   doth not the apostle say, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly;
   and whatsoever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of our Lord
   Jesus Christ." The wife must be subject unto the husband, as unto
   Christ; [268] the child must yield obedience to his parents, as unto
   Christ; and the believing servant must do his master's business, as
   Christ's business; for says the apostle, "Ye serve the Lord Christ,"
   (Col 3:16-24). Yea, says he to the Galatians, "Bear ye one another's
   burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ," (Gal 6:2).

   Ant. Sir, I like it very well, that you say, Christ should be a
   Christian's teacher, and not Moses; but yet I question whether the ten
   commandments may be called the law of Christ; for where can you find
   them repeated, either by our Saviour, or his apostles, in the whole New
   Testament?

   Evan. Though we find not that they are repeated in such a method as
   they are set down in Exodus and Deuteronomy, yet so long as we find
   that Christ and his apostles did require and command these things, that
   are therein commanded, and reproved and condemn those things that are
   therein forbidden, and that both by their lives and doctrines, it is
   sufficient to prove them to be the law of Christ. [269]

   Ant. I think, indeed, they have done so, touching some of the
   commandments, but not touching all.

   Evan. Because you say so, I entreat you to consider,--

   1st, Whether the true knowledge of God required, (John 3:19); and the
   want of it condemned, (2 Thess 1:8); and the true love of God required,
   (Matt 22:37); and the want of it reproved, (John 5:42); and the true
   fear of God required, (1 Peter 2:17, Heb 12:28); and the want of it
   condemned, (Rom 3:18); and the true trusting in God required, and the
   trusting in the creature forbidden, (2 Cor 1:9, 1 Tim 6:17); be not the
   substance of the first commandment.

   And consider, 2dly, Whether the "hearing and reading of God's word,"
   commanded, (John 5:39, Rev 1:3); and "prayer," required, (Rom 12:12, 1
   Thess 5:17); and "singing of psalms," required, (Col 3:16, James 5:13);
   and whether "idolatry," forbidden, (1 Cor 10:14, 1 John 5:21); be not
   the substance of the second commandment.

   And consider, 3dly, Whether "worshipping of God in vain," condemned,
   (Matt 15:9); and "using vain repetitions in prayer," forbidden, (Matt
   6:7); and "hearing of the word only, and not doing," forbidden, (James
   1:22); whether "worhsipping God in spirit and truth," commanded, (John
   4:24); and "praying with the spirit and with understanding also"; and
   "singing with the spirit" and "with understanding also," commended, (1
   Cor 14:15); and "taking heed what we hear," (Mark 4:24); be not the
   substance of the third commandment.

   Consider, 4thly, Whether Christ's rising from the dead the first day of
   the week, (Mark 16:2,9); the disciples assembling, and Christ's
   appearing unto them, two several first days of the week, (John
   20:19,26); and the disciples coming together and breaking bread, and
   preaching afterwards on that day, (Acts 20:7, 1 Cor 16:2); and John's
   being in the Spirit on the Lord's day, (Rev 1:10); I say, consider
   whether these things do not prove, that the first day of the week is to
   be kept as the Christian Sabbath.

   Consider, 5thly, Whether the apostle's saying, "Children, obey your
   parents in the Lord, for this is right: honour thy father and thy
   mother, which is the first commandment with promise," (Eph 6:1,2), and
   all these other exhortations, given by him and the apostle Peter, both
   to inferiours and superiours, to do their duty to each other, (Eph
   5:22,25, 6:4,5,9, Col 3:18-22, Titus 3:1, 1 Peter 3:1, 2:18); I say,
   consider whether all these places do not prove that the duties of the
   fifth commandment are required in the New Testament.

   Here you see are five of the ten commandments; and as for the other
   five, the apostle reckons them up altogether, saying, "Thou shalt not
   commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt
   not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet," (Rom 13:9). Now, judge
   you whether the ten commandments be not repeated in the New Testament;
   and so consequently whether they be not the law of Christ, and whether
   a believer be not under the law to Christ, or "in the law through
   Christ," as the apostle's phrase is, (1 Cor 9:21).

Chapter III, Section 3

   Antinomian objections answered. Ant. But yet, sir, as I remember, both
   Luther and Calvin do speak as though a believer were so quite freed
   from the law by Christ, as that he need not make any conscience at all
   of yielding obedience to it.

   Evan. I know right well that Luther on the Galatians, p. 59, says, "The
   conscience hath nothing to do with the law or works"; and that Calvin,
   in his Instit. p. 403, says, "The conscience of the faithful, when the
   affiance of their justification before God is to be sought, must raise
   and advance themselves above the law, and forget the whole
   righteousness of the law, and lay aside all thinking upon works." Now,
   for the true understanding of these two worthy servants of Christ, two
   things are to be considered and concluded. First, That when they speak
   thus of the law, it is evident they mean only in the case of
   justification. Secondly, That when the conscience hath to do with the
   law in the case of justification, it hath to do with it only as it is
   the covenant of works; for as the law is the law of Christ, it neither
   justifies nor condemns. [270] And so, if you understand it of the law,
   as it is the covenant of works, according to their meaning, then it is
   most true what they say; for why should a man let the law come into his
   conscience? That is, why should a man make any conscience of doing the
   law, to be justified thereby, considering it as a thing impossible?
   Nay, what need hath a man to make conscience of doing the law to be
   justified thereby, when he knows he is already justified another way?
   Nay, what need hath a man to make conscience of doing that law, which
   is dead to him, and he to it? Hath a woman any need to make conscience
   of doing her duty to her husband when he is dead, nay, when she herself
   is dead also? or, hath a debtor any need to make any conscience of
   paying that debt which is already fully discharged by his surety? Will
   any man be afraid of that obligation which is made void, the seal torn
   off, the writing defaced, nay, not only cancelled and crossed, but torn
   in pieces? [271] I remember the apostle says, (Heb 10:1,2), That if the
   sacrifices which were offered in the Old Testament "could have made the
   comers thereunto perfect, and have purged the worshippers, then should
   they have had no more conscience of sin"; that is, their conscience
   would not have accused them of being guilty of sins. Now, the "blood of
   Christ" hath "purged the conscience" of a believer from all his sins,
   (9:14), as they are transgressions against the covenant of works; and,
   therefore, what needs his conscience be troubled about that covenant?
   But now, I pray you, observe and take notice, that although Luther and
   Calvin do thus exempt a believer from the law, in the case of
   justification, and as it is the law or covenant of works, yet they do
   not so, out of the case of justification, and as it is the law of
   Christ.

   For thus saith Luther, on the Galatians, p. 182, "Out of the matter of
   justification, we ought, with Paul, (Rom 7:12,14), to think reverently
   of the law, to commend it highly to call it holy, righteous, just,
   good, spiritual, and divine. Yea, out of the case of justification, we
   ought to make a God of it." [272] And in another place, says he, on the
   Galatians, p. 5, "There is a civil righteousness, and a ceremonial
   righteousness; yea, and besides these, there is another righteousness,
   which is the righteousness of the law, or of the ten commandments,
   which Moses teacheth; this also we teach after the doctrine of faith."
   And in another place, he having showed that believers, through Christ,
   are far above the law, adds, "Howbeit, I will not deny but Moses
   showeth to them their duties, in which respect they are to be
   admonished and urged; wherefore such doctrines and admonitions ought to
   be among Christians, as it is certain there was among the apostles,
   whereby every man may be admonished of his estate and office."

   And Calvin, having said, as I told you before, "That Christians, in the
   case of justification, must raise and advance themselves above the
   law," adds, "Neither can any man thereby gather that the law is
   superfluous to the faithful, whom, notwithstanding, it doth not cease
   to teach, exhort, and prick forward to goodness, although before God's
   judgment-seat it hath no place in their conscience."

   Ant. But, sir, if I forget not, Musculus says, "That the law is utterly
   abrogated."

   Evan. Indeed, Musculus, speaking of the ten commandments, says, If they
   be weak, if they be the letter, if they do work transgression, anger,
   curse, and death: and if Christ, by the law of the Spirit of life,
   delivered them that believed in him from the law of the letter, which
   was weak to justify, and strong to condemn, and from the curse, being
   made a curse for us, surely, they be abrogated. Now, this is most
   certain, that the ten commandments do no way work transgression, anger,
   curse, and death, but only as they are the covenant of works. [273]
   Neither hath Christ delivered believers any otherwise from them, than
   as they are the covenant of works. And therefore we may assuredly
   conclude, that they are no otherwise abrogated, than as they are the
   covenant of works. [274] Neither did Musculus intend any otherwise;
   for, says he, in the words following, it must not be understood, that
   the points of the substance of Moses' covenant are utterly brought to
   nothing; [275] God forbid. For a Christian man is not at liberty to do
   those things that are ungodly and wicked; and if the doing of those
   things the law forbids, do not displease Christ; if they be no much
   different, [276] yea contrary; if they be not repugnant to the
   righteousness which we received of him; let it be lawful for a
   Christian man to do them; or else not. [277] But a Christian man doing
   against those things which are commanded in the decalogue, doth sin
   more outrageously than he that should so do, being under the law; [278]
   so far off is he from being free from those things that be there
   commanded.

   Chapter III, Secion 4

   The necessity of marks and signs of grace.

   Wherefore, friend Antinomista, if either you, or any man else, shall,
   under a pretence of your being in Christ, exempt yourselves from being
   under the law of the ten commands, as they are the law of Christ, I
   tell you truly, it is a shrewd sign you are not yet in Christ; for if
   you were, then Christ were in you; and If Christ were in you, then
   would he govern you, and you would be subject unto him. I am sure the
   prophet Isaiah tell us, that the same Lord, who is our Saviour, "is
   also our King and Lawgiver," (Isa 33:22); and, truly, he will not be
   Jesus a Saviour to any but only to those unto whom he is Christ a Lord;
   for the very truth is, wheresoever he is Jesus a Saviour, he is also
   Christ a Lord; and, therefore, I beseech you, examine yourself whether
   he be so to you or no.

   Ant. Why then, sir, it seems that you stand upon marks and signs?

   Evan. Yea, indeed, I stand so much upon marks and signs, that I say
   unto you in the words of the apostle John, (1 John 3:10), "In this the
   children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil; whosoever
   does not righteousness, is not of God." For says Luther, "He that is
   truly baptized, is become a new man, and has a new nature, and is
   endowed with new dispositions; and loveth, liveth, speaketh, and does
   far otherwise than he was wont, or could before." For says godly
   Tindal, "God worketh with his word, and in his word: and bringeth faith
   into the hearts of his elect, and looseth the heart from sin, and
   knitteth it to God, and giveth a man power to do that which was before
   impossible for him to do, and turneth him into a new nature." 1 And,
   therefore, says Luther in another place, "Herein works are to be
   extolled and commended, in that they are fruits and signs of faith;
   and, therefore, he that hath no regard how he leadeth his life, that he
   may stop the mouths of all blamers and accusers, and clear himself
   before all, and testify the he has lived, spoken, and done well, is not
   yet a Christian." How then, says Tindal again, "dare any man think that
   God's favour is on him, and God's Spirit within him, when he feels not
   the working of his Spirit, nor himself disposed to any good thing?" 2
   Evan. Indeed, I must needs confess with Mr. Bolton and Mr. Dyke, that
   in these times of Christianity, a reprobate may make a glorious
   profession of the gospel, and perform all the duties and exercises of
   religion, and that, in outward appearance, with as great spirit and
   zeal as a true believer; yea, he may be made partaker of some measure
   of inward illumination, and have a shadow of true regeneration; there
   being no grace effectually wrought in the faithful, a resemblance
   whereof may not be found in the unregenerate. And therefore, I say, if
   any man pitch upon the sign, without the thing signified by the sign, 3
   that is, if he pitch upon his graces [or gifts rather] and duties, and
   conclude The Marrow of Modern Divinity by THOMAS BOSTON

Chapter III, Section 5

   Antinomian objections answered.

   Ant. But, sir, you know the Lord hath promised to write his law in a
   believer's heart, and to give him his Spirit to lead him into all
   truth: and therefore he hath no need of the law, written with paper and
   ink, to be a rule of life to him; neither hath he any need to endeavour
   to be obedient thereunto, as you say.

   Evan. Indeed, says Luther, the matter would even so far as you say, if
   we were perfectly and altogether the inward and spiritual men, which
   cannot be in any wise before the last day at the rising again of the
   dead: [279] so long as we be clothed with this mortal flesh, we do but
   begin and proceed onwards in our course towards perfection, which will
   be consummated in the life to come: and for this cause the apostle,
   (Rom 8) doth call this the "first fruits of the Spirit," which we do
   enjoy in this life, the truth and fullness of which we shall receive in
   the life to come. And therefore, says he in another place, it is
   necessary so to preach to them that have received the doctrine of
   faith, that they might be stirred up to go on in good life, which they
   have embraced; and that they suffer not themselves to be overcome by
   the assaults of the raging flesh; for we will not so presume of the
   doctrine of faith, as if, that being had, every man might do what he
   listed: no, we must earnestly endeavour ourselves, that we may be
   without blame; and when we cannot attain thereunto, we must flee to
   prayer, and say before God and man, "Forgive us our trespasses." And,
   says Calvin, Instit. p. 162, one proper use and end of the law,
   concerning the faithful, [280] in whose hearts liveth and reigneth the
   Spirit of God, is this: namely, although they have the law written and
   engraven in their hearts by the finger of God, yet is the [281] law to
   them a very good means, whereby they may daily, better and more
   assuredly, learn what is the will of the Lord: and let none of us
   exempt himself from this need, for no man hath hitherto attained to so
   great wisdom, but that he hath need to be daily instructed by the law.
   And herein Christ differeth from us, that the Father hath poured out
   upon him the infinite abundance of his Spirit: but whatsoever we do
   receive, it is so by measure, that we have need one of another.

   Now mind it, I pray you, if believers have the Spirit but in measure,
   and know but in part, then have they the "law written in their hearts"
   but in measure and in part, [282] (1 Cor 13:9); and if they have the
   law written in their hearts but in measure and in part, then have they
   not a perfect rule within them; and if they have not a perfect rule
   within them, then they have need to have a rule without them. And
   therefore, doubtless, the strongest believer of us all, had need to
   hearken to the advice of Tindal, who says, "Seek the word of God in all
   things, and without the word of God do nothing." And says another godly
   and evangelical writer, "My brethren, let us do our whole endeavour to
   do the will of God as it becometh good children, and beware that we sin
   not, as near as we can."

   Ant. Well, sir, I cannot tell what to say, but, methinks, when a man is
   perfectly justified by faith, it is a very needless thing for him to
   endeavour to keep the law, and to do good works. [283]

   Evan. I remember Luther says, that in his time there were some that did
   reason after the like manner: "If faith, say they, do accomplish all
   things, and if faith be only and alone sufficient unto righteousness,
   to what end are we commanded to do good deeds? we may go play then, and
   work no working at all." To whom he makes an answer, saying, "Not so,
   ye ungodly! not so." And there were others that said, "If the law do
   not justify, then it is in vain, and of none effect." "Yet it is not
   therefore true, says he; for like as this consequence is nothing worth,
   money doth not justify or make a man righteous, therefore it is
   unprofitable; the eyes do not justify, therefore they must be plucked
   out; the hands make not a man righteous, therefore they must be cut
   off; so is this naught also, the law doth not justify, therefore it is
   unprofitable. We do not therefore destroy and condemn the law, because
   we say it doth not justify; but we say with Paul, (1 Tim 1:8), 'the law
   is good, if a man do rightly use it.' And that this is a faithful
   saying, that they 'which have believed in God might be careful to
   maintain good works; these things are good and profitable unto men,'"
   (Titus 3:8).

Chapter III, Section 6

   Holiness and good works attained to only by faith.

   Neo. Truly, sir, for mine own part, I do much marvel that this my
   friend Antinomista should be so confident of his faith in Christ, and
   yet so little regard holiness of life, and keeping of Christ's
   commandments, as it seems he does. For I give the Lord thanks, I do
   now, in some small measure, believe that I am, by Christ, freely and
   fully justified and acquitted from all my sins, and therefore have no
   need either to eschew evil or do good, for fear of punishment or hope
   of reward; and yet, methinks, I find my heart more willing and desirous
   to do what the Lord commands, and to avoid what he forbids, than ever
   it was before I did thus believe. [284] Surely, sir, I do perceive that
   faith in Christ is no hindrance to holiness of life, as I once thought
   it was.

   Evan. Neighbour Neophytus, if our friend Antinomista do content himself
   with a mere gospel knowledge, in a notionary way, and have run out to
   fetch in notions from Christ, and yet is not fetched in by the power of
   Christ, let us pity him, and pray for him. And in the mean time, I pray
   you, know that true faith in Christ [285] is so far from being a
   hindrance from holiness of life and good works, that it is the only
   furtherance; for only by faith in Christ, a man is enabled to exercise
   all Christian graces aright, and to perform all Christian duties
   aright, which before he could not. As, for example, before a man
   believe God's love to him in Christ, though he may have a kind of love
   to God, as he is his Creator and Preserver, and gives him many good
   things for this present life, yet if God do but open his eyes, to see
   what condition his soul is in, that is, if he do but let him see that
   relation that is betwixt God and him, according to the tenor of the
   covenant of works, then he conceives of him as an angry Judge, armed
   with justice against him, and must be pacified by the works of the law,
   whereunto he finds his nature opposite and contrary; and therefore he
   hates both God and his law, and doth secretly wish and desire there
   were neither God nor law. And though God should now give unto him ever
   so many temporal blessings, yet could he not love him; for what
   malefactor could love that judge or his law, from whom he expected the
   sentence of condemnation, though he should feast him at his table with
   ever so many dainties? "But after that the kindness and love of God his
   Saviour hath appeared, not by works of righteousness that he hath done,
   but according to his mercy he saved him," (Titus 3:4,5); that is, when
   as by the eye of faith, he sees himself to stand in relation to God,
   according to the tenor of the covenant of grace, [286] then he
   conceives of God as a most merciful and loving Father to him in Christ,
   that hath freely pardoned and forgiven him all his sins, and quite
   released him from the covenant of works; [287] and by this means "the
   love of God is shed abroad in his heart, through the Holy Ghost which
   is given to him," and then "he loves God because he first loved him,"
   (Rom 5:5, 1 John 4:19). For as a man seeth and feeleth by faith the
   love and favour of God towards him in Christ his Son, so doth he love
   again both God and his law; and indeed it is impossible for any man to
   love God, till by faith he know himself beloved of God.

   Secondly, Though a man, before he believe God's love to him in Christ,
   may have a great measure of legal humiliation, compunction, sorrow, and
   grief, and be brought down, as it were, to the very gate of hell, and
   feel the very flashing of hell-fire in his conscience for his sins, yet
   it is not because he hath thereby offended God, but rather because he
   hath thereby offended himself, that is, because he hath thereby brought
   himself into the danger of eternal death and condemnation. [288] But
   when once he believes the love of God to him in Christ in pardoning his
   iniquity, and passing by his transgressions, [289] then he sorrows and
   grieves for the offence of God by sin; reasoning thus with himself: And
   is it so indeed? Hath the Lord given his own Son to death for me who
   have been such a vile sinful wretch? And hath Christ borne all thy
   sins? and was he wounded for thy transgressions? Oh then, the working
   of his bowels, the stirring of his affections, the melting and
   relenting of his repenting heart! "Then he remembers his own evil ways,
   and his doings that were not good, and loathes himself in his own eyes
   for all his abominations"; and looking upon Christ, "whom he hath
   pierced, he mourns bitterly for him, as one mourneth for his only son,"
   (Eze 36:31, Zech 12:10). Thus, when faith has bathed a man's heart in
   the blood of Christ, it is so mollified that it quickly dissolves into
   tears of godly sorrow; so that if Christ do but turn and look upon him,
   Oh then, with Peter, he goes out and weeps bitterly! And this is true
   gospel-mourning; and this is right evangelical repenting. [290]

   Thirdly, Though, before a man do truly believe in Christ, he may so
   reform his life and amend his ways, that as "touching the righteousness
   which is of the law," he may be, with the apostle, blameless, (Phil
   3:6); yet, being under the covenant of works, all the obedience that he
   yields to the law, all his leaving off of sin, and performance of
   duties, all his avoiding what the law forbids, and all his doing what
   the law commands, is begotten by the law of works, of Hagar the
   bond-woman, by the force of self-love; and so, indeed, they are the
   fruit and works of a bond-servant, that is moved and constrained to do
   all that he doth, for fear of punishment and hope of reward. [291]
   "For," says Luther, on the Galatians, p. 218, "the law given on Mount
   Sinai, which the Arabians call Agar, begetteth none but servants." And
   so indeed all that such a man doth is but hypocrisy; for he pretends
   the serving of God, whereas, indeed, he intends the serving of himself.
   And how can he do otherwise? for whilst he wants faith, he wants all
   things: he is an empty vine, and therefore must needs bring forth fruit
   unto himself: (Hosea 10:1). Till a man be served himself, he will not
   serve the Lord Christ. [292] Nay, while he wants faith, he wants the
   love of Christ, and therefore he lives not to Christ, but to himself,
   because he loves himself. And hence, surely, we may conceive it is that
   Dr. Preston says, "All that a man doeth, not out of love, is out of
   hypocrisy. Wheresoever love is not, there is nothing but hypocrisy in
   such a man's heart."

   But when a man, through the "hearing of faith, receives the Spirit of
   Christ," (Gal 3:2), that Spirit, according to the measure of faith,
   writes the lively law of love in his heart, [as Tindal sweetly says,]
   whereby he is enabled to work freely and of his own accord, without the
   co-action or compulsion of the law. [293] For that love wherewith
   Christ, or God in Christ, hath loved him, and which by faith is
   apprehended of him, will constrain him to do so; according to that of
   the apostle, (2 Cor 5:14), "The love of Christ constraineth us." That
   is, it will make him do so, whether he will or no; he cannot choose,
   but do it. [294] I tell you truly, answerably as the love of Christ is
   shed abroad in the heart of any man, it is such a strong impulsion,
   that it carries him on to serve and please the Lord in all things,
   according to the saying of an evangelical man: [295] "The will and
   affection of a believer, according to the measure of faith and the
   spirit received, sweetly quickens and bends, to choose, affect, and
   delight in whatever is good and acceptable to God, or a good man; the
   Spirit freely and cheerfully moving and inclining him to keep the law,
   without fear of hell or hope of heaven." For a Christian man, says
   sweet Tindal, worketh only because it is the will of his Father; for
   after that he is overcome with love and kindness, he seeks to do the
   will of God, which is indeed a Christian man's nature; and what he
   doth, he doth it freely after the example of Christ. As a natural son,
   ask him why he does such a thing. Why, says he, it is the will of my
   Father, and I do it that I may please him; for, indeed, love desireth
   no wages, it is wages enough to itself, it hath sweetness enough in
   itself, it desires no addition, it pays its own wages. And therefore it
   is the true child-like obedience, being begotten by faith, of Sarah the
   free-woman, by the force of God's love. And so it is indeed the only
   true and sincere obedience: for, says Dr. Preston, "To do a thing in
   love, is to do it in sincerity; and, indeed, there is no other
   definition of sincerity; that is the best way to know it by."

Chapter III, Section 7

   Slavish fear and servile hope not the springs of true obedience.

   Nom. But stay, sir, I pray you, would you not have believers to eschew
   evil and do good, for fear of hell, or for hope of heaven?

   Evan. No, indeed, I would not have any believer to do either the one or
   the other; for so far forth as they do so, their obedience is but
   slavish. [296] And therefore though, when they were first awakened and
   convinced of their misery, and set foot forward to go on in the way of
   life, they, with the prodigal, would be hired servants; yet when, by
   the eye of faith, they see the mercy and indulgence of their heavenly
   Father in Christ, running to meet them and embrace them; I would have
   them, with him, to talk no more of being hired servants, (Luke 16). I
   would have them so to wrestle against doubting, and so to exercise
   their faith as to believe, that they are by Christ "delivered from the
   hands of their enemies," both the law, sin, wrath, death, the devil,
   and hell, "that they may serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and
   righteousness all the days of their lives," (Luke 1:74,75). I would
   have them so to believe God's love to them in Christ, as that thereby
   they may be constrained to obedience. [297]

   Nom. But, sir, you know that our Saviour says, "Fear him that is able
   to destroy both soul and body in hell," (Matt 10:28). And the apostle
   says, "We shall receive of the Lord the reward of the inheritance,"
   (Col 3:24). And is it not said, that "Moses had respect unto the
   recompense of reward"? (Heb 11:26).

   Evan. Surely the intent of our blessed Saviour, in that first
   Scripture, is to teach all believers, that when God commands one thing,
   and man another, they should obey God, and not man, rather than to
   exhort them to eschew evil for fear of hell. [298] And for those other
   Scriptures by you alleged, if you mean reward, and the means to obtain
   that reward, in the Scripture sense, then it is another matter; but I
   had thought you had meant in our common sense, and not in Scripture
   sense.

   Nom. Why, sir, I pray you, what difference is there betwixt reward, and
   the means to obtain the reward, in our common sense, and in the
   Scripture sense?

   Evan. Why, reward, in our common sense, is that which is conceived to
   come from God, or to be given by God; which is a fancying of heaven
   under carnal notions, beholding it as a place where there is freedom
   from all misery, and fullness of all pleasures and happiness, and to be
   obtained by our own works and doings. [299] But reward in the Scripture
   sense, is not so much that which comes from God, or is given by God, as
   that which lies in God, even the full fruition of God himself in
   Christ. "I am," says God to Abraham, "thy shield, and thy exceeding
   great reward," (Gen 15:1), and "Whom have I in heaven but thee?" says
   David; "and there is none on earth that I desire besides thee," (Psa
   73:25); and "I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness,"
   [300] (Psa 17:15). And the means to obtain this reward is, not by
   doing, but by believing; even by "drawing near with a true heart, in
   the full assurance of faith," (Heb 10:22); and so indeed it is given
   freely. [301] And therefore you are not to conceive of that reward
   which the Scripture speaks of, as if it were the wages of a servant,
   but as it is the inheritance of sons. [302] And when the Scripture
   seemeth to induce believers to obedience, by promising this reward, you
   are to conceive that the Lord speaks to believers as a father does to
   his young son, Do this or that and then I will love thee; whereas we
   know, that the father loveth the son first, and so does God; and
   therefore this is the voice of believers, "We love him, because he
   first loved us," (1 John 4:19). The Lord doth pay them, or at least
   gives them a sure earnest of their wages, before he bid them work;
   [303] and therefore the contest of a believer [according to the measure
   of his faith] is not, what will God give me? but, what shall I give
   God? "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his goodness? For thy
   loving-kindness is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth,"
   (Psa 116:12, 26:3).

   Nom. Then, sir, it seems that holiness of life, and good works, are not
   the cause of eternal happiness, but only the way thither?

   Evan. Do you not remember that our Lord Jesus himself says, "I am the
   way, the truth, and the life"? (John 14:6); and doth not the apostle
   say to the believing Colossians, "As ye have received Jesus Christ the
   Lord, so walk in him"? (Col 2:6); that is, as ye have received him by
   faith, so go on in your faith, and by his power walk in his
   commandments. So that good works, as I conceive, may rather be called a
   believer's walking in the way of eternal happiness, than the way
   itself; but, however, this we may assuredly conclude, that the sum and
   substance both of the way, and walking in the way, consists in the
   receiving of Jesus Christ by faith, and in yielding obedience to his
   law, according to the measure of that receiving. [304]

Chapter III, Section 8

   The efficacy of faith for holiness of heart and life.

   Neo. Sir, I am persuaded, that through my neighbour Nomista's asking
   you these

   questions, you have been interrupted in your discourse, in showing how
   faith

   enables a man to exercise his Christian graces, and perform his
   Christina duties

   aright: and therefore I pray you go on.

   Evan. What should I say more? for the time would fail me to tell, how
   that,

   according to the measure of any man's faith, is his true peace of
   conscience; for,

   says the apostle, "being justified by faith, we have peace with God,"
   (Rom 5:1).

   Yea, says the prophet Isaiah, "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,
   whose mind

   is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee," (Isa 26:3). Here there
   is a sure and

   true grounded peace: "Therefore it is of faith," says the apostle,
   "that it might be

   by grace, and that the promise might be sure to all the seed," (Rom
   4:16). And

   answerable to a man's believing that he is "justified freely by God's
   grace, through

   that redemption that is in Jesus Christ," [305] (Rom 4:3,24), is his
   true humility of

   spirit. So that, although he be endowed with excellent gifts and
   graces, and though

   he perform never so many duties, he denies himself in all; he does not
   make them

   as ladders for him to ascend up into heaven by, but he desires to "be
   found in

   Christ, not having his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that
   which is

   through the faith of Christ," (Phil 3:9). He does not think himself to
   be one step

   nearer to heaven, for all his works and performances. And if he hear
   any man

   praise him for his gifts and graces, he will not conceive that he has
   obtained the

   same by his own industry and pains-taking, as some men have proudly
   thought;

   neither will he speak it out, as some have done, saying; These gifts
   and graces

   have cost me something--I have taken much pains to obtain them; but he
   says,

   "By the grace of God I am what I am; and not I, but the grace of God
   that was

   with me," (1 Cor 15:10). And if he behold an ignorant man, or a wicked
   liver, he

   will not call him "Carnal wretch!" or, "Profane fellow!" nor say,
   "Stand by

   thyself, come not near me, for I am holier than thou," (Isa 65:5), as
   some have

   said; but he pities such a man, and prays for him; and in his heart he
   says

   concerning himself, "Who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that
   thou

   hast not received"? (1 Cor 4:7).

   And thus I might go on, and show you how, according to any man's faith,
   is his

   true joy in God, and his true thankfulness to God, and his patience in
   all troubles

   and afflictions, and his contentedness in any condition, and his
   willingness to

   suffer, and his cheerfulness in suffering, and his contentedness to
   part with any

   earthly thing. Yea, according to any man's faith, is his ability to
   pray aright, (Rom

   10:14), to receive the sacrament with profit and comfort: and to do any
   duty

   either to God or man after a right manner, and to a right end, (Heb
   4:2). Yea,

   according to the measure of any man's faith, in his love to Christ, and
   so to man

   for Christ's sake; and so, consequently, his readiness and willingness
   to forgive an

   injury; yea, to forgive an enemy, and to do good to them that hate him;
   and the

   more faith any man has, the less love he has to the world or the things
   that are in

   the world. To conclude, the greater any man's faith is, the more fit he
   is to die,

   and the more willing he is to die.

   Neo. Well, sir, now I do perceive that faith is a most excellent grace,
   and happy is

   that man who has a great measure of it.

   Evan. The truth is, faith is the chief grace that Christians are to be
   exhorted to get

   and exercise; and therefore, when the people asked our Lord Christ,
   "What they

   should do to work the works of God," he answered and said, "This is the
   work of

   God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent," (John 6:29); speaking
   as if there

   were no other duty at all required, but only believing; for, indeed, to
   say as the

   thing is, believing includes all other duties in it, and they spring
   all from it; and

   therefore says one, "Preach faith, and preach all."--"Whilst I bid man
   believe,"

   says learned Rollock, "I bid him do all good things"; for, says Dr.
   Preston, "Truth

   of belief will bring forth truth of holiness; if a man believe, works
   of sanctification

   will follow; for faith draws after it inherent righteousness and
   sanctification.

   Wherefore" says he, "if a man will go about this great work, to change
   his life, to

   get victory over any sin, that it may not have dominion over him, to
   have his

   conscience purged from dead works and to be made partaker of the divine
   nature,

   let him not go about it as a moral man"; that is, let him not consider
   what

   commandments there are, what the rectitude is which the law requires,
   and how

   to bring his heart to it; but "let him go about it as a Christian, that
   is, let him

   believe the promise of pardon, in the blood of Christ; and the very
   believing the

   promise will be able to cleanse his heart from dead works." [306]

   Neo. But I pray you, sir, whence has faith its power and virtue to do
   all this?

   Evan. Even from our Lord Jesus Christ; for faith doth ingraft a man,
   who is by

   nature a wild olive branch, into Christ as into the natural olive; and
   fetches sap

   from the root, Christ, and thereby makes the tree bring forth fruit in
   its kind; yea,

   faith fetcheth a supernatural efficacy from the death and life of
   Christ; by virtue

   whereof it metamorphoses [307] the heart of a believer, and creates and
   infuses into

   him new principles of action. [308] So that, what a treasure of all
   graces Christ hath

   stored up in him, faith draineth, and draweth them out to the use of a
   believer;

   being as a conduit-cock, that watereth all the herbs of the garden.
   Yea, faith does

   apply the blood of Christ to a believer's heart; and the blood of
   Christ has in it,

   not only a power to wash from the guilt of sin, but to cleanse and
   purge likewise

   from the power and stain of sin, and therefore, says godly Hooker, "If
   you would

   have grace, you must first of all get faith, and that will bring all
   the rest, let faith

   go to Christ, and there is meekness, patience, humility, and wisdom,
   and faith will

   fetch all them to the soul; therefore, [says he,] you must not look for

   sanctification till you come to Christ in vocation."

   Nom. Truly, sir, I do now plainly see that I have been deceived, and
   have gone a

   wrong way to work; for I verily thought that holiness of life must go
   before faith,

   and so be the ground of it, and produce and bring it forth; whereas I
   do now

   plainly see, that faith must go before, and so produce and bring forth
   holiness of

   life.

   Evan. I remember a man, who was much enlightened in the knowledge of
   the

   gospel, [309] who says, "There may be many that think, that as a man
   chooses to

   serve a prince, so men choose to serve God. So likewise they think that
   as those

   who do best service, do obtain most favour of their lord; and as those
   that have

   lost it, the more they humble themselves, the sooner they recover it;
   even so they

   think the case stands between God and them; whereas, says he, it is not
   so, but

   clean contrary, for he himself says, 'Ye have not chosen me, but I have
   chosen

   you,' (John 15:16). And not for that we repent and humble ourselves,
   and do

   good works, he gives us his grace; but we repent and humble ourselves,
   do good

   works, and become holy, because he gives us his grace." The good thief
   on the

   cross was not illuminated, because he did confess Christ; but he did
   confess

   Christ, because he was illuminated. For, says Luther, on Galatians, p.
   124, "The

   tree must first be, and then the fruit; for the apples make not the
   tree, but the tree

   makes the apples. So faith first maketh the person, which afterwards
   brings forth

   works. Therefore to do the law without faith, is to make the apples of
   wood and

   earth without the tree, which is not to make apples, but mere
   fantasies."

   Wherefore, neighbour Nomista, let me entreat you, that whereas before
   you have

   reformed your life that you might believe, why, now believe that you
   may reform

   your life: and do not any longer work to get an interest in Christ, but
   believe your

   interest in Christ, that so you may work. [310] And then you will not
   make the change

   of your life the ground of your faith, as you have done, and as Mr.
   Culverwell

   says, many do, who being asked, What caused them to believe? answer,

   "Because they have truly repented, and changed their course of life."
   [311]

   Ant. Sir, what think you of a preacher that, in my hearing, said, he
   durst not exhort nor persuade sinners to believe their sins were
   pardoned, before he saw their lives reformed, for fear they should take
   more liberty to sin?

   Evan.. Why, what should I say but that I think that preacher was
   ignorant of the mystery of faith? [312] For it, [313] is of the nature
   of sovereign waters, which so wash off the corruption of the ulcer,
   that they cool the heat, and stay the spreading of the infection, and
   so by degrees heal the same. Neither did he know that it is of the
   nature of cordials, which so comfort the heart and ease it, that they
   also expel the noxious humours, and strengthen nature against them.
   [314]

   Ant. And I am acquainted with a professor, though, God knows, [315] a
   very weak one, that says, If he should believe before his life be
   reformed, then he might believe, and yet walk on in his sins:â?"I pray
   you, sir, what would you say to such a man?

   Evan. Why, I could say with Dr. Preston, let him, if he can, believe
   truly, and do this; but it is impossible: let him believe, and the
   other will follow; truth of belief will bring forth truth of holiness:
   for who, if he ponder it well, can fear a fleshly licentiousness, where
   the believing soul is united and married to Christ? [316] The law, as
   it is the covenant of works, and Christ, are set in opposition, as two
   husbands to one wife successively, (Rom 7:4); whilst the law was alive
   in the conscience, all the fruits were deadly, (verse 5); but Christ,
   taking the same spouse to himself, the law being dead, by his
   quickening Spirit doth make her fruitful to God, (verse 6); and so
   raises up seed to the former husband: for materially these are the
   works of the law, though produced by the Spirit of Christ in the
   gospel. [317]

   Ant. And yet, sir, I am verily persuaded, that there be many, both
   preachers and professors, in this city, of the very same opinion, that
   these two are of.

   Evan. The truth is, many preachers stand upon the praise of some moral
   virtue, and do inveigh against some vice of the times, more than upon
   pressing men to believe. But, says a learned writer, "It will be our
   condemnation, if we love darkness, rather than light, and desire still
   to be groping in the twilight of morality, the precepts of moral men,
   than to walk in the true light of divinity, which is the doctrine of
   Jesus Christ; and I pity the preposterous care and unhappy travail of
   many well-affected, who study the practice of this and that virtue,
   neglecting this cardinal and radical virtue; as if a man should water
   all the tree, and not the root. Fain would they shine in patience,
   meekness, and zeal, and yet are not careful to establish and root
   themselves in faith, which should maintain all the rest; and therefore
   all their labour has been in vain and to no purpose."

   Nom. Indeed, sir, this which you have now said, I have found true by my
   own experience; for I have [318] laboured and endeavoured to get
   victory over such corruptions as to overcome my dullness, and to
   perform duties with cheerfulness,

   and all in vain.

   Evan. And no marvel; for to pray, to meditate, to keep a Sabbath
   cheerfully, to

   have your conversation in heaven, is as impossible for you yourself to
   do, as for

   iron to swim, or for stones to ascend upwards; but yet nothing is
   impossible to

   faith; it can naturalize these things unto you; it can make a mole of
   the earth a

   soul of heaven. Wherefore, though you have tried all moral conclusions
   of

   purposing, promising, resolving, vowing, fasting, watching, and self-
   revenge; yet

   get you to Christ, and with the finger of faith touch but the hem of
   his garment;

   and you shall feel virtue come from him, for the curing of all your
   diseases.

   Wherefore I beseech you, come out of yourself unto Jesus Christ, and
   apprehend

   him by faith, as, blessed be God, you see your neighbour Neophytus has
   done;

   and then shall you find the like loathing of sin, and love to the law
   of Christ, as he

   now does; yea, then shall you find your corruptions dying and decaying
   daily,

   more and more, as I am confident he shall.

   Neo. Aye, but, sir, shall I not have power quite to overcome all my
   corruptions,

   and to yield perfect obedience to the law of Christ, as, the Lord
   knows, I much

   desire?

   Evan. If you could believe perfectly, then should it be even according
   to your

   desire; according to that of Luther, on the Galatians, p. 173, "If we
   could

   perfectly apprehend Christ, then should we be free from sin": but alas!
   whilst we

   are here, we know but in part, and so believe but in part, and so
   receive Christ

   but in part, (1 Cor 13:9), and so, consequently, are holy but in part;
   witness

   James the Just, including himself, when he says, "In many things we sin
   all,"

   (James 3:2). John the faithful and loving disciple, when he says, "If
   we say that

   we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us," (1
   John 1:8).

   Yea, and witness Luther, when he says on the Galatians, p. 144, "A
   Christian

   man hath a body, in whose members as Paul says, 'sin dwelleth and
   warreth,'

   (Rom 7:15). And although he fall not into outward and gross sins, as
   murder,

   adultery, theft, and such like, yet is he not free from impatience and
   murmuring

   against God; yea, [says he] I feel in myself covetousness, lust, anger,
   pride, and

   arrogancy, also the fear of death, heaviness, hatred, murmurings
   impatience." So

   that you must not look to be quite without sin, whilst you remain in
   this life; yet

   this I dare promise you, that as you grow from faith to faith, so shall
   you grow

   from strength to strength in all other graces. "Wherefore," says
   Hooker,

   "strengthen this grace of faith, and strengthen all; nourish this, and
   nourish all." So

   that if you can attain to a great measure of faith, you shall be sure
   to attain to a

   great measure of holiness; according to the saying of Dr. Preston, "He
   that hath

   the strongest faith, he that believeth in the greatest degree the
   promise of pardon

   and remission of sins, I dare boldly say, he hath the holiest heart,
   and the holiest

   life. And therefore, I beseech you labour to grow strong in the faith
   of the

   gospel," (Phil 1:27).

Chapter III, Section 9

   Use of means for strengthening of faith.

   Neo. O sir, I desire it with all my heart; and therefore, I pray you,
   tell me, what you would have me to do, that I may grow more strong.

   Evan. Why, surely, the best advice and counsel that I can give you, is
   to exercise that faith which you have, and wrestle against doubting,
   and be earnest with God in prayer for the increase of it. "Forasmuch,"
   says Luther, "as this gift is in the hands of God only, who bestoweth
   when, and on whom, he pleaseth, thou must resort unto him by prayer,
   and say with the apostles, 'Lord, increase our faith,'" (Luke 17:5).
   and you must also be diligent in hearing the word preached; for as
   "faith cometh by hearing," (Rom 10:17), so is it also increased by
   hearing. And you must also read the word, and meditate upon the free
   and gracious promises of God; for the promise is the immortal seed,
   whereby the Spirit of Christ begets and increases faith in the hearts
   of all his. And lastly, you must frequent the sacrament of the Lord's
   supper, and receive it as often as conveniently you can.

   Ant. But by your favour, sir, if faith be the gift of God, and he give
   it when, and to whom he pleases, then I conceive that a man's using
   such means will not procure any greater measure of it than God is
   pleased to give.

   Evan. I confess it is not the means that will either beget or increase
   faith; but it is the Spirit of God in the use of means that doth it: so
   that as the means will not do it without the Spirit, neither will the
   Spirit do it without the means, where the means may be had. Wherefore,
   I pray you, do not you hinder him from using the means.

   Neo. Sir, for my own part, let him say what he will, I am resolved, by
   the assistance of God, to be careful and diligent in the use of these
   means which you have now prescribed; that so, by the increasing of my
   faith, I may be the better enabled to be subject to the will of the
   Lord, and so walk as that I may please him.

Chapter III, Section 10

   The distinction of the law of works, and law of Christ, applied to six
   paradoxes.

   But forasmuch as heretofore he hath endeavoured to persuade me to
   believe divers points, which then I could not see to be true, and
   therefore could not assent unto them, methinks I do now begin to see
   some show of truth in them; therefore, sir, if you please to give me
   leave, I will tell you what points they are, to the intent I may have
   your judgment and direction therein.

   Evan. Do so, I pray you.

   Neo. 1. Why, first of all, he hath endeavoured to persuade me that a
   believer is not under the law, but is altogether delivered from it.

   2. That a believer does not commit sin.

   3. That the Lord can see no sin in a believer.

   4. That the Lord is not angry with a believer for his sins.

   5. That the Lord doth not chastise a believer for his sins.

   6. Lastly, That a believer hath no cause neither to confess his sins,
   nor to crave pardon at the hands of God for them, neither yet to fast,
   nor mourn, nor humble himself before the Lord for them.

   Evan. These points which you have now mentioned have caused many
   needless and fruitless disputes; and that because men have either not
   understood what they have said, or else not declared whereof they have
   affirmed; for in one sense they may all of them be truly affirmed, and
   in another sense they may all of them be truly denied; whereof if we
   would clearly understand the truth, we must distinguish betwixt the law
   as it is the law of works, and as it is the law of Christ. [319]

   Now, as it is the law of works, it may be truly said, that a believer
   is not under the law, but is delivered from it, [320] according to that
   of the apostle, (Rom 6:14), "Ye are not under the law, but under
   grace"; and (Rom 7:6), "But now we are delivered from the law." And if
   believers be not under the law, but are delivered from the law, as it
   is a law of works, then, though they sin, yet do they not transgress
   the law of works; for "where no law is, there is no transgression,"
   (Rom 4:15). And therefore, says the apostle John, "Whosoever abideth in
   him sinneth not," (1 John 3:6); that is, as I conceive, whosoever
   abideth in Christ by faith, sinneth not against the law of works. [321]
   And if a believer sin not against the law of works, then can God see no
   sin in a believer, as a transgression of that law; [322] and therefore
   it is said, (Num 23:21), "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither
   hath he seen perverseness in Israel"; and again it is said, (Jer
   50:20), "At that time the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and
   there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be
   found": and in Canticles 4:7, Christ says concerning his spouse,
   "Behold thou art all fair, my love, and there is no spot in thee." And
   if God can see no sin in a believer, then assuredly he is neither angry
   nor doth chastise a believer for his sins, as a transgression of that
   law; [323] and hence it is, that the Lord says concerning his own
   people that were believers, (Isa 27:4), "Anger is not in me": and
   again, (Isa 54:9), the Lord speaking comfortably to has spouse the
   Church, says, "As I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go
   over the earth, so have I sworn that I will no more be wroth with thee,
   nor rebuke thee." Now, if the Lord be not angry with a believer,
   neither doth chastise him for his sins, as they are any transgression
   of the law of works, then hath a believer neither need to confess his
   sins unto God, nor to crave pardon for them, nor yet to fast, nor
   mourn, nor humble himself for them, as conceiving them to be any
   transgression of the law, as it is the law of works. [324] Thus you
   see, that if you consider the law in this sense, then all these points
   follow: according as you say our friend Antinomista hath endeavoured to
   persuade you.

   But if you consider the law, as it is the law of Christ, then they do
   not so, but quite contrary. For as the law is the law of Christ, it may
   be truly said, that a believer is under the law, and not delivered from
   it; according to that of the apostle, (1 Cor 9:21), "Being not without
   law to God, but under the law to Christ," and according to that of the
   same apostle, (Rom 3:31), "Do we then make void the law through faith?
   God forbid! yea, [by faith] we establish the law." And if a believer be
   under the law, and not delivered from it, as it is the law of Christ,
   then if he sin, he doth thereby transgress the law of Christ; and hence
   I conceive it is that the apostle John says, both concerning himself
   and other believers, (1 John 1:8), "If we say we have no sin, we
   deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us"; and so says the apostle
   James, chapter 3:2, "In many things we offend all." And if a believer
   transgress the law of Christ, then doubtless he seeth it: for it is
   said, (Prov 5:21), "that the ways of man are before the eyes of the
   Lord, and he pondereth all his goings"; and in Hebrews 4:13, it is
   said, "all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we
   have to do." And if the Lord sees the sins that a believer commits
   against the law, as it is the law of Christ, then doubtless he is angry
   with him; for it is said, (Psa 106:40), that because the people "went a
   whoring after their own inventions, therefore was the wrath of the Lord
   kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own
   inheritance"; and in Deuteronomy 1:37, Moses says concerning himself,
   "The Lord was angry with me." And if the Lord be angry with a believer
   for his transgressing the law of Christ, then assuredly, if need be, he
   will chastise him for it: for it is said, (Psa 89:30-32), concerning
   the seed and children of Jesus Christ, "If they forsake my law, and
   walk not in my judgments, then will I visit their transgressions with
   the rod, and their iniquities with stripes." And in 1 Corinthians
   11:30, it is said concerning believers, "For this cause," namely, their
   unworthy receiving of the sacrament, "many are weak and sickly among
   you, and many sleep." And if the Lord be angry with believers, and do
   chastise them for their sins, as they are a transgression of the law of
   Christ, then hath a believer cause to confess his sins unto the Lord,
   and to crave pardon for them, yea and to fast, and mourn, and humble
   himself for them, as conceiving them to be a transgression of the law
   of Christ. [325]

Chapter III, Section 11

   The use of that distinction in practice.

   And now, my loving neighbour Neophytus, I pray you, consider seriously
   of these things, and learn to distinguish aright betwixt the law, as it
   is the law of works, and as it is the law of Christ, and that in effect
   and practice; I mean, in heart and conscience.

   Neo. Sir, it is the unfeigned desire of my heart so to do; and
   therefore, I pray you, give me some direction therein. [326]

   Evan. Surely the best direction I can give you is, to labour truly to
   know, and firmly to believe, that you are not now under the law, as it
   is the law of works; and that you are now under the law as, it is the
   law of Christ; and that therefore you must neither hope for what the
   law of works promises, in case of your most exact obedience; nor fear
   what it threatens, in case of your most imperfect and defective
   obedience: and yet you may both hope for what the law of Christ
   promises, in case of your obedience, and are to fear what it threatens,
   in case of your disobedience.

   Neo. But, sir, what are these promises and threatenings? and, first, I
   pray you, tell me what it is that the law of works promises.

   Evan. The law of works, or, which is all one, as I have told you, the
   covenant of works, promises justification and eternal life to all that
   yield perfect obedience thereunto: and this you are not to hope for,
   because of your obedience. And indeed, to say as the thing is, you,
   being dead to the law of works, can yield no obedience at all unto it;
   for how can a dead wife yield any obedience to her husband? And if you
   can yield no obedience at all unto it, what hope can you have of any
   reward for your obedience? Nay, let me tell you more, Jesus Christ, the
   Son of God, hath purchased both justification and eternal life by his
   perfect obedience to the law of works, and hath freely given it to you,
   as it is written, (Acts 13:39), "By him all that believe are justified
   from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of
   Moses": and "Verily, verily," says our Saviour, "he that believeth in
   me hath everlasting life." (John 6:47)

   Neo. And I pray you, sir, what does the law of works threaten, in case
   of a man's disobedience unto it?

   Evan. Why, the penalty which the law of works, in that case, threatens,
   is condemnation and death eternal: and this you have no cause at all to
   fear, in case of your most defective obedience; for no man hath any
   cause to fear the penalty of that law which he lives not under. Surely
   a man that lives under the laws of England, has no cause to fear the
   penalties of the laws of Spain or France: even so you, that now live
   under the law of Christ, have no cause to fear the penalties of the law
   of works. [327] Nay, the law of works is dead to you; and therefore you
   have no more cause to fear the threats thereof, than a living wife has
   to fear the threats of her dead husband, [328] nay, than a dead wife
   has to fear the threats of a dead husband. Nay, let me say yet more,
   Jesus Christ, by his condemnation and death upon the cross, has
   delivered you and set you free from condemnation and eternal death; as
   it is written, (Rom 8:1), "There is therefore now no condemnation to
   them that are in Christ Jesus." And, says Christ himself, (John 11:26),
   "Whosoever liveth, and believeth in me, shall never die."

   And thus you see your freedom and liberty from the law as it is the law
   of works. And that you may be the better enabled to "stand fast in this
   liberty, wherewith Christ has made you free"; beware of conceiving that
   the Lord now stands in any relation to you, or will any way deal with
   you as a man under that law. So that if the Lord shall be pleased
   hereafter to bestow upon you a great measure of faith, whereby you
   shall be enabled to yield an exact and perfect obedience to the mind
   and will of God; [329] then beware of conceiving that the Lord looks
   upon it s obedience to the law of works, or will in any measure reward
   you for it, according to the promises of that law. And if in case, at
   any time hereafter, you be, by reason of weakness of your faith, and
   strength of temptation, drawn aside, and prevailed with to swerve from
   the mind and will of the Lord, then beware of conceiving that the Lord
   sees it as any transgression of the law of works. For if you cannot
   transgress that law, then it is impossible the Lord should see that
   which is not; and if the Lord can see no sin in you, as a transgression
   of the law of works, then it is impossible that he should either be
   angry with you, or correct you for any sin, as it is a transgression of
   that law. No, to speak with holy reverence, as I said before, the Lord
   cannot, by virtue of the covenant of works, either require any
   obedience of you, or give you an angry look, or any angry word; much
   less threaten and afflict you for any disobedience to that covenant.
   And, therefore, whensoever your conscience shall tell you, that you
   have broken any of the ten commandments, do not conceive that the Lord
   looks upon you as an angry Judge, armed with justice against you; much
   less do you fear that he will execute his justice upon you, according
   to the penalty of that covenant, in unjustifying of you, or depriving
   you of your heavenly inheritance, and giving you your portion in
   hell-fire. No, assure yourself that your God in Christ will never unson
   you, nor unspouse you: no, nor yet, as touching your justification and
   eternal salvation, will he love you ever a whit the less, though you
   commit ever so many or great sins; for this is a certain truth, that as
   no good either in you, or done by you, did move him to justify you, and
   give you eternal life, so no evil in you, or done by you, can move him
   to take it away from you, being once given. [330] And, therefore,
   believe it whilst you live, that as the Lord first loved you freely, so
   will he hereafter "heal your backslidings, and still love you freely,"
   (Hosea 14:4). Yea, "he will love you unto the end," (John 12:1). And
   although the Lord does express the fruits of his anger towards you, in
   chastising and afflicting of you, yet do not imagine that your
   afflictions are penal, proceeding from hatred, and vindictive justice;
   and so as payment and satisfaction for sins; and so as the beginning of
   eternal torments in hell; for you being, as you have heard, freed from
   the law of works, and so consequently from sinning against it, must
   needs likewise be freed from all wrath, anger, miseries, calamities,
   afflictions, yea, and from death itself, as [331] fruits and effects of
   any transgression against that covenant.

   And therefore you are never to confess your sins unto the Lord, as
   though you conceived them to have been committed against the law of
   works: and so making you liable to God's everlasting wrath, and hell-
   fire; neither must you crave pardon and forgiveness for them, that
   thereupon you may escape that penalty; neither do you either fast, or
   weep, or mourn, or humble yourself, from any belief that you shall
   thereby satisfy the justice of God, and appease his wrath, either in
   whole or in part, and so escape his everlasting vengeance. For if you
   be not under the law of works, and if the Lord see not sin in you as a
   transgression of that law, and be neither angry with you, nor afflict
   you for any sin, as it is a transgression of that law, then
   consequently you have no need either to confess your sins, or crave
   pardon for them, or fast, or weep, or mourn, or humble yourself for
   your sins, as conceiving them to be any transgression of the law of
   works.

   Neo. Well, sir, you have fully satisfied me in this point; and
   therefore, I pray you, proceed to show what is that reward which the
   law of Christ promises, which you said I might hope for, in case of my
   obedience thereunto.

   Evan. Why, the reward which I conceive the law of Christ promises to
   believers, and which they may hope for, answerably to their obedience
   to it, [332] is a comfortable being in the enjoyment of sweet communion
   with God and Christ, even in the time of this life, and a freedom from
   afflictions, both spiritual and corporeal, so far forth as they are
   fruits and effects of sin, as it is any transgression of the law of
   Christ. [333] For you know, that so long as a child does yield
   obedience to his father's commands, and does nothing that is
   displeasing to him, if he love his child, he will carry himself
   lovingly and kindly towards him, and suffer him to be familiar with
   him, and will not whip nor scourge him for his disobedience. Even so,
   if you unfeignedly desire and endeavour to be obedient unto the will
   and mind of your Father in Christ; in doing that which he commands, and
   in avoiding that which he forbids, both in your general and particular
   calling; and to the end that you may please him; then, answerably as
   you do so, your Father will smile upon you, when you shall draw near to
   him in prayer, or any other of his own ordinances; and manifest his
   sweet presence and loving favour towards you; and exempt you from all
   outward calamities except in case of trial of your faith and patience,
   or the like; as it was written, (2 Chron 15:2), "The Lord is with you,
   while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you."
   And so the apostle James says, (James 4:8), "Draw nigh to God, and he
   will draw nigh to you." And "Oh," says the Lord, "that my people had
   hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! he should have fed
   them with the finest of the wheat, and with honey out of the rock
   should I have satisfied thee," (Psa 81:13,16). And this may suffice to
   have shown you what you may hope for, answerably to your obedience to
   the law of Christ.

   Neo. Then, sir, I pray you, proceed to show what is the penalty which
   the law of Christ threatens, and which I am to fear, if I transgress
   that law.

   Evan. The penalty which the law of Christ threatens to you, if you
   transgress the law of Christ, and which you are to fear, is the want of
   near and sweet communion with God in Christ, even in the time of this
   life, and a liableness to all temporal afflictions, as fruits and
   effects of the transgressing of that law. [334]

   Wherefore, whensoever you shall hereafter transgress any of the ten
   commandments, you are to know that you have thereby transgressed the
   law of Christ, and that the Lord sees it and is angry with it, with a
   fatherly anger; and, if need be, will chastise you, (1 Peter 1:6),
   either with temporal or spiritual afflictions, or both. And this our
   heavenly Father will do in love to you; either to bring your sins to
   remembrance, as he did the sins of Joseph's brethren, (Gen 42:21), and
   as the widow of Zarephath confesseth concerning herself, (1 Kings
   17:18), or else "to purge or take away your sins," according to that
   which the Lord says, (Isa 27:9), "By this therefore shall the iniquity
   of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, even the taking away of
   sin." "For indeed," says Mr. Culverwell, "afflictions, through God's
   blessing, are made special means to purge out that sinful corruption
   which is still in the nature of believers; and therefore are they, in
   Scripture, most aptly compared to medicines, for so they are indeed to
   all God's children, most sovereign medicines to cure all their
   spiritual diseases." And indeed we have all of our great need thereof;
   for as Luther, on the Galatians, p. 66, truly says, "We are not yet
   perfectly righteous; for whilst we remain in this life, sin dwells
   still in the flesh, and this remnant of sin God purgeth."--"Wherefore,"
   says the same Luther in another place, [335] "When God hath remitted
   sins, and received a man into the bosom of grace, then doth he lay on
   him all kind of afflictions, and doth scour and renew him from day to
   day." And to the same purpose, Tindal truly says, "If we look on the
   flesh, and into the law, there is no man so perfect that is not found a
   sinner; nor no man so pure, that hath not need to be purged. And thus
   doth the Lord chastise believers to heal their natures, by purging out
   the corruption that remains therein."

   And therefore, whensoever you shall hereafter feel the Lord's
   chastening hand upon you, let it move you to take the prophet
   Jeremiah's counsel, that is, to "search and try your ways, and turn
   unto the Lord," (Lam 3:40), and confess your sins unto him, saying,
   with the prodigal, (Luke 15:21), "Father, I have sinned against heaven,
   and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son"; and beg
   pardon and forgiveness at his hands, as you are taught in the fifth
   petition of the Lord's prayer, (Matt 6:12). Yet do not you crave pardon
   and forgiveness at the hands of the Lord, as a malefactor doth at the
   hands of a judge, that feareth condemnation and death, as though you
   had sinned against the law of works, and therefore feared hell and
   damnation; but do you beg pardon and forgiveness as a child doth at the
   hands of his loving father; as feeling the fruits of his fatherly
   anger, in his chastising hand upon you; and as fearing the continuance
   and augmentation of the same, if your sin be not both pardoned and
   subdued: [336] and therefore do you also beseech your loving Father to
   subdue your iniquities, according to his promise, (Micah 7:19). And if
   you find not that the Lord hath heard your prayers, by your feeling
   your iniquities subdued, [337] then join with your prayers, fasting and
   weeping, if you can; that so you may be the more seriously humbled
   before the Lord, and more fervent in prayer. And this, I hope, may be
   sufficient to have showed you what is the penalty which the law of
   Christ threatens.

   Neo. O, but, sir, I should think myself a happy man, if I could be so
   obedient to the law of Christ, that he might have no need to inflict
   this penalty upon me.

   Evan. You say very well; but yet, whilst you carry this body of sin
   about you, do the best you can, there will be need that the Lord
   should, now and then, give you some fatherly corrections: but yet, this
   let me tell you, the more perfect your obedience is, the fewer lashes
   you shall have; "for the Lord doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve
   the children of men," (Lam 3:33). And therefore, according to my former
   exhortation, and your resolution, be careful to exercise your faith,
   and use all means to increase it; that so it may become effectual [338]
   working by love. (1 Thess 1:3, Gal 5:6) For, according to the measure
   of your faith, will be your true love to Christ and to his
   commandments; and according to your love to them, will be your delight
   in them, and your aptness and readiness to do them. And hence it is
   that Christ himself says, (John 14:15), "If ye love me, keep my
   commandments": and "this is the love of God," says that loving
   disciple, "that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not
   grievous," (1 John 5:3). Nay, the truth is, if you have this love in
   your hearts, it will be grievous unto you, that you cannot keep them as
   you would. Oh, if this love do abound in your heart, it will cause you
   to say with godly Joseph, in case you be tempted as he was, "How can I
   do this great wickedness, and so sin against God?" How can I do that
   which I know will displease so gracious a Father, and so merciful a
   Saviour? No, I will not do it; no, I cannot do it: no, you will rather
   say with the Psalmist, "I delight to do thy will, O my God! yea, thy
   law is within my heart," (Psa 40:8).

   Nay, let me tell you more, if this love of God in Christ be truly, and
   in any good measure, rooted in your heart; then, though the chastising
   hand of the Lord be not upon you, nay, though the Lord do no way
   express any anger towards you, yet if you but consider the Lord's ways
   towards you, and your ways towards him, you will mourn with a gospel-
   mourning, reasoning with yourself after this manner: Was I under the
   law of works by nature, and so, for every transgression against any of
   the ten commandments, made liable to everlasting damnation? and am I
   now, through the free mercy and love of God in Christ, brought under
   the law of Christ, and so subject to no other penalty for my
   transgressions, but fatherly and loving chastisements, which tend to
   the purging out of that sinful corruption that is in me? Oh what a
   loving Father is this! Oh what a gracious Saviour is this! Oh what a
   wretched man am I, to transgress the laws of such a good God, as he
   hath been to me! Oh the due consideration of this will even, as it
   were, melt your heart, and cause your eyes to drop with the tears of
   godly sorrow! yea, the due consideration of these things will cause you
   to "loathe yourself in your own sight for your transgressions", (Eze
   36:31), yea, not only to loathe yourself for them, but also to leave
   them, saying with Ephraim, "What have I to do any more with idols?"
   (Hosea 14:8) and to "cast them away as menstruous cloth, saying unto
   them, Get ye hence," (Isa 30:22). And truly you will desire nothing
   more, than that you might so live, as that you might never sin against
   the Lord any more. And this is that "goodness of God which," as the
   apostle says, "leadeth to repentance"; yea, this is that goodness of
   God which will lead you to a free obedience. So that if you do but
   apply the goodness of God in Christ to your soul, in any good measure,
   then will you answerably yield obedience to the law of Christ, not only
   without having respect either to what the law of works either promiseth
   or threateneth; but also without having respect to what the law of
   Christ either promiseth or threateneth; you will do that which the Lord
   commandeth, only because he commandeth it, and to the end that you may
   please him; and you will forbear when he forbids, only because he
   forbids it to the end that you may not displease him. [339] And this
   obedience is like unto that which our Saviour exhorts his disciples
   unto, (Matt 10:8), saying, "Freely ye have received, freely give." And
   this is to "serve the Lord without fear" of any penalty, which either
   the law of works or the law of Christ threateneth, "in holiness and
   righteousness all the days of your life," according to that saying of
   Zacharias, [340] (Luke 1:74,75). And this is to "pass the time of your
   sojourning here, in fear" of offending the Lord, by sinning against
   him: as the apostle Peter exhorts, (1 Peter 1:17). Yea, and this is to
   "serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear": as the author to
   the Hebrews exhorts, (Heb 12:28). And thus, my dear friend, Neophytus,
   I have endeavoured, according to your desire, to give you my judgment
   and direction in these points.

   Neo. And truly, sir, you have done it very effectually; the Lord enable
   me to practise according to your direction!

Chapter III, Section 12

   That distinction a mean betwixt legalism and Antinomianism.

   Nom. Sir, in this your answer to his question, you have also answered
   me, and given me full satisfaction in divers points, about which my
   friend Antinomista and I have had many a wrangling fit. For I used to
   affirm with tooth and nail, [as men use to say,] that believers are
   under the law, and not delivered from it; and that they do sin, and
   that God sees it, and is angry with them, and doth afflict them for it,
   and that, therefore, they ought to humble themselves, and mourn for
   their sins, and confess them, and crave pardon for them; and yet truly
   I must confess, I did not understand what I said, nor whereof I
   affirmed; and the reason was, because I did not know the difference
   betwixt the law, as it is the law of works, and as it is the law of
   Christ.

   Ant. And believe me, sir, I used to affirm, as earnestly as he, that
   believers are delivered from the law, and, therefore, do not sin; and,
   therefore, God can see no sin in them; and, therefore, is neither angry
   with them, nor does afflict them for sin; and, therefore, they have no
   need either to humble themselves, or mourn, or confess their sins, or
   beg pardon for them; the which I believing to be true, could not
   conceive how the contrary could be true also. But now I plainly see
   that by means of your distinguishing betwixt the law, as it is the law
   of works, and as it is the law of Christ, there is a truth in both.
   And, therefore, friend Nomista, whensoever either you, or any man else,
   shall hereafter affirm, that believers are under the law and do sin;
   and God sees it, and is angry with them, and does chastise them for it;
   and that they ought to humble themselves, mourn, weep, and confess
   their sins, and beg pardon for them: if you mean only, as they are
   under the law of Christ, I will agree with you, and never contradict
   you again.

   Nom. And truly, friend Antinomista, if either you, or any man else,
   shall hereafter affirm, that believers are delivered from the law, and
   do not sin, and God sees no sin in them, nor is angry with them, nor
   afflicts them for their sins, and that they have no need either to
   humble themselves, mourn, confess, or crave pardon for their sins; if
   you mean it only as they are not under the law of works, I will agree
   with you, and never contradict you again.

   Evan. I rejoice to hear you speak these words each to other: and truly,
   now I am in hope that you two will come back from both your extremes,
   and meet my neighbour Neophytus in the golden mean; having, as the
   apostle says, "the same love, being of one accord, and of one mind."

   Nom. Sir, for my own part, I thank the Lord I do now plainly see, that
   I have erred exceedingly, in seeking to be justified, "as it were, by
   the works of the law." [341] And yet could I never be persuaded to it
   before this day; and indeed should not have been persuaded to it now,
   had not you so plainly and fully handled this threefold law. And truly,
   sir, I do now unfeignedly desire to renounce myself, and all that ever
   I have done, and by faith to adhere only to Jesus Christ; for now I see
   that he is all in all. Oh, that the Lord would enable me so to do! And
   I beseech you, sir, pray for me.

   Ant. And truly, sir, I must needs confess, that I have erred as much on
   the other hand; for I have been so far from seeking to be justified by
   the works of the law, that I have neither regarded law nor works. But
   now I see mine error; I purpose, God willing, to reform it.

   Evan. The Lord grant that you may.

Chapter III, Section 13

   How to attain to assurance.

   But how do you, neighbour Neophytus; for methinks you look very
   heavily.

   Neo. Truly, sir, I was thinking of that place of Scripture, where the
   apostle exhorts us "to examine ourselves whether we be in the faith or
   no," (2 Cor 13:5); whereby it seems to me, that a man may think he is
   in the faith, when he is not. Therefore, sir, I would gladly hear how I
   may be sure that I am in the faith.

   Evan. I would not have you to make any question of it, since you have
   grounded your faith upon such a firm foundation as will never fail you;
   for the promise of God in Christ is of a tried truth, and never yet
   failed any man, nor ever will. [342] Therefore I would have you to
   close with Christ in the promise, without making any question whether
   you are in the faith or no; for there is an assurance which rises from
   the exercise of faith by a direct act, and that is, when a man, by
   faith, directly lays hold upon Christ, and concludes assurance from
   thence. [343]

   Neo. Sir, I know that the foundation whereon I am to ground my faith
   remains sure; and I think I have already built thereon; but yet,
   because I conceive a man may think he has done so when he has not,
   therefore, would I fain know how I may be assured that I have so done?
   [344]

   Evan. Well, now I understand you what you mean; it seems you do not
   want a ground for your believing, but for your believing that you have
   believed. [345]

   Neo. Yea, indeed, that is the thing I want.

   Evan. Why, the next way to find out and know this is to look back and
   reflect upon your own heart, and consider what actions have passed
   through there; for indeed this is the benefit that a reasonable soul
   has, that it is able to return upon itself, to see what it has done;
   which the soul of a beast cannot do. Consider, then, I pray you, that
   you have been convinced in your spirit that you are a sinful man, and,
   therefore, have feared the Lord's wrath and eternal damnation in hell;
   and you have been convinced that there is no help for you at all in
   yourself, by anything that you can do; and you heard it plainly proved,
   that Jesus Christ alone is an all-sufficient help; and the free and
   full promise of God in Christ has been made so plain and clear to you,
   that you had nothing to object why Christ did not belong to you in
   particular; [346] and you have perceived a willingness in Christ to
   receive you, and to embrace you as his beloved spouse; and you have
   thereupon consented and resolved to take Christ, and to give yourself
   unto him, whatsoever betides you; and I am persuaded you have thereupon
   felt a secret persuasion in your heart, that God in Christ doth bear a
   love to you; and answerably your heart hath been inflamed towards him
   in love again, manifesting itself in an unfeigned desire to be obedient
   and subject to his will in all things, and never to displease him in
   anything. Now tell me, I pray you, and truly, whether you have not
   found these things in you, as I have said?

   Neo. Yea, indeed, I hope I have in some measure.

   Evan. Then I tell you truly, you have a sure ground to lay your
   believing that you have believed upon; and, as the apostle John says,
   "Hereby you may know that you are of the truth, and may assure your
   heart thereof before God," (1 John 3:19).

   Neo. Surely, sir, this I can truly say, that heretofore, when I have
   thought upon my sins, I have conceived of God and Christ, as of a
   wrathful judge that would condemn all unrighteous men to eternal death:
   and, therefore, when I have thought upon the day of judgment, and hell
   torments, I have even trembled for fear, and have, as it were, even
   hated God. And though I have laboured to become righteous, that I might
   escape his wrath, yet all that I did, I did it unwillingly. But since I
   have heard you make it so plain, that a sinner that sees and feels his
   sins is to conceive of God, as of a merciful, loving, and forgiving
   Father in Christ, that hath committed all judgment to his Son, who came
   not to condemn men but to save them; methinks I do not now fear his
   wrath, but do rather apprehend his love towards me; whereupon my heart
   is inflamed towards him with such love, that, methinks, I would
   willingly do or suffer anything that I knew would please him; and would
   rather choose to suffer any misery than I would do anything that I knew
   were displeasing to him.

   Evan. We read in the seventh chapter of Luke's gospel, that when that
   sinful yet believing woman did manifest her faith in Christ by her love
   to him, in "washing his feet with her tears, and wiping them with the
   hairs of her head," (verse 38), he said unto Simon the Pharisee, (verse
   47), "I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are forgiven her, for
   she loved much"; even so I may say unto you, Nomista, in the same words
   concerning our neighbour Neophytus. And to you yourself, Neophytus, I
   say, as Christ said unto the woman, (verse 48-50), "Thy sins are
   forgiven thee, thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace."

   Ant. But I pray you, sir, is to this his reflecting upon himself to
   find out a ground to lay his believing that he hath believed upon, a
   turning back from the covenant of grace to the covenant of works, and
   from Christ to himself?

   Evan. Indeed, if he should look upon these things in himself, and
   thereon conclude, that because he has done this, God had accepted of
   him, and justified him, and will save him, and so make them the ground
   of his believing; this were to turn back from the covenant of grace to
   the covenant of works, and from Christ to himself. But if he look upon
   these things in himself, and thereupon conclude, that because these
   things are in his heart, Christ dwells there by faith, and therefore he
   is accepted of God, and justified, and shall certainly be saved, and so
   make them an evidence of his believing, or the ground of his believing
   that he has believed; this is neither to turn back from the covenant of
   grace to the covenant of works, nor from Christ to himself. So that
   these things in his heart being the daughters of faith, and the
   offspring of Christ, though they cannot at first produce, or bring
   forth their mother, yet may they in time of need nourish her.

Chapter III, Section, 14

   Marks and evidences of true faith.

   Nom. But, I pray you, sir, are there not other things besides these,
   that he says he finds in himself, that a man may look upon as evidences
   of his believing, or, as you call them, as grounds to believe that he
   has believed?

   Evan. Yea, indeed, there are divers other effects of faith, which if a
   man have in him truly, he may look upon them as evidences that he hath
   truly believed; and I will name three of them unto you:

   Whereof the first is, when a man truly loves the word of God, and makes
   a right use of it; and this a man does, First, when he hungers and
   thirsts after the word, as after the food of his soul, desiring it at
   all times, even as he does his "appointed [347] food," (Job 23:12).
   Secondly, when he desires and delights to exercise himself therein day
   and night, that is, constantly, (Psa 1:2). Thirdly, when he receives
   the word of God as the word of God, and not as the word of man, (1
   Thess 2:13); setting his heart, in the time of hearing or reading it,
   as in God's presence: and being affected with it, as if the Lord
   himself should speak unto him being most affected with that ministry,
   or that portion of God's word, which shows him his sins, and searches
   out his most secret corruptions; denying his own reason and affections:
   yea, and his profits and pleasures, in anything when the Lord shall
   require it of him. Fourthly, This a man does, when he makes the word of
   God to be his chief comfort in the time of his afflictions; finding it,
   at that time, to be the main stay and solace of his heart, (Psa
   119:49,50).

   The second evidence is, when a man truly loves the children of God, (1
   John 5:1); that is, all godly and religious persons, above all other
   sorts of men; and that is, when he loves them not for carnal respects,
   but for the graces of God which he sees in them, (2 John 1:2, 3 John
   1). And when he delights in their society and company, and makes them
   his only companions, (Psa 119:63), and when his well-doing [to his
   power] extends itself to them, (Psa 16:3). In being pitiful and
   tender-hearted towards them, and in gladly receiving of them, and
   communicating to their necessities with a ready mind, (Phile 7, 1 John
   3:17). And when he has not the glorious faith of Christ in "respect of
   persons," (James 2:1,2), but can make himself equal to them of the
   lower sort, (Rom 12;16); and when he loves them at all times, even when
   they are in adversity, as poverty, disgrace, sickness, or otherwise in
   misery.

   The third evidence is, when a man can truly love his enemies, (Matt
   6:14). And that he does, when he can pray heartily for them, and
   forgive them their particular trespasses against him; being more
   grieved for that they have sinned against God than for that they have
   wronged him; and when he can forbear them, and yet could be revenged of
   them, either by bringing shame and misery upon them, (1 Peter 3:9, Rom
   12:14); and when he strives to overcome their evil with goodness, being
   willing to help them, and relieve them in their misery, and do them any
   good in soul or body; and, lastly, when he can freely and willingly
   acknowledge his enemy's just praise, even as if he were his dearest
   friend.

Chapter III, Section 15

   How to recover lost evidences.

   Neo. But, sir, I pray you, let me ask you one question more touching
   this point; and that is, suppose that hereafter I should see no outward
   evidences, and question whether I had ever any true inward evidences,
   and so whether ever I did truly believe or no, what must I do then?

   Evan. Indeed it is possible you may come to such a condition; and
   therefore you do well to provide beforehand for it. Now then, if ever
   it shall please the Lord to give you over to such a condition, first,
   let me warn you to take heed of forcing and constraining yourself to
   yield obedience to God's commandments, to the end you may so get an
   evidence of faith again, or a ground to lay your believing, that you
   have believed, upon; and so forcibly to hasten your assurance before
   the time: [348] for although this be not to turn quite back to the
   covenant of works, [for that you shall never do,] yet it is to turn
   aside towards that covenant, as Abraham did, who, after that he had
   long waited for the promised seed, though he was before justified by
   believing the free promise, yet, for the more speedy satisfying of his
   faith, he turned aside to go in to Hagar, who was, as you have heard, a
   type of the covenant of works. So that you see, this is not the right
   way; but the right way for you, in this case, to get your assurance
   again, is, when all other things fail, to look to Christ; that is, go
   to the word and promise, and leave off and cease awhile to reason about
   the truth of your faith; and set your heart on work to believe, as if
   you had never yet done it; saying in your heart, Well, Satan, suppose
   my faith has not been true hitherto, yet now will I begin to endeavour
   after true faith; and therefore, O Lord, here I cast myself upon thy
   mercy afresh, for in thee the fatherless find mercy, (Hosea 14:3).
   Thus, I say, hold to the word; go not away, but keep you here, and you
   shall bring forth fruit with patience, [349] (Luke 8:15).

Chapter III, Section 16

   Marks and signs of union with Christ.

   Neo. Well, sir, you have fully satisfied me concerning that point: but
   as I remember, it follows in the same verse, "Know ye not your own
   selves, how that Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates"? (2 Cor
   13:5). Wherefore, I desire to hear how a man may know that Jesus Christ
   is in him.

   Evan. Why, if Christ be in a man, he lives in him: as says the apostle,
   "I live not but Christ liveth in me."

   Neo. But how, then, shall a man know, that Christ lives in him?

   Evan. Why, in what man soever Christ lives according to the measure of
   his faith, he executes his threefold office in him, viz: his
   prophetical, priestly, and kingly office.

   Neo. I desire to hear more of this threefold office of Christ; and
   therefore, I pray you, sir, tell me, first, how a man may know that
   Christ executes his prophetical office in him?

   Evan. Why, so far forth as any man hears and knows that there was a
   covenant made betwixt God and all mankind in Adam; and that it was an
   equal covenant, and that God's justice must needs enter, [350] upon the
   breach of it; and that all mankind, for that cause, were liable to
   eternal death and damnation; so that if God had condemned all mankind,
   yet had it but been the sentence of an equal and just judge, seeking
   rather the execution of his justice, than man's ruin and destruction;
   and thereupon takes it home, and applies it particularly to himself,
   (Job 5:27), and so is convinced that he is a miserable, lost, and
   helpless man; I say, so far forth as a man does this, Christ executes
   his prophetical office in him, in teaching him, and revealing unto him
   the covenant of works. And, so far forth as any man hears and knows
   that God made a covenant with Abraham, and all his believing seed in
   Jesus Christ, offering him freely to all to whom the sound of the
   gospel comes, and giving him freely to all that receive him by faith;
   and so justifies them, and saves them eternally; and thereupon has his
   heart opened to receive this truth, not as a man takes an object or a
   theological point into his head, whereby he is only made able to
   discourse: but as an habitual and practical point, receiving it into
   his "heart by the faith of the gospel," (Phil 1:27), and applying it to
   himself, and laying his eternal state upon it; and so setting to his
   seal, that God is true: I say, so far forth as a man does this, Christ
   executes his prophetical office in him, in teaching him and revealing
   to him the covenant of grace. And so far forth as any man hears and
   knows, that "this is the will of God, even his sanctification," (1
   Thess 4:3), and thereupon concludes, that it is his duty to endeavour
   after it; I say, so far forth as a man does this, Christ executes his
   prophetical office in him, in teaching and revealing his law to him.
   And this I hope is sufficient for answer to your first question.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, in the second place, tell me, how a man may know
   that Christ executes his priestly office in him?

   Evan. Why, so far forth as any man hears and knows that Christ has
   given himself, as that only absolute and perfect sacrifice for the sins
   of believers, (Heb 9:26), and joined them unto himself by faith, and
   himself unto them by his Spirit, and so made them one with him; and is
   now "entered into heaven itself, to appear in the presence of God for
   them," (Heb 9:24); and hereupon is emboldened to go immediately to
   [351] God in prayer, as to a father, and meet him in Christ, and
   present him with Christ himself, as with a sacrifice without spot or
   blemish; I say, so far forth as any man does this, Christ executes his
   priestly office in him.

   Neo. But sir, would you have a believer to go immediately unto God? How
   then does Christ make intercession for us at God's right hand, as the
   apostle says he does? (Rom 8:34)

   Evan. It is true indeed, Christ, as a public person, representing all
   believers, appears before God his Father; and willeth according to both
   his natures, and desires as he is a man, that God would, for his
   satisfaction's sake, grant unto them whatsoever "they ask according to
   his will." But yet you must go immediately to God in prayer for all
   that. [352]

   You must not pitch your prayers upon Christ, and terminate them there,
   as if he were to take them, and present them to his Father; but the
   very presenting place of your prayers must be God himself in Christ.
   Neither must you conceive, as though Christ the Son were more willing
   to grant your request than God the Father, for whatsoever Christ
   willeth, the same also the Father, being well pleased with him,
   willeth. In Christ, therefore, I say, and no where else, must you
   expect to have your petitions granted; and as in Christ and no place
   else, so for Christ's sake, and nothing else. And therefore I beseech
   you to beware you forget not Christ when you go unto the Father to beg
   anything you desire, either for yourself or others; especially when you
   desire to have any pardon for sin, you are not to think, that when you
   join with your prayers, fasting, weeping, and afflicting of yourself,
   that for so doing you shall prevail with God to hear you, and grant
   your petitions; no, no, you must meet God in Christ, and present him
   with his sufferings; your eye, your mind, and all your confidence, must
   be therein; and in that be as confident as possible you can; yea,
   expostulate the matter, as it were, with God the Father, and say, "Lo;
   here is the person that has well deserved it; here is the person that
   wills and desires it; in whom thou hast said thou art well pleased;
   yea, here is the person that has paid the debt, and discharged the bond
   for all my sins; and, therefore, O Lord! now it stands with thy justice
   to forgive me." And thus, if you do, why, then you may be assured that
   Christ executes his priestly office in you.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, in the third place, show me how a man may know
   that Christ executes his kingly office in him?

   Evan. Why, so far forth as any man hears and knows "that all power is
   given unto Christ, both in heaven and on earth," (Matt 28:18); both to
   vanquish and to overcome all the lusts and corruptions of believers,
   and to write his law in their hearts; and hereupon takes occasions to
   go unto Christ for the doing of both in him; I say, so far forth as he
   does this, why Christ executes his kingly office in him.

   Neo. Why then, sir, it seems that the place where Christ executes his
   kingly office, is in the hearts of believers?

   Evan. It is true indeed; for Christ's kingdom is not temporal or
   secular over the natural lives or civil negotiations of men; but his
   kingdom is spiritual and heavenly, over the souls of men, to awe and
   over-rule the hearts, to captivate the affections, to bring into
   obedience the thoughts, and to subdue and pull down strong holds. For
   when our father Adam transgressed, he and we, all of us, forsook God,
   and chose the devil for our lord and king; so that every mother's child
   of us is, by nature, under the government of Satan; and he rules over
   us, till Christ come into our hearts, and dispossess him; according to
   the saying of Christ himself, (Luke 11:21,22), "When a strong man armed
   keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace": that is, says Calvin,
   Satan holds them that are in subjection to him in such bonds and quiet
   possession, that he rules over them without resistance; but when Christ
   comes to dwell in any man's heart by faith; according to the measure of
   faith, he dispossesses him, and seats himself in the heart, and roots
   out, and pulls down all that withstands his government there; and, as a
   valiant captain, he stands upon his guard, and enables the soul to
   gather together all its forces and powers, to resist and withstand all
   its and his enemies, and so set itself in good earnest against them,
   when they at any time offer to return again; and he doth especially
   enable the soul to resist, and set itself against the principal enemy,
   even that which does most oppose Christ in his government; so that
   whatsoever lust or corruption is in a believer's heart or soul as most
   predominant, Christ enables him to take that into his mind, and to have
   most revengeful thoughts against it, and to make complaints to him
   against it, and to desire power and strength from him against it, and
   all because it most withstands the government of Christ, and is the
   rankest traitor to Christ; so that he uses all the means he can to
   bring it before the judgment-seat of Christ, and there he calls for
   justice against it, saying, "O Lord Jesus Christ, here is a rebel and a
   traitor, that does withstand thy government in me, wherefore, I pray
   thee, come and execute thy kingly office in me, and subdue it; yea,
   vanquish and overcome it." Whereupon Christ gives the same answer that
   he gave to the centurion, "Go thy way, and as thou hast believed, so be
   it done unto thee," [353] (Matt 8:13).

   And as Christ doth thus suppress all other governors but himself in the
   hart of a believer, so doth he raze out and deface all other laws, and
   writes his own there, according to his promise, (Jer 31:33), and makes
   them pliable and willing to do and suffer his will; and that because it
   is his will. So that the mind and will of Christ, laid down in his
   word, and manifested in his works, is not only the rule of a believer's
   obedience, but also the reason of it, as I once heard a godly minister
   say in the pulpit; so that he does not only do that which is Christ's
   will, but he does it because it is his will.

   Oh that man, which hath the law of Christ written in his heart!
   according to the measure of it, he reads, he hears, he prays, he
   receives the sacrament, he keeps the Lord's day holy, he exhorts, he
   instructs, he confers, and does all the duties that belong to him in
   his general calling, because he knows it is the mind and will of Christ
   he should do so! yea, he patiently suffers, and willingly undergoes
   afflictions for the cause of Christ, because he knows it is the will of
   Christ; yea, such a man does not only yield obedience, and perform the
   duties of the first table of the law, by virtue of Christ's command,
   but of the second also. Oh that husband, parent, master, or magistrate,
   that has the law of Christ written in his heart! he does his duty to
   his wife, child, servant, or subject, willingly and uprightly, because
   Christ requires it and commands it. And so that wife, child, servant,
   or subject, that has the law of Christ written in his or her heart,
   they do their duties to husband, parent, master, or governor, freely
   and cheerfully, because their Lord Christ commands it. Now, then, if
   you find these things in your heart, you may conclude that Christ rules
   and reigns there, as Lord and King.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [256] The author here teaches, that the matter of the law of works and
   of the law of Christ, is one, namely, the ten commandments, commonly
   called the moral law. And that this law of the ten commandments was
   given of God, and so of divine authority, to be a rule of righteousness
   for men to walk by; a true rule agreeable in all things to the divine
   nature and will; an eternal rule, indispensable, ever to continue,
   without interruption for any one moment; and that for all men, good,
   bad, saints and sinners, of all nations, Jews and Gentiles, and at all
   times, in all ages, from the moment of man's creation, before the fall,
   and after the fall; before the covenant of works, under the covenant of
   works, and under the covenant of grace, in its several periods. Thus he
   asserts this great truth, in terms used by orthodox divines, but with a
   greater variety of expression than is generally used upon this head,
   the which serves to inculcate it in the more. And speaking of the ten
   commandments, he declares in these words. "That neither hath Christ
   delivered believers any otherwise from them, than as they are the
   covenant of works. The scope of this part of the book, is to show that
   believers ought to receive them as the law of Christ, whom we believe
   to be with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, the eternal Jehovah, the
   Supreme, the most High God; and consequently as a law having a
   commanding power, and binding force, upon the believer, from the
   authority of God, and not as a simple passive rule, like a workman's
   rule, that hath no authority over him, to command and bind him to
   follow its direction. Nay, our author owns the ten commandments to be a
   law to believers, as well as others, again and again commanding,
   requiring, forbidding, reproving, condemning sin, to which believers
   must yield obedience, and fenced with a penalty, which transgressing
   believers are to fear, as being under the law to Christ." These things
   are so manifest, that it is quite beyond my reach to conceive how, from
   the author's doctrine on this head, and especially from the passage we
   are now upon, it can be inferred that he teaches, that the believer is
   not under the law as a rule of life; or can be affirmed that he does
   not acknowledge the law's commanding power, and binding force upon the
   believer, but makes it a simple passive rule to him; unless the meaning
   be, that the author teaches, "That the believer is not under the
   covenant of works as a rule of life"? or, "that the law, as it is the
   covenant of works, is not a rule of life to the believer; and that he
   does not acknowledge the commanding power, and binding force of the
   covenant of works upon the believer; nor that obedience is commanded
   him upon the pain of the curse, and bound upon him with the cords of
   the threatening of eternal death in hell." For, otherwise, it is
   evident that he teaches the law of the ten commandments to be a rule of
   life to a believer, and to have a commanding and binding power over
   him. Now, if these be errors, the author is undoubtedly guilty; and if
   his sentiments on these heads were proposed in those terms, as the
   thing itself doth require, no wrong would be done him therein. But that
   these are gospel-truths, appears from what is already said: and the
   contrary doctrines do all issue out of the womb of that dangerous
   position, "That the believer is not set free both from the commanding
   and condemning power of the covenant of works,"--of which before.

   [257] These texts are adduced to show, that they to whom the law of the
   ten commandments is given, as the law of Christ, are those who have
   already received life, even life that shall never end; and that of
   God's free gift, before they were capable of doing good works; who
   therefore need not to work for life, but from life. "The preface to the
   ten commandments teaches us, that because God is the LORD, and our GOD,
   and REDEEMER, therefore we are bound to keep all his commandments."
   (Luke 1:74), "That we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies,
   might serve him without fear."--(1 Peter 1:15), "As he that hath called
   you is holy, so be ye holy; because it is written, Be ye holy for I am
   holy. Forasmuch as ye know, that ye were not redeemed with corruptible
   things--but with the precious blood of Christ." Short. Cat. with the
   Scriptures at large.

   [258] Of this penalty of the law of Christ, the author treats
   afterwards.

   [259] To direct the believer how to receive the law of the ten
   commandments with application to himself, he assigns this difference
   betwixt the law of works and the law of Christ. the one, namely, the
   law of works, is the law of the ten commandments, but supposed to be
   delivered by God as he is Creator out of Christ; and so standing in
   relation to man, only as Creator, not as Redeemer; the other, namely,
   the law of Christ, is the same law of the ten commandments, but
   supposed to be delivered by God, as he is not only Creator but Redeemer
   in Christ. And although the notion of Creator doth not imply that of
   Redeemer, yet the latter implies the former; as he is Redeemer, he is
   sovereign Lord Creator, else we are yet in our sins, for none of
   inferiour dignity could remove our offence or guilt; but the word of
   truth secures this foundation of believers' safety and comfort; (Isa
   44:6,24), "Thus saith the Lord, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer,
   the Lord of hosts, I am the First, and I am the Last, and besides me
   there is no God. Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, and He that formed
   thee from the womb, I am the Lord that maketh all things, that
   stretcheth forth the heavens alone, that spreadeth abroad the earth by
   myself."--(54:5), "Thy Maker is thine Husband." Now, the law of the ten
   commandments is given, the former way, only to unbelievers, or such as
   are out of Christ, the latter way to believers, or such as are in
   Christ. And to prove whether this be a vain distinction or not, one
   needs but to consult the conscience, when thoroughly awakened, whether
   it is all a case to it, to receive the law of the ten commandments in
   the thunders from Mount Sinai, or in the still small voice, out of the
   tabernacle, that is, from an absolute God, or from a God in Christ. It
   is true, unbelievers are not under the law, as it is the law of Christ;
   and that is their misery, even as it is the misery of the slaves, that
   the commands of the master of the family, though the matter of them be
   the very same to them, and to the children, yet they are not fatherly
   commands to them, as they are to the children, but purely masterly. And
   they are not hereby freed from any duty, within the compass of the
   perfect law of the ten commandments; for these commands are the matter
   of the law of works, as well as of the law of Christ. Neither are they
   thereby exempted from Christ's authority and jurisdiction, since the
   law of works is his law, as he is with the Father and the Holy Ghost,
   the Sovereign Lord Creator: yea, and even as Mediator, he rules in the
   midst of his enemies, and over them, with a rod of iron.

   [260] The receiving of the ten commandments at the hands of Christ, is
   here opposed, (1.) To the receiving of them at the hands of God out of
   Christ. (2.) To the receiving of them at the hands of Moses, namely, as
   our Lawgiver. The first is a receiving of them immediately from God,
   without a Mediator; and so receiving of them as the law of works. The
   second is a receiving of them from Christ, the true Mediator, yet
   immediately by the intervention of a typical one, and so is a receiving
   of them as a law of Moses, the typical Mediator, who delivered them
   from the ark or tabernacle. To this it is, and not to the delivering of
   them from Mount Sinai, that the author doth here look, as is evident
   from his own words. The former manner of receiving them is not
   agreeable to the state of real believers, since they never were, nor
   are given in that manner to believers in Christ, but only to
   unbelievers, whether under the Old or New Testament. The latter is not
   agreeable to the state of New Testament believers, since the true
   Mediator is come, and is sealed of the Father, as the great Prophet, to
   whom Moses must give place, (Matt 17:5, Acts 3:22). See Turret. loc.
   11. q. 24, th. 15. However, the not receiving of Moses as the lawgiver
   of the Christian church, carries no prejudice to the honour of that
   faithful servant; nor to the receiving of his writings, as the word of
   God, they being of divine inspiration, yea, and the fundamental divine
   revelation.

   [261] This plainly concludes, that to receive the law of the ten
   commandments from God, as Creator out of Christ, is to receive them as
   the law [or covenant] of works; unless men will fancy, that after God
   hath made two covenants, the one of works, the other of grace, he will
   yet deal with them neither in the way of the one, nor of the other.

   [262] Calling the ten commandments but the substance of the law of
   nature, he plainly intimates, that they were not the whole of that law,
   but that the law of nature had a penal sanction. Compare his speaking
   of the same ten commands, still as the substance of the law of works,
   and of the law of Christ. Indeed, he is not of opinion, that a penal
   sanction is inseparable from the law of nature. That would put the
   glorified saints, and confirmed angels in heaven, [to say nothing
   more,] under a penal sanction too; for without question, they are, and
   will remain for ever, under the law of nature. The truth is, the law of
   nature is suited both to the nature of God, and to the nature of the
   creature; and there is no place for a penal sanction, where there is no
   possibility of transgression.

   [263] The ten commands being the substance of the law of nature, a
   representation of God's image, and a beam of his holiness, behoved for
   ever unalterably to be a rule of life to mankind, in all possible
   states, conditions, and circumstances; nothing but the utter
   destruction of human nature, and its ceasing to be, could divest them
   of that office, since God is unchanging in his image and holiness.
   Hence, their being a rule of life to Adam and his posterity, had no
   dependence on their becoming the covenant of works; but they would have
   been that rule, though there never had been any such covenant: yea,
   whatever covenant was introduced, whether of works or of grace,
   whatever form might be put upon them, they behoved still to remain the
   rule of life; no covenant, no form whatsoever, could ever prejudice
   this their royal dignity. Now, whether this state of the matter, or
   their being the covenant of works, which was merely accessory to them,
   and might never have been at all, is the firmer foundation, to build
   their being a rule of life upon, is no hard question to determine.

   [264] And would have been so always to them all, till they had
   perfectly fulfilled that covenant, had they not been divested of that
   form, unto believers, through Jesus Christ their surety. To them they
   remain to be a rule of life, but not under the form of the covenant of
   works; but to unbelievers they are, and still will be, a rule of life
   under that form.

   [265] And to them. One will not think strange to hear, that the ten
   commands were, as it were, razed out of man's heart by the fall, if one
   considers the spirituality and vast extent of them, and that they were,
   in their perfection engraven on the heart of man, in his creation, and
   doth withal take notice of the ruin brought on man by the fall. Hereby
   he indeed lost the very knowledge of the law of nature, if the ten
   commands are to be reckoned, as certainly they are, the substance and
   matter of that law; although he lost it not totally, but some remains
   thereof were left with him. Concerning these the apostle speaks, (Rom
   1:19,20, 2:14,15). And our author teaches expressly, that the law is
   partly known by nature, that is, in its corrupt state. And here he
   says, not simply, that the ten commandments were razed, though in
   another case he speaks after that manner, where yet it is evident he
   means not a razing quite; but he says, "They were, as it were, razed."
   But what are these remains of them in comparison with that body of
   natural laws, fairly written, and deeply engraven, on the heart of
   innocent Adam? If they were not, as it were, razed, what need is there
   of writing a new copy of them in the hearts of the elect, according to
   the promise of the new covenant? "I will put my laws into their hearts,
   and in their minds will I write them," (Heb 10:16, 8:10, Jer 31:33).
   What need was there of writing them in the book of the Lord, the Bible,
   in which they were made known again to us, as they were to Adam and the
   believing fathers, the author speaks of, by visions and revelations?
   the latter being as necessary to them as the former is to us, for that
   end, since these supplied to them the want of the Scriptures. As for
   those, who neither had these visions and revelations given to
   themselves, nor the doctrine thereby taught communicated to them by
   others, it is manifest they could have no more knowledge of those laws,
   than was to be found among the ruins of mankind in the fall.

   [266] The former, the giver of the law, the latter the restorer of it.

   [267] "Which words establish Christ as the only doctor and teacher of
   his church; the only one whom he had betrusted to deliver his truths
   and will to his people; the only one to whom Christians are to
   hearken," Sup. to Poole's Annot. on Matthew 17:5.

   [268] "Wives, submit yourselves unto your husbands as unto the Lord,"
   (Eph 5:22).

   [269] Whether or not this be sufficient to prove them to be the law of
   Christ, having a divine, authoritative, binding power on men's
   consciences, notwithstanding of the term doctrines here used by the
   author, one may judge from these texts: (Matt 7:28,29), "The people
   were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as one having
   authority, and not as the scribes."--(John 7:16), "My doctrine is not
   mine, but His that sent me."--(Heb 1:1-3), "God, who at sundry times,
   and in divers manners, spake in time past unto the fathers, by the
   prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
   hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; who
   being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his
   person," &c.--(Matt 27:18-20), "All power is given unto me in heaven
   and earth: go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, to observe all
   things whatsoever I have commanded you." The original word, in the Old
   Testament, rendered law, doth properly signify a doctrine, Hence, (Matt
   15:9), "Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men," i.e., the laws
   and commands of men, for the laws and commands of God. Compare verses
   4-6.

   [270] That is, the law of the ten commandments, commonly called the
   moral law, as it is the law of Christ, neither justifies nor condemns
   men's persons in the sight of God. How can it do either the one or the
   other as such, since to be under it, as it is the law of Christ, is the
   peculiar privilege of believers, already justified by grace, and set
   beyond the reach of condemnation; according to that of the apostle,
   (Rom 8:1), "There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them which are
   in Christ Jesus"? But to say that this makes the law of Christ
   despicable, is to forget the sovereign authority of God in him, his
   matchless love in dying for sinners, the endearing relations wherein he
   stands to his people, and upon the one hand, the enjoyment of actual
   communion and fellowship with God, and the many precious tokens of his
   love, to be conferred on them, in the way of close walking with God;
   and upon the other hand, the want of that communion and fellowship, and
   the many fearful tokens of his anger against them for their sins. [See
   sec. 11.] All these belong to the law of Christ, and will never be
   despicable in the eyes of any gracious soul; though I doubt if ever
   hell and damnation were more despised in the eyes of others, than they
   are at this day, wherein believers and unbelievers are set so much on a
   level with respect to these awful things. As to the point of
   condemnation, it is evident from Scripture, that no law can condemn
   those "who are in Christ Jesus," (Rom 8:1,33,34). And the law, as it is
   the covenant of works, condemns all those who are not in Christ, but
   under the law. (Gal 3:10, Rom 3:19) And particularly, it condemns every
   unbeliever, whose condemnation will be fearfully aggravated by his
   rejection of the gospel offer; the which rejected offer will be a
   witness against him in the judgment; in respect whereof our Lord says,
   (John 12:48), "The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in
   the last day." Compare (15:22), "If I had not come and spoken unto
   them, they had not had sin; but now they have no cloak for their sin."
   Therefore the law, which unbelievers still remain under, as a covenant
   of works, will condemn them with a double condemnation. (John 3:18),
   "He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
   believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And hence it
   appears that there is as little need of, as there is warrant for, a
   condemning gospel. The holy Scripture states it as the difference
   betwixt the law and the gospel, that the former is the ministration of
   condemnation and death, the latter, the ministration of righteousness
   and life." (2 Cor 3:6-9) Compare (John 12:47), "If any man hear my
   words, and believe not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge the
   world, but to save the world." As to the point of justification; no man
   is, nor can be justified by the law. It is true, the Neonomians or
   Baxterians, to wind in a righteousness of our own into the case of
   justification, do turn the gospel into a law, properly so called; and
   do tell us, that the gospel justifieth as a law, and roundly own what
   is the necessary consequent of that doctrine, namely, that faith
   justifieth, as it is our evangelical righteousness, or our keeping the
   gospel law, which runs thus: He that believeth shall not perish.
   [Gibbon's Ser. Morn. Ex. Meth. p. 418-421.] But the holy Scripture
   teaches, that we are justified by grace, and by no law nor deed, [or
   work of a law, properly so called,] call it the law of Christ, or the
   gospel law, or what law one pleaseth; and thereby faith itself,
   considered as a deed or work of a law, is excluded from the
   justification of a sinner, and hath place therein, only as an
   instrument. (Gal 3:11), "That no man is justified by a law in the sight
   of God, it is evident."--(5:4), "Whosoever of you are justified by a
   law, ye are fallen from grace."--(Rom 3:28), "Therefore we conclude
   that a man is justified by faith, without deeds of a law." (Gal 2:16),
   "Knowing that a man is not justified by works of a law." I read, a law,
   deeds, works, simply; because so the original words, used in these
   texts, do undeniably signify. To this agrees Westm. Confess. chap. 11,
   art. 1, "These whom God effectually calleth, he also freely justifieth,
   not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's
   sake alone; not by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any
   other evangelical obedience, to them, as their righteousness; but," &c.
   Larg. Cat. quest. 73.--"Faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God,
   not as if the grace of faith, or any act thereof, were imputed to him
   for his justification; but only as it is an instrument by which he
   receiveth and applieth Christ and his righteousness." West. Confess.
   chap. 19, art. 6.--"Although true believers be not under the law, as a
   covenant of works, to be thereby justified or condemned, yet it is of
   great use to them, as well as to others, in that, as a rule of life,
   informing them of the will of God and their duty, it directs and binds
   them to walk accordingly." From this last passage of the confession,
   two important points plainly offer themselves. (1.) That the law is a
   rule of life to believers, directing and binding them to duty, though
   they are neither justified nor condemned by it. (2.) That neither
   justifying nor condemning belong unto the law, as a rule of life
   simply, but as a covenant of works. And these are the very points here
   taught by our author.

   [271] (Col 2:14), "Blotting out the hand-writing, nailing it to his
   cross."

   [272] That is, raise our esteem of it to the highest pitch, and give it
   illimitable obedience.

   [273] According to the holy Scripture, it is certain, that the law of
   the ten commandments has an irritating effect, whereby they increase
   sin; and a condemning and killing effect, so that they work curse,
   death, and wrath, called anger [it would seem] in the language of our
   forefathers, when Musculus' commonplaces were Englished. And it is no
   less certain, that Jesus Christ hath delivered believers from the law
   as it hath these effects, (Rom 14:15), "For if they which are of the
   law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect,
   because the law worketh wrath."--(7:5,6), "For when we were in the
   flesh, the motions of sins which were by the law, did work in our
   members, to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered from
   the law that we should serve in newness of spirit," &c.--(8:2), "For
   the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, has made me free from
   the law of sin and death."--(Gal 3:13), "Christ hath redeemed us from
   the curse of the law, being made a curse for us." If then the ten
   commandments have these effects, not only as they are the covenant of
   works, but as they are the law of Christ, or a rule of life, then
   believers are altogether delivered from them, which is absurd and
   abominable doctrine. Therefore it evidently follows, that the ten
   commandments have these effects, only as they are the covenant of
   works. The truth is, unto a gracious soul, the strongest possible
   temptation to Antinomianism, or casting off the ten commandments for
   good and all, would be to labour to persuade him, that they have these
   effects, not only as they are the covenant of works, but as they are
   the law of Christ; so that, take them what way he will, he shall find
   they have not only a cursing, condemning, and killing power, but also
   an irritating effect, increasing sin in him. Nevertheless, a Christian
   man's doing against them [which is the reverend Musculus' phrase, as
   cited by the author in the following,] may be a transgression, for a
   man may transgress the law, though the motions of his sins be not by
   the law. And how such a man's sinning is more outrageous than an
   ungodly man's will convincingly appear, if one measures the
   outrageousness of sinning, by the obligations to duty lying on the
   sinner, and not by his personal hazard, which is a measure more
   becoming a slave than a son.

   [274] Thus our author has proved, that the law of the ten commandments
   is a rule of life to believers; and hath vindicated Luther and Calvin
   from the opposite Antinomian error, as he does Musculus also, in the
   following words: and that from their express declarations, in their own
   words. And here is the conclusion of the whole matter. To show the
   judgment of other orthodox Protestant divines, on this head, against
   the Antinomians, it will not be amiss to adduce a passage out of a
   system of divinity, commonly put into the hands of students not very
   many years ago, I am sure. "It is one thing [says Turretine, disputing
   against the Antinomians] to be under the law as a covenant; another
   thing, to be under the law as a rule of life. In the former sense, Paul
   says, 'That we are not under the law, but under grace,' (Rom 6:14), as
   to its covenant relation, curse, and rigour; but in the latter sense we
   always remain bound unto it, though for a different end; for in the
   first covenant man was to do this, to the end that he might live; but
   in the other, he is bound to perform the same thing, not that he may
   live, but because he lives." Turret. loc. 11. quest. 24, thes. 7. View
   again, Westm. Confess. chap. 19, art. 6. Hereunto agreeth our author's
   conclusion, viz: That believers are no otherwise, not any otherwise
   delivered from the law of the ten commandments, but as they are the
   covenant of works. Now, how can those who oppose Antinomianism, on this
   head, contradict the author thereupon but by asserting, "That believers
   are not delivered from the law, as it is the covenant of works, but
   that they are still under the power of the covenant of works"? The
   which are principles as opposite to the received doctrine of orthodox
   Protestant divines and to the Confession of Faith, as they are to the
   doctrine of our author.

   [275] That is, that the particular precepts of the law of the ten
   commandments, called by Musculus the substance of the law-covenant, are
   disannulled, and no more to be regarded.

   [276] That is, very unsuitable.

   [277] That is, or if they be, as certainly they are, displeasing to
   Christ: most unsuitable, contrary, and repugnant to the righteousness
   which the believer hath received from Christ, then they are by no means
   to be done.

   [278] These are the words of Musculus still, adduced by the author to
   show, that that famous divine was no Antinomian; and if they will not
   serve to clear him, but he must still be on that side, I apprehend
   orthodox Protestants will be sorry for their loss of that great man.
   But though it be observed, that he speaks of doing against the things
   commanded in the law, but not against the law itself, there is no
   hazard: for it is evident, that by the law, Musculus understands the
   covenant of works, or, in his style, Moses' covenant; and since he was
   not of the opinion that believers are under the covenant of works, no,
   nor under the commanding power of that covenant, he could not say that
   they sinned against it. However, he still looks on the ten
   commandments, the substance of that covenant, to be also the law of
   Christ, binding the Christian man to obedience. From his saying, That a
   Christian doing against these things, sins more outrageously than one
   who is under the law; it does, indeed, follow, that a Christian's sin
   is more displeasing to God, and deserves a heavier curse in itself,
   though in the mean time, the law of Christ has no curse annexed unto
   the transgressions of it. For, sin's deserving of a curse, arises not
   from the threatening, but from its contrariety to the precept, and
   consequently, to the holy nature of God; since it is manifest that sin
   does not therefore deserve a curse, because a curse is threatened; but
   a curse is threatened, because sin deserves it. And the sins of
   believers do in themselves deserve a heavier curse than the sins of
   others. Yet the law of Christ has not a curse annexed to the
   transgressions of it; because the heavy curse, deserved by the sins of
   believers, was already laid on Christ, to whom they are united, and he
   bare it for them, and bore it away from them; so that they cannot be
   threatened with it over again, after their union with him.

   [279] We would have no need for the law written without us, if, as we
   are spiritual in part, in respect of sanctification begun in us, we
   were perfectly and altogether spiritual, both in body and soul. But
   that is not to be expected till the resurrection; when that which is
   now "sown a natural body, is raised a spiritual body," (1 Cor 15:44);
   being re-united to the spirit or soul "made perfect at death"; (Heb
   12:23); the which doth therefore no more, from the moment of death,
   need the law written without it.

   [280] That is, respecting believers.

   [281] Written.

   [282] They have not the law written completely and perfectly in their
   hearts.

   [283] This Antinomian principle, That it is needless for a man,
   perfectly justified by faith, to endeavour to keep the law, and do good
   works, is a glaring evidence that legality is so engrained in man's
   corrupt nature, that until a man truly come to Christ, by faith, the
   legal disposition will still be reigning in him; let him turn himself
   into what shape, or be of what principles he will in religion; though
   he run into Antinomianism he will carry along with him his legal
   spirit, which will always be a slavish and unholy spirit. He is
   constrained, as the author observes, to do all that he does for fear of
   punishment, and hope of reward; and if it is once fixed in his mind
   that these are ceased in his case, he stands still like a clock when
   the weights that made her go are removed, or like a slave when he is in
   no hazard of the whip; than which there cannot be a greater evidence of
   loathsome legality.

   [284] It is not the scope or design of Neophytus here, to show wherein
   the essence of faith consists, or to give a definition to it. But
   suppose it was so, his definition falls considerably short of some
   given by famous orthodox Protestant divines, yea, and churches too. See
   the note on the definition of faith. I repeat here Mr. John Davidson's
   definition only, viz: "Faith is an hearty assurance that our sins are
   freely forgiven us in Christ." From whence one may clearly see, that
   some time a-day, it was reckoned no absurdity that one's justification
   was made the object of one's belief. For the understanding of which
   ancient Protestant doctrine, grown almost quite out of ken with
   unlearned readers, I shall adduce a passage out of Wendeline's Christ.
   Theol. lib. 1. cap. 24, p. 542, 543. He proposes the Popish objection
   thus, "Justifying faith must go before justification; but the faith of
   special mercy doth not go before justification; if it did, it were
   false; for at that rate, a man should believe that his sins are
   forgiven, which as yet are not forgiven, since they are not forgiven
   but by justification; therefore the faith of special mercy is not
   justifying faith." In answer to which, he denies the second of these
   propositions, with the proofs thereof, and concludes in these words:
   "Justifying faith, therefore, hath for the special object of it,
   forgiveness of sins, future, present, and past." He explains it thus,
   "By the faith of special mercy, as it goeth before justification, a man
   doth not believe that his sins are forgiven him already, before the act
   of believing"; this, by the by, is the Antinomian faith, justifying
   only declaratively. Follows the true doctrine of faith: "But that he
   shall have forgiveness of sins; in the very act of justification, he
   believes his sins are forgiven him, and so receives forgiveness; after
   justification, he believes the past application," viz: forgiveness,
   that is, that his sins are now already forgiven him. But the design of
   Neophytus is, to make a profession of his faith, and, by an argument
   drawn from Christian experience, to refute the Antinomian pretended
   faith, whereby a sinner, at first brush, believes his sins to be
   already forgiven him, before the act of believing, and thereafter hath
   no regard to holiness of life; a plain evidence that that persuasion is
   not of God. And in opposition to it, is this profession made, which
   consists of three parts: (1.) He professes that he believes himself to
   be justified and acquitted from all his sins; and this is the belief of
   the past application, after justification, which we heard before from
   Wendeline. For we have already found Neophytus brought unto faith in
   Christ, and the match betwixt Christ and him declared to be made,
   though his faith was accompanied with fears. And now he finds his faith
   grown up in some small measure unto the height which Antinomista
   pretended his faith to be at, namely, unto believing himself to be
   already justified; but withal he intimates, that his faith had not come
   to this pitch all of a sudden, as Antinomista's had done; but that it
   was some time after he believed, ere he did thus believe. And now,
   indeed, his believing thus, only in some small measure, was his sin,
   and argued the weakness of his faith: but such a man's believing, in
   any measure, great or small, that he was justified and acquitted from
   all his sins, must be commended and approved, unless we will bring back
   the Popish doctrine of doubting. (2.) He professes, That therefore,
   namely, since he was justified, and believed himself to be so, he had
   no need to eschew evil, or do good for fear of punishment or hope of
   reward; the which Antinomista pretending to likewise, had cast off all
   care of keeping the law, or doing good works, having no other principle
   of obedience within him. This does not at all look to punishments and
   rewards, improperly so called, that is, fatherly chastisements and
   favours, of which the author afterwards treats expressly; but it is
   plainly meant of rewards and punishments taken in a proper sense, as
   flowing from the justice of God, remunerative and vindictive, and
   proceeding upon our works, good and evil; and particularly it is meant
   of heaven and hell. This is the sense in which that phrase is commonly
   used by divines; and that it is so to be taken here, is evident from
   its being inferred from his justification, which indeed leaves no place
   for fear of punishment and hope of reward in the latter sense: but not
   so in the former sense. And thus, it appears, Nomista understood it, as
   shall appear afterwards. (3.) He professes, That he was so far from
   being the less inclined to duty, that he believed himself to be fully
   justified, and that the fear of punishment and hope of reward were
   ceased in his case; that, on the contrary, he found, as his faith grew,
   his love to and readiness for holiness of life, grew: he was more
   willing, and more desirous to do the Lord's commandments than he had
   been before his faith was advanced to that pitch. And herein, I
   conceive, the experience of the saints will not contradict him. Thus he
   gives a plain testimony against the Antinomian faith.

   [285] Namely, the faith of special mercy, or a faith of particular
   application, without which, in greater or lesser measure, it is not
   saving faith.

   [286] His soul resting on Christ, whom he hath received for salvation.

   [287] Thus he conceives of God according to the measure of his faith,
   or of his soul's resting on Christ, which admits of various degrees.

   [288] A man's believing God's love to him, is woven into the very
   nature of saving faith, as hath been already shown. Wherefore,
   whatsoever humiliation, compunction, sorrow, and grief for sin, go
   before it, they must needs be but legal, being before faith, "without
   which it is impossible to please God," (Heb 11:6).

   [289] The belief of which, in some measure, is included in the nature
   of faith.--See note on the definition of faith.

   [290] This is the springing up of the "seeds of repentance put into the
   heart in sanctification," Larg. Cat. q. 75; a work of sanctifying
   grace, acceptable to God; the curse being taken off the sinner, and his
   person accepted in the Beloved, and like to the mourning and repenting
   of that woman, (Luke 7:47), "Who, having much forgiven her, loved
   much." Betwixt which repentance and pardon of sin, there is an
   inseparable connection, so that it is of such necessity to all sinners,
   that none may expect pardon without it. Westm. Confess. chap. 15. art.
   3.

   [291] This can have no reference at all to the motives of a believer's
   obedience, unless believers, as well as unbelievers, are to be reckoned
   to be under the covenant of works; for it is manifest, that the author
   speaks here of such only as are under that covenant. But, on the
   contrary, if a man is under the covenant of works called the law, in
   the style of the Holy Ghost, he is not a believer, but an unbeliever,
   (Rom 6:14), "Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under
   the law, but under grace." This reasoning proceeds upon this principle,
   viz: Those who are under the covenant of works, and they only, are
   under the dominion or reigning power of sin. And if men, being under
   the covenant of works, are under the dominion of sin, it is evident
   that they are not believers, but bond-servants, that the love of God
   dwelleth not in them, but corrupt self-love reigns in them; and,
   therefore, unto the good they do, they are constrained, by fear of
   punishment and hope of reward, agreeable to the threatening and promise
   of the broken covenant of works they are under; that their obedience,
   conform to their state and condition, is but servile; no better than it
   is here described to be, having only the letter, but not the spirit of
   true obedience, the which, before any man can attain unto, he must be
   set free from the covenant of works, as the apostle teaches; (Rom 7:6),
   "But now, we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we
   were held that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the
   oldness of the letter": and finally, that as is the condition and the
   obedience of those under the covenant of works, so shall their end be,
   (Gal 4:30), "Cast out the bond-woman and her son: for the son of the
   bond-woman shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman."

   [292] That is, till the empty vine be filled with the Spirit from Jesus
   Christ, it will never bring forth fruit unto him. Till a man do once
   eat by faith he will never work aright. The conscience must be purged
   from dead works, else one is not in case "to serve the living God,"
   (Heb 9:14). The covenant of works says to the sinner, who is yet
   without strength, "Work, and then ye shall be filled"; but the covenant
   of grace says to him, "Be filled, and then thou must work." And until
   the yoke of the covenant of works be taken off a man's jaws, and meat
   be laid unto him, he will never take on and bear the yoke of Christ's
   acceptably.

   [293] The words co-action and compulsion signify one and the same
   thing, viz: forcing; so that to work without the co-action or
   compulsion of the law, is to work without being force thereto by the
   law. One would think it so very plain and obvious, that the way how the
   law forceth men to work, is by the terror of the dreadful punishment
   which it threatens in case of not working, that it does but darken the
   matter to say, The co-action or compulsion of the law consists in its
   commanding and binding power or force; the which must needs be meant of
   the commanding and binding power of the covenant of works, or of the
   law, as it is the covenant of works. For it cannot be meant [as these
   words seem to bear] of that power which the law of the ten
   commandments, as a rule of life, hath over men, to bind them to
   obedience, under which, I think, the impartial reader is by this time
   convinced that the author denies not believers still to be; for to call
   that co-action or compulsion, is contrary to the common understanding
   and usage of these words in society. At this rate, one must say, That
   the glorified saints and angels [to ascend no higher] being, as
   creatures of God, under the commanding and binding power of the eternal
   rule of righteousness, are compelled and forced to their obedience too;
   and that when we pray, "Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven,"
   we pray to be enabled to obey the will of God, as the angels do in
   heaven, by co-action and compulsion in the height thereof; for surely
   the angels have the sense of the commanding and binding power of the
   eternal rule of righteousness upon them in a degree far beyond what any
   believer on earth has. Wherefore that exposition of the co-action or
   compulsion of the law, and so putting believers under the law's
   co-action or compulsion, amount just to what we met with before,
   namely, That believers are under the commanding power [at least] of the
   covenant of works, having obedience bound upon them with the cords of
   hell, or under the pain of the curse. Accordingly, the compulsion of
   the law is more plainly described to be its binding power and moral
   force, which it derives from the awful authority of the sovereign
   Lawgiver, commanding obedience to his law, and threatening disobedience
   with wrath, or with death, or hell. And so our author is blamed for not
   subjecting believers to this compulsion of the law. In the preceding
   paragraph he had shown, that the obedience of unbelievers to the law of
   the ten commandments is produced by the influence of the law [or
   covenant] of works upon them, forcing or constraining them thereto by
   the fear of the punishment which it threatens. Thus, they work by the
   co-action or compulsion of the law, or covenant of works, being
   destitute of the love of God. Here he affirms, that when once a man is
   brought unto Christ, he having the sanctifying Spirit of Christ
   dwelling in him, and being endowed with faith that purifies the heart,
   and with love that is strong as death, is enabled to work freely, and
   of his own accord, without that co- action or compulsion. This is the
   doctrine of the holy Scripture. (Psa 51:12), "Uphold me with thy free
   spirit." Compare (Gal 5:18), "But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are
   not under the law." So (Psa 110:3), "Thy people shall be willing in the
   day of thy power." Compare (1 Peter 5:2), "Not by constraint but
   willingly." And believers are declared to be "not under the law," (Rom
   6:14).--"To be made free from the law of death. Not to have received
   the spirit of bondage again to fear, but the spirit of adoption,"
   (8:2,15). How then can they still be under the co-active and compulsive
   power of the law, frightening and forcing them to obedience by its
   threatenings of the second death, or eternal wrath? And it is evident
   that this is the received doctrine of orthodox divines, which might be
   attested by a cloud of witnesses, if the nature of this work did
   permit. "Not to be under the law," says Luther, "is to do good things,
   and abstain from wicked things, not through compulsion of the law, but
   by free love, and with pleasure." Chos. Ser. 20, p. 232. "The second
   part [viz: of Christian liberty] is," says Calvin, "that consciences
   obey the law, not as compelled by the necessity of the law, but being
   free from the yoke of the law itself, of their own accord they obey the
   will of God." Instit. book 3, chap. 19, sec. 4. "We would distinguish
   betwixt the law, considered as a law and as a covenant. A law doth
   necessarily imply no more than, (1.) To direct. (2.) To command,
   enforcing that obedience by authority. A covenant doth further
   necessarily imply promises made upon some condition, or threatenings
   added, if such a condition be not performed. The first two are
   essential to the law, the last two to believers, are made void through
   Christ; in which sense it is said, that by him we are freed from the
   law as a covenant; so that believers' lives depend not on the promises
   annexed to the law, nor are they in danger by the threatenings adjoined
   to it." Durham on the Commands, p. 4. "What a new creature doth, in
   observance of the law, is from natural freedom, choice, and judgment,
   and not by the force of any threatenings annexed to it." Charnock, vol.
   2, p. 59. See Westminster Confession, chap. 20, art. 1, of which
   afterwards. And thus is that text, (1 Tim 1:9), "The law is not made
   for a righteous man, generally understood by divines, critics, and
   commentators, the law, threatening, compelling, condemning, is not made
   for a righteous man, because he is pushed forward to duty of his own
   accord, and is no more led by the spirit of bondage, and fear of
   punishment." Turret. loc. 2, q. 24, th. 8.--"By the law is to be
   understood the moral law, as it is armed in stings and terrors, to
   restrain rebellious sinners. By the righteous man is meant one in whom
   a principle of divine grace is planted, and who, from the knowledge and
   love of God, chooses the things that are pleasing to him. As the law
   has annexed so many severe threatenings to the transgressors of it, it
   is evident that it is directed to the wicked, who will only be
   compelled by fear from an outrageous breaking of it." Continuation of
   Poole's Annotations on the Text. "The law is not for him, as a master
   to command him, to constrain him as a bondman." Lodovic de Dieu. "The
   law doth not compel, press on, fright, lie heavy upon, and punish a
   righteous man." Strigelius.--"It lies not on him as a heavy burden,
   compelling a man against his will, violently pressing him on, and
   pushing him forwards; it doth not draw him to obedience; but leads him,
   being willing." Scultetus.--"For of his own accord he doth right."
   Castalio, apud Pol. Synop. in Loc.

   [294] "It is a metonymy from the effect, that is, love makes me to do
   it in that manner, as a man that is compelled; that is the meaning of
   it. So it has the same effect that compulsion hath, though there be
   nothing more different from compulsion than love." Dr. Preston, ibid.
   p. 29.

   [295] If one considers that the drift and scope of this whole
   discourse, is to discover the naughtiness of Antinomista's faith,
   observed by Neophytus, one may perceive, that by the author's quoting
   Towne, the Antinomian, upon that head, he gives no more ground to
   suspect himself of Antinomianism, though he calls him an evangelical
   man than a Protestant gives in point of Popery, by quoting Cardinal
   Bellarmine against a Papist, though withal he call him a Catholic. And
   the epithet given to Towne, is so far from being a high commendation,
   that, really, it is none at all; for, though both these epithets, the
   latter as well as the former, are in themselves honourable, yet in
   these cases, a man speaking in the language of his adversary, they are
   nothing so. Evangelista could not but remember that Antinomista had
   told him roundly, "That he had not been so evangelical as some others
   in the city, which caused him to leave hearing of him, to hear them,"
   viz: those evangelical men; and why might not he give him a sound note
   from one of those evangelical men, even under that character, so
   acceptable to him, without ranking himself with them?

   [296] As for what concerns the hope of heaven, the author purposely
   explains that matter, that he would not have any believer to eschew
   evil or do good for fear of hell; the meaning thereof plainly is this,
   you being a believer in Christ, ought not to eschew evil and do good,
   for fear you be condemned, and cast into hell. So far as a believer
   doth so, the author justly reckons his obedience accordingly slavish.
   This is the common understanding and sense of such a phrase, as when we
   say, The slave works for fear of the whip. Some men abstain from
   stealing, robbing, and the like, for fear of the gallows; they eschew
   evil, not from love of virtue, but for fear of punishment, as the
   heathen poet says of his pretender to virtue, Oderunt peccare boni
   virtutis amore, Tu nihil admittes in te formidine poenae. Horat. Epist.
   16. Which may be thus Englished: Hatred of vice, in generous souls,
   From love of virtue flows, While nothing vicious minds controls But
   servile fear of blows. This is quite another thing than to say, that a
   believer in doing good, or eschewing evil, ought not to regard
   threatenings, nor be influenced by the threatening of death. For though
   believers ought never to fear that they shall be condemned and cast
   into hell, yet they both may and ought awfully to regard the
   threatenings of the holy law: and how they ought to regard them, one
   may learn from the Westm. Confess. chap. 19, art. 6, in these words,
   "The threatenings of it [viz: the law] serve to show what even their
   sins deserve; and what afflictions in this life they may expect for
   them, although freed from the curse thereof threatened in the law."
   Thus they are to regard them, not as denunciations of their doom, in
   case of sinning, but as a looking-glass wherein to behold the fearful
   demerit of their sin; the unspeakable love of God in freeing them from
   bearing it, his fatherly displeasure against his own for their sin, and
   the tokens of his anger to be expected by them in that case. So will
   they be influenced to eschew evil and do good, being thereby filled
   with hatred and horror of sin, thankfulness to God, and fear of the
   displeasure and frowns of their Father, though not with a fear that he
   will condemn them, and destroy them in hell; this glass represents no
   such thing. Such a fear in a believer is groundless. For (1.) He is not
   under the threatening of hell, or liable to the curse. If he were, he
   behoved that moment he sinneth to fall under the curse. For since the
   curse is the sentence of the law, passing on the sinner, according to
   the threatening, adjudging, and binding him over to the punishment
   threatened; if the law say to a man, before he sinneth, "In the day
   thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die," it says unto him, in the
   moment he sinneth, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all
   things written in the law, to do them." And forasmuch as believers sin
   in every thing they do, their very believing and repenting being always
   attended with sinful imperfections, it is not possible, at this rate,
   that they can be one moment from under the curse; but it must be
   continually wreathed about their necks. To distinguish in this case,
   betwixt gross sins and lesser sins, is vain; for as every sin, even the
   least, deserves God's wrath and curse, [Short. Cat.,] so, against
   whomsoever the curse takes place, [and by virtue of God's truth, it
   takes place against all those who are threatened with hell or eternal
   death] they are cursed for all sins, smaller or greater: "Cursed is
   every one that continueth not in all things": though still there is a
   difference made betwixt greater and lesser sins, in respect of the
   degree of punishment, yet there is none in respect of the kind. But now
   believers are set free from the curse. (Gal 3:13), "Christ hath
   redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us." (2.)
   By the redemption of Christ already applied to the believer, and by the
   oath of God, he is perfectly secured from the return of the curse upon
   him, (Gal 3:13), [see before,] compared with (Isa 53, 54:9), "For this
   is as the waters of Noah unto me: for, as I have sworn that the waters
   of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would
   not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee." Therefore he is perfectly
   secured from being made liable any more to hell or eternal death. For a
   man, being under the curse, is "so made liable to the pains of hell for
   ever." Short. Cat. (3.) He is justified by faith, and so adjudged to
   live eternally in heaven. This is unalterable, "for the gifts and
   calling of God are without repentance," (Rom 11:29). And a man can
   never stand adjudged to eternal life, and to eternal death, at one and
   the same time. (4.) One great difference betwixt believers and
   unbelievers lies here, that the latter are bound over to hell and
   wrath, the former are not: (John 3:18), "He that believeth is not
   condemned: but he that believeth not, is condemned already"; not that
   he is in hell already, but bound over to it. Now, a believer is still a
   believer, from the first moment of his believing; and therefore it
   remains true concerning him, from that moment for ever, that he is not
   condemned or bound over to hell and wrath. He is expressly secured
   against it for all time to come, from that moment. (John 5:24), "He
   shall not come into condemnation." And the apostle cuts off all evasion
   by distinctions of condemnation here, while he tells us in express
   terms, "There is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,"
   (Rom 8:1). (5.) The believer's union with Christ is never dissolved.
   (Hosea 2:19), "I will betroth thee unto me for ever": and being in
   Christ he is set beyond the reach of condemnation, (Rom 8:1). Yea, and
   being in Christ, he is perfectly righteous for ever; for he is never
   again stripped of the white raiment of Christ's imputed righteousness;
   while the union remains, it cannot be lost: but to be perfectly
   righteous, and yet liable to condemnation before a just Judge, are
   inconsistent. Neither is such a fear in a believer acceptable to God;
   for, (1.) It is not from the Spirit of God, but from one's own spirit,
   or a worse; (Rom 8:15), "Ye have not received the spirit of bondage
   again to fear"; namely, to fear death or hell. (Heb 2:15), "Who through
   fear of death were all their life-time subject to bondage." (2.) It was
   the design of the sending of Christ, that believers in him might serve
   God without that fear, (Luke 1:74). That "We, being delivered out of
   the hands of our enemies, might serve him without fear." Compare (1 Cor
   15:26), "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." And for this
   very cause Jesus Christ came, "That through death he might destroy him
   that had the power of death, that is the devil; and deliver them, who,
   through fear of death, were all their life-time," namely, before their
   deliverance by Christ, "subject to bondage," (Heb 2:14,15). (3.) Though
   it is indeed consistent with, yet it is contrary to faith; (Matt 8:26),
   "Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith!" And to love too; (1 John
   4:18), "Perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment."--(2
   Tim 1:7), "God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, of
   love, and of a sound mind." (4.) As it is not agreeable to the
   character of a father, who is not a revenging judge to his own family,
   to threaten to kill his children, though he threaten to chastise them:
   so such a fear is no more agreeable to the spirit of adoption, nor
   becoming the state of sonship to God, than for a child to fear that his
   father, being such a one, will kill him. And therefore, "the spirit of
   bondage to fear" is opposed to "the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
   Abba, Father," (Rom 8:15). "Adoption is an act of the free grace of
   God, whereby all those that are justified are received into the number
   of his children, have his name put upon them, the Spirit of his Son
   given to them, [receive the spirit of adoption, Westm. Confess. chap.
   12,] are under his fatherly care and dispensation, admitted to all the
   liberties and privileges of the sons of God, made heirs of all the
   promises, and fellow-heirs with Christ in glory." Larg. Cat. q. 74.
   "The LIBERTY which Christ has purchased for believers under the gospel,
   consists in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath
   of God, the curse of the moral law, as also in their free access to
   God, and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of slavish fear,
   but a child-like love and willing mind. All which were common also to
   believers under the law." Westm. Confess. chap. 20, art. 1. By the
   guilt of sin here, must needs be understood obligation to eternal
   wrath. "The end of Christian liberty is, that being delivered out of
   the hands of our enemies, we might 'serve the Lord without fear.'"
   Ibid. art. 3. "The one [viz: justification] doth equally free all
   believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in this
   life, that they never fall into condemnation." Larg. Cat. q. 77.
   "Though a soul be justified and freed from the guilt of eternal
   punishment, and so the spirit is no more to be afraid and disquieted
   for eternal wrath and hell." Rutherford's Trial and Triumph, &c. Ser.
   19, p. 261. "The believer hath no conscience of sins; that is, he in
   conscience is not to fear everlasting condemnation, that is most true."
   Ibid. p. 266.

   [297] And no marvel one would have them do so, since that is what all
   the children of God with one mouth do daily pray for, saying "Thy will
   be done on earth as it is in heaven."

   [298] There is a great difference betwixt a believer's eschewing evil
   for fear of hell, and his eschewing it from the fear of God, "as able
   to destroy both soul and body in hell." The former respects the event
   as to his eternal state, the latter not. To this purpose the variation
   of the phrase in the text is observable,--"fear not them that KILL the
   body": this notes the event, as to temporal death by the hands of men,
   which our Lord would have his people to lay their account with; but
   with respect to eternal death, he says not, fear him which destroys,
   but, "which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." Moreover,
   the former is a slavish fear of God as a revenging judge; the believer
   eschewing sin for fear he be damned: the latter is a reverential fear
   of God as of a Father with whom is awful dominion and power. The former
   carries in it a doubtfulness and uncertainty as to the event, plainly
   contrary to the remedy prescribed in this same case: (Prov 29:25), "The
   fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord
   shall be safe." The latter is consistent with the most full assurance
   of one's being put beyond all hazard of hell, (Heb 12:28,29),
   "Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have
   grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and godly
   fear. For our God is a consuming fire." A believer, by fixing his eyes
   on God, as able to destroy both soul and body in hell, may be so filled
   with the reverential fear of God, his dreadful power and wrath against
   sin, as to be fenced against the slavish fear of the most cruel
   tyrants, tempting him to sin; though in the mean time he most firmly
   believes that he is past that gulf, can never fall into it, nor be
   bound over unto it. For, so he hath a lively representation of the just
   deserving of sin, even of that sin in particular unto which he is
   tempted; and so must tremble at the thought of it, as an evil greater
   than death. And as a child, when he seeth his father lashing his
   slaves, cannot but tremble, and fear to offend him, so a believer's
   turning his eyes on the miseries of the damned, must raise in him an
   awful apprehension of the severity of his Father against sin, even in
   his own; and cause him to say in his heart, "My flesh trembleth for
   fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments," (Psa 119:120). Thus
   also he hath a view of the frightful danger, he has escaped; the
   looking back to which must make one's heart shiver, and conceive a
   horror of sin; as in the case of a pardoned criminal, looking back to a
   dreadful precipice from which he was to have been thrown headlong, had
   not a pardon seasonably prevented his ruin; (Eph 2:3), "We were by
   nature the children of wrath, even as others."

   [299] Thus, to eschew evil and do good for hope of heaven, is to do so
   in hope of obtaining heaven by our own works. And certainly "that hope
   shall be cut off, and be a spider's web," (Job 8:14); for a sinner
   shall never obtain heaven but in the way of free grace: "But if it be
   of works, then it is no more grace," (Rom 11:6). But that a believer
   may be animated to obedience by eying the reward already obtained for
   him by the works of Christ, our author no where denies. So indeed the
   apostle exhorts believers to run their Christian race, "looking unto
   Jesus, who, for the joy that was set before him," [to be obtained by
   his own works, in the way of most proper merits] "endured the cross,"
   (Heb 12:1,2). "Papists," says Dr. Preston, "tell of escaping damnation,
   and of getting into heaven. But Scripture gives other motives [viz: to
   good works]: Thou art in Christ, and Christ is thine; consider what he
   hath done for thee, what thou hast by him, what thou hadst been without
   him, and thus stir up thyself to do for him what he
   requireth."--Abridg. of his Works, p. 394.

   [300] "Man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him for ever."
   Short. Cat.--"Believers shall be made perfectly blessed in full
   enjoying of God to all eternity." Ibid.

   [301] (Rom 4:16), "Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace;
   to the end the promise [viz: of the inheritance (verse 13,14),] might
   be sure to all the seed." Otherwise it is not given freely; for "to him
   that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt," (verse
   4).

   [302] The apostle's decision in this case seems to be pretty clear:
   (Rom 6:23), "for the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is
   eternal life": he will not have us to look upon it as the wages of a
   servant too. The joining together of both these notions of the reward
   was, it seems, the doctrine of the Pharisees; (Mark 10:17), "Good
   Master, what shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?" And how
   unacceptable it was to our blessed Saviour, may be learned from his
   answer to that question. "The Papists confess that life is merited by
   Christ, and is made ours by the right of inheritance: so far we go with
   them. Yea, touching works, they hold many things with us; (1.) That no
   works of themselves can merit life everlasting. (2.) That works done
   before conversion, can merit nothing at God's hand. (3.) That there is
   no merit at God's hand, without his mercy, no exact merit as often
   there is amongst men. The point whereabout we dissent is, that with the
   merit of Christ and free promise, they will have the merit of works
   joined, as done by them who are adopted children."--Bayne on Ephesians
   2:8).

   [303] Namely, in the way of the covenant of grace.

   [304] Our author, remembering Nomista's bias towards good works, as
   separated from Christ, puts him in mind, that Christ is the way; and
   that the soul's motion heaven-ward is in Christ; that is, a man being
   once united to Christ by faith, moveth heaven-ward, making progress in
   believing, and by influences derived from Jesus Christ, walking in his
   holy commandments. The Scripture acknowledges no other holiness of
   life, or good works; and concerning the necessity of these the author
   moves no debate. But as to the propriety of expression, since good
   works are the keeping of the commandments, in the way of which we are
   to go, he conceives they may, with greater propriety, be called the
   walking in the way, than the way itself. It is certain that the
   Scripture speaks of "walking in Christ," (Col 2:6), "walking in his
   commandments," (2 Chron 17:4), and "walking in good works," (Eph 2:10);
   and that as these terms signify but one and the same thing, so they are
   all metaphorical. But one would think the calling of good works the way
   to be walked in, is further removed from the propriety of expression,
   than the calling them the walking in the way. But the author waiving
   this, as a matter of phraseology, or manner of speaking only, tells us,
   that assuredly the sum and substance, both of the way to eternal
   happiness, and of the walking in the way to it, consists in the
   receiving Jesus Christ by faith, and in yielding obedience to his law,
   according to the measure of that receiving. Herein is comprehended
   Christ and holiness, faith and obedience; which are inseparable. And no
   narrower is the compass of the way and walking mentioned, (Isa 35:8,9),
   "It shall be called the way of holiness--the redeemed shall walk
   there."--"The way of holiness, or the holy way, [according to an usual
   Hebraism,] as it is generally understood by interpreters, is the way
   leading to heaven, says Piscator; namely, Christ, faith, and the
   doctrine of a holy life." Fererius apud Pol. Synop. in loc. And now
   that our author, though he conceives good works are not so properly
   called the way, as the walking, yet does not say, that in no sense they
   may be called the way, but does expressly assert them to be the soul's
   walking in the way of eternal happiness; he cannot justly be charged
   here [more than any where else in his book] with teaching, that
   holiness is not necessary to salvation, unless one will, in the first
   place, say that though the way itself to eternal happiness is necessary
   to salvation, yet the walking in the way is not necessary to it; which
   would be Antinomian with a witness.

   [305] And not for any thing wrought in himself, or done by himself.

   [306] The sum thereof is, that no considerations, no endeavours
   whatsoever, will truly sanctify a man, without faith. Howbeit, such
   considerations and endeavours are necessary to promote and advance the
   sanctification of the soul by faith.

   [307] That is, transforms or changes. (Rom 12:2), "Be ye transformed by
   the renewing of your mind."

   [308] Namely, instrumentally. It cannot be denied that our author
   places faith before the new principles of actions in this passage, and
   before the habits of grace, and yet it will not follow, that, in his
   opinion, there can be no gracious change in the soul before faith. What
   he does indeed teach, in this matter, is warranted by the plain
   testimony of the apostle, (Eph 1:13), "After that ye believed, ye were
   sealed with that holy Spirit of promise." And what this seal is, at
   least as to the chief part of it, may be learned from John 1:16, "And
   of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace." For as
   sealing is the impression of the image of the seal on the wax, so that
   it thereby receives upon it point for point on the seal, so believers
   being sealed with the Spirit of Christ, receive grace for grace in
   Christ, whereby they are made like him, and bear his image. And as it
   is warranted by the words, so it is agreeable to the old Protestant
   doctrine, that we are regenerate by faith; which is the title of the 3d
   chap. of the 3d book of Calvin's Instit. and is taught in the Old
   Confess. art. 3, in these words: "Regeneration is wrought by the power
   of the Holy Ghost, working in the hearts of the elect of God an assured
   faith"; and art. 13, in these words: "So soon as the Spirit of the Lord
   Jesus [which God's elect children receive by true faith] takes
   possession in the heart of any man, so soon does he regenerate and
   renew the same man." Nevertheless, I am not of the mind, that, either
   in truth, or in the judgment of our reformers, or of our author, the
   first act of faith is an act of an unregenerate, that is to say, a dead
   soul. But to understand this matter aright, I conceive one must
   distinguish betwixt regeneration taken strictly, and taken largely; and
   betwixt new powers and new habits or principles of action.
   Regeneration, strictly so called, is the quickening of the dead soul,
   by the Spirit of Christ passively received, and goes before faith,
   according to John 1:12,13, "But as many as received him, to them gave
   he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
   name; which were born not of blood, but of God." This is called by
   Amesius, the first regeneration, Medul. lib. 1, cap. 29, sect. 6; see
   cap. 26, sect. 19. And it belongs to, or is the same with effectual
   calling; in the description of which, in the Shorter Catechism, one
   finds a renewing mentioned, whereby sinners are enabled to embrace
   Jesus Christ; and, says the Larger Catechism on the same subject,
   "They, although in themselves dead in sin, are hereby made able to
   answer his call." Regeneration, largely taken, presupposing the former,
   is the same with sanctification, wrought in the soul by the Spirit of
   Christ, actively received by faith, and so follows faith. (Acts 26:18),
   "Among them which are sanctified by faith, that is in Me": the subjects
   of which "are the redeemed, called, and justified." Essen. Com. cap.
   16, sect. 3. And accordingly, in the description thereof in the Shorter
   Catechism, mention is made of a second renewing, namely, "Whereby we
   are renewed in the whole man after the image of God, and are enabled
   more and more to die unto sin, and live unto righteousness." And thus I
   conceive regeneration to be taken in the above passages of the Old
   Confession. The which is confirmed by the following testimonies: "Being
   in Christ, we must be new creatures, not in substance, but in qualities
   and disposition of our minds, and change of the actions of our lives,
   all which is impossible to them that have no faith." Mr. John
   Davidson's Catechism, page 29.--"So good works follow as effects of
   Christ in us, possessed by faith, who beginneth to work in us
   regeneration and a renewing of the whole parts and powers of the soul
   and body. Which begun sanctification and holiness he never ceases to
   accomplish." Ibid. p. 30.--"The effect [viz: of justification] inherent
   in us, as in a subject, is that new quality which is called inherent
   righteousness or regeneration." Grounds of Christian Religion, by the
   renowned Beza and Faius, 1586, chap. 29, sect. 11.--"That new quality,
   then called inherent righteousness and regeneration, testified by good
   works, is a necessary effect of true faith." Ibid. chap. 31, sect. 13.
   Now in regeneration taken in the former sense, new powers are put into
   the soul, whereby the sinner, who was dead in sin, is able to discern
   Christ in his glory, and to embrace him by faith. But it is in
   regeneration taken in the latter sense, that new habits of grace, or
   immediate principles of actions are given; namely, upon the soul's
   uniting with Christ by faith. So Essenius, having defined regeneration
   to be, the putting of spiritual life in a man spiritually dead,
   [compare chap. 14, sect. 11,] afterwards says, "As by regeneration new
   powers were put into the man, so by sanctification are given new
   spiritual habits." Theological Virtues, ibid. cap. 16, sect. 5. And as
   the Scriptures are express, in that men are "sanctified by faith,"
   (Acts 26:18), so is the Larger Catechism in that it is in
   sanctification they are "renewed in the whole man, having the seeds of
   repentance unto life, and of all other saving graces, put into their
   hearts," quest. 75.

   [309] This man, Bernardine Ochine, an infamous apostate, was at first a
   monk; but as our author says, being much enlightened in the knowledge
   of the gospel, he not only made profession of the Protestant Religion,
   but, together with the renowned Peter Martyr, was esteemed a most
   famous preacher of the gospel, throughout Italy. Being in danger on the
   account of religion, he left Italy by Martyr's advice; and being much
   assisted by the Duchess of Ferrara in his escape, he went first to
   Geneva, and then to Zurich, and was admitted a minister in that city.
   But discovering himself there, [as Simon Magus did, after he had joined
   himself to the church of Samaria] he was banished; and is justly
   reckoned among the forerunners of the execrable Socinus. See Hoornbeck,
   appar. ad. contr. Soc. page 47. Hence one may plainly see how there are
   sermons of his which might safely and to good purpose be quoted. And as
   for the character given him by the author here, if one is in hazard of
   reckoning it an applause, one must remember that is no greater than
   what the apostle gives to the guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost,
   (Heb 6:6), "Those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the
   heavenly gift," &c., which I make no question but our author had his
   eye upon, in giving this man this character very pertinently.

   [310] That is, by believing, get a saving interest in Christ; whereas,
   before, you have set yourself, as it were, to work it. See the note on
   the Definition of Faith.

   [311] "Which [adds he] if it proceed not from faith, is not so much as
   a sound proof of faith, much less can it be any cause to draw them to
   believe."--"The only firm ground of saving faith is God's truth,
   revealed in his word; as is plainly taught," (Rom 10:17). Ibid p. 20,
   21.

   [312] This censure, as it natively follows upon the overthrowing of
   that doctrine, viz: "That holiness of life must go before faith, and so
   be the ground of it, and produce and bring it forth"; so it is founded
   on these two ancient Protestant principles: (1.) That the belief of the
   remission of sin is comprehended in saving, justifying faith. (2.) That
   true repentance, and acceptable reformation of life, do necessarily
   flow from, but go not before saving faith. Hence it necessarily
   follows, that remission of sin must be believed, before there can be
   any acceptable reformation of life; and that the preacher's fear was
   groundless, reformation of life being so caused by the faith of
   remission of sin, that it is inseparable from it: as our author teaches
   in the following passages. Calvin's censure in this case is fully as
   severe: "As for them [says he] that think that repentance does rather
   go before faith, than flow or spring forth of it, as a fruit out of a
   tree, they never knew the force thereof." Instit. book 3. chap. 3.
   sect. 1.--"Yet when we refer the beginning of repentance to faith, we
   do not dream a certain mean space of time, wherein it brings it out:
   but we mean to show, that a man cannot earnestly apply himself to
   repentance, unless he know himself to be of God." Ibid. sect. 2.

   [313] Namely, faith.

   [314] Even so, faith not only justifies a sinner, but sanctifies him in
   heart and life.

   [315] I think this expression might very well have been spared here.

   [316] "Q. Does not this doctrine [viz: of justification by faith
   without works] make men secure and profane? A. No, for it cannot be,
   but they who are ingrafted into Christ by faith, should bring forth
   fruits of thankfulness." Palat. Cat. q. 64.

   [317] As a woman married to a second husband, after the death of the
   first, does the same work for subsistence in the family, that was
   required of her by the first husband; yet does it not to, nor as under
   the dead husband, but the living one; so the good works of believers
   are materially, and but materially, the works of the law, as a
   covenant, the first husband, now dead to the believer. In this sense
   only the law is here treated of: and to make the good works of
   believers formally the works of the law as a covenant and husband, is
   to contradict the apostle, (Rom 7:4-6), to "make them deadly fruits,
   dishonourable to Christ, the second husband, and unacceptable to God."

   [318] After that manner.

   [319] The Antinomian sense of all these positions is, no doubt,
   erroneous and detestable, and is opposed and disproved by our author.
   The positions themselves are paradoxes bearing a precious gospel truth,
   which he maintains against the legalist; but I doubt it is too much to
   call them all Antinomian paradoxes. But to call them simply, and by the
   lump, Antinomian errors, is shocking: one might as good say, it is a
   Popish or Lutheran error, "that the bread in the sacrament is Christ's
   body"; and that it is a Socinian, Arminian, or Baxterian error, "That a
   sinner is justified by faith"; for the first four of the paradoxes are
   as directly scriptural as these are; though the Antinomian sense of the
   former is anti-scriptural, as is the Popish, Lutheran, Socinian,
   Arminian, and Baxterian sense of the latter, respectively. At this
   rate, one might subvert the very foundations of Christianity, as might
   easily be instructed, if there were sufficient cause to exemplify it
   here. How few doctrines of the Bible are there that have not been
   wrested to an erroneous sense by some corrupt men or other! yet will
   not their corrupt glosses warrant the condemning of the scriptural
   positions themselves as erroneous. The first four of these paradoxes
   are found in the following texts of Scripture, viz: 1st. (Rom 6:14),
   "Ye are not under the law, but under grace."--(7:6), "Now we are
   delivered from the law." 2d. (1 John 3:6), "Whosoever abideth in him
   sinneth not."--(verse 9), "Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit
   sin, and he cannot sin." 3d. (Num 23:21), "He hath not beheld iniquity
   in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel."--(Cant 4:7),
   "Thou art all fair, my love, there is no spot in thee." 4th. (Isa
   54:9), "So have I sworn, that I would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke
   thee." The case standing thus, these paradoxes must needs be sensed one
   way or other, agreeable to the analogy of faith, and so defended by all
   who own the divine authority of the holy Scripture. And as an orthodox
   divine would not condemn the two propositions above mentioned, brought
   in for illustration of this matter, but clear the same by giving a
   sound sense of them, and rejecting the unsound sense, as that it is
   true that the bread is Christ's body sacramentally; false, that it is
   so by transubstantiation, or consubstantiation: that it is true,
   sinners, are justified by faith as an instrument, apprehending and
   applying Christ's righteousness; false, that they are justified by it
   as a work, fulfilling the pretended new proper gospel law: so our
   author gives a safe and sound sense of these scriptural paradoxes, and
   rejects the unsound sense put upon them by Antinomians; and this he
   does, by applying to them the distinction of the law, as it is the law
   of works, i.e., the covenant of works, and as it is the law of Christ,
   i.e., a rule of life, in the hand of a Mediator, to believers. Now, if
   this distinction be not admitted here, neither in these nor equivalent
   terms, but the law of Christ, and law of works, must be reckoned one
   and the same thing; then believers in Christ, whom none but Antinomians
   will deny to be under the law, as it is the law of Christ, or a rule of
   life, are evidently staked down under the covenant works still;
   forasmuch as, in the sense of the holy Scripture, as well as in the
   sense of our author, the law of works is the covenant of works. And
   since it is plain from the holy Scripture, and from the Westminster
   Confession, that believers are not under the law as a covenant of
   works; a way which, by this distinction, our author had blocked up, is,
   by rejecting of it, and confounding the law of works and law of Christ,
   opened for Antinomians to cast off the law for good and all. The two
   last of these paradoxes are consequently scriptural, as necessarily
   following upon the former, being understood in the same sense as they
   are, and as our author explains them.

   [320] "True believers be not under the law as a covenant of works."
   Westm. Confess. chap. 19, sect. 6.--"The law of works," says our
   author, "is as much as to say, the covenant of works."

   [321] "As the world is altogether set upon sin, and can do nothing but
   sin, so they that are born of God sin not; not that their sins of
   themselves are not deadly, but because their persons are so lively in
   Christ, that the deadliness of sin cannot prevail against them." Mr.
   John Davidson's Cat. p. 32. What he means by the deadliness of sin,
   appears from these words a little after: "Howbeit the condemnation of
   sin be removed from the faithful altogether," &c. The penalty which the
   law of works threatens, says our author to Neophytus, is "condemnation
   and eternal death; and this you have no cause at all to fear."

   [322] Mr. James Melvil to the same purpose expresses it thus:-- But God
   into his daughter dear sees nane iniquitie, Nor in his chosen Israel
   will spy enormitie: Not looking in hir bowk, whilk is with frentickles
   replete But ever into Christ her face, whilk pleasand is and sweet.
   Morning Vision, dedicated to James VI. p. 85.

   [323] Such anger is revenging wrath, and such chastisement is proper
   punishment inflicted for satisfying offended justice; in which sense it
   is said, (Isa 53:5), "The chastisement of our peace was upon him,"
   namely, on Jesus Christ; and therefore it cannot be on believers
   themselves.

   [324] Our author does not indeed here refute the Antinomian error, that
   the believer ought not to mourn for his sins; he does that effectually
   in the next paragraph. But here he refutes the legalist, who will needs
   have the believer still to be under the law, as it is the covenant of
   works; and therefore to confess and mourn, &c. for his sins, as still
   committed against the covenant of works. But it is evident as the
   light, that believers are not under the covenant of works, or, in other
   terms, under the law, as that covenant; and that principle being once
   fixed, the whole chain of consequences, which our author has here made,
   does necessarily follow thereupon. It is strange that nothing can be
   allowed in believers to be mourning for sin, unless they mourn for it
   as unbelievers, as persons under the covenant of works, who doubtless
   are under the curse and condemnation for their sin, (Gal 3:10). But "as
   our obedience now is not the performance, so our sinning is not the
   violation of the condition of the old covenant. Believers' sins now,
   though transgressions of the law, are not counted violations of the
   conditions of the covenant of works, under which they are not." Brown
   on Justification, chap. 15. p. 224.--"If sense of sin be taken for the
   unbelieving feeling of, and judging myself cast out of his sight, and
   condemned; whereas yet I am in Christ, and 'it is God that justifies
   me; who is he that shall condemn?' (Rom 8:33,34); we shall agree with
   Antinomians. This is indeed the hasty sense of unbelief. (Psa 31:22,
   John 2:4). Hence let them be rebuked, who say not that Christ in his
   gospel hath taken away this sense of sin." Rutherford on the Covenant,
   p. 222.

   [325] Thus our author hath solidly refuted in this paragraph the
   Antinomian sense of all the six positions above mentioned.

   [326] Namely, now to improve these points of doctrine in my practice.
   There lies the great difficulty: and according as unbelief or faith has
   the ascendant, so will the soul in practice carry itself; confessing,
   begging pardon, fasting, mourning, and humbling itself either as a
   condemned malefactor, or as an offending child.

   [327] "The law, as it condemneth and curseth, is to the believer a mere
   passive and a naked stander-by, and has no activity, nor can it act in
   that power upon any in Christ; as the law of Spain is merely passive in
   condemning a free-born man dwelling in Scotland." Rutherford's Spirit.
   Antichrist, p. 87.--"The law being fully satisfied by Christ, it
   neither condemneth, nor can it condemn, to eternal sufferings, for that
   is removed from the law to all that are in Christ." Ibid.

   [328] For, according to the Scripture, the believer is dead to the law,
   and the law is dead to the believer; namely, as it is the law of the
   covenant of works.

   [329] Exact and perfect, comparatively, not absolutely.

   [330] The author speaks expressly of the love of God, touching
   believers' justification, and eternal salvation, which, according to
   the Scripture, he reckons to be given them already. And he asserts,
   That as no good in them, or done by them, did move him to love them, so
   as to justify them, and give them eternal life, so no evil in them or
   done by them, shall lessen that love, as to their justification and
   eternal salvation; that is, as himself explains it, move him to take
   eternal life [which includes justification] away from them, being once
   given. This is most firm truth; howbeit, the more and the greater the
   sins of a believer are, he may lay his account with the more and the
   greater effects of God's fatherly indignation against him; and the
   corruption of human nature makes the adding of such a clause in such a
   case very necessary. What our author here advances, is evident from the
   holy Scripture, (Psa 89:30-34), "If his children forsake my law, and
   walk not in my judgments, if they break my statutes, and keep not my
   commandments, then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and
   their iniquity with stripes: nevertheless, my loving-kindness will I
   not utterly take from him; nor suffer my faithfulness to fail; my
   covenant will I not break; nor alter the thing that is gone out of my
   lips." And to deny it, is in effect to affirm that God loves believers,
   as touching their justification and eternal salvation, for their
   holiness; contrary to Titus 3:5, "Not by works of righteousness which
   we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us."--(Rom 6:23),
   "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life,
   through Jesus Christ our Lord"; and that that love of his to them
   changeth according to the variations of their frame and walk; contrary
   to Romans 11:29, "The gifts and calling of God are without repentance."
   But while the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints stands, viz:
   That true believers can neither fall away totally, nor finally, neither
   from relative grace, nor from inherent grace, our author's doctrine on
   this point must stand also; and the sins of believers, how great or
   many soever they be, can never be of that kind which is inconsistent
   with a state of grace, nor of another than that of infirmities. And how
   low soever grace is brought in the soul of a believer at any time,
   through the prevalence of temptation, yet can he never altogether lose
   his inherent holiness, nor can he at any time "live after the flesh."
   For, according to the Scripture, that is not the spot of God's
   children; but he who so lives, neither is, nor ever was, one of them.
   (Rom 6:2,14), "How shall we that are dead to sin, live any longer
   therein? Sin shall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under the
   law but under grace."--(8:1), "Them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk
   not after the flesh, but after the Spirit." See verse 4; (1 John 3:9),
   "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth
   in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God." "God foresaw
   what infirmities thou wouldst have, before he gave Christ this
   commission; and Christ foresaw them before his acceptance of the
   charge. If their prescience could not stop God in his gift, nor cool
   Christ in his acceptance, why should it now? While they do continue,
   the love of God to thee is not hindered by them." Charnock, vol. 2, p.
   749. "Observe a twofold distinction: 1st. Between God's love in itself,
   and the manifestation of it to us. That is perpetual and one, without
   change, increase, or lessening: but the manifestation of his love is
   variable, according to our more or less careful exercise of piety. 2d.
   Between God's love to our persons, and God's love to our qualities and
   actions. A distinction which God well knows how to make. Parents, I am
   sure, are well skilled in putting this difference between the vices and
   persons of their children; those they hate, these they love. The case
   is alike between God and the elect; his love to their persons is from
   everlasting the same. Nor doth their sinfulness lessen it, nor their
   sanctity increase it; because God in loving their persons, never
   considered them otherwise than as most perfectly holy and unblamable in
   Christ," Pemble's Works, p. 23.

   [331] They are.

   [332] Though not for their obedience, but for Christ's obedience.

   [333] I read the last word of this sentence, Christ, not works, judging
   it plain, that the latter is a press error. See the last clause of
   Neophytus' speech above, and the reason here immediately following.

   [334] An awful penalty, if rightly understood, as comprehending all
   manner of strokes and afflictions on the outward and inner man, called
   by our author "temporal and spiritual afflictions on the outward man";
   not to speak of the reproach, disgrace and contempt, successless labour
   and toil, poverty, misery, want, and the like, which the believer is
   liable to for his disobedience, as well as others. His sins lay him
   open to the whole train of maladies, pains, torments, sores, diseases,
   and plagues, incident to sinful flesh; by which he may become a burden
   to himself and others. And these may be inflicted on him, not only by
   the hand of God, but by the hand of the devil; as appears in the case
   of Job. Yea, and the Lord may, in virtue of this penalty annexed to his
   law, pursue the controversy with the offending believer, even to death;
   so that his natural life may go in the cause of his transgression, (1
   Cor 11:30,32). To this may be added the marks of God's indignation
   against his sin, set upon his relations; witness the disorders,
   mischiefs, and strokes on David's family, for his sin in the matter of
   Uriah, more bitter than death, (2 Sam 12:10-14, chapter 13,14). In the
   inner man, by virtue of the same penalty, he is liable for his
   transgression, to be deprived of the comfort, sense, exercise, and some
   measure of his graces; of his sense of God's love, his peace, joy,
   actual communion with God, and access to him in duties; to be brought
   under desertion, hiding of God's face, withdrawing the light of the
   Lord's countenance: and left to walk in darkness, to go mourning
   without the sun, and to cry and shout while the Lord shutteth out his
   prayer; to be thrown into agonies of conscience, pierced with the
   arrows of the Almighty in his spirit, compassed about and distracted
   with the terrors of God, seized with the fearful apprehensions of God's
   revenging wrath against him, and thereby brought unto the brink of
   absolute despair. Besides all this, he is liable to the buffettings of
   Satan, and horrid temptations; and, for the punishment of one sin, to
   be suffered to fall into another. And all these may, in virtue of the
   penalty annexed to the law in the hand of Christ, meet in the case of
   the offending believer, together and at once. Thus, howbeit God no
   where threatens to cast believers in Christ into hell, yet he both
   threatens and often executes the casting of a hell into them, for their
   provocations. Only the revenging wrath and curse of God are no part of
   the penalty to believers in Christ, according to the truth and our
   author. But whether or not this penalty, as it is without these, leaves
   the most holy and awful law of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus
   Christ, most base and despicable, the sober-minded reader will easily
   judge for himself. "The one, viz: justification doth equally free all
   believers from the revenging wrath of God, and that perfectly in this
   life." Larger Cat. q. 77.--"They can never fall from the state of
   justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God's fatherly
   displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto
   them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and
   renew their faith and repentance." Westm. Confess. chap. 11, art.
   5.--"They may fall into grievous sins, and for a time continue therein,
   whereby they incur God's displeasure, and grieve his holy Spirit, come
   to be deprived of some measure of their graces and comforts, have their
   hearts hardened, and their consciences wounded; hurt and scandalize
   others, and bring temporal judgments upon themselves." Ibid. chap. 17.
   art. 3.--"The threatenings of it serve to show what even their sins
   deserve; and what afflictions, in this life, they may expect for them,
   although freed from the curse thereof threatened in the law." Ibid.
   chap. 19. art. 6.

   [335] Chos. Sermons, Serm. of the Kingdom of God, page 120.

   [336] (Matt 6:9,12), "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father
   which art in heaven; forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."

   [337] The subduing of sin is the mark of God's hearing prayer for the
   pardon of it; if one feels not his iniquity subdued, he cannot find
   that God hath heard his prayers for pardon.

   [338] To the producing of holy obedience, according to the measure and
   degree of it.

   [339] The author doth here no otherwise exhort the believer to yield
   free obedience, without respect to what either the law of works, or the
   law of Christ, promises or threatens, than he exhorts him to perfection
   of obedience, which, in the beginning of this answer, he told him not
   to be attainable in this life. And the truth is, neither the one nor
   the other is the design of these words. But he had exhorted him before,
   to use all means to increase his faith; and for his encouragement, he
   tells him here, that if he by faith applied the goodness of God in
   Christ to his own soul, in any good measure, then he would, answerably,
   yield obedience, without respect to what either the law of works, or
   the law of Christ promises or threatens, and only because God commands
   or forbids. The freeness of obedience is of very different degrees; and
   believers' obedience is never absolutely free, till it be absolutely
   perfect in heaven; but the freeness of their obedience will always bear
   proportion to the measure of their faith, which is never perfect in
   this life; thus, the more faith, the more freeness of obedience, and
   the less faith, the less of that freeness.

   [340] "The believer obeys with an angel-like obedience; then the Spirit
   seems to exhaust all the commanding awesomeness of the law, and
   supplies the law's imperious power, with the strength and power of
   love." Rutherford's Spirit. Antichrist, p. 318.--"The more of the
   Spirit, because the Spirit is essentially free, (Psa 51:12, 2 Cor
   3:17), the more freeness; and the more freeness, the more renewed will
   in the obedience; and the more renewed will, the less constraint,
   because freeness exhausteth constraint." Ibid. "When Christ's blood is
   seen by faith to quiet justice, then the conscience becomes quiet also,
   and will not suffer the heart to entertain the love of sin, but sets
   the man on work to fear God for his mercy, and obey all his
   commandments, out of love to God, for his free gift of justification,
   by grace bestowed upon him; for 'this is the end of the law' indeed,
   whereby it obtaineth of a man more obedience than any other way."
   Pract. Use of Sav. Knowledge, tit. The Third Thing Requisite, &c. fig.
   7. Promises and threatenings are not, by this doctrine, annexed to the
   holy law in vain, even with respect to believers; for the law of God
   is, in his infinite wisdom, suited to the state of the creature, to
   whom it is given: and therefore, howbeit the believer's eternal
   happiness is unalterably secured from the moment of his union with
   Christ by faith; yet, since sin dwells in him still while in this
   world, the promises of fatherly smiles, and threatenings of fatherly
   chastisements, are still necessary. But it is evident that this
   necessity is entirely founded on the believer's imperfection; as in
   case of a child under age. And, therefore, although his being
   influenced to obedience by the promises and threatenings of the law of
   Christ, is not indeed slavish, yet it is plainly childish, not agreeing
   to the state of a perfect man, of one come unto the measure of the
   stature of the fullness of Christ. And, in the state of perfection, he
   shall yield such free obedience as the angels do in heaven, without
   being moved thereto by any promises or threatenings at all: and the
   nearer he comes in his progress to that state of perfection, the more
   will his obedience be of that nature. So by the doctrine here advanced,
   the author doth no more disown the necessity of promises to influence
   and encourage the believer's obedience, nor say that he ought not to
   have regard to promises and threatenings, than one is to be reckoned to
   say, that a lame man has no need of, and should not have regard unto
   the crutches provided for him: when he only says, That the stronger his
   limbs grow, he will have less need of them, and will lean the less on
   them.

   [341] This Scriptural phrase is here aptly used, to intimate how men
   deceive themselves, thinking they are far from seeking to be justified
   by the works of the law, because they are convinced they cannot do good
   works in the perfection which the law requires: meanwhile, since God is
   merciful, and Christ hath died, they look for the pardon of their sins,
   and acceptance with God, upon the account of their own works, though
   attended with some imperfections: that is, "as it were, by the works of
   the law," (Rom 9:32).

   [342] This answer proceeds upon taking Neophytus to speak, not of the
   grace but of the doctrine of faith; namely, the foundation of faith, or
   ground of believing; as if he had desired to know whether the
   foundation of his faith was the true foundation of faith, or not. This
   is plain from the two following paragraphs. And upon the supposition
   that he had grounded his faith on the promise of the gospel, the tried
   foundation of faith, the author tells him, he would not have him make a
   question of that, having handled that question already at great length,
   and answered all his and Nomista's objections on the head, where
   Neophytus declared himself satisfied. And there is no inconsistency
   betwixt the author's advice in this case given to Neophytus, and the
   advice given in the text last cited unto the Corinthians, unreasonably
   and peevishly demanding a proof of Christ speaking in the apostle.
   Whether, with several judicious critics and commentators, we understand
   that text concerning the doctrine of faith, as if the apostle put them
   to try whether they retained the true doctrine or not; or, which is the
   common, and, I think, the true understanding of it, concerning the
   grace of faith; I see nothing here determining our author's opinion, as
   to the sense of it; but whether he seems here to be against
   self-examination, especially after he had urged that duty on
   Antinomista, and answered his objections against it, let the candid
   reader judge.

   [343] See the note on the Definition of Faith. "The assurance of
   Christ's righteousness is a direct act of faith, apprehending imputed
   righteousness: the evidence of our justification we now speak of, is
   the reflex light, not by which we are justified, but by which we know
   that we are justified." Rutherford's Christ Dying and Drawing, p.
   111.--"We had never a question with Antinomians touching the first
   assurance of justification, such as is proper to the light of faith. He
   might have spared all his arguments to prove, that we are first assured
   of our justification by faith, not by good works, for we grant the
   arguments of one sort of assurance, which is proper to faith; and they
   prove nothing against another sort of assurance, by signs and effects,
   which is also divine." Ibid. p. 110.

   [344] A good reason why this assurance, in or by the direct act of
   faith, is to be tried by marks and signs. There is certainly a
   persuasion that "cometh not of him that called us"; which obliges men
   to examine their persuasion, whether it be of the right sort or not.

   [345] This is called assurance by a reflex act.

   [346] In virtue of the deed of gift and grant. See the note on the
   definition of faith, fig. 1.

   [347] So the Margin reads it.

   [348] This forcing one's self to yield obedience, which the author
   warns Christians against, when they have lost sight of their evidences,
   and would fain recover them, is by pressing to yield obedience, without
   believing, till once by their obedience they have recovered the
   evidence of their having faith. To advise a Christian to beware of
   taking this course, in this case, is not to favour laxness, but to
   guard him against beginning his work at the wrong end, and so labouring
   in vain; for obeying, indeed, must still spring from believing, since
   "without faith it is impossible to please god," (Heb 11:6). And
   "whatsoever is not of faith, is sin," (Rom 14:23). The following advice
   sets the matter in full light.

   [349] Namely, obedience, whereby you shall recover dence.

   [350] Demanding satisfaction.

   [351] That is, even unto.

   [352] But you yourself were not to come near unto him, nay, we must
   "come unto God by Christ," (Heb 7:25).

   [353] Namely, believed the promise of sanctification, (Eze 36:27, Micah
   7:19), which belief brings always along with it the use of the means,
   that are of divine institution, for that end.

Chapter IV, OF THE HEART'S HAPPINESS, OR

SOUL'S REST.

Section 1, No rest for the soul till it come to God.

   Neo. Sir, be pleased to give me leave to tell you some part of my mind,
   and then I will cease to trouble you any more at this time. The truth
   is, I have, ever since I could remember, felt a kind of restless
   discontentedness in my spirit, and for many years together, I fed
   myself with hopes of finding rest and content in persons and things
   here below, scarce thinking of the state and condition of my soul, or
   of any condition beyond this life, until, as I told you before, the
   Lord was pleased to visit me with a fit of sickness; and then I began
   to bethink myself of death, judgment, hell, and heaven, and to take
   care and seek rest for my soul, as well as for my body; but, alas! I
   could never find rest for it before this day; because,, indeed, I
   sought it not by faith, but, as it were, by the works of the law; or,
   in plain terms, because I sought it not in Christ but in myself. But
   now, I bless God, I see that Christ is all in all; and therefore, by
   the grace of God, I am resolved no longer to seek rest and content,
   neither in any earthly thing, nor in mine own righteousness, but only
   in the free love and favour of God, as he is in his Son Jesus Christ;
   and, God willing, there shall be my soul's rest. And I beseech you,
   sir, pray for me, that it may be so; and I have done.

   Evan. This point, concerning the heart's happiness, or soul's rest, is
   a point very needful for us to know; and indeed, it is a point that I
   have formerly thought upon; and therefore, though my occasions do now
   begin to call me away from you, yet, nevertheless, since you have begun
   to speak of it, I shall, if you please, proceed on, if you shall, or
   any of you, give occasion, and as the Lord shall enable me.

   Ant. With a very good will, sir; for indeed it is a point that I much
   desire to hear of.

   Evan. First, then, I would entreat you to consider with me, that when
   God at first gave man an elementish body, [354] he did also infuse into
   him an immortal soul of a spiritual substance; and though he gave his
   soul a local being in his body, yet he gave it a spiritual well-being
   in himself; so that the soul was in the body by location and at rest in
   God by union and communication; and this being of the soul in God at
   first was man's true being, and his true happiness. Now man falling
   from God, God in his justice left man, so that the actual union and
   communion that the soul of man had with God at first is broken off; God
   and man's soul are parted; and it is in a restless condition. Howbeit,
   the Lord having seated in man's soul a certain character of himself,
   the soul is thereby made to re-aspire towards that summum bonum, that
   chief good, even God himself, and can find rest no where, till it come
   to him. [355]

   Nom. But stay, sir, I pray you; how can it be said that man's soul doth
   re-aspire towards God the Creator, when it is evident that every man's
   soul naturally is bent towards the creature, to seek a rest there?

   Evan. For answer hereunto I pray you consider, that naturally man's
   understanding is dark and blind; and therefore is ignorant what his own
   soul does desire and strongly aspire unto. It knoweth, indeed, that
   there is a want in the soul; but till it be enlightened, it knoweth not
   what it is which the soul wanteth. For, indeed, the case standeth with
   the soul as with a child new born, which child, by natural instinct,
   doth gape and cry for nutriment; yea, for such nutriment as may agree
   with its tender condition; and if the nurse, through negligence or
   ignorance, either give it no meat at all, or else such as it is not
   capable of receiving, the child refuses it, and still cries, in
   strength of desire, after the breast; yet does not the child, in this
   estate, know by any intellectual power and understanding what itself
   desires. Even so man's poor soul doth cry to God as for its proper
   nourishment; [356] but his understanding, like a blind, ignorant nurse,
   not knowing what it cries for, offers to the heart a creature instead
   of a Creator; thus, by reason of the blindness of the understanding,
   together with the corruption of the will, and disorder of the
   affections, man's soul is kept by violence [357] from its proper
   centre, even God himself.

Chapter IV, Section 2

   How the soul is kept from rest in God.

   Oh, how many souls are there in the world that are hindered, if not
   quite kept, from rest in God, by reason that their blind understanding
   presents unto their sensual appetites varieties of sensual objects!

   Is there not many a luxurious person's soul hindered, if not quite
   kept, from true rest in God, by that beauty which nature hath placed in
   feminine faces, [358] especially when Satan secretly suggests into such
   feminine hearts a desire of an artificial dressing, from the head to
   the foot; yea, and sometimes painting the face, like their mother
   Jezebel?

   And is there not many a voluptuous epicure's soul hindered, if not
   quite kept, from rest in God, by beholding the colour, and tasting the
   sweetness of dainty delicate dishes, his wine red in the cup and his
   beer of amber colour in the glass? In the Scripture we read of a
   "certain man that fared deliciously every day," as if there had been no
   more than one so ill disposed; but in our times, there are certain
   hundreds, both of men and women, that do not only fare deliciously, but
   voluptuously, twice every day, if not more.

   And is there not many a proud person's soul hindered, if not quite
   kept, from rest in God, by the harmonious sound of popular praise
   which, like a loadstone, draws the vain-glorious heart to hunt so much
   the more eagerly, to augment the echo of such vain windy reputation?

   And is there not many a covetous person's soul hindered, if not quite
   kept, from rest in God, by the cry of great abundance, the words of
   wealth, and the glory of gain?

   And is there not many a musical mind hindered, if not quite kept, from
   sweet comfort in God, by the harmony of artificial concord upon musical
   instruments?

   And how many perfumed fools are there in the world, who, by smelling
   their sweet apparel, and their sweet nosegays, are kept from soul
   sweetness in Christ? And thus does Satan, like a cunning fisher, bait
   his hook with a sensual object, to catch men with: and having gotten it
   into their jaws, he draws them up and down in sensual contentments,
   till he has so drowned them therein, that the peace and rest of their
   souls in God is almost forgotten. And hence it is that the greatest
   part of man's life, and in many their whole life, is spent in seeking
   satisfaction to the sensual appetite.

   Nom. Indeed, sir, this which you have said, we may see truly verified
   in many men, who spend their days about these vanities, and will afford
   no time for religious exercises; no, not upon the Lord's day, by their
   good will.

   Evan. You say the truth; and yet let me tell you withal, that a man by
   the power of natural conscience, may be forced to confess that his
   hopes of happiness are in God alone, and not in these things; yea, and
   to forsake profits and pleasures, and all sensual objects, as unable to
   give his soul any true contentment, and fall to the performance of
   religious exercises, and yet rest there, and never come to God for
   rest. And if we consider it, either in the rude multitude of sensual
   livers, or in the more seemingly religious, we shall perceive that the
   religious exercises of men do strongly deceive, and strangely delude
   many men of their heart's happiness in God.

   For the first sort, [359] though they be such as make their belly their
   best god, and do no sacrifice but to Bacchus, Apollo, or Venus; [360]
   though their conscience do accuse them that these things are naught,
   yet in that they have the name of Christians put upon them in their
   baptism, and forasmuch as they do often repeat the Lord's prayer, the
   apostles' creed, and the ten commandments, and in that, it may be, they
   have lately accustomed themselves to go to church, to hear divine
   service, and a preaching now and then, and in that they have divers
   times received the sacrament; they will not be persuaded but that God
   is well pleased with them; and a man may as well persuade them that
   they are not men and women, as that they are not in a good condition.

   And for the second sort, [361] that ordinarily have more human wisdom
   and human learning than the former sort, and seem to be more holy and
   devout than the former sort of sensual ignorant people; yet how many
   are there of this sort, that never pass further than the outward court
   of bodily performances: feeding and feasting themselves, as men in a
   dream; supposing themselves to have all things, and yet indeed have
   nothing but only a bladder-full, or rather a brain-full, of wind and
   worldly conceptions?

   Are there not some who give themselves to more special searching and
   seeking out for knowledge in Scripture learnedness and clerk-like
   skill, in this art, and that language, till they come to be able to
   repeat all the historical places in the Bible; yea, and all those texts
   of Scripture that they conceive do make for some private opinion of
   theirs concerning ceremonies, church-government, or other such
   circumstantial points of religion, touching which points they are very
   able to reason and dispute, and to put forth such curious questions as
   are not easily answered?

   Are not some of these men [362] called sect-makers, and begetters or
   devisers of new opinions in religion; especially in the matter of
   worshipping God, as they use to call it, wherein they find a beginning,
   but hardly an end? For this religious knowledge is so variable, through
   the multiplicity of curious wits and contentious spirits, that the life
   of man may seem too short to take a full view of this variety; for
   though all sects say they will be guided by the word of truth, and all
   seem to bring Scripture, which, indeed, is but one, as God is but one;
   yet, by reason of their several constructions and interpretations of
   Scripture, and conceits of their own human wisdom, they are many.

   And are there not others of this sort of men that are ready to embrace
   any new way of worship, especially if it come under the cloak of
   Scripture learning, and have a show of truth, founded upon the letter
   of the bible, and seem to be more zealous and devout than the former
   way? especially if the teacher of that new way can but frame a sad and
   demure countenance, and with a grace lift up his head and his eyes
   towards heaven, with some strong groan, in declaring of his newly
   conceived opinion; and that he frequently use this phrase of--the glory
   of God! Oh, then, these men are, by-and-by, of another opinion!
   supposing to themselves that God has made known some further truth to
   them; for by reason of the blindness of their understanding, they are
   not able to reach any supernatural truth, although they do, by literal
   learning, and clerk-like cunning, dive ever so deep into the
   Scriptures; and therefore they are ready to entertain any form of
   religious exercises, as shall be suggested unto them.

   And are there not a third sort, much like to these men, that are
   excessive and mutable in the performance of religious exercises? Surely
   St. Paul perceived that this was the very God of some men in his time,
   and therefore he willeth Timothy to instruct others, that "bodily
   exercise profiteth little," or, as some read it, "nothing at all"; and
   doth oppose thereunto "godliness," as being another thing than "bodily
   exercise," and says that it "is profitable," &c.

   And do not you think that there are some men at this day that know none
   other good than bodily exercise, and can hardly distinguish betwixt it
   and godliness? Now these bodily exercises are mutable and variable,
   according to their conceits and opinions; for all sects have their
   several services, as they call them yet all bodily, and for the most
   part, only bodily; the which they perform to establish a rest to their
   souls, because they want rest in God. And hence it is that their peace
   and rest are up and down, according to their working better or worse.
   So many chapters must be read, and so many sermons must be heard, and
   so many times they must pray in one day, and so many days in the week,
   or in the year, they must fast, &c., or else their souls can have no
   rest. But mistake me not, I pray, in imagining that I speak against the
   doing of these things, for I do them all myself, but against resting in
   the doing of them, the which I desire not to do.

   And thus you see that men's blind understanding doth not only present
   unto the sensual appetite sensual objects, but also to the rational
   appetite rational objects; so that man's poor soul is not only kept
   from rest in God by means of sensuality, but also by means of
   formality. If Satan cannot keep us from rest in God by feeding our
   senses with our mother Eve's apple, then he attempts to do it by
   blinding our eyes, and so hindering us from seeing the paths of the
   gospel. If he cannot keep us in Egypt by the flesh-pots of sensuality,
   then will he make us wander in the wilderness of religious and rational
   formality: so that if he cannot hinder us more grossly, then he
   attempts to do it more closely.

   Nom. But sir, I am persuaded that there be many men that are so
   religiously exercised, and do perform such duties as you have
   mentioned, and yet rest not in them but in God.

   Evan. Questionless there be some Christians that look upon such
   exercises as means ordained of God both to beget and increase faith,
   and all other graces of his Spirit, in the hearts of his people; and
   therefore, to the intent that their faith, and love, and other graces,
   may increase, they are careful to wait upon God, in taking all
   convenient opportunities to exercise themselves therein, and yet have
   their soul's rest in God, and not in such exercises.

   But, alas! I fear the number of such men is very few, in comparison of
   them that do otherwise. For do not the most part of men that are so
   religiously exercised, rather conceive, that as they have offended and
   displeased God by their former disobedience, so they must pacify and
   appease him by their future obedience? And therefore they are careful
   to exercise themselves in this way of duty, and that way of worship,
   and all to that end; yea, and they conceiving that they have corrupted
   and defiled, and polluted themselves, by their falling into sin, they
   must also purge, cleanse, and purify themselves, by rising out of sin,
   and walking in new obedience: [363] and so all the good they do, and
   all the evil they eschew, is to pacify God, and appease their own
   consciences. And if they seek rest to their souls this way, why, it is
   the way of the covenant of works, where they shall never be able to
   reach God; nay, it is the way to come to God out of Christ, where they
   shall never be able to come near him, he being a "consuming fire."

   Nom. But, sir, I pray you, would you not have our senses to be any
   longer exercised about any of their objects? would you have us no
   longer to take comfort in the good things of this life?

   Evan. I pray you, do not mistake me; I do not speak as though I would
   have you stoically to refuse the lawful use of any of the Lord's good
   creatures, which he shall be pleased to afford you, neither do I
   prohibit you from all comfort therein; but this is it which I do
   desire, namely, that you would endeavour to attain to such a peace,
   rest, and content in God, as he is in Christ, that the violent cry of
   your heart may be restrained, and that your appetites may not be so
   forcible, nor so unruly as they are naturally, but that the unruliness
   thereof may be brought into a very comely decorum and order: so that
   your sensual appetites may, with much more easiness and contentedness,
   be denied the objects of their desires, yea, and contented [if occasion
   be] with that which is most repugnant to them, as with hunger, cold,
   nakedness, yea, and with death itself. For such is the wonderful
   working of the heart's quiet and rest in God, that although a man's
   senses be still exercised in and upon their proper objects, yet may it
   be truly said, that such a man's life is not sensual. For indeed his
   heart taketh little contentment in any such exercises, it being for the
   most part exercised in a more transcendent communion with God, as he is
   in Christ. So that indeed the man that has this peace and rest in God
   may be truly said to "use this world as though he used it not," in that
   he receives no cordial contentment from any sensual exercise
   whatsoever, and that because his heart is withdrawn from them. Which
   withdrawing of the heart is not unaptly pointed at, in the speech of
   the spouse, (Cant 5:2), "I sleep," says she, "but my heart waketh."
   Even so may it be said, that such a man is sleeping, looking, hearing,
   tasting, smelling, eating, drinking, feasting, &c., but his heart is
   withdrawn from the creature, and rejoicing in God his Saviour, and his
   soul is magnifying his Lord; so that in the midst of all sensual
   delights, his heart secretly says, Aye, but my happiness is not here.

   Nom. But, sir, I pray you, why do you call rational and religious
   exercises a wilderness?

   Evan. For two reasons; first, Because that as the children of Israel,
   when they were got out of Egypt, did yet wander many years in the
   wilderness, before they came into the land of Canaan; even so do many
   men wander long in rational and religious exercises, after they have
   left a sensual life, before they come to rest in God, whereof the land
   of Canaan was a type. [364] Secondly, Because, as in a wilderness men
   often lose themselves, and can find no way out, but supposing, after
   long travel, that they are nearer the place whither they would go, are
   in truth, farther off; even so fareth it with many, yea, with all such
   as walk in the way of reason; [365] they lose themselves in the woods
   and bushes of their works and doings; so that the longer they travel,
   the farther they are from God, and true rest in him.

   Nom. But, sir, you know that the Lord hath endowed us with reasonable
   souls; would you not then have us to make use of our reason?

   Evan. I pray you, do not mistake me: I do not contemn nor despise the
   use of reason; only I would not have you to establish it to [366] the
   chief good; but I would have you to keep it under; so that, if with
   Hagar, it attempt to bear rule, and lord it over your faith, then would
   I have you, in the wisdom of God, like Sarah, to cast it out from
   having dominion. In few words, I would have you more strong in desire
   than curious in speculation, and to long more to feel communion with
   God than to be able to dispute of the genus or species of any question,
   either human or divine; and press hard to know God by powerful
   experience. And though your knowledge be great, and your obedience
   surpassing many, yet would I have you to be truly nullified,
   annihilated, and made nothing and become fools in all fleshly wisdom;
   and glory in nothing, but only in the Lord. [367] And I would have you,
   with the eye of faith, sweetly to behold all things extracted out of
   one thing; and in one to see all. [368] In a word, I would have in you
   a most profound silence, contemning all curious questions and
   discourses; and to ponder much in your heart, but prate little with
   your tongue. "Be swift to hear," but "slow to speak," and "slow to
   wrath," as the apostle James advises you, (James 1:19); and by this
   means will your reason be subdued, and become one with your faith, for
   then is reason one with faith, when it is subjugated unto faith; and
   then will reason keep its true lists and limits, and you will become
   ten times more reasonable than you were before. So that I hope you now
   see that the heart's farewell from the sensual and rational life is not
   to be considered absolutely, but respectively; it does not consist in a
   going out of either, but in a right use of both.

Chapter IV, Section 3

   God in Christ the only true rest for the soul.

   Nom. Then, sir, it seems to me, that God in Christ, apprehended by
   faith, is the only true rest for man's soul.

   Evan. There is the true rest indeed; there is the rest which David
   invites his soul unto, when he says, "Return unto thy rest, O my soul!
   for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee," (Psa 116:7).--"For we
   which have believed," says the author to the Hebrews, "have entered
   into his rest," [369] (Heb 4:3).--And "Come unto me," says Christ, "all
   ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," [370]
   (Matt 11:28). And truly, my neighbours and friends, believe it, we
   shall never find a heart's happiness, and true soul's rest, until we
   find it here. For howsoever a man may think, if he had this man's wit,
   and that man's wealth, this man's honour and that man's pleasure, this
   wife, or that husband, such children, and such servants, his heart
   would be satisfied, and his soul would be contented; yet which of us
   hath not, by our own experience, found the contrary? For, not long
   after that we have obtained the thing we did so much desire, and
   wherein we promised ourselves so much happiness, rest, and content, we
   have found nothing but vanity and emptiness in it. Let a man but deal
   plainly with his own heart, and he shall find, that, notwithstanding he
   hath many things, yet there is ever one thing wanting: for indeed man's
   soul cannot be satisfied with any creature, no, not with a world of
   creatures. And the reason is, because the desires of man's soul are
   infinite, according to that infinite goodness which it once lost in
   losing God. Yea, and man's soul is a spirit; and therefore cannot
   communicate with any corporal thing; so that all creatures, not being
   that infinite and spiritual fullness which our hearts have lost, and
   towards the which they do still re-aspire; they cannot give it full
   contentment.

   Nay, let me say more; howsoever a man may, in the midst of his sensual
   fullness, be convinced in his conscience that he is at enmity with God,
   and therefore in danger of his wrath and eternal damnation; and be
   thereupon moved to reform his life and amend his ways, and endeavour to
   seek peace and rest to his soul; yet this being in the way of works, it
   is impossible that he should find it; for his conscience will ever be
   accusing him, that this good duty he ought to have done, and has not
   done it; and this evil he ought to have forborne, and yet he has done
   it; and in the performance of this duty he was remiss, and in that duty
   very defective; and many such ways will his soul be disquieted.

   But when a man once comes to believe, that all his sins both past,
   present, and to come, are freely and fully pardoned, [371] and God in
   Christ graciously reconciled unto him, the Lord doth thereupon so
   reveal his fatherly face unto him in Christ, and so make known that
   incredible union betwixt him and the believing soul, that his heart
   becomes quietly contented in God, who is the proper element of its
   being; for hereupon there comes into the soul such peace, flowing from
   the God of peace, that it fills the emptiness of his soul with true
   fullness, in the fullness of God, so that now the heart ceases to
   molest the understanding and reason, in seeking either variety of
   objects, or augmentation of degrees, in any comprehensible thing; and
   that because the restless longing of the mind which did before cause
   unquietness and disorder, both in the variety of mental projects, and
   also in the sensual and beastly exercises of the corporal and external
   members, is satisfied and truly quieted. For when a man's heart is at
   peace in God, and is become truly full in that peace and joy passing
   understanding, then the devil hath not that hope to prevail against his
   soul as he had before; he knows right well that it is in vain to bait
   his hook with profits, pleasures, honour, or any other such like
   seeming good, to catch such a soul that is thus at quiet in God; for he
   hath all fullness in God, and what can be added to fullness but it
   runneth over? Indeed, empty hearts, like empty hogsheads, are fit to
   receive any matter which shall be put into them; but the heart of the
   believer being filled with joy and peace in believing, doth abhor all
   such base allurements; for that it hath no room in itself to receive
   any such seeming contentments. So that, to speak as the truth is, there
   is nothing that doth truly and unfeignedly root wickedness out of the
   heart of man, but only the true tranquility of the mind, or the rest of
   the soul in God. And, to say as the thing is, this is such a peace, and
   such a rest to the creature in the Creator, that, according to the
   measure of its establishment by faith, no created comprehensible thing
   can either add to it, or detract from it; the increase of a kingdom
   cannot augment it, the greatest losses and crosses in worldly things
   cannot diminish it; a believer's good works do all flow from it, and
   ought not to return to it; [372] neither ought human frailties to
   molest it. [373] However, this is most certain, neither sin nor Satan,
   law nor conscience, hell nor grave, can quite extinguish it; for it is
   the Lord alone that gives and maintains it. "Whom have I in heaven but
   thee?" says David, "and there is none upon earth that I desire besides
   thee." (Psa 73:25) It is the pleasant face of God in Christ that puts
   gladness into his heart, (Psa 4:7). And when that face is hid, then he
   is troubled, (Psa 30:7). But, to speak more plainly, though the peace
   and joy of true believers may be extenuated or diminished, yet doth the
   testimony of their being in nature [374] remain so strong, that they
   could skill to say, yea, even when they have felt God to be withdrawing
   himself from them,--"My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?" (Psa
   22:1); yea, and in the night of God's absence to remain confident, that
   though sorrow be over night, yet joy will come in the morning, (Psa
   30:5); nay, though the Lord should seem to kill them with unkindness,
   "yet they will put their trust in him," (Job 13:15); knowing that for
   all this "their Redeemer liveth," (Job 19:25); so strong is "the joy of
   their Lord," (Neh 8:10). These are the people that are kept in perfect
   peace, because their minds are stayed in the Lord, (Isa 26:3).

   Wherefore, my dear friends and loving neighbours, I beseech you to take
   heed of deeming any estate happy, until you come to find this true
   peace and rest to your souls in God. Oh, beware, lest any of you do
   content yourselves with a peace rather of speculation than of power!
   Oh, be not satisfied with such a peace as consists either in the act of
   oblivion or neglect of examination! nor yet in any brain- sick
   supposition of knowledge, theological or divine; and so frame rational
   conclusions, to protract time and still the cries of an accusing
   conscience. But let your hearts take their last farewell of false
   felicities, wherewith they have been, all of them, more or less,
   detained and kept from their true rest. Oh, be strong in resolution!
   and bid them all farewell; for what have your souls to do any longer
   among these gross, thick, and bodily things here below, that you should
   set your love upon them, or see happiness in them? your souls are of a
   higher and purer nature; and therefore their well-being must be sought
   in something that is higher and purer than they, even in God himself.

   True it is, that we are all of us, indeed, too unclean to touch God in
   immediate unity; but yet there is a pure counterpart of our natures,
   [375] and that pure humanity is immediately knit to the purest Deity;
   and by that immediate union you may come to a mediate union; for the
   Deity and that humanity being united, make one Saviour, head, and
   husband of souls. And so you being married to him, that is, God in him,
   you come also to be one with God: he one by a personal union, and you
   one by a mystical. Clear up then your eye, and fix it on him, as on the
   fairest of men, the perfection of a spiritual beauty, the treasure
   heavenly joy, the true object of most fervent love. Let your spirits
   look, and long, and seek after this Lord: let your souls cleave to him,
   let them hang about him, and never leave him, till he be brought into
   the chambers of your souls; yea, tell him resolutely, you will not
   leave him, till you hear his voice in your souls, saying, "My
   well-beloved is mine, and I am his"; yea, and tell him, you are "sick
   of love." Let your souls go, as it were, out of your bodies and out of
   the world, by heavenly contemplations; and treading upon the earth with
   the bottom of your feet, stretch your souls up, to look over the world,
   into that upper world, where her treasure is, [376] and where her
   beloved dwelleth.

   And when any of your souls shall thus forget her own people, her
   father's house, Christ her King shall so desire her beauty, (Psa
   45:10,11), and be so much in love with her, that, like a loadstone,
   this love of his shall draw the soul in pure desire to him again; and
   then, "as the hart panteth after the rivers of waters, so will your
   soul pant after God," (Psa 42:1).

   And then, according to the measure of your faith, your souls shall come
   to have a real rest in God, and be filled with joy unspeakable and
   glorious.

   Wherefore, I beseech you, set your mouths to this fountain Christ, and
   so shall your souls be filled with the water of life, with the oil of
   gladness, and with the new wine of the kingdom of God; from him you
   shall have weighty joys, sweet embracements, and ravishing
   consolations. And how can it be otherwise, when your souls shall really
   communicate with God, and by faith have a true taste, and by the spirit
   have a sure earnest of all heavenly preferments; having, as it were,
   one foot in heaven, whilst you live upon earth? Oh then, what an
   eucharistical love [377] will arise from your thankful hearts,
   extending itself first towards God, and then towards man for God's
   sake! and then, according to the measure of your faith, will be your
   willing obedience to God, and also to man for God's sake; for obedience
   being the kindly fruit of love, a loving soul bringeth forth this fruit
   as kindly as a good tree bringeth forth her fruit; for the soul, having
   tasted Christ in a heavenly communion, so loves him, that to please him
   is a pleasure and delight to herself: and the more Christ Jesus comes
   into the soul by his Spirit, the more spiritual he makes her; and turns
   her will into his will, making her of one heart, mind, and will, with
   him.

   So that, for a conclusion, this I say, that if the everlasting love of
   God in Jesus Christ be truly made known to your souls, according to the
   measure thereof, you shall have no need to frame and force yourselves
   to love and do good works, for your souls will ever stand bound [378]
   to love God, and to keep his commandments, and it will be your meat and
   drink to do his will. And truly this love of God will cut down
   self-love and love of the world, for the sweetness of Christ's Spirit
   will turn the sweetness of the flesh into bitterness, and the sweetness
   of the world into contempt. And if you can behold Christ with open
   face, you shall see and feel things unutterable, and be changed from
   beauty to beauty, from glory to glory, by the Spirit of this Lord, and
   so be happy in this life, in your union with happiness, and happy
   hereafter in the full fruition of happiness: [379] whither the Lord
   Jesus Christ bring us all in his due time. Amen.

   [354] That is an elementary body, made up, as it were, of the four
   elements, as they are called, namely, fire, air, earth, and water.

   [355] The soul of man has a natural desire of happiness: nothing can
   make it happy but what is commensurable to its desires, or capable of
   affording it a full satisfaction. Nothing less than an infinite good is
   such: and God himself only is an infinite good, in the enjoyment of
   which the soul can rest, as fully satisfied, desiring no more. Now,
   since by reason of the vast capacity of the soul, nothing but God
   himself can indeed satisfy this its desire of happiness, the which is
   so woven into the very nature of the soul, that nothing but the
   destruction of the very being of the soul can remove it; it is evident,
   that it is impossible the soul of man can ever find true rest, until it
   return to God, and take up its rest with him; but must still be in
   quest of, or desiring its chief good and happiness, wherein it may
   rest, and this in reality is God himself only; though the practical
   understanding being blinded, knows not that, and the perverse will and
   affections carry away the soul from him, seeking the desired good and
   happiness in other things. This is what the author calls the soul's
   re-aspiring towards the chief good, even God himself; and it is so
   consistent with the total depravation of man's nature, that it will
   remain for ever in the damned in hell; a chief part of whose misery
   will lie in that this desire shall ever be rampant in them, but never
   in the least satisfied; they shall never be freed from this scorching
   thirst there, nor yet get a drop of water to cool the tongue.

   [356] Man's poor soul, before it is enlightened, naturally cries to
   God, as the "young ravens cry to him," (Job 38:41), not knowing to
   whom: and it cries for him as its proper nourishment, as the new born
   infant for the breast, not knowing for what. Only it feels a want,
   desires supply proper for filling it up, and can never get kindly rest
   till it be supplied accordingly, that is, till it come to the enjoyment
   of God: then it rests, as the infant set to the full breast. (Isa
   66:11), "That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her
   consolations."

   [357] Namely, violence done to its natural make and constitution [if I
   may so express it] by the blindness, corruption, and disorder, that
   have seized its faculties.

   [358] That is, women's faces.

   [359] Namely, sensual livers, who yet perform religious exercises.

   [360] That is, give up themselves to drunkenness, music, and
   lasciviousness.

   [361] Namely, the more seemingly religious.

   [362] Namely, of those spoken of in the paragraph immediately
   preceding, whom he begins to distribute here into three classes or
   sorts; all belonging to the second sort, viz: the more seemingly
   religious.

   [363] Neglecting to wash, by faith, in the blood of Christ, the
   "Fountain opened for sin, and for uncleanness," (Zech 13:1).--"The
   blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanseth us from all sin," (1 John
   1:17).--"How much more shall the blood of Christ purge your conscience
   from dead works?" (Heb 9:14).--"Purifying their hearts by faith," (Acts
   15:9).

   [364] Such a wanderer our author himself had been for a dozen of years.
   See his Preface, and compare that heavy word, (Eccl 10:15), "The labour
   of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how
   to go to the city."

   [365] Namely, of reason, as the judge and rule in religion. The holy
   Scripture is the rule, and the Spirit of God therein speaking is the
   judge; it is the business of our reason to discern what they teach, and
   to submit thereto without reserve.

   [366] That is, for, or to be.

   [367] (2 Cor 12:11), "Though I be nothing."--(1 Cor 3:18), "Let him
   become a fool, that he may be wise."--(1:31), "He that glorieth, let
   him glory in the Lord."

   [368] According to that saying of our Lord, (Matt 19:17), "There is
   none good but one, that is God."

   [369] "Do enter into rest," or that rest, viz: "his rest." He means,
   that we even now enter into that rest by faith. Compare verse 10.

   [370] This is one of the most solemn gospel offfers to be found in all
   the New Testament; and our author seems here to point at what I
   conceive to be the true and genuine sense of it. The words "labour and
   heavy laden," do not restrict the invitation and offer to such as are
   sensible of their sins, and longing to be rid of them, though indeed
   none but such will really accept; but they denote the restlessness of
   the sinful soul of man; a qualification [if it is so called] to be
   found in all that are out of Christ, whether they have, or have not,
   any notable law work on their consciences. I say notable, to
   distinguish it from that which is common to all men, even to heathens,
   (Rom 11:15). Our father Adam led his whole family away out of their
   rest in God; and so left them with a conscience full of guilt, and a
   heart full of unsatisfied desires. Hence his children soon find
   themselves like the horse-leech, having "two daughters, crying, Give,
   give"; namely, a restless conscience, and a restless heart; and to each
   of these the poor soul must needs say, as Naomi said to Ruth, "My
   daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee?" so the blinded soul falls a
   labouring for rest to them. And it labours in the barren region of the
   fiery law for a rest to the conscience, and in the empty creation, for
   a rest to the heart: but, after all, the conscience is still heavy
   laden with guilt, whether it has any lively feeling thereof, or not;
   and the heart is still under a load of unsatisfied desires; so neither
   the one nor the other can find rest indeed. This is the natural case of
   all men. And to souls thus labouring, and laden, Jesus Christ here
   calls, that they may "come to him, and he will give them rest"; namely,
   a rest for their consciences, under the covert of his blood; and a rest
   to their hearts, in the enjoyment of God through him. This is most
   agreeable to the Scripture phraseology, (Eccl 10:15), "The labour of
   the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knows not how to go
   to the city."--(Hab 2:13), "The people shall labour in the very fire,
   and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity."--(Isa 55:2),
   "Wherefore do ye spend your labour for that which satisfieth not?" The
   prophet laments over a people more insensible than the ox or the ass,
   saying, "Ah, sinful nation! a people laden with iniquity," (Isa 1:3,4).
   And the apostle speaks of "silly women laden with sins, led away with
   divers lusts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of
   the truth," (2 Tim 3:6,7).

   [371] Namely, in respect of the guilt of eternal wrath.

   [372] Namely, to be any part of the fountain of it, for the time to
   come: as the rivers return unto the sea, whence they came, making a
   part of the store for their own fresh supply; nay, it is the Lord alone
   that gives and maintains it, as our author afterwards expresses it.

   [373] For these we are never free from in this life. And true
   repentance, and gospel mourning for sin, are so consistent with it,
   that they flow from it, according to the measure thereof. (Psa 65:3),
   "Iniquities prevail against me; as for our transgression, thou shalt
   purge them away."--(Zech 12:10), "They shall look upon me, whom they
   have pierced, and they shall mourn."

   [374] That is, the evidence, that they [viz: the peace and joy of
   believers] are still in being [in rerum natura] and not quite extinct.

   [375] Namely, the pure and spotless human nature of Christ.

   [376] Your soul's.

   [377] A love of thanksgiving, bearing thankfulness in its nature.

   [378] Or constrained by the force of that love.

   [379] That is, of God himself in Christ.

Conclusion.

   "And now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace,
   which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all
   them which are sanctified," (Acts 20:32).

   Neo. Well, sir, at this time I will say no more, but that it was a
   happy hour wherein I came to you, and a happy conference that we have
   had together. Surely, sir, I never knew Christ before this day. Oh,
   what cause have I to thank the Lord for my coming hither, and my two
   friends as a means of it! and, sir, for the pains that you have taken
   with me, I pray the Lord to requite you; and so beseeching you to pray
   the Lord to increase my faith, and to help my unbelief, I humbly take
   my leave of you, praying, "the God of love and peace to be with you."

   Nom. And truly, sir, I do believe that I have cause to speak as much in
   that case as he has; for though I have outstript him in knowledge, and
   it may be also in strict walking, yet do I now see, that my ac tions
   were neither from a right principle, nor to a right end; and,
   therefore, have I been in no better a condition than he. and truly,
   sir, I must needs confess, I never heard so much of Christ and the
   covenant of grace, as I have done this day. [380] The Lord make it
   profitable to me; and I beseech you, sir, pray for me.

   Ant. And truly, sir, I am now fully convinced that I have gone out of
   the right way, in that I have not had regard to the law, and the works
   thereof, as I should; but, God willing, I shall hereafter [if the Lord
   prolong my days] be more careful how I lead my life, seeing the ten
   commandments are the law of Christ; and I beseech you, sir, remember me
   in your prayers. And so, with many thanks to you for your pains, I take
   my leave of you, beseeching the "grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to be
   with your spirit." Amen.

   Evan. "Now, the very God of peace that brought again from the dead our
   Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the
   everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work, to do his
   will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through
   Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen." (Heb
   13:20,21)--(John 8:36), "If the Son make you free, you shall be free
   indeed."--(Gal 5:1,13), "Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith
   Christ hath made us free. Only use not your liberty for an occasion to
   the flesh, but by love serve one another."--(6:16), "And as many as
   walk according to this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon
   the Israel of God."--(Matt 11:25), "I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
   heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and
   prudent, and hast revealed them to babes."--(1 Cor 15:10), "I laboured
   more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God that was
   with me."--(Psa 36:11), "Let not the foot of pride come against me."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [380] This is here fitly put into the mouth of Nomista, vailing of
   legal principles and practices among professors being much owing to
   legal preaching; the success whereof is not to be won dered at, since
   it is rowing with the stream of nature.

THE MARROW OF MODERN DIVINITY.

PART SECOND.

   "We know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully," (1 Tim 1:8).
     __________________________________________________________________

   TO THE RIGHT HON.

JOHN WARNER,

   LORD MAYOR OF THE MOST RENOWNED CITY OF LONDON.

   E. F. wisheth a most plentiful increase of spiritual wisdom, and all
   necessary

   graces for the discharge of his duty, to the glory of God, and the good
   of his people.

   RIGHT HONOURABLE,

   The rod of God's judgments hath been now long upon us, which we by our

   manifold sins have procured, according as it is said concerning
   Jerusalem, (Jer

   4:18), "Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee."
   And have

   we any just ground to hope, that till the cause be taken away, the
   effect will

   cease? Can we expect that the Lord will turn away his judgments, till
   we turn

   away from our sins? And can we turn away from our sins before we know
   them?

   And can we come to know our sins any otherwise than by the law? Doth
   not one

   apostle say, that "sin is the transgression of the law"? (1 John 3:4).
   And doth not

   another apostle therefore say, that "by the law is the knowledge of
   sin"? (Rom

   3:20). Surely, then, a treatise, wherein is shown what is required, and
   what is

   forbidden, in every commandment of the law, and so consequently what is
   sin,

   must needs be for this cause, and at this time, very seasonable. But
   yet, alas! that

   although there be ever so many treatises written, or ever so many
   sermons

   preached upon this subject, yet do they either remain willfully
   ignorant of their

   sins, or else, though they know them, they will not forego them, but
   rather choose

   willfully to wallow on in the mire of iniquity, so sweet and dear are
   their sins unto

   them. But what, then, must they be suffered to go on without restraint?
   No; God

   forbid. Such persons as the law and love of God will not constrain,
   such must the

   execution of justice restrain; upon such must the penalty of the law of
   the land,

   being grounded upon God's laws, be by the civil magistrate inflicted.
   And for this

   cause it is that the king is required, "When he sitteth upon the throne
   of his

   kingdom, to write him a copy of the law of God in a book," (Deut
   17:18). And

   for this cause it is that the civil magistrate is called "the keeper of
   both tables"; for

   says Luther, on Galatians, p. 151, "God hath ordained magistrates, and
   other

   superiors, and appointed laws, bounds, and all civil ordinances, that
   if they can do

   no more, yet at least they may bind the devil's hands, that he rage not
   in his bond

   slaves after his own lusts." And hence it is that the apostle, speaking
   of the civil

   magistrate, says, "If thou do that which is evil, be afraid, for he
   beareth not the

   sword in vain," (Rom 13:4). Wherefore, Right Honourable, God having
   called

   you to wield the sword of authority in the most famous city of this
   kingdom, I, a

   poor inhabitant thereof, the author of the ensuing Dialogue, have,
   through the

   advice and persuasion of some godly ministers, and through the
   consideration of

   the suitableness of the subject with our place, been moved to take the
   boldness to

   offer this work to your worthy name and patronage; not that I do
   conceive your

   Honour is ignorant of your duty, nor yet that I see you to neglect your
   duty, for

   your Christian integrity in your place, and your zealous forwardness to
   reform

   things amiss, by punishing of evil doers, doth to me witness the
   contrary; but

   rather to encourage your Honour to continue your godly course in the
   ways of

   well-doing, and to advance forward in paths of piety, being more swift
   in your

   motion now towards the end of your race--your year I mean, that so your

   Master, Christ, may have cause to say concerning you, as he once did
   concerning

   the church of Thyatira, "I know thy works, and charity, and service,
   and faith,

   and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the
   first," (Rev

   2:19). Yea, and that it also may be said concerning you, "Well done,
   thou good

   and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
   make thee

   ruler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord," (Matt
   25:21).

   And so most humbly begging of your Honour that these my poor labours
   may be

   accepted, and that under your Honour's name, they may go forth into the
   world,

   and praying the Lord of power, and the God of all grace, to multiply
   his Spirit

   upon your Honour, with all the blessed fruits of the same, I take my
   leave, and

   rest your Honour's most humble servant to be commanded,

     __________________________________________________________________

THE AUTHOR TO THE WELL-AFFECTED READER.

   GOOD READER:

   I do confess there are so many godly and learned expositions upon the
   ten

   commandments already extant, that it may seem needless to add any more
   unto

   that number. Nevertheless, I pray thee, do not think it impossible but
   that God

   may, by such a weak instrument as I myself am, show his power in doing

   something more, touching this subject, than hath yet been done. I do
   confess, I

   have had good helps from the labours of others, and have made much use

   thereof, especially for matter, yet have I not confined my discourse
   within the

   compass of what I have found in other books, but have, from the warrant
   of the

   word of God, taken the boldness to enlarge it, both as touching the
   matter and

   manner, and especially touching the application, wherein I have
   endeavoured to

   give both believers and unbelievers their distinct proportion, by
   distinguishing

   betwixt the ten commandments, as they are the law of works, having the
   promise

   of eternal life, and the threatening of eternal death annexed to them,
   and so

   applying them to the unbeliever; and as they are the law of Christ,
   having the

   promise of eternal life, and the threatening of eternal death separated
   from them,

   and so applying them to the believer. I have not denied, but
   acknowledged, yea,

   and proved, that the law of the ten commandments, truly expounded, is
   to be a

   perpetual rule of life to all mankind, yea, to believers themselves;
   for though the

   Spirit of Jesus Christ do, according to his promise, write this law in
   their hearts, as

   their inward rule, yet, in regard that whilst they live in this world,
   it is done but in

   part, they have need of the ten commandments to be unto them as an
   outward

   rule: for though the Spirit have begotten in them a love to this law,
   and wrought in

   them a willing disposition to yield obedience thereunto, yet have they
   need of the

   law to be unto them as a glass, wherein they may see what the will of
   God is, and

   as a rule to direct them how to actuate their love and willingness, so
   that, as a

   precious godly minister of Jesus Christ truly says, the Spirit within,
   and the law

   without, "is a lamp unto their feet, and a light unto their path," (Psa
   119:105).

   But yet I do conceive, that expositors on the commandments should not
   only

   endeavour to drive on their designs to that end, and there terminate
   their

   endeavours, as if there were no further use to be made of the law,
   neither in

   believers nor in unbelievers; but they should aim at a further end--an
   end beyond

   this, especially in unbelievers, and that is to discover to them how
   far short they

   come of doing that which the law requireth, that so they may not take
   up their

   rest in themselves, but hasten out of themselves to Jesus Christ; and
   that

   believers, by beholding their own imperfections, should take occasion
   to humble

   themselves, and cleave the more close unto him by faith.

   For when, by way of exposition, it is only declared what is required,
   and what is

   forbidden in every commandment, with exhortations, motives, and means
   to do

   thereafter, it has been observed that divers both profane and mere
   civil honest

   people, upon the hearing or reading of the same, have concluded with
   themselves,

   that they must either alter their course of life, and strive and
   endeavour to do

   more than they have done, and better than they have done, or else they
   shall

   never be saved; and hereupon they have taken up a form of godliness, in
   hearing,

   reading, and praying, and the like, and so have become formal
   professors, and

   therein have rested, coming far short of Jesus Christ, yea, and
   believers

   themselves have sometimes taken occasion thereby, to conceive that they
   must

   do something towards their own justification and salvation.

   Wherefore I, yet not I by any power of my own, but by the grace of God
   that is

   with me, have endeavoured not only to show what is required, and what
   is

   forbidden in every commandment, but also that it is impossible for any
   man,

   whether he be an unbeliever or a believer, to keep any one commandment

   perfectly, yea, or to do any one action or duty perfectly, that so by
   the working of

   God's Spirit in the reading of the same, men may be moved; not only to
   turn from

   being profane, or mere civil honest men, to be formal professors, but
   that they

   may be driven out of all their own works and performances unto Jesus
   Christ,

   and so become Christians indeed, and that those who are Christians
   indeed, may

   thereby

   do I now resolve, by the help of God, very speedily to fall about that
   work; and I

   hope I shall then make it appear unto you that the ten commandments are
   but an

   epitome or an abridgment of the law of God, and that the full
   exposition thereof is

   to be found in the books of the prophets and apostles, called the Old
   and New

   Testament.

   Neo. Indeed, sir, I have told him that we must not stick upon the bare
   words of

   any of the ten commandments, nor rest satisfied with the bare literal
   sense, but

   labour to find out the full exposition and true spiritual meaning of
   every one of

   them, according to other places of Scripture.

   Evan. If you told him so, you told him that which is most true; for he
   that would

   truly understand and expound the commandments must do it according to
   these

   six rules.

   First, He must consider that every commandment has both a negative and

   affirmative part contained in it; that is to say, where any evil is
   forbidden, the

   contrary good is commanded; and where any good is commanded, the
   contrary

   evil is forbidden; for, says Ursinus' Catechism, page 329, "The
   lawgiver does in

   an affirmative commandment comprehend the negative; and contrariwise,
   in a

   negative he comprehends the affirmative."

   Secondly, He must consider that under one good action commanded, or one
   evil

   action forbidden, all of the same kind or nature are comprehended, yea,
   all

   occasions and means leading thereunto; according to the saying of
   judicious Virel,

   "The Lord minding to forbid divers evils of the same kind, he
   comprehendeth

   them under the name of the greatest."

   Thirdly, He must consider that the law of God is spiritual, reaching to
   the very

   heart or soul, and all the powers thereof, for it charges the
   understanding to know

   the will of God; it charges the memory to retain, and the will to
   choose the better,

   and to leave the worse; it charges the affections to love the things
   that are to be

   loved, and to hate the things that are to be hated, and so binds all
   the powers of

   the soul to obedience, as well as the words, thoughts, and gestures.

   Fourthly, He must consider, that the law of God must not only be the
   rule of our

   obedience, but it must also be the reason of it; we must not only do
   that which is

   there commanded, and avoid that which is there forbidden, but we must
   also do

   the good, because the Lord requires it, and avoid the evil, because the
   Lord

   forbids it; yea, and we must do all that is delivered and prescribed in
   the law, for

   the love we bear to God, the love of God must be the fountain, the
   impulsive, and

   efficient cause of all our obedience to the law.

   Fifthly, He must consider, that as our obedience to the law must arise
   from a

   right fountain, so must it be directed to a right end, and that is,
   that God alone

   may be glorified by us; for otherwise it is not the worship of God, but
   hypocrisy,

   says Ursinus' Catechism; so that according to the saying of another
   godly writer,

   the final cause or end of all our obedience must be, God's glory, (1
   Cor 10:13);

   or, which is all one, that we may please him, for in seeking to please
   God, we

   glorify him, and these two things are always co-incident.

   Sixthly, He must consider, that the Lord does not only take notice of
   what we do

   in obedience to this law, but also after what manner we do it; and
   therefore we

   must be careful to do all our actions after a right manner, viz:
   humbly, reverently,

   willingly, and zealously.

   Neo. I beseech you, sir, if you can spare so much time, let us have
   some brief

   exposition of some, if not all the ten commandments before we go hence,

   according to these rules.

   Evan. What say you, neighbour Nomologista, do you desire the same?

   Nom. Yea, sir, with all my heart, if you please.

   Evan. Well, then, although my occasions at this time might justly plead
   excuse for

   me; yet, seeing that you do both of you desire it, I will for the
   present dispense

   with all my other business, and endeavour to accomplish your desires,
   according

   as the Lord shall be pleased to enable me: and therefore, I pray you
   understand

   and consider, That in the first commandment there is a negative part
   expressed in

   these words: "Thou shalt have none other gods before my face." And an

   affirmative part included in these words: "But thou shalt have me only
   for thy

   God"; for if we must have none other for our God, it implies strongly,
   that we

   must have the Lord for our God.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, begin with the affirmative part, and first tell
   us what the

   Lord requireth of us in this commandment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   COMMANDMENT I

   Evan. In this first commandment, "The Lord requireth the duty of our
   hearts or

   souls," (Prov 23:26); that is to say, of our understandings, wills, and
   affections,

   and the effects of them.

   Neo. And what is the duty of our understandings?

   Evan. The duty of our understandings is to know God, (2 Chron 28:9).
   Now the

   end of knowledge is but the fullness of persuasion, even a settled
   belief, which is

   called faith, so that the duty of our understandings is, so to know
   God, as to

   believe him to be according as he has revealed himself to us in his
   word and

   works, (Heb 11:6).

   Neo. And how has the Lord revealed himself to us in his word?

   Evan. Why, he has revealed himself to be "most wise," (Rom 16:27);
   "most

   mighty," (Deut 7:21); "most true," (Deut 32:4); "most just," (Neh
   9:33); and

   "most merciful," (Psa 145:8).

   Neo. And how has he revealed himself to us in his works?

   Evan. He has revealed himself in his works to be "the Creator of all
   things," (Exo

   20:11); and "the Preserver of all things," (Psa 26:6); and "The
   Governor of all

   things," (Psa 135:6); and "the Giver of every good gift," (James 1:17).

   Neo. And how must our knowledge of God, and our belief in him, be
   expressed

   by their effects?

   Evan. We must express, that we know and believe God to be according as
   he has

   revealed himself in his word and works, by our remembering and
   acknowledging

   him whensoever there is occasion for us so to do.

   As, for example; when we read or hear those judgments that the Lord in
   his word

   has threatened to bring upon us for our sins, (Deut 28:16), we are to
   express that

   we do remember and acknowledge him to be most mighty, true, and just,
   by our

   fearing and trembling thereat, (Psa 119:120, Hab 3:16). And when we
   read or

   hear of blessings, that the Lord in his word has promised to bestow
   upon us for

   our obedience, (Deut 28:2), then we are to express, that we do remember
   and

   acknowledge him to be more true, and merciful, by our obedience unto
   him, and

   by our trusting in him, and relying upon him, (Gen 32:9). And when we
   behold

   the excellent frame of heaven and earth, and the creatures contained
   therein, then

   we are to express, that we do remember and acknowledge the Lord to be
   the

   Creator and Maker of them all, by our praising and magnifying his name,
   (Psa

   106:5, 139:14). And when the Lord does actually inflict any judgment
   upon us,

   then we are to express that we do remember and acknowledge him to be
   the

   Governor of all things, and most mighty, wise, and just, by humbling
   ourselves

   under his mighty hand, (1 Peter 5:6). And by judging ourselves worthy
   to be

   destroyed, for our iniquities, (Eze 36:31). And by bearing the
   punishment thereof,

   (Lev 36:41), with willing, patient, contented submission to his will
   and pleasure,

   (Psa 39:9). And when the Lord does actually bestow any blessing upon
   us, then

   we are to express, that we do remember, and acknowledge him to be the
   most

   merciful Giver of every good gift, by our humble acknowledging that we
   are

   unworthy of the least of his mercies, (Gen 32:10); and "in giving him
   thanks for

   all things," (1 Thess 5:18). And thus have I showed unto you what is
   the duty of

   our understandings.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, let us, in the next place, hear what is the duty
   of our wills.

   Evan. The duty of our wills is to choose the Lord alone for our
   portion, (Psa

   16:5, 119:57).

   Neo. And how must we express that we have chosen the Lord for our
   portion?

   Evan. "By our loving him with all our hearts, with all our souls, and
   with all our

   might," (Deut 5:6).

   Neo. And how must we express that we do thus love the Lord?

   Evan. We must express that we do thus love the Lord by the acting of
   our other

   affections, as by our desire of most near communion with him, (Phil
   1:23), and

   by our delighting most in him, (Psa 37:4); and by our rejoicing most in
   him, (Phil

   4:4); and by our fearing most to offend him, (Matt 10:28); and by our
   sorrowing

   most for offending him, (Luke 22:62); and by being most zealous against
   sin, and

   for the glory of God, (Rev 3:19). And thus have I showed you what the
   Lord

   requires in the affirmative part of this commandment.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, proceed to the negative part, and show us what
   the Lord

   forbids in this commandment.

   Evan. In this first commandment is forbidden, "ignorance of God," (Jer
   4:22); so

   also is unbelief, or doubting of the truth of God's word, (Isa 7:9).
   And so also is

   the want of fearing the threatenings of God, (Deut 28:58), and the
   fearing the

   threatenings of men, either more, or as much as the threatenings of
   God, (Isa

   51:12,13); and so also is the want of trusting unto or relying upon the
   promises of

   God, (Luke 12:29), and the trusting or relying upon ourselves, men's
   promises, or

   any other thing, either more, or as much as we do upon God, (Jer 17:5,
   Luke

   12:20). And so also is the want of acknowledging the hand of God, in
   the time of

   affliction, (Isa 26:11); and acknowledging that the rod can smite
   without the hand

   of God, (Job 19:11); and so also is the want of humbling ourselves
   before the

   Lord, (Dan 5:22); and pride of heart, (Prov 16:5). And so also is
   impatience and

   discontentedness under the chastising hand of God, (Exo 17:2); and not
   returning

   unto him that smiteth us, (Isa 9:13); and so also is our forgetfulness
   of God in not

   acknowledging his merciful and bountiful hand in reaching forth all
   good things

   unto us in the time of prosperity, (Psa 78:11, Deut 32:18); and so also
   is our

   sacrificing to our own nets, (Hab 1:16), in ascribing the coming in of
   our riches to

   our own care, pains, and diligence in our callings, (Deut 8:17); and so
   also is

   unthankfulness to the Lord for his mercies, (Rom 1:21); and so also is
   our want

   of love to God, (1 Cor 16:22); and our loving any creature either more
   than God,

   or equal with God, (Matt 10:37); and so also is our want of desiring
   his presence,

   (Job 21:14); and our desiring the presence of any creature either more
   or so much

   as God, (Prov 6:25); and so also is our want of rejoicing in God, (Deut
   28:47);

   and our rejoicing either more, or as much in anything as in God, (Luke
   10:20);

   and so also is our want of fearing to offend God, (Jer 5:22); and our
   fearing to

   offend any mortal man, either more or as much as to offend God, (Prov
   29:25);

   and so also is our want of sorrow and grief for offending God, (1 Cor
   5:2); and

   our sorrowing more, or as much, for any worldly loss or cross, as for
   our sinning

   against God, (1 Thess 4:15); and so also is our want of zeal, or our
   lukewarmness

   in the cause of God and his truth, (Rev 3:16); and our corrupt, blind,
   and

   indiscreet zeal, (Luke 9:55). And thus have I showed unto you what the
   Lord

   requires, and what he forbids in this commandment. And now, neighbour

   Nomologista, I pray you, tell me whether you think you keep it
   perfectly or no.

   Nom. Sir, before I tell you that, I pray you tell me how you prove that
   the Lord

   in this commandment requires all these duties, and forbids all these
   sins.

   Evan. First, I know that the Lord in this commandment requires all
   these duties,

   because no man can truly have the Lord for his God, except he have
   chosen him

   for his portion; and no man can truly choose the Lord for his portion,
   before he

   truly know him; and he that does truly know God, does truly believe
   both his

   threatenings and his promises; and he that does truly believe the
   Lord's

   threatenings, must needs fear and tremble at them; and he that does
   believe the

   Lord's promises, must needs truly love him, for faith always produces
   and brings

   forth love; and whosoever does truly love God, must needs desire near

   communion with him; yea, and rejoice in communion with him; yea, and
   fear to

   offend him; yea, and sorrow for offending him; yea, and be zealous for
   his glory.

   Secondly, I know that all these sins are forbidden in this commandment,
   because

   that whatsoever the mind, will, and affections of a man are set upon,
   or carried

   after, either more or as much as after God, that is another god unto
   him; and

   therefore, if a man stand in fear of any creature, or fear the loss of
   any creature,

   either more than God, or equal with God, he makes that creature his
   god: and if

   he trust unto, and put confidence in any creature, either more than
   God, or equal

   with God, that creature is his god; and hence it is that the covetous
   man is called

   an idolater, (Eph 5:5); for that he makes his god his hope, and says to
   the fine

   gold, "Thou art my confidence," (Job 31:24). And if any man be proud of
   any

   good thing he has, and do not acknowledge God to be the free giver and
   bestower

   of the same, or if he be impatient and discontented under the Lord's
   correcting

   hand, he makes himself a god; and if a man so love any creature as that
   he

   desires it being absent, or delights in it being present, either more
   than God, or

   equal with God, that creature is another god unto him. And hence it is,
   that

   voluptuous men are said to make their belly their god, (Phil 3:19). In
   a word,

   whatsoever the mind of man is carried after, or his heart and
   affections set upon,

   either more, or as much as upon God, that he makes his god. And
   therefore we

   may undoubtedly conclude, that all the sins before mentioned, are
   forbidden in

   this commandment.

   Nom. Then believe me, sir, I must confess that I come far short of
   keeping this

   commandment perfectly.

   Evan. Yea, and so we do all of us, I am confident; for has not every
   one of us

   sometimes questioned in our hearts, whether there be a God or no? and
   as

   touching the knowledge of God, may we not all three of us truly say
   with the

   apostle, (1 Cor 13:9), "We know in part"? And which of us has so feared
   and

   trembled at the threatenings of God, and at the shaking of his rod, as
   we ought?

   Nay, have we not feared the frowns, threats, and power of some mortal
   man

   more than the frowns, threats, and power of God? It is well if it have
   not

   appeared by our choosing to obey man rather than God: and which of us
   has so

   trusted unto, and relied upon the promises of God in time of need, as
   he ought?

   nay, have we not rather trusted unto and relied upon men and means,
   than upon

   God? Has it not been manifested by our fearing of poverty, and want of
   outward

   things, when friends, trading, and means begin to fail us; though God
   has said, "I

   will not fail thee, nor forsake thee"? (Heb 13:5). And which of us has
   so humbled

   ourselves under the chastening and correcting hand of God as we ought:
   nay,

   have we not rather expressed abundance of pride, by our impatience and

   discontentedness, and want of submitting to the will of God; and by our

   quarrelling and contending with his rod? And which of us has so
   acknowledged

   God in the time of prosperity, and been so thankful unto him for his
   blessings, as

   we ought? Nay, have we not rather at such times forgotten God, and
   sacrificed to

   our own nets, saying in our hearts, if not also with our mouths, "I may
   thank

   mine own diligence, care, and pains-taking, or else it had not been
   with me as it

   is"? And which of us hath so manifested our love to God, by our desire
   of near

   communion with him in his ordinances, and by our desire to be dissolved
   and to

   be with him, as we ought? Nay, have we not rather expressed our great
   want of

   love to him, by our backwardness to prayer, reading, and hearing his
   word, and

   receiving the sacrament, and by our little delight therein, and by our
   unwillingness

   to die? Nay, have we not manifested our greater love to the world, by
   our greater

   desires after the profits, pleasures, and honours of the world, and by
   our greater

   delight therein than in God? Or which of us have so manifested our love
   to God,

   by our sorrow and grief for offending him, as we ought? Nay, have we
   not rather

   manifested our greater love to the world, by our sorrowing and grieving
   more for

   some worldly loss or cross, than for offending God by our sins? Or
   which of us

   have so manifested our love to God, by being so zealous for his glory
   as we

   ought? Nay, have we not rather expressed greater love to ourselves, in
   being more

   hot and fiery in our own cause than in God's cause? And thus have I
   endeavoured

   to satisfy your desires concerning the first commandment.

   Neo. I beseech you, sir, proceed to do the like concerning the second

   commandment, and first tell us how the first and second commandments
   differ

   the one from the other.
     __________________________________________________________________

   COMMANDMENT II.

   Evan. Why, as the first commandment teaches us to have the true God for
   our

   God, and none other; so the second commandment requireth that we
   worship this

   true God alone, with true worship: and in this commandment likewise,
   there is a

   negative part expressed in these words, "Thou shalt not make to thyself
   any

   graven image," &c. And an affirmative part included in these words,
   "But thou

   shalt worship me only and purely, according to my will, revealed in my
   word."

   Neo. I pray you then, sir, begin with the affirmative part, and tell us
   what be the

   means of God's worship, prescribed in his word.

   Evan. If we look into the word of God, we shall find that the ordinary
   means and

   parts of God's worship, are invocations upon the name of God, ministry
   and

   hearing of the word of God, administration and receiving the
   sacraments, with all

   helps and furtherances to the right performance of the same.

   But to declare this more particularly, First of all, prayer both public
   and private is

   required in God's word, as you may see, (1 Tim 2:8, Acts 2:21,22, Dan
   6:10).

   Secondly, Reading the word, or hearing it read, both publicly and
   privately, is

   required in God's word, as you may see, (Rev 1:3, Deut 5:6). Thirdly,
   Preaching,

   and hearing of the word preached, is required in the word of God, as
   you may

   see, (2 Kings 4:2, 1 Thess 2:13). Fourthly, The administration and
   receiving the

   sacrament is required in the word of God, as you may see, (Matt 3:6,
   26:26, 1

   Cor 10:16). Fifthly, Praising of God, in singing of psalms, both
   publicly and

   privately, is required in the word of God, as you may see, (Col 3:16,
   James 5:13).

   Sixthly, Meditation on the word of God is required in the word of God,
   as you

   may see, (Psa 1:2, Acts 17:11). Seventhly, Conference about the word of
   God is

   required in the word of God, as you may see, (Mal 3:16). And, Lastly,
   For the

   better fitting and stirring us up to the right performance of these
   duties, religious

   fasting, both in public and in private, is required in the word of God,
   as you may

   see, (Joel 1:14, 2:15). And so also is a religious vow or free promise
   made to

   God, to perform some outward work, or bodily exercise for some end, as
   you

   may see, (Eccl 5:3,4). And thus have I shown you what be the means of
   God's

   worship which he hast prescribed in his word.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, then proceed to the negative part, and tell us
   what the Lord

   forbiddeth in this commandment.

   Evan. Well then, I pray you understand, that in this commandment is
   forbidden,

   neglecting of prayer, as you may see, (Psa 14:4). And so also is
   absenting

   ourselves from the hearing of the word preached, or any other ordinance
   of God,

   when the Lord calls us thereunto, as you may see, (Luke 14:18-20). And
   so also

   is our rejecting the sacrament of baptism, as you may see, (Luke 7:30).
   And so

   also is our slighting the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as you may
   see, (2 Chron

   30:10). And so also is the slighting and omitting any of the other
   forenamed

   duties, as you may see, (Psa 10:4, John 3:31, Isa 22:12-14). And so
   also is

   praying to saints and angels, as you may see, (Isa 63:16, Rev 19:10).
   And so also

   is the making of images for religious uses, as you may see, (Lev 19:4).
   And so

   also is the representing God by an image, as you may see, (Exo 32:8,9).
   And so

   also are all carnal imaginations of God in his worship, as you may see,
   (Acts

   17:29). And so also is all will worship, or the worshipping of God
   according to our

   own fancy, as you may see, (1 Sam 9:10,13, Col 2:23). And thus have I
   shown

   unto you both what the Lord requireth, and what he forbiddeth in this

   commandment, and now, neighbour Nomologista, I pray you, tell me
   whether

   you keep it perfectly or no.

   Nom. Yea, sir, I am persuaded that I go very near it. But, I pray you,
   sir, tell me

   how you prove that all these duties are required, and all these sins
   forbidden in

   this commandment?

   Evan. For the proof of this, I pray you consider, that the worshipping
   of false

   gods is flatly forbidden in the negative part of this commandment, in
   these words,

   "Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve, nor worship them,"
   (Exo

   20:5). And the worshipping of the true God is implied and expressed in
   these

   words, (Matt 4:10), "Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
   shalt

   thou serve."

   Nom. But sir, how do you prove that these duties which you have named
   are

   parts of God's worship?

   Evan. For answer hereunto, I pray you consider, that to worship God, is
   to tender

   up that homage and respect that is due from a creature to a Creator;
   now, in

   prayer we are said to tender up this homage unto him, and to manifest
   our

   profession of dependence upon him for all the good we have, and
   acknowledge

   him to be the Author of all good; and indeed prayer is such a great
   part of God's

   worship, that sometimes, in Scripture, it is put for the whole worship
   of God. "He

   that calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved," (Rom 10:13); that
   is, he that

   worships God aright: (Jer 10:25), "pour out thy wrath upon the heathen
   that know

   thee not, and on the families that call not upon thy name," that do not
   pray, that

   do not worship God.

   And that hearing the word is a part of God's worship is manifest;
   because that in

   hearing we do manifest our dependence upon God, for knowing his mind,
   and the

   way to eternal life, every time we come to hear the word of God, if we
   know

   what we do, we do thus much, we profess that we depend upon the Lord
   God for

   the knowing of his mind, and the way and rule to eternal life; and
   besides, herein

   we also come to wait upon God in the way of ordinance, to have that
   good

   conveyed unto us by way of an ordinance, beyond what the thing itself
   is able to

   do, and therefore this is worship. And that the receiving the sacrament
   is a part of

   God's worship, is manifest, in that when we come to receive these holy
   signs and

   seals, we come to present ourselves before God, and come to God for a
   blessing,

   in communicating unto us some higher good than possibly those creatures
   that we

   have to deal with, are able of themselves to convey to us; we come to
   God to

   have communion with him, and that we might have the blessing of the
   covenant

   of grace conveyed unto us through these things: and therefore when we
   come to

   be exercised in them, we come to worship God. The like we might say of
   the rest

   of the duties before mentioned, but I hope this may suffice to satisfy
   you that

   they are parts of God's worship.

   Nom. But, sir, you know that in this commandment there is nothing
   expressly

   forbidden but the making and worshipping of images, and therefore I
   question

   whether all those other sins that you have named be likewise forbidden.

   Evan. But thou must know, that when the Lord condemneth the chief, or
   greatest

   and most evident kind of false worship, namely, the worship of God at,
   or by

   images, it is manifest that he forbids also the other kinds of false
   worship, seeing

   this is the head and fountain of all the rest; wherefore, whatsoever
   worships are

   instituted by men or do any way hinder God's true worship, they are
   contrary to

   this commandment.

   Nom. Well, sir, though that these things be so, yet for all that, I am
   persuaded I

   go very near the keeping of this commandment; for I do constantly
   perform the

   most of these duties, and am not guilty of doing the contrary.

   Evan. But thou must know, that for the worshipping of God aright, it is
   not only

   required that we do the good which he commands, and avoid the evil
   which he

   forbids, but also, that we do it in obedience to God, to show that we
   acknowledge

   him alone to be the true God, who has willed this worship to be thus
   done unto

   him; so that, as I told you before, the word of God must not only be
   the rule of

   our actions, but also the reason of them: we must do all things which
   are delivered

   and prescribed in the ten commandments, even for the love we bear to
   God, and

   for the desire we have to worship him: for except we so do them, we do
   them not

   according to the sentence and prescript of the law, neither do we
   please God

   therein. Wherefore though you have prayed and heard the word of God,
   and

   received the sacrament, and done all the rest of the forenamed duties,
   yea, and

   though you have not done the contrary, yet if all this has been either
   because the

   laws of the kingdom require it, or in mere obedience to any superior,
   or to gain

   the praise and esteem of men, or if you have any way made yourself your
   highest

   end, you have not obeyed nor worshipped God therein; for, says a
   judicious

   writer, "If any man shall observe these things in mere obedience to the
   king's

   laws, or thereby to please holy men, and not through an immediate
   reverence of

   that heavenly Majesty who has commanded them, that man's obedience is

   non-obedience; his keeping these laws is no keeping them"; because the
   main

   thing here intended is neglected, which is the setting up God in his
   heart; and that

   which is most of all abhorred is practised, viz: the "fear of God
   taught by the

   precepts of men," (Isa 29:13). And to this purpose that worthy man of
   God has

   this saying, "Take heed, says he, that the praises of men be not the
   highest end

   that thou aimest at; for if it be, thou worshippest men, thou dost make
   the praise

   of men to be thy god; for whatsoever thou dost lift up in the highest
   place, that is

   thy god, whatsoever it be; wherefore, if thou liftest up the praise of
   men, and

   makest that thy end, thou makest that thy god, and so thou art a
   worshipper of

   men, but not a worshipper of God." [Mayer's Catechism.]

   Again, says he, "Take heed of making self thy end. That is, take heed
   of aiming

   at thine own peace, and satisfying thine own conscience in the
   performance of

   duties." It is true, says he, when we perform duties of God's worship,
   we may be

   encouraged thereunto by the expectations of good to ourselves, yet we
   must look

   higher, we must look at the honour and praise of God; it is not enough
   to do it

   merely to satisfy conscience; thy main end must be, that thou mayest,
   by the

   performance of the duty, be fitted to honour the name of God, otherwise
   we do

   them not for God but for ourselves, which the Lord condemns, (Zech
   7:5,6). And

   now, neighbour Nomologista, I pray you, let me ask you once again,
   whether you

   think you keep this commandment perfectly or no.

   Nom. No, believe me, sir, I do now begin to fear I do not.

   Evan. If you make any question of it, I would entreat you to consider
   with

   yourself, whether you have not gone to the church on the Lord's day to
   hear the

   word of God, and to receive the sacrament, and do other duties, because
   the laws

   of the kingdom require it, or because your parents or masters have
   required it, or

   because it is a custom to do so, or, because you conceive it to be a
   credit for you

   to do so. And I pray you also to consider, whether you have not
   abstained from

   worshipping of images, and other such idolatrous and superstitious
   actions which

   the Papists use, merely because the laws of the land wherein you live
   do

   condemn such things. And I pray you also consider whether you have not
   been

   sometimes zealous in prayer in the presence and company of others, to
   gain their

   praise and approbation; have you not desired that they should think you
   to be a

   man of good gifts and parts? And have you not in that regard
   endeavoured to

   enlarge yourself? And have you not sometimes performed duties merely
   because

   otherwise conscience would not let you be quiet? And have you not
   sometimes

   fasted and prayed, and humbled yourself, merely or chiefly in hopes
   that the Lord

   would, for your so doing, prevent or remove some judgment from you, or
   grant

   you some good thing which you desire? Now, I beseech you, answer me
   truly

   and plainly, whether you do not think you have done so.

   Nom. Yea, believe me, sir, I think I have.

   Evan. Then have you in all these things honoured and worshipped your
   parents,

   your masters, your magistrates, your neighbours, your friends, and
   yourself, as so

   many false gods, instead of the true God; and therein have been guilty
   of a breach

   of the second commandment.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, proceed to speak of the third commandment, as you
   have

   done of the first and second; and first, tell us how the second and
   third

   commandments differ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Marrow of Modern Divinity - Part Second

   COMMANDMENT III.

   Evan. Why, as the Lord in the second commandment doth require that we

   worship him alone by true means, so does he in the third commandment
   require

   that we use the means of his worship after a right manner, that so they
   may not

   be used in vain, (Matt 15:9). And in this commandment likewise, there
   is a

   negative part expressed in these words, "Thou shalt not take the name
   of the Lord

   thy God in vain." And that is, thou shalt not profane it, by using my
   titles,

   attributes, ordinances, works, ignorantly, irreverently, or after a
   formal,

   superstitious manner. And an affirmative part, included in these words,
   "But thou

   shalt sanctify my name," (Isa 8:13); by using my titles, attributes,
   ordinances,

   works, and religion, with knowledge, reverence, and after a spiritual
   manner,

   (John 4:24).

   Neo. I pray you, sir, begin with the affirmative part, and first tell
   us what the

   Lord requires in this commandment.

   Evan. The Lord in this commandment doth require, that we sanctify his
   name in

   our hearts, with our tongues, and in our lives, by thinking,
   conceiving, speaking,

   writing, and walking, so as becomes the excellency of his titles,
   attributes,

   ordinances, works, and religion.

   Neo. And how are we to sanctify the name of the Lord in regard to his
   titles?

   Evan. By thinking, conceiving, speaking, and writing holily,
   reverently, and

   spiritually of his titles, Lord and God, (Deut 28:58). And this we do
   when we

   meditate on them, and use them in our speeches and writings with an
   inward

   spiritual fear and trembling, to the glory of God and good of men, (Jer
   5:22).

   Neo. And how are we to sanctify the name of the Lord, in regard of his

   attributes?

   Evan. By thinking, conceiving, speaking, and writing holily,
   reverently, and

   spiritually of his power, wisdom, justice, mercy, and patience, (Psa
   104:1,

   103:6,8). And this we do when we think, speak, and write of them after
   a careful,

   reverent, and spiritual manner, and apply them to such good uses for
   which the

   Lord has made them known, (Psa 37:30).

   Neo. And in which of God's ordinances are we to sanctify his name?

   Evan. In every one of his ordinances, and especially in the three great
   ordinances,

   prayer, preaching, and hearing the word, and administering and
   receiving the

   sacraments.

   Neo. And how are we to sanctify the name of the Lord in prayer?

   Evan. In prayer we are to sanctify the name of the Lord in our hearts,
   and with

   our tongues, in calling upon his name after a holy, reverent, and
   spiritual manner;

   and this we do when our prayers are the speech of our souls, and not of
   our

   mouths only; and that is, when in prayer we lift up our hearts unto
   God, (Psa

   25:1); and pour them out unto him, (Psa 62:8); and when we pray with
   spirit, and

   with understanding also, (1 Cor 14:15); and with humility, (Gen 18:27,
   32:10,

   Luke 18:13); and with fervency of spirit, (James 5:16); and out of a
   sense of our

   own wants, (James 1:5) and with a special faith in the promises of God,
   (Matt

   21:22).

   Neo. And how are you ministers to sanctify the name of the Lord in
   preaching his

   word?

   Evan. We are to sanctify the name of the Lord in our hearts, and with
   our

   tongues, in preaching after a holy, reverent, and spiritual manner; and
   this we do

   when the word is preached, not only outwardly, by the body, but also
   inwardly

   with the heart and soul: when the heart and soul preaches, then is the
   ministry of

   the word, on the minister's part, used after an holy and spiritual
   manner, and that

   is, when we preach in demonstration of the Spirit, (1 Cor 2:4); and in
   sincerity, (2

   Cor 2:17); and faithfully without respect of persons, (Deut 33:9); and
   with

   judgment and discretion, (Matt 24:49); and with authority and power,
   (Matt

   7:29); and with zeal to God's glory, (John 7:18); and with a desire of
   the people's

   salvation, (2 Cor 11:2).

   Neo. And how are we hearers to sanctify the name of the Lord in hearing
   his

   word?

   Evan. In hearing it after an holy, reverent, and spiritual manner; and
   this you do

   when your heart and soul hears the word of God; and that is when you
   set

   yourselves in the presence of God, (Acts 10:33); and when you look upon
   the

   minister as God's messenger or ambassador, (2 Cor 5:20), and so hear
   the word

   as the word of God, and not as the word of man, (1 Thess 2:13); with
   reverence

   and fear, (Isa 66:2); and with a ready desire to learn, (Acts 17:11);
   and with

   attention, (Acts 8:6); and with alacrity, without wearisomeness or
   sleepiness,

   (Acts 20:9).

   Neo. And how are you ministers to sanctify the name of the Lord in
   administering

   the sacraments?

   Evan. By administering them after an holy, reverent, and spiritual
   manner; and

   that is, when we administer them with our hearts or souls, according to
   Christ's

   institution, (Matt 26:26); to the faithful in profession at least, (1
   Cor 10:16); and

   with a hearty desire that may become profitable to the receivers.

   Neo. And how are we to sanctify the name of the Lord in receiving the

   sacraments?

   Evan. This we do when we rightly and seriously examine ourselves
   aforehand, (1

   Cor 11); and rightly and seriously mind and consider of the sacramental
   union of

   the sign, and the thing signified, and do in our hearts perform those
   inward actions

   which are signified by the outward actions. (Acts 8:37,38, 1 Cor 10:6)

   Neo. And how are we to sanctify the name of the Lord in regard of his
   works?

   Evan. In thinking and speaking of them after a wise, reverent, and
   spiritual

   manner; and this we do when we meditate and make mention, in our
   speeches

   and writings, of the inward works of God's eternal election and
   reprobation, with

   wonderful admiration of the unsearchable depths thereof, (Rom
   11:33,34); and

   when we meditate in our hearts of the works of God's creation and

   administration, and make mention of them in our words and writings, so
   as that

   we acknowledge therein his wisdom, power, and goodness, (Rom 1:19,20,
   Psa

   19:1); and acknowledging the workmanship of God therein, do speak
   honourably

   of the same, (Psa 139:14, Gen 1:31).

   Neo. And how are we to sanctify the name of the Lord in regard of his
   religion?

   Evan. By holy profession of his true religion, and a conversation
   answerable

   thereunto, to the glory of God, the good of ourselves and others, (Matt
   5:16, 1

   Peter 2:12).

   Neo. And, sir, are we not also to sanctify the name of God by swearing
   thereby?

   Evan. Yea, indeed, that was well remembered; we are to sanctify the
   name of the

   Lord in our hearts, and with our tongues in swearing thereby, after a
   holy,

   religious, and spiritual manner; and this we do when the magistrate
   requires an

   oath of us by the order of justice, that is, not against piety or
   charity, (Gen 43:3, 1

   Sam 24:21,22); and when we swear in truth, (Jer 4:2); that is, when we
   are

   persuaded in our conscience the thing we swear is truth, and swear
   simply and

   plainly, without fraud or deceit, (Psa 15:4, 24:4); and when we swear
   in

   judgment, that is, when we swear with deliberation, well considering
   both the

   nature and greatness of an oath, viz: that God is thereby called to
   witness the

   truth, and judge and punish us if we swear falsely, (Gal 1:20, 2 Cor
   1:23); and

   when we swear in righteousness, that is, when the thing we swear is
   lawful and

   just, and when our swearing is, that God may be glorified, (Josh 7:19);
   our

   neighbour satisfied, controversies ended, (Heb 6:16); our own innocency
   cleared,

   (Exo 22:11); and our duty discharged, (1 Kings 8:31).

   Neo. Well, sir, now I pray you, proceed to the negative part, and tell
   us what the

   Lord forbiddeth in this commandment.

   Evan. As the Lord in the affirmative part of this commandment doth
   require that

   we sanctify his name in our hearts, with our tongues, and in our lives,
   by thinking,

   conceiving, speaking, writing, and walking, so as becomes the
   excellency of his

   titles, attributes, ordinances, and religion; so doth he in the
   negative part thereof

   forbid the profanation of his name, by doing the contrary.

   Neo. Well then, sir, I pray you first tell us how the titles of God are
   profanely

   abused.

   Evan. They are profanely abused divers ways; as first, by thinking
   irreverently of

   them, or using them in our common talk, or in our writings, after a
   rash, careless

   and irreverent manner, (Psa 50:22, Rom 1:21); as when in foolish
   admiration we

   say, Good God! Good Lord! Lord have mercy on us, what a thing is this?
   and the

   like; or when by the way of idle wishes or imprecations we say, "The
   Lord be my

   judge!" (Gen 16:5); or, I pray God I may never stir, if such a thing be
   not so, and

   the like; or when by way of vain swearing, we mingle our speeches, and
   fill up

   our sentences with needless oaths, as, Not so, by my faith! and the
   like, (Matt

   5:34, James 5:12); or when by way of jesting, or after a formal manner
   we say,

   God be thanked, God speed, God's name be praised, and the like, (2 Sam
   23:21).

   Neo. And I pray you, sir, how are the attributes of God profanely
   abused?

   Evan. The attribute of God's power is profanely abused, either by
   calling it into

   question, (2 Kings 7:2), or by thinking, speaking, or writing of it
   carnally,

   carelessly, or contemptuously, (Psa 12:4, Exo 5:2). And the attribute
   of God's

   providence is abused either by murmuring thereat in our hearts, (Deut
   15:9), or

   by speaking grudgingly against it under the name of fortune or chance,
   in saying,

   What a misfortune was this! What a mischance was that! and the like.
   (Deut 1:27,

   1 Sam 6:9) And the attribute of God's justice is profanely abused,
   either by

   thinking or saying, that God likes sin or wicked sinners, (Psa 50:21,
   Mal 3:15).

   And the attribute of God's mercy is profanely abused, either in
   presuming to sin,

   upon hopes that God will be merciful, or by speaking basely and
   contemptuously

   thereof, as when we say, speaking of some trifling thing, It is not
   worth

   God-a-mercy. And the attribute of God's patience is profanely abused by
   thinking

   or saying upon occasion of his forbearance to punish for a time, that
   he will

   neither call us to an account, nor punish us for our sins. (Rom 2:4)

   Neo. Now, sir, I pray you proceed to show how God's name is profanely
   abused

   in his ordinances; and first of all begin with prayer.

   Evan. God's name is profanely abused in prayer, either by praying
   ignorantly,

   without the true knowledge of God and his will, (Acts 17:23, Matt
   20:22); or

   when we pray with the mouth only, and not with the desires of our
   hearts

   agreeing with our words, (Hosea 3:14, Psa 78:36); and when we pray
   drowsily

   and heavily without fervency of spirit, (Matt 26:41); and when we pray
   with

   wandering worldly thoughts, (Rom 12:12); and when we pray with any
   conceit of

   our own worthiness, (Luke 18:9,11); and when we pray without faith in
   the

   promises of God, (James 1:6).

   Neo. And how is God's name profanely abused in hearing or reading his
   word?

   Evan. God's name is hereby abused, when we hear it or read it, and do
   not

   understand it, (Acts 8:30); and when we hear it only with the outward
   ears of our

   bodies, and not also with the inward ears of our heart and soul; and
   this we do

   when we read it or hear it with our hearts full of wandering thoughts,
   (Eze 33:30);

   and we read it, or hear it with dull, drowsy, and sleepy spirits; and
   when in

   hearing of it we rather conceive it to be the word of a mortal man that
   delivers it;

   than the word of the great God of heaven and earth, (1 Thess 2:13); and
   when

   we do not with our hearts believe every part and portion of that word
   which we

   read or hear, (Heb 4:2); and when we do not humbly and heartily subject

   ourselves to what we read or hear, (2 Kings 22:19, Isa 62:2).

   Neo. And how is the Lord's name profanely abused in receiving the
   sacrament of

   the Lord's supper?

   Evan. This we do when we either through want of knowledge cannot
   examine

   ourselves, or through our own negligence do not examine ourselves,
   before we eat

   of that bread, and drink of that cup, (1 Cor 11:28); and when we, in
   the act of

   receiving, do not mind the spiritual signification of the sacrament,
   but do either

   terminate our thoughts in the elements themselves, or else suffer them
   to rove and

   run out to some other object, (Luke 22:19); and when, after receiving,
   we do not

   examine ourselves what communion we have had with Christ in that
   ordinance,

   nor what virtue we have found flowing out from Christ into our own
   souls, by

   means of that ordinance, (2 Cor 13:5).

   Neo. And how is the name of the Lord profanely abused in taking of an
   oath?

   Evan. This we do, when we call the Lord to be a witness of vain and
   frivolous

   things, by our usual swearing in our common talk, (Hosea 4:2, Jer
   23:10); and

   when we call God to be a witness of our furious anger and wicked
   purpose, as

   when we swear we will be revenged on such a man, and the like, (1 Sam
   14:39,

   25:34); and when we call God to be a witness to our swearing falsely,
   (Lev 19:12,

   Zech 5:4); and when we swear by the mass, or by our faith, or troth, or
   by the

   rood, or by anything else that is not God, (Jer 5:7, Matt 5:34-37).

   Neo. And how is the name of God profanely abused as touching his works?

   Evan. When we either take no notice of his works at all, or when we
   think and

   speak otherwise of them than we have warrant from his word to do; as
   when we

   do not speak of the inward works of God's election and reprobation, and
   are

   called thereunto, and when we murmur and cavil thereat, (Rom 9:20); and
   when

   we either do not at all mind the works of his creation and
   administration, or do

   not take occasion thereby to glorify the name of God, (Psa 19:1, Rom
   1:21).

   Neo. And how is the name of God profanely abused in respect of his
   religion?

   Evan. When our conversation is not agreeable to our profession, (2 Tim
   3:5); and

   that either when in respect of God it is but hypocrisy, or in respect
   of men we

   walk offensively; for if we live scandalously in the profession of
   religion, we

   cause the name of God to be profaned by them that are without, (Rom
   2:24), and

   become stumbling blocks to our weak brethren, (Rom 14:13).

   And now, neighbour Nomologista, I pray you, tell me whether you think
   you

   keep this commandment perfectly or no.

   Nom. Sir, to tell you the truth, I had not thought that the name of God
   had

   signified any more than his titles, Lord and God.

   Evan. Aye, but you are to know that the name of God in Scripture
   signifies all

   those things that are affirmed of God, or any thing whatsoever it is,
   whereby the

   Lord makes himself known to men.

   Nom. Then believe me, sir, I have come far short of keeping this
   commandment

   perfectly, and so does every man else, I am persuaded.

   Evan. I am of your mind, for where is the man that hath and doth so
   meditate on

   God's titles, and use them in his speeches and writings, with such
   reverence, fear

   and trembling, as he ought? Or what man is he that can truly say, he
   never in all

   his life thought on them, or used them in his common talk, either
   rashly,

   carelessly, or irreverently? I am sure, for my own part, I cannot say
   so; for, alas!

   in the time of mine ignorance, I used many times to say, by way of
   foolish

   admiration, Good Lord! Good God! Lord have mercy on me, what a things
   is

   this? Yea, and I also many times used to say, I pray God I may never
   stir if such

   a thing be not so! Yea, and I have divers times said, The Lord be with
   you, and

   speed you! and, The Lord's name be praised! after a formal cursory
   manner, my

   thoughts being exercised about something else all the while.

   And where is the man that has always thought, conceived, spoken, and
   written so

   holily, reverently, and spiritually, of the Lord's power, wisdom,
   justice, mercy,

   and patience, as he ought? Nay, what man is he that can truly say, he
   never in all

   his life called the attribute of the Lord's power into question, nor
   ever murmured

   at any act or passage of God's providence, nor ever presumed to sin,
   upon hopes

   that God would be merciful unto him? I am sure I cannot truly say so.

   And where can we find the man that can truly say, he has always read
   and heard

   the word of God after a holy, reverent, and spiritual manner? Nay,
   where is the

   man that has not sometimes both heard it and read it after a formal,
   cursory, and

   unprofitable manner? Is there any man that can truly say he has always
   perfectly

   understood whatsoever he has read and heard--and that has not sometimes
   heard

   more with the outward ears of his body, than with the inward ears of
   his heart

   and soul--and that was never dull and drowsy, if not sleepy, in the
   time of

   hearing and reading--and that had never a worldly, nor wandering
   thought to

   come in at that time--and that never had the least doubting or
   questioning the

   truth of what he had read or heard? I am sure, for my own part, I have
   been

   faulty many of these ways.

   And is it possible to find a man that can truly say, he has always
   called upon the

   name of the Lord after a holy, reverent, and spiritual manner, or has
   not rather

   many times prayed after a carnal, unholy, or sinful manner? Where is
   the man

   that has always had a perfect knowledge of God and of his will in
   prayer, and

   whose heart has always gone along with his words in prayer, and that
   never was

   drowsy nor heavy, never had wandering thoughts in prayer, and that
   never had

   the least conceit that God would grant him anything for his prayer's
   sake, and that

   never had the least doubting or question in his heart, whether God
   would grant

   him the thing he asked in prayer. I am sure, for my own part, I can
   scarce clear

   myself from any of these.

   And can any man truly say he has always received the sacrament after a
   holy,

   reverent, and spiritual manner? Nay, has not every man rather cause to

   acknowledge the contrary? Is there a man to be found that has always
   seriously

   and rightly examined himself beforehand, and that has always, rightly,
   with his

   heart, performed all those inward actions that are signified by the
   outward; or has

   not every man and woman rather cause to confess, that either for want
   of

   knowledge, or through their own negligence, they have not so examined

   themselves as they ought, nor so actuated their faith, nor minded the
   spiritual

   signification of the outward elements, in the time of receiving the
   sacrament as

   they ought, nor so examined themselves, after receiving, what benefit
   they have

   got to their soul thereby? I am sure I have cause to confess all this.

   And where shall we find a man that has always sanctified the name of
   the Lord in

   his heart, and with his tongue, by swearing after a holy, religious,
   and spiritual

   manner; or rather, have not most men that have been called to take an
   oath,

   profaned the name of the Lord, either by swearing ignorantly, falsely,
   maliciously,

   or from some base and wicked end? And I think it is somewhat hard to
   find a

   man that never in all his life did swear, either by his faith, or by
   his troth, by the

   mass, or by the rood. I am sure I am not the man; and he is a rare man
   that can

   truly say, he has always sanctified the name of God in his heart, and
   with his

   tongue, by admiring and acknowledging the wisdom, power, and goodness
   of God

   manifested in his works, for it is to be feared that most men do either
   take no

   notice at all of the works of God, or else do think and speak of them
   otherwise

   than the word of God warrants them to do. I am sure I am one of these
   most.

   And he is a precious man that has always so sanctified the name of the
   Lord, by a

   holy and unblamable conversation as he ought; for, alas! many
   professors of

   religion, by their fruitless and offensive walking, do either cause the
   enemies of

   God to speak evil of the way of God, or else do thereby cause their
   weak brother

   to stumble: it is well if I never did so: and thus have I also
   endeavoured to satisfy

   your desires concerning the third commandment.

   Neo. I beseech you, sir, proceed to speak of the fourth commandment as
   you

   have done of the other three.
     __________________________________________________________________

   COMMANDMENT IV.

   Evan. Well, then, I pray you consider, that as the Lord in the third
   commandment

   doth prescribe the right manner how he will be worshipped, so doth he
   in the

   fourth commandment, set down the time when he will be most solemnly

   worshipped, after the right manner; and in this commandment there is an

   affirmative part, expressed in these words, "Remember the Sabbath day
   to keep it

   holy," &c.: that is, remember that the seventh day in every week be set
   apart

   from worldly things and business, and be consecrated to God by holy and

   heavenly employments; and a negative part, expressed also in these
   words, "In it

   thou shalt not do any work," &c. That is, thou shalt not on that day do
   any such

   thing or work as doth any way hinder thee from keeping an holy rest
   unto God.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, begin with the affirmative part, and first tell
   us what the

   Lord requires of us in this commandment.

   Evan. In this fourth commandment the Lord requires that we finish all
   our works

   in the space of six days, (Deut 5:13), and think on the seventh day
   before it

   come, and prepare for it, (Luke 23:54), and rise early on that day in
   the morning,

   (Psa 92:2, Mark 1:35,38,39). Yea, and the Lord requires that we fit
   ourselves for

   the public exercises by prayer, reading, and meditation, (Eccl 5:1, Isa
   7:10); and

   that we join with the minister and people publicly assembled, with
   assent of mind,

   and fervency of affection in prayer, (Acts 2:42); in hearing the word
   read and

   preached, (Acts 13:14,15,44); in singing of Psalms, (1 Cor 14:15,16,
   Col 3:16); in

   the sacrament of baptism, (Luke 1:58,59); and in the sacrament of the
   Lord's

   Supper, so often as it shall be administered in that congregation
   whereof we are

   members, (1 Cor 11:26).

   Then afterwards, when we come home, the Lord requires that we seriously

   meditate on that portion of the word of which we have heard, (Acts
   17:11), and

   repeat it to our families, (Deut 6:7), and confer of it with others, if
   there be

   occasion, (Luke 24:14,17); and that we crave his blessing when we have
   done all

   this, (John 17:17).

   Neo. And is this all that the Lord requires us to do on that day?

   Evan. No; the Lord also requires that we do works of mercy on that day,
   as to

   visit the sick, and do them what good we can, (Neh 8:12, Mark 3:3-5),
   and

   relieve the poor and needy, and such as be in prison, (Luke 13:16), and
   labour to

   reconcile those that be at variance and discord, (Matt 5:9).

   And the Lord doth permit us to do works of instant necessity on that
   day, as to

   travel to places of God's worship, (2 Kings 4:23); to heal the
   diseased, (Hosea

   6:6, Matt 12:7,12); to dress food for the necessary preservation of our
   temporal

   lives, (Exo 1:1); to tend and feed cattle, (Matt 12:11); and such like.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, proceed to the negative part, and tell us what
   the Lord

   forbiddeth in this commandment.

   Evan. In this commandment the Lord forbiddeth idleness or sleeping more
   on the

   Lord's day in the morning, than is of necessity, (Matt 20:6); and he
   also

   forbiddeth us to labour in our particular callings, (Exo 16:28-30); and
   he also

   forbiddeth us to talk about our worldly affairs and business on that
   day, (Amos

   8:5, Isa 58:13); and he also forbiddeth us to travel any journey about
   our worldly

   business on that day, (Matt 24:20); or keep any fairs or markest on
   that day,

   (Neh 13:16,17); or to labour in seed time and harvest on that day. In a
   word, the

   Lord on that day forbiddeth all worldly works and labours, except works
   of

   mercy and instant necessity, which were mentioned before. And thus have
   I also

   declared, both what the Lord requires and what he forbids in the fourth

   commandment. And now, neighbour Nomologista, I pray you tell me,
   whether

   you think you keep it perfectly or no.

   Nom. Indeed, sir, I must confess, there is more both required and
   forbidden in

   this commandment than I was aware of; but yet I hope I go very near the

   observing and doing of all.

   Neo. But, sir, is the bare observing and doing of these things
   sufficient for

   keeping of this commandment perfectly?

   Evan. Oh no! the first commandment must be understood in all the rest,
   that is,

   the obedience to the first commandment must be the motive and final
   cause of

   our obedience to the rest of the commandments, otherwise it is not the
   worship of

   God, but hypocrisy, as I touched before; wherefore, neighbour
   Nomologista,

   though you have done all the duties the Lord requires in this
   commandment, and

   avoided all the sins which he forbids, yet, if all this has been from
   such grounds,

   and to such ends, as I told you of in the conclusion of the second
   commandment,

   and not for the love you bear to God, and the desire you have to please
   him, you

   come short of keeping this commandment perfectly.

   Neo. Sir, whatsoever he does, I am sure I come far short not only in
   this point,

   but in divers others; for though it is true, indeed, I am careful to
   finish all my

   worldly business in the space of six days, yet, alas! I do not so
   seriously think on

   and prepare for the seventh day as I ought; neither do I many times
   rise so early

   on that day as I ought; neither do I so thoroughly fit and prepare
   myself by prayer

   and other exercises beforehand as I ought; neither do I so heartily
   join with the

   minister and people, when I come to the assembly, as I ought, but am
   subject to

   many wandering worldly thoughts and cares even at that time. And when I
   come

   home, if I do either meditate, repeat, pray, or confer, yet, alas! I do
   none of these

   with such delight or comfort as I ought; neither have I been so mindful
   nor careful

   to visit the sick, and relieve the poor, as I ought: neither can I
   clear myself from

   being guilty of doing more worldly works or labours on that day, than
   the works

   of mercy and instant necessity. The Lord be merciful unto me! I pray
   you, sir,

   proceed to speak of the fifth commandment, as you have done of the
   rest. But

   first of all, I pray, tell us what is meant by father and mother.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Marrow of Modern Divinity - Part Second

   COMMANDMENT V.

   Evan. By father and mother is meant, not only natural parents, but
   others also

   that are our superiors, either in age, in place, or in gifts, (2 Kings
   5:13, 6:21,

   13:14).

   Neo. And why did the Lord use the name of father and mother to signify
   and

   comprehend all other superiors?

   Evan. Because the government of fathers is the first and most ancient
   of all

   others; and because the society of father and mother is that from whom
   all other

   societies do come.

   Neo. And are the duties of inferiors towards their superiors only here
   intended?

   Evan. No, but also of superiors towards their inferiors, and of equals
   amongst

   themselves; so that the general duty required in the affirmative part
   of this fifth

   commandment, "Honour thy father and thy mother," &c., is, that every
   man,

   woman, and child, be careful to carry themselves as becomes them in
   regard to

   that order God hath appointed amongst men, and that relation they have
   to

   others, either as inferior, superior, or equal.

   Neo. I pray you, sir, proceed to the particular handling of these
   things; and first

   tell us what is the duty of children towards their parents.

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment doth require, that children do

   reverence their parents, by thinking and esteeming highly of them, (Gen
   31:35);

   and by loving them dearly, (Gen 46:29); and by fearing them in regard
   of their

   authority over them, (Lev 19:3). And this inward reverent esteem of
   them is to be

   expressed by their outward reverent behaviour towards them, (Gen
   48:12). And

   this outward reverent behaviour is to be expressed in giving them
   reverent titles,

   (Gen 31:35), and by bowing their bodies before them, (1 Kings 2:19),
   and by

   embracing their instructions, (Prov 1:8), and by submitting patiently
   to their

   corrections, (Heb 12:9), and by their succouring and relieving of them
   in case of

   want and necessity, (Gen 47:12), and by making their prayers unto God
   for them,

   (1 Tim 2:12).

   Neo. And, sir, what be the duties of parents towards their children?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment does require, that parents be
   careful

   to bring their children, with all convenient speed, in due order, to be
   admitted into

   the visible church of God by baptism, (Luke 1:59); and that they,
   according to

   their ability, do yield and give unto their children such competent
   food, clothing,

   and other necessaries, as are fit for them, (Matt 7:9,12, 1 Tim 5:8).

   And that they train them up in learning, instruct them in religion, and
   endeavour

   to sow the seeds of godliness in their hearts, so soon as they be able
   to speak, and

   have the use of reason and understanding, (Deut 4:10, 6:7,20,21). And
   that they

   be careful to check and rebuke them when they do amiss, (Prov 31:2);
   and that

   they be careful seasonably to correct their faults, (Prov 13:24,
   19:18); and that

   they be careful in time to train them in some honest calling, (Gen
   4:2); and that

   they be careful to bestow them in marriage in due time, (Jer 29:6, 1
   Cor 7:36,38);

   and that they be careful to lay up something for them, as their ability
   will suffer,

   (Prov 19:14, 2 Cor 12:14); and that they be earnest with God in prayer,
   for a

   blessing upon their children's souls and bodies, (Gen 48:15,16).

   Neo. And what be the duties of servants towards their masters?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment doth require, that servants
   have an

   inward, high, and reverent esteem of their masters, (Eph 6:5- 7); yea,
   and that

   they have in their hearts a reverent awe and fear of them, (1 Peter
   2:18); and this

   reverence and fear they are to express by their outward reverent
   behaviour

   towards them, both in word and deed, as by giving them reverent titles,
   (2 Kings

   5:23,25), and by an humble, submissive countenance and carriage, either
   when

   their masters speak to them, or they speak to their masters, (Gen 24:9,
   Acts

   10:7); and by yielding of sincere, faithful, willing, painful, and
   single- hearted

   service to their masters in all they go about, (Col 3:22, Titus 2:10);
   and by a meek

   and patient bearing of those checks, rebukes, and corrections which are
   given to

   them, or laid upon them by their masters, without grudging stomach, or
   sullen

   countenance, though the master do it without just cause, or exceed in
   the

   measure, (1 Peter 2:18,20); and by being careful to maintain their
   master's good

   name, in keeping secret those honest intents which he would not have
   disclosed;

   and, as much as may be, to hide and cover their master's wants and
   infirmities,

   not blazing them abroad, (2 Sam 15:13, 2 Kings 6:11).

   Neo. And what is the duty of masters towards their servants?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment doth require, that masters be
   careful

   to choose unto themselves religious servants, (Psa 101:6); and that
   they do

   instruct them in religion and the ways of godliness, (Gen 18:19); and
   that they be

   careful to bring them to the public exercises, (Josh 24:15); and that
   they do daily

   pray with them and for them, (Jer 10:24); and that they do yield and
   give unto

   them meat, drink, and apparel fitting for them, (Deut 24:14,15); and
   that they see

   to them that they follow the works of their callings with diligence,
   (Prov 31:27);

   and that they be careful to instruct them, and give them direction
   therein, (Exo

   35:34); and that they be careful to give them just reproof and
   correction for their

   faults, (Prov 29:29, 19:29); and that they look carefully unto them
   when they are

   sick, (Matt 8:5,6).

   Neo. And what is the duty of wives towards their husbands?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment doth require, that wives do
   carry in

   their hearts an inward opinion and esteem for their husbands, (Eph
   5:33); the

   which they are to express in their speeches, by giving them reverent
   titles and

   terms, (1 Peter 3:6); and in their countenance and behaviour, by their
   modesty,

   shamefacedness, and sobriety, (1 Tim 2:9); and in being willing to
   yield

   themselves to be commanded, governed and directed by their husbands in
   all

   things honest and lawful, (Gen 31:4,16,17, 2 Kings 4:22); and they are
   also

   required to love their husbands, (Titus 2:4), and to express their love
   by their

   chastity and faithfulness to their husbands, both in body and mind,
   (Titus 2:5, 1

   Tim 3:11); and by their using the best means they can to keep their
   husbands'

   bodies in health, (Gen 27:9). They are also required to be helpful to
   them in the

   government of the family, and to be provident for their estate, by
   exercising

   themselves in some profitable employment, (Prov 31:13,15,19); and they
   are also

   required to stir up their husbands to good duties, and join with them
   in the

   performance of them, (2 Kings 4:9,10); and to pray for them, (1 Tim
   2:12).

   Neo. And what is the duty of husbands towards their wives?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment requires that husbands be
   careful to

   choose religious wives, (2 Cor 6:14); and that they dwell with them as
   men of

   knowledge, (1 Peter 3:7); and that they cleave unto them with true love
   and

   affection of heart, (Col 3:19); yea, and that they content themselves
   only with the

   love of their own wives, and keep themselves only to them both in mind
   and

   body, (Prov 5:19,20); they are also to be careful to maintain their
   authority over

   them, (Eph 5:23); and to live cheerfully and familiarly with them,
   (Prov 5:19);

   and to be careful to provide all things needful and fitting for their
   maintenance, (1

   Tim 5:8); and to teach, instruct, and admonish them, as touching the
   best things,

   (1 Sam 1:8); and to pray with them and for them, (1 Peter 3:7); and to
   endeavour

   to reform and amend what they see amiss in them, by seasonable and
   loving

   admonition and reproof, (Gen 30:2); and wisely and patiently to bear
   with their

   natural infirmities, (Gal 6:2).

   Neo. And what is the duty of subjects towards their magistrates?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment doth require, that subjects do
   think

   and esteem reverently of their magistrates, (2 Sam 10:16,17); and that
   they carry

   in their hearts a reverent awe and fear of them, (Prov 24:21); the
   which they are

   to express by their outward reverent behaviour towards them, both in
   word and

   deed, (2 Sam 9:6,8); and by an humble, ready, and willing submitting of

   themselves to their commands, either to do, or to suffer, (1 Peter
   2:13); and by

   yielding a loyal and sound-hearted love to them, in not shrinking from
   them when

   they have need, but defending them with their goods, bodies, and lives,
   if

   occasion require, (2 Sam 18:3, 21:27); also they are required to make
   their

   prayers unto God for them, (1 Tim 2:12).

   Neo. And what is the duty of magistrates towards their subjects?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment doth require, that magistrates
   be

   careful to establish good laws in their kingdoms, and good orders among
   their

   subjects, (2 Kings 18:4, Rom 12:17); and that they be careful to see
   them duly

   and impartially executed, (Jer 38:4,6, Rom 13:3,4); and that they be
   careful to

   provide for the peace, safety, quietness, and outward welfare of their
   subjects,

   (Rom 13:4, 1 Tim 2:2), and not to oppress them with taxations and
   grievances, (1

   Kings 12:14).

   Neo. And what duties are people to perform towards their minister?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment doth require, that the people
   have

   their minister in reverent account and estimation, (1 Cor 4:1); and
   that they

   humbly and willingly yield themselves to be taught and directed in
   their spiritual

   affairs by him, (Heb 13:17); and that they pray for him, that the Lord
   would

   enable him to do his duty, (Rom 15:30,31); and that they do their best
   to defend

   him against the wrongs of wicked men, (Rom 16:4); and that they yield
   unto him

   double honour, that is, both singular love for their work's sake, and
   sufficient

   maintenance, both in regard of his person and calling, (1 Tim 5:17,18,
   Gal 4:15).

   Neo. And what is the duty of a minister towards the people?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment doth require, that ministers do

   diligently and faithfully preach the pure word of God unto their
   people, both in

   season and out of season, (1 Cor 9:16, 2 Kings 4:2); and that they do
   so truly and

   plainly expound the same, that the people may understand it, and that
   they pour

   out their souls to God in prayer, for the spiritual good of the people,
   (1 Thess

   1:2); and they go before the people, as a pattern of imitation to them,
   in all

   holiness of conversation, (Phil 4:9).

   Neo. And what is the duty of equals?

   Evan. Why, the Lord in this commandment doth require, that equals
   regard the

   dignity and worth of each other, and carry themselves modestly one
   towards

   another, and in giving honour to one before another, (Eph 5:21, Rom
   12:10). And

   thus having showed you the duties required in this commandment, I pray
   you,

   Nomologista, tell me whether you think you have kept it perfectly or
   no.

   Nom. Sir, though I have not kept it perfectly, yet I am persuaded I
   have gone

   very near it; for when I was a child, I loved and reverenced my
   parents, and was

   obedient unto them; and when I was a servant, I reverenced and feared
   my

   master, and did him faithful service; and since I became a man, I have,
   I hope,

   carried myself well towards my wife, and towards my servants; yea, and
   done my

   duty both to magistrates and ministers.

   Evan. Aye, but I must tell you, the Lord doth not only require you to
   do them,

   but also that you do them in obedience unto him; that is, in conscience
   to God's

   commandment, or for his sake, even because he requires it. Therefore,
   although

   you did your duty to your parents, when you were a child, and to your
   master

   when you were a servant, yet if you did it either for the praise of
   men, or for fear

   of their corrections, or to procure a greater portion, or greater
   wages, and not

   because the Lord says, (Eph 6:4), "Children, obey your parents in the
   Lord"; and

   because he says to servants, "Whatsoever you do, do it heartily, as to
   the Lord,

   and not unto men," you have not in so doing kept this commandment; and
   though

   you have loved your wife, and every way carried yourself well towards
   her, yet if

   it have been either because she is come of rich parents, or because she
   is

   beautiful, or because she brought you a good portion, or because she
   some way

   serves and pleases you after the flesh, and not because the Lord says,
   (Eph 5:25),

   "Husbands, love your wives"; you have not therein kept this
   commandment: and

   though you have carried yourself ever so well towards your servants,
   yet if it

   have been that they might praise you, or to make them follow your
   business more

   diligently and faithfully, and not because the Lord says, "Masters,
   give unto your

   servants that which is just and equal," you have not therein kept this

   commandment: and though you have done your duty ever so well towards
   your

   magistrate, yet if it has been for fear of his wrath, and not for
   conscience sake,

   viz: because the Lord says, "Let every soul be subject unto the higher
   powers,"

   you have not therein kept this commandment: and though you have given
   your

   minister his due maintenance, and invited him often to your table, and
   carried

   yourself ever so well towards him, yet if it have been that he or
   others might think

   you a good Christian, and a kind man, and not because the Lord says,
   (Gal 6:6),

   "Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that
   teacheth, in all

   good things," you have not therein kept this commandment.

   Neo. Well, sir, I cannot tell what my neighbour Nomologista hath done,
   but for

   mine own part, I am sure, I have come far short of doing my duty in any
   relation

   I have had to others; for when I was a child, I remember that I was
   many times

   stubborn and disobedient to my parents, and vexed if I might not have
   my will,

   and slighted their admonitions, and was impatient at their corrections,
   and

   sometimes despised and contemned them in my heart, because of some
   infirmity,

   especially when they grew old; neither did I pray for them, as it seems
   I ought to

   have done; and the truth is, if I did yield any obedience to them at
   all, it was for

   fear of their corrections, or some such by-respects, and not for
   conscience

   towards God. And when I was a servant, I did not think so reverently,
   nor esteem

   so highly of my master and mistress as I should have done, but was apt
   to slight

   and despise them, and did not yield such humble, reverent, and cheerful

   obedience as I should have done; neither did I patiently and
   contentedly bear their

   checks and rebukes, but had divers times risings and swellings in my
   heart against

   them; neither was I so careful to maintain their good name and credit
   as I ought to

   have been; neither did I pray unto the Lord for them as I ought to have
   done; and

   the very truth is, all the obedience and subjection which I yielded
   unto them, was

   for fear of their reproofs and corrections, or for the praise of men,
   rather than in

   conscience to the Lord's commandment.

   And when I entered into the married estate, I was not careful to choose
   a religious

   wife; no, I aimed at beauty more than piety; and I have not dwelt with
   my wife as

   a man of knowledge; no, I have expressed much ignorance and folly in my

   carriage towards her; neither have I loved her so as a husband ought to
   love his

   wife, for though it be true I have had much fond affection towards her,
   yet I have

   had but little true affection, as it hath been evident in that I have
   been easily

   provoked to anger and wrath against her, and have not carried myself
   patiently

   towards her; neither have I been careful to maintain mine authority
   over her, but

   have lost it by my childish and indiscreet carriage towards her;
   neither have I lived

   so cheerfully and delightfully with her as I ought to have done, but
   very heavily,

   discontentedly, and uncomfortably have I carried myself towards her;
   neither

   have I been careful to instruct and admonish her as I ought; and though
   I have

   now and then reproved her, yet for the most part it has been in a
   passion, and not

   with the spirit of meekness, pity, and compassion; neither have I
   prayed for her

   either so often or so fervently as I ought; and whatsoever I have done,
   that has

   been well done, I have been moved thereunto, in former times
   especially, rather

   by something in her, or done by her, than by the commandment of God.
   And

   since I became a father and a master, I have neither done my duty to my
   children

   nor servants as I ought, for I have not had such care, nor taken such
   pains for

   their eternal good, as I have done for their temporal. I have had more
   care, and

   taken more pains to provide food and raiment for them, than I have to
   admonish,

   instruct, teach, and catechize them; and if I have reproved or
   corrected them, it

   has been rather because they have some way offended me, than because
   they

   have offended God; and truly, I have neither prayed for them so often,
   nor so

   fervently as I ought. In a word, whatsoever I have done by way of
   discharging

   my duty to them, I fear me, it has been rather out of natural
   affection, or to avoid

   the blame, and gain the good opinion of men, than out of conscience to
   the Lord's

   will and commandment.

   And if I have at any time carried myself well, or done my duty either
   to

   magistrate or minister, it has rather been for fear or praise of men,
   than for

   conscience sake towards God; so far have I been from keeping this

   commandment perfectly: the Lord be merciful unto me!

   Evan. Assure yourself, neighbour Neophytus, this is not your case
   alone, but the

   case of every man that has stood in all these relations to others, as
   it seems you

   have done, as I am confident any man that truly knows his heart will
   confess,

   yea, and any woman that is well acquainted with her own heart, I am
   persuaded,

   will confess, that she has not had such a reverent esteem and opinion
   of her

   husband as she ought, nor so willingly yielded herself to be commanded,

   governed, and directed by him as she ought, nor loved him so truly as
   she ought;

   nor been so helpful to him any way as she ought, nor prayed either so
   oft or so

   fervently for him as she ought; and I fear me, most women do all that
   they do

   rather for fear of their husband's frowns, or to gain his favour, than
   for

   conscience to the Lord's will and command.

   And where is the magistrate that is so careful to establish in his
   dominions such

   good and wholesome laws as he ought, or to see them executed or put in
   practice

   as he ought, or that is so careful to uphold and maintain the truth of
   religion as he

   ought, or that is so careful to provide for the peace, safety, and
   welfare of his

   people as he ought? Or where is the magistrate that does not do what he
   does for

   some other cause, or some other end, rather than because God commands
   them,

   or to the end he may please him?

   And where is the minister that does his duty so in his place as he
   ought? I am

   sure, for mine own part, I have neither so diligently nor faithfully
   preached the

   pure word of God as I ought; nor so fully nor truly expounded it and
   applied it to

   my hearers as I ought; nor so poured out my soul to God for them in
   prayer as I

   ought; neither have I gone before them as a pattern of imitation in
   holiness of life

   and conversation, as I ought: the Lord be merciful to me!

   Neo. Well, sir, now I entreat you to proceed to speak of the sixth
   commandment

   as you have done of the rest.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Marrow of Modern Divinity - Part Second

   COMMANDMENT VI.

   Evan. Well, then, I pray you consider, that in the sixth commandment
   there is a

   negative part expressed in these words: "Thou shalt do no murder." That
   is, thou

   shalt neither in heart, tongue, nor hand, impeach or hurt either the
   life of thine

   own soul or body, or the life of any other man's soul or body; and an
   affirmative

   part included in these words: "But thou shalt every way, by all good
   means, seek

   to preserve them both."

   Neo. I pray you, sir, speak of these things in order, and first tell us
   what is

   forbidden in this commandment, as tending to the murdering of our own
   souls.

   Evan. That we may not be guilty of the murdering of our own souls, in
   this

   commandment is forbidden all sinning against God, (Prov 6:2); and so
   also is the

   careless neglecting and willful rejecting of the means that God has
   ordained to

   salvation, (Heb 2:3).

   Neo. And what is forbidden in this commandment, as tending to the
   murdering of

   other's souls?

   Evan. That we may not be guilty of murdering the souls of others, in
   this

   commandment is forbidden all giving occasions to others to sin against
   God, either

   by provoking of them, (1 Kings 21:25), or by counselling of them, (2
   Sam 16:21),

   or by evil example, (Rom 14:15).

   Neo. And what is forbidden in this commandment, as tending to the
   murdering of

   our own bodies?

   Evan. That we may not be guilty of murdering our own bodies, in this

   commandment is forbidden excessive worldly sorrow, (1 Cor 7:10, Prov
   17:22);

   and so also is the neglect of meat, drink, apparel, recreation, physic,
   or any such

   refreshments, (Eccl 5:19, 6:2); and so also is excessive eating and
   drinking, (Prov

   23:29,30, Hosea 7:5); and so also is laying violent hands upon
   ourselves, (1 Sam

   3:14, Acts 16:28).

   Neo. Well, sir, now I pray you, tell us what is forbidden in this
   commandment as

   tending to the murdering of others' bodies; and, first, what is
   forbidden in respect

   of the heart?

   Evan. That we may not be guilty of murdering others with our hearts, in
   this

   commandment is forbidden all hasty, rash, and unjust anger, (Matt
   5:22); and so

   also is malice or hatred, (Lev 19:18, 1 John 3:15); and so also is
   envy, (Psa 37:1,

   Prov 24:1); and so also is desire of revenge, (Lev 19:18).

   Neo. And what is forbidden in respect of the tongue?

   Evan. That we may not be guilty of murdering others with our tongues,
   in this

   commandment are forbidden all bitter and provoking terms, (Eph 4:31);
   and so

   also are all wrangling and contentious speeches, (Prov 15:1); and so
   also is crying

   and unseemly lifting up of the voice, (Eph 4:31); and so also is
   railing or scolding,

   (Prov 17:19, 1 Peter 3:19); and so also are all reviling and
   threatening speeches,

   (Matt 5:22); and so also are all mocking, scoffing, and deriding
   speeches, (2 Kings

   2:23, John 19:3).

   Neo. And what is forbidden in respect of the whole body, and more
   especially of

   the hand?

   Evan. That we may not be guilty of murdering others with our hands, in
   respect

   of the other parts of the body, in this commandment is forbidden all
   disdainful,

   proud, and scornful carriage, (Gen 4:5, Prov 6:17); and so also are all
   provoking

   gestures, as nodding of the head, gnashing with the teeth, and the
   like, (Matt

   27:39, Acts 7:45); and so also is all froward and churlish behaviour,
   (1 Sam

   25:17); and so also is brawling and quarrelling, (Titus 3:2). And more
   especially in

   respect of the hand is forbidden striking and wounding, (Exo 21:18,22);
   and so

   also is all taking away of life, otherwise than in case of public
   justice, just war,

   and necessary defence, (Exo 21:12, Gen 9:6).

   Neo. I pray you, sir, proceed to the affirmative part of this
   commandment, and

   first tell us what is required of us in respect of the life of our own
   souls.

   Evan. In respect of the preservation of the life of our own souls is
   required a

   careful avoiding of all sorts of sin, (Prov 11:19); and so also is a
   careful use of all

   means of grace, and spiritual life in our souls, (1 Peter 2:2).

   Neo. And what is required of us in respect of the preservation of the
   life of

   others' souls?

   Evan. In respect of the preservation of the life of the souls of
   others, is required,

   that according to our place and calling, and as present occasion is
   offered, we

   teach and instruct others to know God and his will, (Gen 18:19, Deut
   6:7); and so

   also that we do our best to comfort others that are in distress of
   conscience, (1

   Thess 5:14), and that we pray for the welfare and comfort of others'
   souls, (Gen

   43:29); and that we give others good examples by our Christian-like
   walking,

   (Matt 5:16).

   Neo. And what is required of us in respect of the preservation of the
   life of our

   own bodies?

   Evan. In respect of the preservation of the life of our own bodies, is
   required in

   this commandment, that we be careful to procure unto ourselves the use
   of

   wholesome food, clothing, and lodging, and physic, when there is
   occasion, (1

   Tim 5:23, Eccl 10:17, 2 Kings 20:7); and also that we use honest and
   lawful

   mirth, rejoicing in an holy manner, (Prov 17:22, Eccl 3:4).

   Neo. And what is required of us in respect of the preservation of the
   life of the

   bodies of others?

   Evan. In respect of the preservation of the life of the bodies of
   others, in this

   commandment is required a kind and loving disposition, with tenderness
   of heart

   towards them, (Eph 4:31,32): and so also is a patient bearing of wrongs
   and

   injuries, (Col 3:12,13); and so also is the taking of all things in the
   best sense, (1

   Cor 13:5,7); and so also is the avoiding of all occasions of strife,
   and parting with

   our own right sometimes for peace sake, (Gen 13:8,9); and so also are
   all such

   looks and gestures of the body as do express meekness and kindness,
   (Gen

   33:10), and so also is the relieving the poor and needy, (Job 31:16);
   and so also is

   the visiting of the sick, (Matt 25:36). And now, neighbour Nomologista,
   I pray

   you tell me, whether you think you keep this commandment perfectly or
   no.

   Nom. No, indeed, sir, I do not think I keep it perfectly, nor any man
   else, as you

   have expounded it.

   Evan. Assure yourself, neighbour Nomologista, that I have expounded it

   according to the mind and will of God revealed in his word, for you see
   I have

   proved all by Scripture: I told you at the beginning, that the law is
   spiritual and

   binds the very heart and soul to obedience; and that under one vice
   expressly

   forbidden, all of the same kind, with all occasions and means leading
   thereunto,

   are likewise forbidden; and according to these rules have I expounded
   it.

   Wherefore, I pray you, consider, that so many sins as you have
   committed, and

   so many times as you have carelessly neglected, and willfully rejected
   the means

   of salvation, so many wounds you have given your own soul.

   And so many times as you have given occasion to others to sin, so many
   wounds

   you have given to their souls.

   And so many fits of worldly sorrow as you have had, and so many times
   as you

   have neglected the moderate use either of meat, drink, apparel,
   recreation, or

   physic, when need hath required, so many wounds have you given your own

   body.

   And so many times as you have been either unadvisedly angry with any,
   or have

   borne any malice or hatred towards any, or have secretly in your heart
   wished

   evil unto any, or borne envy in your heart towards any, or desired to
   be revenged

   upon any, then have you been guilty of murdering them in your heart.
   And if you

   have given others any wrangling and contentious speeches, or any
   reviling and

   threatening speeches, or have carried yourself frowardly and churlishly
   towards

   others, and have not borne injuries and wrongs patiently, and expressed
   pity and

   compassion towards others, then have you been guilty of murdering them
   with

   your tongue. And if you have quarrelled with any man, or stricken or
   wounded

   any man, then have you murdered them with your hand, though you have
   not

   taken away their lives. And thus have I endeavoured to satisfy your
   desires

   concerning the sixth commandment.

   Neo. I beseech you, sir, proceed to speak of the seventh commandment as
   you

   have done of the rest.
     __________________________________________________________________

COMMANDMENT VII.

   Evan. Well, then, I pray you, consider that in the seventh commandment
   there is

   a negative part expressed in these words, "Thou shalt not commit
   adultery"; that

   is, though shalt not think, will, speak, or do anything whereby thine
   own chastity

   or the chastity of others, may be hurt or hindered. And an affirmative
   part

   included in these words, "But thou shalt every way, and by all good
   means,

   preserve and keep the same."

   Neo. I pray you, sir, begin with the negative part, and first tell us
   what is that

   inward uncleanness that is forbidden in this commandment.

   Evan. That we may not be guilty of the inward uncleanness of the heart,
   in this

   commandment are forbidden all filthy imaginations, unchaste thoughts,
   and

   inward desires and motions of the heart to uncleanness, (Matt 5:28, Col
   3:5); with

   all causes and occasions of stirring up and nourishing of these in the
   heart.

   Neo. And what are the causes and occasions of stirring up and
   nourishing these

   things in the heart which we are to avoid?

   Evan. That we may not stir up and nourish inward uncleanness in our
   hearts, is

   forbidden in this commandment gluttony, or excess in eating and
   pampering of the

   belly with meats, (Jer 5:8); and so also is drunkenness, or excess in
   drinking,

   (Prov 23:30,31,33); and so also is idleness, (2 Sam 11:12); and so also
   is the

   wearing of lascivious, garish, and new fangled attire, (Prov 7:10, 1
   Tim 2:9); and

   so also is keeping company with lascivious, wanton, and fleshly
   persons, (Gen

   39:10); and so also is immodest, unchaste, and filthy speaking, (Eph
   4:29); and so

   also is idle and curious looking of men on women, or women on men, (Gen
   6:2,

   39:7); and so also is the beholding of love matters, and light
   behaviour of men and

   women represented in stage plays, (Eze 23:14, Eph 5:3,4); and so also
   is

   immoderate and wanton dancing of men and women together, (Job 21:11,12,

   Mark 6:21,22); and so also is wanton kissing and embracing, with all
   unchaste

   touching and dalliance, (Prov 7:13).

   Neo. And what is that outward actual uncleanness which is forbidden in
   this

   commandment?

   Evan. The actual uncleanness forbidden in this commandment is
   fornication,

   which is a fleshly defilement of the body, committed between man and
   woman,

   being both of them single and unmarried persons, (1 Cor 10:8); and so
   also is

   adultery, which is a defilement of the body, committed between man and
   woman,

   being either one or both of them married persons, or at least
   contracted, (1 Cor

   6:9,18, Hosea 13:4).

   Neo. I pray you, sir, proceed to the affirmative part, and tell us what
   the Lord

   requires in this commandment.

   Evan. The Lord in this commandment requires purity of heart, (1 Thess
   4:5); and

   he also requires speeches savouring of sobriety and chastity, (Col 4:6,
   Gen 4:1);

   and he also requires that we keep our eyes from beholding vanity and
   lustful

   objects, (Psa 119:37, Job 31:1); and he also requires that we be
   temperate in our

   diet, in our sleep, and in our recreations, (Luke 21:34); and he also
   requires that

   we possess our vessels in holiness and honour, (1 Thess 4:9); and if we
   have not

   the gift of chastity, he requires that we take the benefit of holy
   marriage, (1 Cor

   7:29); and that the man and wife do in that estate render due
   benevolence each

   towards the other, (1 Cor 7:5). Thus have I also endeavoured to satisfy
   your

   desires concerning the seventh commandment; and now, neighbour
   Nomologista,

   I pray you tell me whether you think you keep it perfectly or no.

   Nom. Sir, I thank the Lord I am free from actual uncleanness, so that I
   am

   neither fornicator nor adulterer.

   Evan. Well, but though you be free from the outward act, yet if you
   have had in

   your heart filthy imaginations, unchaste thoughts, or inward desires,
   or motions of

   the heart to uncleanness, you have notwithstanding transgressed this

   commandment; or if you have been guilty of gluttony, or drunkenness, or

   idleness, or delight to keep company with lascivious and wanton
   persons, or have

   with your tongue uttered any unchaste or corrupt communication, or have
   been a

   frequenter of stage plays, or have used immoderate dancing with women,
   or have

   used wanton dalliance with kissing and embracing, then have you broken
   this

   commandment.

   Neo. I beseech you, sir, proceed to speak of the eighth commandment, as
   you

   have done of the rest.
     __________________________________________________________________

COMMANDMENT VIII.

   Evan. Well, then, I pray you consider, that in the eighth commandment
   there is a

   negative part expressed in these words, "Thou shalt not steal"; that
   is, though

   shalt by no unlawful way or means hurt or hinder the wealth and outward
   estate

   either of thyself or others: and an affirmative part included in these
   words, "But

   thou shalt by all good means preserve and further them both."

   Neo. I pray you, sir, begin with the negative part, and first tell us
   what is

   forbidden in this commandment, as a hurt or hindrance of our own
   outward

   estate.

   Evan. That we may not hurt or hinder our own outward estate, in this

   commandment are forbidden idleness, sloth, and inordinate walking,
   (Prov 18:9, 2

   Thess 3:11); and so also are unthriftiness and carelessness, either in
   spending our

   goods, or in ordering our affairs and businesses, (Prov 21:17, 1 Tim
   5:8); and so

   also is unadvised suretyship, (Prov 11:15).

   Neo. And what is forbidden in this commandment, as tending to the hurt
   or

   hindrance of our neighbour's estate?

   Evan. That we may not hurt or hinder our neighbour's outward estate, in
   this

   commandment is forbidden covetousness and discontentedness with our
   estate,

   (Heb 13:5); and so also is enviousness at the prosperity of others,
   (Prov 24:1);

   and so also are resolutions or hastening to be rich, as it were,
   whether the Lord

   afforded means or not, (1 Tim 6:9, Prov 28:20); and so also is
   borrowing and not

   paying again, we being able, (Psa 37:21); and so also is lending upon
   usury, (Exo

   22:25); and so also is the not restoring of things borrowed, (Psa
   37:21); and so

   also is cruelty in requiring all our debts, without compassion or
   mercy, (Isa 58:3);

   and so also is the praising of any commodity we sell, contrary to our
   own

   knowledge, or the debasing of anything we buy, against our own
   conscience, (Isa

   5:20, Prov 20:14); and so also is the hoarding up, or withholding the
   selling of

   corn and other necessary commodities when we may spare them, and others
   have

   need of them, (Prov 11:26); and so also is the retaining of hireling's
   wages,

   (James 5:4); and so also is uncharitable inclosure, (Isa 5:8); and so
   also is the

   selling of any commodity by false weights or false measures, (Lev
   19:35): and so

   also is the concealing of things found, and withholding them from the
   right owners

   when they are known; and so also is robbery, or the laying of violent
   and strong

   hands on any part of the wealth that belongs unto another, (Zech
   4:3,4); and so

   also is pilfering and secret carrying away of the wealth that belongs
   to another,

   (Josh 7:21); and so also is the consenting to the taking away the goods
   of another,

   (Psa 90:18); and so also is the receiving or harbouring of stolen
   goods, (Prov

   29:24).

   Neo. Well, now, sir, I pray you proceed to the affirmative part of this

   commandment, and tell us what the Lord therein requires.

   Evan. In this commandment is required contentedness of mind with that
   part and

   portion of wealth and outward good things which God, in his providence,
   has

   allotted unto us, (Heb 13:5, 1 Tim 6:6-8); and so also in resting by
   faith upon the

   promise of God, and depending upon his providence, without distrustful
   care,

   (Matt 6:20,26); and so also is a moderate desire of such things as are
   convenient

   and necessary for us, (Matt 6:21, Prov 30:8); and so also is a moderate
   care to

   provide those things which are needful for us, (Gen 30:30, 1 Tim 5:8);
   and so

   also is an honest calling, (Gen 4:2); and so also is diligence,
   painfulness, and

   faithful labouring therein, (Gen 3:19); and so also is frugality or
   thriftiness, (Prov

   27:23,24, John 6:12); and so also is borrowing for need and good ends,
   what we

   are able to repay, and making payment with thanks and cheerfulness,
   (Exo

   22:14); and so also is lending freely without compounding for gain,
   (Deut 15:8,

   Luke 6:35); and so also is giving, or communicating outward things unto
   others,

   according to our ability and their necessity, (Luke 11:41); and so also
   is the using

   of truth, simplicity, and plainness in buying and selling, in hiring
   and letting, (Lev

   25:14, Deut 25:13-15); and so also is the restoring of things found,
   (Deut 22:2,3);

   and so also is the restoring of things committed to our trust, (Eze
   18:7). And thus

   have I endeavoured to satisfy your desire concerning the eighth
   commandment;

   and now, neighbour Nomologista, I pray you, tell me whether you think
   you keep

   it perfectly or not.

   Nom. I can say this truly, that I never in all my life took away, or
   consented to

   the taking away, of so much as a penny-worth of any other man's goods.

   Evan. Though you did not, yet if there ever have been in your heart any

   discontentedness with your own estate, or any envious thoughts towards
   others in

   regard of their prosperity in the world, or any resolution to be rich,
   otherwise than

   by the moderate use of lawful means, or if ever you borrowed and paid
   not again,

   to the utmost of your ability, or if ever you lent upon usury, or if
   ever you did

   cruelly require any debt above the ability of your debtor, or if ever
   you praised

   anything you had to sell above the known worth of it, or if ever you
   did

   undervalue anything you were to buy, contrary to your own thoughts of
   it, or if

   ever you hoarded up corn in the time of dearth, or if ever you retained
   the

   hireling's wages in your hands, to his loss or hindrance, or if ever
   you did sell any

   commodity by false weights or measures, or if ever you did conceal
   anything

   found from the right owner, when you knew him; then have you been
   guilty of

   theft, and so have been a transgressor of this commandment.

   And though you never have done any of these things, and it is strange
   if you have

   not, yet if ever you were guilty of idleness, sloth, or any way
   unwarrantably

   neglected your calling, or if ever you did unthriftily misspend any of
   your own

   goods, or ever were negligent and careless in ordering your own affairs
   and

   business, or if ever you sustained any loss by your unadvised
   suretyship, or if

   ever you borrowed upon usury, except in case of extreme necessity, then
   have

   you been guilty of robbing yourself, and so have been a transgressor of
   this

   commandment.

   Neo. Now, I pray you, sir, proceed to speak of the ninth commandment,
   as you

   have done of the rest.
     __________________________________________________________________

COMMANDMENT IX.

   Evan. Well, then I pray you consider, that in the ninth commandment
   there is a

   negative part expressed in these words: "Thou shalt not bear false
   witness against

   thy neighbour"; that is, thou shalt not think or speak anything
   contrary to truth, or

   that may tend to the hurt or hindrance either of thine own or thy
   neighbour's good

   name. And an affirmative part included in these words: "But thou shalt
   by all

   good means seek to maintain them both, according to truth and a good

   conscience."

   Neo. Well, sir, I pray you, begin with the negative part; and first
   tell us what is

   forbidden in this commandment, in respect of our own good name.

   Evan. That we may not be guilty of bearing false witness against
   ourselves, either

   by overvaluing or undervaluing ourselves, in this commandment is
   forbidden too

   high a conceit or esteem of ourselves, (Luke 18:9-11); and so also is
   too mean a

   conceit, in underweening the good things that are in ourselves, (Exo
   4:10,13); and

   so also is the procuring of ourselves an evil name, by walking
   indiscreetly and

   offensively, (Rom 2:24); and so also is the unjust accusing of
   ourselves, when

   we, in a way of proud humility, say, "We have no grace, no wit, no
   wealth," &c.

   (Prov 13:7); and so also is the excusing of our faults by way of lying,
   (Lev

   19:11).

   Neo. And what is forbidden in this commandment, in respect to our
   neighbour's

   good name?

   Evan. That we may not be guilty of bearing false witness against any
   other man,

   in this commandment is forbidden contemning or thinking basely of
   others, (2

   Sam 6:16); and so also is wrongful suspicion, or evil surmising, (2 Sam
   10:3); and

   so also is rash, uncharitable, unjust judging and condemning of others,
   (Matt 7:1);

   and so also is foolish admiring of others, (Acts 12:22); and so also is
   the unjust

   reviving the memory of our neighbour's crimes, which were in tract of
   time

   forgotten, (Prov 17:9); and so also is the forbearing to speak in the
   cause and for

   the credit of our neighbours, (Prov 31:8,9): and so also are all
   flattering speeches,

   (Job 32:21,22): and so also is tale- bearing, backbiting, and
   slanderous speeches,

   (Lev 19:16, Prov 20:19); and so also is listening to tale-bearers,
   (Prov 26:20,

   25:23); and so also is falsely charging some ill upon another before
   some

   magistrate, or in some open court, (Amos 7:10, Acts 25:2).

   Neo. I pray you, sir, proceed to the affirmative part of this
   commandment, and

   first tell us what the Lord requires of us for the maintenance of our
   own good

   name.

   Evan. For the maintenance of our own good name, the Lord in this

   commandment requires a right judgment of ourselves, (2 Cor 13:5); with
   a love

   to, and care of our own good name, (Prov 22:1).

   Neo. And what does the Lord in this commandment require of us for the

   maintenance of our neighbour's good name?

   Evan. For the maintenance of our neighbour's good name, in this
   commandment

   is required a charitable opinion and estimation of others, (1 Cor
   13:7); and so also

   is a desire of, and rejoicing in the good name of others, (Rom 1:8, Gal
   1:24); and

   so also is sorrowing and grieving for their infirmities, (Psa 119:136);
   and so also is

   the covering of others' infirmities in love, (Prov 17:9, 1 Peter 4:8);
   and so also is

   the hoping and judging the best of others, (1 Cor 13:5-7); and so is
   the

   admonishing of others before we bewray their faults, (Prov 25:9); and
   so also is

   speaking of the truth from our heart simply and plainly, upon any just
   occasion,

   (Psa 15:2, Zech 7:16); and so also is the giving of sound and
   seasonable reproofs

   for known faults, in love and with wisdom, (Lev 19:17); and so also is
   the

   praising and commending of those that do well, (Rev 2:23); and so also
   is the

   defending of the good name of others, if need so require. And thus have
   I also

   endeavoured to satisfy your desires concerning the ninth commandment:
   and

   now, neighbour Nomologista, I pray you, tell me whether you think you
   keep it

   perfectly or not.

   Nom. The truth is, sir, I did conceive that nothing tended to the
   breaking of this

   commandment, but falsely charging some ill upon another before some

   magistrate, or in some open court of justice: and that, thank God, I am
   not guilty

   of.

   Evan. Though you have not been guilty of that, yet, if you have
   contemned or

   thought too basely of any person, or have had wrongful suspicions, or
   evil

   surmisings concerning them, or have rashly and unjustly judged and
   condemned

   them, or if you have foolishly admired them, or unjustly revived the
   memory of

   any forgotten crime, or have given them any flattering speeches, or
   have been a

   tale-bearer, or a backbiter, or a slanderer, or a listener to
   tale-bearers, you have

   borne false witness against your neighbour, and so have been guilty of
   the breach

   of this commandment.

   Or if you have not had a charitable opinion of others, or have not
   desired and

   rejoiced in the good name of others, or have not sorrowed and grieved
   for their

   sinful infirmities, or have not covered them in love, or have not hoped
   and judged

   the best of them, or have not admonished them before you had discovered
   their

   faults to others, or have not given to others sound and seasonable
   reproof, or

   have not praised them that do well, then have you also been guilty of
   false

   witness-bearing against your neighbour, and so have transgressed this

   commandment. And though you never have done any of these things, and it
   is

   strange if you have not, yet if you have had too high a conceit of
   yourself, or

   have after a proud humble manner unjustly accused yourself, or have
   procured

   yourself an evil name, by walking indiscreetly and offensively, or have
   excused

   any fault by way of lying, then have you borne false witness against
   yourself, and

   thereby have transgressed this commandment.

   Neo. I beseech you, sir, proceed to speak of the last commandment as
   you have

   done of the rest.
     __________________________________________________________________

COMMANDMENT X.

   Evan. Well, then, I pray you consider, that in the tenth commandment
   there is a

   negative part expressed in these words, "Thou shalt not covet," &c.:
   that is, thou

   shalt not inwardly think on, nor long after, that which belongs to
   another, though

   it be without consent of will, or purpose of heart to seek after it;
   and an

   affirmative part included in these words, "But thou shalt be well
   contented with

   thine own outward condition, and heartily desire the good of thy
   neighbours."

   Neo. Well, sir, I pray you, begin with the negative part; and first
   tell us what the

   Lord forbids in this commandment.

   Evan. I pray you take notice, and consider, that this tenth commandment
   was

   given to be a rule and level, according to the which we must take and
   measure

   our inward obedience to all the other commandments contained in the
   second

   table of God's law. For the Lawgiver having, in the rest of the
   commandments,

   dealt with those sins especially which stand in deeds, and are done of
   purpose, or

   with an advised consent of will, although there is no doubt but that
   the law of

   restraining concupiscence is implied and included in all the former

   commandments; now, last of all, in this last commandment deals with
   those sins

   which are called only concupiscences, and do contain all inward
   stirring and

   conceit in the understanding and affections against every commandment
   of the

   law, and are, as it were, rivers boiling out of the fountain of that
   original sin; for

   to covet, in this place, signifies to have a motion of the heart
   without any settled

   consent of will. Briefly, then, in this commandment is forbidden, not
   only the evil

   act and evil thought settled, and with full and deliberate consent of
   will, as in the

   former commandments, but here also is forbidden the very first motions
   and

   inclinations to every evil that is forbidden in any of the former
   commandments, as

   it is evident, (Rom 7:7, 13:9); for it is not said in this commandment,
   Thou shalt

   not consent to lust, but "Thou shalt not lust." It does not only
   command the

   binding of lust, but it also forbids the being of lust; which being so,
   who sees not

   that in this commandment is contained the perfect obedience to the
   whole law?

   for how comes it to pass, that we sin against every commandment, but
   because

   this corrupt concupiscence is in us, without which we should of our own
   accord,

   with our whole mind and body, be apt to do only good without any
   thought or

   desire at all to the contrary? And this is all I have to say touching
   the negative part

   of this commandment.

   Neo. Well, then, sir, I pray you to proceed to the affirmative, and
   tell us what the

   Lord requires in this commandment.

   Evan. Why, original justice or righteousness is required in this
   commandment,

   which is a disposition and an inclination and a desire to perform unto
   God, and to

   our neighbour, for God's sake, all the duties which are contained both
   in the first

   and second table of the law; whence it does evidently appear, that it
   is not

   sufficient, though we forbear the evil, and do the good which is
   contained in

   every commandment, except we do it readily and willingly, and for the
   Lord's

   sake. As for example, to give you a few instances, it is not sufficient
   though we

   abstain from making images, or worshipping God by an image; no, though
   we

   perform all the parts of his true worship, as praying, reading,
   hearing, receiving

   the sacraments, and the like, if we do it unwillingly or in obedience
   to any law or

   commandment of man, and not for the Lord's sake. Neither is it
   sufficient though

   we abstain from the works of our callings on the Lord's day, and
   perform never

   so many religious exercises, if it be unwillingly, and for form and
   custom's sake,

   or in mere obedience to any superior, and not for the Lord's sake.
   Neither is it

   sufficient though a child show never so much honour, love, and respect
   to his

   parents, if he do it by constraint and unwillingly, or to gain the
   praise of men, and

   not for the Lord's sake. Neither is it sufficient though a servant do
   his duty, and

   carry himself never so well, if it be for fear of correction, or for
   his own profit

   and gain, and not for the Lord's sake. Neither is it sufficient though
   a wife carry

   herself never so dutifully and respectfully towards her husband, both
   in word and

   deed, if it be unwillingly, for fear of his frowns, or to gain the
   applause of them

   that behold it, and not for the Lord's sake. Neither is it sufficient
   though a

   husband show much love and respect to his wife, if it be because she is
   amiable

   or profitable, or to gain the praise of men, and not for the Lord's
   sake. In a word,

   it is not sufficient, though any man or woman do all their duties, in
   all their

   relations, if they do them merely for their own sake, and not for the
   Lord's sake.

   Neither is it sufficient though a man abstain from killing, yea, and
   from striking, if

   it be for fear of the law, and not for the Lord's sake. Neither is it
   sufficient though

   he bridle his anger, and abstain from expressing any wrath, if it be
   because he

   would be counted a patient man, and not for the Lord's sake. Neither is
   it

   sufficient though a man visit the sick, clothe the naked, feed the
   hungry, or in

   never so many ways seek to preserve the life of his neighbour, if it be
   for the

   praise of men, and not for the Lord's sake. Neither is it sufficient
   though a man

   abstain from committing adultery, if it be for fear of the shame or
   punishment that

   will follow, and not for the Lord's sake. Nor though we also abstain
   from

   idleness, gluttony, and drunkenness, if it be for our own gain's sake,
   and not for

   the Lord's sake. Neither is it sufficient though we abstain from
   stealing, and

   labour diligently in our callings, if it be for the fear of shame or
   punishment, or for

   the praise of men. Neither is it sufficient though we have abstained
   from false

   witness-bearing, and have spoken the truth, if it have been for fear of
   shame, or

   merely to do our neighbour a courtesy, and not because the Lord
   requires it.

   Thus might I have instanced in divers other particulars, wherein,
   though we have

   done that which is required, and avoided that which is forbidden, yet
   if it have

   been for our own ends, in any of the particulars before mentioned; yea,
   or if it

   have been merely or chiefly to escape hell and to obtain heaven, and
   not for the

   love we bear to God, and for the desire we have to please him, we have
   therein

   transgressed the Lord's commandments. And now, neighbour Nomologista, I
   pray

   you consider, whether you have gone near to the keeping of all the

   commandments perfectly or no.

   Nom. But, sir, are you sure that the Lord requires that every man
   should keep all

   the ten commandments according as you have now expounded them?
     __________________________________________________________________

THE USE OF THE LAW.

   Evan. Yea, indeed he does; and if you make any question of it, I pray
   you,

   consider further, that one asking our Saviour, which is the "great
   commandment

   in the law?" he answered, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
   thy heart,

   and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This," says he, "is the
   first and great

   commandment; and the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy
   neighbour as

   thyself," (Matt 22:37-39).

   Whereupon, says a famous spiritual expositor, "God will have the whole
   heart";

   all the powers of our souls must be bent towards him, he will have
   himself to be

   acknowledged and reckoned as our sovereign and supreme good; our love
   to him

   must be perfect and absolute: he requires, that there be not found in
   us the least

   thought, inclination, or appetite of anything which may displease him;
   and that we

   direct all our actions to this very end, that he alone may be glorified
   by us; and

   that for the love we bear unto God, we must do well unto our neighbour,

   according to the commandments of God. Consider, also, I pray you, that
   it is

   said, (Deut 27:26, Gal 3:10), "Cursed is every one that continueth not
   in all things

   which are written in the book of the law to do them." Now, if you do
   consider

   these things well, you shall perceive that the Lord requires that every
   man do

   keep all the ten commandments perfectly, according as I have expounded
   them,

   and concludes all those under the curse that do not so keep them.

   Nom. Surely, sir, you did mistake in saying that the Lord requires that
   every man

   do keep all the ten commandments perfectly; for I suppose you would
   have said,

   the Lord requires that every man do endeavour to keep them perfectly.

   Evan. No, neighbour Nomologista, I did not mistake, for I say it again,
   that the

   Lord requires of every man perfect obedience to all the ten
   commandments, and

   concludes all those under the curse that do not yield it; for it is not
   said, Cursed is

   every man that does not endeavour to continue in all things, but
   "Cursed is every

   one that continueth not in all things," &c.

   Nom. But, sir, do you think that any man continues in all things, as
   you have

   expounded them?

   Evan. No, no; it is impossible that any man should.

   Nom. And, sir, what is it to be under the curse?

   Evan. To be under the curse, as Luther and Perkins do well agree, is to
   be under

   sin, the wrath of God, and everlasting death.

   Nom. But, sir, I pray you, how can this stand with the justice of God,
   to require

   man to do that which is impossible, and yet to conclude him under the
   curse for

   not doing it?

   Evan. You shall perceive that it does well stand with the justice of
   God, to deal so

   with man, if you do consider, that this law of God, or these ten
   commandments,

   which we have now expounded, are, as Ursinus' Catechism truly says, "A

   doctrine agreeing with the eternal and immortal wisdom and justice that
   is in

   God"; wherein, says Calvin, "God hath so painted out his own nature,
   that it doth

   in a manner express the very image of God." And we read, (Gen 1:27),
   that man

   at the first was created in the image or likeness of God; whence it
   must needs

   follow that this law was written in his heart, that is to say, God did
   engrave in

   man's heart such wisdom and knowledge of his will and works, and such
   integrity

   in his soul, and such a fitness in all the powers thereof, that his
   mind was able to

   conceive, and his heart was able to desire, and his body was able to
   put in

   execution, anything that was acceptable to God; so that in very deed he
   was able

   to keep all the ten commandments perfectly.

   And, therefore, though God do require of man impossible things, yet is
   he not

   unjust, neither does he injure us in so doing, because he commanded
   them when

   they were possible, and though we have now lost our ability of
   performance, yet

   it being by our voluntary falling from the state of innocence in which
   we were at

   first created, God has not lost his right of requiring that of us which
   he once gave

   us.

   Nom. But, sir, you know it was our first parents only that did fall
   away from God

   in eating the forbidden fruit, and none of their posterity; how then
   can it be truly

   said, that we have lost that power through our own default?

   Evan. For answer to this, I pray you consider, that Adam, by God's
   appointment,

   was not to stand or fall as a single person only, but as a common
   public person,

   representing all mankind which were to come of him; and therefore, as
   in case of

   he had been obedient, and not eaten the forbidden fruit, he had
   retained and kept

   that power which he had by creation, as well for all mankind, as for
   himself; even

   so by his disobedience in eating that forbidden fruit, he was disrobed
   of God's

   image, and so lost that power, as well for all mankind as for himself.

   Nom. Why then, sir, it should seem that all mankind are under sin,
   wrath, and

   eternal death!

   Evan. Yea, indeed by nature they are so, "For we know," says the
   apostle, "that

   whatsoever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law, that
   every mouth

   may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God," (Rom
   3:19);

   and again, says he, "We have proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they
   are all

   under sin," (Rom 3:9). And in another place he says, "We were by nature
   children

   of wrath as well as others," (Eph 2:3); and, lastly, he says, "So death
   passed upon

   all men, for that all have sinned," (Rom 5:12).

   Nom. But, sir, I pray you, tell me whether you think that any
   regenerate man

   keeps the commandments perfectly, according as you have expounded them.

   Evan. No, not the most sanctified man in the world.

   Nom. Why then, sir, it should seem, that not only natural men, but
   regenerate

   men also, are under the curse of the law. For if every one that keepeth
   not the

   law perfectly be concluded under the curse, and if regenerate men do
   not keep

   the law perfectly, then they also must needs be under the curse.

   Evan. The conclusion of your argument is not true; for if by regenerate
   men you

   mean true believers, then they have fulfilled the law perfectly in
   Christ, or rather

   Christ has perfectly fulfilled the law in them, and was made a curse
   for them, and

   so has redeemed them from the curse of the law, as you may see, (Gal
   3:13).

   Nom. Well, sir, now do I understand you, and have ever been of your
   judgment

   in that point, for I have ever concluded this, that either a man
   himself, or Christ

   for him, must keep the law perfectly, or else God will not accept of
   him, and

   therefore have I endeavoured to do the best I could to keep the law
   perfectly, and

   wherein I have failed and come short, I have believed that Christ has
   done it for

   me.

   Evan. The apostle says, (Gal 3:10), "So many as are of the works of the
   law, are

   under the curse." And truly, neighbour Nomologista, if I may speak it
   without

   offence, I fear me you are still of the works of the law, and therefore
   still under

   the curse.

   Nom. Why, sir, I pray you, what is it to be of the works of the law?

   Evan. To be of the works of the law, is for a man to look for, or hope
   to be

   justified or accepted in the sight of God, for his own obedience to the
   law.

   Nom. But surely, sir, I never did so; for though by reason of my being
   ignorant of

   what is required and forbidden in every commandment, I had a conceit
   that I

   came very near the perfect fulfilling of the law, yet I never thought I
   did do all

   things that are contained therein; and therefore I never looked for,
   nor hoped that

   God would accept me for mine own obedience, without Christ's being
   joined with

   it.

   Evan. Then it seems that you did conceive, that your obedience and
   Christ's

   obedience must be joined together, and so God would accept you for
   that.

   Nom. Yea, indeed, sir, there has been my hope, and indeed there is
   still my hope.

   Evan. Aye, but neighbour Nomologista, as I told my neighbour Neophytus
   and

   others not long since, so I tell you now, that as the justice of God
   requires a

   perfect obedience, so does it require that this perfect obedience be a
   personal

   obedience, that is, it must be the obedience of one person only. The
   obedience of

   two must not be put together to make up a perfect obedience: and
   indeed, to say

   as the thing is, God will have none to have a hand in the justification
   and salvation

   of any man, but Christ only; for, says the apostle Peter, (Acts 4:12),
   "Neither is

   there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven
   given

   among men whereby we may be saved." Believe it then, I beseech you,
   that

   Christ Jesus will either be a whole Saviour, or no Saviour; he will
   either save you

   alone, or not save you at all.

   Nom. But, sir, if man's obedience to the law do not help to procure his

   justification and acceptance with God, then why did God give the law to
   the

   Israelites upon Mount Sinai, and why is it read and expounded by you
   that are

   ministers? I would gladly know of what use it is.

   Evan. The apostle says, (Gal 3:19), "That the law was added because of

   transgression." That is, as Luther expounds it, "That transgressions
   might increase

   and be more known, and seen"; or as Perkins expounds it, "For the
   revealing of

   sin, and the punishment thereof; for by the law comes the knowledge of
   sin," as

   the same apostle says, (Rom 3:20); and therefore when the children of
   Israel

   conceived that they were righteous, and could keep all God's
   commandments

   perfectly, as it is manifested by their saying, (Exo 19:8), "All that
   the Lord

   commandeth we will do, and be obedient," the Lord gave them this law,
   to the

   intent they might see how far short they came of yielding that
   obedience which is

   therein required, and so, consequently, how sinful they were. And just
   so did our

   Saviour also deal with the young expounder of the law, (Matt 19:16),
   who, it

   seems, was sick of the same disease, "Good Master," says he, "what
   shall I do

   that I may inherit eternal life?" "He does not," says Calvin, "simply
   ask, which

   way, or by what means he should come to eternal life, but what good he
   should

   do to get it." Whereby it appears, that he was a proud justiciary, one
   that swelled

   in fleshly opinion that he could keep the law, and be saved by it;
   therefore he is

   worthily sent to the law to work himself weary, and to see his need to
   come to

   Christ for remedy.

   Now then, if you would know of what use the law is, why first let me
   tell you, it

   is of special use to all such as have a conceit that they themselves
   can do anything

   for the procuring of their own justification and acceptation in the
   sight of God; to

   let them see, as in a glass, that in that case they can do nothing.
   And, therefore,

   seeing that you yourself have such a conceit, I beseech you, labour to
   make that

   use of it, that so you may be hereby quite driven out of yourself unto
   Jesus

   Christ.

   Nom. Believe me, sir, I should be glad I could make such a good use of
   it, and,

   therefore, I pray you, give me some directions how I may do it.

   Evan. Why, first of all, I would desire you to consider, that in regard
   that all

   mankind were at first created in such an estate as I have declared unto
   you, the

   law and justice of God requires that the man who undertakes, by his
   obedience,

   to procure his justification and acceptation in the sight of God,
   either in whole, or

   in part, be as completely furnished with the habit of righteousness and
   true

   holiness, and as free from all corruption of nature, as Adam was in the
   state of

   innocency, that so there may not be the least corruption mingled with
   any of

   those good actions which he does, nor the least motion of heart or
   inclination of

   will towards any of those evil actions which he does not do.

   Secondly, I would desire you to consider, that neither you nor any man
   else,

   whilst you live upon the earth, shall be so furnished with perfect
   righteousness

   and true holiness, nor so free from all corruptions of nature, as Adam
   was in the

   state of innocency; so that no good action which you do shall be free
   from having

   some corruption mingled with it: nor any evil action which you do not
   do, free

   from some motion of heart or inclination of will towards it; and that
   therefore you

   can do nothing towards the procuring of your justification and
   acceptation in the

   sight of God; the which the prophet David well considering, cries out,
   (Psa 143:2)

   "Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord! for in thy sight
   shall not man

   living be justified." Yea, and this made the apostle cry out, "Oh
   wretched man

   that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death"! (Rom
   7:24). Yea,

   and this made him desire to be found in Christ, not having his own
   righteousness

   which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ,
   (Phil 3:9).

   Nom. But, sir, I am persuaded there be some good actions which I do,
   that are

   free from having any corruption at all mixed with them; and some evil
   actions

   which I do not do, towards the which I have no motion of heart, or
   inclination of

   will at all.

   Evan. Surely, neighbour Nomologista, you do not truly know yourself,
   for I am

   confident, that any man who truly knows himself, sees such secret
   corruptions of

   heart in every duty he performs, as causes him unfeignedly to confess,
   that

   whatever good action he does, it is but a polluted stream of a more
   corrupt

   fountain. And whatsoever you or any man else do conceive of yourselves,
   it is

   most certain, that whatsoever sin is forbidden in the word, or has been
   practised

   in the world, that sin every man carries in his bosom, for all have
   equally sinned

   in Adam, and therefore original lust is equally in all.

   Nom. Sir, I can hardly be persuaded to this.

   Evan. Well, neighbour Nomologista, I cannot so well tell how it is with
   you, but

   for mine own part, I tell you truly, I find my knowledge corrupted and
   defiled

   with ignorance and blindness, and my faith corrupted and defiled with
   doubting

   and distrust, and my love to God very much corrupted and defiled with
   sinful

   self-love and love to the world; and my joy in God much corrupted and
   defiled

   with carnal joy; and my godly sorrow very much corrupted and defiled
   with

   worldly sorrow.

   And I find my prayers, my hearing, my reading, my receiving the
   sacrament, and

   such like duties, very much corrupted and defiled with dullness,
   drowsiness,

   sleepiness, wandering, and worldly thoughts, and the like.

   And I find my sanctifying of the Lord's name very much corrupted and
   defiled,

   by thinking and speaking lightly and irreverently of his titles; and by
   thinking, if

   not by speaking, grudgingly against some acts of his providence.

   And I find my sanctifying of the Lord's day very much corrupted and
   defiled, by

   sleeping too long in the morning, and by worldly thoughts and words, if
   not by

   worldly works.

   And I find that all the duties that I have performed, either towards my
   superiors

   or inferiors, have been corrupted and defiled, either with too much
   indulgence, or

   with too much severity, or with base fears, or base hopes, or some
   self-end and

   by-respect.

   And I find that all my duties that I have performed, either for the
   preservation of

   mine own or other's life, chastity, goods, or good name, have been very
   much

   corrupted and defiled, either with a desire of mine own praise, own
   profit here, or

   to escape hell, and to obtain heaven hereafter; so that I see no good
   action which

   I have ever done free from having some corruption mixed with it.

   And as for motion of heart, and inclination of will towards that evil
   which I have

   not done, it is also manifest, for though I have not been guilty of
   idolatry, either in

   making or worshipping of images, yet have I not been free from carnal

   imaginations of God in the time of his worship nor from will-worship.

   And though I have not been so guilty of profaning the name of the Lord
   after

   such a gross manner as some others have been, yet have I not been free
   from an

   inclination of heart, and disposition of will thereunto; for I have
   both thought and

   spoken irreverently both of his titles, attributes, word, and works,
   yea, and many

   times do so to this day.

   And though I do not now so grossly profane the Lord's day, as it may be
   others

   have done, and do still, yet have I formerly done it grossly, yea, and
   do still, find

   an inward disposition of heart, and inclination of will, both to omit
   those duties

   which tend to the sanctifying of it, and to do those worldly actions
   which tend to

   the profanation of it.

   And though when I was a child and young, I did not so grossly dishonour
   and

   disobey my parents and other superiors, as some others did, yet I had
   an

   inclination of heart and disposition of will thereunto, as it was
   manifest by my

   stubbornness, and by not yielding of willing obedience to their
   commands nor

   submitting patiently to their reproofs and corrections.

   And though it may be, I have done more of my duty to my inferiors than
   some

   others have done, yet have I found an inclination of heart, and a
   disposition of

   will, many times to omit those duties which I have performed, so that I
   have as it

   were, been fain to constrain myself to do that which I have done.

   And though I have not been guilty of the gross act of murder, yet have
   I had, and

   have still an inclination of heart and disposition of will thereunto,
   in that I have

   been, and am still, many times subject to rash, unadvised, and
   excessive anger;

   yea, I have been and still am divers times wrathful and envious towards
   others

   that offend me.

   And though I never was guilty of the foul and gross act of fornication
   or adultery,

   yet have I had an inclination of heart, and disposition of will
   thereunto, in that I

   have not been free from filthy imaginations, unchaste thoughts, and
   inward

   motions and desire to uncleanness.

   And though I was never guilty of the gross act of stealing, yet have I
   had an

   inclination of heart, and a disposition of will thereunto, in that I
   have neither been

   free from discontentedness with mine own estate, nor from covetous
   desire after

   that which belongs to another.

   And though I never did bear false witness against any man, yet have I
   had an

   inclination of heart and disposition of will thereunto, in that I have
   not been free

   from contemning, despising, and thinking too basely of others; neither
   have I been

   free from evil surmisings, groundless suspicions, and rash judging of
   others.

   And now, neighbour Nomologista, I pray you tell me whether you do think
   that

   some of these corruptions are in you, which you hear are in me.

   Nom. Yea, believe me, sir, I must needs confess that some of them are.

   Evan. Well, though you have but only one of them in you, yet I pray you

   consider, that you do hereby transgress one of the ten commandments;
   and the

   apostle James says, that "Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet
   offend in

   one point, he is guilty of all," (James 2:10). And call to mind, I also
   pray you, that

   a curse is denounced against all those that continue not in "all things
   which are

   written in the book of the law to do them." Mind it, I pray you, "that
   doth not

   continue in all things": so that although you could for a time do all
   that the law

   requires, and avoid all that it forbids, and that never so exactly, yet
   if you do not

   continue so doing, but transgress the law once in all your life, and
   that only in one

   thought, you are thereby become subject to the curse, which, as you
   have heard,

   is eternal damnation in hell.

   Nay, let me tell you more, although you never yet had transgressed the
   law in all

   your life hitherto, not so much as in the least thought, nor ever
   should do whilst

   you live, yet should you thereby become far short of the perfect
   fulfilling of the

   law, and so consequently of your justification and acceptation in the
   sight of God.

   Nom. That is very strange to me, sir, for what can be required more, or
   what can

   be done more, than yielding of perfect and perpetual obedience?

   Evan. That is true indeed; there is no more required, neither can there
   be more

   done; but yet you must understand, that the law does as well require
   passive

   obedience as active, suffering as well as doing; for our common bond
   entered into

   for us all, by God's benefits towards the first man, is by his
   disobedience become

   forfeited, both in respect of himself and all mankind; and, therefore,
   ever since

   the fall of man, the law and justice of God does not only require the
   payment of

   the debt, but also of the forfeiture; there is not only required of him
   perfect doing,

   but also perfect suffering. "In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
   shalt die the

   death," says the Lord, (Gen 2:17). Nay, let me tell you yet more; in
   order of

   justice, the forfeiture ought to be paid before the debt; perfect
   suffering should go

   before perfect doing, because all mankind, by reason of that first and
   great

   transgression, are at odds and enmity with God; they are all of them
   children of

   his wrath, and therefore God, as we may speak with holy reverence,
   cannot be

   reconciled unto any man, before a full satisfaction be made to his
   justice by a

   perfect suffering, (Col 1:21): perfect suffering, then, is required for
   the reconciling

   of man unto God, (Eph 2:3), and setting him in the same condition he
   was in

   before his fall, and perfect doing is required for the keeping of him
   in that

   condition.

   Nom. And, sir, is man as unable to pay the forfeiture as he is to pay
   the debt? I

   mean, is he as unable to suffer perfectly, as to do perfectly?

   Evan. Yea, indeed, every whit as unable; forasmuch as man's sin in
   eating of the

   forbidden fruit was committed against God, and God is infinite and
   eternal, and

   the offence is always multiplied according to the dignity of the person
   against

   whom it is committed: man's offence must needs be an infinite offence,
   and the

   punishment must needs be proportionable to the fault; therefore an
   infinite and

   eternal punishment is required at man's hands, or else such a temporal

   punishment, as is equal and answerable to eternal. Now, eternal
   punishment man

   cannot sustain, because then he should never be delivered--he should
   ever be

   satisfying, and never have satisfied; which satisfaction is such as is
   the

   punishment of the devils and damned men in hell, which never shall have
   an end.

   And for temporal punishment, which should be equivalent to eternal,
   that cannot

   be neither, because the power and vigour of no creature is such that it
   may

   sustain a finite and temporal punishment, equivalent to an infinite and
   eternal; for

   sooner should the creature be wasted, consumed, and brought to nothing,
   than it

   could satisfy the justice of God by this means; wherefore we may
   certainly

   conclude, that no man can satisfy the law and justice of God, either by
   active or

   by passive obedience, and so consequently no man shall be justified and
   accepted

   in the sight of God by his own doings or sufferings.

   Nom. Sir, I see it clearly, and am therein fully convinced, and I hope
   I shall make

   that use of it. But, sir, is there no other use to be made of the law
   than this?

   Evan. Yea, neighbour Nomologista, you must not only labour thereby to
   see your

   own insufficiency to procure your own justification and acceptation in
   the sight of

   God, though that indeed be the chief use that any unjustified person
   ought to

   endeavour to make of it, but you must also endeavour to make it a rule
   of

   direction to you in your life and conversation.

   Nom. But, sir, if I cannot by my obedience to the law do anything
   towards the

   procuring of mine own justification, and acceptation in the sight of
   God, or, which

   as I do conceive is all one, if I can do nothing towards the procuring
   of mine own

   eternal salvation, then methinks all that I do should be in vain, for I
   cannot see

   any good I shall get thereby.

   Evan. No, neighbour Nomologista, it shall not be in vain; for though
   you cannot

   by your obedience to the law, do any thing towards the procuring of
   your own

   justification or eternal salvation; yea, and though you should never
   make such a

   use of it, as to be thereby driven out of yourself unto Jesus Christ
   for justification

   and eternal salvation, but should be everlastingly condemned; yet, this
   let me tell

   you, the more obedience you yield unto the law, the more easy shall
   your

   condemnation be; for although no man, walk he ever so exactly and
   strictly

   according to the law, shall thereby either escape the torments of hell,
   or obtain the

   joys of heaven, yet the more exactly and strictly any man walks
   according to the

   law, the easier shall his torments be, (Matt 11:22). So that although
   you by your

   obedience to the law cannot obtain the uneasiest place in heaven, yet
   may you

   thereby obtain the most easy place in hell: and therefore your
   obedience shall not

   be in vain. Nay, let me tell you more, although you by your obedience
   to the law

   can neither escape that hell, nor enjoy that heaven that is in the
   world to come,

   yet you may thereby escape that hell, and enjoy that heaven which is to
   be had in

   this present world; for the Lord dealeth so equally and justly with all
   men, that

   every man shall be sure to receive his due at his hands; so that as
   every man who

   is truly justified in the sight of God, by faith in Christ's blood,
   shall for that

   blood's sake be sure of the joys of heaven, though his life may even
   after his

   believing be in many respects unconformable to the law; yet the more

   unconformable his life is thereunto, the more crosses and afflictions
   he shall be

   sure to meet withal in this life, (Psa 89:30-32). Even so, though no
   man that is not

   justified by faith in Christ's blood shall either escape the torments
   of hell, or attain

   the joys of heaven, be his life never so conformable to the law, yet
   the more

   conformable his life is thereunto, the less of the miseries and the
   more of the

   blessings of this life he shall have; for it is not to men unjustified,
   though I

   suppose not only to them that the Lord speaketh, (Isa 1:19), saying,
   "If ye be

   willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good things of the land." And
   does not the

   Lord in the fifth commandment promise the blessing of long life to all
   inferiors

   that are obedient to their superiors? And may we not observe, and is it
   not found

   true by experience, that those children who are most careful of doing
   their duties

   to their parents, are commonly more free both from their parents'
   corrections and

   the Lord's corrections; and are likewise blessed with obedient children

   themselves, and do also taste of their parents' bounty and the Lord's
   bounty, as

   touching the blessings of this life, more than others that are
   disobedient? And may

   we not observe, and is it not found true by experience, that those
   servants that are

   most faithful and diligent in their places are commonly more free
   either from the

   Lord's or their masters' corrections, and are likewise rewarded with
   such servants

   themselves, and with other temporal blessings both from their masters
   and from

   the Lord, than others that are not so? And may we not observe, and is
   it not

   found true by experience, that those wives that are obedient and
   subject to their

   husbands, are commonly more free from their frowns, checks, and
   rebukes; at

   least they are more blessed with peace of conscience and a good name
   amongst

   men, than others that are not so? And may we not observe, that our mere
   honest

   men, who for the most part live without committing any gross sin
   against the law,

   are commonly more exempted from the sword of the magistrate, and have
   many

   earthly blessings more in abundance than such as are gross sinners? And
   the

   Scribes and Pharisees, who were strict observers of the law, in regard
   of the

   outward man, were no losers by it, "Verily," says our Saviour, "I say
   unto you,

   they have their reward," (Matt 6:2). So that still, you see, your
   obedience to the

   law shall not be in vain; wherefore, I pray you, do your best to keep
   the ten

   commandments as perfectly as you can. But above all, I beseech you, be
   careful

   to consider of that which has been said touching the special use of the
   law to you,

   that so through the powerful working of God's Spirit, it may become an
   effectual

   means to drive you out of yourself unto Jesus Christ.

   Oh, consider, in the first place, what a great number of duties are
   required and

   what a great number of sins are forbidden in every one of the ten

   commandments! And in the second place, consider, how many of those
   duties

   you have omitted, and how many of those sins you have committed. And in
   the

   third place, consider, that there has been much corruption mixed with
   every good

   duty which you have done, so that you have sinned in doing that which
   in itself is

   good; and that you have had an inclination of heart and disposition of
   will to

   every sin you have not committed, and so have been guilty of all those
   sins which

   you have not done. And in the fourth place, consider, that the law
   denounceth a

   curse unto every one which continueth not in all things which are
   written in the

   book of the law to do them. And then, in the fifth place, make
   application of the

   curse unto yourself, by saying in your heart, if every one be cursed
   which

   continueth not in all things, then surely I am cursed that have
   continued in

   nothing. And then, in the sixth place, consider, that before you can be
   delivered

   from the curse, the law and justice of God requires that there be a
   perfect

   satisfaction made both by paying the debt and the forfeiture to the
   very utmost

   farthing; perfect doing and perfect suffering are both of them
   required. And then,

   in the last place, consider, that you are so far from being able to
   make a perfect

   satisfaction, that you can do nothing at all towards it, and that
   therefore, as of

   yourself, you are in a most miserable and helpless condition.

   Nom. Well, sir, I do now plainly see that I have been deceived, for I
   verily

   thought that the only reason why the Lord gave the law, and why you
   that are

   ministers do show us what is required and forbidden in the law, had
   been, that all

   men might thereby come to see what the mind and will of the Lord is,
   and be

   exhorted, and persuaded to lead their lives thereafter. And I also
   verily thought

   that the more any man did strive and endeavour to reform his life and
   do

   thereafter, the more he procured the love and favour of God towards
   him, and

   the more God would bless him, and do him good, both in this world and
   in the

   world to come; yea, and I also verily thought, that it had been in the
   man's power

   to have come very near the perfect fulfilling of the law, for I never
   read nor heard

   any minister show how impossible it is for any man to keep the law, nor
   ever

   make any mention of any such use of the law, as you have done this day.

   Evan. Surely, neighbour Nomologista, these have not only been your
   thoughts,

   but also the thoughts of many other men; for it is natural for every
   man to think

   that he must and can procure God's favour and eternal happiness by his

   obedience to the law, at the least to think he can do something towards
   it; for

   naturally men think that the law requires no more but the external act,
   and that

   therefore it is in man's power to keep it perfectly. Is it not an
   ordinary and

   common thing for men when they hear or read that there is more required
   and

   forbidden in the law than they were aware of, to think with themselves,
   Surely, I

   am not right, I have transgressed the law more than I had thought I had
   done, and

   therefore God is more angry with me than I had thought he had been; and

   therefore to pacify his anger, and procure his favour towards me, I
   must repent,

   amend, and do better; I must reform my life according to the law, and
   so by my

   future obedience make amends for my former disobedience? And if
   thereupon

   they do attain to any good measure of outward conformity, then they
   think they

   come near the perfect fulfilling of the law; and if it were not that
   the doctrine of

   the Church of England is, that no man can fulfil the law perfectly, and
   that none

   but Papists do say the contrary, they would both think and say they
   did, or hoped

   they should keep all the commandments perfectly. And upon occasions of
   this

   their outward reformation according to the law, they think, yea, and
   sometimes

   say, they are regenerate men and true converts, and that the beginning
   of this

   their reformation was the time of their new birth and conversion unto
   God. And if

   these men do confess themselves to be sinners, it is rather because
   they hear all

   others confess themselves so to be, than out of any true sight and
   knowledge,

   sense, or feeling they have of any inward heart-corruption. And if they
   do

   acknowledge, that a man is not to be justified by the works of the law,
   but by

   faith in Christ, it is rather because they have heard it so preached or
   because they

   have read it so in the Bible, or some other book, than because of any

   imperfection which they see in their own works, or any need they see of
   the

   righteousness of Jesus Christ. And if they do see any imperfection in
   their own

   works, and any need of the righteousness of Jesus Christ, then they
   imagine that

   so long as their hearts are upright and sincere, and they do desire and
   endeavour

   to do their best to fulfil the law, God will accept of what they do,
   and make up

   their imperfect obedience with Christ's perfect obedience, and so will
   justify and

   save them; but all this while, their own works must have a hand in
   their

   justification and salvation, and so they are still of the works of the
   law, and

   therefore under the curse. The Lord be merciful both to you and them,
   and bring

   you under the blessing of Abraham!

   Nom. Sir, I thank you for your good wishes towards me, and for your
   great pains

   which you have now taken with me and so I will for this time take my
   leave of

   you; only, I could wish, if it might not be too much trouble to you,
   that you

   would be pleased at your leisure, to give me in writing a copy of what
   you have

   this day said concerning the law.

   Evan. Well, neighbour Nomologista, though I can hardly spare so much
   time, yet

   because you do desire it, and in hope you may receive good by it, I
   will, ere long,

   find some time to accomplish your desire.

   Neo. I pray you, neighbour Nomologista, tarry a little longer, and I
   will go with

   you.

   Nom. No, I must needs be gone; I can stay no longer.

   Evan. Then fare you well, neighbour Nomologista, and the Lord make you
   to see

   your sins!

   Nom. The Lord be with you, sir.

   Neo. Well, sir, now I hope you have fully convinced him that he comes
   far short

   of keeping all the commandments perfectly: I hope he will no longer be
   so well

   conceited of his own righteousness as he has formerly been. But now,
   sir, I pray

   you tell me before I depart, whether you would have me to endeavour to
   make

   the same use of the law, which you have advised him to make.

   Evan. No, neighbour Neophytus, I look not upon you as an unbeliever, as
   I did

   upon him, but I look upon you as one who has already been by the law
   driven out

   of yourself unto Jesus Christ; I look upon you as a true believer, and
   as a person

   already justified in the sight of God, by faith in Christ, and so as
   one who are

   neither to question your inheritance in heaven, nor fear your portion
   in hell. And

   therefore I will not persuade you to labour to yield obedience to the
   law, by telling

   you, that the more obedient you are thereunto, the easier torments you
   shall have

   in hell, as I did him; neither would I have you to make application of
   the curse of

   the law

   "Oh"! says the Lord, "that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel
   had

   walked in my ways! he should soon have fed them with the finest of
   wheat, and

   with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee." Besides, the
   more

   obedience you yield unto the ten commandments, the more glory you will
   bring to

   God, according to that of our Saviour, (John 15:8), "Herein is my
   Father glorified,

   that ye bear much fruit." To conclude, the more obedience you yield
   unto the ten

   commandments, the more good you will do unto others, according to that
   of the

   apostle, (Titus 3:8), "This is a faithful saying, and these things I
   will that thou

   affirm constantly, that they which have believed in Christ might be
   careful to

   maintain good works; these things are good and profitable unto men."

   Neo. But, sir, what if I should not purpose, desire, and endeavour to
   yield

   obedience to all the ten commandments, as you say the Lord requires;
   what then?

   Evan. Why, then, although it is true you have no cause to fear that God
   will

   proceed against you, as a wrathful judge proceeds against a malefactor,
   yet have

   you cause to fear that he will proceed against you as a displeased
   father does

   against an offending child; that is to say, although you have no cause
   to fear that

   he will unjustify you, and unson you, and deprive you of your heavenly

   inheritance, and inflict the penalty of the law of works upon you, and
   so condemn

   you, for says the apostle, "There is no condemnation to them that are
   in Christ

   Jesus," (Rom 8:1); yet have you cause to fear that he will hide his
   fatherly face,

   and withdraw the light of his countenance from you; and that your
   conscience will

   be ever accusing and disquieting of you, which if it do, then will you
   draw back,

   and be afraid to ask anything of God in prayer; for even as a child
   whose

   conscience tells him that he has angered and displeased his father,
   will be

   unwilling to come into his father's presence, especially to ask of him
   anything that

   he wants, even so it will be with you; and besides, you shall be sure
   to be

   whipped and scourged with many bodily and temporal chastisements and

   corrections, according to that which is said concerning Jesus Christ
   and his seed,

   even true believers, and justified persons, (Psa 89:31-33), "If his
   children forsake

   my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and
   walk not in

   my commandments, then will I visit their transgressions with the rod,
   and their

   iniquities with stripes. Nevertheless, my loving kindness will I not
   utterly take

   from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail."

   Wherefore, neighbour Neophytus, to apply these things a little more
   closely to

   you, and so to conclude, let me exhort you, when you come home, call to
   mind

   and consider of every commandment according as you have heard them this
   day

   expounded, and resolve to endeavour yourself to do thereafter; and
   always take

   notice how and wherein you fall and come short of doing what is
   required, and of

   avoiding what is forbidden; and especially be careful to do this when
   you are

   called to humble yourself before the Lord in fasting and prayer, and
   upon

   occasion of going to receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and so
   shall you

   make a right use of the law.

   Neo. And, sir, why would you have me more especially to take notice of
   my sins,

   when I am called to humble myself before the Lord in fasting and
   prayer?

   Evan. Because the more sinful you see yourself to be, the more humble
   will your

   heart be; and the more humble your heart is, the more fit you will be
   to pray, and

   the more the Lord will regard your prayers: wherefore, when upon
   occasion of

   some heavy and sore affliction, either felt, or feared to come upon
   yourself, or

   someone sore judgment and calamity either felt, or feared to come upon
   the

   nation or place where you live, the Lord calls you to humble yourself
   in fasting

   and prayer, then do you thereupon take occasion to meditate, and
   consider

   seriously what duties are required, and what sins are forbidden in
   every one of the

   ten commandments, and then consider how many of those duties you have

   omitted, and how many of those sins you have committed; consider also
   the

   sinful manner of performing those duties you have performed, and the
   base and

   sinful ends which you have had in the performance of them; consider
   also how

   many sinful corruptions there are in our heart, which break not forth
   in our life,

   and the disposition of heart which you have naturally to every sin
   which you do

   not commit; and then consider, that although the sins which you do now
   commit

   are not a transgression of the law of works, because you are not now
   under the

   law, (Rom 6:14); yet are they a transgression of the law of Christ,
   because you

   still are under that law, (1 Cor 9:31); and though they be not
   committed against

   God as standing in relation to you as a wrathful Judge, yet have they
   been

   committed against him as he stands in relation to you as a merciful
   loving Father;

   and though they subject you not to the wrath of a Judge, nor to the
   penalty of the

   law of works, yet they subject you to the anger and displeasure of a
   loving

   Father, and to the penalty of the law of Christ.

   Whereupon, do you draw near to God by prayer, saying unto him after
   this

   manner:

   "O merciful and loving Father! I do acknowledge that the sins which I
   did commit

   before I was a believer, were a transgression of the law of works,
   because I was

   then under that law; yea, and that they were committed against thee, as
   thou

   stoodest in relation to me as a judge, and that therefore thou mightest
   most justly

   have inflicted the curse or penalty of the law of works upon me, and so
   have cast

   me into hell; but seeing that thou hast enabled me to believe the
   gospel, viz: that

   thou hast been pleased to give thine own Son Jesus Christ to undertake
   for me, to

   become my Surety, to take my nature upon him, and to be made under the
   law,

   to redeem me from under the law, (Gal 4:4, 3:13, Rom 5:10); and to be
   made a

   curse for me, to redeem me from the curse, and to reconcile me unto
   thee by his

   death; now I know it stands not with thy justice to proceed against me
   by virtue

   of the law of works, and so cast me into hell. Nevertheless, Father, I
   know that

   the sins which I have committed since I did believe have been a
   transgression of

   the law of Christ, because I am still under that law: yea, and I do
   acknowledge,

   that they have been committed against thee, even against thee, my most
   gracious,

   merciful, and loving Father in Jesus Christ, and that it is therefore
   meet thou

   shouldest express thy fatherly anger and displeasure towards me, for
   these sins

   which thy law has discovered unto me, in bringing this affliction upon
   me, or this

   judgment upon the place or nation wherein I live: howbeit, Father, I ,
   knowing

   that thy fatherly anger towards thy children is never mixed with
   hatred, but

   always with love, and that in afflicting of them thou never intendedst
   any

   satisfaction to thine own justice, but their amendment, even the
   purging out of the

   remainder of those sinful corruptions which are still in them, and the
   conforming

   of them to thine own image; I therefore come unto thee this day, to
   humble

   myself before thee, and to call upon thy name, not for any need, or
   power that I

   do conceive I have to satisfy thy justice, or to appease thy eternal
   wrath, and to

   free my soul from hell; for that I do believe Christ has fully done for
   me already;

   but I do it in hopes thereby to pacify thy fatherly anger and
   displeasure towards

   me, and to obtain the removal of this affliction or judgment which I
   feel or fear;

   wherefore I beseech thee to pardon and forgive these my sins, which
   have been

   the procuring cause thereof; yea, I pray thee not only to pardon them,
   but also to

   purge them, that so this may be all the fruit, even the taking away of
   sin, and

   making me partaker of thy holiness; and then, Lord, remove this
   affliction and

   judgment when thy will and pleasure is."

   And thus have I showed you the reason why I would have you more
   especially to

   take notice of your sins, when you come to humble yourself before the
   Lord in

   fasting and prayer.

   Neo. And, sir, why would you have me to take notice of my sins, upon
   occasion

   of my going to receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper?

   Evan. Because the more sinful you see yourself to be, the more need you
   will see

   yourself to have of Christ; and the more need you see yourself to have
   of Christ,

   the more will you prize him; and the more you prize Christ, the more
   you will

   desire him; and the more you do desire Christ, the more fit and worthy
   receiver

   you will be.

   Wherefore, when you are determined to receive the sacrament, then take

   occasion to examine yourself as the apostle exhorts you, behold the
   face of your

   soul in the glass of the law, lay your heart and life to that rule, as
   I directed you

   before; then think with yourself and commune with your own heart,
   saying in

   your heart after this manner, "Though I do believe that all these my
   sins are for

   Christ's sake freely and fully pardoned and forgiven, so as that I
   shall never be

   condemned for them, yet do I not so fully and comfortably believe it as
   I ought,

   but am sometimes apt to question it: and besides, though my sins have
   not

   dominion over me, yet I feel them too prevalent in me, and I would fain
   have

   more power and strength against them; I would fain have my graces
   stronger and

   my corruptions weaker; wherefore I, knowing that Christ in the
   sacrament of the

   Lord's Supper, seals up unto me the assurance of the pardon and
   forgiveness of

   all my sins; yea, and knowing that the death and bloodshed of Jesus
   Christ, which

   is there represented, has in it both a pardoning and purging virtue;
   yea, and

   knowing that the more fully I do apprehend Christ by faith, the more
   strength of

   grace, and power against corruptions I shall feel:--wherefore I will go
   to partake

   of that ordinance, in hope that I shall there meet with Jesus Christ,
   and apprehend

   him more fully by faith, and so obtain both more assurances of the
   pardon of my

   sins, and the more power and strength against them"; which the Lord
   grant you

   for Christ's sake. And thus having also showed you the reason why I
   would have

   you more especially to take notice of your sins before you come to
   receive the

   sacrament of the Lord's Supper, I will now take my leave of you, for my
   other

   occasions do call me away.

   Neo. Well, sir, I do acknowledge, that you have taken great pains both
   with my

   neighbour and me this day, for the which I do give you many thanks. And
   yet I

   must entreat you to do the like courtesy for me which you promised my

   neighbour Nomologista, and that is, at your leisure, to write me out a
   copy of the

   conference we have had this day.

   Evan. Well, neighbour Neophytus, I shall think of it, and it may be,
   accomplish

   your desire. And so the God of peace be with you.

   Neo. The Lord be with you, sir.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LAW AND THE GOSPEL.

   There is little more in all this, viz: "The Marrow," to be attributed
   to me than the

   very gathering and composing of it. That which I aim at, and intend
   therein, is to

   show unto myself and others that shall read it, the difference betwixt
   the law and

   the gospel,--a point, as I conceive, very needful for us to be well
   instructed in,

   and that for these reasons:--

   First, Because, if we be ignorant thereof, we shall be very apt to mix
   and mingle

   them together, and so to confound the one with the other; which, as
   Luther on

   the Galatians, p. 31, truly says, "doth more mischief than man's reason
   can

   conceive"; and therefore he doth advise all Christians, in the case of
   justification,

   to separate the law and the gospel as far asunder as heaven and earth
   are

   separated.

   Secondly, Because if we know right how to distinguish betwixt them, the

   knowledge thereof will afford us no small light towards the true
   understanding of

   the Scripture, and will help us to reconcile all such places, both in
   the Old and

   New Testament, as seem to be repugnant; yea, and it will help us to
   judge aright

   of cases of conscience, and quiet our own conscience in time of trouble
   and

   distress; yea, and we shall thereby be enabled to try the truth and
   falsehood of all

   doctrines; wherefore, for our better instruction on this point, we are
   first of all to

   consider and take notice what the law is, and what the gospel is.

   Now, the law is a doctrine partly known by nature, teaching us that
   there is a

   God, and what God is, and what he requires us to do, binding all
   reasonable

   creatures to perfect obedience, both internal and external, promising
   the favour of

   God, and everlasting life to all those who yield perfect obedience
   thereunto, and

   denouncing the curse of God and everlasting damnation to all those who
   are not

   perfectly correspondent thereunto.

   But the gospel is a doctrine revealed from heaven by the Son of God,
   presently

   after the fall of mankind into sin and death, and afterwards manifested
   more

   clearly and fully to the patriarchs and prophets, to the evangelists
   and apostles,

   and by them spread abroad to others; wherein freedom from sin, from the
   curse

   of the law, the wrath of God, death, and hell, is freely promised for
   Christ's sake

   unto all who truly believe on his name.

   Thirdly, We are to consider what the nature and office of the law is,
   and what the

   nature and office of the gospel is.

   Now, the nature and office of the law is to show unto us our sin, (Rom
   3:10), our

   condemnation, our death, (Rom 2:1, 7:10). But the nature and office of
   the gospel

   is to show unto us, that Christ has taken away our sin, (John 1:29),
   and that he

   also is our redemption and life, (Col 1:14, 3:4). So that the LAW is a
   word of

   wrath, (Rom 4:14); but the GOSPEL is a word of peace, (Eph 2:17).

   Fourthly, We are to consider where we may find the law written, and
   where we

   may find the gospel written.

   Now, we shall find this law and this gospel written and recorded in the
   writings of

   the prophets, evangelists, and apostles, namely, in the books called
   the Old and

   New Testament, or the Scriptures. For, indeed, the law and the gospel
   are the

   chief general heads which comprehend all the doctrine of the
   Scriptures; yet we

   are not to think that these two doctrines are to be distinguished by
   the books and

   leaves of the Scriptures, but by the diversity of God's Spirit speaking
   in them: we

   are not to take and understand whatsoever is contained in the compass
   of the Old

   Testament, to be only and merely the word and voice of the law; neither
   are we

   to think that whatsoever is contained within the compass of the books
   called the

   New Testament, is only and merely the voice of the gospel; for
   sometimes in the

   Old Testament, God does speak comfort, as he comforted Adam, with the
   voice

   of the gospel; sometimes also in the New Testament he does threaten and
   terrify,

   as when Christ terrified the Pharisees. In some places, again, Moses
   and the

   prophets do play the evangelists; insomuch that Hierom doubts whether
   he should

   call Isaiah a prophet or an evangelist. In some places, likewise,
   Christ and the

   apostles supply the part of Moses: Christ himself, until his death, was
   under the

   law, which law he came not to break, but to fulfil; so his sermons made
   to the

   Jews, for the most part, run all upon the perfect doctrine and works of
   the law,

   showing and teaching what we ought to do by the right law of justice,
   and what

   danger ensues in the non-performance of the same. All which places,
   though they

   be contained in the book of the New Testament, yet are they to be
   referred to the

   doctrine of the law, ever having included in them a privy exception of
   repentance

   and faith in Jesus Christ. As for example, where Christ thus preaches,
   "Blessed

   are the pure in heart, for they shall see God," (Matt 5:8). Again,
   "Except ye be

   converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the
   kingdom of

   heaven," (Matt 18:3). And again, "He that doeth the will of my Father
   which is in

   heaven, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven," (Matt 7:21). And
   again, the

   parable of the wicked servant, cast into prison for not forgiving his
   fellow, (Matt

   18:30); the casting of the rich glutton into hell, (Luke 16:23). And
   again, "He that

   denieth me before men, I will deny him before my Father which is in
   heaven,"

   (Luke 12:9); with divers such other places, all which, I say, do
   appertain to the

   doctrine of the law.

   Wherefore, in the fifth place, we are to take heed, when we read the
   Scriptures,

   we do not take the gospel for the law, nor the law for the gospel, but
   labour to

   discern and distinguish the voice of the one from the voice of the
   other; and if we

   would know when the law speaks, and when the gospel speaks, let us
   consider

   and take this for a note, that when in Scripture there is any moral
   work

   commanded to be done, either for eschewing of punishment, or upon
   promise of

   any reward, temporal or eternal--or else when any promise is made with
   the

   condition of any work to be done, which is commanded in the law--there
   is to be

   understood the voice of the law.

   Contrariwise, where the promise of life and salvation is offered unto
   us freely,

   without any condition of any law, either natural, ceremonial, or moral,
   or any

   work done by us, all those places, whether we read them in the Old
   Testament,

   or in the New, are to be referred to the voice and doctrine of the
   gospel; yea, and

   all those promises of Christ coming in the flesh, which we read in the
   Old

   Testament; yea, and all those promises in the New Testament, which
   offer Christ

   upon condition of our believing on his name, are properly called the
   voice of the

   gospel, because they have no condition of our mortifying annexed unto
   them, but

   only faith to apprehend and receive Jesus Christ; as it is written,
   (Rom 3:22), "For

   the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all,
   and upon all

   that believe," &c.

   Briefly, then, if we would know when the law speaks, and when the
   gospel

   speaks, either in reading the word, or in hearing it preached; and if
   we would

   skillfully distinguish the voice of the one from the voice of the
   other, we must

   consider:--

   Law. The law says, "Thou art a sinner, and therefore thou shalt be
   damned,"

   (Rom 7:2, 2 Thess 2:12).

   Gos. But the gospel says, No; "Christ Jesus came into the world to save
   sinners";

   and therefore, "believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
   saved, (1 Tim

   1:15, Acts 16:31).

   Law. Again the law says, "Knowest thou not that the unrighteous shall
   not inherit

   the kingdom of God; be not deceived," &c. (1 Cor 6:9). And therefore
   thou being

   a sinner, and not righteous, shalt not inherit the kingdom of God.

   Gos. But the gospel says, "God has made Christ to be sin for thee who
   knew no

   sin; that thou mightest be made the righteousness of God in him, who is
   the Lord

   thy righteousness," (Jer 23:6).

   Law. Again the law says, "Pay me what thou owest me, or else I will
   cast thee

   into prison," (Matt 18:28,30).

   Gos. But the gospel says, "Christ gave himself a ransom for thee," (1
   Tim 2:6);

   "and so is made redemption unto thee," (1 Cor 1:30).

   Law. Again the law says, "Thou hast not continued in all that I require
   of thee,

   and therefore thou art accursed," (Deut 27:6).

   Gos. But the gospel says, "Christ hath redeemed thee from the curse of
   the law,

   being made a curse for thee," (Gal 3:13).

   Law. Again the law says, "Thou are become guilty before God, and
   therefore

   shalt not escape the judgment of God," (Rom 3:19, 2:3).

   Gos. But the gospel says, "The Father judgeth no man, but hath
   committed all

   judgment to the Son," (John 5:12).

   And now, knowing rightly how to distinguish between the law and the
   gospel, we

   must, in the sixth place, take heed that we break not the orders
   between these

   two in applying the law where the gospel is to be applied, either to
   ourselves or to

   others; for albeit the law and gospel, in order of doctrine, are many
   times to be

   joined together, yet in the case of justification, the law must be
   utterly separated

   from the gospel.

   Therefore, whensoever, or wheresoever, any doubt or question arises of

   salvation, or our justification before God, there the law and all good
   works must

   be utterly excluded and stand apart, that grace may appear free, and
   that the

   promise and faith may stand alone: which faith alone, without law or
   works,

   brings thee in particular to thy justification and salvation, through
   the mere

   promise and free grace of God in Christ; so that I say, in the action
   and office of

   justification, both law and works are to be utterly excluded and
   exempted, as

   things which have nothing to do in that behalf. The reason is this: for
   seeing that

   all our redemption springs out from the body of the Son of God,
   crucified, then is

   there nothing that can stand us in stead, but that only wherewith the
   body of

   Christ is apprehended. Now, forasmuch as neither the law nor works, but
   faith

   only, is the thing which apprehendeth the body and passion of Christ,
   therefore

   faith only is that matter which justifies a man before God, through the
   strength of

   that object Jesus Christ, which it apprehends; like as the brazen
   serpent was the

   object only of the Israelites' looking, and not of their hands'
   working; by the

   strength of which object, through the promise of God, immediately
   proceeded

   health to the beholders: so the body of Christ being the object of our
   faith, strikes

   righteousness to our souls, not through working, but through believing.

   Wherefore, when any person or persons, do feel themselves oppressed or
   terrified

   with the burden of their sins, and feel themselves with the majesty of
   the law and

   judgment of God terrified and oppressed, outweighed and thrown down
   into utter

   discomfort, almost to the pit of hell, as happens sometimes to God's
   own dear

   servants, who have soft and timorous consciences; when such souls, I
   say, do

   read or hear any such place of Scripture which appertains to the law,
   let them,

   then, think and assure themselves that such places do not appertain or
   belong to

   them; nay, let not such only who are thus deeply humbled and terrified
   do this,

   but also let every one that does but make any doubt or question of
   their own

   salvation, through the sight and sense of their sin, do the like.

   And to this end and purpose, let them consider and mark well the end
   why the

   law was given, which was not to bring us to salvation, nor to make us
   good, and

   so to procure God's love and favour towards us: but rather to declare
   and convict

   our wickedness, and make us feel the danger thereof; to this end and
   purpose,

   that we seeing our condemnation, and being in ourselves confounded, may
   be

   driven thereby to have our refuge in the Son of God, in whom alone is
   to be

   found our remedy. And when this is wrought in us, then the law has

   accomplished its end in us; and therefore it is now to give place unto
   Jesus Christ,

   who, as the apostle says, "is the end of the law," (Rom 10:3). Let
   every true

   convicted person, then, who fears the wrath of God, death, and hell,
   when they

   hear or read any such places of Scripture as do appertain to the law,
   not think the

   same to belong to them, no more than a mourning weed belongs to a
   marriage

   feast; and therefore, removing utterly out of their minds all
   cogitations of the law,

   all fear of judgment and condemnation, let them only set before their
   eyes the

   gospel, viz: the glad and joyful tidings of Christ, the sweet comforts
   of God's

   promises, free forgiveness of sins in Christ, grace, redemption,
   liberty, psalms,

   thanks, singing, a paradise of spiritual jocundity, and nothing else;
   thinking thus

   within themselves, the law hath now done its office in me, and
   therefore must

   now give place to its better; that is, it must needs give place to
   Jesus Christ, the

   Son of God, who is my Lord and Master, the fulfiller and accomplisher
   of the

   law.

   Lastly, As we must take heed and beware that we apply not the law where
   the

   gospel is to be applied, so must we also take heed and beware that we
   apply not

   the gospel where the law is to be applied. Let us not apply the gospel
   instead of

   the law; for, as before, the other was even as much as to put on a
   mourning-gown

   at a marriage feast, so this is but even the casting of pearls before
   swine, wherein

   is great abuse amongst many; for commonly it is seen, that these proud,

   self-conceited, and unhumbled persons, these worldly epicures and
   secure

   mammonists, to whom the doctrine of the law does properly appertain, do
   yet

   notwithstanding put it away from them, and bless themselves with the
   sweet

   promises of the gospel, saying, "They hope they have as good a share in
   Christ as

   the best of them all, for God is merciful and the like." And
   contrariwise, the other

   contrite and bruised hearts, to whom belongs not the law, but the
   joyful tidings of

   the gospel, for the most part receive and apply to themselves the
   terrible voice

   and sentence of the law. Whereby it comes to pass, that many do rejoice
   when

   they should mourn; and on the other side, many do fear and mourn when
   they

   should rejoice. Wherefore, to conclude, in private use of life, let
   every person

   discreetly discern between the law and the gospel, and apply to himself
   that which

   belongs to him. Let the man or the woman, who did never yet to any
   purpose

   [especially in the time of health and prosperity] think of, or consider
   their latter

   end, that did never yet fear the wrath of God, nor death, nor devil,
   nor hell, but

   have lived, and do still live a jocund and merry life; let them apply
   the curse of

   the law to themselves, for to them it belongs: yea, and let all your
   civil honest

   men and women, who, it may be, do sometimes think of their latter end,
   and

   have had some kind of fear of the wrath of God, death, and hell, in
   their hearts,

   and yet have salved up the sore, with a plaster made of their own civil

   righteousness, with a salve compounded of their outward conformity to
   the duties

   contained in the law, their freedom from gross sins, and their upright
   and just

   dealing with men; let these hearken to the voice of the law, when it
   says, "Cursed

   is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the
   book of the

   law to do them"; but let all self-denying, fearful, trembling souls,
   apply the

   gracious and sweet promises of God in Christ unto themselves, and
   rejoice

   because their names are written in the Book of Life.

   APPENDIX.

   THE OCCASION OF THE "MARROW" CONTROVERSY, STATED BY

   THE LATE REV. JOHN BROWN, OF HADDINGTON.

   While the Church of Scotland was clear and exact in her standards, and
   many of

   her preachers truly evangelical, a flood of legal doctrine filled many
   pulpits about

   the time of the Revolution.

   The Arminian errors of Professor Simpson were also prevalent after this
   time; but

   the Assembly used him with great tenderness. However, they were far
   from being

   equally kind to such as earnestly endeavoured a clear illustration of
   the doctrines

   of God's free grace reigning through the righteousness of Christ. Mr.
   Hamilton of

   Airth having published a catechetical treatise concerning the covenant
   of works

   and grace, and the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper, in a
   more

   evangelical strain than some wished, the Assembly, 1710, prohibited all
   ministers

   or members of this church to print, or disperse in writ, any catechism,
   without the

   allowance of the Presbytery of the bounds, or the Commission. The
   Presbytery

   of Auchterarder having begun to require candidates for licence, to
   acknowledge it

   unsound to teach that men must forsake their sins in order to come to
   Christ,

   the Assembly, 1717, on the same day they had dealt so gently with
   Professor

   Simpson, declared their abhorrence of that proposition as unsound and
   most

   detestable--as if men ought only to come to Christ, the alone Saviour
   from sins,

   after they have got rid of them by repentance. Mr. James Hog, one of
   the holiest

   ministers in the kingdom, having published or recommended a celebrated
   and

   edifying tract of the Cromwellian age, called The Marrow Modern
   Divinity, the

   Assembly, 1720, fell upon it with great fury, as if it had been replete
   with

   Antinomian errors, though it is believed many of these zealots never
   read it, at

   least had never perused it, in connection with the Second Part of it,
   which is

   wholly taken up in the manifestation of the obligation, meaning, and
   advantage of

   observing the law of God. They condemned the offering of Christ, as a
   Saviour to

   all men, or to sinners as such, and the doctrine of believers' full
   deliverance from

   under the law as a broken covenant of works. They asserted men's
   holiness to be

   a federal or conditional mean of their obtaining eternal happiness.
   They

   condemned these almost express declarations of Scripture, that
   believers are not

   under the law,--that they do not commit sin,--that the Lord sees no sin
   in them,

   and cannot be angry with them, as Antinomian paradoxes,--and condemned
   the

   distinction of the moral law as a covenant of works, and as a binding
   rule of duty

   in the hand of Christ. In order to explain these expressions, Messrs.
   James Hog,

   Thomas Boston, Ebenezer and Ralph Erskines, Gabriel Watson, and seven

   others, remonstrated to the next Assembly against these decisions as
   injurious to

   the doctrine of God's grace. And in their answers to the Commission's
   Twelve

   Queries, they illustrated these doctrines with no small clearness and
   evidence.

   Perhaps influenced by this, as well as by the wide spread detestation
   of their acts

   [1720] on that point, the Assembly, 1722, reconsidered the same, and
   made an

   act explaining and confirming them. This was less gross and erroneous.

   Nevertheless, the twelve representers protested against it as injurious
   to truth; but

   this protest was not allowed to be marked. The Moderator, by the
   Assembly's

   appointment, rebuked them for their reflections on the Assembly, 1720,
   in their

   representation, and admonished them to beware of the like in all time
   coming;

   against which they protested.

   QUERIES AGREED UNTO BY THE COMMISSION OF THE GENERAL

   ASSEMBLY, AND PUT TO THOSE MINISTERS WHO GAVE IN A

   REPRESENTATION AND PETITION AGAINST THE 5TH AND 8TH

   ACTS OF ASSEMBLY 1720, WITH THE ANSWERS GIVEN BY THESE

   MINISTERS TO THE SAID QUERIES. [381]

   Adhering to and holding, as here repeated, our subscribed Answer given
   in to the

   Reverend Commission, when by them called to receive these Queries, we
   come

   to adventure, under the conduct of the faithful and true Witness, who
   has

   promised the Spirit of truth to lead his people into truth, to make
   answer to the

   said Queries. To which, before we proceed, we crave leave to represent,
   that the

   title thereto prefixed, viz: "Queries to be put to Mr. James Hog, and
   other

   Ministers, who gave in a Representation in Favours of the Marrow, to
   the General

   Assembly, 1721," as well as that prefixed to the Commission's overture
   anent this

   affair, has a native tendency to divert and bemist the reader, to
   expose us, and to

   turn the matter off its proper hinge, by giving a wrong colour to our

   Representation, as if the chief design of it was to plead, not for the
   precious truths

   of the gospel, which we conceive to be wounded by the condemnatory act,
   but

   for "The Marrow of Modern Divinity," the which, though we value for a
   good

   and useful book, and doubt not but the Church of God may be much
   edified by

   it, as we ourselves have been, yet came it never into our minds to hold
   it, or any

   other private writing, faultless, nor to put it on a level with our
   approved

   standards of doctrine.

   QUERY. I.--Whether are there any precepts in the gospel that were not

   actually given before the gospel was revealed?

   Answer.--The passages in our representation, marked out to us for the
   grounds

   of this query, are these:--"The gospel doctrine, known only by a new
   revelation

   after the fall. Of the same dismal tendency we apprehend to be the
   declaring of

   that distinction of the law, as it is the law of works, and as it is
   the law of Christ,

   as the author applies it, to be altogether groundless. The erroneous
   doctrine of

   justification, for something wrought in, or done by the sinner, as his

   righteousness, or keeping the new and gospel law." Now, leaving it to
   others to

   judge if these passages gave any just occasion to this question, we
   answer,--

   1st, In the gospel, taken strictly, and as contradistinct from the law,
   for a doctrine

   of grace, or good news from heaven, or help in God through Jesus
   Christ, to lost

   self-destroying creatures of Adam's race, or the glad tidings of a
   Saviour, with life

   and salvation in him to the chief of sinners, there are no precepts;
   all these, the

   command to believe, and repent, not excepted, belonging to, and flowing
   from the

   law, which fastens the new duty on us, the same moment the gospel
   reveals the

   new object.

   That in the gospel, taken strictly, there are no precepts, to us seems
   evident from

   the holy Scriptures. In the first revelation of it, made in theses
   words,--"The seed

   of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent," we find no precept,
   but a

   promise containing glad tidings of a Saviour, with grace, mercy, life,
   and salvation

   in him, to lost sinners of Adam's family. And the gospel preached unto
   Abraham,

   namely, "In thee," i.e., in thy seed, which is in Christ, "shall all
   nations be

   blessed," is of the same nature. The good tidings of great joy to all
   people of a

   Saviour born in the city of David, who is Christ the Lord, brought and
   proclaimed

   from heaven by the angels, we take to have been the gospel, strictly
   and properly

   so called; yet is there no precept in these tidings. We find, likewise,
   the gospel of

   peace and glad tidings of good things are in Scripture convertible
   terms; and the

   word of the gospel, which Peter spoke to the Gentiles, that they might
   believe,

   was no other than peace by Jesus Christ, crucified, risen, and exalted
   to be Judge

   of quick and dead, with remission of sins through his name, to be
   received by

   every one believing in him. Much more might be added on this head,
   which, that

   we be not tedious, we pass. Of the same mind, as to this point, we find
   the body

   of reformed divines, as to instance in a few, Calvin, Chamier, Pemble,
   Wendelin,

   Alting, the professors of Leyden, Witsius, Maestrick, Maresius,
   Troughton,

   Essenius.

   That all precepts, [those of faith and repentance not excepted,] belong
   to, and are

   of the law, is no less evident to us; for the law of creation, or of
   the ten

   commandments, which was given to Adam in paradise, in the form of a
   covenant

   of works, requiring us to believe whatever God should reveal or
   promise, and to

   obey whatever he should command; all precepts whatsoever must be
   virtually and

   really included in it. So that there never was, nor can be, an instance
   of duty

   owing by the creature to God, not commanded in the moral law, if not
   directly

   and expressly, yet indirectly, and by consequence. The same first
   commandment,

   for instance, which requires us to take the Lord for our God, to
   acknowledge his

   essential verity, and sovereign authority; to love, fear, and trust in
   Jehovah, after

   what manner soever he shall be pleased to reveal himself to us, and
   likewise to

   grieve and mourn for his dishonour or displeasure, requires believing
   in Jehovah,

   our righteousness, as soon as ever he is revealed to us as such, and
   sorrowing

   after a godly sort for the transgression of his holy law, whether by
   one's self or by

   others. It is true, Adam was not actually obliged to believe in a
   Saviour, till, being

   lost and undone, a Saviour was revealed to him; but the same
   commandment that

   bound him to trust and depend on, and to believe the promises of God
   Creator,

   no doubt obliged him to believe in God Redeemer, when revealed. Nor was
   Adam

   obliged to sorrow for sin ere it was committed. But this same law that
   bound him

   to have a sense of the evil of sin in its nature and effects, to hate,
   loathe, and flee

   from sin, and to resolve against it, and for all holy obedience, and to
   have a due

   apprehension of the goodness of God, obliged him also to mourn for it,
   whenever

   it should fall out. And we cannot see how the contrary doctrine is
   consistent with

   the perfection of the law; for if the law be a complete rule of all
   moral, internal

   and spiritual, as well as external and ritual obedience, it must
   require faith and

   repentance, as well as it does all other good works. And that it does
   indeed

   require them, we can have no doubt of, when we consider, that without
   them all

   other religious performances are, in God's account, as good as nothing;
   and that

   sin being, as the Scripture and our own standard tell us, any want of
   conformity

   to, or transgression of the law of God, unbelief and impenitency must
   be so too.

   And if they be so, then must faith and repentance be obedience and
   conformity of

   the same law, which the former are a transgression of, or an
   inconformity unto;

   unbelief particularly being a departing from the living God, is, for
   certain,

   forbidden in the first commandment, therefore faith must needs be
   required in the

   same commandment, according to a known rule. But what need we more,
   after

   our Lord has told us, that faith is one of the weightier matters of the
   law? and that

   it is not a second table duty which is there meant, is evident to us,
   by comparing

   the parallel place in Luke, where, in place of faith, we have the love
   of God. As

   for repentance, in case of sin against God, it becomes naturally a
   duty; and

   though neither the covenant of works nor of grace admitted of it, as
   any expiation

   of sin, or federal condition giving right to life, it is a duty
   included in every

   commandment, on the supposal of a transgression.

   What moves us to be the more concerned for this point of doctrine is,
   that if the

   law does not bind sinners to believe and repent, then we see not how
   faith and

   repentance, considered as works, are excluded from our justification
   before God,

   since in that case they are not works of the law, under which character
   all works

   are in Scripture excluded from the use of justifying in the sight of
   God. And we

   can call to mind that, on the contrary doctrine, Arminius laid the
   foundation of his

   rotten principles, touching sufficient grace, or rather natural power.
   "Adam," says

   he, "had not power to believe in Jesus Christ, because he needed him
   not; nor

   was he bound to believe, because the law required it not. Therefore,
   since Adam

   by his fall did not lose it, God is bound to give every man power to
   believe in

   Jesus Christ." And Socinians, Arminians, Papists, and Baxterians, by
   holding the

   gospel to be a new, proper, preceptive law, with sanction, and thereby
   turning it

   into a real, though milder covenant of works, have confounded the law
   and the

   gospel, and brought works into the matter and cause of a sinner's
   justification

   before God. And, we reckon, we are the rather called to be on our guard
   here,

   that the clause in our representation, making mention of the new, or
   gospel law, is

   marked out to us, as one of the grounds of this query, which we own to
   be

   somewhat alarming. Besides all this, the teaching that faith and
   repentance are

   gospel commandments, may yet again open the door to Antinomianism, as
   it

   sometimes did already, if we may believe Mr. Cross, who says, "History
   tells us

   that it sprung from such a mistake, that faith and repentance were
   taught and

   commanded by the gospel only, and that as they contained all necessary
   to

   salvation, so the law was needless."

   On this head also, namely, that all precepts belong to the law, we
   might likewise

   adduce a cloud of witnesses beyond exception, such as Pemble, Essenius,
   Anth,

   Burgess, Rutherford, Owen, Witsius, Dickson, Fergusson, Troughton,
   Larger

   Catechism on the duties required, and sins forbidden in the first
   commandment.

   But, without insisting further, we answer,--

   2dly, In the gospel, taken largely for the whole doctrine of Christ and
   the apostles,

   contained in the New Testament, or for a system of all the promises,
   precepts,

   threatenings, doctrines, histories, that any way concern man's recovery
   and

   salvation, in which respect, not only all the ten commandments, but the
   doctrine

   of the covenant of works belong to it, but in this sense, the doctrine
   is not

   contradistinct from the law;--in the gospel, taken thus at large, we
   say, there are

   doubtless many precepts that were not actually given [that is,
   particularly and

   expressly promulgated or required] before the gospel was revealed. Love
   to our

   enemies, to instance in a few of many, mercy to the miserable, bearing
   of the

   cross, hope and joy in tribulations, in prospect of their having a
   desired issue,

   love, thankfulness, prayer, and obedience to a God Redeemer, zealous
   witnessing

   against sin, and for truth, in case of defection from the faith or
   holiness of the

   gospel, confessing our faults to and forgiving one another. All the
   ceremonial

   precepts under the Old Testament together with the institutions of
   Christ under

   the New, faith in Jesus Christ, repentance unto life, with many more,
   to say

   nothing of personal and particular precepts, were not actually given
   before the

   gospel was revealed; all which are nevertheless reducible to the law of
   the ten

   commandments, many of them being plain duties of the law of nature,
   though

   they had no due and proper objects, nor occasions of being exercised in
   an

   innocent state. It is true, there are many of them we had never heard
   of, without

   the gospel had been revealed; yet are they not, therefore, in any
   proper sense,

   precepts of the gospel, but of the law, which is exceeding broad,
   extending to new

   objects, occasions, and circumstances. The law says one thing to the
   person

   unmarried, and another thing to the same person when married; one thing
   to him

   as a child, another thing to him as a parent, &c., yet is it the same
   law still. The

   law of God being perfect, and like unto its Author, must reach to every
   condition

   of the creature; but if for every new duty or new object of faith there
   behoved to

   be a new law, how strangely must laws be multiplied! The law itself
   [even as in

   the case of a man] may meet with any changes, and yet remain the same
   as to its

   essence. Now, as to faith and repentance, though ability to exercise
   them, and

   acceptance of them, be by the gospel, yet it is evident they must be
   regulated by

   the same law, the transgression of which made them necessary. The
   essence of

   repentance, it is plain, lies in repeating and renewing, with a
   suitable frame of

   spirit, the duties omitted, or in observing the law one had violated.
   For as the

   divine perfections are the rule and pattern of God's image in man, as
   well in his

   regeneration as in his creation, so the holy law of God is the rule of
   our

   repentance, as well as of our primitive obedience. And why faith, when
   it has

   God Mediator, or God Redeemer, for its object, may not be from the same
   law as

   when it had God Creator, or God Preserver for its objects, we cannot
   see.

   QUERY II.--Is not the believer now bound, by the authority of the
   Creator, to

   personal obedience to the moral law, though not in order to
   justification?

   Ans.--What is given us for the ground of this query, is the following
   clause of our

   representation, viz:--"Since believers are not under it, to be thereby
   justified or

   condemned, we cannot comprehend how it continues any longer a covenant
   of

   works to them, or as such to have a commanding power over them, that
   covenant

   form of it being done away in Christ with respect to believers." This
   clause of the

   representation being so much one, even in words, with our Confession,
   we could

   never have expected the Reverend Commission would have moved a query
   upon

   it; but since they have been pleased to think otherwise, we answer

   affirmatively:--

   The believer, since he ceases not to be a creature by being made a new
   creature,

   is, and must ever be bound to personal obedience to the law of the ten

   commandments, by the authority of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his
   Creator.

   But his authority is, as to him, issued by and from the Lord Jesus
   Christ, at

   whose mouth he receives the law, being as well his Lord God Creator, as
   his Lord

   God Redeemer, and having all the fullness of the Godhead dwelling in
   him; nor

   can nor will the sinful creature ever apply himself to obedience
   acceptable to God,

   or comfortable to himself, without the Creator's authority come to him
   in that

   channel.

   We are clear and full of the same mind with our Confession, that the
   moral law of

   the ten commandments does for ever bind all, as well justified persons
   as others,

   to the obedience thereof, not only in regard of the matter contained in
   it, but also

   in respect of the authority of God the Creator who gave it, and that
   Christ does

   not in the gospel any way dissolve, but much strengthen this
   obligation; for how

   can it lose anything of its original authority, by being conveyed to
   the believer in

   such a sweet and blessed channel as the hand of Christ, since both he
   himself is

   the supreme God and Creator, and since the authority, majesty, and
   sovereignty

   of the Father is in his Son, he being the same in substance, equal in
   power and

   glory? "Beware of Him," says the Lord unto Israel, concerning Christ
   the angel of

   the covenant, "and obey his voice, provoke him not: for my name is in
   him." That

   is, as we understand it, my authority, sovereignty, and other adorable

   excellencies, yea the whole fullness of the Godhead is in him, and in
   him only will

   I be served and obeyed. And then it follows, "But if thou shalt indeed
   obey his

   voice, and do all that I speak." The name of the Father is so in him;
   he is so of

   the same nature with his Father, that his voice is the Father's voice:
   "If thou obey

   his voice, and do all that I speak."

   We desire to think and speak honourably of Him, whose name is
   "Wonderful,

   Counselllor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, and the Prince of
   Peace."

   And it cannot but exceedingly grate our ears, and grieve our spirits,
   to find such

   doctrines or positions vented in this Church, especially at a time when
   the Arian

   heresy is so prevalent in our neighbour nations, as have an obvious
   tendency to

   darken and disparage his divine glory and authority, as that, if a
   believer ought not

   to receive the law of the ten commandments at the hand of God, as he is
   Creator

   out of Christ, then he is not under its obligation, as it was delivered
   by God the

   Creator, but is loosed from all obedience to it, as it was enacted by
   the authority

   of the Lord Creator; and that it is injurious to the infinite majesty
   of the Sovereign

   Lord Creator, and to the honour of his holy law, to restrict the
   believer to receive

   the ten commandments only at the hand of Christ. What can be more
   injurious to

   the infinite majesty of the sovereign Lord Redeemer; by whom all things
   were

   created that are in heaven and in earth, visible and invisible, whether
   they be

   thrones or dominions, principalities or powers, than to speak as if the
   Creator's

   authority was not in him, or as if the receiving the Creator's law from
   Christ did

   loose men from obedience to it, as enacted by the authority of the
   Father? Woe

   unto us, if this doctrine be the truth, for so should we be brought
   back to

   consuming fire indeed; for, out of Christ, "He that made us will have
   no mercy

   upon us; nor will he that formed us show us any favour." We humbly
   conceive,

   the Father does not reckon himself glorified, but contemned by
   Christians offering

   obedience to him as Creator out of Christ. Nor does the offering to
   deal with him

   after this sort, or to teach others so, discover a due regard to the
   mystery of

   Christ revealed in the gospel; for it is the will of the Father, the
   Sovereign Lord

   Creator, that all men should honour the Son, even as they honour
   himself; and

   that at, or in the name of Jesus every knee should bow; and that every
   tongue

   should confess Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father,
   who having in

   these last days spoken unto us by his Son, by whom also he made the
   worlds,

   and with an audible voice from heaven has said, "This is my beloved Son
   in

   whom I am well pleased hear ye him." Were it not we would be thought
   tedious,

   Perkins, Durham, Owen, and others, might have been heard on this head.
   But we

   proceed to--

   QUERY III.--Doth the annexing of a promise of life, and a threatening
   of

   death to a precept, make it a covenant of works?

   We answer, as in our representation, That the promise of life, and
   threatening of

   death, superadded to the law of the Creator, made it a covenant of
   works to our

   first parents, proposed; and their own consent, which sinless creatures
   could not

   refuse, made it a covenant of works accepted. "A law," say the
   judicious

   Durham, "doth necessarily imply no more than, first, to direct;
   secondly, to

   command, enforcing that obedience by authority. A covenant doth further

   necessarily imply promises made upon some conditions, or threatenings
   added if

   such a condition be not performed. Now, says he, this law may be
   considered

   without the consideration of a covenant; for it was free to God to have
   added or

   not to have added promises; and the threatenings, upon supposition the
   law had

   been kept, might never have taken effect." From whence it is plain, in
   the

   judgment of this great divine, the law of nature was turned into a
   covenant by the

   addition of a promise of life and threatening of death. Of the same
   mind is

   Burgess and the London ministers, Vindicie Legis, page 61. "There are
   only two

   things which go to the essence of a law, and that is--1st, direction;
   2d, obligation.

   First, direction: therefore a law is a rule: hence the law of God is
   compared to

   light. Second, obligation; for therein lieth the essence of sin that it
   breaketh this

   law, which supposes the obligatory force of it. In the next place,
   there are two

   consequents of the law, which are ad bene esse, that the law may be the
   better

   obeyed; and this indeed turneth the law into a covenant. First the
   sanction of it by

   way of promise; that is a mere free thing: God, by reason of that
   dominion which

   he had over man, might have commanded his obedience, and yet never made
   a

   promise of eternal life unto him. And, secondly, as for the other
   consequent act of

   the law, to curse and punish, this is but an accidental act, not
   necessary to a law,

   for it comes in upon supposition of transgression. A law is a complete
   law,

   obliging, though it do not actually curse; as in the confirmed angels
   it never laid

   any more than obligatory and mandatory acts upon them; for that they
   were

   under a law is plain, because otherwise they could not have sinned, for
   where

   there is no law, there is no transgression."

   Though there is no ground from our representation to add more on this
   head, yet

   we may say, that a promise of life made to a precept of doing,--that
   is, in

   consideration or upon condition of one's doing, be the doing more or
   less, it is all

   one, the divine will in the precept being the rule in this case, is a
   covenant of

   works. And as to believers in Christ, though in the gospel, largely
   taken, we own

   there are promises of life, and threatenings of death, as well as
   precepts; and that

   godliness hath the promise, not only of this life, but of that which is
   to come,

   annexed to it, in the order of the covenant: yet we are clear no
   promise of life is

   made to the performance of precepts, nor eternal death threatened in
   case of their

   failings whatsoever in performing, else should their title to life be
   founded not

   entirely on Christ and his righteousness imputed to them, but on
   something in or

   done by themselves; and their after sins should again actually bring
   them under

   vindictive wrath and the curse of the law; which, upon their union with
   Christ

   who was made a curse for them, to redeem them from under it, they are,

   according to Scripture and our Confession, for ever delivered from.
   Hence we

   know of no sanction the law, standing in the covenant of grace hath
   with respect

   to believers besides gracious rewards, all of them freely promised on
   Christ's

   account for their encouragement in obedience, and fatherly chastisement
   and

   displeasure, in case of their not walking in his commandments; which to
   a believer

   are no less awful and much more powerful restraints from sin than the
   prospect

   of the curse and hell itself would be. The Reverend Commission will
   not, we

   hope, grudge to hear that eminent divine, Mr. Perkins, in a few words,
   on this

   head, who having put the objection, "In the gospel there are promises
   of life upon

   condition of our obedience, as Romans 8:13, 'If ye through the
   Spirit,'" &c.;

   answers, "The promises of the gospel are not made to the work, but to
   the

   worker; and to the worker, not for his work, but for Christ's sake
   according to his

   work: e.g., The promise of life is not made to the work of
   mortification, but to

   him that mortifies his flesh; and that not for his mortification, but
   because he is in

   Christ, and his mortification is the token and evidence thereof." This,
   as it is the

   Old Protestant doctrine, so we take it to be the truth. And as to the
   believer's total

   and final freedom from the curse of the law upon his union with Christ,

   Protestant divines, particularly Rutherford and Owen, throughout their
   writings,

   are full and clear on this head.

   QUERY IV.--If the moral law, antecedent to its receiving the form of a

   covenant of works, had a threatening of hell annexed?

   Ans.--Since the law of God never was, nor will ever in this world be
   the stated

   rule, either of man's duty towards God, or of God's dealing with man,
   but as it

   stands in one of the two covenants of works and grace, we are at a loss
   to

   discover the real usefulness of this query, as well as what foundation
   it has in our

   representation.

   As to the intrinsical demerit of sin, we are clear, whether there had
   ever been any

   covenant of works or not, it deserves hell, even all that an infinitely
   holy and just

   God ever has or shall inflict for it; yet what behoved to have been the
   Creator's

   disposal of the creature, in the supposed event of sin's entering,
   without a

   covenant being made, we incline not here to dip into; but we reckon it
   is not

   possible to prove a threatening of hell to be inseparable from the law
   of creation,

   the obligation of which, because resulting from the nature of God, and
   of the

   creature, is eternal and immutable: for confirmed angels, glorified
   saints, yea, and

   the human nature of Christ, are all of them naturally, necessarily, and
   eternally

   obliged to love, obey, depend on, and submit unto God, and to make him
   their

   blessedness and ultimate end; but none, we conceive, will be peremptory
   in

   saying, they have a threatening of hell annexed to the law they are
   under. And we

   can by no means allow, that a believer, delivered by Christ from the
   covenant of

   works, is still obnoxious, upon every new transgression, to the
   threatening of hell,

   supposed to be inseparably annexed to the law of creation, or of the
   ten

   commandments; which law every reasonable creature must for ever be
   under,

   since this would, in effect, be no other than, after he is delivered
   from hell in one

   respect, to bind him over to it in another. Whatever threatening one
   may suppose

   belonged to the moral law of the ten commandments, antecedently to its
   receiving

   a covenant form, all was, for certain, included in the sanction of the
   covenant of

   works: so that Christ, in bearing the curse of it, redeemed believers
   from the hell,

   vindictive wrath and curse, their sins in any sort deserved; the
   hand-writing that

   was against them he cancelled, tore to pieces, and nailed to his cross.
   Hence the

   threatening of hell and the curse are actually separated from the law
   of the ten

   commandments, which believers are under as a rule of life; and to hold
   otherwise

   is the leading error, yea, the very spring and fountain-head of
   Antinomianism; on

   all which, Burgess, Rutherford, and others, may be heard.

   QUERY V.--If it be peculiar to believers to be free of the commanding
   power

   of the law, as a covenant of works?

   Though our saying we cannot comprehend how the covenant of works, as
   such,

   continues to have a commanding power over believers, that covenant form
   of it

   being done away in Christ with respect to them, gives no sufficient
   foundation to

   this query, since we affirm nothing concerning any but believers, whose
   freedom

   from the commanding power of that covenant, the query seems, as much as
   we

   do, to allow of; we answer affirmatively: for, since it is only to
   believers the Spirit

   of God in Scripture says, "Ye are not under the law," the main import
   of which

   phrase is, subjection to the commanding power of it, as a
   covenant,--"but under

   grace"; and since they only are, by virtue of their union with Christ,
   actually freed

   from being under the law, by Christ's being made under it, i.e., under
   its

   command, as above, as well as under its curse for them; and since
   according to

   our Confession, it is the peculiar privilege of believers, which,
   therefore, believers

   have no interest in, not to be under the law as a covenant of works, to
   be justified

   or condemned thereby, we can allow no other, besides believers, to be
   invested

   with that immunity.

   All unbelievers within, as well as without, the pale of the visible
   church, since

   they seek righteousness only by the works of the law, and are strangers
   to the

   covenant of grace, we always took to be debtors to the whole law, in
   their own

   persons. And this their obligation, under the DO, or commanding power
   of that

   covenant, we took to be inviolably firm, till such time as by faith
   they had

   recourse to him who is "the end of the law for righteousness to every
   one that

   believeth"; else we thought, and do still think, if their obligation to
   the command

   of that covenant be dissolved, merely by their living under an external
   gospel

   dispensation, they would be cast quite loose from being under any
   covenant at all,

   contrary to the common received doctrine of the Protestant churches,
   namely,

   that every person whatsoever is in and under one or other of the two
   covenants

   of works and grace; nor could they, unless they be under the commanding
   power

   of the covenant of works, be ever found transgressors of the law of
   that

   covenant, by any actual sin of their own, nor be bound over anew under
   the

   covenant-curse thereby.

   The covenant of works, it is true, is, by the fall, weak and
   ineffectual, as a

   covenant, to give us life, by reason of our weakness and disability to
   fulfil it,

   being antecedently sinners, and obnoxious to its curse, which no person
   can be,

   and yet at the same time have a right unto its promise. Hence, for any
   to seek life

   and salvation by it now, is no other than to labour after an
   impossibility; yet does

   it nevertheless continue in full force, as a law requiring of all
   sinners, while they

   continue in their natural state, without taking hold, by faith, of
   Christ and the

   grace of the new covenant; requiring of them, we say, personal and
   absolutely

   perfect obedience, and threatening death upon every the least
   transgression. From

   the commanding power of which law, requiring universal holiness in such
   rigour,

   as that, on the least failure in substance, circumstance, or degree,
   all is rejected,

   and we are determined transgressors of the whole law; believers, and
   they only,

   are freed, as we said above. "But to suppose a person," says Dr. Owen,
   "by any

   means freed from the curse due unto sin, and then to deny that, upon
   the

   performance of the perfect sinless obedience which the law requires, he
   should

   have right to the promise of life thereby, is to deny the truth of God,
   and to

   reflect dishonour upon his justice. Our Lord himself was justified by
   the law; and

   it is immutably true, that he who does the things of it, shall live in
   them." "It is

   true," adds the same author, "that God did never formally and
   absolutely renew,

   or give again this law, as a covenant of works, a second time; nor was
   there any

   need that so he should do, unless it were declaratively only. And so it
   was

   renewed at Sinai; for the whole of it being an emanation of eternal
   right and truth,

   it abides, and must abide in full force for ever. Wherefore, it is only
   so far broken

   as a covenant, that all mankind having sinned against the command of
   it, and so

   by guilt, with the impotency to obedience, which ensued thereupon,
   defeated

   themselves of any interest in its promise, and possibility of attaining
   any such

   interest, they cannot have any benefit by it. But as to its power to
   oblige all

   mankind unto obedience, and the unchangeable truths of its promises and

   threatenings, it abides the same as it was from the beginning. The
   introducing of

   another covenant, [adds he again on the same head,] inconsistent with,
   and

   contrary to it, does not instantly free men from the law as a covenant;
   for, though

   a new law abrogates a former law inconsistent with it, and frees all
   from

   obedience, it is not so in a covenant, which operates not by sovereign
   authority,

   but becomes a covenant by consent of them with whom it is made. So
   there is no

   freedom from the old covenant, by the constitution of the new, till it
   be actually

   complied with. In Adam's covenant we must abide under obligation to
   duty and

   punishment, till by faith we be interested in the new."

   From all which it appears to be no cogent reasoning to say, if the
   unbeliever be

   under the commanding power of the covenant of works, then would he be
   under

   two opposite commands at once, viz: to seek a perfect righteousness in
   his own

   person, and to seek it also by faith in a surety; for, though the law
   requires of us

   now, both active and passive righteousness in our own persons, and
   likewise,

   upon the revelation of Jesus Christ in the gospel, as Jehovah our
   righteousness,

   obliges us to believe in and submit to him as such, yet, as it is in
   many other cases

   of duties, the law requires both these of us, not in sensu composito,
   as they say,

   but in sensu diviso. The law is content to sustain and hold for good
   the payment

   of a responsible surety, though itself provides none; and wills us,
   being insolvent

   of ourselves, cheerfully, thankfully, and without delay, to accept of
   the non-such

   favour offered unto us. But till the sinner, convinced of his
   undoneness otherwise,

   accept of, use, and plead that benefit in his own behalf, the law will,
   and does go

   on in its just demands and diligence against him. Having never had
   pleasure in the

   sinful creature, by reason of our unfaithfulness, it can easily admit
   of the marriage

   to another husband, upon a lawful divorce, after fair count and
   reckoning, and full

   satisfaction and reparation made for all the invasions upon, and
   violations of the

   first husband's honour; but, when the sinner, unwilling to hear of any
   such

   motion, still cleaves to the law, its first husband, what wonder the
   law, in that

   case, go on to use the sinner as he deserves? In short, this pretended
   absurdity, at

   worst, amounts to no more than this,--Make full payment yourself, or
   find me

   good and sufficient payment by a surety, till which time I will
   continue to proceed

   against you, without mitigation or mercy. Wherefore, the unbeliever is
   justly

   condemned by the law, both because he did not continue in all things
   written in

   the book of the law to do them, and because he did not believe on the
   name of

   the Son of God.

   QUERY VI.--If a sinner, being justified, has all things at once that
   are

   necessary for salvation? And if personal holiness, and progress in holy

   obedience, is not necessary to a justified person's possession of
   glory, in case of

   his continuing in life after his justification?

   Ans.--The ground of this query, marked out to us, is, in these words of
   holy

   Luther,--"For in Christ I have all things at once, neither need I
   anything more,

   that is necessary unto salvation." And to us it is evident, that this
   is the believer's

   plea, viz: Christ's most perfect obedience to the law, for him, in
   answer unto its

   demand of good works for obtaining salvation, according to the tenor of
   the first

   covenant, which plea the representation alleges to be cut off and
   condemned by

   the Act of Assembly, But, without saying any thing of the old Popish
   reflection on

   the doctrine of free justification by faith, without works, as it was
   taught by

   Luther and other reformers, or the hardship of having this question put
   to us, as if

   we had given ground of being suspected for enemies to gospel holiness,
   which our

   consciences bear us witness, is our great desire to have advanced in
   ourselves and

   others, as being fully persuaded, that without it neither they nor we
   shall see the

   Lord; we answer to the first part of the query--

   That, since a justified person, being passed from death to life,
   translated from the

   power of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son, and blest with
   all the

   spiritual blessings in Christ, is, by virtue of his union with him,
   brought into and

   secured in a state of salvation; and therefore, in the language of the
   Holy Ghost,

   actually, though not completely, saved already; and since, in him, he
   has

   particularly a most perfect, law-binding, and law-magnifying
   righteousness,

   redemption in his blood, even the forgiveness of sins, peace with God,
   access,

   acceptance, wisdom, sanctification, everlasting strength, and, in one
   word, an

   over-flowing, ever-flowing fullness, from which, according to the order
   of the

   covenant, he does, and shall receive whatever he wants; hence,
   according to the

   Scripture, in Christ all things are his and in him he is complete.
   Considering, we

   say, these things, we think a justified person has in Christ at once
   all things

   necessary to salvation, though of himself he has nothing.

   To the second part of the query we answer, that personal holiness, and

   justification, being inseparable in the believer, we are unwilling, so
   much as the

   query does, to suppose their separation. Personal holiness we reckon so
   necessary

   to the possession of glory, or to a state of perfect holiness and
   happiness, as is the

   morning light to the noon- day warmth and brightness,--as is a
   reasonable soul to

   a wise, healthy, strong, and full grown man,--as an antecedent is to
   its

   consequent,--as a part is to the whole; for the difference betwixt a
   state of grace

   and of glory, we take to be gradual only, according to the usual
   saying, "Grace is

   glory begun, and glory grace in perfection." So necessary, again, as
   motion is to

   evidence life, or in order to walking, not only habitual, but actual
   holiness and

   progress in holy obedience, one continuing in life, we are clear, are
   so necessary,

   that without the same none can see the Lord. And as it is not only the
   believer's

   interest, but his necessary and indispensable duty, to be still going
   on "from

   strength to strength, until he appear before the Lord in Zion"; so the
   righteous, we

   believe, "will hold on his way, and he who is of clean hands will grow
   stronger

   and stronger": for though the believer's progress in holy obedience, by
   reason of

   the many stops, interruptions, and assaults he frequently meets with
   from Satan,

   the world, and in-dwelling corruption, is far from being alike at all
   times, yet "the

   path of the just," though he frequently fall, will be "as the shining
   light, that

   shineth more and more unto the perfect day." Though he may, at times
   "become

   weary and faint in his mind," yet shall he, by waiting on the Lord,
   "renew his

   strength, and mount up as with eagles' wings," &c. But still the
   believer has all

   this in and from Christ: for whence can our progress in holiness come,
   but from

   the supply of his Spirit? Our walking in holy obedience, and every good
   motion of

   ours, must be in him, and from him, who is the Way and the Life, who is
   our

   head of influences, and the fountain of our strength, and who "works in
   us both

   to will and to do." "Abide in me," says he, "and I in you. For without
   me ye can

   do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and
   is

   withered."

   But if the meaning of the query be, of such a necessity of holy
   obedience, in

   order to the possession of glory, as imports any kind of causality, we
   dare not

   answer in the affirmative; for we cannot look on personal holiness, or
   good

   works, as properly federal and conditional means of obtaining the
   possession of

   heaven, though we own they are necessary to make us meet for it.

   QUERY VII.--Is preaching the necessity of a holy life, in order to the

   obtaining of eternal happiness, of dangerous consequence to the
   doctrine of free

   grace?

   Ans.--The last of the two clauses of the eighth act of Assembly, being

   complained of in the representation, is the first and main ground of
   this query.

   And ere we make answer to it, we crave leave to explain ourselves more
   fully as

   to the offence we conceive to be given by that act; namely, that, in
   opposition to,

   and in place of the believer's plea of Christ's active righteousness,
   in answer to the

   law, demanding good works, for obtaining salvation according to the
   tenor of the

   first covenant, cut off, as we apprehend, by the fifth act; ministers
   are ordered, in

   the eighth act, to preach the necessity of our own personal holiness,
   in order to

   the obtaining of everlasting happiness. As also, that our inherent
   holiness seems to

   be put too much on the same foot, in point of necessity, for obtaining
   everlasting

   happiness, with justification by the Surety; which the frame of the
   words, being

   as follows, will well admit, viz: "Of free justification through our
   blessed Surety,

   the Lord Jesus Christ, received by faith alone; and of the necessity of
   an holy life,

   in order to the obtaining of everlasting happiness." Moreover, that the
   great

   fundamental of justification is laid down in such general terms, as
   adversaries will

   easily agree to, without mention of the Surety's righteousness, active
   or passive,

   or the imputation of either; especially since a motion in open Assembly
   for adding

   the few, but momentous words,--imputed righteousness, was slighted.
   And,

   finally, that that act is so little adapted to the end it is now given
   out to have been

   designed for, viz:--a testimony to the supreme Godhead of our glorious
   God and

   Saviour Jesus Christ, and against Arianism, especially since not the
   least

   intimation or warning against that damnable heresy is to be found in
   the act itself,

   nor was made to that Assembly, in passing of it.

   To the query, we answer, that we cordially and sincerely own a holy
   life, or good

   works, necessary, as an acknowledgment of God's sovereignty, and in
   obedience

   to his command: for this is the will of God, even our sanctification;
   and, by a

   special ordination, he has appointed believers to walk in them:
   necessary, for

   glorifying God before the world, and showing the virtues of him who
   hath called

   us out of darkness into his marvellous light: necessary, as being the
   end of our

   election, our redemption, effectual calling, and regeneration; for "the
   Father chose

   us in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that we should be
   holy; the Son

   gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and
   purify to

   himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works"; and by the Holy
   Spirit are we

   created in Christ Jesus unto them: necessary, as expressions of our
   gratitude to

   our great Benefactor; for being bought with a price, we are no more our
   own, but

   henceforth, in a most peculiar manner bound, in our bodies and in our
   spirits,

   which are his, to glorify, and by all possible ways, to testify our
   thanksgiving to

   our Lord Redeemer and Ransomer; to him "who spared not his own Son, but

   gave him up to the death for us all"; to him "who humbled himself, and
   became

   obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, for us": necessary,
   as being the

   design, not only of the world, but of all ordinances and providences;
   even that as

   he who has called us is holy, so we should be holy in all manner of
   conversation:

   necessary, again, for evidencing and confirming our faith, good works
   being the

   breath, the native offspring and issue of it: necessary, for making our
   calling and

   election sure; for they are, though no plea, yet a good evidence for
   heaven, or an

   argument confirming our assurance and hope of salvation: necessary, to
   the

   maintaining of inward peace and comfort, though not as the ground and

   foundation, yet as effects, fruits, and concomitants of faith:
   necessary, in order to

   our entertaining communion with God even in this life; for, "if we say
   we have

   fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the
   truth":

   necessary, to the escaping of judgments, and to the enjoyment of many
   promised

   blessings; particularly there is a necessity of order and method, that
   one be holy

   before he can be admitted to see and enjoy God in heaven; that being a
   disposing

   mean, preparing for the salvation of it, and the king's highway chalked
   out for the

   redeemed to walk into the city: necessary, to adorn the gospel and
   grace our holy

   calling and profession: necessary, further, for the edification, good,
   and comfort,

   of fellow-believers: necessary, to prevent offence, and to stop the
   mouths of the

   wicked; to win likewise the unbelieving, and to commend Christ and his
   ways to

   the consciences: necessary, finally, for the establishment, security,
   and glory of

   churches and nations. Though we firmly believe holiness necessary upon
   all these

   and more accounts, and that the Christian ought to live in the
   continued exercise

   of gospel repentance, which is one main constituent of gospel holiness,
   yet we

   dare not say a holy life is necessary in order to the obtaining of
   eternal happiness;

   for, to say nothing of the more gross sense of these words, [manifestly
   injurious

   to the free grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, by faith in whose
   righteousness alone

   we are appointed to obtain salvation, from first to last,] which yet is
   obvious

   enough, though we are far from imputing it to the Assembly; we cannot,
   however

   they may be explained into an orthodox meaning, look upon them as
   wholesome

   words, since they have at least an appearance of evil, being such a way
   of

   expression as Protestant churches and divines, knowing the strong
   natural bias in

   all men towards seeking salvation, not by faith in our Lord Jesus
   Christ, but by

   works of righteousness done by themselves, and the danger of
   symbolizing with

   Papists and other enemies of the grace of the gospel, have
   industriously shunned

   to use on that head; they choosing rather to call holiness and good
   works

   necessary duties of the persons justified and saved, than conditions of
   salvation;

   consequents and effects of salvation already obtained, or antecedents,
   disposing

   and preparing the subject for the salvation to be obtained, than any
   sort of causes,

   or proper means of obtaining the possession of salvation; which last
   honour, the

   Scripture, for the high praise and glory of sovereign grace, seems to
   have reserved

   peculiarly unto faith; and rather to say, that holiness is necessary in
   them that

   shall be saved, than necessary to salvation; that we are saved, not by
   good works,

   but rather to them, as fruits and effects of saving grace; or that
   holiness is

   necessary unto salvation, not so much as a mean to the end, as a part
   of the end

   itself; which part of our salvation is necessary, to make us meet for
   the other that

   is yet behind.

   Wherefore, since this way of speaking of holiness with respect to
   salvation, is, we

   conceive, without warrant in the holy Scripture, dissonant from the
   doctrinal

   standards of our own and other reformed churches, as well as from the
   chosen

   and deliberate speech of reformed divines treating on these heads; and
   since it

   being at best but proposition male sonans, may easily be mistaken, and

   afterwards improved, as a shade or vehicle, for conveying corrupt
   sentiments,

   anent the influence of works upon salvation; we cannot but reckon
   preaching the

   necessity of holiness in such terms to be of some dangerous consequence
   to the

   doctrine of free grace. In which apprehension we are the more
   confirmed, that at

   this day the doctrine of Christ, and his free grace, both as to the
   purity and

   efficacy of the same, seems to be much on the wane, and Popery, with
   other

   dangerous errors and heresies destructive of it, on the waxing; which
   certainly

   calls aloud to the churches of Christ, and to his ministers in
   particular, for the

   more zeal, watchfulness, and caution, with reference to the interests
   of truth; and

   that especially at such a time, cum hereticis nec nomina habeamus
   communia, ne

   eorum errori favere videamur.

   If in any case, certainly in framing acts and standards of doctrine,
   there is great

   need of delicacy in the choice of words; for the words of the Holy
   Ghost in

   Scripture, under which we include such as in meaning and import are
   equivalent

   to them, being an ordinance of divine institution, for preserving the
   truth of the

   gospel, if these be once altered or varied, all the wisdom and
   vigilance of men will

   be ineffectual to that end. And it is well known, by costly experience
   to the

   churches of Christ, that their falling in with the language or phrase
   of corrupt

   teachers, instead of serving the interest of truth, which never looks
   so well as in

   its own native simplicity, does but grieve the stable and judicious,
   stagger the

   weak, betray the ignorant, and, instead of gaining, harden and open the
   mouths of

   adversaries. And that it is said in a text, "They do it to obtain a
   corruptible crown,

   but we an incorruptible," will not warrant the manner of speech in the
   query; for

   the word, in the original, signifies only to receive or apprehend,
   being accordingly

   rendered in all Latin versions we have seen, and in our own translation
   in the

   verse immediately preceding, viz: "One receiveth the prize"; and though
   the word

   did signify to obtain, in the most strict and proper sense it could not
   make for the

   purpose, unless it were meant of the believer's obtaining the
   incorruptible crown,

   not by faith, but by works. And that an ill chosen word in a standard
   may prove

   more dangerous to the truth, than one not so justly rendered in a
   translation, with

   several other things on this head, might be made very evident, were it
   not that we

   have been, we fear, tedious on it already.

   QUERY VIII.--Is knowledge, belief, and persuasion, that Christ died for
   me,

   and that he is mine, and that whatever he did and suffered, he did and
   suffered

   for me, the direct act of faith, whereby a sinner is united to Christ,
   interested in

   him, instated in God's covenant of grace? Or, is that knowledge a
   persuasion

   included in the very essence of that justifying act of faith?

   Ans. The query, it is evident, exceedingly narrows the import and
   design of the

   Representation in the place referred to; for there we assert nothing
   positively

   concerning the passages relating to faith, but remonstrate against
   condemning

   them, as what to us seemed to hurt the appropriating act of faith, and
   to fix a blot

   upon the Reformation, reformed churches, and divines, who had generally
   taught

   concerning faith, as in the condemned passages; all which we might say,
   without

   determining whether the persuasion spoke of in the query was the very
   direct and

   formal act of justifying faith, yea or no. But now, since the query is
   put so close,

   and since the matter in question is no other than the old Protestant
   doctrine on

   that head, as we shall endeavour to make appear, the Reverend
   Commission, we

   humbly conceive, cannot take it amiss, if we, in the first place,
   inquire into the

   true sense and meaning of this way of speaking of faith, that we are
   now

   questioned about.

   The main of the condemned passages the query refers to, runs not in the
   order

   therein set down, but as follows: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ,
   and thou shalt

   be saved"; that is, "Be verily persuaded in your heart that Christ
   Jesus is yours,

   and that you shall have life and salvation by him; that whatever Christ
   did for the

   redemption of mankind, he did it for you": being in matter the same
   with what has

   been commonly taught in the Protestant churches, and, in words of the
   renowned

   Mr. John Rogers, of Dodham, [a man so noted for orthodoxy, holiness,
   and the

   Lord's countenancing of his ministry, that no sound Protestants in
   Britain or

   Ireland, of what denomination soever, would, in the age wherein he
   lived, have

   taken upon them to condemn as erroneous] his definition of faith, which
   we have

   as follows: "A particular persuasion of my heart that Christ Jesus is
   mine, and that

   I shall have life and salvation by his means; that whatsoever Christ
   did for the

   redemption of mankind, he did it for me." Where one may see, though the

   difference in words be almost none at all, yet it runs rather stronger
   with him than

   in the Marrow.

   In which account of saving faith, we have, first, the general nature of
   it; viz: a real

   persuasion, agreeing to all sorts of faith whatsoever; for it is
   certain, whatever one

   believes, he is verily persuaded of. More particularly, it is a
   persuasion in the

   heart, whereby it is distinguished from a general, dead, and naked
   assent in the

   head, which one gives to things that no way affect him, because he
   reckons they

   do not concern him. But with the heart man believes here; "If thou
   believest with

   all thine heart," says the Scripture. For as a man's believing in his
   heart the

   dreadful tidings of the law, or its curse, imports not only an assent
   to them as

   true, but a horror of them as evil; so here, the being persuaded in
   one's heart of

   the glad tidings of the gospel, bears not only an assent unto them as
   true, but a

   relish of them as good.

   Then we have the most special nature of it, viz: an appropriating
   persuasion, or a

   persuasion, with application to a person's self, that Christ is his,
   &c. The

   particulars whereof are, first, that Christ is yours; the ground of
   which persuasion

   is the offer and grant of Christ as a Saviour in the word, to be
   believed in for

   salvation, by all to whom the gospel is made known. By which offer and
   setting

   forth of Christ as a Saviour, though before we believe, we wanting
   union with

   him, have no actual or saving interest in him, yet he is in some sense
   ours,

   namely, so as it is lawful and warrantable for us, not for fallen
   angels, to take

   possession of him and his salvation by faith; without which, our common
   interest

   in him as a Saviour, by virtue of the offer and grant in the word, will
   avail us

   nothing. But though the call and offer of the gospel, being really
   particular, every

   one, both in point of duty and in point of interest, ought to
   appropriate, apply, or

   make his own the thing offered, by believing, they having good and
   sufficient

   ground and warrant in the word so to do; yet is it either neglected and
   despised,

   or the truth and sincerity of it suspected and called in question,
   until the Holy

   Spirit, by setting home the word of the gospel, with such a measure of
   evidence

   and power as is effectual, satisfies the convinced sinner, that, with
   application to

   himself in particular, "it is a faithful saying, worthy of all
   acceptation, that Jesus

   Christ came to save sinners," and enables him to believe it. Thus the
   persuasion

   of faith is begotten, which is always proportioned to the measure of
   evidence and

   power from above that sovereign grace is pleased to put forth for
   working of it.

   The next branch of the persuasion is, "that you shall have life and
   salvation by

   him," namely, the life of holiness as well as of happiness; salvation
   from sin as

   well as from wrath, not in heaven only, but begun, carried on here, and

   completed hereafter;--the true notion of life and salvation, according
   to the

   Scriptures, and as Protestant divines are wont to explain it. Wherefore
   this

   persuasion of faith is inconsistent with an unwillingness to part with
   sin, a bent or

   purpose of heart to continue in it. There can be little question, we
   apprehend,

   whether this branch of the persuasion belongs to the nature of
   justifying faith; for

   salvation being above all things in a sensible sinner's eye, he can
   never believe any

   thing to his satisfaction, unless he sees ground to believe comfortably
   concerning

   it. Few therefore will, we conceive, differ from Dr. Collins, laying it
   down as a

   conclusion on this very head, namely, that "a Christian cannot have
   true, saving,

   justifying faith, unless he doth [I do not say, unless he think he
   doth, or unless he

   saith he doth, but, unless, he doth] believe, and is persuaded that God
   will pardon

   his sins." Further this being a believing on the Son for life and
   salvation, is the

   same with receiving of him, [as this last is explained by the Holy
   Spirit himself,

   (John 1:12),] and likewise evidently bears the soul's resting on Christ
   for

   salvation; for it is not possible to conceive a soul resting on Christ
   for salvation,

   without a persuasion that it shall have life and salvation by him,
   namely, a

   persuasion of the same measure and degree as resting is.

   The third branch of the persuasion, "that whatsoever Christ did for the

   redemption of mankind, he did it for you,"--being much the same, in
   other

   words, with these of the apostle--"Who loved me, and gave himself for
   me"; and

   coming in the last place, we think none will question but whosoever
   believes, in

   the manner before explained, may and ought to believe this in the like
   measure

   and in the same order. And it is certain, all who receive and rest on
   Christ for

   salvation, believe it, if not explicitly, yet virtually and really.

   Now, as this account of justifying faith runs in terms much less strong
   than those

   of many eminent divines, who used to define it by a persuasion of God's
   love, of

   his special mercy to one's self, of the remission of his sins, &c.; so
   it is the same

   for substance and matter, though the words be not the same with that of
   our

   Shorter Catechism, viz: "A receiving and resting upon Christ alone for
   salvation,

   as he is offered to us in the gospel": where it is evident the offer of
   Christ to us,

   though mentioned in the last place, is to be believed first; for till
   the soul be

   persuaded that Christ crucified is in the gospel set forth, offered,
   and exhibited to

   it as if expressed by name, there can be no believing on him. And when
   the offer

   is brought home to a person by the Holy Ghost, there will be a measure
   of

   persuasion that Christ is his, as above explained. And that receiving,
   or believing

   in, and resting on him for salvation, cannot be without some measure of

   persuasion that one shall have life and salvation by him, was said
   already. But

   more directly to the query.

   We answer, 1st, Since our reformers and their successors, such as
   Luther, Calvin,

   Melancthon, Beza, Bullinger, Bucer, Knox, Craig, Melvil, Bruce,
   Davidson,

   Forbes, &c.,--men eminently endowed with the spirit of truth and who
   fetch

   their notions of it immediately from the fountain of the holy
   Scripture; the most

   eminent doctors and professors of theology that have been in the
   Protestant

   churches, such as Ursinus, Zanchius, Junius, Piscator, Rollock, Daneus,

   Wendelinus, Chamierus, Sharpius, Bodius, Pareus, Altingius, Triglandii,

   [Gisbertus and Jacobus] Arnoldus, Maresius; the four professors of
   Leyden, viz:

   Walleus, Rivetus, Polyander, Thysius; Wollebius, Heideggerus, Essenius,

   Turretinus, &c.; with many eminent British divines, such as Perkins,
   Pemble,

   Willet, Gouge, Roberts, Burgess, Owen, &c.; the churches themselves of

   Helvetia, the Palatinate, France, Holland, England, Ireland, Scotland,
   in their

   standards of doctrine; all the Lutheran churches, who, in point of
   orthodoxy on

   the head of justification and faith, are second to none; the renowned
   synod of

   Dort, made up of eminent divines, called and commissionate from seven

   reformed states and kingdoms, besides those of the several provinces of
   the

   Netherlands; since these, we say, all of them stand for that special,
   fiducia,

   confidence, or appropriating persuasion of faith spoken of in the
   condemned

   passages of the Marrow, upon which this query is raised; the synod of
   Dort,

   besides the minds of the several delegates on this head, in their
   several suffrages

   anent the Five Articles, declaring themselves plainly both in their
   final decisions

   concerning the said articles, and in their solemn and ample approbation
   of the

   Palatine Catechism, as agreeable to the word of God in all things, and
   as

   containing nothing that ought either to be altered or amended; which
   Catechism

   being full and plain as to this persuasion of faith, has been commented
   upon by

   many great divines, received by most of all the reformed churches, as a
   most

   excellent commend of the orthodox Christian doctrine, and particularly
   by the

   Church of Scotland, as the Rev. Mr. Robert Wodrow lately told his
   Majesty King

   George, in the dedication of his history; and since we, with this whole
   church and

   nation are, by virtue of the awful tie of the oath of God in our
   national covenant,

   bound ever to abhor and detest the Popish general and doubtsome faith,
   with all

   the erroneous decrees of Trent; among which, in opposition to the
   special fiducia

   of faith therein condemned this is established; being by Protestants,
   so called,

   mainly for their denying and opposing the confidence and persuasion of
   faith,

   with application to one's self, now in question; by which renunciation
   our

   forefathers, no doubt, pointed at, and asserted to be held and
   professed as God's

   undoubted truth and verity, that particular and confident, or assured
   faith, then

   commonly known and maintained in this church, as standing plain and
   express in

   her standards, to the profession and defence of which they in the same
   covenant

   promising and swearing by the great name of the Lord our God, bound

   themselves and us: and since the same persuasion of faith, however the
   way of

   speaking on that head is come to be somewhat altered, was never by any

   judicatory of a reformed Church, until now, denied or condemned:
   considering all

   these things, we say, and of what dangerous consequence such a judicial

   alteration may be, we cannot, we dare not consent unto the condemnation
   of that

   point of doctrine; for we cannot think of charging error and delusion
   in a matter

   of such importance upon so many Protestant divines, eminent for
   holiness and

   learning; upon the Protestant churches; and upon our own forefathers,
   so signally

   owned of the Lord; and also on the standards of Protestant doctrine, in
   this

   Church, for nigh an hundred years after her reformation: else, if we
   should thus

   speak, we are persuaded we would offend against the generation of his
   children.

   Nor can it ever enter into our minds, that the famous Assembly of
   Westminster

   had it so much as once in their thought, to depart in this point from
   the doctrine

   of their own, and of this church, which they were all of them by the
   strongest ties

   bound to maintain; or to go off from the synod of Dort, which had but
   so lately

   before them settled the Protestant principles as to doctrine; and by so
   doing yield

   up to Socinians, Arminians, and Papists, what all of them have a mortal
   aversion

   to, namely, the special fiducia or appropriating persuasion of faith,
   which

   Protestant divines before and since that time contended for to their
   utmost, as

   being not only a precious truth, but a point of vast consequence to
   religion. And

   we are sure the Assemblies of this Church understood, and received
   their

   confessions and catechisms larger and shorter, as entirely consistent
   with our

   confessions and catechisms before that time, as we have already made
   evident in

   our representation, from the acts of Assembly receiving and approving
   the

   Westminster Confession and Catechisms.

   Answer 2d, It is to be considered, that most of the words of the Holy
   Ghost,

   made use of in the Old and New Testament, for expressing the nature of
   faith and

   believing, do import the confidence or persuasion in question; and that
   confidence

   and trust in the Old Testament are expounded by faith and believing in
   the New;

   and the same things attributed to the latter, as were wont to be
   attributed to the

   former; that diffidence and doubting are in their nature acts and
   effects contrary

   to faith; that peace and joy are the native effects of believing; that
   the promises of

   the gospel, and Christ in his priestly office therein held forth, are
   the proper

   objects of justifying faith; that, faithfulness in God, and faith in
   the believer, being

   relatives, and the former the ground of the latter, our faith should
   answer to his

   faithfulness, by trusting his good word of promise for the sake of it;
   that it is

   certain a believer in the exercise of justifying faith does believe
   something with

   reference to his own salvation upon the ground of God's faithfulness in
   the

   promise; that no other person whatsoever does or can believe; which if
   it be not

   to this purpose, that now Christ is and will be a Saviour to him, that
   he shall have

   life and salvation by him, we are utterly at a loss to conceive what it
   can be; that

   persuasion, confidence, and assuredness, are so much attributed to
   faith in the

   Scripture, and the saints in Scripture ordinarily express themselves in
   their

   addresses to God in words of appropriation; and finally, that according
   to our

   Larger Catechism, faith justifies a sinner in the sight of God, as an
   instrument,

   receiving and applying Christ, and his righteousness held forth in the
   promise of

   the gospel, and resteth thereupon for pardon of sin, and for the
   accepting and

   accounting one's person righteous before God for salvation; the which,
   how faith

   can do without some measure of the confidence, or appropriating
   persuasion we

   are now upon, seems extremely hard to conceive. Upon these
   considerations, and

   others too long to be here inserted, we cannot but think, that
   confidence, or trust

   in Jesus Christ, as our Saviour, and the free grace and mercy of God in
   him as

   crucified, offered to us in the gospel for salvation, [including
   justification,

   sanctification, and future glory,] upon the ground and security of the
   divine

   faithfulness plighted in the gospel promise; and upon the warrant of
   the divine call

   and command to believe in the name of the Son of God; or, which is the
   same, in

   other words, a persuasion of life and salvation, from the free love and
   mercy of

   God, in and through Jesus Christ, a crucified Saviour offered to us,
   upon the

   security and warrant aforesaid, is the very direct, uniting,
   justifying, and

   appropriating act of faith, whereby the convinced sinner becomes
   possessed of

   Christ and his saving benefits, instated in God's covenant and family;
   taking this

   always along, as supposed, that all is set home and wrought by the Holy
   Spirit,

   who brings Christ, his righteousness, salvation, and whole fullness,
   nigh to us in

   the promise and offer of the gospel; clearing at the same time our
   right and

   warrant to intermeddle with all, without fear of vicious intromission,
   encouraging

   and enabling to a measure of confident application, and taking home of
   all to

   ourselves freely, without money and without price.

   This confidence, persuasion, or whatever other name it may be called
   by, we take

   to be the very same with what our Confession and Catechisms call
   accepting,

   receiving, and resting on Christ offered in the gospel for salvation;
   and with what

   polemic and practical divines call "Fiducia specialis misericordia,"
   Fiducial

   application," "fiducial apprehension," "fiducial adherence,"
   "recumbence,"

   "affiance," "fiducial acquiescence," "appropriating persuasion," &c.
   All which, if

   duly explained, would issue in a measure of this confidence or
   persuasion we

   have been speaking of. However, we are fully satisfied this is what our
   fathers

   and the body of Protestant divines, speaking with the Scriptures called
   "the

   assurance of faith." That once burning and shining light of this
   church, Mr. John

   Davidson, though in his Catechism he defines faith by a "hearty
   assurance" that

   our sins are freely forgiven us in Christ; or, a sure persuasion of the
   heart that

   Christ by his death and resurrection has taken away our sins, and
   clothing us with

   his own perfect righteousness, has thoroughly restored us to the favour
   of God;

   which he reckoned all one with a "Hearty receiving of Christ offered in
   the gospel

   for the remission of sins"; yet in a former part of the same Catechism
   he gives us

   to understand what sort of assurance and persuasion it was he meant, as
   follows:

   "And certain it is," he says, "that both the enlightening of the mind
   to

   acknowledge the truth of the promise of salvation to us in Christ, and
   the sealing

   up of the certainty thereof in our hearts and minds, [of the which two
   parts, as it

   were, faith consists,] are the works and effects of the Spirit of God."
   In like

   manner, in our first Confession of Faith, Art. 3, 12, it is called, "An
   assured faith

   in the promise of God revealed to us in his word; by which faith we
   apprehend

   Christ Jesus, with the graces and benefits promised in him."--"This
   faith, and the

   assurance of the same, proceeds not from flesh and blood." And in our
   first

   Catechism, commonly called Calvin's Catechism, faith is defined by a
   "sure

   persuasion" and "steadfast knowledge" of God's tender love towards us,

   according as he has plainly uttered in his gospel, that he will be a
   Father and

   Saviour to us, through the means of Jesus Christ; and again, "faith
   which God's

   Spirit worketh in our hearts, assuring of God's promises made to us in
   his holy

   Gospel." In the Summula Catechismi, or Rudimenta Pietatis, to the
   question,

   "Quid est fides?" the answer is, "Cum mihi persuadeo Deum me omnesque

   sanctos amare, nobisque Christum cum omnibus suis bonis gratis donare";
   and in

   the margin, "Nam in fide duplex persuasio, 1. De amore Dei erga nos; 2.
   De Dei

   beneficiis que ex amore fluunt, Christo nimirum, cum omnibus suis
   bonis," &c.

   And to that question, "Quomodo fide percipimus, et nobis applicamus
   corpus

   Christi crucifixi?" the answer is, "Dum nobis persuademus Christi
   mortem et

   crucifixionem non minus ad nos pertinere quam si ipsi nos pro peccatis
   nostris

   crucifixi essemus. Persuasiio autem hec est vere fidei." From all which
   it is

   evident, they held, that a belief of the promises of the gospel, with
   application to

   oneself, or a confidence in a crucified Saviour, for a man's own
   salvation, is the

   very essence of justifying faith; or, that we become actually possessed
   of Christ,

   remission of sins, &c., in and by the act of believing, or confidence
   in him, as

   above explained. And this with them was the assurance of faith, which
   widely

   differs from the Antinomian sense of the assurance or persuasion of
   faith which

   is, that Christ, and pardon of sin, are ours, no less before believing
   than after; a

   sense which we heartily disclaim.

   Whether these words in the query, viz: "Or, is that knowledge a
   persuasion

   included in the very essence of that justifying act of faith"; be
   exegetic of the

   former part of it, or a new branch of the query; we answer, that we
   have already

   explained the persuasion of faith by us held, and do think, that in the
   language of

   faith, though not in the language of philosophy, knowledge, and
   persuasion,

   relating to the same object, go hand in hand in the same measure and
   degree.

   It is evident that the confidence or persuasion of faith for which we
   plead,

   includes, or necessarily and infallibly infers consent and resting,
   together with all

   the blessed fruits and effects of faith, in proportion to the measure
   of it. And that

   we have mentioned consent, we cannot but be the more confirmed in this
   matter,

   when we consider, that such a noted person as Mr. Baxter, though he had
   made

   the marriage consent to Christ, as King and Lord, the formal act of
   justifying

   faith, as being an epitome of all gospel obedience, including and
   binding to all the

   duties of the married state, and so giving right to all the privileges:
   and had

   thereby, as well as by his other dangerous notions about justification,
   and other

   points connected therewith, scattered through his works, corrupted the
   fountain,

   and endangered the faith of many; yet after all, came to be of another
   mind, and

   had the humility to tell the world so much; for Mr. Cross informs us
   [Serm. on

   Romans 4:2, p. 148,] that Mr. Baxter, in his little book against Dr.
   Crisp's errors,

   says, "I formerly believed the formal nature of faith to lie in
   consent; but now I

   recant it. I believe," says he, "it lies in trust: this makes the right
   to lie in the

   object; for it is, I depend on Christ as the matter or merit of my
   pardon, my life,

   my crown, my glory."

   There are two things further, concerning this persuasion of faith, that
   would be

   adverted to: one is, that it is not axiomatical, but real; that is, the
   sinner has not

   always, at his first closing with Christ, nor afterwards, such a clear,
   steady, and

   full persuasion that Christ is his, that his sins are forgiven, and
   that he eventually

   shall be saved, as that he dare profess the same to others, or even
   positively

   assert it within himself; yet, upon the first saving manifestation of
   Christ to him,

   such a persuasion and humble confidence is begotten, as is real and
   relieving, and

   particular as to himself and his own salvation, and which works a
   proportionable

   hope as to the issue; though, through the humbling impressions he has
   of himself

   and his own guilt at the time, the awe of God's majesty, justice, and
   holiness on

   his spirit, and his indistinct knowledge of the doctrine of the gospel,
   with the

   grounds and warrants of believing therein contained, he fears to
   express it directly

   and particularly of himself. The other is, that whatever is said of the
   habit,

   actings, strength, weakness, and intermittings of the exercise of
   saving faith, the

   same is to be said of this persuasion in all points. From all which it
   is evident, the

   doubts, fears, and darkness, so frequently to be found in true
   believers, can very

   well consist with this persuasion in the same subject; for though these
   may be,

   and often are in the believer, yet they are not of his faith, which in
   its nature and

   exercise is as opposite to them as light is to darkness, the flesh to
   the Spirit; which

   though they be in the same subject, yet are contrary the one to the
   other, (Gal

   5:17). And, therefore, faith wrestles against them, though with various
   success, it

   being sometimes so far overcome and brought under by the main force and
   much

   superior strength of prevailing unbelief, that it cannot be discerned
   more than the

   fire is when covered with ashes, or the sun when wrapt up in thick
   clouds. The

   confidence and persuasion of faith being in many, at first especially,
   but as the

   grain of mustard-seed cast into the ground, or like a spark amidst the
   troubled sea

   of all manner of corruption and lust, where the rolling waves of
   unbelieving

   doubts and fears, hellish temptations and suggestions, and the like,
   moving on the

   face of that depth, are every now and then going over it; and, were
   there not a

   divine hand and care engaged for its preservation, would effectually
   extinguish

   and bury it. What wonder that in such a case it many times cannot be
   discerned?

   yet will it still hold so much of the exercise of justifying faith, so
   much persuasion.

   Yea, not only may a believer have this persuasion and not know it for
   the time,

   [as says Collins, Roberts, Amesius, and others, who distinguish the
   persuasion

   from the sense of it,] but he, being under the power of temptation and
   confusion

   of mind, may resolutely deny he has any such persuasion or conscience;
   while it

   is evident to others at the same time, by its effects, that he really
   has it: for which,

   one may, among others, see the holy and learned Haliburton, in his
   "Inquiry into

   the Nature of God's Act of Justification," p. 27. And if one would see
   the

   consistence of faith's persuasion with doubting, well discoursed and
   illustrated, he

   may consult Downham's "Christian Warfare." But we--

   Answer 3dly, There is a full persuasion and assurance, by reflection,
   spiritual

   argumentation, or inward sensation, which we are far from holding to be
   of the

   essence of faith; but this last, being mediate, and collected by
   inference, as we

   gather the cause from such signs and effects as give evidence of it, is
   very

   different from that confidence or persuasion, by divines called the
   assurance of

   faith. "Sanctification," says Rutherford, "does not evidence
   justification, as faith

   doth evidence it, with such a sort of clearness, as light evidenceth
   colours, though

   it be no sign or evident mark of them; but as smoke evinces fire, and
   as the

   morning star in the east evinces the sun will early rise, or as the
   streams prove

   there is a head-spring whence they issue, though none of these make
   what they

   evidence visible to the eye; so doth sanctification give evidence of
   justification,

   only as marks, signs, effects, give evidence to the cause." He calls it
   a light of

   arguing and of heavenly logic, by which we know that we know God, by
   the light

   of faith, because we keep his commandments. "In effect," says he, "we
   know

   rather the person must be justified, in whom these gracious evidences
   are, by

   hearsay report or consequence, than that we know or see justification,
   or faith

   itself, in abstracto; but the light of faith, the testimony of the
   Spirit by the

   operation of free grace, will cause us, as it were, with our eyes, to
   see justification

   and faith, not by report, but as we see the sun-light." Again he says,
   "We never

   had a question with Antinomians touching the first assurance of
   justification, such

   as is proper to the light of faith. He [Cornwall] might have spared all
   his

   arguments to prove that we are first assured of our justification by
   faith, not by

   good works, for we grant the arguments of one sort of assurance, which
   is proper

   to faith, and they prove nothing against another sort of assurance, by
   signs and

   effects, which is also divine." Further, as to the difference between
   these two

   kinds of assurance: the assurance of faith has its object and
   foundation without

   the man, but that of sense has them within him. The assurance of faith
   looks to

   Christ, the promise and covenant of God, and says, "This is all my
   salvation; God

   has spoken in his holiness, I will rejoice"; but the assurance of sense
   looks inward

   at the works of God, such as the person's own graces, attainments,
   experiences,

   and the like. The assurance of faith giving an evidence to things not
   seen, can

   claim an interest in, and plead a saving relation to a hiding,
   withdrawing God.

   Zion said, "My Lord hath forgotten me"; and the spouse, "I opened to my

   beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone." So he may
   be a

   forgetting and withdrawing God to my feeling, "and yet to my faith, my
   God and

   my Lord still," says holy Rutherford; "even as the wife may believe the
   angry and

   forsaking husband is still her husband." But on the other hand, the
   assurance of

   sense is the evidence of things seen and felt. The one says, "I take
   him for mine";

   the other says, "I feel he is mine." The one says with the church, "My
   God,

   though he cover himself with a cloud, that my prayer cannot pass
   through, yet

   will hear me"; the other, "My God has heard me." The one says, "He will
   bring

   me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness"; the
   other, "He has

   brought me forth to the light, and I do behold his righteousness." The
   one says,

   "Though he should kill me, yet will I trust in him"; the other, "He
   smiles and

   shines on me, therefore, will I love him and trust in him."

   Upon the whole, we humbly conceive, were the nature and grounds of
   faith's

   persuasion more narrowly and impartially under the guidance of the
   Spirit of

   truth, searched into and laid open, it would, instead of discouraging
   weak

   Christians, exceedingly tend to the strengthening and increase of
   faith, and

   consequently have a mighty influence on spiritual comfort, and true
   gospel

   holiness, which will always be found to bear proportion to faith, as
   effects do to

   the efficacy and influence of their causes.

   QUERY IX.--What is that act of faith, by which a sinner appropriates
   Christ

   and his saving benefits to himself?

   Ans.--This question being plainly and fully answered in what is said on
   the

   immediately foregoing, we refer thereto, and proceed to the tenth.

   QUERY X.--Whether the revelation of the divine will in the word,
   affording a

   warrant to offer Christ unto all, and a warrant to all to receive him,
   can be said

   to be the Father's making a deed of gift and grant of Christ unto all
   mankind? Is

   this grant to all mankind by sovereign grace? And whether is it
   absolute or

   conditional!

   Ans.--Here we are directed to that part of our representation where we
   complain

   that the following passage is condemned, viz: "The Father hath made a
   deed of

   gift or grant unto all mankind, that whosoever of them shall believe in
   his Son,

   shall not perish"; and where we say, "That this treatment of the said
   passage

   seems to encroach on the warrants aforesaid, and also upon sovereign
   grace,

   which hath made this grant, not to devils, but to men, in terms than
   which none

   can be imagined more extensive"; agreeable to what we have already said
   in our

   representation. We answer to the first part of the question, that by
   the "deed of

   gift or grant unto all mankind," we understand no more than the
   revelation of the

   divine will in the word, affording warrant to offer Christ to all, and
   a warrant to all

   to receive him; for although we believe the purchase and application of

   redemption to be peculiar to the elect, who were given by the Father to
   Christ in

   the counsel of peace, yet the warrant to receive him is common to all.
   Ministers,

   by virtues of the commission they have received from their great Lord
   and

   Master, are authorized and instructed to go preach the gospel to every
   creature,

   i.e., to make a full, free, and unhampered offer of him, his grace,
   righteousness,

   and salvation, to every rational soul to whom they may in providence
   have access

   to speak. And though we had a voice like a trumpet, that could reach
   all the

   corners of the earth, we think we would be bound, by virtue of our
   commission,

   to lift it up, and say, "To you, O men, do we call, and our voice is to
   the sons of

   men. God hath so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
   that

   whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life." And

   though this "deed of gift and grant, that whosoever believeth in Christ
   shall not

   perish," &c. is, neither in our representation, nor in the passages of
   the book

   condemned on that head, called a "deed of gift, and grant of Christ,"
   yet, being

   required to give our judgment in this point, we think, that agreeable
   to the Holy

   Scripture, it may be so called, as particularly appears from the text
   last cited,

   (John 3:16), where by the giving of Christ, we understand not only his
   eternal

   destination by the Father to be the Redeemer of an elect world, and his
   giving him

   unto the death for them, in the fullness of time, but more especially a
   giving of

   him in the word unto all, to be received and believed in. The giving
   here cannot

   be a giving in possession, which is peculiar only unto them who
   actually believe,

   but it must be such a giving, granting, or offering, as warrants a man
   to believe or

   receive the gift, and must therefore be anterior to actual believing.
   This is evident

   enough from the text itself: he gave him, "that whosoever believeth in
   him should

   not perish," &c. The context also, to us, puts it beyond controversy:
   the brazen

   serpent was given, and lifted up as a common good to the whole camp of
   Israel,

   that whosoever in all the camp, being stung by the fiery serpents,
   looked

   thereunto, might not die, but live. So here Christ is given to a lost
   world, in the

   word, "that whosoever believes in him should not perish," &c. And in
   this

   respect, we think, Christ is a common Saviour, and his salvation is a
   common

   salvation; and it is "glad tidings of great joy unto all people," that
   unto us [not to

   angels that fell] this Son is given, and this Child is born, whose name
   is called

   Wonderful, &c. (Isa 9:6).

   We have a Scripture also to this purpose, (John 6:32), where Christ,
   speaking to a

   promiscuous multitude, makes a comparison between himself and the manna
   that

   fell about the tents of Israel in the wilderness, and says, "My Father
   giveth you

   the true bread from heaven." As the simple raining of the manna about
   their camp

   is called a giving of it, (verse 21), before it was tasted, or fed
   upon; so the very

   revelation and offer of Christ is called [according to the judicious
   Calvin on the

   place] a giving of him, ere he be received and believed on.

   Of this giving of Christ to mankind lost, we read also, (1 John 5:11),
   "And this is

   the record, that God hath given unto us eternal life, and this life is
   in his Son."

   This giving in the text is not, we conceive, a giving in possession, in
   greater or

   lesser measure, but a giving by way of grant and offer, whereupon one
   may

   warrantably take possession, and the party to whom is not the election
   only, but

   lost mankind; for the record of God here must be such a thing as
   warrants all to

   believe on the Son of God. But it can be no such warrant to tell, "that
   God hath

   given eternal life to the elect"; for the making of a gift to a certain
   select company

   of persons, can never be a warrant for all men to receive or take
   possession of it.

   This will be further evident, if we consider that the great sin of
   unbelief lies in not

   believing this record of God,--"He that believes not hath made God a
   liar," says

   the apostle, (verse 10), "because he believes not the record that God
   gave so his

   Son"; and then it followeth, (verse 11), "And this is the record, that
   God hath

   given to us eternal life," &c. Now, are we to think that the rejecting
   of the record

   of God is a bare disbelieving of this proposition, "That God hath given
   eternal life

   unto the elect?" No, surely; for the most desperate unbelievers, such
   as Judas and

   others, believe this; and their belief of it adds to their anguish and
   torment. Or do

   they, by believing this, set to their seal that God is true? No; they
   still continue,

   notwithstanding of all this, to make him a liar, in "not believing this
   record of

   God," that to lost mankind, and to themselves in particular, God hath
   given

   eternal life, by way of grant, so as they, as well as others, are
   warranted and

   welcome, and every one to whom it comes, on their peril, required by
   faith to

   receive or take possession of it. By not receiving this gifted and
   offered remedy,

   with application and appropriation, they fly in the face of God's
   record and

   testimony; and therefore do justly and deservedly perish, seeing the
   righteousness,

   salvation, and kingdom of God, was brought so near to them, in the free
   offer of

   the gospel, and yet they would not take it. The great pinch and strait,
   we think, of

   an awakened conscience, does not lie in believing that God hath given
   eternal life

   to the elect, but in believing or receiving Christ, offered to us in
   the gospel, with

   particular application to the man himself, in Scripture called "an
   eating the flesh,

   and drinking the blood of the Son of man." And yet, till this
   difficulty be

   surmounted, in greater or lesser measure, he can never be said to
   believe in

   Christ, or receive and rest upon him for salvation. The very taking or
   receiving

   must needs presuppose a giving of Christ; and this giving may be, and
   is, for the

   most part, where there is no receiving; but there can be no receiving
   of Christ for

   salvation where there is not revelation of Christ in the word of the
   gospel,

   affording warrant to receive him, and then, by the effectual operation
   of the

   Spirit, persuading and enabling the sinner to embrace him upon this
   warrant and

   offer. "A man," says the Spirit of God, (John 3:27), "can receive
   nothing, except

   it be given him from heaven." Hence Mr. Rutherford, in his "Christ
   Dying and

   Drawing," &c., page 442, says that "reprobates have as fair a warrant
   to believe

   as the elect have."

   As to the second part of this question, i.e., "Is this grant made to
   all mankind by

   sovereign grace? and, Whether is it absolute or conditional" we answer,
   that this

   grant, made in common to lost mankind, is from sovereign grace only;
   and it

   being ministers' warrant to offer Christ unto all, and people's warrant
   to receive

   him, it cannot fail to be absolutely free; yet so as none can be
   possessed of Christ

   and his benefits, till by faith they receive him.

   QUERY XI.--Is the division of the law, as explained and applied in the

   Marrow, to be justified, and which cannot be rejected without burying
   several

   gospel truths?

   Ans.--We humbly judge the tripartite division of the law, if rightly
   understood,

   may be admitted as orthodox; yet, seeing that which we are concerned
   with, as

   contained in our representation, is only the divisions of the law into
   the law of

   works and the law of Christ, we say, that we are still of opinion, that
   this

   distinction of the law is carefully to be maintained; in regard that by
   the law of

   works we, according to the Scripture, understand the covenant of works,
   which

   believers are wholly and altogether delivered from, although they are
   certainly

   under the law of the ten commandments in the hand of a Mediator. And if
   this

   distinction of the law, thus applied, be overthrown, and declared
   groundless,

   several sweet gospel- truths must unavoidably fall in the ruins of it.
   For instance,

   if there be no difference put between the law as a covenant, and the
   law as a rule

   of life to believers, in the hand of Christ, it must needs follow, that
   the law still

   retains its covenant-form with respect to believers, and that they are
   still under the

   law in this formality, contrary to Scripture, (Rom 6:14, 7:1-3), and to
   the

   Confession of Faith, chap. 19, sect. 6. It would also follow, that the
   sins of

   believers are still to be looked upon as breaches of the covenant of
   works, and

   consequently, that their sins not only deserve the wrath and curse of
   God, [which

   is a most certain truth,] but also make them actually liable to the
   wrath of God,

   and the pains of hell for ever, which is true only of them that are in
   a state of

   black nature: Less. Cat. quest. 19, and contrary to Confess. of Faith,
   chap. 19,

   sect. 1. It will likewise follow, that believers are still to eye God
   as a vindictive

   and wrathful Judge, though his justice be fully satisfied in the death
   and blood of

   their blessed Surety, apprehended by faith. These and many other sweet
   gospel

   truths, we think, fall in the ruins of the foresaid distinction
   condemned as

   groundless.

   QUERY. XII.--Is the hope of heaven and fear of hell to be excluded from
   the

   motives of the believer's obedience? And if not, how can the Marrow be

   defended, that expressly excludes them, though it should allow of other
   motives?

   Ans.--Here we are referred to the third particular head, wherein we
   think the

   Marrow injured by the Assembly's act, which for brevity's sake we do
   not

   transcribe: but agreeable both to our representation and the scope of
   the Marrow,

   we answer, That taking heaven for a state of endless felicity in the
   enjoyment of

   God in Christ, we are so far from thinking that this is to be excluded
   from being a

   motive of the believer's obedience, that we think it the chief end of
   man, next to

   the glory of God; (Psa 83:25), "Whom have I in heaven but thee?" &c.
   Heaven,

   instead of being a reward to the believer, would be a desolate
   wilderness to him

   without the enjoyment of a God in Christ. The Lord and the Lamb are the
   light of

   that place. God himself is the portion of his people; he is their
   shield and

   exceeding great reward. The very cope-stone of the happiness of heaven
   lies in

   being "for ever with the Lord, and in beholding of his glory"; and this
   indeed the

   believer is to have in his eye, as the recompense of reward, and a
   noble motive of

   obedience. But to form conceptions of heaven as a place of pleasure and

   happiness, without the former views of it, and to fancy that this
   heaven is to be

   obtained by our own works and doings, is unworthy of a believer, a
   child of God,

   in regard it is slavish, legal, mercenary, and carnal.

   As for the fear of hell being a motive of the believer's obedience, we
   reckon it one

   of the special branches of that glorious liberty wherewith Christ hath
   made his

   people free, that they yield obedience to the Lord, not out of slavish
   fear of hell

   and wrath, but out of a child-like love and willing mind, Confess,
   chap. 20, sect.

   6. "Christ hath delivered us out of the hands of our enemies, that we
   might serve

   him without fear, in holiness and righteousness, all the days of our
   lives," (Luke

   1:74,75). A filial fear of God and of his fatherly displeasure, is
   worthy of the

   believer, being a fruit of faith, and of the spirit of adoption; but a
   slavish fear of

   hell and wrath, from which he is delivered by Christ, is not a fruit of
   faith, but of

   unbelief. And in so far as a believer is not drawn with love, but
   driven on in his

   obedience with a slavish fear of hell, we think him, in so far under a
   spirit of

   bondage. And judging this to be the Marrow's sense of rewards and
   punishments

   with respect to a believer, we think it may and ought to be defended.

   And this doctrine, which we apprehend to be the truth, stands supported
   not only

   by Scripture and our Confession of Faith, but also by the suffrages of
   some of

   our soundest divines; for instance Mr. Rutherford:--"Believers," says
   he, "are to

   be sad for their sins, as offensive to the authority of the Lawgiver
   and the love of

   Christ, though they be not to fear the eternal punishment of them"; for
   sorrow for

   sin, and fear for sin are most different to us. Again, says the same
   author, "Servile

   obedience, under apprehension of legal terror, was never commanded in
   the

   spiritual law of God to the Jews, more than to us." Durham, "The
   believer [says

   he] being freed from the law as a covenant, his life depends not on the
   promise

   annexed to the law, nor is he in danger by the threatenings adjoined to
   it, both

   these to believers being made void through Christ." And to conclude, we
   are

   clearly of Dr. Owen's mind anent the use of threatenings of everlasting
   wrath with

   reference unto believers, who, though he owns them to be declarative of
   God's

   hatred of sin, and his will to punish it, yet in regard the execution
   of them is

   inconsistent with the covenant, and God's faithfulness therein, says,
   "The use of

   them cannot be to beget in believers an anxious, doubting, solicitous
   fear about

   the punishment threatened, grounded on a supposition that the person
   fearing

   shall be overtaken with it, or a perplexing fear of hell-fire; which,
   though it

   ofttimes be a consequence of some of God's dispensations toward us of
   our own

   sins, or the weakness of our faith, is not any where prescribed unto us
   as a duty,

   nor is the ingenerating of it in us the design of any of the
   threatenings of God."

   His reasons, together with the nature of that fear, which the
   threatening of eternal

   wrath ought to beget in believers, may be viewed among the rest of the

   authorities.

   These are some thoughts that have offered to us upon the queries, which
   we lay

   before the Reverend Commission with all becoming deference, humbly
   craving,

   that charity, which thinketh no evil, may procure a favourable
   construing of our

   words, so as no sense may be put upon, nor inference drawn from, them
   which

   we never intended. And in regard the tenor of our doctrine, and our
   aims in

   conversation, have, though with a mixture of much sinful weakness, been

   sincerely pointed at the honour of the Lord Jesus as our king as well
   as priest, as

   our sanctification as well as our righteousness, we cannot but regret
   our being

   aspersed, as turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and
   casting off the

   obligation of the holy law of the ten commands; being persuaded that
   the

   damnation of such as either do or teach so, is just and unavoidable, if
   mercy

   prevent it not. But now if, after this plain and ingenuous declaration
   of our

   principles, we must still lie under the same load of reproach, it is
   our comfort, that

   we have the testimony of our conscience clearing us in that matter, and
   doubt not

   the Lord will in due time bring forth our righteousness as the light,
   and our

   judgment as the noon-day. We only add, that we adhere to our
   representation and

   petition in all points; and so much the rather that we have already
   observed the

   sad fruits, and bad improvement made of the Assembly's deed, therein

   complained of.
