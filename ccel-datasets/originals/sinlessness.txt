   THE little work now offered to the public has but gradually attained
   its present form. Its substance first appeared as an essay in the
   Studien and Kritiken for 1828, since which time it has undergone many
   alterations, and been enlarged by various additions in the successive
   editions which have been called for.

   In his preface to the sixth edition (1853), the author says that he was
   first led to publish this treatise in a separate form, from the desire
   of showing to others the way by which he had himself been brought to a
   living belief in Christianity, hoping thereby to assist his own
   hearers, and younger theologians in general, in attaining a firmer
   foundation for their faith. The work, however, finding much acceptance
   beyond the circle for which it was chiefly intended, and new editions
   being repeatedly demanded, much new matter was added to meet the
   requirements made by the theological movements of the period, and
   several sections were rewritten.

   Of the present seventh edition, Dr. Ullmann remarks that he has for
   some years delayed responding to the call made for it, because he could
   neither feel satisfied to reprint it with merely unimportant
   corrections, nor find time for such a thorough recasting of the whole
   as he felt desirable. This task has now at last been accomplished. In
   executing it, the author says that it has been his endeavour, first, to
   give, in a more condensed form, such matter as he has retained from
   former editions, and then so to combine with this those new
   portions--of which some have been derived from the works which have
   appeared during the last ten years, while others are the result of his
   own more thorough investigation and mature consideration of his
   subject--that the organic connection of the whole may be everywhere
   maintained. By this process about two-thirds of the sixth edition have
   been either rewritten or are entirely new, while the rest has received
   minor corrections and alterations. The present translation retains such
   passages of the former (by the Rev. R. C. L. Brown) as have been left
   unaltered by the author, and embodies his corrections and additions.

   Amidst the various struggles which the Church has to pass through,'
   says the author, I am fully persuaded that, if its health and vigour
   are to be maintained, the silent labours of theology must not be
   omitted. And I am as certain--nay, I am more deeply penetrated with the
   truth--that as in every age, so also in our own,, the first and chief
   concern is to lead souls to Christ, to implant Him and His salvation in
   the hearts of men. If the work here offered may, in the midst of the
   turmoils of these times, contribute, in ever so small a degree, to
   accomplish this most vital duty of theology, it will not have failed in
   the purpose for which it has been written.'

  FROM THE

PREFACE TO THE SIXTH-EDITION.

   WHEN I first reprinted the present treatise in a separate form from the
   theol. Stud. und Krit., it was specially designed for the use of my own
   pupils and of young theologians in general. I desired to point out to
   them the way in which I had myself been led to a vital interest in
   Christianity, and hoped thus to contribute to the establishment of
   their faith, to encourage them in their studies, and to increase their
   delight in their high and holy calling. Nor have my hopes been
   disappointed. But besides the circle for which it was at first
   designed, this little work has passed into the hands of both
   theological and general readers, and has gained such acceptance that
   repeated editions have been necessary.

   In, preparing this new edition, it was impossible to omit noticing,
   either to refute or to agree with them, the various theories advanced
   by the theological movements which have meanwhile taken place. And how
   varied and eventful has been our experience in this respect since 1828!
   At the same time, it was also necessary to pay due attention to, and to
   profit by, whatever might have been said on our subject by theological
   contemporaries. Thus matter has gradually accumulated, till what was at
   first but an article of moderate compass, has become a complete and
   sizeable volume.

   The demand for a new edition has given me the opportunity of strictly
   revising the whole. In doing this--I will frankly own--I became so
   fully, and in some instances painfully, sensible of the incomplete
   state of the work, that I could not possibly suffer it again to appear
   before the public in a state which, though altered as to certain
   details, was, as a whole, the same as heretofore. The friendly
   reception accorded to it--but, above all, the great importance of the
   subject treated on--made it incumbent upon me to remodel the work, a
   labour which I have been enabled to accomplish.

   In doing this, I found myself obliged to give an entirely new form to
   whole sections, and to endeavour, by copious additions and corrections,
   to improve and complete those parts which I have allowed to remain
   essentially unaltered.

   The parts which have undergone a complete process of recasting are,
   besides the Introduction, chiefly the following:--the chapters and
   sections on Sin, on Sinlessness, on the Gospel Portraiture and
   Self-testimony of Jesus; on the Proofs of the Sinlessness of Jesus
   furnished by the effects of Christianity; on the narrative of the
   Temptation; and especially the whole of the Fourth Part, which treats
   of the inferences to be drawn from the Sinlessness of Jesus. These
   portions I desire most to commend to the reader's investigation, since
   it is with respect to them that I cherish the hope of receiving the
   assistance of either a correction, an expansion, or a refutation of my
   opinions.

   It is not for me to say whether, amidst the present constellation of
   devotional and theological works, this little book will find the
   interest formerly accorded to it. The strife of parties, their internal
   and external contests,--some really necessary, some provoked by
   violence,--have turned attention to other subjects. Besides, many at
   the present day, even among my younger contemporaries, have so
   exclusively surrendered themselves to the forms of a ready-made
   dogmatism--whether the dogmatism of faith or the dogmatism of
   unbelief--as to reject at once all argument and investigation, some
   because they will not admit the need or benefit of furnishing fresh
   proofs of the faith, others because they will have nothing to do with
   faith itself.

   But if I feel uncertain in this respect, there is another in which I
   feel no kind of doubt. I am certain that, if in the midst of all this
   contention the health and vigour of the Christian Church is to be
   maintained, the silent labours of theology must not be intermitted. And
   I am as certain--nay, far more deeply penetrated with the
   certainty--that as in all times, so also in our own, the first and
   essential thing is to bring souls to Christ, to implant Him and His
   salvation in the hearts of men. If this treatise may subserve this, the
   highest object of theology, and contribute to effect it, in ever so
   small a degree, its aim will not be unaccomplished.

PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH EDITION.

   A NEW edition of this book has now for some years been required but,
   notwithstanding the representations of its publisher, I could neither
   find time for such a recompilation as I felt necessary, nor consent to
   a mere reprint, with detached and unimportant corrections. At first, my
   official engagements forbade such an undertaking and subsequently,
   physical ailments interposed to prevent any continuous labour. Thus I
   have been unable till now to complete such improvements as might allow
   me to offer this new edition to the public and I can only wish that the
   many interruptions amidst which this little work has been brought to
   its present state, may be as little perceptible as possible in my
   execution of the task.

   In the present edition my efforts have chiefly been directed to give a
   more concise and distinct form to those portions which I have retained
   from former editions, and at the same time to combine with this such
   new matter as seemed desirable, whether from the works of others, or
   from the results of my own further investigation of the subject during
   the last ten years. I hope this has been done in such a manner as
   nowhere to interfere with the organic connection of the whole. It has
   been my aim that the book, while losing none of its essential contents,
   should, in spite of the addition of new elements, be at once more brief
   and more lucid, and, above all, that its fundamental thought should be
   more clearly developed and more conclusively argued.

   How far this may have been attained, it is not for me, but for
   intelligent readers, to determine.

   My wishes for its success naturally accompany the work in its present,
   as in its former state yet I do not allow myself to cherish any
   sanguine hopes with respect to non-theological readers. I am well
   convinced, indeed, that there are among these many who will not give up
   the name of Christians, and who will consent to a Christianity which
   accommodates itself with but very little scruple to the humanitarian
   notions of the age. But I see, too, that matters take quite a different
   turn when Christianity appears, not perhaps as a mere dogmatical
   system, but in the simple and unadulterated form in which it was
   delivered to the world by its Founder and first confessors, and
   especially when it advances those great and deep-reaching moral claims
   which are absolutely inseparable from its very nature. A willingness to
   receive it in this form involves more than a wish just to maintain an
   amicable relation thereto it implies a mind earnestly striving after
   eternal happiness,--a mind estimating the invisible inheritance above
   all visible possessions, and therefore capable of the greatest
   sacrifices, especially the sacrifice of self, for its attainment in
   short, it implies the felt need of salvation.

   That the number of such earnest seekers is in our days a large, or even
   an increasing one, I cannot, so far as my acquaintance with the
   religious and intellectual condition of the age extends, persuade
   myself. And since this treatise, though based only upon the general
   principles of morality, has nevertheless no other end in view than the
   advocacy of that primitive and scriptural Christianity, with its
   positive. creed and its moral demands upon the obedience of the whole
   human race, I cannot venture to anticipate for it, in this respect, a
   very favourable reception.

   Yet I do not doubt that there are, in the different classes of society,
   many in whom the above named predisposition towards Christian truth
   exists, but who have not yet been able to find a corresponding access
   thereto. To such, as well as to theologians, I would again address
   myself by means of this little work; and if it may, by God's blessing,
   be useful to them, be they few or many, I shall have abundant cause for
   gratitude.

     __________________________________________________________________

                                 INTRODUCTION.

   THE idea of sinlessness being the starting-point of the following
   treatise, it is of the first necessity to point out that this word is
   not used in the merely negative sense of an absence of antagonism to
   the Divine law, but in its essentially positive meaning of actual
   conformity to the will of God. Sinlessness, according to our view of
   it, is a state in which man occupies that position with respect to the
   order of life appointed by God, nay, rather to the holy God Himself,
   which alone becomes a being endued with personality, and created in the
   Divine image. Sinlessness, taken in this sense, is the culminating
   point of human development. It is a perfection both religious and
   moral, not merely resulting from complete conformity to a Divine type,
   but itself inherent it is perfect and complete holiness. The very
   notion of such a quality is highly significant, and is at once both
   elevating and humbling. Elevating, because it brings before the mind
   the highest attainment it can possibly conceive. For the moral sense of
   every one will tell him, that if a man were perfectly sinless, he would
   be in the state to which, as a human being, he is really destined would
   need no wealth to be truly rich, no sword to be a hero, no crown to be
   a king. He would be in possession of that truth which is at the same
   time the highest wisdom, and of that purity which is of itself both
   peace and happiness. But not less is. the thought a humbling and
   depressing one for it is ever directly connected with the conviction
   that we are by no means free from sin, but that rather, if we say we
   have no sin, we do but deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
   There is between the goal set before us by our destination, and the
   actual attainment of our life, a great gulf, which we are forced to
   confess we are utterly incapable of passing over by any power of our
   own.

   But we are not about to treat of a mere idea, but of a reality,--of the
   appearance, in the midst of the history of the sinful human race, of a
   genuine and actual personality, of whose perfect and spotless holiness
   we have most incontestable evidence. It is this fact which gives its
   full importance to our subject. For freedom from sin, perfect
   righteousness, or whatever other term may be used to express the
   notion, was by no means utterly unknown, as a general idea, whether to
   the præ-Christian or the heathen world. Some notion of the kind is seen
   to hover over the altitudes reached even by Pagan wisdom, while the
   prophetic writings of the Old Testament refer to it with far greater
   distinctness. But as a reality, as filled with vital energy, and
   especially as bringing forth actual results, it is found only in
   Christianity, nay, even in Christianity only in one solitary instance,
   in the person of the Author and Finisher of the Christian faith--in
   Christ Jesus.

   It is obvious that a quality thus significant in itself, peculiar to
   Christianity, and realized therein as an actual phenomenon only in one
   single Person, must be of the highest importance, if we are rightly to
   appreciate either the character of that Person Himself, or the entire
   sphere of life called into existence by Him, viz. Christianity in
   general. No one can dispute that the tenet of the sinlessness of Christ
   is deeply rooted in the Christian faith, and has grown up as an
   intrinsic part of it. It forms, whether as a necessary postulate or a
   self-evident conclusion, so essential a portion of Christian doctrine,
   and especially of the doctrine of the person and work of the Redeemer,
   that it is impossible to remove it without the destruction of the
   entire edifice. Hence the decisive importance of this point of
   Christian belief has at no time been misconceived, whether in the first
   ages of the Church, during the medieval era, or in the present days.

   Nevertheless it is not--as the reader is requested to observe--from
   this point of view, viz. the doctrinal, that we propose to treat the
   subject. It is rather an apologetic aim which we exclusively set before
   us in our treatment of this matter, and that more expressly and
   entirely than has as yet been done by other writers. [1] The office of
   Theology is scientifically to arrange and expound, according to their
   internal connection and perfect organization, those matters of
   Christian belief which have been previously established and determined.
   It is that of Apologetics, on the contrary, to maintain the Christian
   standpoint with regard to what is external thereto, and to justify it
   in the presence of such objections as may arise, and thus to furnish
   the means of entrance to those who are without. If this distinction
   between these respective departments be kept in view, our meaning and
   intentions cannot but be plainly perceived. We would in fact view the
   sinlessness of Christ, not as a single doctrine, which, in its
   connection with other doctrines, is one of intrinsic and imperative
   necessity in the entire organism of the Christian faith; but as a fact,
   whose authenticity must in the first place be independently
   established. When this has been done, we may proceed to show that it is
   one involving the most important and far-reaching inferences with
   respect to the person and work of Christ,--nay, with respect to the
   whole system of the Christian faith. That the sinless perfection of
   Christ is, however, of fundamental importance, especially in our days,
   may easily be made apparent in a preliminary and more general sketch,
   by taking a closer survey of the special aim of Apologetics. This aim
   is a far higher one than merely to prove that Christianity is in its
   own nature better and truer than other religions, and has contributed
   far more than they have done to the progress of mankind. For
   Christianity professes to be not merely a religion endowed with
   pre-eminent excellences with respect to, and among other religions, but
   declares itself the religion, the absolutely perfect religion, which
   alone fulfils the conditions, and furnishes the means, by which the
   whole human race may be saved,--the exclusively divine revelation and
   plan of salvation. To exhibit and prove it to be such, is the goal
   which the apologist must ever keep in view.

   But a religion is not proved to be the absolutely perfect one, by
   merely showing that it furnishes true doctrine and a faultless code of
   morals, and that it has produced many beneficial results. The Greeks
   might have taught a far deeper philosophy than the Platonic or
   Aristotelian,--the Jews might have had purer doctrines and precepts
   than those of even Moses and the Prophets; and yet they would not,
   therefore, have been in possession of the true religion. Nay, even
   Christianity itself might have furnished, in the Sermon on the Mount,
   the parables, and other teachings of Christ and His apostles, the
   sublimest religious material conceivable, and have even brought mighty
   things to pass thereby; but if this had been all, it would still have
   been far from satisfying man's deepest need, from filling up the chasm
   existing between human nature and the holy God, and from exhibiting
   that culminating point of religious development, which cannot possibly
   be surpassed.

   Religion--as no one in the present day will deny--is not merely a
   system of doctrine or a code of morality. It must indeed have both, and
   both must be deducible from its inner life; but it cannot be maintained
   that either one or the other, or even both together, really is true
   religion. It is not in a summary of ideas, doctrines, and moral
   postulates, floating, as it were, over our life and influencing it from
   without, that the special and intrinsic nature of true religion
   consists, but in being a reality born into life itself,--an effectual
   all-influencing power therein. True religion is the real bond of union
   between God and man; it is that position of the personal creature with
   respect to the personal Creator by which the whole life of the former,
   from its inmost centre, is fashioned and determined, and in which that
   life has its true purpose and existence. It is this true position of
   man to God which must more especially be brought about wherever true,
   perfect religion is said to have appeared. And this cannot be effected
   by merely teaching or commanding it, but only by living therein in the
   presence, as it were, of the whole human race, Hence its original form,
   its mode of revelation, must naturally and necessarily have been a
   personal one, exhibited in the entire life of a personal Being. There
   must be a Man who is Himself religious, religion incarnate and
   impersonate, in whom the true relation between God and man has become
   an absolute and perceptible reality, and through whom the restoration
   of this relation is made an actual possibility to the whole fallen and
   sinful human race.

   By what distinctive mark, then, shall we chiefly recognise this
   personal Being, thus revealing and founding the perfect religion and by
   what means will such a Being be most certainly authenticated? Clearly
   our most trustworthy sign will be the utter absence of that which
   separates man from God, even of sin,--the leading of a perfectly pure
   and holy life, and a consequent abiding in that vital union with God,
   by means of which, power to eradicate sin and its consequences, and to
   create in man a new and holy life, may be attained. For only One thus
   holy and sinless, entering into all the conditions and conflicts of
   human life, and when suffering, suffering not for His own guilt, but
   that of His brethren, could be able to reconcile the discord between
   the holy God and sinful humanity, and in such wise to purify the
   latter, as forthwith to implant, in the place of sin, a life of true
   holiness. But if once the true relation between God and man were
   brought to pass by such a Being, if once access to God were opened to
   all, and the power of divine renovation bestowed upon the human race,
   this cannot be repeated,--it would be done once for all; and that
   culminating point would be attained with regard to religion, to which
   indeed mankind may, in the process of its development, thenceforth
   progressively approximate, but which it will be impossible to surpass;
   in other words, the perfect religion would be for ever existent in
   living and personal realization.

   We say, then, that the perfect revelation and the procuring of
   salvation can only be effected by means of a Person, and that a Person
   of sinless holiness. But then, too, on the other hand, we may affirm
   that if we can find such a Person, one really proved to have been in
   all respects sinlessly perfect, we have every reason for believing that
   in Him we actually possess a perfect revelation of the divine means of
   salvation, and have therefore attained the culminating point of vital
   religion. Hence all that proceeds from, or is connected with this
   Person, will bear for us the impress of an authority far surpassing any
   other.

   Now such a Person is presented to us by Christianity in its Founder. It
   is not this or that doctrine, though of ever so fundamental importance,
   not this or that special fact, though of ever so decisive a nature, but
   Himself, the personal Christ, that is the vital centre of Christianity,
   the pulsating heart from which all proceeds, and to which all returns.
   There is no other religion in which the person of its founder occupies
   so central, so all-controlling, so all-pervading a position,--none into
   which it is so inseparably interwoven. Here, as nowhere besides, the
   divine revelation is a personal one,--the salvation, one wrought by
   means of a person. It is, however, obvious, that where the divinity of
   His work and Person is in question, there is one special point which
   must in the last instance be a decisive one, and that is the great
   subject of His sinless perfection.

   This question has, under all circumstances, been one of the deepest
   importance with regard to the stability of the Christian faith. For
   even if the sinless perfection of Christ be not itself the very highest
   fact or central point of Christianity, it is yet most intimately
   connected with its highest and most central articles of faith,
   especially with the divine-human person of Jesus Christ and His work of
   redemption, and forms a foundation not only indispensable to the entire
   edifice, but also so constituted as to form a point of special
   illumination, from which those facts which are above and beyond itself
   may be inferred, and to which, on the other hand, they may, by reason
   of a vital connection, be referred.

   If there were substantial grounds for rejecting His sinless perfection,
   the Founder of Christianity must descend from that all-surpassing
   eminence on which Christian faith has from the very first beheld Him,
   and mingle in the ranks of other mortals, as one perhaps of prominent
   moral excellence and superior wisdom, yet still as one yielding homage
   to the power of sin. He would not then be even, in the full meaning of
   the term, the Son of man, the realized prototype of mankind, and the
   spiritual progenitor of a renewed race, well-pleasing to God, still
   less the only-begotten Son of God of the apostolic faith, and, least of
   all, the Reconciler of sinful man with the Holy God, and the
   all-sufficient Redeemer from sin and death for all times and
   generations. Not only would the Church which is built upon Him be
   standing upon an insecure foundation, but the Christian faith itself
   would have lost all solid basis.

   If, on the other hand, the sinlessness of Jesus is proved by convincing
   reasons, He is then beheld as the one perfect man, raised to a moral
   elevation above the whole sinful race. Then there really is. in Him a
   perfect and new moral creation, and the foundation for a similar new
   creation of the entire race. Then we have in this fact a pledge of the
   certainty of that whole summary of doctrines which has from the very
   first made Him the object of Christian faith, especially for His Divine
   Sonship and work of redemption according to apostolic testimony. Then,
   too, the ancient faith still rests upon a good foundation, and the
   Church which has grown out of it has still such a vitality, that all
   the powers of darkness and unbelief shall not prevail against it.

   Of such critical importance is the question of the sinless holiness of
   Christ. It is a question of the very existence or non-existence of
   Christianity itself. If there are no certain grounds for affirming the
   sinlessness of Jesus, the moral basis of Christianity is itself
   insecure. If, on the contrary, the faith in His sinless perfection is
   proved to be well founded, it becomes at the same time a firm
   foundation-stone for the whole edifice of the Christian faith.

   We have now, as it seems to us, sufficiently pointed out the chief
   features of the aim we propose to ourselves. Perhaps, however, we may
   be permitted to preface the following pages by a few more remarks,
   which may contribute to the appreciation of their contents.

   In making the sinless perfection of Christ our starting-point for a
   vindication of the Christian faith, we would by no means be understood
   to regard it as the only valid mode of proof, or to esteem all others
   slight in comparison. There is in Christianity so great an exuberance
   of life, and so many points at which it comes in contact with minds of
   every kind, that it cannot but offer many ways of access to its inner
   sanctuary; and every way must be welcomed which does but really lead to
   a sound and vital faith. At the same time it will be granted that
   different ages and different individuals have different needs; and our
   age, whose tendencies are eminently moral, practical, and historical,
   has its own special claim, which we believe will be best met in the
   path upon which we are about to enter.

   The evidence derived from miracles and prophecy, which has hitherto
   been that most frequently adduced, must ever maintain its value so long
   as it occupies its true position, and is surrounded by its fitting
   adjuncts. It has, moreover, in its favour the example of our Lord
   Himself and His apostles. But there is an evident difference in this
   respect between the contemporaries and fellow-countrymen of Christ and
   us moderns, who are, moreover, the children of an essentially different
   sphere of culture. The former stood directly and independently upon the
   platform of faith in the Old Testament, and had either seen miracles
   themselves, or had received testimony of such occurrences from
   eye-witnesses. With us, on the contrary, faith in the Old Testament has
   to be founded upon the appearance and authority of Christ, while, with
   respect to miracles, the case is, that we are far more likely to accept
   the miracles of Christ for the sake of His person, than to believe in
   His person for the sake of His miracles. Miracles and predictions, too,
   ever refer to the person of Christ, or proceed from it. Hence that
   which is most essential and decisive is this personality itself, which
   in the first instance supports, causes, and casts a true light upon,
   all else. It is to this, in its moral and religious value, that even
   miracle and prophecy finally refer us and its peculiar, nay, its
   utterly unique nature, must, after all, ever remain the firmest support
   of the Christian faith; for here we have within the sphere of
   Christianity that which least needs extraneous testimony to its
   indwelling truth and excellence,--that which is, on the contrary, in
   the highest degree self-evidencing, and cannot fail of making an
   impression upon such an age as ours, more powerfully influenced, as it
   ever is in such cases, by moral views and motives than by any other.

   To this must be added the specially practical advantage involved in,
   and connected with, the anode of proof which we are thus adducing for
   the production of faith, or at least of a disposition and inclination
   to faith; namely, that it bases belief directly upon the object of
   faith itself, upon the person of Christ, and that chiefly in its moral
   aspect.

   Christianity, as is universally acknowledged, is of a more thoroughly
   ethical character than any other religion. It addresses chiefly the
   heart, the conscience, the will of man. It would beget in him, not
   merely a correct knowledge of Divine things, but a new life; it would
   make the whole man, from the very deepest centre of his moral life to
   the whole circumference of his practice, other than he is by nature.
   Hence, even the entrance of the individual into the sphere of
   Christianity is not brought about by a process of reasoning, but by a
   change of life. There is, as one has well said, indeed an up-breaking,
   but it is an up-breaking not of the head, but of the heart. The first
   step in this process is a man's felt conviction of his sinfulness, and
   of his inability to effect his own salvation; the second, his believing
   acceptance of the salvation graciously offered him in Christ, and his
   attainment thereby of the power of leading a new life. Thus the old
   apostolic way of repentance and faith is the only one in which the
   eternal salvation given in Christianity can be really acquired. The
   evidences of Christianity are incapable of making any man truly a
   Christian; for this, after all, is a work to be effected not by men,
   but by God. Yet evidences may contribute to it, by clearing away
   opposing obstacles, by increasing the mind's inclination to accept the
   grace of God; and they will do this the more effectually, the more they
   are of such a nature as to make a near approach to that which
   constitutes the pole upon which the actual entrance into Christianity
   turns. Of such a nature is especially that kind of evidence of which we
   here propose to treat.

   If we are to be assured of the sinless perfection of the Lord Jesus, it
   must be made evident to us that He was faultless during the whole
   course of His life. Hence, in affirming His sinlessness, we shall needs
   first of all, to exhibit such a portraiture of the life of Christ, as
   may present us with a true and lively representation of the chief
   features of His character. This very portraiture, moreover, bears
   within it a power quite peculiar of convincing a man of his sinfulness,
   as well as of leading him to Christ as his Saviour. The image of the
   pure and holy One touches, as nothing else can do, our moral
   consciousness. It presents before us a conscience which actually
   existed uninvolved in intricacies, uncorrupted by temptations and
   nothing in the whole world has equal power with this image, when it
   becomes a living reality in our heart, to cast down all our
   imaginations of our own virtue or merit, and to humble our inmost
   nature before God. But this image of Him who was absolutely pure, is at
   the same time the image of the Only-Begotten, full of grace and truth.
   Hence it has the power not merely of casting us down, but of raising us
   up, of inducing us to surrender ourselves in trust and confidence to
   that fulness of Divine love which is reflected therein as in an
   unsullied mirror. It is Christ Himself who thus lays hold of us, and
   begins to attain a form within us, while we, on our part, enter within
   the radius of His creative operations, and therefore within the sphere
   of Christian faith and life.

   Thus this kind of evidence, while it objectively justifies the
   Christian faith, is at the same time that which is most adapted--so far
   as this can by such means be effected--subjectively to excite or
   cherish it, by preparing a way of entrance into the mind for that holy
   Personality who is the object of this faith.

   It only remains briefly to point out the course we propose to follow in
   the following pages.

   We start, then, from the phenomenon presented by the merely human life
   of Jesus. In this we have a stable and independent point of
   Christianity, comprehensible to all, and calculated to gain access to
   minds of the most opposite constitutions; a point which cannot fail of
   producing an impression wherever general moral earnestness and a
   feeling for purity and holiness exist, and which is of equal
   significance for men of the most exalted, and of the meanest
   intellectual attainments. We shall not, however, consider this
   phenomenon as an isolated one; but, while seeking to maintain it, shall
   be ever keeping in view our further aim,--the establishment of the
   Christian faith in general. And in this we are justified by the very
   nature of our subject. For it is this very moral phenomenon, presented
   by the human life of Jesus, which is so constituted, that it is
   impossible to stop at accepting it as a bare fact. Starting therefrom,
   a very little reflection will necessarily drive us to conclusions of
   the last importance with regard to the deepest and sublimest doctrines
   of Christianity.

   Hence the matter of the present treatise will naturally consist of two
   main subjects:--First, that Jesus was indeed the sinlessly Holy One
   which Christianity, on scriptural grounds, acknowledges Him to have
   been. Secondly, that this acknowledgment involves most important
   consequences, justifying our faith in Him as the Son of God, and
   Redeemer of mankind, and in, the fundamental truths of Christianity in
   general.

   We shall not, however, be able to confine ourselves to the simple
   establishment of the fact of His sinlessness, and to drawing the
   inferences resulting therefrom. Before entering upon our first subject,
   it will be desirable to define more exactly what we mean by
   sinlessness, and thus to enter into some discussion upon this notion;
   and before passing on to our second, we must not shun the task of
   defending our assertion of Christ's sinlessness, against the objections
   by which it has been assailed. Not till this has been done, shall we
   have obtained a firm foundation for those apologetic inferences which
   will naturally form the conclusion of the whole.

   Thus the first section will treat of the notion of sinlessness in
   general; the second, of Jesus Christ as actually sinless; the third, of
   the objections made against His sinlessness; and the fourth, of the
   conclusions to be drawn therefrom.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] As it is my intention to deal more completely with the history and
   literature of the subject in an appendix, I shall here confine myself
   to a short statement of its most recent treatment. Among theologians of
   our own days, it is acknowledged that it was Schleiermacher who first
   effectually asserted the fundamental importance of the sinfulness or
   sinlessness of Christ. He did this, however, chiefly in a doctrinal
   point of view; hence an apologetic use of the subject, which
   necessarily demanded an entirely different treatment, yet remained to
   be made. I first attempted to supply this need in the year 1828, in an
   article on the Sinlessness of Christ,' in the Theologischen Studien and
   Kritiken. From this article the present work has, by means of a series
   of alterations and additions, been elaborated. Since that period, this
   important question has been frequently discussed by other Protestant
   theologians from the apologetic point of view; and that not merely in
   Germany, but in other countries where a lively interest is taken in the
   development of modern theology. Among the works which have been written
   on this subject, that of Dorner, On the Sinless Perfection of Christ,
   Gotha 1828, occupies a high position. I would also direct attention to
   the following:--The Moral Character of Christ, or the Perfection of
   Christ's Humanity a proof of His Divinity, 1861, by Phil. Schaff,
   Professor of Theology at the Theological Seminary of Mercersburg; The
   Christ of History: An Argument grounded on the Facts of His Life on
   Earth, Edinburgh 1856, by John Young, LL.D.; Chaps. x. and xi. of
   Nature and the Supernatural, etc., New York 1858, by Horace Bushnell;
   Essai sur la Divinité du Caractère Morale de Jesus Christ, Genève 1850,
   by E. Dandiran; Le Redempteur, Paris 1854, by E. Pressensé. Fel.
   Pecaut, a Frenchman, has, on the other hand, come forward as a decided
   sceptic of the sinlessness of Christ, in his work, Le Christ et le
   Conscience, Paris 1859. The treatise of Keim, too, On the Human
   Development of Christ, Zurich 1861, and Gess's Lehre von der Person
   Christi, Basel 1856, bear also upon the subject. Compare also in
   general all the works on the life of Christ which have appeared since
   Strauss; among which I would call special attention to the Lectures of
   Riggenbach, Basel 1858, Lect. x. I shall adduce other works as
   opportunity may offer.

THE IDEA OF SINLESSNESS.

   WE must not omit to define more exactly than we have done in the
   Introduction, what we understand by the word sinlessness when we apply
   it to the Lord Jesus. It is evident, however, that the full
   signification of this expression can only be arrived at by the
   definition of its opposite,--viz. sin. Nor can its real importance be
   appreciated, till the nature of sin, and its power over mankind, are
   perceived. Hence this section will treat upon two subjects,--first,
   upon the nature and power of sin, then upon what is to be understood by
   the term sinlessness.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I.

   OF SIN.

   THE idea of sin [2] can only exist where a Divine rule of life, and a
   highest aim of human existence resulting therefrom, are recognised. The
   recognition of both, however, is part of the very nature of reason,
   which ever requires, in the last instance, connection, conformity to
   law, and eternal constancy; and must deny itself by seeing, in the
   whole sphere of existence, only the aimless, unmeaning sport of
   accident or caprice.

   We cannot conceive of the order of the world otherwise than as an
   all-including unity. There cannot be two different orders of the world,
   there can be but one; nor can this have different ends,--it must have
   one supreme end. But this one world-order unfolds itself in different
   spheres: it unfolds itself as the order of nature, in which force
   reigns, and as the order of moral life, where liberty rules.

   In the domain of nature, everything that takes place is accomplished by
   a necessity in the things themselves; and even in those cases where we
   discover something resembling freedom, as in the actions of animals, it
   must be borne in mind that even their impulses spring from a mere
   unconscious natural desire, that is, instinct. Now we call that which
   thus operates in the domain of natural life a law of nature. This law
   of nature is not, however, a power acting from without, but it is the
   nature and constitution of the things themselves making itself
   irresistibly felt. Therefore, here the law is immediately one with its
   fulfilment; nor can there ever be a contradiction between the two.
   Hence, also, when apparent deviations from the ordinary course occur,
   when dangerous and destructive agencies enter in, we cannot speak of
   imputation or of guilt in this province, because nature does only what
   she cannot help doing, and therefore remains guiltless.

   The marvels of this course of nature, with its connection and
   consistency in all its parts, from the scarcely perceptible atom to the
   sun-systems in their unchanging paths, are innumerable. But, in the
   midst of these miracles of nature, there arises a miracle greater
   still. It is the miracle of a will which interrupts the course of
   nature; it is free personality making her subject to mind. On the basis
   of the life of nature there rises up a moral life,--an ethical kingdom
   within the kingdom of nature. Of necessity an order must reign within
   this kingdom too. It were folly, indeed, to suppose that this most
   wondrous cosmical arrangement existed for no other purpose than to
   furnish a theatre on which the rule of caprice might be displayed; that
   preparations so pregnant with design should issue in results void of
   reason or purpose. But the order to be established here will
   undoubtedly differ radically from the order of nature. Thus, moral
   personality (even although situated in the midst of the course of
   nature) still possesses a full consciousness that it is not ruled
   thereby, nor can be, but that it has in it a principle which is
   determined by a power beyond and above nature. And this principle is
   free-will. The order which rules in this domain is free, like that will
   itself; it is not established by force. The law is not summarily
   enforced: it must be acknowledged and received by the will of him who
   is subject to it. But the law may not be thus accepted,--a contrary
   line of action may be chosen: hence the possibility of coming into
   collision with the law, and of a consequent disturbance of order, not
   now an apparent disturbance merely (as in nature), but a real one. And
   this disturbance, although it may, by the hand of the Almighty
   Disposer, be converted into a means of good, and thus be ultimately
   made serviceable to the cause of order, does nevertheless carry along
   with it, to him who commits it, the character of responsibility and
   guilt, because it is the act of his free choice.

   In the order of nature, law does not appear as duty, because it is
   directly self-fulfilling. In the moral order, on the contrary, it
   becomes, under certain conditions, duty, because here the law, and the
   will which performs that law, may be separate. When the law
   commands--when it is obliged to take the form of Thou shalt!'--this
   argues an unsatisfactory moral condition; for where the moral condition
   is what it should be, law does not come as a power from without
   enforcing obedience, but is the indwelling principle of action. Not
   that this state involves actual opposition to the moral order; for it
   is possible that due obedience may be rendered to law even when it
   comes from without, and assumes an authoritative attitude. Real
   opposition arises only when the personal will refuses obedience to law,
   which it yet clearly understands, and performs the very reverse of what
   it enjoins. [3] This is what we call transgression, disobedience to
   law, when relating to others, unrighteousness and--to express the
   notion generally--sin. [4] But this definition is entirely formal and
   external: we must therefore look for other particulars, which regard
   not merely the form of action, but its substance, and which relate to
   action not merely as such, but in its inward and abiding source.

   In the first place, it is evident that sin, being a deviation from the
   true order of life, is also a falling short and a failure of the end
   which that order has in view, of the true destination of man. [5] It is
   a want of goodness; and since goodness in itself has a blessing and
   ennobling effect upon life, without it there is no true life; that is,
   sin divests life of its completeness and its blessedness. But it would
   be false to conclude from this, that sin is nothing more than
   limitation, restriction, negation. The negation that is in sin turns
   naturally into something positive, something positively wrong; and
   indeed it implies this. Even sins of omission are not merely negative,
   much less are actual sins. Only in one case could sin be regarded as
   something merely negative, that is, if the Will that would not choose
   the good could at once suspend its activity altogether, and will
   nothing at all. But the Will can never will absolutely nothing: when it
   shuts itself against the good, it inevitably chooses its opposite; when
   it contemns order, It surrenders itself to caprice; when it thrusts
   from it the true principle of life, it admits a false one in its place.
   Thus sin is not only a coming-short of the true goal, but a tendency
   towards a wrong one; not merely an interruption, but. a perversion; not
   merely a pause in the advance towards goodness, but an apostasy from
   goodness. [6] Are lying and cheating, gluttony and debauchery, envy and
   hatred, to be regarded as the mere absence of truth and uprightness, of
   moderation and chastity, of benevolence and brotherly love, or perhaps
   even as but very important stages in the development of these virtues,
   and not, on the contrary, as their most positive contrasts? In fact
   there must be an utter absence of all perception of the actual presence
   of sin in mankind,--of sin rising, as it does in many instances, to
   obdurate antagonism to all that is good and holy,--where its positive
   character is denied.

   But it is not merely those actions which meet the eye that we must here
   bring under notice: the important matter is the inward source from
   which they proceed. It is only by fixing our attention upon that, that
   we can attain a clear idea of the nature of sin. Tao often does it
   happen that details hide from our view the whole: content to
   contemplate the phenomena, we forget the substance. So, too, in the
   case before us. We own the existence of sins,--that no man would deny;
   but of sin we will hear nothing. And yet sin is the root from which all
   acts of sin shoot forth; and the man who will not go beyond the latter,
   but stops short at faults and failings, transgressions and crimes,
   without penetrating to their source,--the perverted will, which is the
   source of all the evil,--must crime to a conclusion as destitute of.
   wisdom and insight, as that of a physician whose diagnosis goes no
   further than the symptoms of the disease, and leaves its hidden causes
   unexplored. All the external actions of a man are the result of an
   internal antecedent; and that which is, in a moral point of view, alone
   decisive of the character .of an action, is the inward motive from
   which it proceeds. Moral order does indeed furnish us also with an
   objective standard; but whenever the question is one of the relation of
   the individual to moral order, everything depends upon the disposition
   of the mind; and it is not that which is palpable, that which may be
   the subject of human measurement, which is of primary importance. It is
   not the quantity of deeds done that imparts to them a character of
   merit or demerit: much more is it the quality and worth of those
   actions, as estimated by the spirit which they embody and reflect. And
   as this is true of goodness, so is it also of evil. The degree of
   heinousness of even outward acts of sin is determined by that which
   constitutes their inward motive. There may be sinful frames and
   dispositions which are scarcely perceptible in the external life, and
   which are yet the results of the deepest moral depravity; [7] and a
   murder might, under certain circumstances, entail less guilt than the
   slanderous word which slays a reputation.

   But if we fix our earnest attention upon the real inner source of sin,
   we shall not run the risk of adopting that false method of viewing it,
   which looks no further than its isolated external manifestations. The
   whole of life, and of moral life in particular, developes itself
   systematically; its several parts are intimately bound up together, and
   form one whole. Only the most thoughtless folly could for a moment
   entertain the opinion that a human being can, in virtue of his moral
   liberty, perpetrate in wanton caprice, first an action truly good, and
   then immediately thereafter an evil action. This may indeed appear at
   times to occur: we sometimes see an action that we should pronounce
   generous and noble in the midst of a course of conduct undoubtedly bad;
   sometimes, again, we mark an unexpected fall in the midst of an
   honourable life. But though such occurrences may appear to us abrupt
   and isolated, it does not follow that there is this absence of
   connection with the rest of the life, because we fail to perceive it.
   In truth, everything that a man does, comes from his whole nature: his
   actions are nothing else but the occasional expressions of that
   nature,--intimations to the world without of what is going on within.
   And this is especially the case in the matter of sin. Every sin has its
   antecedents, as well as its consequents. Every sin springs from
   spiritual blindness, and works spiritual blindness in its turn: it is a
   daughter of lust, and it becomes in its turn the mother of still more
   powerful lust. [8] If sin have once entered into the sphere of mortal
   life, it is all over with its purity; and the state of perfect
   innocence can never be restored. It produces a shadow upon the moral
   consciousness, and an inclination to continue such a course of action.
   Sin is born from sin, and sin punishes itself by sin. Sin, even when
   cured, leaves its scars, and can never be so obliterated from the
   consciousness as though it had never existed. That, however, which
   connects together separate and single sins, is just the sinful nature,
   or sin considered as the principle from which all sinful actions flow.
   [9]

   These definitions of sin are in close connection with the nature of the
   moral law. The fact that we cannot rightly -estimate the moral
   character, except in so far as we have respect to its internal nature,
   and regard it as a whole, has-its explanation in this, that the law is
   itself the expression of an inner life, and that a consistent and
   connected life. Nor can appearances be allowed to deceive us here
   either. It is true that the law, especially the revealed law, may come
   to us, in the first instance, as a demand from without. Not the less on
   that account has it really taken its rise from a source within, from a
   spiritual life and it is that life which impresses upon the law that
   proceeds from it the character of righteousness and holiness, for the
   purpose of producing a similar life in those to whom it is given. It is
   true the law may come in the form of a number of separate injunctions
   and commands; but these have their true significance only as members of
   a complete organic whole, as component parts of the one commandment of
   perfect love towards God and our neighbour, in which the law is summed
   up, which demands not so much the observance of details, as obedience
   to the whole, and regards the transgression of a single command as a
   violation of the entire law, as a renunciation of its spirit and
   principle. [10] Now, since the law seeks to mould and fashion the whole
   nature of the inward life, and since it does so as an indivisible
   whole, everything depends on the relation of man to the law and its
   principle,--on the one hand in his inmost affections, and on the other,
   in the sum-total of those outward actions which result therefrom. And
   the relation can, in reality, be only one of two kinds: either it is a
   relation of self-renunciation and. obedience, or it is a relation of
   resistance and disobedience. All good springs from the former,--all
   evil from the latter. [11] But the one as well as the other is a
   fundamental fact of the moral life, which must exist before the
   separate acts of will and separate deeds of good can in either case
   take place. In this connection, sin is defined as disobedience. [12]
   The disobedience is not, however, merely in the external action, and
   against the external precept,--it is disobedience in the heart and
   against the whole law, and it is a spirit of disobedience by virtue of
   an internal opposition to the principle expressed by the moral law.

   But if we would understand the true nature of sin, we must not stop at
   mere law. We must first of all inquire what is the origin of law, and
   the end it has in view; for law does not appoint itself, but must be
   appointed. Behind every law there is a life of which it is the
   expression, and a. power of which it is the command. In the case of the
   moral law, the life it expresses cannot be merely the life of nature,
   nor the power by which it is enforced merely the power of nature. The
   moral, from its very nature, transcends the merely natural the unity of
   the law has for its foundation the unity of a consciousness from which
   it proceeded and only a personal will can address itself to our will
   with the command, Thou shalt! There must, then, be a personal,
   conscious, absolutely moral life, exalted above nature, from which the
   law springs.

   Will it perhaps be asserted that it is man himself who gives himself
   the law, and that he bears to himself first the relation of lawgiver,
   and then of law-obeyer? The natural moral law (as it is called), the
   law of conscience, has been indeed brought forward in this sense, and a
   system built up, according to which man is his own moral governor and
   lawgiver. But the moral law cannot be derived from such a source, nor
   even the so-called natural law. Conscience is not the source of moral
   principles, but the regulator of moral action. Besides, the material of
   which it is composed is not absolutely and under all circumstances the
   same, nor derived from its own resources, but rather furnished from a
   source external to itself, and hence differing according to the measure
   of religious development. The conscience of the true Christian is not
   merely more cultivated, but may be said to be of more intrinsic value
   than that of a heathen or a Jew. Hence it is not the primary function
   of conscience to lay down a moral law, but to bear its emphatic
   testimony thereto in special cases, by urgent exhortation to that which
   is lawful, by stern warning against its opposite, and by direct
   reaction against all infraction. [13] Moreover, it is essential to
   conscience, that its commands and prohibitions should be absolute; that
   its voice should assert its authority as a voice of God, as a
   revelation of the Divine righteousness and holiness within us; and that
   all opposition thereto should be perceived to be not merely man's
   opposition to his own better nature, not merely an injury done to
   himself, but a violation of the Divine order, and a resistance to God
   Himself. Thus does conscience--far from corroborating the notion of
   human autonomy--refer us rather to a far higher source of law than a
   merely human one.

   A similar result ensues from the very nature of the subject. For
   wherever in the sphere of life we find an all-powerful and universal
   law enforcing itself, we are compelled to acknowledge that it has
   sprung from the very same source from which that life itself is
   derived. It follows that the source of both the law and the life must
   be something higher than either, and lie beyond the sphere of that
   life. It is the power which determined the conditions under which that
   life is intended to unfold itself and fulfil its destiny, and under
   which alone it can do so. The plant, the animal, or the star, did not
   choose for itself its law of life, but received it from that creative
   Power which gave it being; and it is because that Power is Omnipotence
   that the laws it has implanted work with undeviating certainty. The
   same holds true of man and his order of life; only with this
   difference, that in his case that order is one of liberty, because it
   is a moral order. If man had been his own creator, he might have been
   his own lawgiver. But this not being the case, the law of his life must
   have its origin in that creative power in which his existence is rooted
   and grounded. [14] It is, moreover, on this fact alone that the
   authority and majesty, the eternal validity, and the sacred
   inviolability of the law, depends. Further, it is only under this
   condition that man can possibly entertain that faith in the absolute,
   final victory of the good over the evil, which is indispensable to all
   moral life. For, in order to have that faith, it is not enough to know
   that the good has a certain authority and supreme right given it by
   man. No; we must possess a much higher assurance; we must be convinced
   that the final triumph of goodness is a part of the grand world-plan;
   that the great design of creation, the reason for which the world
   exists, is, that goodness may come to its full realization. And this
   certainty can be gained only from the conviction that the moral law of
   human life has its source in the very same power which called the whole
   economy of the world into existence, and which is conducting it to its
   goal. If, then, the moral law be necessarily derived from a personal
   Being, even from Him who created and governs the universe, then is the
   source of the moral law none other than the living, the personal God.
   And if this be true of the natural law, it is still more indisputably
   true of the revealed law; for that is so thoroughly the expression of
   the will of a holy personal Being, that it must indeed either be
   received as such, or else rejected altogether.

   It follows, that what we have to do with in the order of human life,
   ethically considered, is not the law as such, but much rather, in the
   law and beyond the law, its holy Originator. [15] It is He who
   personally addresses to us the command, Be ye holy, for I am holy.
   Viewed in this light, the law attains a religious significance; it is
   no longer a mere order of life, but a link of life, the bond of union
   between man and God. And this gives a deep and wide significance to
   sin, because it thus appears not merely as disobedience against God,
   but as a severing of the bond which connects man with God, [16] and
   therefore as separation, departure, alienation from God, nay, as an
   antagonism to God, which at length rises to open enmity. [17] It is not
   till this is taken into consideration, that the essential
   characteristics of sin are fully manifest.

   The will of God concerning us, which finds expression in the law, is
   the will of holy love. In it God gives Himself to us, in order to make
   us holy and blessed in His fellowship. And the only fitting relation
   that man can occupy with reference to this holy, loving will of God, is
   that of absolute, trustful submission, and thankful love; and this
   state of mind is called faith. Where this, and the love that flows from
   it, are found, the law is fulfilled as a natural consequence. To faith
   and love, in their inseparable union, the law no longer imposes
   commands from without, the spirit of the law being by them implanted in
   the human will, as an all-governing principle. He in whom this has
   taken place has found the centre and nucleus of his life in God, and
   has therefore attained true liberty, perfect contentment, perfect
   blessedness.

   But if the only real fulfilling of the law proceeds from a personal
   self-surrender to God in faith and love, sin, the transgression of the
   law, must of necessity have its source in the opposite of this,--in the
   want of personal surrender to God, in the want of faith and of love; in
   a word, in man's having severed himself from his true and proper centre
   of life in God. Thus sin, in its inseparable connection with unbelief,
   [18] appears as a criminal violation of our relation to God, and as
   something requiring expiation,--something whose guilt must be done
   away, if this relation is to be restored.

   But when man has once severed himself from the true centre of his life,
   from God, he cannot stop at this point. His life must of necessity have
   some object, some aim and if he forsakes the centre appointed him, he
   must choose for himself a wrong one. This is the point at which the
   negative character of sin is naturally converted into something
   positively evil. The first thing to which the man who has forsaken God
   will turn, is the creature, the World, in the good things of which he
   deludes himself with the hope of finding satisfaction. But when he
   surrenders himself to the world, the impulse by which he is really
   possessed is the desire of making all things conduce to his own profit
   or advantage. It is self that he really seeks in everything,--even in
   those relations which have the appearance of love. [19]

   Thus the Ego becomes the real centre of life, and that self-love which
   in itself is natural and right--nay, which is the basis of the full
   development of the Divine likeness, of free personality in man--is
   perverted into the selfishness which is alike opposed to nature and to
   God. It is in this selfishness--in virtue of which a man can know no
   surrender to anything higher than himself, but subjects everything to
   his own particular ends, and at length shuts himself up either in dull
   indifference, or positive hatred and defiance--that we recognise both
   the essential nature of sin, and at the same time that distinctive
   feature whereby it becomes directly its own inevitable punishment. For
   if it be true that in faith and love towards God all goodness is
   implied, it is not less certain that, in that unbelieving selfishness
   which severs itself from God, all sin is included: selfishness is thus
   to be regarded as the radical sin, as the principle of all sin. And if
   true life and perfect peace can only flow forth to man from communion
   with God as the true centre of life, it follows, as a necessary
   consequence, that when man, emptying himself of such divine fulness,
   seeks only himself in everything, he must be consumed by unsatisfied
   longings, and at last find but death and hell. [20] It is in the full
   development of this perverted self-seeking, this conversion of the Ego
   into the central object, that sin reaches its climax. On the other
   hand, as constituting the original impulse of every development of sin,
   and the essence of sin in general, it may also be regarded as its
   commencement. In the latter case, however, it at first works more
   secretly, especially in the sensible forms of sin; and it is not till a
   subsequent period that it openly appears.

   The effects of sin correspond to its nature.

   The proper seat of sin is the will. But the spirit which manifests
   itself in the will is the very same spirit that is seen at work in the
   thoughts and feelings, in the imagination and the fancy; and this
   spirit becomes a living personality only by being united, by means of
   the soul, with a material body. Now, whatever makes the will go out in
   a wrong direction, whatever introduces into the region over which the
   will presides a power which interferes with the development of life,
   and produces desecrating or destructive effects, must produce like
   effects in the whole region of the spirit and the soul,--nay, through
   the soul those evil influences will extend even to the body; and thus
   the whole person will be affected by them. The moral blindness that has
   at all times been found to accompany sin,--the perversion, the
   contamination, the servitude of the will, which sin brings along with
   it, have, as their inevitable consequence, an increased perversion,
   likewise, of the moral judgment, an obscuration of knowledge,
   especially in things moral and divine, the pollution of the
   imagination, the unbridling Of the fancy, the degradation of the entire
   nature, the enfeebling of the whole soul, and the ruin of the organs
   and powers of the body.

   Man forms a unity, which is, however, only the foundation of that
   higher unity which is to be brought about in him, as a being made in
   the Divine image, by means of communion with God. Now sin does not
   merely obstruct this unity, but sets up in its place that which is its
   direct opposite. He who has fallen away from God by sin, does, as a
   necessary consequence, fall out both with himself and with all mankind.
   True unity in man is possible only when that which is godlike in
   him--that is, the mind--acquiesces in the divine order of life, and
   governs the whole being in conformity therewith. But when he has once
   severed himself from the true centre of his being, that is, from God,
   then also does that element of his being--his mind--which is akin to
   God, and which was intended to be the connecting and all-deciding
   centre of his personal life, lose its central and dominant position; he
   ceases to be lord of himself, and of his own nature; the various powers
   which make up his complex nature, begin to carry on, each for itself,
   an independent existence; the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the
   spirit wages a fruitless war with the flesh (Gal. v. 17); sinful desire
   becomes dominant, and while the man seems to be in the enjoyment of all
   imaginable liberty, he has lost the only true liberty, and has become a
   slave to himself; for whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin
   (John viii. 34;Rom. vi. 16-23). He is the dependent of self and being
   thus the slave of self, he is also the slave of pleasure, and of all
   those objects which it requires for its satisfaction. This falling out
   with himself is, moreover, ever accompanied by a rupture with his
   fellow-men. When his own personality is destroyed, he can no longer
   feel any true reverence for the personality of others where selfishness
   has taken root in the place of that love which is the bond of
   perfectness,' no fit and lasting relation with others is possible. He
   degrades others into means of subserving his own selfish ends, or,
   where this is impossible, into objects of dislike and envy.

   Hence no true fellowship, no fellowship worthy of human nature, can
   exist among those in whom sin prevails. The. wicked are never naturally
   social. The gregarious instinct, however, is indestructible in human
   nature and even those who are the servants of sin, mutually need each
   other's assistance in the pursuit of their various aims. Hence there
   arises among them, in the place of that moral fellowship, whose
   prototype is the kingdom of God, a spurious kind of fellowship, an
   external combination, which being, however, in reality founded only
   upon mutual spoliation, results in overreaching and violence. Such
   combination, on a large scale, begets a kingdom of evil; a kingdom,
   indeed, which cannot stand, because it hears within it the germ of
   discord and destruction, but which is yet so constituted, as to render
   it fearfully evident that sin is indeed a great and powerful fact.

   It is undeniable that sin is a phenomenon absolutely universal in human
   nature; and the saying of Holy Scripture, that the whole world lieth in
   wickedness, is indisputably confirmed both by history and individual
   experience. During the whole course of the natural development of
   mankind, history never brings before us a form of perfect purity, but
   shows us, on the contrary, that in spite of all the efforts exerted,
   and all the conflicts waged against it, evil is ever and anon breaking
   forth again with renewed energy. Antiquity, with all its glorious
   performances in the provinces of art and science, of legislation and
   national organization, ended in a tremendous moral dissolution. And
   ever since the appearance of Christianity in the world, sin has
   manifested itself to be a power which may indeed be broken, but which,
   unless it be broken by an arduous struggle, will be a dominant one. It
   has shown itself to be a power which maintains its position in the
   midst of all the boasted progress of mankind,--a power which, though in
   the course of human development it may indeed assume a more refined and
   polished form, remains unchanged in its essential attributes. Each
   man's own experience, moreover, convinces him of his personal share in
   that sin which thus pervades the whole race; and he who would acquit
   himself of participation therein, would but exhibit either the entire
   obtuseness of his moral sense, or a boundless self-delusion. Yet it is
   not the case--as each man's moral consciousness will testify--that sin
   first shows itself in individuals, in consequence of a fall from a
   previous state of peace, innocence, and goodness. On the contrary, each
   man, at the first awakening of the moral sense, finds himself tied and
   bound with the chain of sin; for he finds that to be present in him
   which constitutes the general foundation of sin. In other words, he is
   sensible of an opposition between the flesh and the spirit, of an
   inclination to act only from motives of self-love, and of an impulse to
   make self the central object. This sinful disposition is, more: over,
   deeply rooted, even in the case of those in whom the supremacy of sin
   is destroyed, and is no longer the dominant principle. Hence its after
   effects remain, and are ever and anon appearing in the form of
   incentives to evil, by means of seductive thoughts and inclinations.
   Hence, too, there is always a dark background to the heart; and so long
   as man is in the body, he never reaches a stage of progress at which
   the precept, Watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation,' loses one
   jot or tittle of its full importance. This absolute universality of sin
   evidently points to a cause common to all, to a tendency of nature
   contemporary with the birth of man,--for we are here treating of that
   which is anterior to the conscious activity of the will. The existence
   of such a sinful tendency in human nature is not taught only by the
   revelations of the Old and New Testament, but has been abundantly
   asserted, under every variety of expression, by the deepest and most
   earnest philosophers of all nations and ages. The origin of this sinful
   tendency it is beside our purpose to discuss. It will be sufficient for
   the present to have established the fact of its existence, that we may
   return hereafter to a more detailed treatment of the subject. We must
   not omit, however, to bring forward two points which bear upon the
   notion of sinlessness. First, If the supremacy of sin is so universal,
   and if its cause is a natural tendency in man as he is now born, this
   must entail upon the whole race, and upon each individual, a still
   deeper ruin, unless some power exists strong enough to overcome and
   find a remedy for such a state of things, and so constituted that a new
   and holy life may originate therefrom. And such a power will be found
   only in a person in whom sin is shown to be completely conquered. To
   this must be added, secondly, that this person must not only be
   perfectly free from actual sin during the whole course of his life, but
   that his inmost life, the basis of his whole development, must be
   thoroughly pure, and have no kind of sinful taint in it. And this leads
   us to a nearer consideration of the proper nature of sinlessness.

CHAPTER II.

  OF SINLESSNESS.

   IT is impossible to lay down à priori definitions concerning the
   actions and dispositions of sinless beings. It would be but a perverted
   manner of treating the subject, to insist upon a series of abstract
   requirements in all special cases, and then to measure an actual
   character by such a standard. The right way of proceeding is, on the
   contrary, to ascertain from an actual character, how sinless
   perfection, where it really existed, was manifested in the several
   features of the life. And yet it is both possible and necessary first
   to state, at least by a few fundamental definitions, what we conceive
   to be essential under all circumstances to the notion of sinlessness.
   Alter what has been already advanced, a short discussion will, however,
   suffice.

   The idea of sinlessness--anamartesia--does not in itself exclude the
   possibility of sinning. On the contrary, it is only where this
   possibility is in some manner presupposed, that sinlessness, properly
   so called, can be conceived. Absolute impeccability exists only in Him
   who is infinitely removed from evil, who never can be tempted with
   evil,--that is, in God. [21] But wherever there is human nature, and
   consequent liability to temptation, there is also, by reason of this
   very nature, the possibility of sin. In this case sinlessness consists
   in the fact that the basis from which the whole moral life is developed
   is a pure and energetic one; that in this development, moreover, no
   deviation from the divine order of life occurs, but that all which
   approaching from without would seduce to sin, is completely overcome by
   the victorious power within. He, then, of whom it may be said that by
   reason of his nature sin was possible to him, and yet by no special
   condition thereof necessary,--that he was, on the contrary, capable of
   abstaining from sin, and did actually continue to do so,--is a sinless
   being. [22]

   The meaning of the term sinlessness is, first of all, a negative one.
   But it is not applied in this sense to a single act of the will, or to
   the outward act. In such cases we employ the expressions
   irreproachability' or guiltlessness.' When, on the contrary, the far
   deeper term sinlessness is used, we always have in view the entire
   moral condition, and we contemplate this in its inmost nature. It is,
   however, also evident that here, too,--as in our definition of the
   nature of sin,--we cannot stop short at a mere negation. Sinlessness is
   indeed a notion which can be applied only to personal beings, called
   upon to will and to act as moral agents, and in whom, consequently, the
   very omission of such willing and acting is a violation of the divine
   order of life. This, in itself, requires the positive choice and
   practice of what is good. But this becomes still more decidedly the
   case, from the fact that sinlessness has to be maintained in a world
   that lieth in wickedness,--a world in which evil has become a ruling
   power. At the first commencement of the development of the human race,
   we might indeed conceive of sinlessness as a mere abstinence from
   sin,--as mere innocence not yet intermeddling with the opposition
   between good and evil. But after sin has entered and taken possession
   of human nature, the leading a sinless life becomes inconceivable apart
   from a most decided struggle against evil, even to its most hidden and
   deepest roots. And this fight for life and death,1 is no matter of mere
   childlike purity and innocence, but one demanding the most intense
   activity of the fully matured moral powers, and therefore something
   supremely positive,--the work accomplished by the moral personality; a
   work everywhere manifested by acts, and in which even endurance must
   become action.

   What this involves in the case of an individual, will be evident if we
   bear in mind those main features of the nature of sin already stated.
   We saw that sin was disobedience to the Divine order of life,--a
   disobedience at first internal, but afterwards appearing in external
   actions; that it was, moreover, a severance, through lack of faith and
   love, from the Divine Ruler of the world Himself; from God, the only
   true centre of life, and at the same time a setting up of the false one
   Self and the world; which, instead of the satisfaction sought therein,
   yields only discord, disorder, and ruin, whether to individuals, or to
   the whole sin-possessed community. In contrast to this, we should
   regard as sinless, one who should render obedience to the Divine law in
   the whole extent of its requirements,--an obedience not only maintained
   under all, even the most difficult, circumstances and conditions, but
   itself a fundamental fact of the character. Hence the moral life
   resulting from this obedience is no patched and piecemeal product, but
   a tissue woven of one material throughout,--an inseparable, undivided
   whole. Nor will this obedience be rendered merely to the law as such,
   but through this to its holy Author. The life will consequently be an
   uninterrupted acquiescence in the Divine will, a walking before God, a
   walking with God; and the whole constitution of the moral choice and
   action, together with personal surrender to God, faith, and vital
   piety, will form an indivisible, harmonious whole.

   Such a being is inconceivable, except as perfectly free, peaceful,
   happy, repelling all defilement and obscurity from the mental and
   corporeal life, and exercising, under all circumstances, a perfect
   self-control. From such a one, united by the band of perfect love to
   both God and man, might be reasonably expected the possession of an
   incalculable power, both to conquer sin in general in the human race,
   and, in spite of all the might and authority of evil, to call into
   existence a moral and religious community, in accordance with the
   Divine purpose towards the human race.

   It is in this its essentially positive as well as in its negative
   sense, that we apply the epithet sinless to the Lord Jesus. We view Him
   as the sinlessly Perfect, the absolutely Holy One, ever filled with the
   spirit of obedience, faith, and love, and so constantly and under all
   circumstances acting up to this spirit, that sin had no place in His
   life. It is self-evident that such a life could only have been
   developed from a pure basis: no original sinful tendency, no naturally
   evil inclination, is here conceivable, but only a fulness of moral
   power, perfect and inviolable even in its first rudiments. This,
   however, is not the point from which we start, but the conclusion at
   which we shall arrive in the course of . our discussion. Our
   starting-point is simply the historical manifestation of Jesus Christ,
   the actual facts presented by His human life; and our task is in the
   first instance to prove from these His sinless perfection.

   In the fulfilment of this task, however, we are conscious of the limits
   imposed upon us by the nature of the subject.

   Truths of the highest nature, especially those religious and moral
   truths which afford to our inner life its ultimate repose and inward
   satisfaction, are neither ascertained by the medium of the senses, nor
   are they susceptible of a demonstration which, like logical and
   mathematical axioms, possesses the quality of being utterly
   incontestable. The very nature of these truths places them beyond such
   means of proof, and this incapability is to be regarded, not as a
   defect, but as a mark of superiority. The region of moral and religious
   truth is a free one, and the supreme blessing which it offers can; only
   be appropriated by free and trusting acquiescence, i.e. by faith. Now
   faith--which, however decidedly it may be referred to a divine
   operation, must yet at the same time be ever regarded as a moral
   act--would forfeit its most essential nature if it were compelled by
   force of demonstration. All that can be shown is, that faith is the
   more reasonable and moral part, and that it answers to the requirements
   of human life infinitely more than its opposite.

   This, too, is the case with the sinlessness of Christ. As all moral
   greatness appearing in human form may be denied, or, where its
   manifestation cannot be contested, may at least have a doubt cast upon
   its inward motive, so also may the moral dignity and purity of Jesus.
   Doubt and opposition cannot even here be absolutely excluded or
   refuted, and, least of all, where there is an absence of all
   susceptibility for receiving impressions from purity and elevation of
   character, and of a capacity to appreciate them, unless manifested in a
   striking and brilliant manner. What is wanted is a willing and joyful
   confidence in Him who is exhibited to us as so exalted and so unique a
   Being,--an elevation of our own minds when approaching one so
   elevated,--a moral soaring towards that height which He occupies. Such
   a confidence, such an exaltation, may, however, be justified it can be
   shown that they are based upon the soundest external and internal
   evidence, and that their opposites would involve us in a maze of
   contradictions, and especially in such as are of a moral kind. [23]

   In this sense, then, we now proceed to prove, in its special reference
   to the person of Jesus Christ, the existence of that sinlessness of
   which we have hitherto spoken only according to its general features.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [21] Jas. 1. 13.

   [22] In applying to Christ the well-known formula, it is self-evident
   that sinlessness excludes the non potuit non peccare, since any kind of
   necessity to sin would make the remaining free therefrom à priori
   inconceivable. On the other hand, the fact of sinlessness directly
   involves not only the potuit non peccare, and the non peccavit,--the
   possibility of remaining free from sin, and the actual freedom
   therefrom,--but also demands, at least as the postulate of the whole
   moral development, the potuit peccare. Without this the temptation of
   Christ would be devoid of reality, and His example would lose an
   essential element of its importance. How far, however, when we take
   into account His office of Redeemer, and other circumstances, together
   with the potuit peccare--the possibility of sin, and the total
   abstinence therefrom--the non potuit peccare, and therefore a higher
   necessity of not sinning, might be predicated of Him, is a question
   which, as appertaining to the province of dogmatic theology or
   speculation, it is beside our purpose to discuss. Compare Steudel,
   Glaubenslehre, p. 241, and J. Müller, Lehre von der Sünde, ii. 225 and
   226.

   [23] Theologians, says even De Wette, must not, when bringing forward
   historical proofs, overlook the importance of faith, nor commit
   themselves to the vain effort of demonstrating, as evident, palpable
   truth, that which is to be apprehended by the faith which, though it
   does not see, yet seeing not, believes. Compare my article, Polemisches
   in Betreff der Sundlösigkeit Jesu,' Stud. und Kritik. 1842-3, p. 687,
   etc.

THE SINLESS HOLINESS OF CHRIST.
     __________________________________________________________________

   OUR purpose of treating in an apologetic point of view the sinlessness
   of Christ, leads us to consider this as manifested by the actual facts
   of His history. Hence our first task will be to establish these as
   historical facts in general are wont to be established,--on the one
   hand by credible testimony; on the other, by the undeniable effects
   resulting therefrom. With respect to the first point, we shall not
   confine ourselves to the testimony of others, but shall adduce that of
   Jesus Himself. For in this case we need for our full assurance the
   indissoluble concurrence of the two facts, that Jesus made upon others
   an inevitable impression that He was sinlessly perfect, and also that
   He was Himself both conscious of being absolutely free from sin, and
   ever ready unhesitatingly to affirm the same. With respect to the
   effects produced, moreover, all will depend upon our being able to
   exhibit such historical phenomena as can only be satisfactorily
   explained upon the supposition that the Lord Jesus was sinless; for it
   is evident, on the one hand, that if one perfectly pure and free from
   all sin did actually appear in the midst of an otherwise universally
   sinful race, so unique an occurrence could not fail to produce effects
   of an utterly peculiar, nay, of a unique kind; and, on the other, that
   if such historical phenomena actually exist, we are justified in
   inferring the reality of the cause from that of the effects.

   These, then, are the chief points which we have to discuss in the
   following chapters. We start from the evidence, and draw inferences by
   referring to effects. With respect to evidence, moreover, we
   distinguish not merely between the testimony of others and the
   self-testimony of Christ, but also, as far as the former is concerned,
   between expressions of a general kind and that portraiture of the Lord
   Jesus, exhibiting as it does the minutest details of His character,
   delivered to us by the circle most intimately connected with Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER I.

  TESTIMONY TO THE SINLESSNESS OF CHRIST.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sec. 1.--By Others.

   WHEN we cast a searching glance at the actual events of our Lord's
   life, we cannot help wishing that men of the most opposite ranks and
   dispositions, occupying positions exterior to Christianity, sceptical,
   or even inimical, had left us express accounts of the impressions
   produced by His actions and character. Such a wish is, however, but
   scantily gratified by history. We know, indeed, with unquestionable
   certainty, from the testimony of heathen authors, that Jesus suffered
   death by crucifixion in the reign of Tiberius, [24] and that even from
   the very first, divine honours were paid Him by those who were called
   Christians after Him, as the Christ. [25] We have also the passage of
   the Jewish author Josephus in which, so far as it is genuine, Jesus is
   spoken of in generally favourable terms. [26] And, lastly, we perceive
   from the various statements of non-Christian authors, that the first
   importance was from the earliest period attributed to the person of
   Jesus Christ with respect to the establishment of Christianity. [27]
   But as far as anything individual or characteristic concerning His
   person is concerned, we learn absolutely nothing from such sources.
   Hence we are thrown entirely upon the information furnished us by those
   who adhered to Him in faith and devoted love,--that is, by the
   apostles. This information has not, however, been handed down to us in
   such wise as to give forth, so to speak, only a monotone of approbation
   and admiration of the moral elevation of Christ. On the contrary, we
   are thereby presented with a copious, varied, and unique portraiture of
   the impression He produced. The apostles do indeed also sum up in
   statements of a doctrinal kind their views of His moral character but
   these, bearing as they do the impress not of a standing formula, but of
   a free expression of conviction, are at the same time accompanied by
   the Gospel narrative. In this we possess a delineation carried out in a
   series of most varied pictures, both of the manner in which men of the
   most opposite dispositions--men indifferent and enthusiastic, devoted
   and inimical--were affected by the moral conduct manifested by Jesus
   Christ, and also of this conduct itself in all those conditions and
   relations of life by which character in general is tested.

   We proceed to consider this more closely, and will first review some
   features and expressions of a more general kind. It is one leading mark
   of a strong and sharply defined character, to call forth a decided, and
   even an inimical reaction. And such was the effect produced in the case
   of Jesus Christ. By a behaviour utterly free from respect of persons,
   He stirred up irreconcilable enmity. But the vigilant hatred of His
   foes, though everywhere following His steps, found nothing by which
   they might impugn the purity of His conduct. On the other hand, even
   those who observed Him in other respects with indifference, were struck
   and captivated by the peculiar dignity of His character. His
   worldly-minded judge,--a man by no means very susceptible of what was
   noble and exalted, nay, even a hard and cruel man,--felt himself
   compelled to bear solemn testimony to the innocence of the persecuted
   Jesus. [28] The wife of Pilate, too, who, though undoubtedly of a
   gentler character, would naturally have but little interest in the fate
   of a Jewish teacher, was yet so possessed by the certainty of His
   blameless purity, that the thought that her husband might be stained
   with the blood of that just Person, left her no rest even in sleep.
   [29] The commander of the Roman guard, at the cross, was so overcome by
   the impression made by the sufferer, that he gave a testimony to the
   righteousness of Jesus, which displays a reverence far surpassing any
   ordinary human standard. [30] And even the thief who was crucified with
   Him was moved by the aspect of the sufferer,--who in this moment of
   deepest desertion seemed devoid of aught calculated to awaken
   faith,--to the most entire reliance upon His person, and thereby to a
   joyful hope of a better life. [31]

   Nowhere did the conduct of Jesus leave its beholders
   indifferent,--nowhere did it fail to produce a powerful impression. His
   Person produced upon all with whom He came in contact, the effect of
   compelling a moral decision; and during the whole course of His life,
   His mere presence passed a silent but irresistible sentence upon those
   by whom He was surrounded. This was most powerfully manifested in the
   case of those who were most intimately connected with Him; and from
   this circle we will adduce here only two specially striking
   examples,--viz. the betrayer of Jesus, and that apostle upon whom, as
   upon one firm as a rock to confess Him, Jesus built His Church. Even
   Judas Iscariot is a witness to the purity and innocence of Christ, and
   that by an act of the most decided kind,--an act not indeed of faith
   and love, but of despair. Like the other apostles, he too had, during
   three years of intimate intercourse, every opportunity of most closely
   observing the conduct of the Lord Jesus; and if he had detected any
   flaw in it, he would most certainly have brought this forward, after
   his treachery was consummated, for the purpose of palliating his deed
   and quieting his conscience. But finding nothing, he was constrained to
   confess that he had betrayed the innocent blood; [32] and the
   conviction of this crime was so heavy a burden on his soul, that he
   went away and killed himself. Thus even in and through the traitor, was
   the moral dignity and power of Jesus manifested; not, however, as a
   light unto life, but as a judgment unto death.

   A contrast to this picture is exhibited in the case of St. Peter. The
   same apostle who first made a confession of faith in Jesus as the Son
   of the living God, makes an equally remarkable, though more indirectly
   expressed, confession of the moral glory of his Master. We allude, in
   the first place, to the expressions which broke from his lips after the
   miraculous draught of fishes: Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O
   Lord.' [33] Undoubtedly the immediate occasion of these words was that
   manifestation of the power of Christ which he had just beheld; but it
   is worthy of remark, that Peter does not in the view of it exclaim, I
   am a weak, a perishing,' but I am a sinful man.' Hence is very evident
   that Peter recognised in Him who had just shown forth such mighty
   power, pre-eminently One who would be polluted by intercourse with him
   the sinner, and hence one separate from sinners, the Holy One. The
   sinner and the Holy One of God can, so it seems to him, have nothing in
   common. We have in this saying the direct utterance of a soul struck
   with the moral dignity and uniqueness of Christ,--an utterance as
   strong and definite as can well be imagined, and at the same time an
   evidence of the light in which the apostle regarded our Lord's
   miraculous power, viz. as based upon moral reasons, and inseparable
   from sinless perfection. [34] It shows how intimately connected in his
   view were the morally and the physically miraculous. With this trait is
   connected a similar one in the life of St. Peter. We mean the
   circumstance that, after his denial of his Master, it needed only a
   look from the latter [35] to produce the deepest conviction of sin, and
   the bitterest remorse in fhe heart of the apostle. A mere look could
   never have had such power, unless the sacred purity and dignity of Him
   whom he had first denied, had at the same time been irresistibly
   present to his mind. The holy purity of Jesus and his own sinfulness
   are, to the apostle's mind, like two opposite poles, which exercise a
   power of mutual limitation in the effect they produce upon his inward
   emotions.

   The same truth which is in these instances brought before us by facts,
   is still more definitely and expressly asserted by the apostles in many
   doctrinal passages; and this is done in a manner which makes it obvious
   that they are by no means speaking of a moral excellence which might be
   shared also by others, but of a perfection attributable to the Lord
   Jesus alone. Neither is this all-surpassing elevation indefinitely and
   indirectly hinted at, but insisted on in a manner at once most decided
   and direct. All the apostles and apostolic men, and foremost among them
   he whose actions we have just mentioned as making a like confession,
   and St. John, the beloved disciple, recognised in Christ not merely a
   righteous and innocent man, but the Righteous and Holy One in a
   super-eminent way, in an absolutely unique sense. [36] He is in their
   eyes One who was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin;
   [37] who is our perfect example, because He did no sin, neither was
   guile found in His mouth; [38] the Lamb without blemish and without
   spot; [39] the true High Priest, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate
   from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; [40] who therefore
   needed not, as other high priests, to offer up sacrifice for His own
   sins; who, since in Him there was no sin, was for that very reason all
   the more able to take away ours. [41] But for this persuasion,
   moreover, of the sinless holiness of Jesus, the apostles could by no
   means have recognised in Him, as they actually did, not merely the
   greatest of all the prophets, but the Messiah, endowed with the fulness
   of the Divine Spirit, [42] the founder of the kingdom of God, of which
   He was Himself to be both King and Lawgiver, the Redeemer from sin, the
   likeness of the alone good and holy God. For it is evident that none
   but One, the persuasion of whose holy purity had penetrated their
   inmost hearts, could have been all this, and especially the perfect
   Redeemer from sin. The traits and expressions hitherto adduced, and
   especially the latter, are, however, all of a general kind, and
   destitute of individuality. Hence it might be possible to regard them
   as the results of doctrinal prepossessions, and to declare that those
   who believed in Jesus, being persuaded that He was the Messiah and
   Redeemer, could not fail to attribute to Him the qualities which this
   character required, and among these was undoubtedly that of sinless
   perfection. Such a view, indeed, leaves unexplained the fact how faith
   in Jesus as the Messiah and Redeemer could exist at all, unless He
   really did produce the impression of a personality entirely pure and
   sinless. Sinlessness, too, as we shall hereafter see, was by no means
   so current a notion, that it had but to be applied to some person or
   other. On the contrary, it was not till the actual appearance of Jesus
   that it distinctly presented itself to the consciousness; and this
   being the case, it is but reasonable to infer that its source was this
   very appearance. It is, moreover, specially worthy of consideration,
   that the account presented to us of the person of Jesus by His apostles
   by no means consists of mere general statements, but also places before
   us a copious and detailed history of His life and character. By this,
   these more general features and expressions receive concrete completion
   and living confirmation. And the more so, because the evangelists have
   handed down to us their portraiture of Christ in a manner which
   exhibits no trace of forethought or design, but gives abundant
   indication of that artless simplicity which draws only the actual
   features,--features, however, which naturally combine to form a
   perfectly harmonious and utterly unique whole.

   The task, then, which we have now to perform, is to gather together
   into a whole the various features of the portrait of the Lord Jesus, as
   furnished by the Gospels. This is a subject which, as all must allow,
   can never be exhaustively treated,--a task whose accomplishment can at
   best be but approximated. It is a theme infinite in its nature, and
   ever offering new aspects, at various ages of the world, and in
   successive stages of human development. As such it inevitably meets us
   in the course of our argument; and we consequently attempt its
   treatment, though we do so with the fullest conviction of our own
   insufficiency.

  THE GOSPEL PORTRAITURE OF JESUS.

   All must agree that the impression produced by the Gospel delineation
   of the Lord Jesus is one of moral greatness,--a greatness which has
   frequently overcome even the opponents of positive Christianity. It is,
   however, a greatness utterly new in kind. It is not said of Jesus that
   He was great in the eyes of the world, but great in the sight of the
   Lord.' [43] In heathen antiquity those were regarded as great men who,
   striving to excel their fellows, raised themselves above their
   contemporaries, either by mighty deeds, or by brilliant achievements in
   the realms of art or science. [44] This greatness, moreover, ever
   consisted in the fact, that in them the genius of their nation, working
   in a definite sphere, and with concentrated energy, became, as it were,
   incorporate. Within the province of the Old Testament it was indeed
   otherwise inasmuch as here it was no longer from mere self-reliant
   human strength that greatness was derived, but from the direct
   influence of Divine power. Yet even here greatness consisted
   essentially in those mighty manifestations of the Spirit which,
   surpassing what was common to man, were displayed in extraordinary and
   imposing actions, and here, too, all was effected within the closely
   drawn boundaries of nationality.

   Quite otherwise was it with the Lord Jesus. His path was not upwards,
   but downwards. He was great, not by ascending, but by condescending:
   hence His was not a brilliant, but a silent greatness. The aim of His
   every action was to draw near to the mean and despised, to seek the
   lost, to minister to others, instead of being ministered to. His
   dignity was veiled under the form of a servant and as He ever avoided
   worldly honour, [45] and never sought His own glory, so did He chiefly
   manifest the strength of His will, in having no will of His own, but
   committing all things to God. His soul was silent before God (Ps.
   lxxii. 1, marg.), and His whole walk--especially when He silently
   suffered the worst to befall Him--was one uninterrupted expression of
   perfect acquiescence in the Divine counsels.

   This is not a greatness which directly strikes the eye, and makes a
   powerful external impression, but a greatness of the inner nature.
   Jesus was great in the inner man before He had done anything externally
   great. And even when He did perform deeds with which nothing else could
   be compared, the reason of their super-eminence lay chiefly in the fact
   that they were done by Him, by One so unique in His inner nature. His
   disciples might--as He Himself said [46] --do such works as He did, and
   even greater; but these works could never be of like significance with
   His, because in Him the personality whence all originated was of a
   nature so far more exalted.

   But this personality found the roots of its being and the object of its
   existence, not in anything special and limited like national genius,
   not in any single province of human activity, but in that which
   concerns all men without exception,--in the manifestation of the true
   relation to God, and the true relation to man. The whole life of Jesus
   was spent in realizing this relation in Himself, and from Himself
   towards all mankind, as at once the Son of God and the Son of man.
   Hence His was no special calling, but the calling of callings, the
   perfect fulfilment of which was to impart to all individual vocations a
   sure and eternal foundation. [47] Hence, too, His greatness is not such
   as is achieved in any special province; it is not the greatness of the
   hero or the lawgiver, of the profound thinker or the artist, but one
   which far transcends all these,--that greatness in which is manifested
   the true and universal Human in its highest relation, its relation to
   God, and through Him to all mankind; that greatness for which none
   other can furnish a standard, before which every other which does not
   unduly exalt itself must be constrained to bow.

   It is not enough, however, thus to allude to the greatness of Christ in
   general outlines,--we must also descend to particulars. Yet we would
   guard against doing this in such wise as to seem, by presenting a
   collection of specially striking traits, to catalogue the chief and
   special virtues of the Lord. Jesus did not, in fact, manifest this or
   that particular virtue; but, according to the very significant
   expression of St. John, He manifested the life. It is His entire life
   which must be the subject of our contemplation, though, if our view of
   it is to be a vivid one, details must certainly not be excluded.

   The very first thing which strikes us in the Gospel portraiture of
   Jesus, is the harmony which pervaded His whole life, the peace which
   flowed around Him, and which He ever communicated to those about Him.
   The impression made upon us by His appearance is ever one of repose,
   self-possession, and self-reliance, combined with deep inexhaustible
   mental emotion: He was distinguished, neither by the lofty ecstasy of
   an Isaiah or an Ezekiel, nor by the legislative and mighty energy of a
   Moses; His nature, on the contrary, was all serenity and gentleness.
   The sacred flame which glowed in the ancient prophets was in Him
   transformed into the soft but ever-energizing presence of the creative
   breath of the Spirit. As it was not the storm which rent the mountains,
   nor the fear-inspiring earthquake, nor the devouring fire, but the
   still small voice,' which announced to Elijah the presence of the Lord,
   so was it also with the Lord Jesus. [48] He dwelt without intermission
   on those heights to which specially favoured individuals have, in
   isolated moments, been enabled to approximate. Like the sun in a
   cloudless sky, He quietly pursued with undeviating constancy Hi&
   appointed path. His words were full of light, and His works of heart
   and warmth, and yet they were ever free from violent emotion or
   passion. He did nothing thoughtlessly or without a purpose; whatever He
   undertook was ever crowned with complete success, and never failed to
   attain its object. Even when rebuking with severity, nay, denouncing
   with anger, it was not personal irritation that moved Him, but the holy
   wrath of love,--a love which hated sin, while it loved in the sinner
   the man capable of being redeemed. In such cases, as in all others,
   even in the most trying circumstances of His life, He ever maintained
   uniform self-possession and perfect self-control. Thus possessed of
   inward peace, He was able to address to His disciples the glorious
   words, Peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you.'

   The harmony and peace which prevailed in the character of Jesus did
   riot arise, however, from such a toning down of the various powers and
   activities as would prevent any of them from attaining its full energy
   of action. A harmony so attained would be not the harmony of greatness,
   but of mediocrity. The harmony of greatness can exist only in a strong
   character, where a rich, deep, powerfully stirred life wells up, and
   where discordant qualities are brought into unison. And this was
   eminently the case with Jesus,--with Him who came to send a sword as
   well as to send peace, and is with equal right entitled the Lion of the
   tribe of Judah, and the Lamb that taketh away the sin of the world. The
   harmony manifested in His character is based upon the richest fulness
   of heart and spirit, and proves itself to be the harmony of true
   greatness, by the fact that the tendencies which in other cases
   mutually exclude each other,--the powers and activities which are
   elsewhere found apart,--here work side by side in their full energy,
   and are blended by supreme power of mind into one glorious whole. In
   Him the Individual and the universally Human, independence and
   submission, doing and enduring, sublime majesty and humble
   condescension, are united, and pervade one another in a manner entirely
   new, and not even approximated by any who preceded Him. They are so
   combined that we cannot omit one of them, if we would have His portrait
   unimpaired and undiminished.

   Let us first contemplate the relation of the Individual to the
   universally Human in the person of Jesus. As a man, Jesus was placed
   under all the laws of human existence. He lived under the conditions of
   race and family; He had certain endowments of mind, and a certain
   mental disposition; He belonged to a certain nation, and lived at a
   certain historical era He entered into all these special relations, and
   did justice to them all. But instead of being limited by them, they
   served Him as means of realizing and manifesting that which was truly
   human in and beyond them.

   The invincible will which He ever maintained was such, that we must
   call the Lord Jesus a man in the fullest sense of the word; yet we must
   not, on this account, make His peculiar characteristic to consist in
   manliness in so far as this is opposed to womanliness, for He equally
   manifested all the gentleness, purity, and tenderness of the female
   character. We find in Him high intellectual endowments; but it would be
   an error to characterize Him as pre-eminently acute or profound, clever
   or imaginative, because not any one of these gifts, though they were
   all seen in rich abundance, was the predominant quality of His mind.
   Nor less do we perceive in Him varying frames of mind and changes of
   disposition,--cheerfulness and freedom from anxiety, as well as deep
   seriousness and depression; quick susceptibility and imperturbable
   equanimity; painful fear and joyful resignation. And yet we could not
   but consider it unseemly to attribute to Him a peculiar temperament, in
   the ordinary acceptation of the term; for all that we know of Him
   produces the impression of a thoroughly sound and healthy mingling of
   dispositions, and a constantly natural interchange of emotions. [49]

   But this interpenetration of the particular and the general,--this
   repletion of a given individual form with the higher and universal
   spirit of humanity,--is super-eminently shown in the position which
   Jesus occupied with regard to His family and nation. He fulfilled all
   His duties as a member of a family, and especially manifested, even to
   His dying hour, the tenderest filial affection. But at the same time He
   subordinated all that occurred in the family circle to the Divine
   purposes, and made individual interests yield to those which were
   higher and universal. [50] As the founder of the kingdom of God upon
   earth, He regarded every one who did the will of God as His mother, and
   sister, and brother. In this sense, too, He required that every member
   of that kingdom should be willing to sever even the closest family
   ties, if they should form an obstacle in the way of his following his
   only Lord and Master. In like manner, Jesus did not cease to be a
   member of His nation. He performed with conscientious faithfulness all
   the Divine appointments which had been prescribed to His people, and
   submitted Himself even to human customs when praiseworthy and right. In
   His labours He observed the requirements and the forms of the spirit of
   His people, and adapted Himself most cordially and entirely to the
   circumstances of time and place. But while He did this, there was in
   His demeanour not a shade of those peculiarities which
   disadvantageously distinguish His peculiar nationality. He rather
   raised it above its narrowness, and happily exhibited in Himself such
   of its characteristics as were to be of decided importance to the
   religious development of the whole human race.

   This is one of the principal characteristics by which Jesus is
   distinguished from all the great spirits of antiquity, even the
   greatest of them. However profound in thought those men may have been,
   however comprehensive in action, they still bear, all of them, the
   impress of their own peculiar nationality, they still mirror back the
   age in which they lived; and this is true, not only of their life in
   its outward form, but also of their inmost and deepest nature. Even a
   Socrates knew no higher virtue than a free obedience to the law of his
   country, and a faithful observance of the customs of the fathers. Their
   noblest enthusiasm was evoked by the interests of their fatherland, and
   the highest deed they could achieve was to die for it. They grew out of
   the spirit of their age and nation: hence their reaction on their age
   and nation consisted, for the most part, in manifesting the fullest and
   noblest expression of that spirit. [51]

   Jesus Christ was surpassed by no sage or hero of any era, either in
   power of action, or in readiness for self-sacrifice. But the principle
   which determined and guided His whole life was not national, but human;
   not temporal, but eternal. His moral character did not bear the impress
   of the age to which He belonged, but had the ring of eternity' about
   it. Developed from His own inner nature, He was the first to present an
   example of a full and perfect man, and, though connected with a
   particular nation, yet, by breaking through and abolishing national
   restrictions, to realize the idea of a common humanity. [52] Hence,
   too, He was the first who, though His labours in their actual order
   began among His own people, did not confine Himself to their limits,
   but embraced in holy love the whole human race, and for it dared to
   live and die. It was thus that He became the portrayer of humanity as a
   living whole,--as a single body, through which divine energies flowed,
   the founder of the kingdom of God. And this He could only be, on the
   one hand, by lovingly recognising the infinite worth of each individual
   soul, and submitting Himself to all the divinely appointed distinctions
   in human life and, on the other, by rising above everything particular,
   whether in the individual or the family, the race or the nation by
   embracing in mind and heart all mankind, and transfiguring, by the new
   principle which He introduced, that which was special into that which
   was genuinely human and universally true. Hence it is the universal
   nature of its morality which specially strikes us in the character of
   the Lord. Yet this is never a vague generality, a colourless
   abstraction, but a morality in all respects so replete with rich,
   vivid, and quite unusual characteristics, that we cannot fail to
   attribute to Him also the trait of strong and well-defined
   individuality. [53]

   But not only are the individual and the universal resolved into one
   beauteous whole in the person of Christ, but other opposing
   characteristics of human life--self-dependence and resignation, action
   and suffering--mingle in Him in perfect harmony. It is true, indeed,
   that in every human development which is not, morally speaking,
   abnormal, we shall find both self-dependence and submission, power to
   do and to suffer. In every case, however, it will be manifest that one
   or the other has the preponderance,--that the man distinguished for
   self-dependence and energy is not equally great in resignation and
   endurance; or, on the other hand, that he who is in an eminent degree
   resigned and enduring, is deficient in action and self-reliance. In the
   person of Jesus these opposites were perfectly reconciled. His
   self-reliance was maintained in conjunction with absolute resignation,
   and His resignation was based upon the truest self-reliance. His
   actions, which ever betrayed a trace of suffering, disclosed at the
   same time a sublime spirit of endurance; and His sufferings, which were
   entirely voluntary, manifested at the same time the most untiring
   energy. Jesus was completely self-reliant, absolutely free and
   self-possessed. It is true that even He who had not where to lay His
   head, required, in His outward life, the assistance of others; while,
   for His inner life, He stood in need of the love of His own. He drew
   John nearer to His heart than the rest; He rejoiced in the submission
   of the woman that was a sinner; He desired heartily' to eat the
   passover with His disciples; He wanted them to be near Him, and to
   sympathize and watch with Him in the last agony of His soul. But this
   purely human need of sympathy never became in Him dependence upon
   others. He ever found firmness within Himself, and was ever determined
   in His outward procedure by inward motives. He could say to the
   apostles, Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. Ye call me
   Master and Lord; and ye say well, for so I am.' Nor did He merely say
   this,--He ever acted upon it; for always, in relation to everything
   that was highest, He appeared not in the character of a receiver, but a
   giver,--not as one strengthened by others, but as one who imparted both
   strength and liberty. In His heaviest and most decisive trials, He
   relied upon Himself alone; and it was in Gethsemane, where the
   disciples slept,--on the cross, when they forsook Him, that the
   independence and dignity of the Shepherd, who remained unmoved when His
   flock was scattered, were first fully revealed. In order to attain to
   the dominion which He exercised, He did not, like others, require to
   make use of means external to Himself: on the contrary, every agency by
   which He worked was within Himself; and in this sense may the words of
   the prophet be applied to Him: The government is upon His shoulders.'
   [54] But in this self-reliance in which Jesus, as altogether free from
   sin, and altogether holy, stood opposed to, the world, whose sin He
   deeply recognised, He never showed Himself exclusive and unsympathizing
   towards the sinful and the guilty. On the contrary, it was just as one
   wholly self-dependent that He gave Himself without reserve to the
   world; and it was as He who had life in Himself, that He lived not for
   Himself, but for others. Nothing that was human was foreign to Him. He
   wept over Jerusalem; He was grieved for the people; He called to Him
   the weary and heavy-laden; He preached the gospel to the poor. His
   practice was to restore the broken reed, and to revive the smoking
   flax. His whole life, even till His death upon the cross, stands before
   us as one great act of self-sacrifice. Self-reliance and resignation
   both appear in Him in their truly, ethical character: the former as the
   self-reliance of unbounded benevolence, which lives only for others;
   the latter, as the resignation of an entirely self-reliant, yet at the
   same time self-abnegating nature. He was capable of entire
   self-surrender, because of His perfect self-possession; and He was thus
   perfectly self-possessed, because fulness of self-sacrificing love was
   His very nature.

   Similar to this is the relation between doing and suffering in the life
   of Christ. Jesus appears, at first sight, to have been essentially a
   man of action. He was wont, indeed, to withdraw into retirement, for
   the purposes of recollection and prayer; yet activity, and not
   contemplation, was the prevailing feature of His life. He went about
   doing good. He was constantly employed in ministering to the temporal
   as well as the spiritual wants of men. His very words were deeds, and
   His whole life a work' which the Father had given Him to do, and from
   which He never rested while it was day.' In accomplishing this work, He
   invariably kept one end in view, and manifested, in every circumstance
   of life, that power of mind which seems peculiar to those who are
   called to decided action. At the same time, however, He whose life
   seemed thus dedicated to action, was also super-eminently a sufferer.
   He was indeed the man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.' [55] He
   was constantly enduring want and temptation, enmity and indignity.
   Besides those severe outward sufferings which awaited Him, even till
   the martyrdom of the cross, He incessantly felt the deepest mental
   affliction, because all the opposition and enmity which He encountered,
   arose from the sin of those whose salvation He regarded as His special
   office. And He bore all this, not with stoical indifference, but with
   deep and tender human sensibility, without murmuring or bitterness,
   committing all to God in quiet confidence, and never ceasing, even in
   the midst of His bitterest sufferings, to love those by whom they were
   inflicted. Doing and suffering were perfectly blended together in His
   life; and it is impossible at any juncture to separate the actions of
   the Lord Jesus from His sufferings, or to think of His sufferings apart
   from the activities of His existence. The acts of Christ were ever
   attended by suffering. [56] His very entrance upon His divinely
   appointed work was caused by sympathy for sinful men; how much more,
   then, must its accomplishment have entailed continual suffering, as
   being an unintermitting conflict with sin, which was the original cause
   of all the sorrows of His soul! At the same time, every suffering of
   Christ was also an act, for He did not merely allow suffering to come
   upon Him as something from without, but consciously entered into it,
   and voluntarily took it upon Himself, as a matter of Divine
   appointment. On this account, His death and passion must be regarded as
   the noblest action of His life. He endured the cross, though He might
   have had pleasure. [57] Thus did He manifest, in equal force and
   inseparable combination, the spirit both of the hero and the sufferer,
   and place before our eyes a harmony nowhere else to be found in the
   wide pages of history; because none but He ever waged such utter war
   with sin, or carried on this contest after so Divine a fashion.

   Again, such a life could not fail to bear the fullest impress both of
   humilityy and majesty,--a majestic humility, and a majesty of a humble
   nature. Rightly, indeed, could Jesus say of Himself, I am meek and
   lowly of heart.' His whole life was one continuous act of
   self-sacrifice, and one uninterrupted course of self-abasement. Even at
   its close, when He knew that He was about to depart to the Father, He
   gave the most touching example of that condescending love which
   ministers to others, by washing His disciples' feet; [58] thus bearing
   testimony that He regarded the service of love as the perfection of
   life. And yet a kingly spirit was ever shining forth through the veil
   of humiliation and reproach with which He was covered; and His words as
   well as His actions expressed a consciousness which we must either not
   understand at all, or understand as the result of inward dignity of an
   utterly incomparable nature. Many were the words of majesty which fell
   from the mouth of Jesus,--from His first utterance in the synagogue of
   Nazareth, To-day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears,' [59] to
   that powerful testimony before His worldly-minded judge, I am a King.
   To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that
   I should bear witness unto the truth!' [60] What an effect, too, did
   the majesty of His personal appearance produce on all! It struck with
   the same power, though in such different manners, both the officers who
   were sent to apprehend Him, [61] and the disciple who had denied Him;
   [62] both the excited accusers who were ready to stone Him, [63] and
   the contrite malefactor who recognised in Him a Saviour, even amidst
   the horrors of crucifixion. And here, as before, these opposite
   attributes qualify each other. The Lord Jesus was thus full of majesty,
   just because His high soul bowed in such deep humility before God;; and
   thus perfectly humble, because His was not the humility of the sinner,
   arising from a deep sense of unworthiness before God, but that of one
   who had the high consciousness of full communion with God.

   Thus is the portrait of our Lord presented to us as full of dignified
   majesty and holy gentleness; and that in traits so clearly defined,
   that they cannot fail to strike even the dullest mind. Nowhere do we
   find aught of show or ostentation,--nowhere a trace of labouring for
   effect or of imitation: all is truth and simplicity; every act is the
   product of His inmost soul, and yet every act is sustained by a repose
   and self-consciousness, whose marvellous composure is never for a
   moment disturbed. Everywhere is seen the perfect harmony of a strong
   and noble character,--or, to speak more correctly, of this One
   character,--which in this its perfectly harmonious blending, both of
   deepest feeling, and rich, full manifestation, is utterly beyond
   comparison. What, then, was the source of this harmony? It surely lay
   in the fact that all the actions of the Lord Jesus proceeded from one
   creative force, that His whole life was regulated by one governing
   principle. It is to this prin. ciple, this force, that we must now
   direct our attention.

   And, first of all, the governing principle of the Lord's life was the
   maxim, To do the will of God. [64] This will, knowing it as He did,
   directly and infallibly, was the only rule of His life. He did what the
   Father gave Him to do,--what He saw the Father do. [65] To do this was
   His meat and drink. [66] Without this entire subjection to God, He
   could not have lived,--could not have been satisfied for a single
   moment. Hence His life was the manifestation of a perfect
   obedience,--an obedience not merely to Divine law, but to God
   Himself,--an obedience consisting not merely of a series of individual
   acts, but forming the one act of His whole life. And this obedience He
   learned especially by the things which He suffered; [67] being thus
   made perfect, that He might become to others a source of obedience unto
   salvation. [68] But this obedience itself arose from a still deeper
   source, from the full unreserved surrender of His inmost soul to God,
   that is, from His faith, which, in its very nature, is one with love.
   Jesus dwelt entirely in the faith and love of God: these were the roots
   of His character, the sources of His life; from these He drew, not to
   possess them for Himself, but to impart them to others. From His love
   to God there ever flowed an inexhaustible stream of love to man; and it
   was this, its source, which gave to the human love of Jesus a character
   so peculiar and so different from anything that had yet been seen. It
   was not merely a hearty benevolence, and a general readiness to afford
   assistance, but a love full of a holy seriousness of purpose, and
   wholly directed towards one end,--to effect the salvation of all who
   needed it, i.e. of the whole sinful and sin-ruined race of man. Hence
   it was, by its own inner nature, a love which condescended to those of
   low degree, which sought out the lost and the reprobate, that it might
   first make them fitting objects of love; and thus, too, it was a
   compassionate, a preventing, a love-creating love. It is this which is
   the fundamental principle of the holy love of God Himself; [69] and
   since the whole life of the Lord Jesus, till His voluntary
   self-sacrifice, was passed in the active manifestation of this love, we
   have in Him, and in His love, not a mere reflex, but an actual and
   genuine manifestation of Divine love.

   Finally, it is in this love that we find that unifying power, in virtue
   of which, varied and seemingly opposite qualities are blended into one
   harmonious whole in the character of Jesus. This love it was which,
   entering into all the divinely ordained distinctions of human life, at
   the same time rose above them to embrace the whole human race; which
   blissfully resting in God, nevertheless impelled to ceaseless activity
   for man which, free and independent in its own nature, gave itself to
   be a ministering servant to all which imparted strength both to do and
   to endure, and was as majestic in its holy earnestness as it was lowly
   in its condescension. It was this which set upon every act of the Lord
   Jesus the ineffaceable mark of religion, and which elevated what we
   should else call morality into holiness. Hence it is, that while the
   piety of Jesus never obtrudes itself as a special, and, as it were, an
   independent quality, every act becomes in His case one of religion, of
   worship; [70] and hence, too, His whole manifestation does not give an
   impression of mere religion or mere morality, but of religion and
   morality in perfect combination,--in a word, of holiness. According,
   then, to what has been said, we see in the Lord Jesus a character in
   perfect unison with itself,--equally great in acting as in suffering.
   In Him we behold a Being whose one object was the salvation of sinners,
   and whose life and death were acts of absolute self-surrender for the
   sake of accomplishing that object; One whose essential nature was
   perfect, i.e. Divine, love manifested in a purely human form.

   In such a Being, sin--i.e. antagonism to God--could have no place,
   because selfishness, which is the principle of sin, was utterly
   abolished by the all-conquering energy of love to God and man. And, in
   fact, we find the picture of the Lord Jesus which the Gospels furnish,
   and which all the apostles received, to be such, that even if nothing
   had been expressly stated on this point, we could never have conceived
   of sin--of alienation from God--as a feature thereof, without being
   immediately sensible that we were thus essentially disfiguring, nay,
   altogether destroying it.

   But, it may be asked, is not all this but fiction? If it were, we could
   not but say, with the noble-minded Claudius, [71] that one might well
   let himself be branded, or broken on the wheel, for the very idea,--and
   he who could laugh or mock must certainly be mad.' The portrait of the
   Lord Jesus, as presented in the Gospels, even if regarded as a mere
   idea or fiction, is the sublimest and most glorious idea to which the
   human mind has attained in the sphere of morality and religion,--it
   infinitely surpasses all other descriptions of character which we
   possess. Even if not genuine, it has a far greater influence upon our
   moral and religious life, than a thousand maxims of whose genuineness
   no one entertains a doubt. In short, it is too great, too pure, and too
   perfect, to be mere invention.

   Besides, who could have invented it? Is it answered, Many--the whole
   Apostolic Church? Was such a thing ever heard of in the world, as a
   whole community combining to invent a portraiture of character so rich
   in details? How should the Church in general have hit upon such a
   notion and how, since the thing could not take place in a dream, could
   it have set about its execution? And, even admitting the possibility of
   the attempt being made by the Church, would the portrait produced have
   exhibited that harmony which is so decidedly found in the Gospel
   representation of the Lord Jesus? Or is it said that the fiction was
   the work of an individual? How, then, should the image of One sinlessly
   pure and holy have entered into the mind of a sinful human being? And,
   even if this were possible, whence could he, in addition to the idea of
   sinless perfection, derive all those special features and expressions
   which give life and substance to the idea? Such traits and such
   sayings, upon which not only the character of the highest originality
   is everywhere impressed, but to which, moreover, it must at least be
   conceded that they are of such a nature as to render it impossible to
   suppose them to be the mere productions of fancy;--these their inventor
   must, unless they had really been placed before him by the actual life
   of Jesus, have derived from himself and then, as Rousseau strikingly
   observes, the inventor of such an image would be greater and more
   astonishing than his subject. [72] And then we must accord to him what
   we withhold from Christ. Besides, which among such illiterate men as
   the apostles could have been capable of inventing an image which, even
   to the present day, is unsurpassed by the performances of the greatest
   literary geniuses of all ages, nay, is utterly inimitable? If such a
   fiction, moreover, were conceivable, how could its hero have become an
   object for which the very persons who had invented him should feel not
   merely a transitory enthusiasm, but should deliberately and
   perseveringly endure the loss of all things, and at last even suffer
   death? Besides, not only must the image of Jesus have been invented,
   but also the very foundations upon which it is placed in other words,
   the whole system of Christian modes of thought;--a system so utterly
   different from all that preceded it, and one into which the apostles
   themselves were but gradually and reluctantly initiated. Whence, then,
   did this arise, if the Jesus of the Gospels were not its author, and
   Himself but a fiction?

   But we will enlarge no further, as we shall subsequently return to this
   point, especially when treating on the effects produced by the
   manifestation of Jesus. For the present we confine ourselves to one
   remark with respect to the apostolic testimony. Efforts have been made
   to depreciate this by such suggestions as the following:--The apostles,
   it is said, were not so precise in their use of the words in which we
   find the sinlessness of Jesus testified, [73] and meant to express no
   more than Xenophon did concerning Socrates, when he said [74] that he
   had never seen him do an unjust action, or heard him speak an unholy
   word in which words no one would find a testimony to the sinlessness of
   the heathen philosopher. It is also alleged that the testimony of even
   His most intimate associates to the moral character of Jesus is
   confined within very narrow limits they were acquainted with His
   behaviour only during the three years of their intercourse with Him,
   and knew nothing of it in the earlier periods of His life. Besides,
   even during the time they were with Him, they could not see His heart,
   and were thus capable of judging only of the external lawfulness, and
   not of the internal motives of His actions. Hence, the utmost to which
   they could bear witness would be, that they knew of no sin that Jesus
   had committed, not that there was none in Him. [75] The objections here
   suggested are, however, bit very superficial, ignoring, as they do, the
   peculiar position which Jesus occupied with respect to His disciples,
   and failing in a just appreciation of moral development. It is
   undoubtedly true that the apostles, at the very least, testify as much
   concerning Christ as Xenophon asserts concerning Socrates, but it is
   quite as certain that they also go very much further. For Jesus was to
   them not merely what Socrates was to his school,--a noble,
   truth-seeking man, one indefatigably striving after wisdom,--He was, in
   their eyes, Himself the truth, the Son of God, the sole Mediator
   between God and man; and when, in consequence of the impression they
   had themselves received, they attributed sinlessness to One whom they
   viewed in this light, such a statement is undoubtedly one of far deeper
   and more serious import than that of a disciple of Socrates, when he
   says that he had never seen him do an unrighteous act, nor heard him
   speak an unholy word. Nor do the apostles confine themselves to
   negative assertions; but give us a positive portraiture of Jesus, in
   which, in spite of its fragmentary nature, that holy love, which
   entirely excludes the principle of sin, is reflected with a perfection
   which none can descry in the description of Socrates, as given by the
   greatest masters of eloquence.

   With respect, however, to the other objections, it must be granted that
   the apostles in general were acquainted with Jesus only during their
   three years of intimacy with Him. Is the moral life, then, so to speak,
   such a piece of patchwork, that during three years of mature manhood
   its character could be perfection, unless its previous development had
   been of a similar nature? If not, would not every previous sin, of,
   necessity, have so stunted or obscured the moral character of Christ,
   that He could not subsequently have produced the impression of sinless
   perfection? Must not the traces of former sin have been perceived at
   some one juncture? The indissoluble connection of the entire moral
   development enables us here, if anywhere, to infer the character of the
   whole from the part, and the nature of the root from its fruit. But
   besides this, we have the testimony of one intimately acquainted with
   Him from His youth upwards, [76] --the testimony of John the Baptist
   concerning the earlier period of His life. John was himself a man
   surpassing his whole nation in moral elevation, and yet he most
   emphatically acknowledges, both by word and deed, and that in
   comparison with his own person, the utterly unique eminence of Christ.
   This he does, not only by designating Him as one whose shoe's latchet
   he was not worthy to unloose, but also by declaring, at the baptism,
   that he, a sinner, needed to be baptized of Jesus, and by retiring into
   the background from thenceforward, because the greater than he was
   come, who must increase while himself must decrease.

   It is also unquestionably correct to say that the apostles could not
   look immediately into the heart of their Master, and hence could not
   judge with the certainty of Him who searcheth the heart and reins,
   concerning the secret motives of His actions. But does the fact that
   their knowledge of His moral condition was not Divine, make them
   forfeit their claim of being able to pass a human judgment concerning
   His person? This human judgment, when exercised within the province of
   morals, cannot but infer that where the whole external life is pure and
   undefiled, the internal source must be pure and undefiled also, and
   would only be justified in arriving at an opposite conclusion, if
   reasons existed for supposing a contrariety between the outward course
   of action and its inward motives. Had the apostles, then, cause for
   suspecting that the conduct which appeared so irreproachable, could
   have sprung from any but the purest source? If not, they had every
   ground for the assurance that His heart was as pure as His conduct; and
   that because they perceived no sin in it, there was no sin in Him.

   Men are not generally too much given to the weakness of believing in
   moral excellence, much less in an entirely spotless virtue. When, then,
   such a belief strangely enough exists, and exhibits such powers of
   endurance as it does in the case of the apostles, we are certainly
   justified in the view that there must exist also a real objective
   reason, and a moral subjective necessity, for this belief.

   Least of all can those who allow the sinless perfection of Christ
   oppose the possibility of its historical manifestation. If this
   sinlessness was actual, it must also have been perceptible by man. For
   would it not be the most monstrous contradiction, that a moral
   phenomenon, which must have been of the greatest importance to the
   whole human race, should actually have occurred, but in such wise that
   no one was capable of obtaining any certain knowledge and assurance
   concerning it? This would be a revelation, but one which revealed
   nothing to any man. [77]

   Too much, however, must not be asserted. Apostolic testimony, valuable
   as it is, does not furnish us with an absolute guarantee. This it could
   only do, if, referring it to inspiration, we acknowledge its authority
   to be of directly Divine origin. The whole course of our argument,
   however, requires us to seek for confirmation and completion in another
   quarter; and this is furnished to us in that testimony of Jesus to
   Himself which we have now to adduce as a proof of His sinlessness: for
   though it may indeed be said of the apostles that they were incapable
   of seeing His heart, the same cannot be affirmed of Himself.

   [40] The expressions 'separate from sinners' and higher than the

   first instance, in a local sense, but they are at the same time as
   certainly employed to symbolize that inward elevation of an ethical and
   metaphysical kind, which the writer attributes to Christ. They denote a
   state of most perfect fellowship with God, far surpassing aught
   attained by sinful creatures, and proved to be such by the
   super-mundane glory of its possessor. The entrance upon such a state
   naturally presupposes the absolute sinlessness and holiness of Him who
   is raised thereto: hence this, if it had not been most expressly
   affirmed in the former expression, would be decidedly asserted even by
   the latter. Compare the full discussion of this subject in Riehm's

   Sec. 2.--The Testimony of Jesus to Himself.

   The Lord Jesus must best have known what was in Himself. Hence, the
   manner and nature in which He gave expression to His own moral
   consciousness, must naturally be of the most decided importance. The
   impression He produced on others, and their consequent conviction, must
   not, as is self-evident, be absent. Yet this might be but the echo of
   what originally proceeded from Jesus Himself; and hence, in the very
   nature of the thing, His own utterances on the subject must form the
   final and culminating testimony on which we embrace the persuasion of
   His sinlessness.

   And, first, even the negative side of His testimony is in the highest
   degree remarkable. [78] As might be expected from one so holy, our Lord
   everywhere stood in most decided antagonism to sin: He drew it forth to
   light, rebuked, and opposed it to the uttermost nay, His whole life was
   devoted to maintaining a conflict against it. On the other hand, He was
   ever merciful to the penitent sinner, and bestowed commendations on
   those who, in the consciousness of their sinfulness, humbled themselves
   before God. [79] Now, He who had so keen a perception for the sins of
   others, must--unless we suppose Him utterly self-deluded--have had as
   keen a one for sin in Himself. But we nowhere hear from Him--as we do
   from even the very best of other men--so much as an occasional
   expression of a consciousness of sin. There is no humbling of Himself
   before God for sin, no prayer for forgiveness. [80] Does not this most
   decidedly show that the source from which these feelings
   proceed--feelings which are found just where the moral character is
   most eminent--had in Him no existence whatever? It may also be
   indirectly inferred from what He said at His baptism, [81] that He felt
   an inward consciousness that He needed for Himself neither repentance
   nor regeneration. [82] He required from all, without exception, who
   would enter into the kingdom of God, that they should be born again of
   water and of the Spirit; [83] while for Himself such a thing is out of
   the question. A development, a being made perfect, did indeed take
   place in His case but a catastrophe in which the old man should die to
   sin, and the new and Divine man be born in Him, is not only nowhere
   hinted at, but is, moreover, utterly irreconcilable with the image
   which the Gospels present of the Lord Jesus. Nay, more far from
   manifesting any need of repentance and forgiveness, He claims, on the
   contrary, with respect to sinners, the high position of One not only
   able to proclaim the forgiveness of sins, but to bestow it. [84] He
   actually forgives the penitent in virtue of an authority which He
   evidently regards as one directly inherent in Himself. Could this be
   the case with a man who found guilt and sin in himself? Would not such
   an act, if there were no sufficient grounds for it, have been one of
   unparalleled audacity,--an encroachment upon the prerogative of God
   Himself? [85] It is obvious that Jesus could only be justified in such
   an assumption by, the felt consciousness of perfect oneness with
   God,--a consciousness, again, arising from a feeling of perfect freedom
   from sin. In virtue of such a consciousness, moreover, could He alone
   have committed to His disciples a power to become the mediums of
   forgiveness after He had communicated to them the gift of the Holy
   Ghost. [86]

   His positive testimony, however, goes much further. And here we have,
   first of all, to notice that weighty and important saying of Jesus,
   which we find in St. John's Gospel: Which of you convinceth me of sin?'
   [87] We no sooner hear such words, than we feel they must have
   proceeded from One whose moral constitution was of the most peculiar
   kind and this impression is still further strengthened, when we
   remember that He who uttered them was a Person whose whole life was a
   model of truthfulness and humility. Every man, without exception, must
   immediately feel conscious that he cannot echo the mighty yet simple
   saying,--that for him, unable as he is to turn a deaf ear to the
   testimony of conscience, to apply it to himself, would be either empty
   fanaticism or miserable self-deception. Least of all could this happen
   within the sphere of Christian life, where the conscience is rendered
   in so high a degree acute, by a perfect revelation both of the moral
   law and the Divine holiness, and out of which that same apostle who has
   preserved this memorable saying of our Lord exclaims, If we say we have
   no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.' [88] It is
   in contradistinction to this, that One steps forth from the ranks of
   sinful human nature with the question, Which of you convinceth me of
   sin?

   But the meaning of this question must be somewhat more closely
   determined. The very word [89] on which most depends has been variously
   understood. We have translated it simply 'sin,' as Luther and the
   authorized English version render it; but the word requires a fuller
   investigation. The Greek expression, which here comes under notice,
   has, as is well known, the general signification of failure
   (Verfehlen). This general idea, again, is specially applied in a
   twofold sense: it either means a failure in the sphere of mind, and
   then it is error, mistake, untruth; or it means a failure in the domain
   of morals, and then it is known as sin, perversion of will, wrong. The
   word is used in the former sense (though only under a certain
   assumption) in classical Greek; in the latter sense it is used in
   Hellenistic, and especially in New Testament Greek. From the earliest
   times commentators have differed with regard to this twofold use of the
   word in their exposition of the passage under consideration. Some have
   maintained that Jesus intended, by this expression, to claim for
   Himself exemption from error; [90] others have held that He claimed
   freedom from sin; [91] while some have included the two ideas in one,
   making the question of Christ imply a reference both to error and to
   sin--any aberration, whether intellectual or moral, from the true and
   right way. Others, again, have been of opinion that the word sin is
   here best rendered deception. [92] The two last opinions we may at once
   set aside, as warranted neither by the use of language nor by the
   occasion, and as having at best only a probability in their favour; but
   the two first expositions require a more detailed investigation.

   The view according to which Jesus asks, Which of you convinceth me of
   error?' would seem to be favoured by the context. Immediately before,
   He had designated His Jewish antagonists children of Satan, the
   man-murderer, the liar from the beginning, implying that theirs was a
   temper which proved their relationship to Satan, in that they refused
   to believe on Him who taught the truth of God, and even persecuted Him
   to the death. Then He asks, Which of you convinceth me of error?' [93]
   --with which is closely connected (for throughout the whole passage the
   contrast between truth and error, i.e. falsehood, is held fast) the
   further question: And if I say (not falsehood, but) the truth, why do
   ye not believe me?'

   Now, supposing this explanation of the passage to be the correct one,
   even then the passage would be of great importance for our purpose, for
   it would at least contain an indirect testimony to the religious and
   moral purity of Jesus. For if He claims exemption from error in the
   province which here comes under consideration,--viz. that of morality
   and religion,--does not this imply that He also attributes to Himself
   purity of inward nature and outward conduct in the same province? For
   freedom from sin presupposes freedom from error, and vice versâ,--the
   two act and react upon each other. Unquestionably the two in the sense
   of the New Testament, and especially of that Gospel in which this
   saying of Jesus is found, form one connected whole, just as their
   opposites, sin and untruth, do. [94]

   But this explanation cannot be regarded as correct. In the first place,
   there attaches to it a verbal difficulty, which it is not easy to set
   aside. In classical usage, the word (hamartia) never occurs in the
   sense of error, without having beside it a modifying and determining
   clause or word. [95] In the New Testament it is very uncertain whether
   it can be satisfactorily shown that the word ever does occur in this
   sense; [96] least of all can this be shown in the use of the word in
   St. John's writings,--the idea He attaches to it being invariably that
   of sin. But the objections which arise from the passage itself, viewed
   with reference to the context, are still greater. Were we to adopt this
   explanation, there would, in the first place, be no progress in the
   argument; and this verse would not supply the reason or motive of what
   is said in the preceding verse. For when Jesus in that verse (John
   viii. 45) said, I speak the truth,' He made a statement which required
   to be proved. Now, if in the 46th verse He asks, Which of you
   convinceth me of error?' this would be a mere repetition, in a negative
   form, of the statement already made in a positive form, and by no means
   an argument in proof of it. Secondly, such a rendering of the word
   would destroy the analogy of the contrast which Jesus draws between
   Satan and the Jews on the one hand, and Himself, as the Son of God, on
   the other. For if, in the first part, regard is had not only to what is
   intellectually true, but, above all, to the moral condition, this must
   be the case in the second clause also. Thirdly, the notion that because
   they could convict Him of no error, they must believe on Him, would be
   one which would be in itself inadmissible; [97] for it would make
   intellectual demonstration the basis of faith, whereas true faith rests
   upon a direct attraction of the heart to the salvation revealed in
   Christ.

   If we now take up the second explanation of the passage, Which of you
   convinceth me of sin?' we shall find all these difficulties disappear.
   To this rendering there is no verbal objection; it falls in admirably
   with the context; it supplies a proof of the statement just made. Jesus
   had previously maintained, in opposition to the unbelief of His
   hearers, that He spoke the truth; [98] and, as a pledge that He did so,
   He appeals to the fact that no one could convince Him of sin,--thus
   making His moral purity the guarantee of the truth of His doctrine. The
   idea might be rendered as follows:--Jesus had in his mind the contrast
   between truth and falsehood [99] already pointed out, and by including
   falsehood, i.e. the special, in sin, i.e. the general, He arrives at
   the conclusion: If I am free from sin, I must also be free from
   falsehood, for falsehood is sinful; and if I do not speak falsehood,
   then I speak the truth, and ye have no reason to withhold from me your
   faith.' The entire argument He does not, however, express in words: the
   middle clause remains unspoken--viz. that He is free also from
   falsehood; and He goes on at once from the repudiation of sinfulness,
   to the positive contrary which follows from His sinlessness--viz. His
   speaking the truth. [100] But there seems to be something artificial in
   introducing the idea of falsehood, which is in fact unnecessary. The
   thought is not only clear, but it becomes more forcible when we keep
   simply to those statements which Jesus has put in immediate connection.
   Generally speaking, the argument is founded upon the principle that
   there is an inseparable connection between the moral and the
   intellectual; and it is from a consciousness of this connection that
   Jesus says, As you, my opponents, reject me, and in me reject the
   truth, because your temper is sinful--is satanic; so, on the other
   hand, can I lawfully present myself as one who speaks the truth,
   because I am free from sin.' The conclusion is at once and immediately
   drawn--from the fact that He is free from sin, and from the moral
   purity of His character--to the truth of His words, and to the
   obligation lying upon His hearers to believe in Him, who was thus
   accredited: and this is a thought which is so consistent with all that
   fell from the lips of Christ, according to St. John's Gospel, that it
   cannot appear in the slightest degree strange to any one acquainted
   with this document. [101] At all events, it is certain that Jesus in
   this passage expresses directly, as in previous passages He had
   indicated indirectly, [102] His consciousness of freedom from sin and
   this it is which really concerns us.

   But with regard to this testimony of Jesus, two objections have now to
   be obviated: first, it is of a subjective character, and, as such, does
   not of itself afford a complete proof of sinlessness secondly, it is
   purely negative, expressing simply a consciousness of the absence of
   sin, not a consciousness of positive perfection of life. But neither of
   these two considerations can at all weaken the validity which we claim
   for this evidence.

   With regard to the former. If we are to attain to an assured conviction
   of the sinlessness of Jesus, this is only possible on the supposition
   that, above all things, He Himself possessed such a conviction. It was
   only from Himself that the idea could go forth to those around Him. He
   Himself knew best what was in Him, [103] and only in the lively
   expression of His own self-consciousness could the opinion which others
   formed concerning Him find its stay and strength. There can be no doubt
   that the self-consciousness of Jesus must at the same time find its
   objective vindication, and such vindication is abundant; but this would
   be but unreliable and insecure, were it not that it rests upon the
   self-testimony of Jesus. And this could not possibly consist of aught
   else than a simple word of assertion. Every assertion concerning one's
   own state of heart and mind is of a subjective kind but this
   circumstance does not in the least degree diminish its value when it is
   spoken by an intelligent and truthful man, because, from the very
   nature of the case, it cannot be otherwise. The assertion of Christ
   that He was free from sin, even though merely subjective, entirely
   satisfies us whenever we assign to it its proper place, and regard it
   not as constituting the whole evidence of His sinlessness, but as an
   indispensable portion of it, which has its full import only when viewed
   in connection with the rest. [104]

   With regard to the second point, it is true that when Jesus in the
   passage in question pronounces Himself free from sin, He makes only a
   negative statement. But the positive assertions required to render it
   complete are also to be found in rich abundance. Not to dwell on the
   fact that the sinlessness which Jesus asserted, both in general, and
   particularly in the midst of the sinful world around Him, could only
   have been substantiated by a life of most positive holiness, they will
   be found in a whole series of most emphatic sayings, in which all that
   could be desired, on this point, is very completely expressed.

   Jesus calls Himself the Light of the World, and the King who is come
   into the world to bear witness to the truth; therefore not merely a
   light among other lights, but the light which lighteth every man; and
   not merely one among many witnesses to truth, but the King of Truth,
   who can be but One. He designates Himself as the Way, the Truth, and
   the Life; [105] and would hence be regarded not as one who merely shows
   the way, but as Him who is the way, and who, as embracing and
   manifesting in His own Person the true life and the living truth, leads
   to the Father. He also says [106] that it is His meat to do the will of
   Him that sent Him, and to finish His work; He testifies [107] that He
   does at all times the things which please the Father,--that He never
   seeks His own will, but always the will of the Father. [108] He holds
   Himself up as the glorifier of the name of the Father in the world, who
   sanctifies Himself for His people, who has overcome the world, and who
   imparts a peace which the world cannot give. [109] He invites all the
   weary and heavy-laden to come unto Him, because in Him and in His
   Person they will find rest for their souls. [110] Do we not
   instinctively feel that these are expressions which cannot proceed from
   the mouth of a sinful man, which can only fall from the lips of One
   whose character and life far surpass all that is sinful and human? What
   mere man, even though he were the wisest and most exalted that ever
   lived, could invite all, without exception, to come unto Himself, with
   the promise that they should find true rest for their souls?

   Two far more important passages, however, must also come under
   consideration in this respect,--the one, I and my Father are one;'
   [111] the other, He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.' [112] If
   with reference to the former passage it may be disputed whether the
   words, I and my Father are one,' imply a unity of nature, a unity of
   power, or a moral unity, still it matters little for our purpose which
   explanation is preferred for every kind of oneness with God, in that
   supreme sense in which Christ lays claim to it, must result from that
   moral union with which alone we are here concerned,--from unity of
   will. Where the will, the whole moral being, is in any respect turned
   away from God, there can be no perfect oneness with God in any sense
   whatever. Where, on the contrary, real union with the will of God
   exists, there of necessity sin cannot be found, but only that holy love
   which is the motive power of the Divine will. [113]

   There can, then, be no doubt that the Lord Jesus both felt and
   expressed the consciousness of His own sinlessness. If we are unwilling
   to admit the validity of this self-testimony, unique as it is,--if we
   will put no confidence in His sublime words,--there remains no
   alternative but to regard Him as either a fanatic or a hypocrite. We
   must either declare that, as far as Himself was concerned, He drew no
   very strict line of demarcation between good and evil,--that He made no
   searching examination of the secret recesses of His heart,--was not
   acquainted with every motion of His will,--did not strictly test His
   words and actions,--and that He exaggerated a consciousness of noble
   aspirations into the overweening notion of being sinlessly perfect; or
   we must admit the still more fearful alternative, that while conscious
   of transgressing God's commandments in thought, word, and deed, He yet
   expressly bore testimony to the very opposite. In this case, He who in
   every other respect gives us the impression only of the most perfect
   purity and sincerity,--who ever manifested the utmost antagonism to
   hypocrisy of every kind,--would be branded as a sanctimonious
   hypocrite, and a contradiction would be introduced into His moral
   nature, by which it would be utterly destroyed. Who is there that would
   be willing to undertake the defence of such an assertion?

   If, then, the rejection of the self-testimony of the Lord Jesus leads
   us only to untenable, nay, to unworthy conclusions, faith in this
   testimony, though resting on no demonstrative foundation, yet appears
   to be perfectly justifiable to reason, and is alone worthy of our moral
   dignity. Where there are no reasons to the contrary, confidence is far
   nobler and more dignified than distrust. But when we have a Person
   whose statements are in all respects corroborated in so unique a
   manner, as is here the case, it becomes a moral duty not to refuse our
   confidence to that which He simply yet solemnly asserts concerning
   Himself.

   And this will appear still more in the light of a duty, when we add to
   His self-testimony that external corroboration to the consideration of
   which we now proceed.

   [89] hamartia.

   [90] This explanation occurs in Origen, in his Commentary on John (vol.
   xx. § 25). Kypke tries to justify it on philological grounds, in his
   observations on the passage. On the other side see Lücke, Commentary on
   St. John, Pt. 2, pp. 298-301, ed. second; and Meyer's Commentary, pp.
   243, 244, ed. second.

   [91] So many ancient and also the best among modern expositors,--e.g.
   Olshausen, Lücke, De Wette, and Meyer.

   [92] The former is the view of Weber, in his already quoted Programm,
   p. 185, who thinks: Nomen hamartias, non solum theoreticam sed etiam
   practicam aberrationem a vero et recto simul continere. The latter is
   proposed by Fritzsche, Commentat. ii. 2, pp. 7, etc. Comp. my article
   Polemisches,' etc.

   [93] According to one view of the passage,--that, according to Stier,
   of John v. Müller,--a view in which there seems to be a transition from
   the sublime to the ridiculous,--the sense of this question is made to
   be: Is there anything illogical in my inferences?

   [94] On this connection, compare Frommann, Doctrine of St. John (S.
   181-309, 550-654, etc.).

   [95] See references (e.g. Plato, de Leg. i. 627, 668; Thucydides, i.

   [96] The passages, 1 Cor. xv. 34, Titus iii. 11, prove nothing
   conclusively.

   [97] So even De Wette (in his Exeget. Handbuch) on this passage.

   [98] Verse 44: Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your
   father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not
   in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie,
   he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.'

   [99] aletheia and pseudos.

   [100] This is also Meyer's view of the train of thought. See Comment.
   S. 244. So, too, Schumann, Christus, B. i. p. 287.

   [101] Meyer (Comment. p. 243) is of opinion, that to maintain either,
   with Lücke, that the Sinless One is the purest and surest organ of
   knowledge and medium of truth;' or with De Wette, that the knowledge of
   truth rests on the purity of the will,'--would be to presuppose a
   knowledge of the truth attained by Jesus in a discursive manner, or at
   least in His human state, while His knowledge, especially according to
   St. John's teaching, was intuitively possessed before His earthly
   existence, and then maintained only by constant communion with God. But
   the objection is not to the point. The question is, not how He acquired
   His perfect knowledge of the truth, but how this was to be proved. For
   this proof, Christ appeals directly to His sinlessness; for this is,
   under all circumstances, a condition by which alone a perfect knowledge
   of religious truth could even intuitively exist and be recognised.

   [102] He did so when in verses 32-36 He called the Jews the slaves of
   sin, and designated Himself as the truth which maketh free. This, it is
   obvious, He could only be, by being free from that sin which enslaved
   and obscured His adversaries.

   [103] 2 Cor. ii. 10.

   [104] This is the only correct answer to the objection urged by
   Fritzsche (Comment. i. 21), and by the earliest opponents of Christ
   (John viii. 13), that a man's testimony concerning himself is not
   valid. It is true, indeed, that if it stands alone it could not, under
   all circumstances, and in all relations, be regarded as conclusive; but
   when it is asserted that in a case like this it is of no value
   whatever, this is to transfer, in a most illogical way, a principle of
   law to the domain of morals, and to apply a presumption gathered from
   the darkest experience of life, and one which is in daily life regarded
   as an insult among men of honour, to Him who has called Himself the
   King of Truth, and in whose mouth was found no guile' (Haze,
   Streitschriften, iii. 109, 110). It is however, utterly unfitting to
   maintain, as Fritzsche (Comment. 2, pp 4-6), following the precedent of
   Weber, and laying special emphasis on elenchei, does, that if it be sin
   which is really meant in this passage, even then Jesus says nothing
   more than what any holiest man living a life of obedience to law might
   say as well as He,--viz. that no one was able to prove him guilty of
   any sin! Such an explanation deprives the words of all their
   importance, and makes them utterly unworthy of the Lord Jesus. For
   surely it was not possible that He should, with worldly wisdom, thus
   take refuge in the outward legality of His actions, so far as these
   might happen to be known to those who were then about Him. No; when,
   conscious that in Himself the external action and the internal motive
   were in perfect harmony, He asserted the impossibility of convincing
   Him of sin in general, He assuredly intended to express also the purity
   of His moral consciousness,--the sinlessness of His inner life. Compare
   Lücke, Comment. zu Johann. p. 299, second ed.; De Wette, Exeg.
   Handbuch, 118; Hase, Streitschriften, iii. 109; and especially Stier,
   Reden Jesu, iv. 427. The latter aptly remarks: Christ could not have
   asked the question (John viii. 46), unless He had been conscious that
   there was in Him no sin in the sight of God. If He who so spoke had any
   secret consciousness of sin before God, He would have sinned by the
   very act of uttering such words.'

CHAPTER II.

  THE SINLESSNESS OF CHRIST PROVED FROM THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY HIS
  MANIFESTATION.

   EVERY personality bearing the impress of clearly defined moral and
   religious qualities, will produce effects proportioned to the degree of
   force it possesses. The greater and the purer this force, the deeper,
   the more enduring, and the more wide-spread will be the effects
   resulting therefrom. If, however, a personality perfectly religious and
   moral should have existed,--if there ever had been One who was
   sinlessly holy,--the effects produced would have been of a kind
   entirely unique. And, on the other hand, if we actually meet with such
   effects, we have every reason to infer the existence of a proportionate
   force as their cause. The question, then, is: Do there exist in the
   special religious and moral constitution of the Christian, as
   essentially distinguished from the præ-Christian and the
   extra-Christian world, actual phenomena, which can only be
   satisfactorily explained on the assumption that the Author of
   Christianity was a Being of sinless holiness, and which, if this
   assumption is rejected, remain entirely inexplicable? We answer this
   question in the affirmative; and shall endeavour, in what follows, to
   maintain our assertion.

   In so doing, while we distinguish between the religious and moral
   element, we would not, in an argument which must naturally have respect
   to the very essence of the Christian character, be understood to do so
   in the sense of regarding either as constituting separate and isolated
   spheres within the domain of Christian life. On the contrary, it is in
   the perfect union of these two elements that we recognise not only a
   leading feature, but a leading excellence of Christianity. Nor do we
   only recognise, but shall very decidedly bring forward this property
   with reference to the sinlessness of its Founder. Nevertheless, the
   religious and moral elements admit of being distinguished the one from
   the other, just as man in his inward relation to God, may be
   distinguished from man in his external operations; and each presents a
   different aspect to our contemplation. We shall therefore, in the first
   place, consider them separately; and shall commence our observations by
   viewing the Christian life from its moral side, as that which is most
   perceptible and prominent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sec. 1.--The New Life of Christianity in its Moral and Religious
   Aspects.

   The moral effects of Christianity are undeniable. It has in all ages
   produced, in those who have been deservedly called believers, a rich
   supply of virtues, and, indeed, of virtues which were not previously in
   existence, or at least not in so pure a form. This applies chiefly to
   humility, and to compassionate, ministering love. Nor has it exercised
   a less salutary moral influence upon the social relations of life. In
   marriage, and in the family, in civil and political life, in the
   relation of ranks, tribes, and nations to each other,--nay, in the
   whole condition of the human race,--it was Christianity which first
   laid the foundation of a state of society truly worthy of man. And
   these changes it has accomplished, not from without, not by any kind of
   constraint, but essentially from within, and by mere moral force. But
   chiefly have they been brought about by the fact, that, through the
   influence of Christianity, the godlike, free personality of man, and
   the equality of all men before God have been really recognised as they
   had never been before. All this irresistibly points to the abundance
   and depth of the moral forces inherent in Christianity. For the origin
   of these forces, however, we must necessarily go back to its Author and
   this alone is, at all events, strong testimony to the singularly
   prominent position He occupies in the domain of morals. But when our
   special subject is the doctrine of His sinlessness, all that has
   hitherto been touched upon may be considered as essentially comprised
   in one leading point, namely this, that the sum-total of these moral
   results makes it obvious that Christianity produced something new in
   the moral world, something which is utterly inexplicable, unless it be
   assumed that the Author of this creation was sinless and pure.

   The idea of a new moral creation is one as peculiar to Christianity as
   it is indispensable to its completeness. This the Apostle Paul
   expresses in the most forcible manner when he says, If any man be in
   Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all
   things are become new.' [114] The whole aim of Christianity is, that
   the old man of sin and selfishness may be destroyed, and a new man of
   righteousness and holiness, of self-denying love, may be born, first in
   the individual, then in ever increasing circles--in the nations, and in
   the whole human race. This new birth is not a mere doctrine to be
   stated, but an actual occurrence to be brought about in the heart, and
   visibly manifested in the life. The apostle affirms the reality of this
   occurrence in his case, from his own experience; but to all others who
   had eyes to see, it was undeniably confirmed by the fact that Saul of
   Tarsus had become Paul the Apostle, who was not only walking on an
   entirely different path of life, but was also impelled by an entirely
   new principle. [115] Paul is, however, in this respect only a type of
   Christians in general. The same occurrence, though it may be less
   distinctly marked, is repeated in the case of all who may be called
   Christians, in heart as well as in name. And the more decided
   Christians they are, the more will they be penetrated by the
   consciousness that Christianity has begotten in them a new life, and
   the more clearly will this be manifested in their whole life and
   conversation.

   If, however, we are to define in general terms that new moral principle
   which distinguishes the Christian from the præ-Christian world, we
   should say that it is a principle of moral perfection surpassing both
   nature and the law, and whose ultimate aim is an actual freedom from
   all sin. Before the entrance of Christianity into the world, we find,
   on the one hand, in heathenism a surrender of the individual life to
   nature, without any decided consciousness of sin; on the other hand, in
   Judaism an overwhelming consciousness of sin, produced by the
   revelation of the Divine holiness, and by the strictness of the law,
   but unaccompanied by the vital power and confidence necessary to
   overcome it. If it be true that in the heathen world the life of nature
   was, in the case of certain nations, ennobled into something supremely
   beautiful, and even that certain great prophetic spirits were able to
   rise, to a certain degree, above its limits,--if it be true that in the
   domain of Judaism there was, beside the consciousness of sin, a
   consciousness of grace; yet, on the whole, the heathen and their gods
   were under the dominion of nature, which mind may glorify, but cannot
   overcome; while the Jews were in presence of the holy God, under the
   curse of sin, which the law could indeed give the knowledge of, and
   place under outward restraints, but was utterly unable to eradicate and
   subdue. When Christianity appeared, it broke the power of nature, and
   redeemed it from the curse of the law. For it is self-evident that a
   life determined only by natural motives is not to be thought of within
   the sphere of Christianity. By means of Christianity, moreover, the
   life will also rise above the essentially legal grade. The place of the
   law will be occupied by a morality made free from within,--a morality
   for which the law is no longer written on tables of stone, but on
   fleshy tables of the heart; and which, having its origin in Divine
   grace, and being conscious of this origin, cherishes also the assurance
   that, at some stage of its development, it will become free from sin.

   Where, then, are we to seek the originating cause of this new creation,
   which we find in the moral life of the Christian world? Not, as every
   well-informed person will allow, in the moral precepts of Christianity.
   For it is not in the nature of mere precepts to vitalize: life can only
   be generated by life, and neither moral law nor moral ideas can produce
   entirely new characters. To form these, there is needed a character of
   a typical kind. But, true as this is in general, it especially holds
   good in Christianity. Here the moral precepts, great as is their
   excellence, by no means occupy the first place,--they do but spring
   from a primary source, whence all creative and vitalizing power is
   derived. This primary source is the Person of Christ, to which, in this
   case also, we are ultimately referred. The same apostle who, both by
   word and deed, bore such decided testimony to the new creation, says
   also, when stating the ultimate cause of that new life which was in
   him, I live yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.' [116] In the important
   passage, also, [117] from which our argument started, he connects the
   fact of any one being a new creature, not with his walking according to
   Christ's doctrine, but with his being in Christ,' i.e. personally
   united to Him. [118] And in so doing, he does but express the
   experience of every true Christian in every age. For all Christians
   will agree that it is not from ideas, doctrines, or precepts that they
   derive, and have derived, the regenerating power but from the personal
   life, or living personality of Christ, who has been formed, or at least
   has begun to be formed, in them.

   If, then, the primary source of this new life--in which sin is
   conquered as to its principle, and the pledge of its final and complete
   subjugation bestowed--is inward fellowship with a real personality,
   what must have been the nature of this personality, that it should have
   produced such an effect? Evidently it could not have been itself
   subject to sin, for then it would have differed from others only in
   degree, and would thus have still partaken of the old nature. It would
   not have realized in itself a nature entirely new, nor would it have
   been capable of laying the foundation of a new moral creation, whose
   ultimate aim should be perfect freedom from sin. On the contrary, it
   must have been a personality actually withdrawn from all connection
   with the old nature,--one in which the power of sin was entirely
   broken,--one which, being itself in the highest sense a new beginning,
   was thus capable of exercising that deep, far-reaching, creative
   influence, which nothing but that which was possessed of original
   perfection could command.

   To the objection, that the effect produced by the sinlessness of
   Christ, if this sinlessness is to be believed, would really have been
   to produce in those who came under the influence of His life a like and
   immediate freedom from sin, but that neither in the apostles, nor in
   the Christian world in general, were such results manifested our reply
   is as follows:--In the first place, we do actually find in the
   apostles, and in all true Christians, a something which is here of the
   greatest importance we find in them the principle of sin broken, and
   the assurance of its final and complete overthrow implanted. And this
   furnishes us with a pledge that a decisive victory has already been
   achieved over sin. If, however, in spite of its conquest in principle,
   it is still found operating in their lives, yet with this circumstance
   is always connected the certainty, that the reason thereof is to be
   found, not in any inadequacy of the purifying and sanctifying influence
   exercised upon them by Christ, but in the fact that sin is too deeply
   rooted in nature to be overcome at once, to be eradicated by any other
   than an arduous and gradual process. On the other hand, they have a
   conviction that they can only be more and more, and at last entirely,
   cleansed from sin, by a complete surrender to the renovating influence
   of Christ and such a conviction can be based on nothing but an
   assurance of the fulness, purity, and infinite efficacy of that holy,
   sinless life which is found in the Person of Jesus Christ.

   It is evident, then, that if we assume the Author of Christianity to
   have been Himself subject to sin, it is impossible to comprehend how
   Christian morality, in its purest and most complete form, could have
   originated from such a being, and how its special nature could be
   expressed by the words, Old things are passed away all things are
   become new.' If, on the contrary, we acknowledge that its Founder was
   without sin, it is but natural that a really new moral creation should
   take place, within its sphere, through the fact that Christ is formed
   in the individual believer, and in believers collectively.

   In Christianity, however, the moral element entirely depends upon the
   religious. Whenever we meet with a peculiar feature in the province of
   morals, we shall have to assume a corresponding one in that of religion
   and if in Christianity the moral life has been radically renewed, the
   religious consciousness must also have previously experienced a similar
   change.

   What, then, is it which in this respect characterizes Christians, and
   makes a marked difference between them and all other religious
   communities? It is the fact that they regard themselves as reconciled
   to God and redeemed; that they cherish the assurance that, in the case
   of all who truly repent and believe, the guilt of sin is abolished, and
   a filial relationship to the holy God introduced. It was by means of
   this consciousness that the Christian Church was called into existence.
   Possessing this, whatever else she may be deficient in, she does not
   cease to be Christian; without it, she might still be a religious
   community of some undefined kind, but could no longer be entitled a
   Christian one. Least of all could she lay any claim to a new life, in
   the Christian sense of the term; for this cannot exist apart from a
   confidence that the guilt of sin is done away with, and a way of access
   opened to God as a merciful Father.

   If, then, we find such a confidence existing in the Christian Church,
   and perceive, moreover, that by this confidence she either stands or
   falls, it is but reasonable to inquire whence it originated. The
   præ-Christian religions also had an abundant supply of means and
   ordinances for reconciling sinful man to God; and among these,
   sacrifices played by far the most important part. But if we ask after
   the result, we find that all they could effect was to allay, for a
   time, the feeling of guilt, while guilt itself was never radically
   abolished, nor the certainty that it was once for all taken away,
   begotten. Hence the need of repeated sacrifices was felt; and men were
   ever moving in the same circle of fresh sacrifices, and ever-recurring
   consciousness of sin, without attaining the satisfaction of an enduring
   peace with God. The reason of this was, that in this case sacrifice was
   nothing more than mere sacrifice, and more or less external to man, and
   that the assurance of pardon was unaccompanied by the destruction of
   the power of sin, and the implantation of a new life in its place.
   There was thus an attempted atonement for sin, but no real redemption
   from its power. A full and final atonement is only possible when it is
   personally effected, when a person intervenes, who not only by a
   voluntary self-surrender offers himself as a sacrifice, but also
   possesses the power of begetting in those who are inwardly united to
   him a new life,--a life really victorious over sin, by means of that
   perfect confidence of its pardon which is called forth by an actual
   revelation and communication of Divine grace. Here the atoning efficacy
   and the redeeming power coincide. And this coincidence being found only
   in Christianity, it may readily be perceived what kind of person could
   alone give to the Christian world the assurance that it was perfectly
   reconciled and really redeemed by him. Such an assurance could not be
   grounded upon a sinful man,--it could rest only upon one sinlessly
   holy; and it is only when we recognise the Author of Christianity to
   have been such a Being, that we can conceive how the religion which He
   founded could be pre-eminently the religion of atonement and
   redemption.

   If, then, there is any reality in the consciousness of atonement and
   redemption possessed by Christians, this reality presupposes the
   existence of the condition under which alone it could have originated.
   And that this consciousness is a reality, is founded upon the fact of
   the experience of each individual believer. The doctrine of the sinless
   perfection of Jesus is therefore as secure as the experienced fact of
   His atoning and redeeming agency: they who would deny the former must
   also deny the latter, and will be either utterly incapable of
   explaining the phenomenon of Christian piety, in its most
   characteristic peculiarity, or be constrained to seek for an
   explanation by which it will be as good as explained away.

   their connection require, as a concrete reference to the Person of
   Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sec. 2.--Morality and Religion united in Holiness.

   Another circumstance must now be taken into consideration. Not only
   have morality and religion, individually considered, appeared under new
   aspects in Christianity, but a blending of the two, such as had never
   before existed, has been by it introduced into human life. This union
   of the religious and moral elements, which we call Holiness, is the
   highest quality attainable by man, and furnishes another point whence
   the sinlessness of Jesus may be inferred.

   Undoubtedly a reciprocity of action between religion and morals may be
   found even beyond the province of Christianity. All vigorous piety
   manifests itself by moral results, and all deep morality is in some way
   or other based upon piety. If we conceive of either as existing
   independently, as entirely severed from the other, we should have, on
   the one side, a piety either of a sickly and internal character,
   confining itself to contemplation and emotion, or consisting solely of
   merely outward observances; on the other, a morality which, keeping
   closely within the bounds of legality, would exhibit a virtue, strict
   perhaps, and immoveable, but austere, and lacking all genuine warmth
   and heartiness. We are not, however, speaking of a greater or less
   degree of reciprocal action, but of a perfect fusion,--of such a
   oneness of religion and morality, that the one can never be found
   without the other;--no feeling of piety without moral worth and moral
   results, and no moral action which does not spring from piety. For
   holiness, as a human quality, exists only where a being, who has either
   continued free from sin, or, having sinned, has again become free from
   every stain of guilt, and victorious over every temptation, is ever,
   both in will and deed, following after good; and this not only from
   motives of duty, not merely for the sake of good itself, but for the
   sake of God; impelled, therefore, by that love which, like the Divine
   love itself, finds its objects even in the undeserving and the lost,
   and is ready to make any sacrifice for their deliverance.

   Where, then, do we find even the notion of such a holiness as this?

   We cannot seek for it in the heathen world. Even here the distinction
   between the profane and the sacred, between the impure and the
   consecrated, was understood, and its nobler spirits, at least,
   conceived that the pure alone could be worthy of fellowship with
   Divinity. But the Divine itself was not in its view perfectly holy.
   Heathenism is essentially the religion of nature, and consists either
   in the deification of nature, or the introduction of the Divine into
   natural life. This naturally and necessarily excluded from the sphere
   of the Divine the stricter notion of holiness; and where this was
   already wanting in the province of religion, it would be vain to seek
   for its impression in that of morals. In fact, though we do find in the
   ancient world the ideas of justice, of virtue, and of the good and
   beautiful, we by no means meet with that of holiness.

   The revelation of the Old Testament is based on an entirely different
   foundation. Here the holiness of God, the free Creator and Governor of
   the world, forms the central-point, and the precept, Be ye holy, for I
   am holy,' [119] is, as it were, the root-word of the ancient covenant,
   the whole aim of which is to sanctify all to Jehovah, and to hallow all
   through Him. But, powerfully as this key-note pervades the whole of the
   Old Testament dispensation, the revelation of the Divine holiness
   itself is not as yet absolutely perfect. Far greater prominence is
   given to the unapproachable majesty and glory of God, than to His mercy
   and condescension: the full impress of His holy love is yet wanting;
   and hence that which is enjoined with respect to human sanctification
   and holiness still bears rather a preceptive, legal, and ceremonial
   character, than one truly spiritual, mental, and moral. It is only
   where the prototype of holy love is seen in God, and where man has
   become an image of that love, both in the relation he occupies towards
   God, and in his desires and external conduct, that holiness, in the
   full meaning of the term, is possible.

   And this we find in Christianity. Here first, and here only, do we meet
   with that perfect idea of holy love in which piety and morality are
   indivisibly united. Christianity, moreover, does not regard this idea
   as a standard exalted above ordinary practice, but cherishes the most
   assured confidence of its realization, even in the sphere of human
   life. Not till the appearance of Christianity did a community exist
   whose fundamental characteristic and aim were not any one particular
   virtue or religious exercise, but sanctification; and that a
   sanctification extending from the inmost heart to every circumstance of
   life,--an existence wholly in God and from God, as religious in its
   motives as it is moral in its activity. Whence, then, arose so
   deep-reaching, so wondrous a change? Was it effected merely in the way
   of reasoning and instructing? Such an issue would be contrary to all
   analogy. It could only have been brought about with the results which
   actually accompanied it in the way of life; in other words, by the
   appearance of a person who should make a profound impression that he
   possessed such holiness in unmistakeable perfection, and should thus
   set up an entirely new standard of excellence within this sphere of
   life. It was precisely in this manner also that the type of truly
   classic excellence was introduced into the province of art. This was
   not effected by devising beforehand some theory of beauty, but by its
   actual exhibition in the creations of some more than usually gifted
   artist.

   We have now, however, reached a point which will give rise to a special
   discussion. For it might be said: Granting that what has been hitherto
   advanced is correct, is it certain that the reality of a sinless life
   is needful to account for it? Might not the mere idea, the mere belief
   in such a life, produce the like effects? To this subject, then, we
   shall now devote a few words.

   Sec. 3.--These Effects caused not by an Idea, but by an Actual Person.

   The objection just hinted at is founded upon a spiritualism which
   everywhere flees from reality to dwell apart in a world of ideas, and
   seeks to resolve all life into mere intellectual conceptions. In fact,
   however, mere ideas have not the power of creating new life reality can
   only arise from reality and unless we are willing to regard the whole
   moral and religious life of the Christian world as a collection of mere
   ideas, instead of acknowledging it to be a reality, confirmed as such
   by our own experience, we must admit a corresponding reality as its
   starting-point, since there can be nothing in the effect whose germ was
   not previously in the cause.

   But here the question specially arises: Whence came, then, the
   representation, or, if the term be preferred, the idea of sinless
   perfection? In all other cases, being and life are primitive,
   representation and conception derived. Yet here a notion is supposed to
   precede, which would not only have no foundation in an originating
   life, but to which there would nowhere exist a corresponding reality.
   And how is it to be accounted for that this thought should have
   appeared, with so marked a character and so powerful an energy, just at
   this point of the world's history, while we find nothing similar or
   equal to it at any other period, nor at the same period in any other
   instance?

   We have already alluded to the fact that the notion of sinlessness had
   by no means attained so definite a form that nothing else remained to
   be done but to apply it to Jesus Christ, but that, on the contrary, the
   idea itself was first developed with and by the appearance of Jesus
   Himself. We have now arrived at the place where it will be needful to
   investigate this more closely. It is a fact of no slight significance.
   For if, on the one hand, we find that, previous to the appearance of
   Christ, and beyond the circle of Christian influences, the notion of
   sinlessness was either utterly indefinite, or, where it did occur, was
   inseparably connected with the certainty that its realization was
   impossible; while, on the other hand, we see that within the province
   of Christianity not only is the notion itself fully defined, but also
   accompanied by a firm faith in its actual realization in the life of a
   certain individual,--the conclusion forced upon us is, that between the
   former and latter state of things there must lie something by which
   this mighty change has been effected. Thus, again, the only natural
   explanation is offered by the supposition that the idea of sinlessness
   was realized in the Person of Jesus Christ.

   But it is not enough to have made this general statement. It must be
   historically proved; and for this purpose it will be needful to enter
   somewhat into particulars.

   The reason why the idea of pure holiness was impossible to the whole
   heathen world, lay, as has been already hinted, not only in the fact
   that polytheism was deficient in a spirit of thoroughly decided
   morality, but also in the positively immoral elements by which it was
   disfigured. For where the Divine models themselves were not regarded as
   pure, there could be no place for the notion of a virtue, spotless and
   in all respects perfect, within the province of human life.
   Nevertheless, even the heathen world possessed, in the form of
   philosophy and poetry, an extensive range of thought, which rose far
   above the limits of the popular religion; and in these departments we
   undoubtedly meet with very exalted views of morality. The tragic poets,
   especially Sophocles, present us with pictures of a virtue as sublime
   as it is pious and attractive; and those philosophers whose systems are
   borne up by a spirit of morality, naturally approach somewhat to the
   idea of a perfection of moral life in holiness,--because it is scarcely
   possible to go at all deep into the philosophy of moral subjects,
   without at least verging upon this idea. None of the sages of antiquity
   is more noteworthy in this respect than Plato. In the second book of
   his Republic he draws a sketch of a righteous man, in which he
   represents perfect integrity as necessarily conjoined with suffering.
   This must remind every thoughtful reader of the noblest instance of
   suffering virtue that we know of, and be regarded as one of the most
   remarkable anticipations of Christianity to be found among the deep
   utterances of that prophetic spirit. [120] In opposition to the
   unrighteous man, who, however, disguises himself in the garb of
   integrity, in order the better to carry out his ill designs, Plato
   places the simple and truly upright man,--the man who desires not to
   appear, but to be good, and who, in order that righteousness, and the
   love of righteousness, may appear in full purity, does not even appear
   as a righteous man, but is made to suffer as an evil-doer. This
   righteous man is thus described: [121] Without having done any
   unrighteousness, he still wears the appearance of being unrighteous, in
   order that he may be thoroughly proved to be righteous, inasmuch as he
   is not shaken in his integrity by the slander and other ills that
   thence arise, but remains stedfast' and constant even to death, having
   all his life been regarded as unrighteous, though in truth righteous.'
   Then with regard to his end he receives the following prediction That
   he will be bound, scourged, tortured, and blinded, and that after he
   has endured all possible evils, he will at last be hanged.' Now it is
   very certain that we have here presented to us the picture of a high
   and noble virtue and, what is especially worthy of note, it is virtue
   unobtrusive and suffering, virtue in the form of a servant. But, seen
   from the Christian point of view, two things are wanting. In the first
   place, the idea of virtue given here is entirely restricted to
   uprightness no reference is made to that inward religiousness by which
   virtue rises into holiness. Secondly,--and this is the main point,--all
   this is only a creation of the mind, while, on the other hand, we have
   no certainty that a righteousness, thus perfect in every respect, was
   ever actually realized in human life.

   It is remarkable that one who lived at a period when he could survey
   the whole development of the ancient world, should expressly declare,
   as Cicero does, that he at least had never found a perfectly wise man:'
   on the contrary, he says the philosophers are all at variance as to
   what kind of a man such a one would be, if ever he might be expected to
   exist.' [122] Cicero had a sufficient knowledge both of ethics and
   history to qualify him for pasting such a sentence, and we may well
   regard his opinion as expressing the consciousness of the educated
   portion of the ancient world. In fact there did not exist in the sphere
   of heathenism an individual with whom the idea of moral faultlessness
   could be associated. If in any case we could conceive this possible, it
   would be in that of Socrates. But though we possess truly glorious
   descriptions of this great man by two revering disciples, yet neither
   have they, nor has any one else, asserted that he was absolutely free
   from moral failings, and in all respects perfect. [123] On the
   contrary, we find that, strictly speaking, the prevalent conviction of
   the heathen world was, that moral perfection and faultlessness were
   impossible to man. This is most expressly asserted in the words of one
   who, equally with Cicero, may be regarded as fitted to he the spokesman
   of heathen antiquity, and whose high moral culture is acknowledged: we
   mean Epictetus. In his writings decided prominence is given to the
   notion of moral faultlessness; but to the question, Is it possible to
   be faultless? he unhesitatingly answers, No, it is impossible; the only
   thing possible is to be ever striving to be faultless.' [124]

   Such is the state of affairs with regard to the question which now
   occupies us, in the intellectual high places of the heathen world.
   [125] With more probability might we assume the presence of the idea of
   sinless holiness in the monotheistic religions than in paganism. For
   here, in virtue of the unity and spiritual nature of God, there
   naturally exists a clearer impression of the idea of holiness. The Old
   Testament contains even the hope--at least in prophetic allusion that
   the Messiah was to be a perfectly holy servant of Jehovah. [126] Yet
   neither of the monotheistic law-religions,--neither the Mosaic
   preparatory to Christianity, nor the Mohammedan, which, in spite of its
   partial imitation of the Christian religion, was but an apostasy
   therefrom,--offers anything like a full representation of the idea of
   sinless holiness: much less is there implied in either of them a belief
   in the realization of that idea in any human being. If this thought is
   to be found in these. religions, it would be to their founders that we
   must chiefly look for it; but neither Moses nor Mohammed--between whom,
   as is obvious, we make a comparison under this point of view
   alone--lays claim to freedom from sin: they never even rose to this
   conception; nor did the adherents of their faith ever honour them as
   sinless beings. [127] With regard to Mohammed, the Koran makes no
   secret of the fact that he was guilty of failings, and he himself makes
   an admonition go forth from God commanding him to pray for the
   forgiveness of his sins: many reputed prayers of his have, moreover,
   been preserved in the traditions of his followers, in which he complies
   with this injunction. [128] But besides this, in the case both of the
   founder of Islam and the lawgiver of the Old dispensation, not only
   their lives, but even the character of their religious institutions,
   and their entire ministries, would have belied the predicate of
   sinlessness. Both of them, though in very different ways, were founders
   of states and leaders of armies, and, by these very circumstances, too
   much addicted to the use of external means to be able to maintain that
   purity of thought and action of which he alone is capable who,
   confining himself entirely to those interests which lie within the
   province of religion, uses none but spiritual weapons against every,
   even the most unjust, attack. Moreover, the doctrine and institutions
   of both are based only on law, and perfect holiness belongs to a higher
   sphere than that of law. It can exist only when the legal stage has
   been surmounted, and the obedience of faith and love has superseded
   obedience to law,--when there is no longer any need of an external law,
   because the law is written in the heart. [129]

   This is, then, historically the state of the case: In the ages before
   Christ, no definite notion of sinless perfection, and where a shadow of
   the idea is found, an accompanying certainty of the impossibility of
   realizing it: since the appearance of Christ, not only the idea itself
   in full distinctness, but also the assured certainty of its
   achievement. On the one side there is a Plato, who describes the
   righteous man as great and glorious indeed, but still as only an ideal
   picture without reality; a Cicero, who calls in question the
   possibility of the realization of perfect wisdom; an Epictetus, who has
   a clearer idea of what sinlessness means, but is at the same time
   convinced of the impossibility of its ever being carried out in actual
   life. On the same side stand the founder of the Old Testament
   dispensation, who himself lays no claim to the possession of spotless
   righteousness, nor is regarded by his followers as perfectly sinless;
   the greatest prophet of the ante-Christian age, who had indeed an
   anticipation that the idea of holy purity would be realized, but. not
   till a future time, when it should be seen in the servant of God; and,
   lastly, the founder of Islam, who himself confessed his moral
   defalcations, and who lives in the traditions of his followers as one
   who owned his faults and prayed for their forgiveness. On the other
   side there are the plain, simple-minded apostles, themselves reckoned
   neither among the poets nor the philosophers, in whom we find not only
   the idea of sinless holiness most clearly defined, but in whom also
   faith in its actual realization in the person of Jesus became a power,
   strong enough to conquer the world and death; and by whom was given a
   description of the pure and holy life of Jesus, which called forth the
   same faith in others also, and which must, to this very day, be
   regarded as an inimitable picture of religious and moral perfection.

   What conclusion shall we then draw from this state of things? Shall we
   conclude that the apostles--like the God of Plato, who, contemplating
   ideas, proceeded to fashion the world--by only viewing the idea of
   perfection and holiness, sketched from their own internal resources the
   portrait of Jesus, and filled up the details of His life from their own
   poetic fancy? But then we must first show that that which they are
   supposed to have thus contemplated, had for them a real existence; and
   we have just seen that the opposite was the case. We must first make it
   appear credible that sober-minded men would have had such faith in a
   production of their own imagination (which they took for something
   real), as to sacrifice for its sake all that men usually hold dear: and
   in this there is a manifest contradiction. No! it would be far simpler,
   and far more consistent with history, to conclude that if an idea arose
   in all its clearness in the minds of the apostles, which the great
   thinkers and poets of antiquity were either utterly ignorant of, or saw
   but dimly, this can be accounted for only by the manifestation of a
   real life; and if an all-conquering belief in the reality of a sinless
   life was produced in their minds, while hitherto such a life had been
   esteemed impossible, the cause could only lie in the overpowering
   impression produced by that life itself, as seen unfolding before their
   eyes.

   We shall, however, draw this conclusion with greater confidence, in
   proportion as this view is found to be in other respects consistent
   with the nature of the case. For if the idea of sinless perfection does
   indeed belong, of its very nature, to the human mind, and form the
   foundation of its whole moral development yet, according to the laws of
   moral life, there can be no clear, full, and living consciousness of
   it, and consequently no belief in its realization, so long as sin is
   the ruling power in humanity. Hence, when the idea has become lucid and
   lifegiving, and when along with it there is the firm conviction of its
   realization, we are entitled to draw the conclusion that this has taken
   place as the result of an actual conquest of sin, and a real
   manifestation of a holy and perfect life. We say then: it is not
   possible to think otherwise than that He who called forth in His
   contemporaries, and through them in the Christian world, a belief
   strong, stedfast, and capable of transforming their whole life, in an
   altogether pure and holy virtue, was Himself in very deed a perfectly
   pure and holy Being.

   We have, then--as a retrospect of what has been advanced will show--a
   series of facts which mutually confirm each other. The moral greatness
   of Christ is confirmed, in a general point of view, by that judicial
   and dividing effect which His appearance everywhere produced, as well
   as by the relation in which men of the most opposite dispositions stood
   towards Him:--His enemies, with their deadly hatred; the seemingly
   impartial, who could not, however, withdraw themselves from the
   influence of His spiritual power the traitor, who, in his despair,
   passed sentence upon himself and the friends, whose love and reverence
   endured even unto death. But more definite confirmation of the sinless
   perfection of the Lord Jesus is offered by the testimony of the
   apostolic circle,--a testimony contained partly in direct assertions,
   and partly in that life-portrait of Christ which forms their commentary
   and confirmation. Beyond and above all this, however, is the sublime
   self-testimony from the lips of Jesus Himself, which leaves us in no
   doubt of what was His own consciousness with respect to His moral
   character, and the, relation to God and to the human race resulting
   therefrom. This, too, does not stand alone, but is supported and
   corroborated by the world-wide effects produced by Him in the sphere of
   religion and morality,--effects so entirely unique that no adequate
   explanation of them can be found, unless we allow that the
   self-testimony of Christ, and its echo in the evidence furnished by the
   apostles, is indeed corroborated by facts.

   Surely all these circumstances, taken together, furnish ample security
   for the sinless perfection of Christ. Nevertheless, when the question
   is to convert the assent of the understanding into the lively
   conviction of the individual, there is yet another kind of testimony to
   adduce. And this is the individual experience which each man may and
   ought to make by a direct application to the original sources,--to
   those Gospels, whose simple, powerful, and lively portraiture can be
   replaced by nothing else. If this is done in a candid and unprejudiced
   spirit, the image of the Lord Jesus will be vividly presented to his
   mind and this image will not only fill his whole soul with admiration,
   as some production of poetry or rhetoric might do, but will act as a
   moral power upon his heart, and thus take possession of his whole inner
   man. He will feel that he has here found that which elevates him above
   all that is low, earthly, and common, which directly purifies him, and
   penetrates him with the feeling of the Divine nearness. He will be
   constrained to say that, if he desires to be really in harmony with
   such a manifestation, he must become a radically new man and, on
   further consideration, he will be persuaded that there is no other
   moral phenomenon on earth which produces like effects, and therefore
   none which thus points to a higher order of things, and to an origin
   beyond ordinary human experience, even an origin which is Divine. [130]

   In this sense we must say that it is the motel portraiture of the Lord
   Jesus which, in virtue of the vital power inherent in it itself, offers
   the best and strongest evidence of its truth and uniqueness. As the
   poet, [131] in reply to the question, Whence the sun's celestial fires
   are derived? answers, That which enlightens the world enlightens
   itself: its light bears witness that its origin is light,--so may the
   same be said of the portraiture of Him who is the light of the moral
   world--the Sun of righteousness.' He who beholds the light of the sun
   and feels the warmth of its rays, will have no doubts of its existence,
   nor of the power of its agency. So, too, he who has once felt in his
   own heart the peculiar power exercised by the Gospel delineation of the
   Lord Jesus, will entertain no kind of doubt as to its reality and
   origin.

   129. Compare on the passage, Baur in his Apollonius von Tyana u.
   Christus, S. 163-166.

   [122] In the well-known passage of the Second Book of the Tusculan
   Disputations, where he speaks of triumphing over pain, and says that
   the pars inferior, the molle, demissum, humile in man, should be
   governed by the domina omnium et regina ratio. Here he says, ii. 22: In
   quo erit perfecta sapientia--quem adhuc nos quidem vidimus nominem: sed
   philosophorum sententiis, qualis futuris sit, si modo aliquando fuerit
   exponitur--is igitur, sive ea ratio quæ erit in eo perfecta et
   absoluta, sic illi parti imperabit inferiori, ut justus parens probis
   filiis. Here, indeed, only one aspect of morality, the victory over
   pain, is spoken of; but if even in this one respect, which was the very
   point in which antiquity, and especially heroic Rome, excelled, Cicero
   doubted whether a perfectly wise man had ever appeared, how much more
   would he have done so if the realization of a virtue absolutely pure iu
   every respect had been in question!

   [123] The only passage which could be brought forward in support of an
   opposite assertion is in Xenophon's Memorabilia, lib. i. cap. i. § 11:
   Oudei`s de` po'pote Sokra'tous oude`n asebe`s oude` ano'sion ou'te
   pra'ttontos eiden, ou'te le'gontos e'kousen. It is evident, however,
   from the whole tenor of this defence, and especially from the
   immediately preceding context, that it is more legality, and especially
   the legality of his public dealings and discourses, which is here
   intended, than morality in its higher signification. But granting that
   the words are to be understood as applied to morality in the widest
   sense, even then the main point is wanting, viz. the testimony of
   Socrates himself. This, however, is indispensable, since he alone was
   capable of a thorough survey of himself. We shall, however, do no
   injustice to Socrates by assuming that he would not have applied to
   himself that great saying of the Redeemer, Which of you convinceth me
   of sin?' In the very fact that the demons of Socrates chiefly warned
   him against things which he was not to do, while Christ positively
   acted in all things from a pure consciousness of God within, from that
   Divine Spirit by which He was impelled, lies a most important
   distinction between the philosopher and the Saviour. It is not to be
   denied that the picture of a perfectly wise man, not merely as an idea,
   but as a reality, is presented to us even within the sphere of
   heathenism by Philostratus, in his Life of Apollonius of Tyana; but in
   this case there is a reference to Christianity, and the whole life is
   but an imitation of that of Christ, translated into Platonism and
   Pythagoreanism. This is convincingly proved by Baur, in his work,
   Apollonius of Tyana and Christ, or the Relation of Pythagoreanism to
   Christianity, Tübingen 1632, in which (p. 162) the result of his
   researches, as far as our present subject is concerned, is thus
   expressed: In the place of Him whom Christianity sets before us as the
   actually manifested Redeemer of the world, we have here a sage acting
   only by precept and example he is, moreover--and this must be the main
   point--no living form, but an image wanting independent reality and
   actual existence,--a faint and shadowy reflection of a living original,
   but for whom it is evident that even the creative idea which called it
   forth would be absent.'

   [124] The words of Epictetus, iv. 12, 19th ed. Schweigh., are: Ti' oun;
   dunato`n anama'rteton einai e'de; Ame'chanon; all' ekeino dunato`n
   pro`s to` me` amarta'nein teta'stha dienekos. In an epigram in
   Demosthenes, de Corona, p. 322, the quality of doing all that is right
   is attributed to the gods alone.

   [125] Since the notion, and the word which defines it, assume each the
   other, it may not be amiss to offer a few remarks upon the expressions
   anamartesia and anamartetos. These undoubtedly occur at a very early
   period in the language of classical antiquity, but at first they are
   for the most part applied only to external relations; and even when in
   later times used with reference to moral actions, they lack that full
   significance which Christian thought attributes to them. In Herodotus
   anamartetos is applied, v. 39, to a woman who had not sinned against
   her husband, and, i. 55, to a city which had incurred no debts. In
   Xenophon and Plato anamartetos is sometimes one who cannot err,
   sometimes one who has not actually erred; but in both instances it is
   used in no higher sense than as referring to the external affairs of
   life. In the first of these two meanings, Plato says, de Repub. lib. 1,
   Po'teron de` anama'rtetoi' eisin oi a'rchontes, e` oioi' te kai`
   amarta'nein; in the other, Xenophon, Horo ga`r ton anthro'pon oude'na
   anama'rteton diatelounta. Longinus, de Sublim. xxxi. 8, uses the word
   in the same sense as katharos and asphales, to denote the pure and the
   classical in style, and distinguishes in this respect between that
   which is merely free from faults, and that which is the work of genius
   (de Sublim. xxxiii. 2). It is in Diogenes Laertius (vii. 122) and
   Epictetus that it occurs with the most decided moral meaning. In the
   latter are found a whole series of passages in which the word
   occurs:--e.g. i. 4, 11: En ormais kai` aphormais anama'rtetos; iv. 8,
   6: e tou philoso'phou pro'lepsis kai` epangeli'a, anama'rteton einai;
   and especially the above-mentioned remarkable passage, iv. 12, 19.
   Hamartesia also occurs, though less frequently, with the same various
   meanings. Compare Stephan. Thesaur. Ling. Gr. vol. ii. p. 1920, ed.
   Lond.

   [126] Isa. liii. 9.

   [127] The prerogative of sinlessness has never been laid claim to on
   behalf of Moses. The inadmissibility of such a notion would at once
   have been shown by a reference to Ex. ii. 12 and 14. Much less can
   sinlessness be predicated of Mohammed. On this point the reader is
   referred to the Contributions to a Theology of the Koran, by OEttinger
   (Tübinger Zeitschrift für Theologie, Jahrgang 1831, No. iii. pp. 62,
   63), where we find the following observations: Nowhere in the Koran do
   we find the idea of sinlessness applied to a human being. Reference
   might indeed here be made to the passage (12, 53) where Joseph says, "I
   will not acquit myself of guilt, for every soul inclineth to evil, save
   him on whom God has compassion." But it is evident that this expression
   means no more than that every man will sin unless God's mercy hold him
   up, which by no means implies that any one may be wholly free from sin.
   The Koran, in general, regards sin more as an outward than an inward
   occurrence, while even the prophetic vocation does not necessarily
   involve a perfect freedom from external and manifest transgression;
   though Mohammed, when his conscience accuses him, or even when men
   reproach him for his sins, earnestly endeavours to weaken the force of
   such reproaches by supposed Divine revelations.' Still more decidedly
   is this point argued by Gerock (Christologie des Koran, Hamb. 1839, pp.
   100, 101). It is there shown that in the Koran Jesus is indeed held up
   to imitation as a moral ensample, but necessarily without the predicate
   of sinlessness, since even Mohammed, who is greater than He, confesses
   to the commission of mistakes and precipitate actions. In one passage
   God says to Mohammed (Sur. 48, B. 1 and 2): We have granted thee a
   decisive victory, in order that Allah may forgive thee thy sins both
   past and future.' Again (Sur. 40, B. 57), Mohammed is reminded: Pray
   for the forgiveness of thy sins.' (So also p. 80, v. 1 seq.; p. 4, v.
   104).

OBJECTIONS.
     __________________________________________________________________

   AS we have before remarked, a mathematical or logically
   incontrovertible certainty is, with respect to our subject, impossible.
   Hence no proofs can be adduced which will absolutely exclude all
   doubts. Nor are doubts by any means lacking; for while many modern
   theologians have merely taken up a sceptical position with regard to
   sinlessness, there are others who have stated reasons which are
   sufficiently plausible to make a discussion of them needful. Such a
   discussion we are the more inclined to enter upon in the following
   pages, because the questions hence arising have not as yet been treated
   in the full and connected manner which the subject demands. [132]

   The objections which have been raised may, in a general way, be classed
   as follows:--One class rests on a denial of the actual sinlessness of
   Jesus; the other on a denial of the possibility of sinlessness at all
   in the sphere of human life. In the former case the sinlessness of
   Jesus is impugned, partly on the ground of its being inconsistent with
   that law of development which is applied to Him in reference both to
   His character and His work; partly as at variance with the idea of
   temptation and partly on the ground of distinct utterances and facts
   recorded of Him.. In the second case, the objections to the sinlessness
   of Jesus are drawn, on the one hand, from experience on the other, from
   the very nature of the idea of sinlessness and the mode of its
   realization. These last objections are therefore partly empirical, and
   partly speculative, in their nature.

   Adopting this classification, we shall proceed from that which is
   special to that which is general,--from that which is less important to
   that which is more so. That doubt is of less moment, and does not
   directly assail the character of Jesus, which hints that if He passed
   through a development at all, He must have begun in imperfection, and
   have risen gradually to perfection. We shall find it harder to
   reconcile with our idea of sinlessness, the notion that Jesus could
   have felt inwardly drawn towards evil when exposed to temptation while
   the strongest objection of all would be a really immoral utterance or
   deed. But, even supposing all that might be urged under these heads
   were answered, this would be of no avail, if it could be proved that
   sinless perfection is altogether impossible in the region of human
   existence, if experience or the nature of the moral idea witnessed
   unanswerably against its realization in a human being.

   These are the difficulties which meet us here. In endeavouring to
   surmount them in the order above given, we shall of course labour to
   keep duly separate that which is essentially distinct but since
   objections of both kinds glide to a certain degree into each other,
   many difficulties must needs be touched upon in the first part, the
   more complete solution of which must be reserved to the second.

CHAPTER I.

  ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE ACTUAL SINLESSNESS OF JESUS.

   IF we pass by altogether, in the first instance, the question as to
   whether or not sinlessness be possible in humanity, and, assuming for
   the time its possibility, ask only, Was Jesus actually sinless? then
   our business is with facts; and these, if they are questionable, would
   be in the first instance most efficiently contested, if other
   indubitable and contrary facts could be opposed to them. It has been
   supposed that such facts are to be found in certain parts of the Gospel
   narratives. And in this respect attention has first of all been called
   to the development which took place in the life of Jesus, and therefore
   to a progress from a state of imperfection to one of perfection, by
   which, it is urged, the idea of absolute perfection is excluded. This
   has been made use of in two ways,--in relation, first, to the Person of
   Jesus, and secondly, to the Messianic plan. We must examine both
   aspects of this argument more closely.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sec. 1.--The Development of the Person of Jesus.

   The Scriptures speak undeniably of a growth in wisdom in Jesus,
   consequently of an increase, a progress in His intellectual life; and
   not less distinctly do they intimate that His moral nature became
   gradually perfect. And were this not clearly taught in single passages,
   [133] it would naturally follow, from the view everywhere taken in the
   New Testament, that the entire life of Jesus was an actual human life,
   shorn of no quality or power proper to man. But if Jesus did advance
   intellectually and grow in moral perfection, this, it is said, involves
   a defective beginning, and thus excludes original and symmetrical
   perfection.

   To this we reply: Certainly the gradualness, the successive character,
   of the development of Jesus, must be maintained. But growth and
   increase do not necessarily assume transition from a state of
   deficiency to one of sufficiency,--do not presuppose an inner
   antagonism of sin, or an overcoming of the religious and moral error
   connected therewith. All that they really imply is, development taking
   place in time. There is nothing to hinder this development itself from
   being a perfectly pure one. The notion of growth does but furnish
   another proof that Jesus shared in everything that really belongs to
   finite, human nature. This is, however, as little denied by any, as it
   can, on the other side, be proved that mere human development, as such,
   necessarily involves some amount of sin. In itself it may be conceived
   of as a perfectly normal development, in which indeed different degrees
   succeed each other, each free from actual disturbance, each exhibiting
   in greater maturity some quality which was but prepared for in former
   stages, but which yet existed potentially from the very beginning.
   [134]

   That this was so in the case of the Lord Jesus, cannot indeed be
   positively demonstrated, throughout the whole course of His life; but
   still less can the contrary be proved. Nay more, not only are we
   justified in inferring from the subsequent perfection of Jesus, that
   the manner in which it was attained was in general normal, but we have
   also a particular fact corroborating this conclusion, and making it
   evident to the mind. The fact referred to is, of course, that most
   significant resting-place afforded us by the narrative of His visit to
   Jerusalem during His twelfth year. [135] We find, even at this early
   age, that which ever formed the centre of His being, even the
   consciousness of an entirely unique relation to God; and yet this is at
   the same time expressed in a manner perfectly appropriate to His
   youthful years. This narrative is a type of His whole development; it
   represents His ideality in a childlike form, and therefore the ideality
   of childhood in genera1. [136]

   This thought of a perfectly normal development does not by any means
   bring us within the regions of the magical and docetical, but rather
   expresses the restoration of human nature to its integrity,--nature in
   its primal purity and holiness; for an orderly, faultless development
   is proper to nature when interfered with by no inward or outward
   restraint. Nature, in its Divine origin, is purity itself. We should be
   on our guard, therefore, against introducing anything unnatural into
   the intellectual condition of Jesus, by representing Him as a
   precocious child, and ascribing to Him as a boy the knowledge of truth,
   the moral earnestness and the depth of a man. Such a condition would
   not be a miracle worthy of God, but an unnatural monstrosity. [137] At
   every period of His existence He realized just that measure of
   intellectual culture and moral life of which human nature is at that
   point capable, without ceasing to be human nature. In a word, He was
   exactly and fully what a man can be at each successive step of his
   life. As He was a perfect man, so was He also a perfect boy and youth,
   and of a certainty no stranger to the modes of thought and observation
   which are peculiar to childhood and youth; yet all was characterized by
   a holy simplicity and beauty. His progress was like that of a beautiful
   flower, to whose free growth there is no hindrance, and of which we
   should never require that whilst in the germ it should bud, and whilst
   budding, possess the glory of perfect bloom; but only that at each step
   in its development it should be in every respect what it then ought to
   be. [138]

   As little ought we absolutely to deny the existence of what was
   individual and national in the education of Jesus, and the influence
   thereon of external circumstances. Everything human is subject to
   influences of this nature. And as those whom we rightly call men of
   genius are not essentially moulded and determined by that which comes
   to them from without, but possess the power to employ it for the most
   part as a means to their own development, and to the manifestation of
   that which is in them by nature, we may surely conceive of a mind of
   which this holds true in so eminent and unqualified a manner, that
   everything tendered by outward conditions is simply and only the means
   and material of self-development,--a mind which, in the perfectly
   independent course of its development, appropriates nothing narrow and
   unworthy, but only the good and the salutary of all that its external
   circumstances present. [139] We do not deny that there was in the
   religious faith of the nation to which He belonged, and in the
   character of the family and surroundings amidst which He grew up, much
   which might naturally exercise either a salutary or restraining
   influence upon Him. The sacred types and teachings of the Old Testament
   were certainly as little lost upon Him, as the impression made by all
   that met His eyes, whether in nature, or among His fellow-men. But who
   would attempt to bring these forward as offering a sufficient
   explanation of the peculiarity of His whole mental life? In the case of
   other distinguished personages, the elements from which their
   characters were developed may be, as a rule, to a great degree at
   least, pointed out. But who is there who still conceives the notion of
   deriving Christianity from Essenism, or from Egyptian priest-lore, or
   of making Jesus Christ the happy medium between Pharisaism and
   Saduceeism? Or who could imagine that He had made an Abraham, a Moses,
   an Elijah, or any other Old Testament character His model? No; if ever
   there was, in the intellectual and moral realm, an original, a
   creative, a primitive phenomenon, it was the character of Jesus Christ.
   [140] His development did indeed take place in a course of most lively
   reciprocity of action with the world, [141] but not in any dependence
   upon it; while aught of imitation cannot even be thought of. Together,
   however, with this extreme originality, is found that universal
   character which makes Him a model for the whole human race; and these
   united characteristics offer, at the same time, most valid security
   that His development was of a healthy and normal nature, because,
   while, apart from all disturbing influences, it resulted, in all that
   was essential, wholly from within, it was yet such as to place Him on a
   height on which He appears as the unsurpassed model of all future ages.

   What has hitherto been advanced, tends of course merely to make plain
   the possibility of conceiving in Jesus a perfectly pure development.
   But at present this is all we need, inasmuch as our only aim at this
   point is to show that development does not of itself involve sin. The
   positive certainty that the development of Jesus was sinless, must be
   sought in another direction,--namely, by proving that it is an
   indispensable presupposition, if the actual condition and character of
   Jesus at a subsequent period is to be satisfactorily explained, and not
   to seem utterly out of connection with His earlier life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [133] For the intellectual growth of Jesus we have the classic words,
   proekopte sophia, Luke ii. 52: for His growth in moral perfection there
   are several passages in the Epistle to the Hebrews, especially chap.
   ii. 10-18, v. 7-9. Compare Scholten, Oratio de vitando in Jesu Christi
   historia Docetismo, pp. 15-19; De Wette, Das Wesen des christlichen
   Glaubens, § 53, p. 269; and Riehm, Lehrbegr. des Hebräerbriefs, i. pp.
   327, etc. Keim especially has endeavoured to bring forward the several
   stages of the human development of Jesus' in his lecture under this
   title. His remarks are frequently striking, but there are also many
   points with which we are unable to agree. Also Gess, in another, and
   decidedly positive sense, in his Lehre von der Person Christi: see many
   passages, but especially p. 210, and pp. 304 seq.

   [134] The idea of development does not of itself involve the passing
   through antagonisms and conflicts, or, that at every step in advance
   the hindrances universally presented by evil have to be surmounted, and
   some one of its disturbing elements to be reduced to inactivity.' This
   is only true of the development of individuals, and of mankind, when
   evil has already gained power over them, i.e. when they are, morally
   considered, in an unnatural condition. But only a slavish dependence on
   a narrow empiricism, whose inductions will not even bear application to
   the sphere of nature, can. lead us to represent the present form of
   human development as its natural and necessary one. That would be a
   true development in which nothing should ever be lost at a higher which
   had been once really possessed at a lower stage; and simply on the
   ground that there was nothing which it were needful and good to lose,
   simply because at no point was there anything which tended to interfere
   with or thwart the vocation of the being whose development was going
   forward.' See Jul. Müller's Christian Doctrine of Sin, vol. i. pp.
   80-86 of third ed. Besides, that which specially characterizes the
   notion of moral development is not its negative side, viz. the conquest
   of evil, but positive growth in good; and it is just in this latter
   sense that it is applied to Jesus.

   [135] Luke ii. 41-51.

   [136] Lange, Leben Jesu, vol. ii. p. 127.

   [137] There is not a trace of such monstrosities as these in the sober
   narrative of the canonical Gospels, while, as is well known, they are
   to be found in the apocryphal histories of Jesus. See my work,
   Historisch oder Mythisch? § 4.

   [138] The fundamental thought of all this was expressed even by remelts
   in the well-known passage, adv. hæres. ii. 22, where, among other
   things, it is said: ldeo (Christus) per omnem venit ætatem et
   infantibus infans factus, sanctificans infantes; in parvulis parvulus,
   sanctificans hanc ipsam habentes ætatem; in juvenibus juvenis, etc.
   Among modern writers it will be found in Schleiermacher, Glaubenslehre,
   ii. 178, and Olahausen, Bibl. Comment. i. 134.

   Sec. 2.--The Development of the Messianic Plan.

   With still more positiveness, and with greater force, has the objection
   which is based on progress from a state of imperfection to one of
   perfection, been urged in relation to the Messianic plan of Jesus.
   [142] Jesus, it has been represented, did not, at His first appearance,
   recognise clearly the aim of His life; His first true recognition of it
   was the result of a catastrophe affecting both. His inner and outer
   life. It is allowed that, from the very beginning, the fundamental
   feature of His plan was the formation of mankind into a community by
   means of religious love; but it is contended that at first this was
   mingled with political views and tendencies, since He hoped, by the
   exaltation of Israel, to found a theocracy into which all nations
   should gradually be drawn. It was not till afterwards, when this notion
   came into conflict with the sense of the nation and its rulers, and was
   thereby frustrated, and its impracticability exposed, that there arose
   in the mind of Jesus, and that not without a struggle, the idea of a
   spiritual kingdom of God; and thus, we are told, it was that Jesus was
   transformed from a Jewish Messiah into the Redeemer of the world.

   This view, which even at a former period was broached by certain of the
   learned, has been fully and acutely carried out in more recent times.
   [143] It has been, indeed, substantially retracted by its most
   distinguished advocate; and yet it was again brought forward, though in
   a modified form, a short time since. [144] It is a view which, if
   established, would evidently be followed by important results; it would
   essentially affect that image of Jesus which Christendom has hitherto
   found in its Gospels and preserved in its faith; it would banish the
   idea of a perfectly wise and holy Redeemer, who by His spiritual
   greatness is able to free men from error and sin. Looked at in this
   light, we should not be able to feel that Jesus possessed even a high
   degree of insight, much less that He was perfect in intellectual
   strength. According to this hypothesis, He must not only in general
   have struggled through error to more correct knowledge, but even
   through such error as He might have avoided, had He carefully studied
   the condition of His people before commencing His work. Evidently, too,
   He had not well considered the whole compass of His plan; for what He
   would have done in opposition to the existing Roman authority and rule,
   when once possessed of the highest theocratic power, remains an
   unsolved, and by no means unimportant difficulty. He had not, in fine,
   that high, independent power of spirit which the moral Deliverer of
   humanity should and must have; for instead of fighting His way with a
   sure step through difficulties and hindrances, as one truly
   self-reliant would have done, it was the unfavourable turn which His
   affairs took that first brought Him to a right mind; and then, in place
   of joyfully and enthusiastically grasping the higher thought that
   dawned upon Him, He fell into sadness and dismay, as He looked back on
   His shattered hopes, and forward to a future in which there awaited Him
   a cross instead of a crown. [145] Such a Christ does not control, but
   is Himself controlled by circumstances; He does not distinctly and
   consciously propose to Himself His own aim, but has it gradually formed
   for, and forced upon Him, by events and accidents; He is not the Lord,
   but the creature of the times. If the veritable historical Christ were
   such a one as this, the Christian Church would scarcely be able to
   reverence in him the light and Saviour of the world; nor could He
   satisfy the requirements which we are compelled to make of the Redeemer
   of mankind. Such insight into the plan of Jesus as would be attained in
   this way, would be dearly bought: happily, however, the view presented
   above has no solid foundation in fact.

   The main support of the opinion that Jesus had at first a theocratic
   plan of the nature just indicated, is His appropriation to Himself of
   the character of Messiah; and the Messiah, according to the prophets,
   and still more in the view of His contemporaries, was to be not only a
   religious and moral, but also a political deliverer. It is urged: If
   Jesus did not mean to awaken political hopes, He would not have given
   Himself out for the Messiah; but inasmuch as He did call Himself the
   Messiah, the political element must evidently have entered into His
   plan. This conclusion can, however, only be drawn when certain of His
   utterances are isolated, and viewed apart from their connection with
   the whole of His teaching and works. Jesus did appropriate to Himself
   the idea of the Messiah as a true and eternal one; but in the
   consciousness of being Himself the promised One, He also glorified the
   idea by manifesting its high religious realization. In doing this He
   would have acted very injudiciously, if He had begun by theoretical
   discussions. His true course was rather first to realize in His own
   life the idea of the Messiah, and then to bring Himself forward as the
   promised One, under that aspect which He had thus rendered actual and
   evident. At the same time, however, from the very beginning Jesus
   declared in divers ways, that what He sought to found was a Divine
   kingdom of piety and love,--a union of mankind on the basis of a moral
   deliverance.

   When Jesus spoke of His kingdom, it was equivalent to speaking of His
   plan; and at no period of His life did He leave men in uncertainty as
   to the true nature of His kingdom. He ever proclaimed it to be heavenly
   and eternal,--to be one whose commencements are within, in the heart,
   and which is thence to be established visibly. This is clear even from
   the beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount: and these were undeniably
   amongst His earliest public utterances. All His parables, too, in which
   He gave expression to His view of the nature of the kingdom of God, are
   of the same purport. In them He taught, with special emphasis, that in
   its development the kingdom of God would he like the mustard seed, in
   its mode of operation like leaven: In perfect consistency with this,
   is. the position He assigned to John. the Baptist as the greatest among
   the prophets, but as, notwithstanding, less than the least in the
   economy of the new kingdom of God. [146] Not less in harmony with this
   representation was the whole character and tenor of His life,--and it
   was sublimely consistent throughout,--especially as depicted by John
   the beloved disciple. One whose object was to found a new social order
   on the ruins of the old, must have gone to work in an entirely
   different manner. For such a scheme there were undoubtedly abundant
   materials at hand in His own commanding spirit, and in the condition of
   the nation. But then something more than merely passing
   disturbances--disturbances which He Himself disdained--would have
   arisen, [147] and far more decided events would certainly have
   occurred. But so far removed was He from anything of this kind, that
   His inactivity would be inexplicable, were the supposition in question
   correct: His conduct, then, would have been not only without a plan,
   but contradictory, for no single measure can be pointed out in His
   course which can be regarded as having been distinctly adopted to
   further political ends. The nature of His operations is only
   intelligible on the assumption that, from the very commencement, He had
   in view the inward renewal of humanity. The same observation may be
   made with respect to His discourses. Where can we find in them a single
   utterance which decidedly announces an external theocracy? The words
   [148] in which He promised His. disciples a hundredfold recompense in
   the kingdom of the Son of Man, and which might possibly be made to bear
   such a meaning, lose even the appearance of a reference to an external
   theocracy, and receive their sole appropriate explanation as a
   symbolical representation of future glory, when compared with other
   passages in which Jesus sternly repels every ambitious view of His
   followers, teaches them rather to look forward to the most painful
   conflicts, and sets forth the love which is willing and content to
   serve, as the true sign and seal of dignity in the kingdom of God.

   Some have laboured to show that there is a contrast between the earlier
   and later utterances of Jesus, indicative of a change of feelings and
   views. This supposition is based on the fact, that whilst at His first
   public appearances [149] blessings fell from His lips, at a later
   period He poured forth denunciations against the cities which had
   rejected Him. [150] They have likewise inferred, from the manner in
   which He threatened the downfall of Jerusalem, [151] that originally it
   was His purpose to effect its political emancipation, and that He only
   renounced this design at a subsequent period. But there is no solid
   ground for such opinions. Not one of the blessings first pronounced by
   Jesus has remained in its true sense unfulfilled: as for the curses
   denounced against particular cities, they were the natural fruit of
   their unbelief. Jesus did desire, indeed, to lead Jerusalem and the
   Jewish commonwealth to an increased degree of civil prosperity, but
   only by means of a moral renewal; and for this His yearning was no less
   intense at the close than at the commencement of His career. [152] The
   only perceivable difference is, that as He drew towards the termination
   of His mission, the ardent love He bore to His people expressed itself
   more frequently and more strongly in the form of grief at their
   perversity, until, last of all, there burst forth the prophetic
   warning, that their contempt of inward moral redemption must inevitably
   result in outward ruin. [153] Here was the chief ground of the sadness
   of Jesus, which, although more obvious and perceptible at the close of
   His career, had pervaded His whole life. [154] His was, then, no
   faint-hearted depression and bitterness because of crushed hopes, but a
   much deeper pain. He was sad, partly on account of the degradation of
   His own countrymen, and partly because of the power of evil over
   mankind generally,--the evil which rose to its most fearful height when
   it caused His own death. His sadness had undoubtedly special regard to
   Jerusalem, not, however, because of any discovery He had made that it
   was past help of a political nature, but because His fellow-countrymen
   had now finally rejected that which would have given them true peace
   and deliverance. But it is even more specially asserted, as forming a
   part of the human development' of Jesus, that the notion of a suffering
   Messiah found no place in His mind at the beginning of His career, and
   did not arise till a certain definite period, when, as an entirely new
   stage of consciousness, it abolished that stage which had preceded it.
   [155] Let us see whether this was really the case.

   We do not dispute that the notion of suffering and of death did but
   gradually attain increased power and prominence in the mind of Jesus.
   In conformity with this, we find that it was not till an expressly
   stated occasion that He solemnly disclosed it to His followers; [156]
   and this is but consistent with the successive development which we
   have already admitted. On the other hand, we decidedly contend that it
   was no new notion, opposed to former ideas, first making its appearance
   during His public ministry. For such a one could not, be the result of
   mere development, but must rather be designated as a mighty
   revolution,--a total change in the views of Christ, necessarily
   involving a corresponding change of external conduct. Of this, if it
   had really taken place, we must have found evident traces, partly in
   the utterances of Jesus Himself, and partly in intimations by the
   apostles, whose perception such a state of things could not possibly
   have escaped. On the contrary, the exact reverse to this is found; of
   which fact we have ample confirmation from other quarters, without
   appealing to that somewhat obscure expression of the earlier days of
   His ministry concerning the destruction of the temple. [157]

   On the very threshold of Christ's public life, we meet with the history
   of the temptation; and it is impossible not to regard the rejection of
   an externally glorious Messiahship--a rejection antecedent to any act
   of His public ministry--as the very essence of this narrative. [158]
   And if this be so, what was left but to seek another kind of glory by
   the path of conflicts, suffering, and sacrifice? Jesus must indeed have
   had but little acquaintance either with His own nation and the Roman
   power,--with Pharisaism and the priesthood,--with Himself and the
   sinful world,--if He could not foresee, even by mere human prescience,
   an embittered contest, and at last a tragic issue. And how does He
   express Himself? The ideas of the self-denial, the sacrifice, the
   surrender of life, of losing it that it may be gained, of the dying of
   the corn of wheat that it may bring forth fruit, run like a red thread
   through all His discourses from first to last. He sends forth His
   apostles as sheep in the midst of wolves, announces to them calamities
   of every kind, and impresses upon their minds this one thing, that it
   is enough for the disciple to be as his Master. [159] Even in the
   Sermon on the Mount He predicts hatred and persecution for His name's
   sake, to all who should believe in Him; [160] He acknowledges as His
   true disciple only him who denies himself and takes up his cross; [161]
   and knows that His people will everywhere have, not power and
   authority, but service, subjection, patient endurance of wrong, to the
   very uttermost. Have we, indeed, in all this the image of an outwardly
   triumphant Messiah? Certainly not; but rather of one who would Himself
   take up the cross before all others, and precede them on the path of
   suffering, even to the very extremity of self-sacrifice. And that the
   Lord recognised Himself as the Messiah in this sense, is already shown
   by His own words, even at a very early period of His ministry, without
   appealing to the above-mentioned more obscure passage. [162]

   In this point, as well as with regard to the plan of Jesus, we cannot
   but hold fast the essential oneness of His views; and though we do
   admit a development, it is only such a one as by no means presupposes
   the existence of any internal discord in His mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [142] The phrase, Plan of Jesus,' has in recent times been so much in
   vogue, that it may seem paradoxical to consider it inappropriate; and
   yet it is utterly so. The devising of a plan implies an activity of
   mind which is far too strongly individual and subjective to be ascribed
   to Jesus. So also the acting constantly according to a plan, springs
   from a one-sided predominance of reflection, such as He never
   manifested. That which He was commissioned to do and to establish was
   marked out for Him by God and history,--was recognised, not devised by
   Him. Hence, although we are not warranted in saying that there was no
   connection between His various acts, seeing that in all He did and said
   He was possessed and inspired by the loftiest idea still, to assume
   that all He did was deliberately planned and intended beforehand, in
   the common sense of the words, reduces Him to a lower position than
   that which He actually occupied, as One filled with the Spirit and with
   God. The older terms, office and work of Christ, have much greater
   congruity than the modern expression plan. If, however, this term plan,
   having usage on its side, is to be retained, let us understand by it
   only, as Hase very correctly defines it in his Leben Jesu, § 40, His
   subjective conception of the office to which God had appointed Him,
   without reference to the collateral use of the word in the sense of:
   what is arbitrary, the mere result of reflection.' Compare Neander's
   Life of Jesus, pp. 128, etc., fifth ed.

   [143] Following in the steps of Von Ammon, De Wette, and some others,
   Hase, in the first ed. of his Leben Jesu, published at Leipsic in 1829,
   propounded at length the thought of a twofold plan of Jesus,--of a plan
   which was at first theocratical, and only became purely, religious
   subsequently. In opposition to his view and development of the subject,
   appeared Heubner, in an appendix to the fifth ed. of Reinhard's Plan
   Jesu, Wittenb. 1830, pp. 394-407; Lücke, in two programmes of the year
   1831, under the title, Examinatur, quæ speciosius nuper commendata est,
   sententia de mutato per eventa, adeoque sensim emendato Christi
   consilio; and J. E. Osiander, in his article, Ueber die neueren
   Bearbeitungen des Lebens Jesu von Paulus und Hase, in the Tübinger
   Zeitschrift für Theologie, 1831, No. i. pp. 145-148. My controversy
   also, in the second ed. of this work, was with Hase. To this
   opposition, especially as conducted by Lücke, Hase, with a noble love
   of truth, did justice, partly in his Theologische Streitschriften,
   Leipsic 1834, pp. 61-102, and partly in the subsequent editions of his
   Leben Jesu. He adopted from his antagonists as much as his own
   convictions would allow him, and sought to unite the opposed views in
   the following general result, § 50:--Apart from single political
   institutions, which are by nature transitory, the plait of Jesus
   undoubtedly related to a moral reformation and a spiritual kingdom; but
   still the Divine law which He put in force was clearly meant in the
   course of time to subdue the world, or rather to pervade it as its
   highest general law; and He, the King of Truth, intended to become also
   a King of the world.' Jesus must, at one time or other, have examined
   and rejected those Messianic hopes which bore a theocratic character,
   for the Messianic faith could only reach Him in that form. But there is
   no proof whatever that He was led to this examination and rejection by
   hard experience in the midst of His career, and not by the clear
   judgment of His own mind ere He entered on His work.'

   [144] Viz. by Keim in his work, Die menschliche Entwickelung Jesu, pp.
   28, etc. He advocates the view that it was not till a certain definite
   period of His public ministry that the perception that the Messiah was
   to be a sufferer arose upon the mind of Jesus, and that it was at the
   same time that His idea of a Messianic kingdom, which was to be in the
   first place a Jewish one, expanded into that of a universal spiritual
   kingdom.

   Sec. 3.--The Temptation.

   The very difficult problem now awaits our consideration, whether Jesus
   ever experienced any inclination to sin? Our business is specially with
   the application of the idea of temptation to Jesus, and the difficulty
   lies in the question as to whether He could be really tempted, and yet
   remain absolutely sinless. Temptation implies allurement to evil;
   allurement involves a minimum of evil itself, and that is inconsistent
   with perfect purity.

   We may very easily get rid of this difficulty by refusing to recognise
   one or the other of the two sides which should here be held in
   conjunction with each other; i.e. by affirming either that Jesus was
   not really tempted, or that we must not be so precise in our view of
   sinlessness. And there are not a few who do either deny the reality of
   the temptation, or sacrifice the strict conception of sinlessness. But
   the problem is not solved in this way. On the contrary, since Scripture
   teaches both the temptation and sinlessness of Christ, it becomes the
   duty of theology to furnish an answer to the question whether both can
   be held without prejudice to either, or whether the one necessarily
   excludes the other. Our proper guide in answering this question is the
   well-known passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews. [163] Jesus was
   tempted in all points, yet without sin; i.e. He was tempted so as it is
   possible to be without the entrance of sin. We must conceive of His
   endurance of temptation with the qualification that He continued free
   from sin; and of His sinlessness, as having stood the test of every
   species of temptation. According to this, there must be temptation
   without sin, and temptation with sin: there is a limit within which
   temptation is without sin, beyond which it involves sin. Our task is
   consequently to determine the point at which temptation does become
   sin; and in order to accomplish this, we shall need to examine more
   closely the relation between sin and temptation. If our investigation
   be conducted on right principles, it will tend greatly to diminish the
   difficulty presented by the narrative of the actual temptation of our
   Lord.

   Our inquiry into the nature of sin has shown us that, although its
   focus is in the will, we are not to regard it as confined to that
   faculty. The life of the man in all its essential aspects must be taken
   into consideration. Reciprocity is the law of our constitution; and in
   virtue thereof, not only does the will, when affected by sin, act
   prejudicially on the other spheres of our life, but these latter also,
   when they are sinfully incited, exercise a corrupting influence upon
   the will. Sin does not take place simply by an abstract act of the
   will,--it is consummated only where there is a simultaneous darkening
   of the intelligence and imagination, by means of a stirring up of false
   and sensual emotions. The actual influence exerted by these different
   sides of our being varies according to the peculiarities of individual
   constitutions, and to the measure of our sinfulness. At the same time,
   however, with respect to the various spheres of our life, we must
   carefully distinguish between that which arises from their natural
   orderly action, and that which is already a beginning of sin.

   We cannot consider it sinful that that which is evil should present
   itself to the understanding and imagination, partly as objectively
   existent, and partly as a possibility; for this is just one of the
   things which man, as a moral being, cannot avoid. Nor can it with any
   greater reason be looked upon as in itself sinful, that a sense of the
   opposition between pleasure and pain should be called forth within us
   by distinct thoughts or images, and that the one should exert an
   attractive, and the other a repulsive, influence. Such experiences owe
   their existence to the fact that man is endowed with sensibilities and
   a physical body, which being inalienable parts of his nature, must be
   recognised as of Divine ordination. [164] The presentation of evil
   through the understanding or imagination only implies sin, when the
   thought or image rises from within ourselves. Then we consider its
   presence sinful, because it presupposes the groundwork of our soul to
   be corrupt. But in case the thought or image is suggested by the
   surrounding world, we are only chargeable with actual sin if we dwell
   thereon with approval; for then our moral judgment begins to be
   darkened, and an inclination towards evil to be felt. In like manner,
   the sensations, whether mental or bodily, of pleasure and pain, of the
   desirable and repulsive, can only be called sinful when they owe their
   rise to an opposition between spirit and flesh, already active in our
   personal life; or, at all events, they first acquire a sinful character
   when they prepare the way for the action of this antagonism, and
   produce desires whose satisfaction would be a transgression of the
   Divine order of our life.

   It cannot be denied that evil does enter man through the channels of
   thought and imagination, of feeling and sensibility. At the same time,
   however, it must not only be acknowledged that the real decision of the
   matter rests with the will,--because it is only by a determination of
   the will that man really appropriates evil, and makes it an internal or
   external act for which he is responsible,--but we must also keep in
   view the fact, that in the spheres of thought and imagination, of
   emotion and sensibility, there are boundary lines very clearly
   separating between that which is natural and that which is sinful.

   Our inquiry concerns, then, the relation which temptation bears to
   evil. In order to answer this question, we must bring before our minds
   the idea and nature of temptation. [165] By temptation, we mean every
   influence by which a personality intended for moral action may receive
   an impulse from good towards evil, every enticement to sin produced by
   any kind of impression, and especially such a one as, proceeding from
   some other person, is purposely designed to lead to sin. That which
   tempts may lie either in the man himself, in the form of disorderly
   desire or inclination; [166] or be presented from without, in the shape
   of a motive to sinful action. Still, a temptation coming from without,
   must enter the mind through the medium of thought or fancy or sensuous
   impression, or else it is as good; as not present. It must also exhibit
   the appearance of good; for mere evil, as such, does not tempt any but
   natures already Satanic. If evil is to tempt at all, it must appear as
   good; it must take the illusory form of a desirable possession,
   enjoyment, or other coveted result.

   Every being is liable to temptation whose nature is on the one hand
   susceptible of good, and does not on the other necessarily shut out the
   possibility of evil. God cannot be tempted, because the holiness of His
   nature exalts Him above all temptation. Irrational creatures cannot be
   tempted, because, being incapable of true good, they are also below
   temptation to evil. Man alone, free to choose, can be tempted, because
   he is a moral, though not yet in his inward nature a holy, personality.
   Temptation begins for him when evil is presented, at some point of his
   inner or outer life, in such a way that he can directly take it up into
   his own being. But man is exposed in two ways to the possibility, and
   seductive power, of evil. On the one hand, he may be drawn to actual
   sin by enticements; and, on the other hand, he may be turned aside from
   good by threatened, as well as by inflicted, suffering. The former may
   be termed positive, the latter negative, temptation. The one is notably
   illustrated in the story of Hercules at the two ways, the other in the
   sufferings of Job. [167] As evil, when it lays hold upon us, affects
   our life in its entirety, so does temptation assail us at different
   points, in order to gain possession of our will. Hence we may be
   tempted as truly through the thoughts and imaginations as through the
   emotions and senses; and in each case the temptation may be either a
   seduction to evil or a preventive from good, by means of either
   pleasure or pain.

   Where, then, is the point in temptation at which sin begins, or at
   which it becomes itself sin? It is there where the evil which is
   presented to us begins to make a determining impression upon the heart.
   We do not say an impression in a general sense,--for without making
   this, it would be no temptation at all,--but a determining impression,
   that is one which, first creating commotion in the mind in general,
   then seizes upon the will in particular, and inclines it towards an
   opposition to the Divine order. [168] Then we find that a conflict is
   awakened in man which is inconceivable without the presence of sin, be
   it only in the least degree. Disorderly desire and inward bias towards
   evil are themselves the beginning of sin; and if such desire has its
   root and source in our own inner being, it not only leads to sin, but
   presupposes the ground of our life to be already corrupt. At this stage
   it is sin itself that entices to sin,--sin as a condition leading to
   sin in act. But temptation does not imply sin, when the evil, as a
   thing coming from the world without, merely offers its allurements, and
   is repelled by the indwelling energy of the spirit; or when we are
   shaken by sufferings, whether of body or soul, and instead of giving
   way to ungodly states of feeling and tendencies of the will (as in
   certain circumstances we might do), endure patiently, and are sustained
   by our inner moral power.

   Contemplating the life of Jesus from this point of view, we can
   understand how He might be tempted, and yet remain free from sin. He
   was tempted in all points,--that is, He was tempted in the only two
   possible ways, specified above. On the one hand, allurements were
   presented which might have moved Him to actual sin; and, on the other
   hand, He was beset by sufferings which might have turned Him aside from
   the Divine path of duty. These temptations, moreover, occurred both on
   great occasions and in minute particulars, under the most varied
   circumstances, from the beginning to the end of His earthly course. But
   in the midst of them all, His spiritual energy and His love to God
   remained pure and unimpaired. Temptations of the first order culminated
   in the attack made on Jesus by Satan; temptations of the second order
   assailed Him most severely during the struggles of Gethsemane, and when
   He felt Himself forsaken by God on the cross. It will therefore be
   necessary to consider these two events more closely.

   At present we shall consider the narrative of the temptation [169] only
   in one aspect, namely, in its relation to the sinlessness of Jesus,
   with respect to the difficulty it may present in the way of a full
   recognition of that sinlessness. [170] At the same time some reference
   to the different modes of understanding that narrative will be
   unavoidable. In some explanations the sinlessness of Jesus is regarded
   as beyond all question; in others, on the contrary, it is imperilled.
   On this ground it will be necessary to pass the different
   interpretations briefly in review, and to decide to which our adherence
   shall be given. [171]

   Among such views of this narrative as are by no means at variance with
   the doctrine of Christ's sinlessness, may be regarded those which see
   in the accounts of the evangelists no actual occurrence, but simply a
   product of early Christian thought. The opinions of those who take this
   view are divided as to whether the account originated with Jesus
   Himself under the form of a parable, or with His immediate followers
   under the form of a myth. Whatever our judgment may be of explanations
   of this nature, it is quite clear that they do not endanger the
   sinlessness of Jesus. Neither as a parable, in which Jesus set forth
   the fundamental maxims according to which all efforts on behalf of His
   kingdom should be regulated, nor as a myth, in which His Church
   glorified Him as the conqueror of Satan, would it involve anything
   really at variance with His sinlessness. But though circumstances have
   helped to decide the preference of some recent theologians, amongst
   whom are Schleiermacher and Usteri, for the parabolical mode of
   interpretation, we cannot see our way clear to the adoption of such a
   method of escaping the difficulties; and simply for the reason, that we
   hold the view which underlies it to be an utterly inadmissible one: The
   entire character of the narrative, and especially the position it
   occupies between the baptism and public appearance of Jesus, argue too
   strongly that we have to, do with facts, and not with parable or myth.
   And even if it be true, which at present we do not stop to consider,
   that some portions of the account cannot be in every respect regarded
   as actual history, and must be looked upon as drapery, still we should
   have to hold fast a kernel of fact. When we reflect that it was
   involved in the human nature of Christ that He should be tempted;
   further, that the Gospels throughout know nothing at all of a Saviour
   who was not actually tempted; and finally, that it lay in the nature of
   the case, that that which could be a temptation to Him should present
   itself with special force at the commencement of His career,--we shall
   see the necessity of maintaining a substratum of fact in this history.

   But even when maintaining that we have before us the report of actual
   temptations undergone by Jesus, there are still, as is well known, a
   variety of possible explanations from this point of view also. Before
   entering on an examination of these, it will be advisable to come to
   some decision as to the essential meaning of the history, and thus to
   ascertain clearly that which must hold true under all circumstances,
   whatever may be the mode in which single points are treated.

   The narrative is undoubtedly set forth as an essential item of the
   gospel of Jesus as the Christ, as a constituent part of the life of
   Jesus as the Messiah. In this quality it is placed between that
   baptismal act which should, and did, inaugurate the Messiah, and the
   actual appearance of Jesus as the Messiah. By this we are indirectly,
   but notwithstanding plainly enough, taught that the temptation bore
   reference to Jesus in His Messianic character; that it was not merely a
   trial of the general human kind, but specially a trial of the Messiah.
   This is clear from the third temptation,--the offer of worldly
   dominion. But it is also distinctly hinted at in the two others, in the
   words, if Thou be the Son of God (Matt. iv. 3, 6); for these words do
   not relate to the human nature which Jesus had in common with us all,
   but to His higher dignity. Moreover, both these latter temptations
   manifestly presuppose a person, like the Messiah, endowed with
   extraordinary powers from God, and under special Divine protection. We
   may accordingly determine the essential feature of the temptation in
   one aspect to be, that Jesus, at a point of His career in which His
   whole future was involved, repelled, with all firmness and decision,
   the seductions of an external conception of Messianic glory, as ungodly
   and sinful, and decided, once for all, upon aims and modes of operation
   which were pure and well-pleasing to God.

   Linked together in this way, the individual temptations may be
   conceived as follows. The first, which was the temptation to change
   stones into bread, contains a call to the Messiah to employ His
   miraculous endowments for the satisfaction of His own immediate and
   pressing wants. In the second temptation, which was to cast Himself
   down from the pinnacle of the temple, He is urged to put that
   protection which is promised to God's chosen One to the test, by
   wilfully running into manifest danger. [172] The third temptation, in
   which the kingdoms of the world and their glory were exhibited before
   Him, appeals to Him to employ worldly, means for the realization of His
   idea of a world-wide theocracy. The rejoinders show that such is the
   significance of the temptations. To the first, Jesus answers that man
   does not live by bread alone, by that which only relieves his physical
   necessities,--but by every word that cometh from the mouth of God;
   [173] to the second He replies that we may not tempt the Lord our
   God,--we may not tempt arbitrarily, and unnecessarily call for His
   protection; to the third He rejoins,--making reference to the fact
   tl?at an external empire like those which had been spread out before
   Him could only be established by the service of the Prince of this
   world,--Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou
   serve. All three temptations converge in one central and fundamental
   thought--the thought of a kingdom which, although apparently Divine, is
   in reality only worldly, and opposed to the true kingdom of God, which
   is first founded in the hearts of men, and thence attains external
   visible realization. [174] The only way to the establishment of such a
   kingdom was through the prostitution of His higher Messianic endowments
   to the satisfaction of the desires of His physical nature and
   self-love; through a presumptuous confidence in Divine protection in
   paths of danger chosen by Himself; and finally, through a league with,
   and an entrance into, the service of the Prince of the world. On the
   contrary, it was only in a spirit of voluntary self-denial in the way
   prescribed by God, and by a distinct rupture with all the power and
   glory of this world, that the true kingdom of God could be founded. It
   was, consequently, the essential opposition between a kingdom which,
   corresponding to the views of the carnal mind, might be speedily and
   compulsorily set up, and one of self-sacrificing love, which could only
   be gradually established from within, and in the divinely ordered way,
   that now presented itself to the mind of Jesus. He who was sent to
   found a true theocracy was thus called upon, as He entered on His
   mission, for a distinct, full, and final decision on one side or the
   other.

   This is unmistakeably one aspect of the temptation of Jesus; but we
   cannot confine ourselves to it. Were we to do so, our conception of the
   whole matter would be far too abstract. The Tempter does undoubtedly
   appeal to Jesus as the Son of God, and very obviously endeavours to
   influence Him as such; but there must be no separation made between.
   the Son of God and the Son of man. In fact, the temptations endured by
   Jesus were real and genuine, for the simple reason, that whilst they
   tried Him in His character of Messiah, they also assailed Him as a man.
   A merely theoretical choice between a false and a true conception of
   Messiah would have been no temptation at all. It was indispensable that
   the false conception should have in it something of a blinding and
   bribing nature, [175] something that might prove seductive to the
   self-love of His sensuous nature. That such an element was present, is
   as unquestionable as it is evident that Jesus could only be open
   thereto so far as He shared the general human sensibility to pleasure
   and pain, to joy and sorrow. Only on this supposition could it be said
   of Him that He was tempted in all points like as we are. [176] In this
   sense His temptations have a general human as well as a special
   Messianic character. They exhibit the spiritual Head of our race as
   tried like our natural, physical head, but with contrary results.

   The seductive element in the several suggestions seems, so far as its
   human aspect is concerned, to have consisted partly in that which would
   prove tempting to human nature in general, and partly in that which
   would be specially alluring to men of a higher order, who are called to
   a higher vocation. There was, first of all, the inclination to use the
   gifts of God in the service of self; then there was the liability to
   entertain the fancy, that One entrusted with a Divine mission, and
   under the special guardianship of God, might unhesitatingly incur any
   danger, and even arbitrarily expose Himself thereto; and lastly, there
   was the desire for this world's power and glory. To temptation of the
   first kind men are exposed, as men; to seductions of the second kind,
   those are peculiarly liable who have the consciousness of a higher
   mission; by allurements of the third kind, those are mainly affected
   who feel themselves destined to rule. Jesus was exposed to all alike,
   for He was a man like ourselves; He had the certain consciousness of
   the highest mission, and He could say of Himself, I am a King. Here,
   however, again, the three temptations converged and united in one
   all-inclusive and fundamental temptation; and this lay in the choice
   between enjoyment and sacrifice, between self-will and the Divine
   order, between the service of the Prince of this world and the
   exclusive service of the holy God,--between the one as the essential
   principle of a kingdom of this world, and the other as the essential
   principle of the kingdom of God.

   We may hold, however, that this is the true significance of the
   temptation, and at the same time that the history is substantially a
   record of facts, and yet form very different conceptions of the facts
   themselves. For instance, the matter has been represented as follows:
   that Jesus brought before His own mind the chief features of the
   Messianic notions of His contemporaries, and consequently that the
   choice between a false and true Messiahship was made as a purely mental
   transaction. Such a view is, however, evidently too spiritualistic, and
   out of harmony with the character of the Gospel narrative. The words of
   the evangelists undoubtedly demand that we should form a more realistic
   conception of the whole event. They point out that the seductive
   thoughts were brought to Jesus from without, by means of an objective
   and personal power exterior to Himself. Thus to have contended with him
   who is in the highest and most general sense the Tempter, gives, too,
   to the conflict and victory of the Lord Jesus an unmistakeably sublime
   and universal significance, with respect both to the person concerned
   and the principles involved. Nevertheless, whatever stress we may lay
   upon the objective feature of the transaction, we must always at the
   same time admit that if it was anything more than the mere semblance of
   temptation, and is to be regarded as real, the seductive thoughts must
   have entered into the mind of Jesus, in such a manner that He did not
   merely hear, but also thought and felt them,--that, in short, they made
   an impression upon Him. Then there arises the question, which for us is
   the most important of all: Could such seductive thoughts, in whatever
   way they came, enter the soul of Jesus without sullying His moral
   purity, without putting an end to His sinlessness?

   We answer that this is quite conceivable. Two suppositions must,
   however, be most carefully avoided in connection with this matter. The
   one is, that the producing cause of these seductive thoughts was in any
   sense in the soul of Jesus Himself; and the other, that they gained any
   determining influence over the heart, the will, the life of Jesus. That
   neither was the case may be clearly shown.

   Undoubtedly, if the thoughts in question were produced in the soul of
   Jesus, the conviction would be forced upon us, that its ground was
   morally impure, corrupt, and that sin was present in Him in the shape
   of evil desire. But there is nothing whatever to warrant such a
   supposition. And further, we strike at once at the root of a hypothesis
   of this nature, when we hold by the recognition of a tempter who
   appeared objectively to Jesus. If we were even to admit that it was by
   the agency of His own mind that the Lord Jesus brought forward the
   false idea of the Messiah as an object of contemplation, any misgiving
   which might thereby arise is immediately obviated by distinguishing
   between the presentation and the origination of a thought. The
   expectation of a worldly Messiah was not a notion which had yet to be
   conceived; on the contrary, it was one everywhere rife, and which Jesus
   must have inevitably encountered on all sides in the world around. Nay,
   He could not carry out the true idea of the Messiah in its full extent,
   without also taking up into His thoughts its spurious counterpart. The
   full and decided appropriation of the one necessarily involved the
   rejection of the other; consequently, also its presence before His
   soul. In any case, then, we have only to do with the thought of
   something already actually-existing; and such a thought, though its
   object might include every element of sin, could not, of itself, be by
   any possibility defiling.

   There is of course another thing yet to be taken into consideration. If
   we are not to deem the moral purity of Jesus to have been stained by
   the presence of the seductive thoughts, we must not suppose them to
   have exerted any determining influence on His inner life: and this
   seems difficult to maintain, when we take the idea of temptation in
   right earnest. One concession must be made in this connection--viz.
   that the mere thinking of evil does not in itself constitute a
   temptation, and that, in order to its being a temptation, the evil must
   appear adapted to, and must be enticing to, the self-love of our
   sensuous nature. The false conception of Messiah, whether suggested by
   the devil or by the world, was of this nature. Moreover, there can be
   no doubt that Jesus, as being a real man, was susceptible of its
   influence. For to the nature of man enjoyment is always dearer than
   privation, honour than disgrace, and a throne than a cross. Not that we
   are to conceive the enjoyments of life, honour, and rule to be
   essentially sinful. They are that only under certain conditions. Nor do
   we necessarily contract defilement through our sense of the
   pleasantness of these things. Only when it has a corrupting effect on
   the moral feelings, disturbs the judgment, and gives an ungodly bias to
   the will and activity, can this be affirmed. But the narrative of the
   temptation exhibits the direct opposite of all this. Not like the first
   parents [177] of mankind, did Jesus dwell with pleasure on the
   temptation which was laid before Him. That was precisely the cause of
   their fall. Neither did He suffer a yea, hath God said,' to arise in
   His mind. With a quick resolution that is obvious from the whole
   narrative, without any lingering or longing hesitancy, He trampled the
   allurements under foot; and so directly did He in the thrice repeated
   It is written' oppose to each seductive suggestion the sword of the
   Spirit, that no ground whatever is left for the assumption that evil
   entered within so as to disturb and stain His feelings or imagination,
   His heart or will. [178] It is, however, the character of His whole
   subsequent life, and the moral consciousness expressed in every part of
   it, which is our strongest guarantee that His purity was maintained on
   this occasion also. So spotless was the purity that shone through all
   His acts and words, that it is inconceivable that the temptation,
   though real, should have involved for Him aught like the beginning of a
   fall, or aught of sin.

   The positive temptations of Jesus were not, however, confined to that
   particular point of time when they assailed Him with concentrated
   force. [179] They returned as often as impressions were made on Him
   from without, whose tendency was to draw Him away from complete
   faithfulness to His love of God, and from pure and holy activity on
   behalf of the kingdom of God. But still more frequently in after times
   was He called to endure temptation of the other kind,--the temptation
   of suffering; and this culminated on two occasions--viz. in the
   conflict of Gethsemane, and in that moment of agony on the cross when
   He cried, My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?

   The whole life of Jesus, as depicted by the evangelists, was pervaded
   by suffering. They were griefs of the intensest kind which pierced His
   soul during the contest of His loving will with the sin of the world;
   and to these were added bodily pains. Both conjoined reached their
   climax in the tortures of the cross,--than which no agonies can be
   conceived higher or more intense. Jesus never expressly sought, or
   capriciously exposed Himself to, suffering. Nor did He need to do so,
   for it came unsought. Still less did He purposely avoid it, seeing in
   it as He did an essential constituent of His Divine calling. He
   resigned Himself cheerfully to all that befell Him, and thus displayed
   a power of endurance, which, whilst never inconsistent with the human,
   always ensured victory to the Divine.

   The two events in question might be alleged as revealing a state of
   mind at variance with our assumption,--namely, the conflict of
   Gethsemane, in which suffering of soul is peculiarly manifest, and the
   moment on the cross in which the physical pain, added to the agony of
   soul, reached its highest point. In both instances Jesus seemed not to
   maintain the strength of mind consistent with sinless perfection, but
   to succumb to the weakness of human nature.

   There have not been wanting those who have found in the conflict of
   Gethsemane, [180] especially in the supposed struggle against death,
   something inconsistent with the greatness of Jesus in other respects;
   and in order to remove from the image of Jesus a feature which, in
   their view, disfigures it, they have resorted to the desperate means of
   declaring the whole incident unworthy of credit. [181] But the portion
   of the Gospel narrative in question is too well attested, both
   externally and internally, to justify any such violence. We must
   therefore endeavour to understand this paradox also of the life of
   Jesus. And in fact, when we look at it with an unprejudiced mind, it
   not only loses much of its strangeness, but gives besides a peculiar
   significance to the Person of Jesus, and to the relation in which He
   stands to ourselves. The incident exhibits Jesus to us in the full
   truth of His humanity, in His perfect nearness to men. Jesus, as a man,
   could not have had a heart filled with holy love, without feeling
   sorrowful, even unto death, at the hatred He encountered in return for
   His self-sacrifice,--a hatred manifesting, as it did, the dreadful
   degree to which the power of sin prevailed in the world. He could not
   have possessed that fulness of fresh and sensitive life which He
   everywhere revealed, without shuddering at the approach of a death of
   torture. But there is nothing sinful in the grief felt by love at
   unmerited hatred; nor in the wrestlings of a lofty soul with the sin of
   the world; nor in the natural recoil from death experienced by one
   whose life is healthy and energetic,--for this must not be confounded
   with a reflective shrinking from and resistance to death. [182] These
   are purely human conditions, and as such they were involved in the fact
   that the body and soul of Christ were of like nature with our own. They
   would have passed into sin, only if they had produced some alteration
   in feeling or will. And that such was not the case,--that, on the
   contrary, the spiritual nature of Jesus and His love to God rose
   victorious over the agitations of His feelings and the pains of His
   body,--is testified by the words, Father, not as I will, but as Thou
   wilt. These words cast a light and a glory on all that preceded
   them,--they tell of the complete inward victory gained by the Lord
   Jesus,--and prove that, even in the midst of such mental agony as this,
   He maintained a spotless purity.

   But the sufferings of Gethsemane were only a foretaste of those which
   in full reality and force preceded and accompanied His death on the
   cross. And on the cross His agony rose to such a point that He had a
   sense of being deserted by God,--to which feeling He gave utterance in
   the well-known words of the 22d Psalm, My God, my God, why hast Thou
   forsaken me? Desertion by God must not, in this case, be conceived of
   strictly, as objective, actual withdrawal of God from the Person of
   Jesus, but only as a subjective feeling of desertion. Efforts have,
   however, been made to do away even with this, on the supposition of its
   being unworthy of the Lord. Jesus, it is said, though He certainly
   cried out only in the first words of this Psalm, yet had in His mind
   its whole contents, and especially its close, which, far from being of
   a desponding nature, expresses the utmost confidence in the future
   victory of God's kingdom. To give matters this turn is, however,
   perfectly arbitrary, and, in opposition to the situation, transposes
   the whole from the sphere of direct spontaneous feeling to that of
   reflection. [183] We ought rather to take that which is historically
   recorded in all its significance and force, and at the same time to
   adhere to the rule of not treating a single saying as isolated and cut
   off from the connection in which it is found.

   The frame of mind and exclamation in question are manifestly an
   intensified counterpart of the agony of Gethsemane. Jesus had in fact,
   for the moment, the feeling that He was deserted by God, when physical
   tortures burst in upon Him in all their fearfulness, in addition to the
   deepest sorrow of heart. But this feeling was only a momentary one with
   Him whose whole being was rooted in God, although, in the circumstances
   and at the time, it made its presence known with the involuntariness of
   a force of nature. In no sense did it continue, or exert any influence
   over His inner life. It immediately gave way before, and yielded its
   due place to, a sense of His true relation to God. As in the conflict
   of Gethsemane the full submission to the will of the Father soon
   triumphed over His natural reluctance to drink the cup, so here, that
   sense of Divine desertion which rose involuntarily in His mind was at
   once swallowed up in the higher feeling, expressed first of all in the
   words, Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit, [184] and then in
   the crowning exclamation, It is finished. [185] Nay, it is manifest
   that the higher feeling had already begun to work, from the words in
   which Jesus expressed the sense of desertion; for He did not exclaim
   simply, O God ! O God!! but, My God! my God! He thus appropriated the
   God by whom He felt Himself forsaken as His God, and clung firmly to
   His fellowship with Him, notwithstanding the sense of desertion.
   Moreover, this feeling was something in itself so thoroughly strange to
   Him, that He expressed it, not in the form of a positive assertion, but
   of a question: thus hinting at its incomprehensibleness,--one might
   almost say, at its impossibility. [186]

   The perfect purity of Jesus shone forth, therefore, even in such
   circumstances as these. At the same time, we see and feel throughout
   that He was a man, and, as such, mightily moved and keenly sensitive.
   Nor could it be otherwise. The whole delineation of the Gospels forbids
   our making of the character of Jesus an ideal of stoical apathy and
   imperturbability. [187] In respect of wants and woes, of the
   susceptibility of His mind to emotion, and the sensibility of His body
   to suffering, He was a perfect type of humanity. We cannot, however,
   for this reason consider Him as ranking below, but above, the wise man
   of the Stoics. It is precisely in this particular that the morality of
   the Stoics is untrue. Man's highest moral task is not to realize the
   anti-human, but the purely human,--it does not consist in repressing
   his natural capacities, which, because natural, are ordained of God,
   but in employing them in, and glorifying them by, the service of the
   Divine Spirit and holy love. This is what we find in Jesus; and the
   most rigid moral judgment, so far from seeing therein anything sinful,
   must rather confess that it is this that brings Him so near to us, that
   shows Him to us as our Brother, and makes Him capable of being a real
   example to man. Nay, only on this condition could He also be a truly
   human Redeemer,--a High Priest who was Himself tempted and tried, who
   Himself in the days of His flesh offered up prayers and supplications
   with strong crying and tears, and is therefore touched with the feeling
   of our infirmities. [188]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [163] Heb. iv. 15. See on this subject Riehm, Lehrbegr. des Hebr. Br.
   i. pp. 317, etc., and 321, etc.

   [164] In the fact that Jesus had a body, and consequently sensibility,
   no ground or direct occasion of sin was involved. Sarx is ascribed to
   Him in a perfectly good sense, with reference, of course, to human
   limitations and lowliness, but with no reference at all to sin. In
   opposition to this, it is maintained by some, chiefly persons tinged
   with fanaticism,--as for example, formerly, by Dippel, Eschrich, Fend,
   and Poiret, and recently by the well-known Irving, through whom this
   point became the subject of a religious controversy in England,--that
   to Christ must be ascribed not simply flesh, but sinful flesh; and
   that, though in respect of His spirit and will He is to be held
   perfectly free from actual and habitual sin, it must yet be granted
   that in the matter of the senses and their sinful impulses, He was not
   different from other men. It is plain that these persons are somewhat
   lax in their views of sinlessness; for it is involved in the true idea
   of sinlessness that the sensuous impulses do not act independently of,
   and in opposition to, the spirit, but are altogether ruled by it.
   Moreover, the words of the apostle, to which they appeal, do not
   furnish a sufficient warrant for the doctrine. In the passage, Rom.
   viii. 3--ho Theos ton heautou huion pempsas en homoiomati sarkos
   hamartias--the word homoioma refers only to sarkos, and not at the same
   time to hamartias, and the meaning is, God sent His Son in such a form
   of flesh and corporeity, as was of like kind with ours, which have,
   through sin, departed from their original condition,--not like with
   respect to sinful inclination, which would make the apostle contradict
   himself (2 Cor. v. 21), but of like kind with respect to finiteness,
   limitation, the wants of physical life: Christ, though not sinful
   Himself, was yet a man just like us who are sinners, and subject to the
   same conditions of sensuous existence. Compare Flatt, Tholuck, and
   other commentators on this passage. For more extended discussions of
   this point, see Müller's Doctrine of Sin, i. 407 ff., and especially
   pp. 434-459, third ed.; and Nitzsch's System of Christian Doctrine, §
   129. J. E. W. Gericke, in an article on the effects of the death of
   Christ with respect to His own Person (Stud. u. Krit. 1843, ii. pp.
   261, etc.), has lately brought forward the view that, in virtue of His
   participation in the flesh of the human race, its hereditary
   corruption--though only in the smallest degree--was transmitted to the
   human nature of Jesus; yet that this sinful incentive in Him, ever
   conquered and kept far from His person by the Divine principle within
   Him, was fully abolished by His death and resurrection. This view also,
   apart from other objections, is without a firm scriptural foundation,
   and inconsistent with the fundamental views of the New Testament.

   [165] For the usage of the expressions peirazesthai and peirasmos in
   the New Testament, see Tholuck's Commentary on the Sermon on the Mount,
   pp. 432 ff., and Kern's Brief Jacobi, p. 125 ff. This subject is also
   further discussed in Köster's Bibl. Lehre von der Versuchung, Gotha
   1859, and Palmer's article, Versuchung, in Herzog's Theol. Real-Encycl.

   [166] This is the epithumia of which St. James speaks as the usual
   commencement of sin in man (Jas. i. 14). This kind of temptation
   presupposes a germ of evil already within the man himself, and is
   irreconcilable with moral perfection in the strict sense.

   [167] Luther places temptations through suffering on the left hand, and
   those through pleasure on the right, and thus declares the latter to be
   the stronger and more dangerous (Works, B. vii. p. 1165).

   [168] Luther well distinguishes between sentire tentationem and
   consentire tentationi. Unless the tempting impression be felt, there is
   no real temptation; but unless it be acquiesced in or yielded to, there
   is no sin.

   [169] Matt. iv. 1-11; Mark i. 12, 13; Luke iv. 1-13.

   [170] The following essays, which advert to my own earlier view, may be
   compared in this connection: Usteri, Ueber die Versuchung Christi,
   Stud. u. Krit. 1829, 3, and 1832, 4; Hasert in the same, 1830, 1;
   Hocheisen, Bemerkungen über die Vers. Gesch., in the Tübingen
   Zeitschrift f. Theologie, 1883, 2; Kohlschütter zur Verständigung über
   die Vers. Gesch., in Käuffer's Bibl. Studien, Jahrg. 2. The most recent
   discussions of the subject are by E. Pfeiffer in the Deutsche
   Zeitschrift, May 1851; and by Rink in the same periodical, September
   1851; also by Laufs in the Studien und Kritiken, 1853, 2.

   [171] At present briefly; more fully in a special appendix.

   [172] The supposition that the second temptation calls for a miracle of
   display, now seems to me to come far behind the explanation given
   above. Compare Kohlschütter in Käuffer's Bibl. Studien, Jahrg. 2, pp.
   75, 76.

   [173] According to another view, we must not anticipate the command of
   God, who has a thousand means of preserving life.

   [174] Compare Neander's Life of Jesus, fifth ed. p. 118.

   [175] Special emphasis is rightly laid on this point by Kohlschütter,
   pp. 68-71.

   [176] Heb. iv. 15, where the words kath' homoioteta are not employed
   without purpose.

   [177] Gen. iii. 6.

   [178] Therefore, as Hocheisen justly observes in the Tübingen Theolog.
   Zeitschrift, 1833, 2, p. 115, no parallel can be drawn between the
   temptation of Christ and Prodikus's story of Hercules and the two ways;
   for a hesitation of choice between two ways cannot be spoken of in
   connection with Jesus. In order to anticipate and cut off possible
   difficulties, Menken, in his Betrachtungen über den Matthæus, i. 104,
   would have the whole transaction termed trial instead of temptation.
   But the Scriptures do not sufficiently justify this change. Inasmuch as
   Satan comes before us peirazon, we may fairly apply the distinction
   made even by Tertullian: Deus probat, Diabolus tentat.

   [179] In Luke iv. 13 it is said Satan departed from Jesus achri kairou:
   and Jesus Himself speaks of His temptations in the plural number (Luke
   xxii. 28).

   [180] Matt. xxvi. 36-47; Mark xiv. 32-43; Luke xxii. 39-47.

   [181] See Usteri, Studien and Kritiken, 1829,3, p. 465. Usteri thinks
   that if the tradition were true, he must rank Jesus under Socrates. On
   the other side, compare the beautiful parallel between the death of
   Jesus and that of Socrates, in de Wette's Wesen des christlichen
   Glaubens, § 53, p. 270. Rousseau says, in his pithy manner, If Socrates
   suffered and died like a philosopher, Jesus suffered and died like a
   God.'

   [182] Hasert justly remarks, Studien and Kritiken, 1830, 1, p. 72, that
   the impulse of our physical nature to secure itself against destruction
   is a natural expression of our life, belonging essentially to its
   character, and therefore not necessarily involving sin.

   [183] Matt. xxvii. 46, and Meyer's Commentary on this passage.

   [184] Luke xxiii. 16.

   [185] John xix. 30.

   [186] Both, in fact, were implied in the passage from the Psalms, of
   which Jesus availed Himself yet if it had not fully expressed His
   actual feelings, He would either not have used it, or have altered it
   to suit His need. But even the passage in the Psalms itself does not
   express the feeling of desertion alone, nor speak of this as a
   permanent state of mind, as the whole context plainly shows. Even in
   the Psalmist's mouth, the saying cannot be taken in an absolute sense,
   much less in that of the Lord Jesus.

   [187] As among the Fathers, Clement of Alexandria was inclined to do,
   and therefore applied to Christ the expression, anepithumetos. For
   examples, see Hagenbach's History of Doctrines, §§ 66 and 67.

   Sec. 4.--Other Acts and Expressions of Jesus, as Arguments against His
   Sinlessness.

   If, then, there is nothing in the facts that Jesus underwent a temporal
   development, and that He was tempted, which compromises His
   sinlessness, another question arises, namely, as to whether we do not
   find in His works and discourses themselves, much that is inconsistent
   with moral perfection. An affirmative answer to this question would
   constitute the most striking and satisfactory refutation of what has
   been hitherto advanced. Several things of this nature were urged even
   by the contemporaries of Jesus. Others have been brought forward more
   recently. Some of these seem almost frivolous, and scarcely worthy of
   notice. Yet the removal of even subordinate misunderstandings may be
   useful, when they threaten to deface so elevated a form as that of
   Jesus.

   Amongst the .scanty traditions of the earlier period of the life of
   Jesus, has been preserved that account of His peculiar ripeness at
   twelve years of age (Luke ii. 41-52), which we have already several
   times brought forward as very significant in relation to His mental
   development. But there is the appearance of a blemish even in
   connection with that remarkable circumstance. The boy might be
   reproached with disobedience, with wilfulness, for remaining behind in
   the temple. In examining the matter, however, more closely, this
   apparent blemish vanishes. Not a word hints that His parents looked
   upon Him as in fault for remaining behind. The exclamation of His
   mother was simply the spontaneous expression of tender concern.
   Further, we can easily conceive of many circumstances arising, where
   the family relationships were less constrained, which might give
   occasion to the separation, without neglect on the part of the parents,
   or self-will on the part of the Son. On the other hand, we may discern
   even in the boy the same Jesus, who, as a man, rising above the narrow
   limits of family connections, and subordinating everything that was
   private and peculiar to His vocation, could say, Who is my mother? who
   are my brethren? and on another occasion could address His mother,
   Woman, what have I to do with thee? His energies were to be devoted to
   the whole of mankind, and the spirit requisite thereto must needs have
   been manifested at an early period.

   In the properly Messianic period of the life of Jesus there were many
   things at which even His own contemporaries cavilled. Scrutinized,
   however, more closely, they only furnish one proof more of the elevated
   nature of His moral life. Of this kind are the reproaches, that He did
   not live ascetically like the Pharisees, nor even like John the
   Baptist, but ate and drank like ordinary men; that He associated with
   publicans and sinners; that He broke the Sabbath by healing the sick;
   and the like. But it was precisely in opposition to such
   narrow-heartedness that Jesus manifested by word and deed the grand
   principles of a freer morality,--of that morality which flows from the
   fountain of Divine love, and which raises the gospel so far above the
   level of all legal service: precisely then did He take occasion to
   defend the simple and genuinely human cheerfulness of a truly pious
   life, which is marred by no spurious asceticism, but receives and uses
   all God's gifts thankfully and temperately: precisely then, too, did He
   propound those simple doctrines, that the disposition is the test of
   genuine morality; that love is more than sacrifice; that ordinances are
   for man, and not man for ordinances, and lay them down as eternal
   truths in forms appropriate to the time.

   The evangelists have artlessly recorded many doings of Jesus with that
   unreflective objectivity which is peculiar to them, without ever
   thinking that they might give moral offence. It is only the
   sensitiveness of the modern world that has found them strange. and
   offensive. Some things of this kind scarcely deserve examination; as,
   for example, the cursing of the fig-tree. [189] The reproach, that He
   was interfering with the property of others, is in no sense well
   founded, and is almost too frivolous to be mentioned. And even the
   notion, that Jesus here manifested personal irritation against a
   lifeless object, disappears as soon as we remark that He was
   performing--and that too, undoubtedly, with perfect self-possession--a
   work of prophetically instructive import, designed symbolically to
   announce the destruction of the spiritually unfruitful Jewish people.
   There are other things which do in part present real difficulty, and
   therefore demand a more careful consideration. With greater apparent
   justice might Jesus be accused of interference with the rights of
   property in that noteworthy act in the country of the Gadarenes, [190]
   where it cannot be denied that the cure performed by Him was directly
   coupled with damage to the inhabitants of the district. Almost all
   commentators on this passage. have believed it necessary to offer an
   apology for Jesus and naturally this has been done in various ways,
   according to the different points of view of the writers. We should
   hesitate to excuse Jesus, as many recent commentators have attempted to
   do, on the ground of His not foreseeing the result; [191] for this is
   at variance with the idea which the evangelists give of Him. And, on
   the other hand, we might justly urge that Jesus acted here, as He did
   generally in His miracles, as the Plenipotentiary of God. When God, in
   the pursuance of higher aims, destroys single things, when He permits
   the destruction of human possessions by natural forces, who dare charge
   Him with injustice? The complicated system of the universe requires it,
   and particular occurrences are ordered on the plan of a wisdom which is
   beyond our comprehension. Jesus also stood .on this position of higher
   wisdom and authority and whoever objects to His acting out of the
   fulness of Divine right, can hardly justify. Him in a manner that will
   harmonize with the general representation of the Gospels. But it has
   been urged, and not altogether without reason, against this mode of
   treating the question, that it lies out of the proper sphere of an
   apology, whose business it is to justify Jesus according to the general
   laws of human action. We take our stand, therefore, entirely on the
   ground, that Jesus, on this as on every occasion, was fulfilling His
   mission; not indeed without foresight of the consequence of His acts,
   but without suffering Himself to be influenced thereby. The aim of that
   mission was to save the lives and souls of men; and the possible
   destruction of irrational creatures, or the contingency of a loss which
   might be replaced, could not possibly restrain Him therefrom. Nay, His
   conduct on this occasion rather serves to place in a clearer light the
   high value which Jesus attached to man as the image of God.

   But if we are not justified in regarding Jesus as under the influence
   of passion when He cursed the fig-tree, there is another occurrence
   recorded by the evangelists, in connection with which we can scarcely
   avoid such a supposition,--namely, the driving out those who were
   buying and selling in the temple. [192] It is even possible to describe
   it in such a way as to give it the appearance of a low and violent
   action. [193] There is, however, nothing to authorize such a
   delineation; for it was certainly not the employment of external
   chastisement or threats, but His holy earnestness and personal dignity,
   which gave to the action of the Lord Jesus its impressiveness and
   efficacy. Their feeling that He was in the right, and they in the
   wrong, drove the traffickers out of the temple. Notwithstanding, there
   do remain traces of angry ebullition in the act, which contrast with
   the usual mildness of Jesus. The disciples themselves were sensible of
   the presence of a devouring zeal in His conduct on this occasion. [194]
   But here the distinction must be observed between personal passion and
   the noble anger felt by one entrusted with a high calling. It is not as
   a Jewish Rabbi that Jesus stands opposed to these Jewish traffickers,
   but it is as the divinely appointed Purifier of the theocracy that He
   stands opposed to the desecration of the sanctuary of God; and this
   position gave Him the right to act in a way which need not be justified
   according to traditional rules. Even if the doubtful jus zelotarum were
   recognised, it would not be necessary to appeal to it in order to clear
   the conduct of Jesus from blame. He was wielding that power of
   chastisement which is truly connected with the office of Prophet,--that
   power which has been and should be exercised in all . ages and among
   all peoples by higher natures called with such a vocation, whenever
   earthly relations and the course of justice, according to existing
   laws, are unable to stem the growing corruption.' [195] Such an action,
   however, could never have been performed but under the influence of an
   overpowering earnestness and an intensely indignant zeal. Such zeal for
   the Divine honour is, however, not unworthy of the purest; and in
   periods of corruption, nothing that is truly great can be accomplished
   without it.

   The relation between Jesus and Judas also offers peculiar difficulty.
   [196] If Jesus knew Judas, why. did He enroll His future betrayer among
   the apostles? And if He did not see through him, what have we to say on
   behalf of the moral penetration of Jesus? In either case, did not Jesus
   here make a mistake? In giving a satisfactory answer to this question,
   all depends on our conception of the moral condition of Judas when
   called to association with Jesus. Substantially, there are three
   different views of this matter possible, each of which leads to a
   different solution of the difficulty. According to the first, Judas, at
   the time of his acceptance by Jesus, had already within him the germs
   of his after sins--ambition and covetousness, but the good was still
   predominant in his soul; and further, Jesus hoped to accomplish his
   complete renovation, and then to avail Himself of the strong nature of
   Judas as an able instrument for the advancement of His cause, but was
   foiled in His gracious intentions. [197] According to the second view,
   Judas, when he came into contact with Jesus, had already fallen
   irrecoverably a prey to evil; [198] and Jesus chose him, not only with
   the distinct knowledge that he would be, but--since it was necessary
   that treachery should bring to pass the death of the Redeemer--also
   with the intention that he should be, His betrayer. He chose him,
   moreover, that in him a most striking example might be given how even
   one so utterly corrupt could but subserve the execution of the Divine
   purposes. According to the third view, when Judas was called to be an
   apostle, evil was, indeed, already predominant in him, but not
   absolutely supreme. His proximity to Jesus might influence him for good
   or for evil, and it was worth while to make the attempt to recover him.
   If Judas were gained to the side of the good, he would prove one of the
   most powerful of the apostles; if he were lost, he must still of
   necessity serve the plan of Jesus. Jesus was prepared for any issue He
   saw, even at an early period of their connection, [199] how Judas would
   decide; but He did not then cast him out, partly because He would act
   towards him with the utmost forbearance, partly because the proximity
   of Judas, even in the case of his yet deeper fall, would answer His
   further purposes.

   The first of these views not only supposes that Jesus was deceived,
   which is irreconcilable with the depth and acuteness of His
   penetration, but rests also on a misconception of the true nature of
   moral development. In order to reach the degree of evil at which we
   find Judas, its influence over him must have been for a longer period
   growing stronger and stronger, and working its way into all the parts,
   into the very tissue of his being. Had he entered into the fellowship
   of Jesus with a predominant susceptibility to good impressions, the
   result would have been different. Moreover (and this is decisive), this
   view clearly contradicts the declaration of John, [200] that Jesus knew
   the traitorous designs of Judas even at the earliest stage of their
   intercourse. The second view rather cuts than unties the knot. It
   considers the matter only in its relation to the end aimed at, whilst
   primarily it ought to be examined from the point of view of the
   determining cause; it makes a leap from the region of the historical to
   that of the metaphysical, and explains the obscure by that which is
   still more obscure: it further supposes a degree of wickedness in Judas
   that strips him of everything human, and this notwithstanding that his
   repentance, although perverse in its operation and results, testified
   to some remains of goodness,--notwithstanding, too, that even his
   violent and desperate death exhibited traces of his former greatness.
   Finally, it assumes that it was necessary that a member of His most
   intimate circle should betray Jesus, which does not by any means seem
   to have been the case when we bear in mind the publicity of His life.

   The first two views being untenable, only the third remains for our
   adoption. This has also its difficulties, but will be justified by the
   remarks which follow. It was the destiny of Jesus, in His entire
   manifestation, to divide the Divine from the ungodly, the good from the
   evil,--to awaken and quicken the one, and to punish and spiritually
   overcome the other. Even whilst on earth, He thus manifested and judged
   the hearts of men. In and through Him were the thoughts of the heart to
   be revealed: He was to be for the rising again and the fall of many.
   Either of the two results, considered in itself, might have followed in
   the case of Judas. He was still a man, and, as such, capable of
   salvation: he might fall, but he might too, like Peter, rise again--a
   ray of holy love might yet penetrate his soul. That this would not take
   place, was not clearly to be foreseen; for evil, being in its nature
   arbitrary, its development cannot be calculated with certainty. Looking
   to the possibility of a change for the better, Jesus chose him. But by
   an act of wickedness, which is at the bottom as incapable of rational
   explanation as evil generally is, Judas hardened himself, even whilst
   in communion with the purest goodness. Thus that Divine love which
   might have saved him, only worked his destruction. And just as all evil
   must finally serve the good, so Judas, when the process of hardening
   had once set in, was compelled to further the ends of Jesus. In
   contrast to the purity of Jesus, he exhibited sin in all its
   abominableness; and by bringing about the catastrophe of the death of
   Jesus, he helped on the accomplishment of the work of redemption.
   Through him it became possible for Jesus to enter into the suffering of
   death, without seeking it Himself. Finally, too, by his own desperate
   death, he testified to the purity of Him whom he had betrayed. In all
   this, however, we must not seek the end, the reason, but only the
   result of the choice of Judas by Jesus. The choice was dictated by the
   motives indicated above, and these cannot but be acknowledged to have
   been pure, since they were based on the hope of the salvation even of a
   Judas.

   But it is finally and almost triumphantly asked, Did not Jesus Himself
   decline the predicate good,' and thereby deny His sinless perfection?
   Did He not answer the young man who saluted Him as Good Master,' with
   the plain words which it is impossible to misunderstand, Why callest
   thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God?' [201] What
   more can be needed than the testimony of Jesus Himself against the
   notion of His sinless perfection? [202] To this we reply: It is indeed
   true that Jesus did decline the predicate good,' but not in such a
   sense as to exclude the idea of His perfection. His words have a
   totally different tendency; and here, as in other instances, everything
   will be found to depend upon the occasion which gave rise to them, and
   the connection in which they are found.

   The young man who accosted Him, believed, as the sequel shows, that he
   had already fulfilled the whole law, and was under the delusion that in
   this respect he lacked nothing. He wanted to learn from Jesus, as from
   a master undoubtedly capable of instructing him, what exceptionally
   good thing' he must do to obtain, besides the blessings promised by the
   law, eternal life. Can it then be supposed that Jesus would have
   responded to a young man of this kind,--one who used a word so full of
   meaning as good' twice in one breath, in so light and thoughtless a
   manner,--by imparting to him information concerning the moral
   constitution, and indeed the moral imperfection, or even the sinfulness
   of his own person? It is evident that instruction very different from
   this was needed by the young man. With all his good intentions, his
   whole moral nature was infected with self-complacency and shallowness.
   What he lacked was self-knowledge, acquaintance with the Divine
   holiness and his own sinfulness. This Jesus perceived from his words,
   and it was towards this end that all which He said to him was directed.
   And first of all He takes up his just uttered salutation, Good Master,'
   and at one mighty stroke, as it were, shows him, in the most forcible
   manner even though for the moment He might not be fully understood by
   His hearer--the fathomless depth, the immeasurable fulness, contained
   in that little word good.' God alone, says the Lord, is good;' but what
   He more specially meant by this, must be determined by the meaning of
   the expression good' in this place; and when we reflect how it was used
   by way of contrast to its inconsiderate application by the young man,
   and take into account the entire character of this address, this
   meaning can be none other than the most pregnant of which the term is
   susceptible.

   Undoubtedly there is a sense in which goodness can be attributed to God
   alone, and another in which it may also be applied to man. The first is
   its absolute sense; and that this is the sense which it bears in the
   passage in question, is obvious so soon as the whole purport of the
   saying is considered. In this sense God is good, as the eternally
   perfect and unimpeachably holy One who can be nothing else but good
   Himself, and is at the same time the original source of all good in
   others. But if Jesus, by this intimation, would exclude all that is not
   God from goodness, there are two things which He certainly would not
   do. He would neither, as older theologians suppose, indirectly allude
   to His own Divinity, [203] nor, as more recent ones assert, represent
   Himself in general terms as not good, and consequently sinful. The
   first notion would be an allusion of too vague and artificial a nature;
   the second a self-contradiction of so glaring a kind, as no one would
   venture to put into the mouth of Jesus. [204] On the other hand, He
   undoubtedly did intend to reject the attribution to Himself of goodness
   in that absolute, that purely Divine sense, of which we have spoken.
   And not without reason. For His moral perfection did not appertain, as
   that which was purely Divine, to the sphere of eternal being, [205] but
   to that of temporal existence; His goodness was not, like the Divine
   goodness, absolutely unexposed to temptation. and raised above all
   change, but a goodness capable of development, and to be perfected by
   temptations, conflicts, and sufferings. He was as yet in the very midst
   of His great mission, and the heaviest trials and sufferings still
   awaited Him. Thus viewed, the expression by no means excludes the
   perfection which is possible within the sphere of human existence. It
   only declines an attribute which is absolute and Divine; it does not
   deny that the moral nature of Jesus is sinless, but it does affirm that
   it is liable to temptation. We have here the testimony of Jesus Himself
   to His genuine and proper humanity in a moral point of view, and a
   noble expression of the humility which knows that the victory has not
   yet been won, as contrasted with the self-complacency which could
   inquire, What lack I yet?'--but by no means a confession of sinfulness.

   We have thus, we trust, solved all the graver difficulties offered by
   particular occurrences. [206] Yet a few more general remarks seem
   desirable with reference to the French author, [207] who has of late
   most strongly insisted upon them. This author occupies a very peculiar
   standpoint. He desires to appear, not as decidedly opposing, but rather
   as seriously doubting, the sinlessness of Christ. Yet his questioning
   points far more to a negative than an affirmative reply. On one side,
   he not only willingly acknowledges, on the ground of the Gospel
   delineation, the peculiar moral greatness of Jesus, but often speaks of
   it even with enthusiasm, and adheres, after his own fashion, to the
   belief that He was a teacher of the very highest excellence. [208] On
   the other side, he sees between this relative greatness--even granting
   it to have attained the very highest degree--and absolute perfection,
   an abyss [209] which his faith cannot pass. He is hindered partly by
   the consideration that the moral nature of Jesus is not laid open to us
   as to the inmost motives of His heart, nor during every stage of
   life,--partly by a regard to certain actions and expressions which seem
   to place insuperable difficulties in the way of admitting His sinless
   perfection. [210] We cannot regard such a standpoint as tenable. If we
   once go so far as to admit that the moral greatness of Jesus is of so
   superlative a kind that nothing surpassing it is to be found within the
   sphere of human nature, and if we do this on the ground of the Gospel
   delineation, we shall be constrained to take the further step which
   leads to a belief in His sinless perfection. For the same Jesus whom,
   from the Gospel statements, we acknowledge to be so great, is He who,
   in the same documents, constantly attributes to Himself a moral and
   religious nature and position which we--in the sense which He Himself
   furnishes--designate no otherwise than as absolutely perfect. If,
   however, we either cannot, or will not, take this step, we have no
   choice but to retreat from our former position, and, by relinquishing
   the historical ground of the Gospels, to declare the general greatness
   of Christ to be altogether doubtful. In short, if Jesus, as we know Him
   from history, is as great as Pécaut admits, He is also perfect; but if,
   according to the given conditions, He is not perfect, then He is not
   truly great in any sense: the greatness ascribed to Him dwindles to
   such a degree, that it becomes altogether inappreciable.

   With regard to the difficulties offered by certain particulars, we are
   certainly not of opinion that they are at once to be disposed of; on
   the contrary, we have done our best to solve them. But even granting
   that neither the explanations which we or others have offered should be
   found sufficient to obviate all objections, does it follow that the
   sinlessness of Christ must be given up, or even regarded as utterly
   problematic? By no means. For the sinless perfection of our Lord is no
   individual view or sectarian tenet, no hobby of this or that
   theologian, but the firm persuasion of all Christendom in every age,--a
   persuasion arising from the overpowering impression produced by His
   whole life and character. A persuasion of so universal a kind, and one
   confirmed by its effects, will not be given up, like some doubtful
   hypothesis, because difficulties are encountered in certain obscure
   passages, which it is not easy to solve, or whose solution by others is
   not deemed satisfactory. In a phenomenon of such unfathomable depth, of
   such immeasurable greatness, as the personality of Jesus Christ, there
   must necessarily be, from the very nature of the case, points which
   will ever be enigmatical. Divine truth could not be such if it were in
   all respects on a level with our understandings, and presented no
   paradoxes to our minds. In the case of such phenomena in general, we
   must, first of all, abide by the unquestionable impression produced by
   the whole, and thence endeavour to appreciate and understand
   particulars. In the case of Scripture especially, we must not make what
   is obscure the standard of what is more clear, but, on the contrary,
   must determine the meaning of the less comprehensible by that which is
   plainer. If these rules are granted, their result in the present case
   is obvious. The testimony of Scripture to the sinlessness of Christ is
   as clear as noon-day, while the purport and references of those
   passages which might excite a doubt of it, are by no means so
   transparent as to justify us in taking them as our criterion in
   deciding on the moral character of Jesus.

   Our opponent repeatedly insists upon the axiom, [211] that the conduct
   of Jesus is to be estimated only according to ordinary moral standards,
   and not according to some superhuman. code. This he applies to certain
   expressions and requirements of Christ, especially to His address to
   His mother, on the occasion of His first miracle, His saying to the
   Canaanitish woman, and His command to the disciple, who desired first
   to bury his father, [212] --which he finds unnecessarily harsh and
   severe. Our reply is as follows:--If this axiom is to be so understood
   as to include those moral principles which were first introduced into
   the world by Christianity, it is not in itself incorrect. It becomes
   so, however, if these principles are excluded, and only an abstract
   general morality left. And this is the manner in which Pécaut holds it.
   He everywhere ignores that mission of Jesus which can never for a
   moment be separated from His Person. In all these cases, indeed, the
   Lord Jesus spoke and acted, not as some chance individual usurping
   undue authority, but as one undoubtedly certain of being the Founder
   and Head of the kingdom of God. What He said or did in this sense,
   always bore the distinct impress of a regard both to the stage of
   development which this kingdom had at the time reached, and to the
   special spiritual necessities of the individuals in question, whose
   faith might need to be encouraged, to be tested, or to be guarded
   against relapse, by means more or less vigorous, nay, even sharp;--not
   that such a regard could indeed alter the general principles of
   morality in His case, though it might give to their application that
   form which the nature of the kingdom of God demanded. Now the
   fundamental law of this kingdom is self-denial and
   self-renunciation,--its chief requirement, that it should be regarded
   as the supreme good, with which none other can stand in competition. To
   such a standard, and to such a standard only, did the Lord Jesus
   conform His demands, and by it was a sharper line of action prescribed
   to Him, with all His gentleness, in certain cases, than would have been
   becoming to an individual in a more ordinary position.

CHAPTER II.

  ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF SINLESSNESS IN GENERAL.
     __________________________________________________________________

   WHEN the arguments against the actual sinlessness of Jesus, taken from
   matters of fact, are found to be inadequate, the possibility of
   sinlessness in the domain of human life may still be called in
   question. For if, indeed, such perfection were intrinsically impossible
   to human nature, it could not have been realized in the Lord Jesus, in
   so far as He shared that nature. Such an impossibility has been
   asserted, and reasons have been urged in support of it, which are
   partly drawn from experience, and partly from the nature of the moral
   idea, and the mode of its realization. The examination of the reasons
   of both kinds thus brought forward, is now, therefore, incumbent on us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sec. 1.--Arguments drawn from Experience.

   In many cases, undoubtedly, the fruit of experience in connection with
   the moral relations of life, is distrust of the purity of human virtue,
   and unbelief in the existence of true goodness and greatness amongst
   men. The more earnestly we examine the phenomena of human life around
   us, and the workings of our own hearts, the harder is it to attain the
   conviction, that there ever did live one who was wholly pure and
   perfect. Whithersoever our eyes are turned, we find concealed, under a
   thousand captivating forms, vanity and ambition, the pursuit of
   possessions, power, and enjoyment; malevolence and envy; and, above
   all, that evil of evils, selfishness, which in the subtlest way creeps
   into volitions and acts of a nobler character. Seldom does it fall to
   our lot to rejoice at the sight of a really pure deed never have we the
   happiness to discover a man whose life is an unblemished picture of
   moral perfection. The eye of our spirit becomes, in consequence, so
   accustomed to the constant spectacle of imperfection, to this
   chiaroscuro of human life, that we are in danger of ultimately losing
   the power of recognising a character of perfect moral purity, when
   presented before us. And it is an undeniable fact, that the knowledge
   of human nature on which many plume themselves, ends in the miserable
   and comfortless result of absolute moral scepticism.

   But that acquaintance with man which leads to such a conclusion really
   begins with the principle of mistrust and there must have been
   beforehand an inclination to discover defects, and either not to pay
   attention to the good, or to attribute it to bad motives. Besides, such
   a knowledge is proved to be spurious, by the fact of its giving a
   result that tends to destroy our best powers, faith and love, and that
   blights at the root all self-sacrificing effort for the welfare of
   mankind. Moral scepticism, consistently carried out, possesses no firm
   ground on which to base a moral judgment, and does in fact ultimately
   undermine all those higher relations which rest upon such a judgment.
   [213] In opposition to such a system, the mind of man, when unaffected
   by sophistries, will ever cleave to the belief that it is possible--at
   least from the tendency of a whole life--to recognise moral differences
   between man and man, not indeed infallibly, but still with sufficient
   certainty to satisfy an earnest and modest mind. Such a mind, pursuing
   its inquiries in a spirit of love, will never renounce its faith in
   human virtue. And there will be less danger of this, because such a
   faith does not entirely rest upon mere experience: it is based also
   upon something far higher,--upon the perception of the purposes of God
   in and for mankind. Hence faith in humanity, as well as faith in God,
   with which it is connected, is independent of experience, nay, often
   maintains its power in opposition to experience. Man is destined to
   good by God, and the law of his being is not selfishness and sin, but
   holiness and love. What, then, could justify us in believing that,
   universally and necessarily, only exceptions to this law are possible,
   and that never and nowhere can there be a fulfilment of it? If we have
   a strong and living faith in the destiny of humanity, we shall always
   be ready and willing to acknowledge that some one can become, and to
   recognise that One actually has become, what man should properly
   be,--an image of his holy Creator. If we have sufficient evidence to
   warrant our believing that there has been such a realization, no
   experiences of a contrary kind, however numerous, should prevent our
   reception of this one fact. Nor must we allow it to stand in our way,
   that this has not lain within the range of our own direct experience. A
   resolution in moral matters to admit only that which falls under our
   own observation, would make our circle of vision an exceedingly
   contracted one. Not only would our faith in the absolutely pure virtue
   of the Redeemer be overthrown, but even our faith in the moral
   excellence of all beyond the limits of our own sphere of life. The
   moral nature of man devolves upon him the duty of believing in general
   in higher virtue, even when it does not occur within the sphere of his
   own individual experience; and we cannot, therefore, rightly refuse
   faith in a perfect and pure virtue, when there is satisfactory evidence
   of the fact of its historical realization.

   It may, however, be further asked: Is it not a universal, indubitable
   truth, that the very nature of man renders it impossible for him ever
   to be perfectly good? Does not experience show us that, to be human at
   all, involves both sinfulness and actual sin? The question thus started
   is of a very comprehensive nature; and we shall do well to examine, one
   by one, the different elements of which it is composed. [214]

   And, first, it has been urged that, if we ascribe to Jesus the
   possibility of sinning, we must also conceive of Him as subject to
   sinfulness for sinfulness consists precisely in the possibility of sin,
   and not in the sum of actually committed sins. Sinfulness implies
   necessarily a minimum of sin, and therefore excludes absolute
   sinlessness.' [215] On the assumption that Jesus was a true, a real
   man, it cannot of course be denied that it was possible for Him to sin.
   This possibility is directly involved in human nature, in so far as
   this is to be morally developed. And if we assume that the possibility
   of sin means exactly the same as sinfulness, then it must be at once
   conceded that a germ of sin is implanted along with a moral nature. But
   the term sinfulness manifestly expresses far more than the mere
   possibility of sinning. Along with the latter, it is possible to form a
   conception of the free-will being in a state of perfect indifference to
   evil or good, and of a development from a condition of simple innocence
   to one of conscious virtue, without the intervention of sin. The
   former, on the contrary, presupposes a positive inclination to evil,
   from which there then arises actual sin. Hence, in acknowledging the
   possibility of sin in Jesus, we do not at all concede the existence of
   sinfulness, or even of the least trace of actual evil.

   It is a further question, whether, besides that possibility of sin
   which we necessarily attribute to a personal being as such, there was
   not in Jesus that bias towards evil which we term original sin? The
   answers given to this question vary, of course, according to the
   varieties of theological opinion. We merely evade, not solve, the
   difficulty, when we reply by affirming that there is no such thing as
   original sin,--when we assert that man enters life innocent, in the
   full possession of his moral powers, and that there is nothing in
   himself to prevent his development being perfectly pure, especially
   when circumstances are favourable. We cannot indorse this answer,
   because, as we have plainly declared in the first section, we recognise
   in human nature a prevailing inclination to sin. Neither are we able to
   agree to the view, that the result of this inclination is only that we
   labour under a difficulty of good,' [216] but possess also a freedom
   capable in each separate instance of deciding in favour of that which
   is right, and hence rendering a perfectly sinless development
   conceivable. For as soon as the moral power is regarded as one which
   has to contend with inward difficulties, a perfectly pure beginning is
   no longer possible, and an internal discord is assumed irreconcilable
   with that sinless development which we attribute to the Lord Jesus.

   On the assumption of universal sinfulness among men, there remains,
   therefore, no other way of accounting for the perfect purity of the
   life of Jesus, than by supposing that a creative Divine influence was
   at work in the origin of His personality. [217] Because God so willed
   and effected it, a new link was introduced by a direct creation into
   the chain of sinful life and the individual thus created was endowed
   with pure, fresh, and unblemished moral powers, in order that a
   perfectly holy, godly life might be first realized in Him, and then
   through Him in humanity. The objection, that the case is in this way
   transferred to the region of the miraculous, need not mislead us. The
   new commencement of moral and religious life in Christ is undoubtedly a
   miracle, and inexplicable save .on the assumption of direct Divine
   causality. The new thing, however, which is thus called into existence
   is not contrary to nature, but the re-establishment of nature in its
   original purity. [218] Besides, the origin of Christianity, and of all
   true religion in general, can only be explained on the condition that
   God should enter into real fellowship with humanity, and exert a
   creative influence on its development. This, again, is inconceivable,
   except on the supposition that the influence should manifest itself in
   a special manner in individual persons, and in every portion of the
   being of these persons. They who think they can explain the
   commencement, progress, and perfection of the religious life, and
   especially the origin of Christianity, apart from Divine agency,
   utterly misconceive its real nature.

   It has been objected, and with greater apparent force, that in this way
   we destroy the significance of the life of Jesus as an example to men.
   If Jesus was in His origin free from sinful taint through special
   Divine influence, and if He was endowed with new moral power by special
   Divine gift, He cannot be, it is said, in respect of His moral
   perfection, a true, binding example to those who are not similarly
   favoured. To this we reply: The doctrine that Christ is an example for
   our imitation, must first of all be rightly understood. It evidently
   does not refer to all that Jesus was and did. He had a work to perform
   of an utterly unique kind, which, in its turn, required and assumed a
   unique personality. In this work, none of course can imitate Him in
   such wise as to do a like work--as to be a like person. He can only be
   regarded as our example with reference to religion and morality in
   general, to His perfectly holy disposition and conduct;--and even in
   these respects, not in the sense that we are to be as He was, but in
   the sense that we ought to become like Him, to attain to a conformity
   to Him, to be transformed into His glorious image. [219] This is a goal
   nu ot to be reached at once, but one set before us throughout the whole
   course of our earthly existence, and even beyond its limits. Now Jesus
   could not be a perfect and universal example of this kind unless He
   were absolutely pure and holy; and this, again, would be impossible if
   any impediment to a perfectly normal development were found in the
   basis of His personality. On the other hand, it is asserted that none
   but one absolutely like ourselves in all things, the original
   inclination to sin not excepted, could really be an example to us. But
   if this be the case, we shall find ourselves obliged either to give up
   the idea of a really perfect example, or to demand that it should be
   given by one naturally incapable of so doing. Hence the choice left us
   is--either we have no perfect example, or we must admit that this was
   furnished by a personality who was even in his moral constitution
   extraordinary. We need the less scruple to accept the latter
   alternative, since in other spheres, also, parallel instances occur.
   [220] In those of poetry and art, that which is truly typical and
   classical is ever the production of minds of extraordinary endowment;
   yet it never strikes any one that these, if they are to be examples to
   others, must necessarily have worked their ways through all the
   hindrances and difficulties to which the rest of the world is subject.

   Again, it is argued, that 'so far as the virtue of Jesus was really
   human, there must have been a sensuous element in it, for no human
   virtue is quite free from such an admixture; but imperfection is
   involved in such a subjection to the law of our sensuous nature, and
   thus an end is put to any absolute moral perfection.' [221] There is
   undoubtedly an element of truth in this observation also. We cannot
   deny the presence, in the virtue of Jesus, of that sensuous admixture
   which gives the freshness of life to our own willing and acting. Body
   and spirit in Him were connected in the same manner as in other men.
   But there is nothing to justify the assertion that there is something
   intrinsically sinful in this sensuous element of our volitions and
   acts. Provided that the highest principle of our constitution, the
   spirit (pneuma), is the ultimate and decisive source of our volitions
   and acts, they are good, although either at their origin, or during
   their progress, the freshness and vigour of our purposes may be owing
   to an inevitable admixture of the sensuous element. The sensuous part
   of man's being is only evil when it sets itself in opposition to the
   higher, the pneumatic part. By branding it as essentially sinful, we
   necessarily bring an accusation against the Author of our nature. [222]
   But it is impossible to show that the sensuous impulses in Jesus were
   in any single case, to an unwarrantable degree, the moving spring of a
   determination of His will; or that, when called into natural play, they
   ever came into conflict with His higher nature. The general character
   of His words and acts is not passionate excitement, but the most
   deliberate calmness and self-possession. [223]

   Last of all, the objection has been raised from this side, that the
   feeling of humility in Jesus must have arisen from a consciousness of
   the imperfection and limitation of some minimum of sinfulness. Such a
   feeling is the means by which man frees himself from the guilt which
   cleaves to him: consequently Jesus was in this respect also our
   pattern, that He humbled Himself as a finite being before His heavenly
   Father.' [224] If we are to uphold the unity of the inward life and
   being of Jesus, we cannot admit this assertion; for the same Jesus who
   declared Himself free from all sin, who was certain throughout His
   whole life that He was glorifying the Father, could not have humbled
   Himself from any consciousness of imperfection; but only from that
   feeling of piety, which evidenced itself in perfect submission to God,
   and in loving condescension to man. And, in fact, humility does not
   arise from a consciousness of sin. To regard it in this light, would
   make it synonymous with the feeling of guilt. Humility really arises
   from that inward relation of an individual towards himself and others,
   which removes all over-estimation, all vainglory, even in the midst of
   the most evident superiority,--which does away with all efforts to
   exalt self and to dazzle others. It prompts, in its judgment and
   treatment of others, to a spirit of gentleness, appreciation, and
   kindly sympathy, so far as the interests of truth permit. In this sense
   only was Jesus humble; but in this He was a perfect model of humility.
   He laid claim to nothing for Himself, but received all that was given
   Him of the Father. He pleased not Himself, and would have none but God
   called good in the very highest sense. He never placed His own dignity
   in a conspicuous light, but sought, on the contrary, to conceal it. He
   made Himself as he that serveth, even to His disciples. He condescended
   to all, and was ever ready to cast the beams of His light and His love,
   not only on the meanest and weakest, but even upon the most sinful.
   Such humility by no means presupposes the presence of indwelling sin,
   and the necessity of freeing Himself from it, on the part even of
   Jesus, but is, on the contrary, quite consistent with perfect moral
   purity.

   Sec. 2.--Arguments drawn from the Nature of the Moral Idea.

   In the last place, a word must be said on the position taken with
   regard to the subject under consideration by modern speculative
   criticism. [225] This decidedly opposes the sinlessness of Jesus, and
   does so chiefly on philosophic grounds, i.e. upon such arguments as are
   derived from the nature of the moral idea and its development in
   humanity: we are therefore under the necessity of meeting these
   objections also.

   Modern speculation does indeed leave to Jesus a certain residuum of
   greatness, in virtue of which He was capable of being the occasion' of
   the rise of a new faith. Yet this greatness is of an indefinite kind,
   and in no case constitutes a specific distinction between Him and all
   other men. As a proof of this equality, two maxims are brought forward
   which are evidently regarded as fundamental axioms. One of these axioms
   is, that the first in a series of developments cannot at the same time
   be the greatest;' the other, that it is not the manner of the idea to
   realize itself in a single individual, but only in the sum-total of
   individuals,--in the genus.' If the first axiom held universally and
   necessarily true, we should be driven to conclude that the moral
   greatness of Jesus did not surpass the succeeding links of the chain of
   development realized in the Christian world and the relative eminence
   of Jesus, His character as our pattern, would thus be destroyed. But if
   the former axiom were shown to be inadmissible, and there remained only
   the second, this latter would, if applied to Jesus, at the least
   exclude the possibility of believing in His absolute moral greatness,
   and consequently do away with His typical relation to men.

   In both these propositions, individually considered, there is a certain
   amount of truth; but in the application made of them to the founder of
   Christianity, we find but another exemplification of the erroneous
   tendency of modern speculation to merge the particular in the general,
   the concrete in the abstract; and this tendency we cannot but decidedly
   oppose. It is perfectly correct to say that in certain spheres of life
   the first in a series of developments is not at the same time the most
   perfect,--the commencement is not also the fulfilment. But it is no
   less true that in other spheres the first of a series must be also the
   highest, as certainly as that there would be no development at all were
   it otherwise. For our present purpose, we shall distinguish between the
   spheres of science, of art, and of the moral and religious life. In the
   first department, all is dependent on the range of knowledge; in the
   second, on the inventive intuition of genius, and the distinctive
   capacity to give shape and form to that which is imagined; in the
   third, on the entire inner life, in so far as it takes up a special
   position to things human and Divine. Knowledge is by nature
   progressive, because, on the one hand, it is dependent on experience,
   whose circle is widened only gradually, and by the co-operation of
   many; and, on the other hand, because it is based on processes of
   thought, which become ever deeper in their course. Consequently, if
   this progress goes on unimpeded, the later inquirer ordinarily
   surpasses the earlier. Here the axiom mentioned previously, holds good
   as a general rule. It is not possible that one man should comprehend in
   himself all that can be known. Least of all can this be expected of him
   who is the pioneer in any special branch of science or knowledge. Every
   inquirer and knower is complemented by other inquirers and knowers. It
   ie. true that at certain epochs giant minds arise, which either unite
   the elements they find at hand in higher combinations, or sagaciously
   anticipate the future; but even they cannot pass beyond certain
   definite limits, and it cannot fail that some of those who follow after
   may gain a higher eminence. It is quite different even in the sphere of
   art. There only those individuals accomplish anything great who are
   endowed with special creative powers, and with remarkable talents of
   execution; there, the most important works owe their origin not to a
   co-operation of many, but to the intuitions and technical skill of
   individual genius. In this department, supposing that the masters who
   arise, possessed of higher genius, do form schools, they ordinarily
   surpass their scholars and successors, and thus, whilst first in the
   order of time, are also relatively the most eminent. It is even
   conceivable, that a master endowed with the very highest powers should
   produce works in his department, which remain pre-eminent and
   unequalled in all subsequent times. The case is different, again, in
   the matter of religion. Religion has indeed an element of knowledge in
   common with science, and one of intuition and representation in common
   with art; but in its inmost nature, it is a peculiar state of being
   affecting the whole life of man,--it is that reference of the life of
   the individual to God which governs every thought and action. Here the
   personality, as such, is all in all. Everything depends on the manner
   in which it stands inwardly related to God. To speak of the gradual
   introduction of an essentially new form, of a principle of religion, by
   the combined exertions of many, is almost preposterous; for the life,
   the consciousness, is not the joint product, the joint result of the
   efforts of a community, but must originally reside in One, from whom it
   then passes on to others. He through whom a new religious life and
   consciousness are produced in others, is the founder of a religion; and
   he will naturally be the most perfect, as well as the first, in the
   series of development of which he is the originating cause. Only once
   can a peculiar religious consciousness be said to dawn for the first
   time; only once can there be a really original religious life; and of
   necessity the life and consciousness will be present with the greatest
   freshness, purity, and energy in the spirit of him in whom they take
   their rise. He who should surpass the founder of the system to which he
   belongs, in the intensity and energy of his religious life and
   consciousness, would himself become the founder of a new religion, and
   be the first in a new series of developments.

   A speculative system which treats religion as a mode and branch of
   knowledge, and considers it, in contrast with philosophy, but an
   imperfect, elementary, childish knowledge, may find it very natural to
   conceive of piety as gradually progressing from a lower to a higher
   state (like all things else), and may consequently be unable to
   consider the founder of a religion as even relatively the greatest, for
   he is in its view only the occasion of its existence. But it is quite
   incredible that such should be the actual state of the case, because
   religion is not mere knowledge, and therefore its development is
   governed by totally different laws from those which hold good in the
   case of science. In one aspect, undoubtedly, religion may be classed as
   knowledge; that is, so far as it is a doctrinal system. On this side,
   religion may undergo a development through the co-operation of many.
   This is the domain of theological science, and in it the later may far
   surpass the earlier. But surely the more recent theological science is
   generally acknowledged to have gained at least one step,--to have
   established the principle, that religion is not properly knowledge,
   that Christianity is not originally a system of doctrine, and that the
   nature and functions of theology are quite distinct from those of
   religion. In religion there is ever an element which is primitive,
   underived, direct, which does not gradually arise, but is present
   perfectly, undividedly, and originally; and this is the case simply on
   account of its being life, consciousness, a peculiar state of the whole
   soul. No thought of individuals supplementing each other, especially
   when the institution of a religion is concerned, can possibly be
   entertained. If a new religion is to arise, that which constitutes its
   vitality must at first exist in a single individual. And if this has
   once been the case, there is neither room nor need for others to
   contribute aught else to this its essential foundation. Sound sense, on
   the contrary, will not fail to recognise in the originator of the new
   religious life the greatest in his own peculiar sphere; and in fact
   there is no historical religion which does not in this sense place its
   founder at the, head of its community. Moreover, a glance at actual
   history necessarily raises the question: If Christ is not to be
   considered the most perfect in that whole series of development, of
   which He was the first, who in the whole Christian world, during its
   successive ages, is to be regarded as having actually surpassed Him? A
   most expressive and intelligible silence is its only answer.

   Still Jesus might, as the founder of Christianity, have been the
   greatest within the Christian community, without being therefore
   absolutely perfect. We may admit that He is an example, without
   absolutely regarding Him as our prototype. Against the latter criticism
   urges, that it is not the manner of the idea to realize itself in one
   individual, and grudgingly to deny itself to the rest; it realizes
   itself in the totality of individuals, in the race. Consequently, where
   an individual is represented to be the absolute embodiment of the idea,
   there is a transference to it of that which properly holds good only of
   the genus, for the individual is but a symbol of the totality.' In this
   objection also there is an element of truth. The idea does undoubtedly
   realize itself in humanity as a whole. Otherwise what significance
   could we attach to the existence and development of mankind? But in
   order to get at the whole truth, the other side must be taken into
   consideration, namely, that the idea realizes itself in humanity only
   in and through individuals. So far from the former excluding the
   latter, it is not even conceivable without it. All development in
   humanity has its ground in personalities: the higher the sphere
   thereof, the more certainly is this true. All great men derive their
   chief significance and importance from the fact that their life is not
   something isolated, but that whilst itself having its foundation in the
   foregoing development of humanity, it passes over into and becomes part
   of the succeeding development. The more fully this can be affirmed of
   any person, the greater he is; and if there existed a spirit possessing
   the capacity to diffuse and expand its inner life till it should become
   the life of entire humanity, we should be under the necessity of
   esteeming it absolutely great.

   In connection, however, with the question as to the realization of the
   moral idea, everything will depend on the way in which we define the
   idea of humanity. The idea of humanity does not relate to any special
   sphere, such as that of science, or art, or political wisdom; nor can
   be said to have attained its realization in the perfection of any
   endowment which belongs exclusively to one of these spheres. The idea
   of humanity comprises in itself that which all men, as men, are bound
   to accomplish,--that for the performance of which, each, apart from his
   special talents, is endowed with the requisite capacities,--that which
   may be described as the universal task,--the task which all men, as
   such, are bound to accomplish, whatever other powers or gifts may have
   fallen to their share. Now this absolutely universal thing is religion
   and morality. These belong to all men alike,--make man in the full
   sense man, in relation first to himself, then to human society, and
   specially in the highest relation of all,--that, namely, to his holy
   Creator, Lawgiver, and Judge. If we recognise the highest aim of all
   humanity, and of every individual, to be the attainment of perfection
   in piety and morality, or, in other words, the state of perfect union
   with God, and the holiness which has its ground therein, we shall be
   driven to concede at once, either that this ideal perfect condition is
   never realized at all, or, that such realization takes place, first in
   the individual personality, and then, through it, in a greater or less
   number of individuals, but not in the race as such.

   The fundamental thought ever firmly embraced by modern criticism is,
   that the idea is by no means a something lying beyond actuality,--a
   mere ought,'--but that it necessarily enters into real existence. This
   is, moreover, equally the result of our conviction, that the idea of
   man, which we recognise as Divine, but which we can only regard in God
   as creative, would, if it remained unrealized, be but empty and unreal.
   For if the idea. of man originated with God, and if man must therefore
   have been conceived of as perfect, as fulfilling, and not in conflict
   with, his destiny,--if, moreover, we are necessitated to ascribe
   reality to the thoughts of God,--we must assume that the Divine idea of
   man will in some way, and at some time, arrive at realization. But
   where is the realization to be met with? Modern speculation points us
   to the race, to the totality of human individuals forming a complement
   to each other. But from this standpoint, though original sin is denied,
   it is confessed that, taken together, we are sinful and imperfect
   beings. [226] Whence, then, is the realization of the idea to come? A
   series of imperfect beings, even if it is continued indefinitely, can
   never produce one that is perfect; the totality of all sinful men will
   not originate one who is sinless. Religious and moral perfection is a
   thing complete in itself, and can never be attained by the supply on
   the part of one imperfect being of that which was lacking in others. It
   must either be perfectly and completely present, or not at all. If the
   individuals are not moral and religious, the race cannot be said to be
   so. [227] In this method we should be driven to look upon the idea as a
   thing which ought to be,--as a goal ever revolved about, but never
   attained; and a notion of this kind cannot be called, even by modern
   criticism, an idea at all, but a mere fiction.

   In maintaining that the idea bestows itself in its fulness on one
   individual,--a thing which we find, at all events, to be
   approximatively the fact in all departments, and specially in art,--we
   are far from implying that it is for this reason niggardly towards all
   other individuals: we mean, in truth, just the reverse. That special
   bestowment on one, is the commencement of the historical process by
   means of which alone it is possible for all the rest to become
   participators. It is eminently requisite that the idea should be
   realized in an individual, when a perfect manifestation of God is to be
   made, when a perfect atonement and deliverance are to be effected, and,
   by means of both, a perfect religion is to be established. If the
   establishment of any definite historical religion presupposes one who
   is the greatest as regards that stage of the religious life, one who is
   therefore a pattern, how much more must the establishment of the
   perfect religion presuppose one who is not only relatively the highest,
   but altogether perfect in the sphere of religion, and who is
   consequently our prototype! It is a sheer contradiction to call
   Christianity the absolute religion, and yet to declare its founder
   morally or religiously imperfect. The fundamental requirement of all
   religion is the union of God and man. This is allowed by modern
   speculation: but it makes the effecting thereof an infinitely light and
   easy matter by its pantheism, by its regarding God and man as directly
   one. But, apart from the objection, that union can only be spoken of as
   taking place between two objects essentially distinct from one another,
   the most important point of all is entirely lost sight of, viz. sin,
   which, wherever it exists, necessarily causes a separation between God
   and man. If the reality and significance of sin are admitted, union
   with God can only be conceived of as reunion, brought about by the
   breaking down and taking away of sin,--in other words, by atonement and
   redemption. But it is evident, again, that atonement and redemption, if
   they are to be accomplished by an individual, require the appearance at
   the head of the human race of one perfectly free from sin,
   well-pleasing to God, and in full communion with Him. Hence in this
   respect, also, we are reduced to a choice between two
   alternatives,--either religion is reduced to an unaccomplished ought,'
   or the religious idea was perfectly realized in its founder. But so far
   is the idea from being niggardly to others through its realization in
   one person, that, on the contrary, it is therein alone that efficient
   means exist for rendering the attainment of perfection possible to
   others, and for giving it the greatest possible extension.

   mention, on the one side, Strauss's Schlussabhandlung zum Leben Jesus
   and the christological portion of his Glaubenslehre, especially pp.

   [227] Julius Müller remarks very justly, in his Christian Doctrine of
   Sin, i. 265, that the moral idea demands complete realization--a
   realization that embraces all its fundamental aspects--in the life of
   the individual: it endures no division of the task; it does not allow
   one person to limit himself to the exercise of one virtue, and to leave
   to others to supplement him by the cultivation of the other virtues. It
   is one of the most flagitious attacks on the majesty of the moral idea,
   to refer its claims to a reciprocal compensation of men, which shall
   make up for the shortcomings of one by the virtues of the rest.' Schaff
   (On the Moral Character of Christ, p. 52) observes, that the
   realization of the idea in an individual is no more contradictory than
   its realization in the race,--that, on the other hand, what is true in
   the idea must necessarily be realized in individual life, and that all
   history points to such realization.'

INFERENCES FROM THE FOREGOING FACTS AND ARGUMENTS.
     __________________________________________________________________

   IF it is clearly established, in opposition to all the objections which
   have been raised, that Jesus Christ led on earth a life of sinless
   perfection, such a fact, being a realization of that which is best and
   highest in the sphere of human life, must be admitted to be in itself
   of incomparable importance. At the same time, however, this fact--as
   has been already hinted in the Introduction--is so constituted, that we
   cannot, as in the case of other extraordinary phenomena, stop at its
   simple admission. On the contrary, we shall find ourselves compelled to
   look both backwards and forwards from this point, and thus to reflect
   on its hidden reasons and connection. It will then quickly appear that
   we have here to do with a phenomenon of the most far reaching and
   widely influencing significance. [228] For sinlessness is manifestly a
   condition which cannot possibly occur as something isolated and
   disconnected: it presupposes the whole nature and character of the
   person of whom it is predicated, to be peculiar. Furthermore, it will
   not suffice, nor indeed shall we be able, to look upon the person whom
   we regard as thus peculiarly constituted as existing merely for
   himself: we shall be compelled to attach to him a significance for the
   whole human race. One so exalted above all who are sinners as to be
   absolutely perfect, must necessarily exist for all, and must, in all
   that he is and does, stand in a peculiar and important relation to the
   inner life of all. Thus the sinlessness of Christ is a central point
   from which light is shed on all sides, first upon the Person of Jesus
   Himself, to enable us more fully to know and understand Him; and then
   upon His position with regard to the human race, that we may be more
   capable of appreciating it.

   We started from the point, that perfect religion and the work of
   salvation could only be conceived of as personally effected, and that
   by a person who should be himself in perfect union with God, and
   therefore absolutely perfect. Hence we inferred that if a person proved
   to be thus absolutely perfect should really appear in the midst of the
   sinful human race, there would be every reason to believe that, in and
   through him, the perfect religion would have been manifested in a
   personal form, and the foundation laid for the salvation of mankind in
   all ages. We have now to apply this to Christ and His work. And in
   doing so, we shall naturally direct attention, first, to the Person of
   Christ, independently considered, and then to the position He occupies
   towards mankind. With regard to the first point, we shall have to show
   what are those inevitable inferences from the sinless holiness of
   Christ, which exhibit Him in all respects as One in whom the relation
   of man to God and of God to man, and therefore the religious life in
   all its purity, fulness, and power, was realized. With regard to the
   second, it will be our task to make it evident that conclusions which
   prove that it was Jesus Christ exclusively who obtained salvation for
   the whole race of man, cannot possibly be avoided. It is self-evident
   that, in the treatment of our subject, we shall not go into minute
   details concerning the Person and work of Christ. Our purpose will be
   answered by bringing forward those more general and fundamental
   features which are, on the one hand, more closely connected with our
   own starting-point, and which, on the other, may best subserve the end
   we have mainly in view, viz. to prove that Christianity is the divinely
   appointed and perfect way of salvation.

   [228] Dorner treats on the importance of the sinlessness of Christ in
   Christian apologetics, in his already so frequently quoted work, § 4,
   pp. 49-58. He well shows that, in proving the Divine authority of
   Christianity in these days, more stress is to be laid upon the miracle
   of love, manifested in the moral character of Christ, than in those
   miracles of power which have hitherto been more appealed to for this
   purpose, because the special and most essential nature of God is to be
   found rather in His holy love than in His omnipotence. But, true as all
   is which he advances from this point of view, it is to be regretted
   that the author should in this section have stopped at general
   allusions, instead of going into details.

CHAPTER I.

  SIGNIFICANCE OF SINLESSNESS WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSON OF JESUS.
     __________________________________________________________________

   JESUS CHRIST, viewed simply as a sinless and holy being, is undoubtedly
   a phenomenon of extreme significance, and must be admitted, on this
   account alone, to be invested with incomparable dignity and
   unimpeachable majesty. [229] But when this fact of sinless perfection
   is admitted, it is directly felt that this cannot, like many other
   qualities, be present only in one or in another condition of the mental
   life, but that it necessarily presupposes a totality of this life, from
   which it then springs forth as its best and loveliest blossom. Sinless
   perfection, being itself extraordinary, either requires, in the person
   in whom it is manifested, something else which is extraordinary, or
   will produce this as its natural consequence. If we would, however,
   know what this something else is, we must first of all learn it from
   the lips of Him who is Himself sinlessly perfect. For, apart from the
   consideration that, even in this respect, He alone could know with
   certainty who or what He was, His own statement on the matter must
   have, à priori, decided authority for us. Even in the case of a person
   distinguished for mental and moral eminence in a general sense, we
   should lay special stress upon such disclosures as he was pleased to
   make concerning himself; how much more, then, upon His, who is so
   supremely preeminent! But while, in the former instance, a claim to be
   somewhat extraordinary might seem to justify us in questioning and
   investigating the fact, the case is altered when this claim is made by
   one who, whether in living, dying, or suffering, proved Himself to be
   sinlessly perfect. When He who is holiness calls Himself also the
   Truth, and when He who has proved Himself to be the true Son of Man,
   represents Himself to be at the same time the Son of God, and ascribes
   to Himself a relation entirely peculiar with respect both to God and
   man, such a statement commands a reverential and believing acceptance,
   by virtue of the holiness of Him who makes it. It is in this sense that
   we may well lay down the axiom, that a perfectly holy being is that
   which He plainly and decidedly declares Himself to be. It is not,
   however, our purpose to appeal, in this case, to the sayings of Christ
   alone as valid authority, apart from any other consideration. On the
   contrary, we shall endeavour, at the same time, to prove that those
   inferences on which faith in Jesus Christ, in the sense intended, is
   grounded, are the natural consequences of His sinlessness.

   It must be always in a measure detrimental, in the case of a
   personality of essential unity, to represent it according to the
   several elements of which it is composed. The impression of
   dismemberment thus given is at variance with that organic connection
   with a common centre which really exists. And yet it is only by viewing
   an object, first in one, then in another, of its individual aspects,
   that we arrive at a comprehension of the whole. This method, then, must
   be pursued even in our contemplation of the Person of Jesus Christ, yet
   in such wise as to maintain our consciousness of the ever vital
   connection existing between its separate components. In this sense, but
   in this sense only, do we propose to contemplate, each by itself, the
   different sides of His Person, for the purpose of considering what
   light is thrown upon it by His sinless perfection. Our remarks, then,
   as is self-evident, will relate to those two chief sides of His nature,
   according to which our whole subject is divided,--to the human and the
   Divine, the Son of Man and the Son of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [229] The immeasurable pre-eminence of Jesus, as the absolutely perfect
   One, is shown especially in the fact that no delineation of His life
   and character can possibly exhaust its subject, and that His moral
   greatness does but appear the more exalted in proportion to the
   elevation attained in a moral sense by him who contemplates it. It
   might be said that, in this case, as in that of lofty mountains, the
   whole altitude is not apparent until the observer stands upon an
   opposite height. The comparison, however, fails, because it deals with
   an elevation which, after all, it is possible to attain and to measure
   while the moral eminence of Jesus, on the contrary, is a height ever
   unattainable by us. The absolute and majestic pre-eminence of the
   morals phenomenon presented by the life of Christ, as bearing on it the
   direct impress of the Divine, has been well brought forward by Ph. A.
   Stapfer in his Versuch eines Beweises der göttlichen Sendung and Würde
   Jesu aus seinem Charakter, Bern 1797, rendered into French in Vinet's
   Mélanges Philosophiques par Stapfer, Paris 1844, vol. ii. pp. 464-514:
   see especially pp. 467 and 493-95. To the two sublimities asserted by
   Kant, viz. the starry heavens above, and the moral law within us,
   Stapfer beautifully adds a third, viz. the fulfilment of the moral law
   without us, in the Person of Jesus Christ (p. 494, note 1). I would
   also refer the reader to Dandiran sur la Divinité du Caractère Moral de
   Jesus Christ, Geneva 1850.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sec. 1.--The Human Nature of Jesus.

   As we have seen at an earlier stage of our inquiry, although sin has
   its true home, its central abode in the will, yet it is not limited to
   this sphere of our being. On the contrary, the whole spiritual and
   physical life of man, though in varying proportions, is ever found in
   sympathy therewith. The same thing may be affirmed of sinlessness, only
   in an opposite direction. Wherever sinlessness is realized, it cannot
   at all be conceived merely as a quality of our volitions and actions
   alone, but must ever be regarded as inseparably co-existent with the
   perfect purity and full development of all the powers of our nature.

   This applies first to intellectual knowledge in matters which concern
   religion and morality. Such knowledge is not indeed the sole, nay, not
   even the highest and most prolific, element in the religious life; and
   yet it forms so essential a component thereof, that the existence of
   perfect religion in general is inconceivable apart from it. On the
   other hand, if the sinless perfection of any one person is proved, this
   will be the most valid and direct guarantee that he is possessed also
   of perfect and complete knowledge in the spheres of religion and
   morality.

   In this sense, above all, does Jesus express Himself. Even when
   speaking in general terms, He ever combines the knowledge of Divine
   truth with the moral condition. It is in the Sermon on the Mount [230]
   that we hear from His lips that great saying--Blessed are the pure in
   heart, for they shall see God,'--which lays down purity of heart as the
   fundamental condition of the highest, i.e. the intuitive knowledge of
   God, and, at the same time, regards the latter as the blessed effect of
   the former. Elsewhere He makes veracity of doctrine, and consequently
   that knowledge which must be its foundation, dependent upon the seeking
   not our own glory, but the glory of God; [231] and, consequently, upon
   a full surrender of ourselves to God. Again, He points out as the
   surest way of being convinced that His own doctrine was indeed from
   God, an earnest desire to do the will of God. [232] In other words, He
   says plainly enough, that in religion it is not he who desires only to
   know who will attain this end, but he alone who actually does the will
   of God as far as he yet knows it, and thus proves the moral sincerity
   of his efforts. Moreover, Christ makes the most direct application to
   His own case of that which has been here advanced. This He does rather
   more obscurely, when He declares the reason of His teaching by the
   Father, and of His continual abiding with the Father, to be, that He
   does always those things that please Him.' [233] He does this, however,
   in the very plainest manner, in that chief passage in which He chiefly
   testifies to His own sinlessness, [234] --Which of you convinceth me of
   sin?'--by immediately adding to these words, And if I say the truth,
   why do ye not believe me?' He here, with a certainty which leaves
   nothing to be desired, makes His sinlessness the pledge of the truth of
   His doctrine. Nay, we cannot but say, that to prove His doctrine to be
   truth, is, properly speaking, the very aim of His discourse; for He
   bears testimony to His sinlessness, not so much for the sake of this
   testimony itself, as for the purpose of thus authenticating Himself as
   the announcer of Divine truth. There would be no need, He seems to say,
   for your believing a sinner in things Divine; but you must of necessity
   acknowledge that one who can confidently appeal before God and man to
   the sinless purity of his life and character, cannot but be also a
   trustworthy and infallible witness. [235]

   The infallibility which the Lord Jesus thus simply claims in this
   concise but forcible manner, follows also from the very nature of the
   mental faculties. The human mind, however psychology may divide its
   powers and activities, is not really separated into different
   departments. It is absolutely one mind, though manifesting itself in
   various manners, and exerting itself in different directions. The
   threads of our whole intellectual` life are so subtly and inextricably
   interwoven, that every stroke (on one) strikes a thousand connected
   therewith;' that every influence from without affects the whole mind;
   and that in every action from within, each power of the mind in its
   measure participates. The man as thinking cannot be separated from the
   man as willing, nor the man as willing from the man as knowing. It is
   this indivisible unity of the mind which makes it inconceivable, that
   the same person should, with regard to religion and morality, be
   perfect as to volitions and acts, and defective as to knowledge. It is
   indeed very possible that the special talents belonging to some one
   department of life may, by a vigorous but one-sided cultivation, attain
   to a degree of development which is lacking to all the other mental
   powers. But it cannot hence be inferred that in the general department
   of the highest relations of human life, the practice may reach the
   degree of perfection, while knowledge remains in a state of
   imperfection. As sin here exercises a darkening influence on the
   reason, so, on the other hand, does purity of life secure purity of
   knowledge, while the latter is also the condition of the former. In
   fact, in this region there cannot be said to be a truth which belongs
   merely to one side. Whatever deserves the name, whatever is so called
   in holy. Scripture, is in reality life-truth,--truth in which the
   knowledge of God, and the desire to do His will, are by mutual
   interpenetration combined into a perfect unity. This being the case,
   the very existence of sinless perfection presupposes an infallibility
   of knowledge in things religious and moral, and therefore a freedom
   from all error. [236] Hence we are justified both in inferring the
   former from the latter, and in regarding sinlessness in purpose and
   action as a pledge of the absence of all error in knowledge and
   doctrine;--to which must indeed be added, that this can, in fact, be
   fully applied to none but Him who, alone of the whole human race, has
   made good the claim to absolute perfection.

   That Jesus was fully conscious of possessing such infallible knowledge
   of things religious and moral, is obvious from the very manner of His
   teaching. We read in the Gospels that He taught them as one having
   authority, and not as the scribes; [237] that the people were
   astonished at His teaching; [238] that the officers sent by the priests
   and Pharisees to apprehend Him testified, Never man spake like this
   man;' [239] and that the Apostle Peter exclaimed in the name of his
   fellow apostles, Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of
   eternal life.' [240] Is it asked in what did the power of His words
   consist? We reply, not in the force, beauty, or perfection of diction,
   which may in other cases make human eloquence powerful and influential;
   for, however appropriate even the very words of Christ, in all their
   abundant variety, may be, artistic effect is the very last thing to be
   thought of in this connection. On the contrary, their power lay
   entirely in the fact that they were in perfect unison with His
   personality, and that this personality was of a nature which made His
   words incomparably important as to their matter, and powerfully
   affecting as to their form.

   The teaching of Jesus was no delivery of lectures on the general truths
   of religion and morality, but the living testimony of facts and
   realities. The fact that the kingdom of God had already come, its
   nature, constitution, and future prospects, and, above all, His own
   position therein as its Head and King, as He in whom the Father was to
   be glorified, and the human race to find redemption,--such was the main
   purport of His teaching. Its manner, however, was that of
   self-testimony and self-manifestation. This is the reason that it
   exhibits nothing of sudden and violent exultation, no unexpected bursts
   of enthusiasm, but always that same peace, and that same undisturbed
   tranquillity, by which His actions were also pervaded. There is,
   however, another feature, which may be regarded as its most distinctive
   mark; and this is, its absolute elevation above all that is uncertain
   and problematical,--its utter exclusion of all doubt or hesitation, On
   the contrary, it claims a supreme authority, and is supported by a
   certainty and confidence on the part of Him who imparts it, which we
   meet with in no other teacher. There is in it a tone of Divine
   demonstration which, notwithstanding the humility of the speaker,
   declares that that which He advances is perfectly unanswerable. When
   the external effect of such a manner of teaching is considered, we are
   constrained to acknowledge that, viewed in conjunction with the
   indwelling truth and saving power of His announcements, it must have
   given to the words of Jesus the greatest possible emphasis, and have
   secured for them the most abundant results. When regarded, however,
   with respect to the teacher Himself; such a mode of instruction could
   only be justified and explained in the case of one in immediate and
   secure possession of that which He announced,--of One who spoke that
   which He knew, and testified that which He had seen. [241] None but one
   perfectly sinless could thus have spoken. Teaching of this kind,
   whether we consider its matter or manner, would, in the mouth of a man
   that was a sinner, have been the grossest presumption. But from the
   lips of Him whose life was one uninterrupted communion with God, it was
   both the natural and necessary expression of His inmost nature, of His
   entire personality. If testimony, powerful in itself, and capable of
   resounding through the whole world, was to be given concerning a higher
   state of things, this could have been done only as Jesus did it; but,
   on the other hand, none could have so given it, but One who, in virtue
   of His sinless perfection, was an unerring witness in things pertaining
   to God.

   That which has been advanced is not, however, important with regard
   only to the intellectual side, but is equally applicable to the
   emotional and imaginative powers, nay, even to the physical basis of
   life, to the whole man in general. In all these respects, sin, on the
   one hand, proceeds from a spurious excitement which both disturbs and
   destroys the true unity of life, and, on the other, begets such an
   excitement in an aggravated form. With sinlessness, on the contrary, an
   entirely opposite process takes place. We cannot conceive of
   sinlessness otherwise than in conjunction with a simple and harmonious
   movement of the feelings, with a pure and spotless activity of the
   imagination, and with a condition of physical life in which the spirit
   that rules the whole man finds its appropriate expression, and a
   well-ordered and sufficient instrument, for the execution of its higher
   aims and purposes. It will. be, moreover, wherever it exists, the
   foundation for an undisturbed and healthy development of the life in
   all these aspects. Sinless perfection can only grow from a life whose
   whole condition, and all whose functions are in every respect pure. Of
   such a life it is the noblest fruit. And while it is thus the natural
   result of such a state, it becomes again, in its turn, the power which
   maintains the entire life in health and purity.

   It was precisely this which was exemplified in the historical
   manifestation of Him whom we know as the only sinless man. Jesus
   participated in every human feeling, from the most powerful to the
   tenderest, and appreciated such feelings in others in the most open and
   delicate manner. At the grave of Lazarus He wept with them that wept,
   and at Cana He rejoiced with them that rejoiced. His indignation
   overflowed against the Pharisees and the desecrators of the temple,
   while He ever manifested the tenderest compassion towards all who were
   in need of His help. He exhibited in presence of His enemies a heroic
   readiness for conflict, and to His friends a love willing to lay down
   life for their sake. In all His sorrow, however, as in all His joy,
   there was no worldly element, but that deep and Divine seriousness
   which gave to every emotion its due proportion. His indignant zeal
   never degenerated into violence, because it was aroused for the honour
   of God, and His pity never sank to weakness, because it aimed at the
   real good of those who craved His assistance. And as even on the cross
   He had thoughts of peace for His bitterest foes, so, when truth
   demanded it, He had words of sharp rebuke for His nearest friends. His
   every emotion and every frame of mind, Moreover, bore the impress of
   holy purity, while peace, which was the distinctive mark of His whole
   nature, was shed forth over all.

   Such, too, was the case with respect to everything belonging to the
   sphere of the imagination. We perceive from His discourses how truly
   and clearly He had stored up in His mind the phenomena of nature, and
   the various conditions of human life and how all these were at His
   command for the freest and most varied use. [242] It is, moreover, from
   the very use He makes of these in figures, parables, etc., that we
   perceive how pure must have been the springs of that soul in which all
   was thus reflected, and then formed into the aptest vehicle for the
   conveyance of eternal truths. If the material is derived from nature,
   it is always those simple, every-day objects most familiar to men's
   senses which serve as the foundation, while their treatment manifests
   the utmost originality, and the finest and most genuine feeling for
   what is natural. If, on the other hand, it is taken from human life, it
   is always its great and ever-recurring events which are invoked, and
   all is so represented that these appear in their actual and genuine
   nature, and are called by their right names; so that in the very
   figure, apart from its application, we already find a purifying and
   enlightening power. Nowhere do we recognise anything far-fetched,
   distorted, or variable; on the contrary, we everywhere feel that nature
   and human life have been viewed with a divinely correct and single eye,
   which has derived from them whatever seemed adapted for expressing and
   conveying Divine truth. And when this truth is thus popularized, and in
   the noblest sense embellished, we are at the same time fully impressed
   with the fact, that the reason why it was thus expressed was not to
   polish or beautify it, but to bring it to bear with the most striking
   effect and the greatest power upon those who heard it. [243]

   History offers but very little in the shape of fact, to enable us to
   say anything definite concerning the physical condition and appearance
   of Jesus. Hence arose the possibility that very different, and indeed
   opposite, views could be entertained on the subject at an early period
   of Church history. One of these views maintained the perfect beauty of
   His external appearance; the other asserted that He was deficient of
   all beauty, and even unsightly. These views being, however, supported
   only by inadmissible applications of passages from the Old Testament,
   [244] are of no special importance. Yet, even in this respect, we are
   not without grounds for more tenable conclusions, especially if we take
   into consideration the inseparable connection between the external and
   the internal. Sound natural sense will always take for granted that the
   intrinsic dignity of the Lord Jesus was expressed in His external
   appearance; and that though it might seem incongruous to attribute to
   Him a dazzling beauty, yet we may well picture Him to ourselves as
   possessing a comely and dignified exterior, calculated both to inspire
   reverence and to awaken confidence. In fact, it is self-evident that a
   mind of so unique a character must have set its mark, as such, even
   upon His countenance; and equally so, that the office undertaken by our
   Lord justifies the supposition that His body was in all respects an
   instrument perfectly adapted for its accomplishment. In this aspect, we
   have also a right to insist especially upon a perfectly pure and moral
   physical development as an element of decided importance with respect
   to our subject. If there ever existed a personality of whom it might be
   said that the integrity and well-being of even the bodily organization
   were preserved by the power of the moral element, and that the
   corporeal itself was transfigured by the spiritual, it was in the case
   of Him who was sinlessly perfect. His body was indeed, and in the
   fullest sense of the term, the temple of the Holy Ghost; [245] and we
   cannot possibly conceive that which so justly deserves to be called a
   temple of God as aught else than a form of majesty and dignity.
   Besides, certain undeniable facts testify that we do not err in drawing
   such a conclusion. On the one hand, there is the powerful impression
   ever made upon all kinds of people, and under every variety of
   circumstances, by the mere appearance and presence of the Lord Jesus.
   On the other hand, there is the manner in which He indisputably did
   accomplish His mission, with all its self-denial, exertions, and
   conflicts,--a fact utterly incomprehensible, even in its physical point
   of view, without a corresponding amount of bodily health and vigour.

   Thus in Jesus, the sinless One, we have, in every respect, the model of
   a perfect man. And that designation, Son of Man,' which He so often
   applied to Himself, though used chiefly in another sense and with
   reference to His Messianic office, may yet most rightly be bestowed
   upon Jesus, as expressing also, that in Him all that was truly human
   was as clearly impressed as was necessary, if the Divine favour were to
   rest upon Him, and if a type and example of the true position of man
   with respect to God were to be given. The sinless and perfect Jesus was
   the Son of Man, bearing every feature of humanity, but imparting
   thereto a Divine glory; enduring every human sorrow, but rising
   superior to all; entering into the very depths of human weakness, yet
   elevating human nature to a height far surpassing its native powers.

   Besides these general features of His human nature, there is another
   and special feature inseparable from His whole agency and
   manifestation, which we must not omit to bring forward. This
   characteristic is one which is not only of the greatest importance in a
   general point of view, but which, when contemplated from that of His
   sinless perfection, becomes specially significant, and has much light
   thrown upon it. We mean the miraculous element in the manifestation of
   Jesus, upon which we now propose to add a few words.

   The miraculous feature running through the whole manifestation of Jesus
   Christ, stands in very close connection with His sinless perfection. To
   be convinced of this, we have only to take a just view of the relation
   existing between them. We might entertain some scruples--especially in
   an argument intended for the present times--in making the miracles
   which Jesus performed, or which were accomplished in Him, the
   foundation of our faith in His mission and Person. But the case is
   different when, from reasons found in Himself and His actions, we
   recognise Him of whom so much that is miraculous is related, to be
   absolutely holy. Then miracles appear as only a further consequence of
   that peculiarity already involved in His personality as such they are
   but the expression of the same fact in a physical, which sinlessness is
   in a moral sense. And far from being either a stumbling-block or
   offence, their absence, in the case of such a Being, would, on the
   contrary, be regarded as a deficiency. But we must more closely explain
   our meaning.

   The appearance of one sinlessly perfect in the midst of a sinful race
   is itself a miracle. For thus the continuity of that sin which is
   everywhere perceptible is broken through, and a new beginning, a
   perfectly original creation, introduced. And if the essence of a
   miracle be the appearance, in the ordinary course of nature or history,
   of something totally new, which can only be referred to a Divine
   causality, such a feature is found in this instance in its full
   completeness. Nay, we may even call this appearance the supreme
   miracle--the miracle of miracles. [246] For while other miracles are
   wont to recur, this moral miracle appears but once in history. Nor is
   it merely a miracle of power, but a miracle of holy love; and hence,
   not accomplished by one single transaction, but only through the
   sacrifice of an entire life passed till its very last breath in a
   manner well-pleasing to God. With this prime and fundamental miracle,
   moreover, the principle of ate miraculous in general is combined with
   the Person and life of Jesus Christ; and we cannot but expect unique
   and extraordinary acts and events in the case of One who was Himself
   thus unique and extraordinary. And first, this is true of the Person of
   Jesus, independently considered. The connection ordained by God between
   sin and sorrow, and especially between sin and death, had no
   application to Him, for the very reason that in Him was no sin. Death
   could not have had the same significance for Him as for those who are
   subject thereto, because they are sinners. If He then suffered death,
   He could not suffer it as the wages of sin; nor could it have the same
   power over Him as over sinners. In this sense, His resurrection stands
   in the very closest connection with His freedom from sin. [247] And if
   this miracle, on which so much depends, is certainly regarded in
   Scripture as pre-eminently the work, of God in Jesus, we shall be
   constrained, at the same time, to acknowledge that this very act of
   Divine power has its hidden cause in the Person of Jesus
   Himself,--namely, in the fact that He was in truth the Holy One of God,
   [248] and that, as such, He already possessed perfect life in Himself.
   [249]

   But what has been said applies also to the miracles which Jesus
   performed on others. Sinless holiness naturally presupposes a freedom
   and power of will, a purity and fulness of vital energy, in virtue of
   which we should infer in Him in whom it was found, a power of reacting
   upon His own physical nature, and of exercising an influence upon the
   nature of other men, and of the world around Him, such as we could not
   believe possible in the case of those whose minds and wills were
   enslaved by sin. [250] At the same time, it is a self-evident notion to
   every one who seriously believes in the existence of a personal God,
   ever carrying on His operations in the world and in mankind, that this
   God will communicate Himself with infinitely greater fulness and
   abundance where constant intercourse with Himself is found, and vital
   fellowship with Himself is undisturbed by any kind of sin, than where
   sin has separated between Him and His creature. Such communication,
   moreover, will not consist merely of gifts for the benefit of the inner
   life, but also of powers, by the employment of which it may be shown
   how the Omnipotent manifests Himself--not only in His moral
   perfections, but in His control over nature--in His perfect image on
   earth.

   The sinless nature of Jesus was at the same time the source of His
   perfectly consistent use of miraculous power. In this respect, also, it
   was holy love which ever determined Him; and this quality is so clearly
   impressed upon His miracles, that even if no other tokens thereof were
   bestowed upon us, we might in these alone recognise its distinctive
   characteristics. Here, too, as everywhere, Jesus was the merciful,
   condescending, and self-sacrificing Saviour, untiring in His offices of
   love to the meanest and most wretched, even when of ten that were
   healed, one only showed any gratitude. [251] Yet, even when He stooped
   the lowest, all that He did ever kept the highest aim in view,--all was
   directed towards the glory of God and the salvation of man. He ever
   turned attention from Himself to the Father who had given Him such
   works to do and even when He bestowed bodily healing or temporal
   benefits, the higher and eternal blessing was ever His special and
   ultimate aim. It was this which formed the background, so to speak,
   both of each separate miracle, and of all His miracles viewed as a
   whole, the purpose of which was to secure and support the introduction,
   and furnish the foundation of the whole work of salvation.

   These are the chief points in which the sinlessness of Jesus affects
   His personality, viewed on its human side. In this aspect He shows
   Himself to be, in all respects, and especially in His position towards
   God, a perfect man, who being in His ow% inner nature a miracle, is
   also surrounded by the miraculous, whether in the deeds which He
   wrought, or in the lot which He submitted to. But it is this perfect
   man, thus gifted with miraculous powers, who, in the most decided
   manner, directs us to something beyond Himself--something still higher
   in His own Person: hence this Jesus cannot be the perfect Son of Man,
   unless He is also, what He declares Himself to be, the Son of God. It
   is in this sense that we now proceed to consider the sinlessness of
   Jesus with respect to His Divine nature.

   Sec. 2.--Inferences in respect to the Divine Nature of Jesus.

   The Christian Church, in all its genuine branches, confesses and
   teaches, besides the true humanity, the proper Divinity of Christ, and
   has from its earliest days laid down, in very definite formulae, the
   manner in which the Divine and human natures are inseparably united,
   and yet distinct, in the Person of the God-man. To test these formulae,
   or even to enter into any general examination of them, is beside our
   purpose, which aims rather at an apologetic than a doctrinal treatment
   of our subject. On the other hand, it is, however, quite in keeping
   with this, to direct attention to the fact that the article of faith
   which is now in question is not a matter of merely ecclesiastical or
   doctrinal detail, but one founded upon primitive evangelical testimony.
   It rests, moreover, not on the testimony of the apostles only, but on
   that of Jesus Himself. In this last respect, then, to treat of the
   internal verification of this testimony, is to deal with a matter which
   has a very decided bearing upon the sinlessness of Jesus. And here we
   would, first of all, call attention to the following facts: how the
   Lord Jesus, with a confidence raised above the very slightest degree of
   hesitation, makes Himself the central point of His work of redemption,
   the object of saving faith, and the beginning and end of His mission.
   He attributes to His death the most wide-reaching results for all
   mankind, and combines with His own exaltation the sending of the Holy
   Ghost. He institutes baptism as the sacred act by which all nations are
   to become His disciples, and the Lord's Supper as a celebration of His
   death until His coming again. He says of His words, that though heaven
   and earth shall pass away, they shall not pass away. If, then, no other
   particulars of His life were known to us than these, we should even
   then be constrained to infer that He was assuredly conscious of being
   more than man. In all this, the limits of the human are far surpassed;
   for it is absolutely unbecoming in any created being to make himself an
   object of faith, an object of religion and religious worship, and to
   place his own person in such a position with regard to the salvation of
   the whole human race, as Jesus undoubtedly does.

   Besides, it is no less certain to all unprejudiced minds, that He
   ascribes to Himself in plain terms, besides human existence, a nature
   superhuman, heavenly, and Divine. And this not only in sayings recorded
   in St. John's Gospel, but also in sayings essentially agreeing with
   these in the other three Gospels. The very manner in which He calls God
   the Father' His Father, points to a relation of a peculiar kind; still
   more so, that in which He represents Himself as Son of God,'--not as a
   son, but as the Son, in a sense unparalleled; for it is only He, as
   being this Son, who fully knows the Father, and is, on His part, fully
   known by Him. [252] All true knowledge of the Father is brought about
   by Him alone, and no man cometh to the Father but by Him. [253] The
   Father is glorified in Him, and He in the Father. [254] He that seeth
   Him seeth the Father; nay, He and the Father are one. [255] Moreover
   He, in the most decided manner, attributes to Himself Divine attributes
   and operations: an existence before the world was, in and with God,
   [256] --the office of judging the world,--the power of quickening whom
   He will. [257] In the institution of baptism, He connects His own name
   with that of the Father, and that of the Holy Ghost; and at His
   departure from the world, He announces to His disciples that all power
   is given Him both in heaven and in earth, and that He will be with them
   alway, even to the end of the world. [258] In short, He represents
   Himself as One who, from the beginning to the close of His earthly
   existence, participates in and experiences all that is human, but who,
   at the same time, bears within Himself the fulness of the Divine nature
   and life.

   What, then, is the relation between this self-testimony of Jesus and
   the doctrine of His sinlessness? Evidently this: that if there are good
   grounds for accepting the latter, there must be equally good grounds
   for believing the former. The two must stand or fall together. He who
   was perfectly pure and sinless, and who must therefore have been most
   moderate and conscientious, could never have affirmed aught concerning
   Himself of so supremely exalted a character, unless He had felt a
   certainty, surpassing every other certainty, that such pre-eminence was
   indeed His own. Besides, the bare fact that a being actually appeared
   who, on the one hand, assumed such a position with respect to God and a
   higher world, and, on the other hand, displayed such mental and moral
   sublimity, is inexplicable, on moral or psycho-logic grounds, unless
   this position to God and a higher world be a true and genuine fact. The
   reverse would indeed be far more incomprehensible. It would be a mental
   aberration, to estimate whose greatness no standard could be found, and
   utterly incompatible with every established fact of a mental and moral
   kind, which has been handed down to us concerning the Lord Jesus. If,
   in this highest of all respects, either self-delusion or wilful
   deception of others were found, such an error would be one which must
   necessarily pervade the whole nature of Jesus; and, in this case, far
   from being the sinlessly perfect One of the Gospels, He could not be
   the mentally and morally exalted character which even rationalism
   esteems Him, but something for which the correct expression has yet to
   be invented.

   Nevertheless, in this respect also, it is not our purpose to appeal to
   the expressions Christ Himself as our sole authority. Here, too, the
   doctrine of His sinlessness furnishes an internal proof of the doctrine
   in question, which, in an apologetic point of view, must be by no means
   overlooked.

   In our contemplation of the moral phenomenon presented by the life of
   Jesus, we saw that there was everywhere originality and absolute
   independence, that it exhibited a harmony in which all the antagonisms
   of human existence were reconciled. A life of such perfection gives a
   direct impression of being the result of a Divine operation. Where the
   human is the only element, we ever meet with some measure of dependence
   and imperfection, some conflict between flesh and spirit, some
   antagonism between the intellectual and the moral, or some other
   disproportion or irregularity. Where, however, we find the reverse of
   all this, we already discover in this very fact a trace of the Divine.
   To this same inference are we also led by that quality which we
   recognised to be the principle of the life of Jesus. This principle is
   holy love. Now holy love constitutes the nature of God Himself; hence,
   in the same proportion in which this principle is found to be present
   and effective in a personality, are we constrained to conceive God
   Himself to be present. Consequently, where a perfect manifestation of
   holy love takes place, there must we believe also in a perfect
   indwelling of God.

   But to say this, might seem to be affirming a principle of gradation,
   which might in its application to the Lord Jesus exhibit Him as merely
   possessing in the highest degree that which others shared in their
   measure. We perceive, however, in Him something besides, and that a
   thing entirely peculiar,--even the grand peculiarity of His sinless
   holiness. Others may be found truly pious, glowing with holy love, and
   in whom, therefore, God's more abundant presence must be assumed; but
   we do not meet with one who is sinless,--one who, absolutely conscious
   of His sinlessness, succeeds in making Himself acknowledged as
   such,--however carefully we may scan the boundless field opened before
   us by the history of the known races of men. An explanation, then, of
   this absolutely unparalleled phenomenon [259] is required, and this
   leads us to recognise in Jesus Christ a relation to God which, as well
   as the effects resulting therefrom, must be regarded as of an entirely
   exceptional kind.

   By viewing sinlessness as an attribute of the human nature of Jesus, we
   have maintained the notion that a human development characterized by
   perfect purity is possible, because neither human nature, considered
   simply as such, nor the idea of development, necessarily involves any
   element of sin. But then the question arises: If this be the case, how
   comes it that experience furnishes only one example of freedom from
   sin? Why have not others of the human race risen up from time to time,
   making the same claim, and compelling their fellow-men to acknowledge
   their pretensions? Why is there not at least one besides Jesus, who had
   the same faith in himself, and was able to beget it in others? This
   cannot be the result of accident. The reason must be, that sinlessness,
   though not unattainable by human nature, as such, is not, neither has
   been, nor can be, attained by man in his present state, because sin has
   gained a mastery over the whole human race, by virtue of which it is
   not possible for man, by his own unaided powers, to maintain a perfect
   freedom therefrom. But if man's own strength is not sufficient for
   this, it can only be effected by a power which is exalted above the
   sphere where sin prevails, and which, notwithstanding, enters into that
   sphere without contracting defilement; and this is precisely the Divine
   power. Consequently, when we meet with a man who has actually proved
   himself sinless in his conduct, we have grounds for inferring that a
   Divine power has in the fullest sense been operating within him,--that
   here is one who was indeed man, but who was also more than man.

   But this point must now be more fully elucidated. If all men are
   sinners,--and, with the exception of the Holy One of the Gospel, not
   even one is sinless,--it is a plain proof that a principle of sin, is
   implanted in human nature, not indeed by original constitution, but,
   certainly in its present state, that sin, although not the true, is
   still the second nature of man, that it pervades and rules the whole
   race. The principle of sin being in such a manner ingrafted in human
   nature in the condition in which experience presents it to us, only one
   supposition can render intelligible the existence of a sinless
   man,--namely, that the chain of sin has been broken, and that, in
   consequence, a personality has arisen in the midst of the sinful race,
   endowed with perfect soundness, with powers thoroughly pure, and amply
   sufficient for leading a life entirely in accordance with the will of
   God. But this is only possible as the result of a Divine creation. Such
   a person could not be the product of a race infected with sin. In this
   aspect, He in whom there really was the possibility of being sinless,
   is a totally new man, the second Adam. He is that Person in whom a new
   beginning of the higher life was to be made, and from whom a new race,
   a race new in this sense, might proceed.

   But the moral development and office of this second Adam evidently
   differ from those of the physical ancestor of the human race. He was
   not, like the latter, introduced in a state of full consciousness into
   a world as yet untouched by sin, but was born as an unconscious infant
   into a world in. which sin had already become a power. In this world He
   was not, for His own sake alone, to preserve in its purity the yet
   unspotted Divine image, but to restore to mankind, by His conquest of
   sin, that image which had been lost or obscured. In the same proportion
   as the task set before Him was incomparably higher, was the difficulty
   of accomplishing it infinitely greater. This difficulty lay chiefly
   herein: that a human life was to be developed in perfect purity from
   its very earliest stages, and that, nevertheless, this development
   could only take place in the midst of a sinful. world. If the soul had
   entered at once into conscious possession of its freedom, it might have
   been capable of directly waging war against all that was carnal and
   sinful, and of carrying on such war to a successful issue. But the
   moral, as indeed the whole mental life in man, as now born into the
   world, comes forth in the midst of a state at first unconscious, then
   semi-conscious and half dark, and but gradually attaining to the full
   light of complete consciousness. Under these conditions, if sin comes
   upon him from his surroundings, it gains possession of him before he
   knows it; and when he has attained to fuller moral consciousness, it
   has already obtained a footing in some form or other. [260] Thus
   perfect sinlessness is excluded, and a development perfectly free from
   sin is inconceivable, under the given circumstances, by merely human
   means. But if, as we have found in Jesus, such a development has,
   notwithstanding, been brought to pass, we ought not to feel any
   hesitation in assuming the presence of something over and above, and in
   union with, the integrity of constitution originally given. In Him
   whose development was thus sinless, there must have been an infallible
   sureness, enabling Him during its whole course, and even at those
   stages of it when He was not as yet awakened to full consciousness, to
   reject everything impure, untrue, and sinful, and to appropriate for
   His inner life only the pure, true, and good, from that which the
   surrounding world presented to Him. If we regard this merely as the
   result of a Divine care, operating from without, of a continuous Divine
   agency, we could not then understand why God should have suffered His
   grace to be thus efficient in this one Person only, and not in others
   also. Besides, we should thus be assuming that, in the case of Jesus,
   sin was ever on the point of breaking forth, and was only repressed by
   a Divine influence exerted from without. Our only reasonable course,
   then, is to conceive it as the result of a principle which acted from
   within. And indeed only such a principle could have worked with the
   required infallible certainty, and have separated and rejected the
   sinful as something alien and hostile to its own nature. It must
   therefore be conceded, that a Divine principle conditioned the original
   integrity of Jesus, and was a constituent element of His personality,
   which, developing in perfect harmony with the human element, did not
   hinder, but on the contrary favoured, the natural progress of the
   latter, and maintained its perfect purity. Clearly, however, we cannot
   understand by this Divine principle merely something akin or bearing a
   resemblance to God, such as is in every man; for sin can, and actually
   does, co-exist therewith in every man. We must therefore conceive it as
   the Divine in its uncorrupted and true essence. In this way we are led
   from the sinless Son of Man to the Son of God, and the recognition of
   the pure humanity of Jesus ends in the conviction of His true Divinity.
   [261]

   Summing up all together, we may say then, Jesus was sinless as a man,
   for the idea of sinlessness is only applicable to human nature; not,
   however, in the general sense of the term, man, not, in short, as a
   mere man,' but as the man, in whom the humanity was on the one hand
   endowed with extraordinary powers, and on the other hand was pervaded,
   animated, and energized by a Divine principle. In a word, He was
   sinless, because He was the second Adam, and the God-man. Only in
   virtue of the former condition was a development in any sense, and
   therefore a sinless development, possible to Him: only in virtue of the
   second could He accomplish it in face of a world full of evil, and
   which on all hands enticed Him to sin. Thus, although His sinless
   holiness was a quality of the human nature of Jesus, it had its proper
   roots in His character and essence as God-man. From His sinlessness,
   therefore, we may equally infer His pure and perfect humanity and His
   true Divinity; and inasmuch as we can only conceive of both as in
   complete unison and interpenetration, we infer further that He is
   God-man.

   Such are the inferences with respect to the Person of Jesus resulting
   from His sinlessness. The peculiarity of His moral character and
   conduct in the midst of a sinful world, testify, as well as His own
   assertions, that in Him we have to recognise a Person in whom God and
   man are entirely one;--a Person, therefore, who on one side as much
   commands our reverent adoration, as on the other He stands before us as
   the pattern of a perfect life in and before God. That the last and
   highest stage--so far as the personal realization of the perfect
   religion is concerned--is thus attained, is self-evident; for in this
   respect nothing can surpass the indwelling of God in human nature
   undisturbed by sin, and a human life passed in the spotless purity
   resulting from union with God, and terminated by an act of supreme
   self-sacrifice.

   The question, however, which now arises, is, how far--if Christianity
   is proved to be the perfect religion--did this Person furnish and
   accomplish all the conditions essential to the true and eternal
   salvation of the sinful human race? In this respect also, as we shall
   proceed to show, most important conclusions may be deduced from the
   sinlessness of Jesus.

   [259] Pelagianism denies that Jesus was an utter exception in a moral
   point of view. It is therefore driven to maintain that it is possible
   for other men to be sinless. If it was possible for Jesus in His human
   nature to remain sinless, it must also be possible for others, inasmuch
   as, according to the Pelagian doctrine, all men enter life with their
   moral powers in perfect integrity. Even if Christ were the only example
   of sinless perfection hitherto seen, there is no reason why there may
   not arise another like Him in the course of time. This particular view
   is connected with the entire Pelagian conception of Christianity, in
   which the idea of the Redeemer is left quite in the background, and
   example and doctrine alone are considered to be essential. Along with
   Pelagianism, Nestorianisin has been reproached with holding the same
   view: this was so, at all events, in the West, where it was supposed to
   be connected with Pelagianism. It was argued, that if the Divine and
   human natures are distinct, and holiness and sinlessness are regarded
   as the privilege only of the human nature, it follows that other men
   may attain the same moral elevation, without special communion with
   God. Compare Gieseler's Ecclesiastical History, Pt. i. § 86, especially
   the Observ. p. 447. This was, however, an inference from his doctrine,
   which Nestorius would never have conceded; for he did not in reality
   maintain such a separation of the Divine and human, and the presence of
   such a complete moral power in human nature in its present condition,
   as that deduction presupposes. It is a remarkable fact, that a renowned
   teacher of the ancient Church, the father of orthodoxy, Athanasius,
   seems, although from an utterly different point of view, to assume the
   sinlessness of other human individuals besides Jesus. He says not only
   generally, ex arches me`n ouk en kaki'a; oude` ga`r oude` nun en tois
   agi'ois esti'n, oud' o'lois kat' auton upa'rchei au'te (Contra Gentes,
   ab init. t. i. p. 2, edit. Colon), but also, developing the thought
   with greater specialty, he observes further, that the character of the
   Divine image, of the Divine Sonship in Christ, cannot consist merely in
   moral unity with God, because in that case other spiritual beings also,
   and especially liken, might be designated sons of God: hence the
   peculiarity of Christ must rest rather on His oneness of nature with
   God. In the sense of moral unity with God, he adds, patriarchs and
   prophets, apostles and martyrs, and even Christians now living, might
   be called the sons of God; for they resemble God, and are
   compassionate, like their Father in heaven,--they are imitators of the
   Apostle Paul, as he imitated Christ (Contra Arianos, Orat. iv. t. i. p.
   455, and especially pp. 462, 463, edit. Colon). Still we cannot with
   perfect certainty conclude from these expressions that Athanasius
   distinctly held the view that other individuals were sinless besides
   Jesus. In the first passage, it is to be remarked that the word kakia
   is too general and indefinite. In the other passages Athanasius avails
   himself of the thought of a repeatedly occurring moral perfection, only
   to strengthen another doctrinal line of argument; and it is doubtful
   with what degree of definiteness, and to what extent, this notion was
   applied by its author.

   [260] Comp. Gess, Lehre von der Person Chr. pp. 229, 239.

   [261] What has been advanced, must not, as is self-evident, be so
   understood as to make the Divinity of Christ a mere auxiliary
   proposition to the conceivability of His sinlessness. For axis would be
   to place that which should fill the highest place in a subordinate
   position. Our purpose is only to show how the sinlessness of Jesus
   points from itself to His Divinity. We may with equal correctness say,
   because God was in Christ, Christ was free from sin; or, because He was
   sinless, we have grounds for believing that God was in Him. The first
   proposition pertains more to the doctrinal, the second to the
   apologetic point of view; and since it is with this that we are here
   concerned, the latter naturally occupies the more prominent position.
   For the manner in which the results deduced from the development of the
   doctrinal side of the question coincide with those to which we are led,

   pp. 291-352.

CHAPTER II.

  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SINLESSNESS OF JESUS WITH RESPECT TO HIS RELATION TO
  MANKIND.
     __________________________________________________________________

   IT is obvious that a personality constituted as we have seen the Lord
   Jesus to be, must have a significance for the entire human race. It is
   as evident that this significance must be sought in that point in which
   the being and nature of such a personality is most essentially
   comprised and concentrated. Now the earthly. life of Jesus, from its
   commencement to its close, the purpose to which it was entirely
   devoted, was to make the true relation to God and to His fellow-men a
   living reality. Hence, too, His life-task, and the aim of all His
   outward acts, was to bring men in this highest of all respects into
   their right position, and thus to found their true, their imperishable
   happiness on God, the source of all life and blessedness.

   This, however, was to be accomplished, not in a race in whom the Divine
   image was still pure and unobscured,--the moral power, vigorous and
   unscathed. It was to be effected in one in which sin had attained a
   supremacy, which had eclipsed the image and the knowledge of God, in
   which the true fellowship with God had been destroyed, the moral powers
   enslaved, and a principle of discord and ruin introduced even into the
   relations between man and man. Hence what was needed could not be
   merely to give greater firmness and stability to a bond of Divine
   fellowship already in existence, and to cherish and render still more
   energetic a life already based on such communion. The question, on the
   contrary, was to form afresh the bond which sin had destroyed,--to
   plant anew, in the midst of a sinful condition, an entirely new life.
   The question was to bring about a re-union with God, to produce a new
   creation of human life--new to its very roots and sources; and this
   could only be effected by actually breaking the power of sin, and doing
   away with its guilt,--by taking away all that was either destructive or
   obstructive. For such a purpose, the influence of instruction and
   example, though of the most perfect kind, was by no means adequate. On
   the contrary, an atonement, a redemption, a mediation, were of absolute
   necessity. This being the case, it is evident that the being who is to
   intervene between the holy God and the sinful race of man, for the
   restoration of true and vital fellowship between them, can be none
   other than one standing in a relation towards God which is
   uninterrupted by sin, and at the same time impelled by holy love to
   enter into the very depths of human nature, and to take its entire
   condition upon himself. Jesus is such a being, by reason of His sinless
   perfection; and it is this very quality that makes Him capable of being
   the one mediator between God and man.

   If it be then asked what was needed for the purpose of bringing the
   human race, which through sin had become estranged from God, and at
   variance among themselves, into saving fellowship with God, and of
   laying in that race the foundation of a truly satisfactory state of
   life, the reply, if it is to be at once complete and particular, must
   embrace the whole work and scheme of salvation. We may, however, reduce
   that which falls within our present aim to a few general essential
   features. These seem to us to be the following: first, the revelation
   of the will of God to all men, so far as this is necessary for their
   salvation (knowledge of the method of salvation); secondly, the removal
   of all that separates the sinner from God, and the establishment, in
   its place, of a new life of fellowship with God (atonement and
   redemption); thirdly, the institution, upon this foundation, of a
   community whose aim and purpose should be wholly of a religious and
   moral character,--a community of fosterers and guardians of the new and
   Divine powers (foundation of the kingdom of God and of the Church); and
   fourthly, the assurance to the living members of this community of a
   final victory over all opposing powers, and of eternal glory (pledge of
   eternal life). All these we find in the Person of Jesus Christ. But we
   find them only in so far as He is sinless, and should not be able to
   find them in Him unless this were really the case. Had He been a man
   with the slightest taint of sin, He would not have been able to fulfil
   these necessary conditions. As the sinlessly perfect One, however, who
   stands in that oneness with God which He Himself asserts, He is, in the
   most direct manner, the personal revelation to us of the nature and
   will of God,--the true mediator between sinful man and the holy God;
   the royal founder of the kingdom of God and the Church, the highest of
   human communities; and the perfect pledge of everlasting life, and
   glorious victory to this community, and to its members united to
   Himself by a living faith.

   We shall now proceed to consider Him in each of these several aspects.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sec. 1.--The Sinless Jesus as the personal Revelation of God.

   Sinlessness, in the case of Him to whom it cannot but be conceded, is
   of itself a powerful guarantee of perfection, both in the knowledge of
   things Divine and moral, and in the doctrine arising therefrom. Sinless
   perfection and religious infallibility mutually condition each other;
   and Jesus Himself appeals, as we have seen, in proof that He spoke the
   truth, and that His doctrine was not His own, but His that sent Him, to
   the impossibility of convicting Him of sin, and to the fact that He did
   at all times such things as were pleasing to the Father. [262]

   But doctrine, simply as such, is not revelation. It is, indeed, a
   component, but only a deduced and secondary part of revelation, and
   everywhere presupposes--but most especially in Christianity--a more
   primitive and more comprehensive whole,--a series of actual Divine
   announcements. Doctrine, at best, can but tell us what we ought to
   think of God: from revelation, on the contrary, if we regard the term
   in its full meaning, we expect that it should show us what He is,--that
   it should manifest His nature. Without needing to itdduce evidence,
   revelation will of its very nature be itself the strongest actual proof
   of the Divine existence and government, by bringing the God of whom it
   is the witness and lively image as near to our soul as is possible,.
   and above all by disclosing to us His very nature, and making it an
   object of contemplation. In this sense, that alone can be a perfect
   revelation which is accomplished by means of the totality of a personal
   life. For God Himself, as the infinitely perfect, self-conscious
   Spirit, is essentially a person; and the true relation of created
   spirits to Him cannot be otherwise conceived of than as that of person
   to person. Hence that manifestation of God to man which completes all
   revelation, in which both the relation of God to man and of man to God
   is perfectly realized, must have that same form which we recognise as
   the highest form of life, viz. the personal. Only in this form can the
   fulness of the Divine Spirit and the Divine love suitably manifest the
   whole sum of those qualities which, in a moral sense, constitute the
   nature of God. Only thus can God draw so near to man, that he,
   according to the measure of his capacity, may become a partaker of Him.
   Only thus can the true relation of man to God be expressed by an,
   actual and genuine life, and a restorative, creative, vital power be
   implanted in the history of mankind in such wise that, from henceforth,
   the higher life of man may be renewed and developed by organic
   connection with this its true centre. Hence we may say that, the more
   personal the Divine revelation,--the more it is expressed, not merely
   as religious instruction, or as the delivery of law, but as personal
   life,--the higher is it in degree; and that the final and perfect
   revelation must necessarily be one which is essentially manifested in a
   holy personality, in one whose life and conduct bring before the very
   senses of man the nature and will of God.

   It is in this sense that Jesus is the revelation of God. It is He
   Himself that is this revelation, both in His own Person and in the
   totality of all that proceeded therefrom, whether in word or deed, of
   all the suffering and the glory, the humiliation and the exaltation,
   that was accomplished therein. It is thus that He represents Himself.
   He says, [263] I am the way, the truth, and the life,'--thus most
   expressly declaring that for the attainment of everlasting life
   everything depends upon His Person, and that in this respect He would
   be regarded not merely as one who teaches truth, but as truth
   impersonate, as truth manifested in life. In like manner, He designates
   Himself as one who has manifested unto men the name of the Father, i.e.
   the whole extent of His nature,. so far as it could be revealed in, the
   world, and to mankind. [264] He also asserts that no man can attain to
   the true knowledge of the Father but he to whom the Son will reveal
   Him; [265] and in that passage in which He speaks of a knowledge which
   is at the same time eternal life, He directly combines with the
   knowledge of the only true God that of Jesus Christ, whom He has sent.
   [266] Besides, wherever He speaks of a perfect and saving knowledge of
   God, He always represents this as brought about by means of His own
   Person; while it is undoubtedly Jesus who is intended, when
   subsequently the Son is designated in the apostolic circle as He
   through whom, as being the brightness of His glory and the express
   image of His Person, God has, after divers previous revelations, in
   these last days fully revealed Himself. [267]

   We have, moreover, this revelation of God in a personal life in Jesus,
   inasmuch as He was sinlessly perfect. His whole life breathes of God,
   is rooted in God, is inexplicable apart. from God. There is not, nor
   can there possibly be, a stronger evidence of the existence and
   government of God than such a life. If God is not to be seen and felt
   here, where, we may ask, is He to be found? But that He is to be found
   by, and that He is the rewarder of, them that seek Him, is told us by
   every word and act of the Lord Jesus, and is powerfully declared by His
   whole manifestation, in which the reality of a higher and a heavenly
   order of things is so overwhelmingly evident. And not only does the
   existence of God become a certainty through Him, but He is also the
   means of disclosing the nature of God, and that--as is indeed demanded
   by the very notion of revelation--under an entirely new aspect, an
   aspect which had not as yet become an all-pervading consciousness.
   Hitherto the power, the glory, the unapproachable dignity of God had
   been clearly perceived, while but a faint and distant idea of His grace
   had been entertained. But now, in the sinless Jesus, who died for a
   sinful world, in the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and
   truth,' that which constitutes the essential nature of God,--that
   which, as has been aptly said, is mast God-like in God, even His holy
   love, His preventing, sin-forgiving, death-conquering, and life-giving
   grace, [268] --is brought out in the clearest light. In the sinless
   One, who lived only for sinners, God was for the first time revealed in
   the manner needed for the salvation of a sinful world. Nor was this
   done in the way merely of doctrine and declaration, but very chiefly in
   that manner in which alone such a revelation could exercise creative
   energy, even by acts of direct intervention, by a totality of saving
   deeds and saving operations, centering in the divine-human Person of
   Jesus Christ Himself, the living exemplification of the holy love of
   God. In that miracle of Divine love--the whole being and life of
   Jesus--the nature of God, as love, is manifested in a manner than which
   it is impossible to conceive aught higher or more perfect; and therein
   is fulfilled that profound saying of St. John: [269] The law was given
   by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.'

   But a revelation of God concerns itself not merely with His nature, but
   also with His will. In this aspect it is still more apparent how Jesus
   the sinless One was the personal revelation of God to humanity. Looking
   at the moral side, we find that two conditions absolutely require to be
   complied with, if sinners--and all men are sinners--are to become
   well-pleasing in the sight of God. In the first place, they must be
   brought to know their sin, and to repent of it in their inmost soul;
   and further, the good must be set before their minds in its whole
   compass by means of a living and powerful example. Both these
   things--self-abasing knowledge of sin, and quickening knowledge of
   good--are effected in an incomparably excellent way by the
   manifestation of holy life given us in Jesus; and this manifestation is
   a moral revelation of God, because its true foundation is in Him.

   Without doubt, even the moral law, both in its positive and in its
   unwritten form in the conscience, produced knowledge of sin, and sorrow
   on account of it. But evidently mere knowledge of and sorrow for sin in
   themselves are not all,--everything depends on their purity and depth;
   and here it must at once, be acknowledged that a concrete life will
   have quite a different effect from an abstract law. [270]

   The knowledge of sin may always be measured by the knowledge of good.
   The more complete and certain the latter, the truer and deeper the
   former. Now it is unquestionable that no law is able to communicate so
   sure and full a knowledge of good, as the life of one truly holy in all
   relations and circumstances. Conscience, when tenderly cherished and
   cultivated, does indeed speak with great certainty, but it is never
   infallible. It takes its tone in part from our own inward state it is
   itself entangled in that web of sin which is thrown around our whole
   being; and, as a thousand instances prove, it may go astray, it may
   even fall into a state of most fearful blindness, if it is not guided
   and enlightened by an external standard clearly held before it. The
   positive law, being more fixed and definite, is of course surer than
   the law in the conscience, but both lack that living completeness which
   is necessary for giving true knowledge of the good. They stand above
   and outside of our life: the commands they issue are abstract and
   general. Even the law as we find it in the Old Testament does not
   present the standard of good in its greatest perfection, not in the
   whole depth of its free inwardness. These defects are all overcome and
   supplied in the holy and sinless life of Jesus. There we have a sure
   standard. His life is conscience outwardly realized. We find there a
   perfection of good as to principle, and a carrying of it out in action,
   in all relations, which can never be surpassed. Consequently, in the
   presence of this exemplification of holy life, an entirely different
   knowledge of sin is awakened,--a knowledge much purer, deeper, more
   certain and complete, than any which arises from mere law.

   That which thus holds true with respect to the knowledge of sin, is
   equally true as regards sorrow for sin. Is it not natural that he who
   gazes on absolute righteousness and truth, realized in the living
   example of Jesus, who beholds there the transcript of human nature and
   the human will in their original purity, and who therefore comes to
   know the beauty and perfection, the glory and excellence of the holy
   Divine will, should humble himself more deeply and truly than the man
   who can merely oppose a stern commandment to himself and his
   inclinations?' [271] In His realization of the good, Jesus always
   referred to God, not to the law. Hence it is that, as we stand in His
   holy presence, we become more truly conscious, than in any other
   circumstances, of that quality of sin, in virtue of which it is
   rebellion against God, unfaithfulness towards Him; and thus, too, of
   the deep guilt which sin involves. Inasmuch, however, as Jesus
   sacrificed His own pure life in the conflict with sin, the sinner may
   at the same time see in Him the love which went even to death for his
   sake: and how much more genuine and inward a sorrow for sin must this
   awaken than the mere thought of having transgressed the law! In this
   aspect, the life of Jesus had the effect of separating most distinctly
   good from evil, and did in the true sense discern and judge men.
   Through Him a direct judgment was executed on sin, which is shown to be
   Divine by its purity and holiness. In His Person man possesses a living
   power capable of awakening the knowledge of sin, and of calling forth
   sorrow for it,--a power which they who experience it will confess to be
   of Divine origin, and a constituent part of revelation.

   More important still, however, is the positive side. Not only was the
   whole strength of sin laid bare, but man was made also to see and feel
   the whole purity and fulness of life possessed by the good; for how
   could he be brought to the determination of making goodness the
   substance and aim of his life, unless he saw its beauty and loveliness?
   It is not of course to be questioned that a susceptibility for the
   ideal of moral perfection is implanted in man along with his moral
   capabilities; but precisely at the moment when we feel that in this
   ideal there is nothing which contradicts and is foreign to true human
   nature,--that, on the contrary, it really belongs to our nature,--the
   question presses itself most strongly upon us: Why, then, do we not
   universally find in mankind a full belief in the existence of perfect
   goodness, and living examples of its attainment? And why was it that,
   when it did appear in full distinctness, it was but gradually, with
   much difficulty and after much resistance, that it penetrated the minds
   of those who beheld it? The simple reason is, that man cannot possibly
   produce what does not previously live in himself. The image of the
   perfect good, however, could not live in him, because sin did not
   permit its free development. It slumbered in him. It must have done so,
   or no power could ever have awakened it in his inner being, and it
   would always have remained incomprehensible to him. But it did not live
   in him, else would he have had a distinct and full consciousness of it.
   Proofs enough that such an ideal did not live in him, are furnished by
   history. The idea of justice, of a self-complacent virtue which
   prudently keeps the mean between two extremes, the idea of accordance
   with the laws and with that which is commended by all reasonable men,
   [272] was the highest point to which educated reason rose before the
   appearance of Christ; and even this idea was more a matter discussed in
   the schools, than a universal persuasion. On the contrary, the picture
   of one who is filled with holy love,--of a love of the good for the
   sake of God,--of a love which compassionates the souls of others,
   seeks, and sacrifices itself for their salvation, was foreign even to
   the most cultivated reason; nay, not only foreign to it as mere natural
   reason, but even unnatural and overstrained. Such an ideal could only
   be introduced amongst men through the medium of facts, of an actual
   life. The life by which this is effected cannot be regarded as a mere
   product of humanity, a climax reached by existing human nature; but,
   because an entirely new element, even true holiness, is there revealed,
   it must be viewed as the work of the Spirit from on high, as the
   operation of God. It is, in fact, a communication of God to humanity,
   and is as truly a revelation in connection with the department of
   morals, as what is usually so designated in connection with religion.
   [273]

   This ideal has been set before us in the Person of Jesus, in Him who
   was the sinless One, who, because He lived only in God, was not merely
   a perfectly righteous man, but also manifested a love which proclaimed
   itself Divine by its holy earnestness and unbounded devotion. He is
   man, as God would have Him be, and therefore is He also the full and
   living expression of the Divine will to humanity. In Him, the Son full
   of grace and truth, has the Sun of Righteousness arisen upon man; in
   His light it is that we first see light, even in a moral sense, in its
   full brightness.

   The presence of such a distinct, fixed, and elevated standard must
   unquestionably be of infinite value for the moral development of
   humanity. The significance of the matter becomes still greater, when we
   consider the mode and circumstances in which it was accomplished. Such
   ideals and examples of the good and noble as are to be found before the
   coming of Jesus, all wanted power to affect and actually to transform
   the depths of man's life,--to transform humanity as a whole. The reason
   thereof was partially that they were not in reality the highest, but
   more because they were only products of thought,--products of intellect
   in a higher state of cultivation than was commonly attainable. Even
   when, as under the old covenant, these examples came before men clothed
   with Divine authority, and in a shape which the common understanding
   might lay hold of, they only appear as requirement, not as fulfilment.
   It is otherwise in Jesus. In His case, the ideal of perfect goodness is
   not merely set forth by a personality as a product of thought, but is
   realized in its life. Hence arises the extreme value it has in relation
   to moral intuitions and knowledge, and its boundless influence on our
   moral volitions and acts.

   There is a further superiority, also, of this realization in Jesus,
   that it has both an all-inclusive and a universally intelligible
   character. The image of goodness in Jesus, we say, is
   all-comprehensive. It exhibits before us that which is true and
   universal in human nature under the very conditions to which every man
   is subject, in the relations of individuality, of race, of family, and
   of nationality, and is therefore sufficient for all, however situated
   as to these conditions of life. [274] He realized the ideal in all the
   essential relations of life, especially in those which are attended
   with most difficulty and temptation; and has thus shown not only that,
   but how, good may be preserved intact, and come off victorious in all
   circumstances. He exemplified it not only in single and prominent
   virtues, not in a partial and fragmentary manner, but in the entirety
   of life, as a single and perfect work, resulting from complete
   harmoniousness of mind. He consequently stands before us as a true and
   universal example,--not as a model of which we are to copy the separate
   parts, but as a type the true spirit of which we are to appropriate as
   a whole. Nor is it less a characteristic that it is intelligible. It is
   deep and rich enough to furnish a subject which human comprehension and
   delineation can never exhaust; and, at the same time, it is placed
   before mankind in features so grand and mighty, yet so direct and
   affecting, that the simplest soul, yea, the mind of a child, can
   understand it, and even those who would resist, are impressed by it. We
   may consequently affirm of the moral example of Christ, that it .is one
   universally binding; and in this sense also may we apply to it the
   words of the apostle, In Christ Jesus there is neither Jew nor Greek,
   bond nor free, male nor female.' [275] This example is destined alike
   for all, that all may make it their own; and all alike are destined for
   it, that it may live in them for ever. But that which thus stands in
   its all-embracing greatness above humanity, although it is at the same
   time truly human, which has not proceeded from, and is,
   notwithstanding, destined ever to enter into humanity, is stamped with
   the seal of a Divine revelation.

   Sec. 2. The Sinless Jesus as the Mediator between God and Sinful Man.

   Although the revelation of the nature and will of God form an essential
   part of the scheme of salvation, yet it is evident that by it alone man
   cannot be saved. The relation of man to God is not merely one of
   intellect to intellect,--it is a relation of person to person, and
   embraces the whole life. And the more so, since the matter here in
   question concerns the position which the creature occupies with
   reference to his Creator, and thus to Him who is in all respects the
   source and support of his whole being. Hence nothing will suffice but
   perfect communion of life and of love. But this communion is opposed by
   sin, whose very nature is antagonism to God; and sin, which, as well as
   the guilt it implies, and the consequences that flow from it, is a real
   power in human life, cannot be done away with merely by means of
   knowledge, though this were the purest and most complete which can be
   conceived. In order to break its might, and destroy it, there must be
   opposed to it another equally real but higher power. But this power
   cannot come from man,--it must come from God. For it is only God who
   can forgive men their sins, and take away their guilt; from God alone
   can the scheme of reconciliation go forth; God alone can, by the actual
   communication of His grace, set up a new power in the soul, which shall
   be mightier than sin and all its consequences. And yet, since it is for
   men that the reconciliation is designed, it is only by a corresponding
   human medium that it can be consummated. Moreover, this human mediator
   must be capable of imparting to the soul a principle of life and
   goodness, in the place of the principle of sin, which is now
   subjugated. Just such a medium do we find in the sinless Jesus, as we
   shall now proceed to show.

   In Him, the Son of God, who is one with the Father, we recognise not
   merely a typical and symbolical representation, but an actual
   realization and communication of the holy love and saving grace of God.
   All that He was, all that He did and suffered, had the joint purpose of
   bringing back sinful man into fellowship with God, of bestowing upon
   him Divine grace, and of bringing about a true reconciliation between
   him and the holy God. His sufferings and His death, which form the
   consummation of His whole life of self-sacrifice, occupy so special a
   position in this respect, that our attention must be more particularly
   directed to them.

   And, first, Jesus Himself attributes to His death and sufferings the
   utmost importance in this respect. In His view, His death was an
   essential element of the Divine counsel, and an indispensable part of
   that work of redemption which He came to accomplish. [276] And in what
   sense it was so, is obvious from His own words. He calls Himself the
   Good Shepherd, who, while the hireling flees from the invading wolf,
   lays down His life for the sheep, that they may have life, and have it
   more abundantly. [277] He designates Himself as the corn of wheat,
   which, if it is not to abide alone, but to bring forth much fruit, must
   fall into the earth and die. [278] He compares Himself--the Son of
   Man--with the serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness for the
   healing of the people, [279] --thus alluding to His own lifting up on
   the cross, [280] the effect of which will be, that all who believe on
   Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. He will give His life
   a ransom for many, [281] as the price for the redemption of those souls
   whom guilt has exposed to punishment. His blood is to be shed for the
   remission of sin, [282] and to become, by being shed, the blood of the
   new covenant; [283] that is, the blood through which the covenant of
   perfect union, of true reconciliation between. God and man, receives
   its formal ratification and consecration. On the other hand, He would
   equally have His death regarded as the alone means by which true life
   is begotten in man; His flesh is meat indeed, His blood is drink
   indeed; and they who feed on Him, who by faith receive Him into their
   souls, are united to Him, and made partakers of everlasting life. [284]

   It is thus that He who offers a sinless life as a pledge of the truth
   of His word, expresses Himself concerning the significance of His life
   and death. In His own eyes, His death was undoubtedly the chief means
   of expiation, reconciliation, and communication of new life; and if He
   does not call it in so many words an atoning sacrifice, He plainly
   implies that it is so, while His apostles afterwards decidedly express
   the fact. In directing our attention to the death of Jesus in this
   point of view, it cannot, however, enter into our purpose to discuss
   the act of redemption and atonement thereby accomplished in its full
   extent. [285] On the contrary, we would, in conformity with the course
   of our argument, bring forward only that which stands in unmistakeable
   connection with the sinless perfection of Jesus, and the conclusions
   involved in the very nature of this doctrine. Our subject thus leading
   us to the significance of the death of Christ, especially as an atoning
   sacrifice, we shall endeavour, on the one hand, briefly to show that
   such a significance cannot be conceded to His death unless He is indeed
   sinless; and, on the other hand, that if He is so, this significance is
   but the natural consequence of His sinlessness.

   Atonement, generally speaking, turns upon the fact that the pure, the
   innocent, the unpolluted, is given up, is offered to God, in the place
   of the sinful, guilty, and vile, in order to bring about the
   deliverance of the latter. It has for its object to restore that
   relation of man to God which sin had disturbed, and to reconcile the
   sinner to God; and it takes place where there is a knowledge of sin and
   of the holiness of God, as well as of the antagonism existing between
   them, and consequently a felt need of pardon and grace. An
   approximation to this idea of atonement existed even in some heathen
   religions. But it was in the religion of the Old Covenant that it was
   first fully apprehended, because here, first, we find a full
   consciousness of God's holiness, and of the penal character of sin, as
   opposed to the Divine law. Here sacrifice had a twofold object: on the
   one hand, it sought to deepen in the mind of him who offered it the
   feeling of sin and guilt, and to give a strong expression to that
   feeling; and, on the other, it furnished a means whereby the offerer
   might receive an assurance of Divine grace, and be replaced in a right
   position towards God. In both respects, the fundamental idea is that of
   substitution. The sacrifice of the animal, in which the worshipper gave
   up something of his own,--something belonging, as it were, to his own
   person, placing himself in direct connection with it by laying his hand
   upon it, and generally slaughtering it himself,--shadowed forth the
   self-sacrifice of him who offered it; while the death which the animal
   suffered, represented the death which his sin deserved. Then, as the
   consequence of his penitence, and by virtue of the promise which was
   attached to the sacrificial offering, he received the assurance that
   God accepted the ransom, and now looked upon the sinner with favour.

   Now this service of sacrifices, although it unquestionably arose out of
   a deep religious want, although in itself highly significant and full
   of meaning, and well adapted to that particular stage of religious
   development, had, nevertheless, something inadequate about it, and
   could never thoroughly accomplish that real abolition of sin and
   implantation of holiness which the nature of the case required. All was
   symbolic representation, and there was no actual moral transaction. In
   general, sin was acknowledged to be sinful, but the full extent of its
   guilt was unperceived. Divine grace was prefigured, but not actually
   communicated. The relation in which the offerer of the sacrifice stood
   to the animal he sacrificed, was a voluntary, not a necessary relation;
   the rite was to him an outward event, the sacrifice was not received
   into his very soul. As the sacrifice offered was an animal which had
   Indeed, as a thing consecrated to God, a sacred character ascribed to
   it, but which of course could not be. really holy, there could go forth
   from it no sanctifying power. Hence, although these sacrifices might
   for a time calm the sense of guilt, they could not take away sin, and
   establish in its place a true fellowship with God and a new life. Hence
   sacrifices of this kind, as has been already shown, could neither
   powerfully affect the heart, nor continue efficient in all time, but
   needed to be constantly repeated. They could effect a temporary
   relaxation of the variance between God and the sinner, but could obtain
   no eternal redemption. [286] Now, what could not thus be
   accomplished--viz. the restoration of a life which should be inwardly
   reconciled to God, and really free from sin--was performed by Christ.
   But it was not merely by the abolition of sacrificial worship that
   Christ accomplished this; it was by realizing in Himself all that had
   been striven after, but never attained, in sacrifices. The perfect
   self-surrender of Him, the All-holy, for sinful men, which was the only
   real and sanctifying sacrifice, whose efficacy should last for ever,
   came in the place of those merely typical sacrifices which were now to
   cease, having found their true fulfilment in that great sacrifice.

   A free self-sacrifice of this kind necessarily presupposes and is based
   upon the sinless purity of him who offers it. The very idea of such an
   offering could have been justifiably conceived only by one who knew
   himself to be pure and spotless in the sight of God; and such an
   offering, if made by a really sinless being, could not fail of
   effecting the purpose contemplated. The sacrifice of Jesus is
   distinguished from all previous sacrifices chiefly by this, that it was
   not a representation and foreshadowing, but a real moral transaction;
   it was a free action, of a purely ethical character. Jesus, in whose
   Person the sacrifice and the priest are one, offered Himself, as the
   Epistle to the Hebrews expresses it, through the eternal Spirit unto
   God. [287] And in this offering of Himself, He preserved the most
   perfect liberty of action. For however we may regard His death to have
   been brought about by circumstances, still we must acknowledge that it
   was by a free decision of His own will that He took it upon Him. Now
   this act, thus freely determined on, can only be regarded as the result
   of a will thoroughly pure and unenslaved by sinful love of self; and we
   must regard this sublime resolve as the culminating action of a life
   which was itself, from first to last, a perfect sacrifice. But this
   free self-determination to death can only be viewed as a purely moral
   action, and free from all tincture of fanaticism, if based upon a full
   consciousness that this death was necessary to the carrying out of the
   Divine plan, of salvation, and an indispensable condition of the
   redemption of man, and the establishment of a kingdom of God upon
   earth. This consciousness could be possessed only by One who, in virtue
   of His holiness and His oneness with God, had a clear insight into the
   whole purpose of God in salvation. Again, Jesus could desire to offer
   Himself as a sacrifice for sinners, only if He felt that He was pure
   and stainless; and might therefore regard His offering as a sacrifice
   well-pleasing to God. It was, in truth, an indispensable condition of
   the sacrifice that the victim was immaculate, for only such a one could
   be worthy of God. The physical immaculateness of the animal sacrificed,
   rises in this personal self-sacrifice of Jesus into moral
   stainlessness. That He who sought to give Himself as a sacrifice to
   free the world from sin should have been conscious of being Himself a
   sinner, or felt Himself to be in any one respect unclean before God,
   would have been not merely a contradiction, it would have been a gross
   impiety: if, on the other hand, He did not make upon all the impression
   that He was perfectly sinless, then one might suppose that it was for
   His own sin, for His own guilt, that He suffered. Only in the case of
   One who was perfectly free from sin can we feel confident that the
   suffering which He underwent, however much it may have conduced to His
   Divine perfecting, was endured not on account of His own guilt, but for
   the guilt of others. [288]

   The principal thing, however, is that the sinless holiness of Jesus was
   an essential reason why His free act of self-sacrifice really attained
   the ends which previous sacrifices had but aimed at: that is, it became
   the means of imparting a full knowledge of sin, and was itself an
   actual communication of Divine grace, a substitution in the truest and
   deepest sense, a real destroying of sin, and a real implanting in its
   place of a new life of sanctification.

   In the first place, it is in the contemplation of the self-immolation
   of the Holy One, that we come to understand what sin is, in its
   absolute antagonism to holiness. For in the fact that both love,
   unreservedly sacrificing itself, and sin, in all its power and
   malignity, are here exhibited in utmost distinctness and placed in
   juxtaposition, the true nature of each becomes clearer to us, and even
   the dullest understanding can appreciate to some extent the vast
   difference between them. But further, we cannot fail to observe, that
   the sin which is here brought before us is not sin in its isolated
   phenomena, but that it is the dominant sin of the race,--that sin which
   operates as a universal power in humanity, and of which we may trace
   the workings in ourselves. The Holy One dies, not in a conflict with
   sin in any special manifestation, but with sin itself,' [289] in order
   to break its entire power; and in His death both the power of sin and
   its opposition to God are exhibited with incomparable distinctness.
   There is, as has already been shown, no more effectual means of
   awakening the heart to a knowledge of sin, and a true sorrow for sin,
   than the life-picture of the Holy One, as it is presented to us in the
   gospel; but, above all, it is from the contemplation of the Crucified
   offering Himself for the sins of the world that this benign influence
   proceeds; and assuredly no one can deny that the consciousness of sin
   is called forth in a manner infinitely more clear and more intense by
   the sacrifice of the sinless Christ, than it ever was by former
   sacrifices. These contained, at most, a general monition against sin;
   they did not hold up to the soul the mirror of a love freely giving
   itself up for the sinner to suffering and to death.

   But here, too, the positive side is much stronger. All that the
   sacrifices of the earlier dispensation could accomplish, was to typify
   and symbolize the Divine grace: but the sacrifice of Jesus actually
   communicates that grace. For if the sinless One is so united to God
   that His love is to us a real manifestation of the love of God Himself,
   and that we must recognise Him to be an impersonation of the Divine
   love, all this must be most forcibly expressed in that highest act of
   His life, His free surrender of Himself to death from love to man. In
   this act we see two things: we see One who has established His claim to
   be regarded as the Son of God, freely giving Himself up to die; and we
   see God not sparing His own Son, that He may give Him up to death for
   the salvation of man. In the sacrificial death of the Holy One we see
   immediately the reconciled and gracious God, because therein the
   eternal love of God--that love whose very nature it is to be a
   sin-forgiving, a saving, a helping love--is not only manifested, but so
   offered that it may be directly accepted by the sinner. Nor does this
   love offer itself at the expense of the holiness of God: on the
   contrary, it does so in a manner which alone truly satisfies the claims
   of that holiness for the sacrifice of the sinless One possesses, in a
   very different way from the earlier sacrifices, a vicarious
   significance and a sanctifying efficacy. [290]

   Against sin itself there can exist in God only a righteous displeasure,
   fully bent upon its extirpation. To the sinner, as such, He must not be
   a gracious, but an angry, because a holy God and such does the sinner
   know Him to be when conscience awakes within him. If God is to bestow
   His favour upon him, this can only be done on condition that the
   partition wall of guilt shall be done away with, and the foundation of
   the sinner's sanctification at the same time laid. On the other hand,
   the sinner, too, needs a pledge and assurance of the Divine favour, if
   he is to have that delight in goodness, and that power to perform it,
   which lie at the very root of holiness. Thus on both sides a mediation
   is requisite; and here it is that the holy and sinless One comes in,
   and is seen living, suffering, and dying, as the sinner's Substitute.
   By His unconditional surrender of Himself to God and to mankind, He
   renders the forgiveness of sin and the bestowal of grace, the
   restoration and renewal of the sinner, really possible.

   There is an essential difference between the one great sacrifice and
   the previous typical sacrifices. In these, sin was borne, and that but
   externally, by an unconscious animal, which was itself without the
   sphere of religion and morality. Jesus, however, moved by compassionate
   love, consciously and unreservedly entered into the world of sinners,
   and though Himself untouched by sin, took upon Himself, as an actual
   member of the same, the sins of all. Then, voluntarily appearing before
   God with these sins upon Him, He suffered their fearful consequences to
   fall upon Himself, as though He had been the most flagrant of sinners
   and evil-doers. Thus He fully satisfied the claims of Divine justice
   against mankind; and by surrendering Himself to death, made an
   atonement for the sin of all, which sinners themselves were unable to
   furnish. In this manner was the wall of partition between the holy God
   and sinful man broken down, and the destroyed relation between them so
   restored, that the love of God may now be unreservedly bestowed upon
   man. In the Son, in whom He is well pleased, God looks upon mankind,
   and beholds first a race restored, and then individuals under a process
   of restoration. In the holy Son of God, who shed His blood for the
   forgiveness of sin, the sinner beholds One in whom he possesses the
   assurance that God is, of a truth, a reconciled and gracious God.

   That this is possible, depends again on the nature of the fellowship
   which is perfectly realized in Christ, and which takes so important a
   place in His whole work. For as, on the one hand, Christ is so
   absolutely one with God, that His whole manifestation, especially His
   death, must be regarded as an actual living manifestation of God
   Himself, as a God of love; so, on the other hand, He becomes equally
   one with men, enters into the fullest life-fellowship with them; gives
   Himself entirely to them, in His love; lives, suffers, and dies, not
   for Himself, but for them,--not in order to procure some one special
   benefit, but that He may purchase the salvation of the whole race. And
   in virtue of this self-devotion, which truly unites Him with humanity,
   He is no longer to be regarded as a separately existing individual, but
   as the universal man, as comprehending the whole of humanity in
   Himself, as its Substitute and Head. In this way, Christ, being one
   with humanity, communicates to it everything which He Himself
   possesses. A holy and happy exchange takes place between Christ and
   man, by which He who took upon Him our sin and guilt, and suffered our
   death, imparts to us His righteousness, His peace, His happiness, and
   bestows upon us that which He obtained for them.

   Doubtless this presupposes something on our side: we must enter into
   His fellowship, we must by faith lay hold of the salvation offered to
   us, and thereby become partakers of the reconciling power of His life
   and death. And here, again, we trace the difference that exists between
   the old sacrifices, and the one all-efficacious propitiation of Christ.
   The ante-Christian sacrifices remained without the offerers; and
   although they doubtless made some impression upon their minds, they
   were still external to those for whom they were to make an atonement,
   and could not penetrate into their hearts with quickening and renewing
   power. The sacrifice of Christ, on the contrary, is from its very
   nature such, that it cannot remain a merely external, strange, and
   accidental circumstance, where there is any susceptibility for its
   reception, but must enter into the soul, and place him who by, faith
   appropriates it, in a living relation to the object sacrificed. And
   this is the case, because .this object is a person, and the sacrifice
   itself the voluntary act of holy love. Hence it is that a stream of
   love and life goes forth therefrom, that a tie is formed between Him
   who offers Himself as a sacrifice, and him who appropriates this
   sacrifice. By this inward personal union it is that strength is
   imparted to the latter, in virtue of which there is begotten in him,
   together with an assurance of pardon and reconciliation, the actual
   beginnings of a new life and of victory over sin.

   Viewed thus, the idea of substitution--which, if understood merely in
   an external and formal sense, is indeed to be rejected as dead and
   false--becomes something living and true. The connection between Christ
   and His believing followers is expressed by St. Paul in words of
   profound significance, as being in Christ.' So close is the living
   union between the Head and the members, that they form parts of one
   whole. His fellowship with Christ, from which the Spirit and the life
   of Christ pass into his soul, makes the believer a partaker in all that
   Christ Himself is. In this fellowship he learns to know God as a God of
   grace. In this fellowship, even when it exists only in its early
   dawnings, he does not stand alone in the sight of God, but is in His
   sight as one who has been grafted into Christ, and is united by faith
   with Him. On this account, God can in His love impart to him His grace,
   even although sin still exists within him, because in his oneness with
   the sinless Christ the dominion of sin is destroyed, its power is
   broken, and a hope and a pledge of its ultimate total overthrow are
   bestowed.

   Hence, when it is said that in Christ God is gracious to the sinner,
   this does not mean that He is so by reason of an arbitrary act of
   grace, but that He is gracious to the sinner in Christ, because, as
   soon as a sinner becomes united to Christ, God beholds in him one in
   whom there is given, not in virtue of his own strength, but in virtue
   of the operation of Christ in him, a pledge that he will attain to
   actual freedom from sin. [291] Now if this importance attaches to the
   sacrifice of Christ, it is apparent how His sacrifice must be regarded
   as the only sacrifice, offered once for all. [292] It possesses
   entirely and for ever the power to communicate Divine grace, and to
   impart the new life. And therefore it is not possible objectively to
   renew His sacrifice: the only way in which it can be offered again is a
   subjective one; that is, by such an inward following of the example of
   Jesus by each believer, that, being thus himself a priest, he may also
   offer himself to God as a spiritual sacrifice in Christ.

   In this sense it is that we recognise in the sinless One the only true
   Mediator between God and man. In Jesus we see Him in whom God is well
   pleased with man, and turns to him in grace,--Him in whom man may
   behold with unveiled face, and believingly appropriate this grace, and
   thus be transfigured into the Divine image. But this naturally involves
   a further consequence. If Jesus, by His sinless holiness, thus restores
   the vital fellowship between sinful man and God, He thereby becomes at
   the same time the author of the true fellowship between man and man,
   the founder of a kingdom of God, a kingdom of faith, extending far
   beyond the limits of those circumstances which have hitherto exercised
   a separating power over mankind; and it is as occupying this no less
   fundamental position, that we have now to consider Him more closely.

   Sec. 3.--The Holy Jesus as the Founder of the True Fellowship of Men.

   Men being by their very nature disposed to associate one with another,
   we find that all the chief activities of human life, as well as its
   fundamental arrangements, are calculated to bring about such
   association. Everywhere we meet with a reciprocal giving and taking, an
   acting and producing on the part of some, a being acted upon and a
   receiving on the part of others, a drawing together of the congenial,
   and an excluding of the uncongenial; and they who would entirely
   withdraw from the mutual interaction thus arising, cannot but be
   regarded as individuals of unsound and incomplete development. Hence
   there necessarily arises upon the foundation of the family, as the
   primitive and typical association, civil, political, and national
   associations; and those associations for the purposes of art, of
   science, and of intercourse in the various spheres of intellectual
   pursuits, which are partly restricted to the former, and partly of far
   greater relative extent. But all these fellowships, great and important
   as they are, have yet their strict and definite limits. They are either
   confined within certain local boundaries, or are inseparably connected
   with some special kind of nationality or endowment, and often even with
   a certain degree of culture or social position. Hence, by their very
   nature, they involve, to a certain extent, a principle of separation,
   as well as of association. They do not unite men as such, but only men
   of certain definite peculiarities, and thus exclude all those who are
   not thus distinguished.,

   There is, however, a task allotted to all men, without exception, and
   for which all, as beings made in God's image, possess the requisite
   endowments: and this is the recovery of the right relation to the holy
   and living God, and to every human being. This task, besides being
   universal, is absolutely the highest that can be engaged in; and if
   co-operation and association are requisite for the accomplishment of
   any human undertaking, they are so in this instance. For it is only
   upon the soil of society that piety and morality can display a healthy
   and vital energy, only from such a soil that they can derive the
   nutriment necessary to their growth and perfection. In their case
   isolation would be synonymous with deformity, degeneracy, annihilation.
   If in these respects that which is true and excellent is to be
   obtained, there must of necessity exist a fellowship which,
   transcending all existing limitations, is by its very nature calculated
   to embrace all men without distinction, and to promote the attainment
   of that eternal destination which is alike set before all. Not till
   such a fellowship exists will the true foundation be laid for every
   other kind of association among mankind. Not before, will a possibility
   exist of preventing those distinctions which naturally divide men, from
   effecting a hostile separation. Not before, will communities and
   individuals, nay, different nations, recognise the fact that they are
   made, not for themselves alone, but for each other,--that they are
   destined mutually to aid and supplement each other,--that thus, by the
   reciprocal action and reaction of the better gifts of all, humanity may
   be fashioned into a true and living unity.

   Now, a fellowship of this supreme and universal kind can be founded
   only upon that union between man and God which is effected by faith or
   religion. Hence its very existence is an impossibility so long as
   religion cannot be found in a state of purity and independence, but
   only in combination with other and particular elements, by which it
   also is placed in a position of specialty and particularity. This was
   the case in the præ-Christian world, and is still so in nations beyond
   the pale of Christianity. In these we everywhere find a religion so
   indissolubly connected with the special constitution of a country, with
   peculiarities of nationality, with the degrees of culture and political
   institutions of certain nations, that it cannot be separated therefrom.
   We find religions in which nature, religions in which art, is
   deified,--state religions, and religious states but we do not find a
   religion free from all admixture with foreign elements, and keeping
   within its own proper territory,--a religion which is entirely itself,
   and will be nothing else but itself, which makes that, and that only,
   which is its special province--even the eternal salvation of its
   professors--its chief concern. Such a religion is not found previously
   to the appearance of Christianity, and is found in Christianity alone.
   Here religion is brought back entirely to its own special province, and
   thus offers that firm and self-supporting point whence the whole circle
   of human life may be worked upon, and gathered into one harmonious
   whole.

   But this could be effected only by a person whose whole and sole task
   it should be to exhibit in perfect purity the Divine image in man, and
   to make that image comprehensible to all,--by One who actually did
   accomplish this task, and that in such wise, that none who were
   susceptible of such an emotion could fail of being touched thereby. The
   sinless Jesus was such a Person. By manifesting religion not only in
   its perfection, but also in its unmingled purity and entire
   independence, He at the same time laid the foundation of a fellowship
   which, being restricted by no kind of external condition, was capable
   of including the whole human race,--a fellowship which, while remaining
   faithful to its original purpose, may exercise a free and real
   influence upon every department of social life, upon art and science,
   upon legislation and politics, without intermeddling directly with
   these things, much less putting itself in their place.

   In the foundation of such a community, Jesus Himself recognised an
   essential element of His mission. He invites all who need redemption;
   that is, all men. [293] He wills that all should be one in Him, as He
   is one with the Father; and it is by this very union through Him, and
   in Him, that the world is to know that the Father has sent Him. [294]
   He proclaims the kingdom of God as at hand, as having already, come,
   [295] as His kingdom. It is not, however, to be a kingdom of this
   world, but a kingdom of heaven, [296] to be developed indeed in the
   world, but to be pervaded by heavenly powers, and to attain maturity in
   a future and heavenly period. For its earthly development--during the
   course of which He particularly distinguishes between what is God's and
   what is Cæsar's, and thus points out the propriety of separating the
   spiritual from the secular [297] --He would have a Church, to be
   gathered from all nations, from the whole human race. [298] To effect
   this, He sent forth His apostles, and endowed them with His Spirit. For
   the regular continuance of the Church which they were to found, and
   which, consequently, was to be a manifest and visible one, He made
   special preparations, by instituting holy Baptism and the Lord's
   Supper, and by laying down rules as to how those who were disobedient
   in the Church were to be treated. [299] And in all this He was so sure
   of success, that He not only promised to the Church which He called His
   an imperishable existence, against which no power should prevail, [300]
   but He already beheld with a glance which surveyed and comprised the
   whole process of the world's development, the whole redeemed human race
   as one flock, under Himself, the one Shepherd. [301]

   Jesus, however, not merely purposed to institute such a community, He
   not merely announced such a purpose, but possessed in Himself the power
   to form and to maintain it. An all-embracing fellowship of personal
   spirits, united by a common faith and a common love, presupposes a
   personal head. And He, the holy Son of God and Son of Man, who lived
   entirely for men, and gave Himself a sacrifice for them, was, from His
   very nature, this Head. For the Head must be so constituted, that the
   Spirit by which the community is to be pervaded and governed, may
   continually flow forth therefrom in pure and inexhaustible fulness. And
   this is the qualification which is offered in. Him in most abundant
   measure.

   Men, sinful and limited as they are, do not possess, in and of
   themselves, the power of forming themselves into a lasting fellowship
   of the highest kind. They must find the living point of union for such
   a purpose in a holy Being exalted above themselves, and capable of
   lifting them up above self, in One who, by uniting them to Himself, at
   the same time brings them into vital union with each other. But when
   One thus holy and thus exalted has once really laid hold of the hearts
   of men, this union will be the inevitable result. For there is in the
   Divine, when vividly presented in life, a magnetic power which draws
   minds out of their isolation, and unites them with an unseen but
   powerful bond. This life-magnet, this infinite force of attraction, is
   introduced among mankind, in the Person of that Divine and Holy One who
   sacrificed Himself in holy love for the sinful race. By Him must every
   one who is susceptible of its influence be drawn out of his own narrow
   self. But it is not only out of self that those who feel the powers of
   Christ are attracted, through that faith which He calls forth within
   them. They are also drawn into His life, made one with Him, and thus
   made one among themselves. This kind of union is at once the most
   perfect and the most lasting, for it is the work of the Highest:
   through it, man is raised above himself; and by it, that selfishness
   which otherwise obstructs all true fellowship, is, in its very essence,
   destroyed. [302]

   It is true that all this applies immediately to those only who have
   actually laid hold of Christ by faith. But then these are the salt of
   the earth, the leaven which is destined gradually to leaven the mass.
   They are to introduce an ever-extending, and at length an
   all-comprehending union. The moving spring of this union is love,--that
   pitying, seeking, saving love which was brought into the world by the
   holy Jesus of the gospel. This love sees in every one who needs its
   aid, not only the possessor of a common nature, but rather Him who
   said, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my
   brethren, ye have done it unto me.' [303] This love sees in the sinner,
   not merely a guilty and condemned man; in one sitting in the darkness
   of spiritual death, not an uninteresting, or perhaps a repulsive
   object;--it sees in both, one made for redemption and adoption into
   God's family, one who is to be brought by it into the kingdom of God.
   This love, flowing forth in boundless fulness from Christ, has not a
   human but a Divine source. It therefore contains in it a guarantee that
   the kingdom of God will come forth victorious from all its conflicts,
   and will in the end succeed in effecting a union of the whole race.

   Thus we see that there dwells in the Person of the holy Christ, a power
   of uniting men, which effects its purpose from an inward necessity,--a
   power which first, indeed, brings together those who are His by faith,
   but which afterwards impels these to spread on all sides that salvation
   which they have themselves experienced, that all may be saved by
   Christ, and all brought into the same fellowship. It is a fellowship
   which exists only for the sake of satisfying the deepest, the universal
   needs of men: it is the kingdom of God, for it is even this which is
   visibly manifested in the Church of the Redeemed, so far as it is
   ordered according to His will and word. And where else do we find
   anything equal or even similar to this? The very idea of forming a
   society which should embrace the whole human family, never entered the
   mind of the greatest sages, or lawgivers, or founders of empires,
   before Christ. [304] And if the thought had occurred to any of these,
   which of them could have realized it? The Holy One of God, and He
   alone, could do this, because in Him alone was the true uniting power,
   and because the kingdom of God was contained in Him, and had only to
   develope itself from Him. Regarded in this light, Christ is presented
   to us as the centre of the world's history. He is this, not merely in
   that more ideal sense, according to which the whole spiritual life of
   mankind before His appearance was one continual aspiration and longing
   after Him, while all the spiritual life which has been found among men
   since His coming exhibits decided marks that He is its author; but in
   that far more real aspect in which He is beheld as the true point of
   union for the race, the life of humanity, the pulsating heart and
   quickening spirit, by means of which humanity is formed into an organic
   whole, into a body animated by the power of God, and consisting of many
   members. And it is a fact of very deep significance, that Christ makes
   it a ground of faith in His Divine mission, [305] that by union with
   Himself and with God He brings men into union among themselves; because
   a work such as this, the most noble which the human mind can conceive,
   could have proceeded from none but God.

   have been speaking is as much an ethical requirement, as those more
   limited associations which we designate as civil and political. But

   Sec. 4.--The Sinless Jesus as the Pledge of Eternal Life.

   The fellowship founded by Christ, however,--and this is the last point
   to be considered,--is not destined merely for this earthly existence,
   but has the promise of eternal life and perfect victory in a future and
   heavenly state. This promise holds good to every living member of
   Christ in particular, as well as to the community, formed of such
   members, in general. And the pledge for its performance is found in the
   sinless perfection of Him who, through what He was and what He did,
   became the sole foundation and all-comprising head of this fellowship.

   This promise is, in the first place, expressed with the utmost
   assurance by Jesus Himself. He testifies of Himself that the Father has
   given Him to have life in Himself; [306] that no one takes His life
   from Him, but that He lays it down of Himself; that He has power to lay
   it down, and power to take it again. [307] He feels certain also, that
   through sufferings and death He shall but enter into the glory which He
   had with the Father before the world was. [308] In like manner He
   represents Himself as giving life to the world, and calls Himself, in
   this very sense, the Resurrection and the Life.' [309] His people
   especially are to be sharers of His eternal life and glory. Because I
   live,' He says, ye shall live also;' [310] Where I am, there also shall
   my servant be;' [311] and, Father, I will that they also whom Thou hast
   given me be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which
   Thou hast given me.' [312] They are to attain to true life, to be
   received into everlasting habitations [313] in the Father's house of
   many mansions, where a place is prepared for them, [314] where a day
   shall come in which they shall ask nothing,' and a joy shall be
   bestowed upon them which no man shall take away from them. [315] He
   speaks of Himself as one having life in Himself, and imparting it to
   His followers, both individually and collectively, as to those who are
   with Him, and through Him, partakers of an eternal life. And this
   implies that the same may be predicated of the fellowship of His
   followers, of the Church united in Him, and founded according to His
   institution. In this sense He also very decidedly announces, though in
   the figurative manner which is in this case alone appropriate, a future
   perfect realization of the kingdom of God, [316] which, after the final
   exclusion by means of a Divine interposition--of all who persevere in
   opposing it, is to enter upon an entirely new condition. [317] At the
   same time, however, He promises also to His believing people, who,
   until this consummation takes place, are still in a state of warfare
   upon earth, that He will be with them always, even unto the end. [318]

   We now proceed to inquire whether that which is thus testified and
   promised by the Lord Jesus, is not likewise the necessary result of
   this sinless holiness,--in other words, what is the relation borne by
   this doctrine to the subject now under consideration?

   It is certain that not a few so-called Christians see in Christ nothing
   more than a historical personage, who lived more than eighteen
   centuries ago, who taught certain doctrines, and perhaps performed also
   certain unusual acts, but who--beyond what has been handed down to us
   concerning Him in this respect--does not stand in any very close and
   immediate .relation to the present generation. In such a merely
   historical Christ, they who are really in earnest in their belief in
   His words, and sincerely His followers, do assuredly possess certain
   benefits. To them, however, may well be applied the saying, Why seek ye
   the living among the dead?' And if they will but observe somewhat more
   closely the Christ presented to us in the Gospels, they will be
   constrained to admit that He declares Himself to be--and that, if but
   the chief features of His character are correctly drawn, He must
   actually be--something very different from a past historical
   phenomenon. For the actual historical Christ, and especially the Being
   who proved Himself to be sinlessly holy, necessarily implies the living
   Christ, the ever living, ever acting Christ and it is only when we
   admit this, that we really receive even the historical Christ, in the
   full completeness of all that is testified concerning Him.

   If Jesus is sinless, and consequently the holy Son of God and Son of
   Man, as He declares Himself to be, He le one whose very existence is a
   pledge of indestructible life and supreme glory. Even if He had not
   declared this, it is the necessary and direct result of His whole life.
   All that He said or did pointed to a heavenly order of things, and was
   pervaded by the powers of eternity. The wall of partition which
   conceals from us the invisible world had no existence for Him. On the
   contrary, as His life was one continuous intercourse with God, so did
   He constantly behold the eternal and imperishable, and live and act
   therein as in His proper element. Thus true life was not revealed by
   Him as something to come, but as something already present. And this
   life is, moreover, of such a nature, that not only is the thought of
   annihilation through death irreconcilably opposed thereto, but it can
   only be conceived of as, by virtue of its inherent power, eternal and
   victorious over death. The resurrection, too, and exaltation of Jesus,
   when viewed in their rightful connection with His character, cannot be
   regarded as events happening to Him merely through an external and
   miraculous interposition of God, but must also be looked upon as
   proceeding from His own intrinsic nature, as the normal development of
   that Divine and eternal life which was ever present in Him, as
   consequences which, when once the limitations of His earthly life were
   removed, were simply inevitable.

   But He who is thus exalted by the power of that Divine life which
   dwells in Him, cannot be otherwise conceived of than as the acting. And
   if even during His earthly course His agency related to the whole human
   race, the sphere of its influence cannot be a more circumscribed one,
   now that the restrictions of His earthly existence are done away with.
   We must not picture it to ourselves as similar only to that exercised
   by all whose lives have produced powerful effects upon history. Such
   persons do indeed exercise a lasting influence by means either of their
   deeds or of their intellectual productions. This, however, is not a
   direct, a living, a personal influence, but an after effect, brought
   about by historical tradition, and separate from all present connection
   with their persons,--an effect which generally becomes weaker and
   weaker in proportion to the remoteness of the ages in which they lived.
   We cannot stop at such an influence as this when we contemplate the
   Lord Jesus. For although, with respect even to this kind of influence,
   whether its depth, its extent, or its duration be considered, He
   occupies the highest place, He yet, by virtue both of His Person and of
   the work He effected, lays claim also to one of an entirely different
   kind. Through His absolute self-surrender for the good of mankind, His
   perfect obedience, and His atoning death, He has become the royal Head
   of the human race, and that not merely in a figurative, but in a real
   and living sense; and we cannot conceive of a living Head which does
   not exercise a continual influence upon its members. But besides this,
   He is also the Son of God and Son of Man--proved to be such in all the
   conflicts of life--who was perfected through sufferings, and who has
   entered through death into glory. The fulness of the Divine life and
   nature which was in Him on earth, though restricted by human
   limitation, can now freely and perfectly develope itself; and in virtue
   of the exalted position which alone becomes Him, we are constrained to
   assume that His agency is also of a Divine kind, and therefore not
   limited by time or space, nor confined to ordinary means, but direct,
   personal, and everywhere present. It is only in this sense that Christ
   can be said to be ever living, and at the same time exercising a living
   agency; and that this is actually the case, is the necessary
   consequence of that perfect and uninterrupted communion with God,
   which, by means of His sinless holiness, He ever maintained.

   But, again, we cannot conceive of the eternal life and continuous
   agency of the Head, unless the members also are partakers of eternal
   life, and susceptible of the influence of their Head. The very idea of
   a personal God, a Creator who is love, involves the admission that the
   personalities whom He has created, upon whom He has impressed His
   image, and whom He has invited to fellowship with Himself, are also
   designed for an eternal and perfect existence, and cannot be destined
   to be merely resolved into their natural elements by corporeal death.
   But the matter assumes an entirely different aspect when such
   personalities are also members of Christ, and have become intrinsically
   one with Him; and when, therefore, that life, the design and foundation
   of which was already within them, has actually begun to be realized.
   For if Christ has by His very nature eternal life in Himself, and if
   faith is that which, according to its primitive sense, it ought to
   be,--viz. the complete appropriation of the life of Christ by a perfect
   surrender to Him, so that He becomes the proper vital principle of
   every believer,--it then naturally follows that they who have entered
   into real fellowship with Him, are through Him made partakers of the
   same imperishable existence.

   But least of all can we conceive of an exalted and eternally living
   Christ, really the Head of His believing people, but unpossessed of the
   power of bringing them into His glory, and continually losing them
   through death. It would be but a very poor compensation to say: He can
   continually be taking new members to Himself as the old ones die away.
   This would be to commit the folly of conceiving not only of a heavenly
   Head with merely earthly members, but also of an eternally living Head,
   with members in a continual state of coming and going, in a condition
   of perpetual change. It is quite as impossible to combine faith in an
   actually living Christ with the supposition of the continual dying off
   of His members, as it is to supplement the idea of a living and
   personal God with the notion of the annihilation of the human
   personalities whom He has called into existence. In the latter case,
   together with a belief in personal existence after death, we are
   compelled to surrender also our belief in a personal God, who is love,
   and to abandon ourselves, if not to atheism and materialism, yet to the
   pantheistic doctrine of a universal life, ever ceaselessly changing
   between birth and death. So likewise in the former case, the eternally
   living Christ must be transformed into one who had a merely past
   existence, the after effects of which have now entirely disappeared,
   and who is therefore a historical Christ only in a very limited sense,
   before it can be maintained that His followers are destined to perish.
   Either we must say, that as believers fall a prey to annihilation, this
   must also have been the case with Christ Himself, or that because He
   lives and reigns, they shall also live and reign with Him. He has made
   them partakers of the Divine nature. He has impressed upon them the
   image of His life, and thereby imparted to them eternal life also. For
   how could that be said to be a Divine nature which was absolutely
   perishable? And how could Christ be Himself the truly living One, if
   the highest effects which have proceeded from Him in forming personal
   beings were ever and again, to be dissolved into nothingness?

   What is true of the individual members of Christ holds good also of His
   members viewed collectively, of the kingdom of God, and its
   manifestation in the Church, which is the body of Christ. From the very
   first, it was not as an isolated individual that Christ received each
   man into His fellowship, but as one who was also destined to form a
   member in His body. And this relation can never cease, but must ever
   become more real and true. As the life of the individual is perfected
   in a higher state of existence by his being made partaker in
   ever-increasing fulness of the life of Christ, even so, and in equal
   measure, must the life of the community of Christians be perfected,
   until the body of Christ is presented in perfect symmetry and beauty.
   We can never imagine a moment when the body should be left without its
   Head, or the kingdom without its King; but neither can we conceive of
   the Head existing without the body, or the King without His kingdom. If
   the kingdom of Christ, in virtue of the creative power which dwells in
   its Founder, has in Him a sure pledge of its ultimate perfection, then
   it has also in Him the assurance of an endless duration; and we have no
   alternative but either to deny that Christ is the true Kink of a real
   kingdom, or to regard Him as the immortal, eternally reigning King of
   His eternally triumphant Church.

   If what has been advanced in this last part rests upon sound reasoning,
   Jesus is thus proved to be, in virtue of His sinlessness, the One Being
   in our whole race in whom Godhead and manhood are personally united,
   and in whom a man well-pleasing to God, a typical man, has appeared.
   And if by this very fact He has also perfectly revealed the nature and
   the will of God in so far as this was needed by the world of sinners,
   and effected a true reconciliation between them and the holy God; if He
   has at the same time established upon this foundation a kingdom of God
   among men, as the highest human community, and as the guardian of His
   saving benefits, and has assured to this community, and to every living
   member thereof, a life of eternal happiness and glory,--then has He
   also fulfilled all the conditions under which alone it was possible for
   man, separated as he was from God by sin, to be readmitted to blissful
   fellowship with Him, and has done this in that form in which alone it
   could be done, in a truly vital and really efficacious manner, in the
   form of personality, of personal example and personal intervention. A
   more exalted Being than one in whom Godhead and manhood were united is
   necessarily inconceivable. He is, and ever will be, supreme in matters
   of religion, --Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.'
   [319] His mediatorial work cannot be surpassed, since the restoration
   of man to fellowship with God was actually effected. thereby. Nor can
   it possibly be regarded as needing completion. It is a perfected and
   finished salvation continually offered, that it may be appropriated and
   lived upon by all who need it.

   We have now arrived at that point which we at first designated as the
   end we had in view, and which we may now describe as the result of what
   has hitherto been stated. And this was to show that Christianity, of
   which Jesus Christ is the inalienable vital centre, and all whose
   essential elements are comprised in Him, is not merely a religion,
   which may have its own special advantages beside or above other
   religions, but that it is the religion in a supreme sense,--the perfect
   and exclusively Divine means and revelation of salvation; and that a
   supreme and satisfactory, though not the sole pledge that it is so, is
   offered by the sinless holiness of its Founder.

                                  CONCLUSION.

   THE results at which we have now arrived are not only important in a
   theoretical, but also in a practical, point of view and it is on this
   latter aspect of our subject that we now propose to add a few remarks.

   When the Apostle Peter declares to the Gentile Cornelius [320] that, in
   every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted
   of Him, this assertion implies, as the context plainly shows, not that
   every kind of worship and righteousness can in themselves render a man
   acceptable in the sight of God, but that it pleases God to receive into
   His kingdom, and into the fellowship of Christ, without respect to
   their former faith--whether they are Jews or Gentiles--all men in whom
   are found the necessary religious and moral conditions. St. Peter, like
   the other apostles, makes salvation depend, not on anything that man
   can offer by way of worship or righteousness, but upon Christ alone.
   This is unanswerably shown by his immediately following discourse, as
   well as by his other most express declaration, that there is salvation
   in none other, and none other name under heaven given among men,
   whereby we must be saved.' [321] In these very words is given the
   summary of all that our previous arguments are designed to prove.

   If, then, the Person of Christ has this all-deciding importance with
   respect to the salvation both of the individual and the whole race, it
   is obvious that everything will depend upon the position occupied with
   respect to His Person. Evidently this position cannot be merely a
   matter of knowledge; it must, on the contrary, be a matter of the
   heart, the will, and the conscience, because that which concerns our
   supreme relation, our relation to God, claims not only our intellect,
   but our entire personality, and especially its moral centre.

   To occupy no position at all with respect to the Person of Jesus, when
   once we have become acquainted with it, is simply impossible; for there
   is in the holy a power which can never be utterly inoperative; and man,
   even in his present sinful condition, is a moral being possessing an
   ineradicable tendency towards the Divine. As such, he is so constituted
   that he is incapable of remaining absolutely indifferent to that which
   is holy when he actually meets with it, or when it is powerfully
   brought to his knowledge. He can avert, or forcibly close, his
   spiritual eye; yet if but a ray of holy light penetrates his soul, he
   cannot possibly conduct himself as if there were no such thing in
   existence, but must necessarily take up some position with respect
   thereto.

   And this position cannot, at least for a continuance, be a neutral or
   an undecided one. The Lord, indeed, when He says, He that is not
   against us, is on our side,' [322] seems to assert the opposite, viz.
   that conduct which just stops short of being inimical, deserves a
   certain amount of approbation. This saying, however, refers solely to
   the external following of Christ in combination with His disciples,--to
   the relation maintained to Christianity viewed in its corporate aspect.
   Where, however, the far more important and internal relation of the
   individual to the Person of Christ is concerned, that testing and
   severing saying, He that is not with me is against me, and he that
   gathereth not with me scattereth abroad,' [323] applies. The very
   nature of the case makes it impossible that it should be otherwise. In
   presence of the holy and the Divine, the human soul has no other
   alternative than for or against, affection or dislike; a joyful
   acceptance of the benefits therein offered, or a repellent withdrawal
   into itself, followed by an ever-increasing aversion, which at last
   becomes open enmity. Thus did the manifestation of Jesus, even during
   His earthly career, act with a dividing effect upon all hearts and
   minds, and reveal their inmost thoughts and dispositions; thus, to this
   very day, does it, wherever it is faithfully testified to, irresistibly
   compel a decision. This decision may indeed be delayed or postponed;
   the soul of man may hesitate between the Holy One of God and the world;
   but a decision must at last take place; and if it is not made by an
   express resolution of the will, a continuance of not being with Christ
   is in itself a being against Him, and must inevitably manifest itself
   to be such with more and more distinctness.

   But in what does being with and for Him really consist? Not in a merely
   esthetic approbation of His character, but in a hearty love of His
   Person. If this is indeed lin us, we shall be willing, first of all, to
   allow ourselves to be convinced of, and thoroughly humbled for, our
   sins by Him, the Holy One, and shall then surrender ourselves in
   perfect confidence to Him who is also the Son, full of grace and truth,
   and willingly and thankfully accept at His hands the gifts of
   forgiveness, life, and salvation, which He offers without our merits or
   deservings. But this is nothing else than what is called believing in
   Him. And thus the only rightful position which we can occupy towards
   Christ, the position all-decisive with respect to our own salvation, is
   that of faith. But faith thus understood can be none other than a
   living faith, fruitful in all good works. For when a man thus wholly
   surrenders himself to Christ, Christ really imparts Himself to him:
   such a one receives the life of Christ into himself, and lets himself
   be ruled by Christ's Spirit. And where the Spirit of Christ is, His
   love is shed abroad in the heart; and the works of this love naturally
   follow. From such a faith there is no need to require good works:
   Neither does it inquire whether good works are to be done; but before
   they are asked for, it has done, and is ever doing them.' [324]

   Let him who refuses this faith clearly understand what such refusal
   involves. There is, as we have seen, no neutral ground to which he can
   retire. In his, as in every case, there will at last arise the
   necessity of deciding for or against. He, too, will be compelled either
   to open his heart, by trustful self-surrender and humility, to the Holy
   One of God, or to close it against Him; and having turned away from
   Him, to seek salvation--if indeed he still feels himself in need of
   it--in ways of his own devising. If, however, he decides for the
   latter, he should do so with a clear knowledge of the full significance
   of his choice. Perhaps he may think it possible to give up Christ, the
   Son of God and Redeemer of the world, and to retain the pure and holy
   Son of Man as an example. This, however, is not possible; for it is the
   pure and perfect Son of Man who testifies of Himself that He is the Son
   of God, the Mediator, the alone source of salvation. Besides, it is
   precisely His pure and perfect manhood which leads, by an inward
   necessity, to His Divine dignity, and to the truth and reality of His
   redeeming work, and which involves and furnishes the surest guarantee
   of both. In short, we cannot have the one without the other. For when
   we have set aside the Son of God and the Redeemer of the world, there
   is no longer a place for the holy Son of Man. Then the only perfectly
   pure specimen of humanity is taken out of its midst, and its whole
   process of development lacks that central point after which it is ever
   striving, and from which, when it is once obtained, it receives its
   deepest, its creative impulse. Then all previous hopes and aspirations
   that a true man, a man as God had willed him, would one day really
   appear, have been but an empty delusion; all faith that such a one has
   really appeared--a faith which has made men strong in life, and joyful
   in death--has been childish folly. Then the heart of man may look in
   vain in the midst of its sorrows for a Divine, a holy, but also a truly
   human heart, which it can entirely trust, to which it can unreservedly
   surrender itself, and from which it may receive full comfort and
   perfect peace, in life and in death.

   Of him who, on the contrary, inclines to this faith, it demands that he
   should embrace it with his whole heart, and in the full extent of its
   requirements. The Redeemer will not be satisfied with a divided heart.
   He who gave Himself wholly to us, desires that we also should give
   ourselves wholly to Him. He who receives Him, must do so in a manner
   suited to His sacred dignity,--must accept from Him that which He is
   willing to bestow. For He is not here to be fashioned and formed
   according to the desires and fancies of those who need His salvation,
   but they must let themselves be formed and fashioned, or rather
   transformed and refashioned, in their inmost nature and being, by Him,
   and thus become recipients of the true basis of all true and exalted
   human progress. Neither is it His will that faith should be timidly
   concealed in the inner sanctuary of the heart. He would have it gladly
   confessed before men, and shining forth like a bright light from the
   whole walk and conversation. [325] He, moreover, who is with Christ,
   must also gather' with Him; that is, he must diligently promote the
   interests of His kingdom, and lend his aid to propagate more and more
   widely the saving and cleansing virtue which proceeds from Christ. Not
   one special class alone is called to this work. All believers must,
   after the example of the one High Priest, offer spiritual sacrifices,
   both in their actions and persons, and show forth the praises of Him
   who hath called them out of darkness into His marvellous light. [326]
   Only in proportion as this general Christian duty is fulfilled, in
   addition to the regular agency of those who are officially called to
   spread the knowledge of Christ, will the whole fellowship continue to
   grow up into Him who is the Head; only thus will be laid the foundation
   of a faith realized and perfected in Him, and the life of the sinless
   and Holy One be, by means of this faith, increasingly imparted to
   mankind.

THE HISTORY AND LITERATURE OF THE SUBJECT.

   THE great importance of the sinlessness of Jesus, with regard both to
   Christian faith and to that impression thereof which we designate
   doctrine, has at no time been ignored. The attention paid to it,
   however, by Christian teachers and theologians, has been by no means
   uniform. The importance of the fact, and its manifold consequences,
   have not been at all times equally perceived, while its relation to
   other elements of Christianity has been variously estimated, and its
   treatment has been undertaken with different purposes and in different
   manners.

   A complete statement of the various ways and modes in which the dogma
   of the sinlessness of Jesus has in different ages been viewed, proved,
   and applied, carried out with relation to the whole course of
   development which doctrine and practice have gone through in the
   Church, might well form the subject of a separate treatise of no slight
   interest. Such an undertaking would far transcend our limits. We feel,
   however, that it is due to our subject to follow up the allusions given
   in the Introduction by a few general outlines, and especially to make
   the notice there given of its literature more complete.

   To the Christians of the apostolic age, and to the most distinguished
   of the apostles, the sinless perfection of their Master was an
   inalienable element, nay, a fundamental factor, of their faith in Him
   as the Messiah sent by God, the Son of God and Son of Man, the
   Reconciler and Redeemer of mankind. With them it was not a subject of
   reflection. They merely reproduced in very decided and pregnant
   statements the impression which Jesus had in this respect made upon
   themselves, and plainly indicated the inseparable connection existing
   in their eyes between His; sinlessness and other elements of
   Christianity, especially the atoning and priestly agency of Christ.

   In the further development of the doctrine of Christ within the Church,
   this apostolic view of the subject continued to prevail. A more
   explicit reference to the doctrine of the sinlessness of Jesus,
   especially in its historical bearings, was nowhere attempted; because
   it was regarded as an absolutely sell-evident fact, and as an article
   of belief essentially interwoven with the whole organism of the
   Christian religion. But as soon as the doctrine of the Person of Christ
   began to be more fully elaborated, this article of belief was most
   prominently brought forward. [327] We find this already in the writings
   of Irenæus and Tertullian, of Clement and Origen. [328] But they give
   the subject a different form and position. Generally the difference is
   this: either the sinlessness of Christ is inferred from His Divinity,
   as by Tertullian; or it is regarded, as by Origen, as a peculiar
   property of the human soul of Jesus,--a property resulting from a free
   undisturbed love of all that was Divine and good, and making that soul
   capable and worthy of perfect union with the Divine, eternal Logos.

   In the Christology of Apollinaris this doctrine has a peculiar import
   attached to it. He proceeded from the belief that along with human
   nature there is always mutability and change in the moral life, gradual
   development, conflict, and therefore sin: in his view, it is impossible
   to conceive of a complete man without sin. But as, according to his own
   belief, the Redeemer of men must Himself be free from all sin, nay,
   elevated above all conflict therewith, he was thus led to form the
   opinion, that in Christ the Divine and eternal Logos had taken the
   place of the necessarily vacillating and sinful human soul. This Logos
   being in itself immutable and self-determined, is thus supposed to have
   imparted to every action and emotion of Christ an irresistible tendency
   towards the holy and the Divine, and to have raised Him above all
   conflict with sin. Now even if by the adoption of this view the
   doctrine of the sinlessness of Christ seems to be placed upon a firmer
   basis, an evident injury is thereby done to another most vital
   doctrine, namely, that of the perfect humanity of Christ, and the truth
   of His typical character as a real man; because both these truths rest
   upon the assumption of a rational human soul in Christ.

   Hence the importance of holding fast the doctrine of Christ's
   sinlessness along with that of His true human nature. Both were fully
   recognised by Athanasius, who directed attention to the fact that sin,
   although found by experience to be really present in all mankind, yet
   belongs not to human nature in itself considered, whose original state
   was, on the contrary, a state of sinlessness. Hence it was possible for
   Christ to take upon Him the whole nature of man, without thereby
   becoming subject to sin; nay, He must have done so, in order that He
   might thus show that it was possible for one who is entirely human to
   preserve himself free from sin. Since His time, both truths have
   continued to be recognised in the Church--the perfect manhood of
   Christ, and His absolute sinlessness. In the creed of Chalcedon (451)
   this doctrine first found expression as an article of faith. In this
   creed, while testimony is at the same time borne to His proper
   Divinity, Christ is spoken of as truly man, with a rational soul and
   body, of like essence with us as to His manhood, and in all things like
   us, sin excepted.'

   This settled the doctrine, at least within the domain of the Church and
   no important change of opinion with respect. to it afterwards took
   place. It now became more a subject of theological discussion, although
   it was not treated in a comprehensive spirit until modern times.

   In the Middle Ages, theologians were content to abide by the decisions
   of the Church; but at the same time they fully recognised the
   importance of the subject. The Schoolmen indeed allowed, that if the
   human soul of Jesus were viewed independently, and its union with the
   Divine Logos left out of the question, the possibility of His sinning
   could not be denied. [329] On the other hand, however, the fact of His
   perfect sinlessness was most expressly acknowledged. This feature was
   prominently brought forward as a thoroughly essential one in the
   character of Jesus from the most opposite quarters, [330] and we may
   regard it as not improbable that, in the well-known controversy of the
   Thomists and the Scotists about the immaculate conception of the
   Virgin, one chief point of interest for the defenders of that tenet
   was, by proving the perfect original purity of the mother of our Lord,
   to establish that also of the Saviour Himself. But this dogma was
   damaging to the position of Christ in another aspect. For hitherto
   Christ alone, according to apostolic testimony, had been regarded as
   free from all sin, hereditary sin included. Now, however, this quality
   began to be attributed to His mother and thus not only was the
   uniqueness of Christ in this respect done away with, but His dignity as
   the world's Redeemer was impugned, together with the indissoluble
   connection between the work of redemption and absolute sinlessness. For
   if there really existed a human being . besides, nay, before Him,
   entirely unaffected by sin, the necessity of being redeemed and
   sanctified by Christ would be no longer absolute and universal.
   Consequently His position as Redeemer would be lowered and though this
   took place in fact only at a single point, yet in principle the whole
   doctrine would be affected. That this was the case was immediately felt
   and expressed. At the very first appearance even of the dogma of the
   immaculate conception, St. Bernhard despatched an epistle to the
   Canonist of Lyon, who had about the year 1400 introduced a new festival
   in honour of this doctrine, in which, among other things, he says: If
   it is given to some few of the sons of men to be born in holiness, it
   is not given them to be thus conceived, that thus this pre-eminence of
   holy conception might continue to be His alone who was to sanctify all,
   and who alone coming into the world without sin, was to effect the
   purification of sinners.' In a similar manner do several other
   excellent authorities express themselves; among whom we may specially
   name the Dominican John of Montesono, who, in 1367, published at Paris
   several theses on this controversy. [331] The movement, however,
   continued, and an increasingly idolatrous honouring of the Virgin
   prevailed, until at last, in our own days, though not without a partial
   protest by the more pious and enlightened of Romish theologians, the
   dogma of the immaculate conception was formally promulgated by the
   Roman see.

   While the theology of the Middle Ages continued in theory unwaveringly
   faithful to the decisions of the apostolic, and the ancient Church
   concerning the Person of Christ, a corruption of another kind set in;
   not, in the first instance, within the sphere of theology, but in that
   of the Church and of Christian life generally. Christ, while strictly
   adhered to doctrinally, began to disappear from Christian consciousness
   as a living, directly operating personality, and as the only medium of
   salvation. The Church, with its mediation of priests, put Him more and
   more into the background, while His pretended earthly representative
   usurped His place. The chief merit of the Reformers consisted in
   restoring the Divine and human Person of Christ to its central position
   as the one only ground of salvation, and re-establishing the direct
   character of the relation of believers to Him, and, through Him, to God
   the Father. They did this, because they felt Christ present to their
   inmost soul in His Divine and human dignity, in His redeeming and
   saving power; and they sought for no further proof of that which was to
   them a second nature, and which was confirmed and sealed by the word of
   God and the testimony of His Spirit. They received the doctrine
   concerning Christ as set forth by the Church,--the Church universally
   Christian and truly catholic; and since the sinlessness of Christ
   formed an essential part of that doctrine, we find it also enunciated
   in their writings. [332] A minute discussion of it would, however, have
   been at variance with their spirit; to them it was not a matter
   requiring proof, but an immediate certainty, far removed above all
   controversy. As soon, however, as evangelical doctrine was formed into
   a systematic whole, this dogma had to undergo a more thorough
   discussion. This is first found in the writings of the dogmaticians of
   the second generation after the Reformation; [333] and not less so in
   those of subsequent systematizers, particularly in works on doctrinal
   and on moral theology. But it is in modern times that the subject has
   been most prominently brought forward, owing to the growing
   consciousness of the extreme importance of the doctrine of sinlessness
   in treating of Christology, and indeed of Christianity in general.
   [334]

   And nothing has done more to awaken this conviction than the doubts
   which have arisen in recent times upon this subject, even within the
   domain of Christian belief and of theology. Indeed the development of
   the doctrine which we have sketched above had not been carried far
   enough for the sinlessness of Christ to be at once recognised by all
   men, at all times, as a perfectly unquestionable fact. As early as the
   ages of ancient Christianity, we see suspicions arising and limitations
   adduced in isolated instances. [335] But it is in modern times that we
   first find the doctrine an object of decided and detailed attack. And
   here we have not so much in view the application--made with greater or
   less directness against the sinlessness of Christ--of the position,
   that Christ did actually share our sinful flesh; [336] we rather refer
   to the direct calling in question of sinlessness as a possibility and
   as a fact, as it has been called in question by rationalism, both
   deistic and pantheistic. [337]

   These doubts, based as they were, not only upon historical and
   critical, but upon very decided and utterly negative doctrinal
   prepossessions, assailed the very heart of Christianity; and there
   could not fail to be a reaction against them from the Christian side.
   If, in former times, the moral character of Christ had often been the
   subject of special discussion, this. was now of necessity much more the
   case; and we find a whole series of single works upon this subject,
   with direct reference to the question of sinlessness. [338] But not
   only were more numerous works thus called forth,--there was also a more
   acute apprehension of the idea of sinlessness, and a more profound
   investigation of the questions involved in it. Nevertheless, two
   distinct modes of treatment were followed; some theologians dealing
   with the subject in a manner purely doctrinal, while others, taking it
   up chiefly in its historical aspect, used it also in the interest of
   apologetic aims. In the former aspect, the influence of Schleiermacher
   in itself marks a fresh era. He, as is well known, defines Christianity
   as fundamentally a system of redemption, and makes redemption consist
   essentially in the communication of the sinlessness of the Redeemer. In
   doing this, however, he not only specially vindicated, for the doctrine
   of Christ's sinlessness, a position which, however modified, will still
   retain its importance; but he gave to the discussion of this doctrine
   an impulse which has caused the feature of sinlessness in the character
   of Jesus to be regarded, in general, in a manner totally different from
   that in which it had hitherto been viewed, and has placed this
   essential trait in a point of view more particularly apologetic. The
   manner in which it has been treated in more modern times, in this
   latter aspect, need not, after what has been stated in the Introduction
   and notes, be further alluded to here.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [327] The first writer who uses the technical expression anamartetos
   with reference to Christ is Hippolytus (Galandii Biblioth. 466). Then
   we find the term repeatedly employed by Clement of Alexandria; still he
   uses also the word anepithumetos (Stromat. vii. 12),--a word which,
   more than the other, has reference to the inward state.

   [328] It would lead us too much into detail were we to give all the
   passages of the fathers referred to. The reader may consult Duncker's
   Christologie des Irenæus, S. 219 ff.; Hagenbach, Dogmen-geschichte, B.
   1. § 67; and Baumgarten-Crusius' Dogmen-geschichte, vol. ii. p. 162.
   Suicer also, in his Thesaurus Ecclesiasticus, gives a tolerably
   complete collection of passages from the fathers under the words
   anamartesia, anamartetos,--vol. 1. pp. 287-289.

   [329] Peter Lombard says, Lib. sent. iii. 12: Non est ambiguum, animam
   illam entem unitam verbo peccare non posse, et eandem, si esset et non
   unita verbo, posse peccare.

   [330] This was to be expected in the case of theologians. I will here
   name only two poets: Otfried von Weissenburg, who, in his Poetical
   Version of the Gospels, iii. 21, 4, uses the expression, ther suntiloso
   man, concerning Christ; and Dante, in whose view Christ is like Himself
   alone, and who on this account never makes his name rhyme with any word
   but itself, nor permits it to be uttered in hell on account of its
   supreme dignity, says, Inferno, xxxiv. 114, 15, Where the man who was
   born and lived without sin, perished.'

   [331] These may be found in Dupin's edition of the works of Gerson,
   vol. 1. p. 693. In thesis x. it is said, It is expressly contrary to
   our faith to hold that any except Christ has been born free from
   original sin;' and in thesis xii., It is as contrary to Holy Scripture
   to say that one human being besides Christ is excepted from original
   sin, as to say that ten are.' In thesis ix., moreover, it is laid down
   as a general axiom, that, to declare anything true which is contrary to
   Scripture, is most expressly contrary to our faith.'

   [334] Among the works of the older Protestant theologians the following
   may be specially noticed:--Gerhard, Loc. theol. Pt. iii. p. 237; and
   Buddeus, Compend. theol. dogm. § 497. Among modern writings in which
   the doctrine is briefly or extensively treated, may be

   Iscarioth, No. I. pp. 55, 64, 78; and Steudel's Grundzügen einer
   Apologetik, pp. 56, etc. It is also discussed in Steudel's
   Glaubenslehre der evangelisch-protestant-Kirche, Tüb. 1834, pp.
   233-245; in Sack's christl. Apologetik, 2d ed. p. 201, etc.; Hase's
   Leben Jesu, pp. 23, 32; and Jul. Müller's christl. Lehre von der Sünde,

   Entwickelungsgeschichte der Lehre von der Person Christi; and
   Schumann's Christus, vol. i. pp. 284-297.

   [335] Basilides, the Gnostic, appears to have been the first who
   entertained doubts concerning this doctrine. He even applied to Christ,
   as man, the maxim that every one who suffers, does so as an expiation
   for his own sins. Yet he shrinks from charging Jesus with actual sin,
   and places Him, in this respect, on a level with children, who suffer
   indeed, not on account of sins committed, but because of the
   inclination to sin existing in them,--because of the hamartetikon.
   Clemens, Strom. iv. 12; Neander, gnost. Syst. pp. 49-53. Arius and
   Theodore of Mopsveste admit only the moral perfection of Christ in a
   more limited sense. See Baumgarten-Crusius, Dogmengeschichte, p. 164,
   note 1.

   [336] See on this subject the note on p. 125.

   [337] The Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist is, with respect to our subject, the
   advocate of the former; Strauss, in his Glaubenslehre, vol. ii. pp.
   190, etc., of the latter. Pécaut, whose still more recent work has been
   already so frequently alluded to, may also be mentioned as belonging to
   the deistic side.

   [338] Among works entirely devoted to this subject are the

   scholastic acuteness. It follows Wolf's method of demonstration, and

II.

THE DIFFERENT VIEWS HELD WITH RESPECT TO THE TEMPTATION.
     __________________________________________________________________

   THE object of the brief notice given in the Treatise, of the history of
   the temptation, was principally to point out the relation between the
   fact of our Saviour being tempted and His sinlessness. We endeavoured
   to show what aspect this relation bears, as seen from the various
   points of view occupied by those who have discussed the two subjects
   and with this purpose we referred even to those opinions which present
   the greatest difficulty. But what was there said would be insufficient
   and unsatisfactory without a further investigation of the whole
   subject. We subjoin, accordingly, an examination of the various
   expositions of this passage, [339] and supply a fuller vindication of
   the view which, in our opinion, deserves the preference.

   Everywhere in the Bible the exposition of the details, and the view to
   be taken of the whole, reciprocally modify each other and this is
   especially the case with reference to the passage before us. But while,
   as is evident, the details can be fully understood only by a correct
   appreciation of the whole, there is a great danger of allowing one's
   self to be influenced in fixing the meaning of the separate histories
   by a predetermined conclusion on the import of the whole narrative.
   That we may avoid this danger, and pursue the safest course, we shall
   first state what can with certainty be determined with regard to the
   details, and then proceed to the general history, that thus justice may
   be done to both, by a due consideration of their mutual relation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [339] The most recent literature on the subject of the temptation has
   been given above, p. 130, to which may be added Riggenbach's Lectures
   on the Life of Christ, pp. 271-286. More information may be found in
   Hase's Life of Jesus, and De Wette's Exegetical Handbook. Specially
   rich in literary notices is a treatise in the (Catholic) Tübinger
   Quartalschrift, 1828, 1 and 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

  CHAPTER I.

  EXPLANATION OF THE DETAILS.

   IN the first .place, there arises the question as to the meaning of the
   several temptations. This has, as is well known, been made the theme of
   frequent discussion. And yet the opinions even of the most recent
   commentators differ so widely, that it may well repay our trouble if we
   submit this point to a more minute investigation.

   The temptation which both Matthew and Luke agree in giving as the
   first, consists in the call addressed to Jesus to change stones into
   bread. Now it is self-evident that such a temptation, if it were to
   have any meaning, could only be made under certain conditions.
   Manifestly the person to whom it was addressed must, on the one hand,
   have been so constituted that he could feel a want of food, which at
   that moment could not be gratified in any ordinary way; and again, he
   must have been one who was supposed to possess the power of satisfying
   that want in an extraordinary and miraculous manner. Now, to the former
   of these conditions, the intimation of the evangelist, that Jesus was
   then an hungered, and that He was in the desert, where the ordinary
   means of support were wanting, exactly corresponds; the latter, again,
   we find in the opening words of the temptation, If Thou be the Son of
   God,' which at once bespeak a personality possessed of supernatural
   powers. Hence this temptation may be represented as follows: it was an
   attempt to persuade a person endowed with miraculous power, to use that
   power for the purpose of satisfying his bodily wants; and the point
   against which this attempt was directed, was the urgent physical need
   which he was at the time suffering. It is obvious that the need which
   the miraculous power was to supply was that of the person tempted; for
   though it has been remarked [340] that this is not expressly stated,
   yet this omission is of no importance,--a matter so self-evident
   requiring no mention, and being sufficiently implied by the previous
   allusion to the fact that Jesus was an hungered. For whose wants could
   even Jesus have wrought a miracle at this juncture but for His own? Is
   it replied, For those of the members of His kingdom, or of the needy
   multitude in general? There were as yet no members of His kingdom, and
   neither a smaller or greater number of people were just now at hand.
   Besides, if the temptation had related to such a supply, our Lord did
   not remain faithful to the principle with which He repelled it, for the
   Gospel history narrates several instances in which He relieved the
   temporal necessities of the people in a miraculous manner.

   We now proceed to a closer inquiry as to the manner in which Jesus met
   the proposal. We may anticipate that His answer will throw some light
   upon the nature of the temptation itself. But here we are met by
   several conflicting opinions. The retort of Jesus is expressed in words
   taken from Deut. viii. 3: Man doth not live by bread alone, but by
   every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.'
   The majority of commentators understand the meaning of these words to
   be this: The preservation of the life of man is not necessarily
   connected with the ordinary means of subsistence, but it can be
   sustained without bread by the word, i.e. commandment, that proceeds
   from the mouth of God, in an extraordinary way, as the Israelites were
   sustained by manna in the wilderness. [341] This explanation does
   certainly correspond with the meaning of the words as they occur in
   Deuteronomy, taken along with their context. Yet we have good ground
   for asking whether we are restricted to this meaning alone when the
   words are reproduced by Jesus Christ: There can be no doubt that Jesus
   and His apostles often made use of passages of the Old Testament in a
   freer and a spiritual sense,--that they frequently gave them a more
   general application, and raised them altogether into a higher sphere.
   And there is reason enough to suppose that this is the case in the
   passage before us.

   In the explanation usually given, a special import is attached to the
   fact that Jesus was requested to make in a miraculous manner, not any
   kind of food, but only bread, for the satisfaction of His hunger. But
   this is clearly incorrect. The question is not as to His appeasing His
   hunger by means of bread in particular, but as to His doing so by any
   means, and as to His employing miraculous agency for that purpose.
   Among the various kinds of food by which this might have been effected,
   bread is mentioned, partly as being the most general and symbolical of
   all other nourishment, and partly on account of the resemblance of
   loaves to the stones which were to be transformed into bread. The
   antithesis is certainly not between bread and any other means of
   supporting life, but between it and the word of God; in other words,
   between the means of bodily nourishment (actual bread) and the means of
   spiritual nourishment (every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
   God; in other words, the bread of life). Again, the words, not by bread
   alone,' in that higher application of them as used by our Lord to repel
   the temptation now presented to Him, are not to be understood of bread
   merely as bread, but of bodily nourishment, as that to which man is not
   to be exclusively referred for the maintenance of life, in opposition
   to that which imparts spiritual life. Thus, when Jesus is asked by the
   tempter to make His power to do miracles available for supplying His
   physical wants, to use the higher, God-given faculty in the service of
   mere human self-gratification, He replies, in a spirit of freedom and
   self-denial which triumphs over the merely sensible want: No; for there
   is a higher life which is not upheld by any outward nourishment, but
   which lives by all that comes from the mouth of God. In these words He
   says essentially the same thing which He afterwards expressed thus: My
   meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work.'
   [342]

   The temptation which in St. Luke occupies the third place, is--more
   correctly, as there can be no doubt--placed second in St. Matthew.
   This, as well as the former, has been variously explained. This
   temptation consisted in a summons addressed to Christ to cast Himself
   from the pinnacle of the temple, and, like the first, is based upon the
   assumption of a peculiar personality in Jesus in other words, it
   presupposes that the Tempted was, as the Son of God,'--the Sent of
   God,--under the special care and protection of Jehovah. Many have
   supposed that Jesus was here asked to perform an epideiktical
   miracle,--a show miracle. In favour of this view there is adduced not
   only the character of the miracle demanded, which is something quite
   exorbitant, but the fact that the contemporaries of Jesus did actually
   require from Him, in corroboration of His Divine mission, signs from
   Heaven. We must, however, decidedly reject this interpretation,
   although we formerly held it to be the correct one. [343] In the first
   place, it is clear that, in order to an epideiktical miracle,
   spectators who should be sensibly overpowered by the manifestation were
   indispensable, whereas throughout the whole scene we do not read of any
   one being present. There is, also, another consideration to be borne in
   mind: when the tempter calls upon Jesus to throw Himself down from the
   temple because God would protect Him by His angels, it is not so much
   to the wonder-working power of Jesus Himself that he appeals, as to the
   miraculous help of God. His proposition is not that Jesus should
   perform some unheard-of miracle, but that He should expose Himself to
   an evident danger. If in this temptation also the chief stress is
   placed upon the employment of miraculous power, there would, since this
   formed the turning-point of the first temptation, be nothing really new
   in it, but a mere repetition, though in an aggravated form. But this
   view of the temptation is best refuted by the passages from Scripture
   employed on the occasion, whether that by which the tempter supported
   his demand, [344] or that by which the Saviour repelled it. [345] The
   former contains not a trace of allusion to any popular approbation to
   be gained by the performance of a miracle, but solely to the Divine
   protection, under which the Beloved of Jehovah stood. The latter gives
   not even a remote hint of the impropriety of a miracle for such a
   purpose, but only points out how impious it would be to tempt God by
   throwing one's self needlessly in the way of danger.

   The enticing element in this temptation was the idea of calling forth
   the Divine protection,--of proving whether God would preserve His
   anointed Son in circumstances of most imminent danger, and that a
   danger which did not come in the simple, God-appointed path of duty,
   but was arbitrarily and vaingloriously incurred. [346] There can be no
   doubt that a temptation like this has a certain charm for men who feel
   penetrated with a consciousness that they have a special mission to
   perform; and many a one whom an idea like this has blinded, has
   precipitated himself from very exalted pinnacles into the abyss of
   perdition. Thus the attempt might well be made with Jesus,--who, though
   pre-eminently the Sent of God, was yet truly man,--to test whether the
   thought of putting the Divine protection to the utmost proof had any
   attraction for Him; and this attempt constitutes the second temptation.
   In it we have vividly brought before us the contrast between a true and
   sound confidence in God, by virtue of which even one who is conscious
   of a Divine mission will walk in none but ways of God's appointment,
   and that rash presumption, by which a man is misled, while invoking the
   Divine protection, to rush into self-chosen danger.

   We have now to speak of the third temptation. This is rightly put last
   by St. Matthew, for it obviously forms the climax of the whole, and in
   it the tempter appears in an undisguised form. The devil calls upon the
   Saviour to worship him, and promises that, if He does so, he will give
   Him all the kingdoms of the world. The temptation here has been
   generally held to consist in the invitation to found an earthly
   kingdom,--an external theocracy, instead of the true inner kingdom of
   God which Christ had come to establish. But another view has also been
   maintained. It has been said that the question whether the kingdom to
   be founded should be an earthly and external, or a heavenly and
   spiritual one, is not introduced into the temptation; that, on the
   contrary, the seductive element really lay in the fact that, for the
   acquirement of a sway which might in itself be good, a bad means, a
   submission to Satan, a doing homage to him, was to be employed. [347]
   This exposition is correct, if we are to confine our view to the words
   spoken by Satan. But this we cannot do: we must contemplate these words
   in the connection in which they stand, and under the supposition from
   which they are spoken. Immediately before, we read that Satan had shown
   our Lord the kingdoms of the world and their glory. Now, to go no
   further than this expression, the glory' of the kingdoms of the world
   which he showed, of itself points to a kingdom, not of self-denying
   love, but of splendid dominion, and thus to a mere outward kingdom.
   Besides, Satan appears here as the prince of the world, [348] and
   offers to transfer to Christ his sovereignty over it. Now such a
   kingdom as he could possess [349] and offer, must from its very nature
   have been a merely earthly, external, ungodly kingdom. A sovereignty
   received from Satan could only be one opposed to the dominion of the
   true kingdom of God; and he who could desire such a sovereignty must
   have been willing to enter into a league with the devil, and render him
   homage. In the idea of worshipping the devil, viewed in itself, there
   could be nothing alluring, nothing tempting; and if the evangelical
   record brings prominently forward the proposed homage of our Lord to
   Satan, it can only be because there was something to be obtained by
   this homage which might prove attractive and ensnaring; and this was
   the world-dominion which was in this way to be attained.

   The dominion of the world is thus the great object here presented by
   the devil, but at the same time he states what is the only way whereby
   it could be gained. And the way is unquestionably bad, for it is by
   subjection to the prince of the world. And in rejecting it, which He
   does by a reference to the great truth, that to God alone, the Lord of
   all, are homage and worship due, Jesus at the same time renounces the
   object which could only thus be arrived at. We see, then, that in this
   temptation a kingdom of outward glory is offered to Jesus, as to One,
   who must in the fullest sense be regarded as destined to be a king. And
   the whole turns upon the antagonism between a kingdom of the world
   which could be set up only by the use of worldly means, and the kingdom
   of God which could be founded only by the total rejection of such
   means, by the pure worship of God alone.

   If we now briefly sum up what has been said, we shall find that in the
   three temptations the following alternatives were presented. In the
   first, the use of supernatural gifts for the purposes of sensuous
   self-love; or a complete entrance upon a life of self-denial, which
   expects support and strength from God alone. In the second, a
   presumptuous reliance upon Divine assistance, which, in the
   consciousness of a special mission, enters upon self-chosen paths of
   danger; or a pious confiding in God, which shuns all devious,
   God-tempting courses, and meekly follows in the prescribed paths of
   duty. In the third, the acquisition of worldly might and glory by means
   of the world and its prince; or contempt both of this end and the means
   by which it must be won, for the sake of living only for the service of
   God, and the establishment of His kingdom.

   Having thus determined the meaning of the three temptations, the
   question now arises as to whom they concern. It may be thought that
   this is quite a superfluous question, as it is so clearly and
   emphatically stated that it was Jesus who was the object of the devil's
   assaults. Yet some have thought otherwise. Some have taken exception to
   the possibility of Jesus being tempted at all, others to the particular
   form of temptation recorded in the Gospel. Consequently they have
   regarded the alternatives expressed above, as intended to form merely a
   symbolical representation of the fundamental. principles of His
   kingdom, [350] or of certain maxims essential to the usefulness of its
   members in general, and of the apostles in particular. Now there is a
   certain amount of truth in this view, inasmuch as whatever belongs to
   the Founder of the kingdom of God has a typical character, and
   intimately concerns all its members. But the principal validity and
   import of the temptation was in reference to Him who was its Founder.
   If in our treatment of the temptation we pass Him by, and apply the
   whole immediately to His kingdom and its members, we manifestly put a
   forced interpretation upon the narrative, and violate the natural
   sense, not only of this portion of the history of Christ, but also of
   the whole apostolic Christology.

   It being thus apparent that it was Jesus Himself who was the subject of
   the temptation, the next question that arises is: Was it chiefly as the
   Messiah, or as a man, that He was tempted? And here, too, opinions are
   divided. There are still, in the present day, writers who think that
   the proposals made to Jesus were temptations of a general human
   character. [351] But it is manifest that these temptations presuppose
   in the Person tempted a very peculiar character and destiny,--a Person
   destined and endowed to be the Founder of the kingdom of God. But if
   there can remain no doubt in the minds of the unprejudiced that the
   temptation of Jesus was the testing of the Messiah, it is quite as
   certain--as we have already shown [352] --that there could have been no
   real and actual temptations unless addressed at the same time to His
   human nature. Both sides of His nature must be regarded as concerned in
   it, if we are to reach a full view of the truth. [353]

   Although it was to Jesus Himself that the temptation immediately and
   chiefly referred, its bearings are not confined to Him. For He is not
   an isolated individual, but the type of His kingdom and its members:
   hence this narrative has a more general and typical significance.
   Considered as a testing of the Messiah, the temptation must be of
   importance for the kingdom of Messiah, and typical for its members. The
   principles which the Founder of the kingdom of God opposed to the
   assaults of the devil, are also the principles of His kingdom, and
   maxims for the guidance of its members. And these we have seen to be
   self-denial and devotion to the service of God, and a life sustained by
   the word of His mouth; a confidence in God which renounces all
   arbitrary self-will and presumption, and walks in ways appointed by
   Him; and an unconditional devotion to the service of God, labouring in
   His strength for the interests of His true kingdom,--a kingdom which is
   to unfold itself from within.

   But since Christ could be tempted as Messiah only in so far as He could
   be tempted as a man, we must own that this history of His temptation
   has in it something also of a more general character, and that it must
   be regarded as typical of the temptations by which men are commonly
   assailed. Only, there is a distinction to be drawn here. In the case of
   Jesus, the temptations addressed to Him presuppose certain peculiar
   personal qualities: the first is based upon His power of working
   miracles; the second, upon His Divine mission; the third, upon His
   destination to supremacy. Now these are no common human qualities.
   Still the first temptation can only be regarded as a common, a
   universal human temptation, if for the power to do miracles we
   substitute those God-given faculties which every man possesses, and
   which every man may either turn to purposes of selfishness and
   self-love, or use in the service of a higher life. The second
   temptation can apply more particularly, only to that smaller circle to
   whom, by reason of great mental endowments or a high position in life,
   a peculiar mission has been assigned. The third temptation also has a
   special application only to the very small number who are called to a
   position of sovereignty. And yet even these two last temptations have a
   more general application, inasmuch as the sinful inclinations of every
   man offer--though in other forms--some point assailable to their
   attack, by means of which he may be led into the sin of tempting God,
   or cherishing a lust of earthly rule. With regard to the principles put
   forth by Jesus in opposition to the tempter, it is evident that these
   are of universal application.

   We have thus, by an examination of the several temptations in detail,
   obtained a starting-point for the exposition of the narrative regarded
   as a whole. Let us, then, proceed to this latter consideration.

   [350] Pfeiffer especially refers the temptation to the kingdom of the
   Lord, and the mode of its establishment (Deutschen Zeitschrift 1851,
   No. XXII.). He makes the three temptations to be: (1) The temptation to
   satisfy the sensible wants of men, and thus to obtain authority and
   dominion among them; (2) To set up a kingdom of caprice, of lawlessness
   and licence; (3) To establish a sovereignty of merely external power.

   [351] So Rink, Deutsche Zeitschrift, 1851, No. XXXVI. p. 293. He thinks
   that the more generally the temptations are viewed, the more truly and
   deeply will the idea involved therein be manifested; and in fact he
   regards them, in the most general way possible, as the temptations of
   the lust of the flesh,' the pride of life, and the lust of the eye.'

   [352] See above, pp. 134 and 135.

   [353] While Rink insists upon receiving the temptation in this general
   manner, Laufs, on the other hand (in the Stud. und Kritik. 1853, 2, pp.
   355-386), brings forward too exclusively its Messianic aspect. Giving
   in this sense an original view of the several temptations, he finds in
   the first (the changing of stones into bread) the false Messianic
   notions which obtained among the Jews; in the second (the sway of the
   world), the false idea of a Messiah in the heathen sense, which was
   based on the expected alliance of the Messiah with, the Roman power; in
   the third (casting Himself from the temple), the notion entertained
   that the Messiah's work must begin, in spite of all dangers, at the
   temple, the theocratic centre of the nation,--and therefore in the
   midst of the scribes, Pharisees, and priestly officials,--that the
   capital being thus subjugated, the whole land might be conquered with
   one blow. This view, in spite of its ingenuity, is too far removed from
   the literal interpretation of the Gospel narrative (especially the
   answers of our Lord), and by far too artificial, to be entertained.

  CHAPTER II.

  GENERAL VIEW OF THE HISTORY OF THE TEMPTATION.

   IF commentators have been divided in their opinions concerning the
   details of this history, we shall find that they differ far more widely
   in the views which they take of the whole narrative. Here we meet with
   a graduating scale of expositions, embracing all conceivable
   diversities, from the spiritualism which regards the history as nothing
   more than a figurative mode of inculcating doctrine, to the realism
   which receives every word in its most literal acceptation. We may,
   however, make a general division of the various explanations into two
   principal classes: the first consisting of those according to which the
   whole narrative is a mere product of thought, having no basis in actual
   facts and the second, of those in which an actual historical substratum
   is recognised, which allow this passage to be the record of a real
   temptation to which Jesus was actually subjected. For the reasons
   adduced in our treatise, we take up a decided position on the latter
   side of the question. We must, however, consider somewhat particularly
   the explanations of the former class, in order, by a brief refutation
   of these, to prepare the way for that view which appears to us the true
   one.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Sec. 1. Explanations which represent the whole Narrative as a mere
   Product of Thought.

   If that portion of the Gospel history which we are now considering is
   to be regarded as nothing more than a mental creation without any
   objective historical foundation, two suppositions are conceivable with
   regard to its authorship: it may have originated with Jesus Himself, or
   it may be the production of others. In the former case it would be a
   figurative doctrinal discourse delivered by Jesus,--a parable, having
   for its object to bring vividly before the mind of His disciples
   certain principles of His kingdom, and certain fundamental maxims to
   guide them in their work of establishing that kingdom. On the latter
   supposition it is to be regarded simply as a myth,--a tradition, which
   arose from the tendency to glorify Christ as the conqueror of evil and
   the evil one. Let us test these opinions.

   The view which regards the passage as a parable, has, as is well known,
   been supported in modern times by names of no small importance. [354]
   It is however worthy of note, that the theologian who has most
   explicitly and fully defended this view, has himself seen cause to
   renounce it, and has adduced against it most important considerations.
   [355] Regarded in itself, there is nothing objectionable in the notion
   that Jesus should have prescribed to His disciples, at the beginning of
   His course, fundamental maxims for the guidance of their labours on
   behalf of the kingdom of God,--namely, that they were to work no
   miracles for their own personal advantage; that they were not to tempt
   God, or (according to another view) that they were to do nothing for
   the sake of mere ostentation; and, finally, that they were not to found
   the kingdom of God on external power and glory. [356]

   But it is difficult to see why Jesus should have chosen the form of
   parables to convey to the minds of His disciples these simple rules;
   and it is altogether inconceivable how these parables should from the
   first have been so misunderstood by the disciples, that they have come
   down to us as history, and that we cannot discover the slightest trace
   of a parabolic character about them. This narrative, as it lies before
   us at the present day, appears as an important event in the life of
   Jesus; and there can be no doubt that, in the apostolical tradition
   concerning Him, it occupied a most conspicuous,. and even an essential
   place. Everything in the story relates immediately to Jesus Himself.
   Nowhere do we find any direct reference to the apostles; and indeed it
   is difficult to see what the point of such a reference would have been.
   [357] Then, surely, if this had been a direct instruction to the
   apostles, it would have come in more appropriately in the passage
   devoted to this special subject, viz. among the rules which Jesus gave
   them to guide them in their ministry.

   Besides, the apostles themselves, when this communication was made to
   them, could not at first have avoided referring it to Jesus, and not to
   themselves. But so radical and general a misunderstanding would cast a
   reproach upon the teaching of Jesus Himself; for He must then have
   presented the thing to them in so unintelligible a way, that they took
   what He meant to be a parable for actual history. This idea is entirely
   contradicted by the whole character of His teaching on other occasions.
   The origin of such a misunderstanding could be no otherwise explained
   than by supposing that Jesus made Himself the subject of the parable;
   but this would have introduced from the very first an inappropriate and
   unintelligible element. For either the introduction of the Person of
   Jesus had, or it had not, a definite purpose. If the former,--i.e. if
   Christ therein represented Himself as the Messiah who rejected every
   false principle of conduct,--then the disciples were necessitated to
   think of some actual occurrence, some real temptation which He had
   undergone, and then the parable would pass into history. If the
   latter,--if the Person of Jesus was introduced without any definite
   purpose,--then it was manifestly unsuitable so to introduce it. For
   then the parable, being neither wholly history nor wholly allegory,
   would have produced a vague, unsatisfactory impression of something
   that was partly the one and partly the other,--would have thus been in
   fact a failure; and we cannot attribute to the greatest Master of this
   method of instruction. [358]

   The mythical interpretation comes next to the parabolic. This has, in
   modern times, been variously represented. It was first defended by
   Usteri, [359] who sought to establish it in the following way: The myth
   is a poetical production, the substance of which is a religious or
   philosophical idea clothed in a historical garb. The idea thus
   presented is something eternal, something which existed before all
   history. In the myth, history, poetry, and philosophy combine to form a
   truth, which may be merely an ideal truth, without there being any
   historical reality for it to rest upon. The deeper truth of the
   temptation consists in the idea that Christ and the devil are in
   absolute antagonism to each other, are absolutely apart from each
   other; so that although the devil may assail Christ and seek to tempt
   Him, Christ lets him have no advantage over Him, and will not yield to
   his temptations. This idea is presented to us historically as a
   threefold attempt of the devil to make Christ do evil, on the occasion
   when Christ, previous to His public appearing, had prepared
   Himself--after the example of His great models, Moses and Elias--by
   prayer and fasting for His public ministry. Thus argues Usteri.

   His view, however, involves difficulties by no means insignificant. If
   we allow a prehistoric time in the life of Jesus--though the expression
   is anything but happily chosen, when its meaning with regard to the
   heathen myths is considered--still it must be acknowledged that this
   period ended with His baptism while the temptation succeeds the
   baptism,--and this not merely by accident, but of necessity. We should
   thus be obliged to own the existence of mythical elements in the
   history of Christ's public life; and this, apart from other
   difficulties, would quite destroy the alleged distinction between
   historical and præhistorical. The Old Testament analogy, which is here
   adduced, furnishes not a trace of the mythical; for why may not Jesus,
   as well as Moses and Elias, have really retired into seclusion before
   entering upon His ministry? But the principal consideration is this: It
   is difficult, on the given explanation, to find any germ of reality in
   this myth, and to point to any satisfactory connection between
   substance and form. The idea to be clothed in a historical garb must
   surely be itself true; otherwise we have no myth, we have a mere fabric
   of the imagination. Now, what is the idea supposed to be represented
   here? It is this, that Christ and the tempter are absolutely apart from
   each other; that although the devil seeks to tempt Christ, Christ will
   not let Himself be tempted, because to be tempted in a human sense, is
   contrary to the nature of the Redeemer. But can it be believed that the
   idea of the absolute impossibility of Christ being liable to temptation
   should have been clothed in a historical form narrating an actual
   temptation? Such an idea would certainly lead us to expect an entirely
   different outward representation, e.g. that of an open assault, a
   violent onset upon} Christ on the part of Satan. Further, if the
   temptation as a fact is contrary to the idea of the Redeemer, it must
   also as a myth be contrary to that idea. If Christ could not in any
   wise be really tempted, then the idea of His temptation ought never to
   have once entered the minds of those who best knew Him. Thus, even in
   the mythical form, there would be here an error on the part of the
   apostles,--an error, too, affecting the cardinal point of the Christian
   religion, the knowledge of the Person of Christ. Finally, although we
   must say of the supposed fabricator or fabricators of the myth, that
   for them the devil existed as a real personality, this cannot be said
   of its present expositor. Hence he is found to give up another
   considerable portion of the actual myth, and there remain, from his
   standpoint, only a few meagre and incomprehensible fragments. Nay, the
   myth is as good as deprived of all meaning for a tempter who has no
   existence, and a person tempted who could not really be tempted, do
   truly furnish the strangest materials for a myth on the subject of
   temptation! As for the truth that Christ and evil were in a state of
   absolute opposition to each other, this did not need the illustration
   of a myth, both because it was self-evident, and because it could be
   much better illustrated in many other ways.

   The mythical view is presented in a more natural form by two other
   scholars, Strauss and De Wette. From the general point of view taken by
   the former, [360] he could not have done otherwise than assign a
   mythical character to this portion of the evangelical history, as well
   as the rest: besides, this passage seemed to hold out to him certain
   points, of which he was eager to avail himself, in favour of the
   correctness of mythical interpretation in general, because here several
   parallels might be brought forward from the Old Testament. According to
   Strauss, the essential purport of the myth of the temptation is to show
   that the Messiah, as the Head of all just men, and the Representative
   of the people of God, must of necessity have been tempted in like
   manner as the principal men of God in Old Testament antiquity, e.g.
   like Abraham, and like the people of God, especially during the march
   through the wilderness. De Wette, [361] while at the same time
   attending to various points of detail, expresses himself similarly with
   regard to the general import of the myth. He deduces therefrom, that
   Satan is the enemy of the Messiah and of His kingdom; and that the
   former, being subjected to the moral conflict, [362] had necessarily to
   contend with him, not only during the whole course of His agency, [363]
   and at the close of His life, [364] but also at His entrance upon His
   ministry; that as the accuser of men had proved Job, so did he prove
   the Messiah also; and that he did this at the first by the pleasures of
   the world, and at last by its terrors.'

   These expositors have this advantage over Usteri, that the temptation
   of Christ, being in their view not absolutely inadmissible as a fact,
   may naturally be allowable as an idea. Hence they far more simply make
   the purport of the myth to be, the tempting of the Messiah by Satan,
   not a conflict with Satan. Moreover, the story takes a much more
   natural form in their hands, from their method of defining the
   conception of the myth, and of applying it to the evangelic record. But
   hence arises, it must be confessed, another and a greater difficulty,
   affecting the general view of the evangelical history, especially in so
   far as that is taken up with the public and Messianic life of Jesus. If
   this be entirely mythical, with the exception of a scarcely definable
   minimum of fact, if it be even in most instances interfused with
   mythical elements, then undoubtedly the temptation is one of those
   parts which offer the least resistance to a mythical interpretation. It
   is unnecessary, however, after the elaborate discussions to which this
   mythical view of the Gospel narrative in general has been subjected, to
   show here the difficulties to which this theory is exposed, and how it
   leaves the existence, not only of the Christian Church, but even of the
   Christian faith, an utterly unexplained enigma; nay, is utterly at
   variance with these undeniable facts. If, on the contrary, we find that
   the evangelical record rests in the main, upon a historical foundation,
   the necessity then arises of establishing the historical basis also of
   the separate parts of that record, even those which are surrounded by
   most difficulties. And so long as this can be done for the narrative of
   the temptation in a satisfactory way, we, who firmly maintain the
   fundamentally historical character of the Gospel history in general,
   stall not see ourselves necessitated to have recourse, in this
   instance, to the mythical explanation.

   [356] The maxims and dispositions reproved by Christ have been
   variously stated. Hase views them quite generally, viz. as worldliness,
   covetousness, and ambition; Karsten (Mecklenb. Kirchenblatt, 1837, 1),
   as selfishness indolently craving miracles, vanity boastfully tempting
   God, and idolatrous love of the world; Theile (Theol. Lit. Bl.1841,
   Feb. No. XX.), as abuse of miraculous power, partly for selfish
   purposes, partly to excite attention, and assumption of political
   Messianic power.

   [357] De Wette, exeget. Handb. 1, 42. All the temptations, together
   with the maxims expressed by their rejection, lose their full meaning,
   unless referred to the Messiah. This applies more especially to the
   third, the offered supremacy over the world, and to its refusal, which
   cannot be applied to the apostles without doing the greatest violence
   to the narrative.

   Sec. 2.--Explanations which recognise a Historical Basis of the
   Narrative.

   The explanations according to which our narrative records an actual
   occurrence may be divided into two classes. First, there are those
   which regard the event related as something which took place inwardly
   in the soul of Jesus; and those which regard it as something external,
   as an actual transaction between the Lord Jesus and the tempter. Now,
   certain as it is, that if a real temptation took place, we shall be
   constrained to suppose also an actual agitation in the soul of Jesus;
   yet the idea of a purely internal occurrence by no means comes up to
   the meaning of the evangelists. We shall thus be necessitated to
   acknowledge that there was something really objective in the
   transaction. But before proceeding to make this more evident, we will
   briefly test the opinion that the temptation was only of a spiritual
   and internal character.

   This view appears in three different forms. The event internally
   experienced may be regarded either as a vision or as a dream, or it may
   be viewed as the sum-total of certain seductive thoughts which came
   before the mind of Jesus when in a state of perfect consciousness. Each
   of these different possibilities has been adopted; but with so little
   success, that we need not devote much space to their discussion.

   The idea of a vision or ecstasy introduces an element of fancifulness
   and extravagance entirely opposed to all that we read elsewhere of the
   clearness and self-possession which characterized the enthusiasm of
   Jesus, subjects Him to an alien and evil power, and is entirely without
   analogy in the rest of the Gospel history. Besides, this view makes the
   evil and seducing images arise from the soul of Jesus, and thus
   represents that soul itself as defiled. This applies also to the dream
   hypothesis. [365] It is true that analogies for this may easily be
   found in Bible history, though such significant dreams as may be
   adduced will be found to present an entirely different character, and
   always to be decidedly defined and limited as dreams, while in the
   present narrative there is nothing to indicate where the supposed dream
   begins and where it breaks off. Besides, a temptation in a dream is
   virtually no temptation for consciousness and self-control enter into
   the very notion of the testing and proving of any man. If the conflict
   was dreamt, so was the victory and thus the narrative loses all its
   meaning.

   Among the interpretations which belong to this category, the one which
   appears most plausible; is that which represents the whole occurrence
   as a mental one, experienced, however, neither in a state of dream or
   ecstasy, but undergone in a condition of full consciousness. According
   to this view, the whole stress must be laid upon the testing of the
   Messianic character of Jesus, and it must be supposed that He, before
   entering upon His public ministry, vividly realized the false and
   carnal idea of the Messiah which was prevalent in the world around Him
   and yet, notwithstanding the attractions it presented, both sensible
   and spiritual, entirely, rejected it, and decided upon a life of
   activity in the way appointed by God. This inward experience Jesus is
   supposed to have afterwards communicated to the disciples in the more
   intelligible form of an outward objective and personal temptation, in
   which He holds up to their view the process of thought through which He
   passed. In this form His communication forms a component part of the
   evangelistic record of Jesus as the Messiah. [366]

   In support of this view, there may be quoted from Scripture objective
   representations, whose character is, in like manner if not in equal
   degree, symbolical; and reference may be made to the fact, that inward
   experiences have always and everywhere been presented in a figurative
   form as outward facts. It must also be admitted that this explanation
   allows of a higher degree of actual temptation than do those above
   referred to. And yet it has great defects, and cannot be regarded as in
   any way exhaustive of the meaning of the text. It is not enough to
   confine the trial to the Messianic character of Jesus. We must, if the
   temptation is to be a real one, keep in view also His general human
   nature. Besides, without destroying the Gospel image of Jesus, we
   cannot concede that the temptation arose only from His own soul. It
   must have come to Him from without,--from a real, objective source.
   Thus only can the meaning of the Gospel narrative be preserved, for
   this would never have intended to symbolize, by the person of Satan,
   thoughts which arose from the soul of Jesus; and in our explanation of
   the whole, we must not do violence to this intention of the
   evangelists.

   If, then, we accept the narrative of the evangelists simply as it lies
   before us, it will appear indisputably evident that what we have to do
   with here is an external event, which, however, from its very nature,
   powerfully affected the soul of Jesus. Further, the idea of the
   evangelists is evidently that of a personal tempter acting upon Jesus
   from without, in order to seduce Him from the path which was pleasing
   to God, and especially from that way which, as Messiah, God had
   ordained for Him to walk in. Some who have acknowledged this, but who
   at the same time have disliked the idea of the tempter having been the
   devil, have endeavoured to substitute for him some human tempter, [367]
   whether an individual or a body of men, and have imagined that it was
   by a priest or a Pharisee, or by a deputation from the Sanhedrim, that
   the seductive propositions were made to Jesus. [368] But the simple
   words and meaning of Scripture preclude such an idea. Occurring without
   the article, the word diabolos might mean a tempter generally, whether
   human or otherwise, but with the article it can only be understood of
   the chief of evil spirits and the same is true of peirazon with the
   article. Besides, in the mouth of a man these temptations would be
   strange, preposterous, inadmissible, especially the demand to be
   worshipped, and the promise of dominion conjoined therewith. In a word,
   this explanation is so little in accordance with the view of antiquity
   and the spirit of Scripture, that it ought to be entirely dismissed as
   the heterogeneous production of modern opinion.

   Accordingly, nothing remains to us but to understand the tempter to be
   Satan, as the evangelists represent. And then we have the following
   alternative presented to us: either we must deny the historical
   credibility of the Gospel account, and regard the whole as a myth; or,
   admitting its trustworthiness, we must take the record as it is given
   us, and endeavour to render it intelligible. When we reflect upon the
   entire character of the Gospels and their contents, as well as upon
   those expressions which on other occasions fell from the lips of our
   Lord Himself, we have no hesitation in deciding upon the latter
   alternative, and shall accordingly, without any pretension to
   exhaustive argument, make a few remarks on this view of the subject.
   [369]

   Against the personal appearance of Satan the following objections have
   been urged--not to mention the general scruples entertained against
   admitting his existence at all, which have unmistakeably influenced
   those who have advanced them. The bodily appearance, or speaking of
   Satan, it is said, is never elsewhere mentioned in the New Testament.
   His personal appearance, even if disguised in a human form (to which
   the text makes no allusion), must at once have taken from the
   temptation all its attractions; for the Son of God must have recognised
   him at a glance. [370] Besides, if we are to take the narrative in its
   strictly literal sense, many other difficulties arise which it is by no
   means easy to set aside. If Jesus followed the devil willingly to the
   mountain and to the pinnacle of the temple, then the will of the devil
   determined His will; if against His will, then was He in the power of
   the devil, in a manner which we cannot possibly admit. Again, are not
   the temptations of too gross a nature to have been suggested by the
   subtlest of spirits? And how is the showing Him all the kingdoms of the
   world to be understood? Here at least we must depart from the literal
   interpretation; and if here, where are we to stop?

   These and similar questions might be raised in goodly number; and in
   truth they cannot all be so answered as to remove every difficulty. We
   must not forget that we have here to do with a subject about which,
   from its very nature, there must ever hang a certain amount of
   obscurity. Our general answer is as follows:--Without entering at
   present upon infer and weighty reasons whose discussion would lead us
   too far from our, more immediate object, we cannot but admit that a
   belief in a kingdom of evil spirits, and a ruler thereof, as well as of
   the influence of both upon mankind, is an important part of the
   teaching of our Lord and His apostles. This is too expressly laid down
   to allow us to suppose that the expressions of the New Testament on
   this subject are used merely in deference to contemporary notions and
   expressions, or that they are to be regarded as, in any sense of the
   word, a mere accommodation. Whoever, then, receives the doctrine not
   merely of the apostles, but especially of Jesus Himself, must receive
   this portion of it along with the rest. Now, if the existence of the
   devil and the possibility of his influence over men be admitted, the
   fact that he actually tempted our Lord also, far from presenting
   insuperable difficulties, will rather possess a peculiar significance.
   And its significance consists not merely in what has been already
   referred to,--viz. that Jesus, in conquering Satan, proved Himself
   victorious over the principle and the power of evil in general,--but
   further, in the consideration, whose full meaning is first fully
   brought out by this narrative, that it was a personal will which Jesus
   repelled and conquered.' [371] Undoubtedly there are temptations which
   come from things or from persons, without their conscious will. But
   where, as in the case before us, there is temptation in a preeminent
   degree, we shall find ourselves obliged to admit that the seductive
   influence does not proceed from an unconscious agent, but from a
   determined purpose to lead astray,--from the will of the tempter. And
   to this the evangelical narrative makes express allusion.

   Now, if we admit this, we shall have to understand the case as the
   narrative presents it to us. In other words, even though we maintain
   the historical character of the narrative, we yet distinguish very
   decidedly between a recognition of its essential reality and a literal
   interpretation of every detail. It is evident that the narrative cannot
   be taken in its strictly literal sense, as is indeed proved by the one
   fact that there is no mountain from which all the kingdoms of the world
   can be seen. There is undoubtedly somewhat of a symbolical character in
   the manner in which the facts are represented. [372] Pictures are here
   held up to the imagination,--powerfully drawn and significant
   pictures,--in order to impress upon it as strongly as possible the
   fundamental truths of the history. Hence it happens that to modern
   taste the temptations appear coarse and unskilful. That they have,
   nevertheless, a very important meaning, and are in perfect keeping with
   the circumstances in which our Lord was then placed, has, we hope, been
   sufficiently shown by our previous exposition. The visible appearance
   of Satan, and the different situations in which Jesus is presented to
   us with regard to him in the different temptations, may, however,
   partly belong to the symbolical part of the history. At least, without
   doing any violence to its substantial truth, we may easily conceive
   that the agency employed was of a more spiritual nature than the letter
   of the narrative describes, and that those mental experiences, for
   which it was impossible to find any adequate expression in words, were
   delineated in that manner in which alone they could be generally
   understood, viz. in a series of powerful and striking pictures, which
   suggest even deeper truths than they exhibit.

   [367] This opinion is supported at length in the above-cited article of
   the Tübingen Quartalschrift.

   [368] Lange has attempted a very peculiar combination in his Leben Jesu
   (Pt. i. vol. ii. § 7, p. 205), a book in which so many ingenious
   theories are advocated. On the one hand, he agrees with those who view
   the transaction as an internal temptation of Jesus, resulting from the
   national and secular spirit, especially the prevalent and false
   Messianic notions of the age. At the same time, he insists that this
   influence was brought to bear upon Him by means of certain external
   temptations. It is in the deputation of the Sanhedrim to John the
   Baptist (John i. 24) to demand an explanation of His nature and office,
   that he finds the connecting link between the external and the
   internal. This deputation, having their attention directed to Jesus by
   the Baptist, he supposes to have sought Him in the wilderness, and to
   have made the attempt of gaining Him over to their own hierarchical
   aims. Thus this hierarchy, with their seductive proposals, form only
   the prominent historical feature of the occurrence, and are the outward
   instruments of a temptation which, in its deeper source and its whole
   contrivance, we cannot but regard as satanic (see note on p. 219). This
   combination gives just prominence to the fact that the transaction must
   not be regarded as a merely external one, because if there was to be a
   real temptation, there must be an entrance of the seductive ideas into
   the soul of Jesus. But if we maintain an objective seducing power, this
   entrance of ideas must be called the subjective aspect of the
   temptation, and not be distinguished as an internal from an external
   temptation. Besides, there is no actual ground for supposing with
   Lange, that the external element was furnished by the Pharisaic
   deputation to John, for we are left without the slightest allusion to
   any intercourse between Jesus and the Pharisees in this respect; while
   if the interview in question had really taken place, it would have been
   of so far greater importance than that with the Baptist, that it could
   scarcely have been passed by unnoticed in the Gospel history. And,
   lastly, such a view of the narrative of the temptation is anything but
   in keeping with the whole tenor. of the narrative; the notion
   especially of a plurality of tempters is entirely at variance with the
   representation of the single agency of Satan.

   [369] The view of the whole as a temptation by Satan in person is
   defended by Olshausen, Biblical Commentary, vol. i. p. 169 (Clark's
   For. Theol. Lib.). His explanation, however, can scarcely be considered
   a strictly literal one, since he admits only an internal influence of
   the devil, and that only upon the soul of Christ, while His spirit
   remains unaffected thereby. The supposition that Jesus was during this
   occurrence deserted by the Divine Spirit, must be rejected as being
   contrary to Matt. iv. 1. Another advocate of the literal
   interpretation, though in a somewhat extraordinary position, is D. Paul
   Ewald (die Versuchung Christi, Bayreuth 1838), answered in the Theol.
   Lit. Blatt. Feb. 1841, No. XX. Finally, we may also mention Ebrard, in
   the Wissenschaftl. Kritik. p. 298, who maintains without further
   explanation the visible appearance of Satan; and Briggenbach (Leben
   Jesu, pp. 275, etc.), who treats this very question at greater length.
