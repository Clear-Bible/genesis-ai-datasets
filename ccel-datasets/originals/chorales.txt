  TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

   The present volume fulfils the promise which was made in the [2]Second
   Series of the Lyra Germanica, that the hymns contained there should be
   brought out in another edition, accompanied by their proper tunes. It
   constitutes, however, at the same time, an independent work, with an
   object different from that of the two preceding volumes of translations
   from the German hymnology. The Lyra Germanica was intended chiefly for
   use as a work of private devotion; the Chorale Book for England is
   intended primarily for use in united worship in the church and family,
   and in meetings for the practice of church music. This aim has
   throughout governed the choice of the hymns and tunes, and the form
   given to them; many beautiful hymns contained in the Lyra Germanica
   have thus been excluded, because their length or their purely
   reflective character rendered them ill-adapted for congregational
   singing, while a large number of new translations--about one-third of
   the whole--have been introduced, either for the sake of their tunes, or
   to supply necessary requirements of our services. These have been
   selected from various sources, chiefly from some very early German
   hymn-books, from the collections of Tucher and Wackernagel, from the
   new Bavarian hymnbook of the Lutheran Church, and from the
   Evangelisches Kirchengesangbuch, Stuttgart, 1855, published by the
   Church Conference held in Eisenach in 1853.

   With regard to the form of the hymns, considerable difficulty has
   arisen on two points;--the great length of many of them, and the
   peculiarity of their metres involving the constant use of dissyllable
   rhymes. It has seemed best, in many cases, considerably to curtail the
   longer hymns, to bring them within limits which, though they may still
   appear long to those accustomed to the English allowance of four verses
   only, may yet, it is thought, be used without inconvenience. The hymn
   may frequently be found in its complete form in the Lyra Germanica.
   This course has, however, been deemed inadmissible, where the hymn was
   very well known, or its meaning would have been seriously injured by
   abbreviation, and it has then been omitted altogether, or given at full
   length, as is the case with Luther's version of the Lord's Prayer, his
   Christmas Carol, and the fine old hymn on the Seven Words of our Lord
   on the Cross, here assigned to Good Friday.

   As a rule, the hymn and tune have been considered as one and
   indivisible, and the original metres therefore strictly preserved for
   the sake of the tunes, which would not admit of any deviation without
   detriment to their characteristic beauty. This has necessitated the
   frequent use of the double rhymes, which the structure of the German
   language renders as common, and indeed inevitable, in German, as
   monosyllabic rhymes are with us. The comparatively small number of the
   former in our language presents a serious obstacle to rendering the
   German hymns into English with the force and simplicity they possess in
   their own tongue, and without which they cannot become truly
   naturalized among us; yet it is one which must be encountered if the
   tunes also are to be introduced with them, as they ought to be, and in
   their proper form. In this work the question has been dealt with in
   detail, according to the special character of each hymn and tune; in
   some few instances, mostly of more modern date, where the tune admitted
   without injury of adaptation to single rhymes, it has been thus
   arranged; in the greater number, the versions previously given in the
   Lyra Germanica have been remodelled to suit the music. Apart from the
   rhymes, it will be observed that these hymns possess a great variety of
   metres, some of which will at first, no doubt, strike an English ear as
   strange. But it must be remembered that by far the greater part of
   these hymns and tunes date from the earlier ages of German hymnology,
   when hymns were always written to be sung, not read; for this reason
   the long and monotonous lines which mark the compositions of a later
   period and of a more didactic character, were instinctively avoided,
   and metres of more complex movement, and capable of conveying more
   variety of sentiment, were invented. These metres will be found to
   follow a strict rule of their own, both in the varying number of feet,
   and the frequent alternation of Trochaic and Iambic lines; and it is
   believed that when the ear has once learnt to perceive this, and to
   associate them with the appropriate rhythm of their tune, there is no
   reason why they should not become naturalized in England. A few,
   included here for the sake of the tunes only, may probably always
   retain an alien sound to us; but these are very few indeed, and, in
   general, it would certainly be greatly to the advantage of our
   hymn-books if we could widen the range both of form and thought which
   is now given to this class of compositions.

   At the present time, when the whole subject of church music and
   congregational singing is receiving far more attention than ever
   before, it seems peculiarly desirable to seize the opportunity to
   enrich our own hymnology from the stores of a country so pre-eminently
   distinguished in this way. That these hymns and tunes first sprang up
   on a foreign soil is no reason why they should not take root among us;
   all who use our Common Prayer know well how the unity of Christian
   sentiment is felt to swallow up all diversity of national origin. In
   truth, any embodiment of Christian experience and devotion, whether in
   the form of hymn or prayer or meditation, or whatever shape art may
   give it, if it do but go to the heart of our common faith, becomes at
   once the rightful and most precious inheritance of the whole Christian
   Church. Much more, then, where the country is so nearly akin to our
   own, may we feel that it is at once our privilege and our duty to
   appropriate all that she can bestow on us, and to hope that her gifts
   will find a welcome and a home here.

  EDITORS' PREFACE.

   In laying before the public the "Chorale Book for England," the Editors
   desire that it should be accompanied by some observations explanatory
   of its contents, and also of the principles by which they have been
   guided in its compilation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This work is based upon the translation of German hymns by Mrs C.
   Winkworth, well known under the title of "Lyra Germanica," and contains
   [1] hymns and tunes chiefly of German origin, and belonging more
   especially to the 16th and two following centuries. Had the "Chorale
   Book" however been restricted to a republication of the "Lyra
   Germanica" with music, it would not have comprised all that is
   requisite to illustrate the beauty of German Hymnology and to fit the
   work for use in the Church of England. It will be found therefore that,
   in addition to the principal contents of the "Lyra Germanica," much
   fresh matter has been brought forward.

   Though the "Chorale Book" contains hymns for all the festivals and
   services of the Church of England, the Editors have abstained, with one
   exception, [2] from inserting either hymns or tunes of English origin:
   to do so would have detracted from the special character which they
   believe the work to possess, as the first introduction into England of
   all that ranks as the essence of German Hymnology in words and music
   united.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] Whenever in this work the term hymn occurs, it is applied to the
   words as distinguished from the music.

   [2] Tune No. XCII.
     __________________________________________________________________

   During the 16th and 17th centuries Hymnology was in its height in
   Germany, and bore its most precious blossoms; hymn and tune were then
   justly considered indivisible, and, though the beauty and popularity of
   a tune would cause fresh hymns to be written for it, the tune still
   continued to be known by the name of the original hymn with which it
   was associated.

   In accordance with this precedent, the same original connection between
   hymn and tune has--with few exceptions--been maintained in this book.
   [3]

   Many hymns rightly forming part of a German hymn-book, which in a great
   measure takes the place in Germany of the Book of Common Prayer in
   England, have for obvious reasons been excluded from this compilation,
   and the Editors have thus been enabled to limit the number to two
   hundred, believing at the same time, that none have been omitted which
   are essential to the purpose in view.

   While the "Chorale Book" contains no English tunes, it nevertheless
   includes some already well known in this country, such as the "Old
   Hundredth," the "Veni Creator," that called "Luther's Hymn," [4] and
   others. The origin of every tune, as far as it can be traced, as also
   the names of the authors of the hymns, are given in the various Indexes
   at the end of the work, to which the reader is referred. It may however
   be desirable to give here a short sketch of the growth of hymnology on
   the continent, and more particularly in Germany, since the Reformation.

   When Luther took up the cause of the Reformation, and had to remodel
   the services of the Church, he believed he could not better enhance
   their beauty than by appealing to his nation's love for song, and
   fostering the practice of congregational singing (Gemeindegesang). With
   this view he made translations from the Latin hymns previously in use
   in the Church, paraphrased several of the Psalms and Canticles of Holy
   Scripture, himself wrote many new hymns, and requested his friends to
   contribute others. As to music, he availed himself in many cases of
   tunes already existing in the Church, which he sparingly modified to
   suit his new metres; of other tunes the origin is unknown, and of those
   ascribed to Luther, three only can be traced with any certainty to him
   as the composer; [5] two of which have been received into this work,
   [3]No. 124, and [4]No. VI. in the Appendix.

   The first important German hymn-book, preceded in the same year by
   several smaller books, published under the name of "Enchiridion,"
   Erfurt, &c. &c., appeared under the auspices of Luther in the year
   1524. It was edited by his friend, Johann Walther, [6] and was
   accompanied by a preface from the pen of Luther himself.

   Walther's work (printed with the music for five voices, the melody in
   the Tenor, as usual at that time), with successive additions, went
   through several editions (1537 and 1551), and was followed in rapid
   sequence by numerous similar works, of which those published at
   Wittenberg, Nürnberg, and Strasburg, are the most important. [7] Every
   new book brought fresh additions, and by the end of the 16th century
   the number of hymns introduced into the Church was counted by hundreds.
   Among the tunes of this century and the early part of the next, the
   Editors would especially name V, XIII, XXVI, XXXIX, CVI, CXVII.

   The first metrical versions of the Psalms were published in France and
   Switzerland about the same period. Among the best known, though not the
   earliest in appearance, is that edited (with the music for four voices)
   by Goudimel (1565). This work was introduced into Germany by Dr
   Lobwasser--the Psalms metrically translated by him--in 1373, and its
   contents soon found their way as a whole or in parts into the Lutheran
   Church.

   Several of Goudimel's Psalm tunes are believed to be of secular origin,
   and the same should be stated with regard to some among the finest
   tunes of the 16th century appropriated to the Lutheran service. It
   speaks well for the character of the secular music of that period, that
   any of its melodies should have taken a place in the Church, and should
   have retained it undisputed to the present day. (See XI, XL, LXXXV.)

   As another source from which the Lutheran Church gladly drew, the
   Editors must name the rich store of the early Moravian hymn-books;
   specimens from which, as well as tunes from Goudimel's edition of the
   Psalms, will be found in this work.

   About the same time Lutheran hymn-books were introduced into
   Scandinavia, where, especially in Sweden, the hymns and tunes of
   Germany, with numerous additions of home growth, have remained up to
   the present time the stock of the national hymn-book. Courland,
   Livonia, and Finland also received these sacred strains into their
   service, and still retain them, and it should be mentioned here that a
   Lutheran hymn-book was printed and published in the Icelandic language
   at Skalholt in Iceland, in the year 1594, of which a sixth edition
   appeared in 1691. [8]

   Towards the middle of the following century (the 17th) Music enters
   into a new phase. Until then its sole purpose was to serve the Church,
   through the medium of the human voice and the organ. But now
   instrumental music, though at first subordinate, begins to make its
   appearance. Secular Cantatas, forerunners of the Opera, are produced on
   festive occasions at the courts, particularly of Italy; and German
   musicians, like those of other countries, who had gone to Italy for
   study or other purposes, on their return spread the influence which
   they had themselves received.

   In Protestant Germany, Church music gradually became less an object of
   ambition to composers; fewer tunes, and most of them inferior in
   quality and vigour to those of the first century after the Reformation,
   sprung up; nor did the nation at large any longer set its seal upon
   them by adopting or rejecting them, as before. In the hymn-books of the
   latter part of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century we also find
   some of the best old tunes omitted, others deprived of the triple time
   (3/2) peculiar to them, others again without their distinct rhythm, all
   levelled to a general standard of lifeless uniformity.

   Before passing on to the last period which calls for notice in this
   place, the Editors would direct the attention of readers to the most
   prominent tune-composer of the 17th century, Johann Crüger (1598-1662),
   of whose writing many specimens will be found in this work; also to the
   tunes composed by Schein, H. Albert, and Schop, and lastly to the
   celebrated hymn and tune of G. Neumark, [10] $$"Wer nur ben lieben Gott
   ä??t waften" (No. 134).

   In the beginning of the 18th century, Freylinghausen of Halle published
   a hymn-book which soon became widely circulated. Further reference
   being made to it in another place, few words respecting it will suffice
   here. Among the numerous tunes published for the first time in that
   work, and of which the individual authors are not known, some are very
   fine, though differing in character from those of an earlier date.

   With the exception of one or two tunes most probably composed by Bach,
   one by Kühnau, one by Layriz [11] of a still more recent date, and some
   few others, which need not be specified, Freylinghausen's work in its
   several enlarged editions is the latest source from which materials for
   the "Chorale Book for England", have been drawn; nor could it be
   otherwise, as from that time sacred tunes of real worth rarely make
   their appearance; and with the diminished interest which Religion
   commanded in Germany towards the close of the 18th century, the
   distinctive outward feature of its Church, the hymn-book, also decays.
   The old standard hymns are improved, as it is termed, by recasting
   them; the tunes disappear from the hymn-books and are collected
   separately for the use of the organist, and, the control of the
   congregation having thus ceased, it is with the organist and the
   precentor alone that the responsibility for their correct performance
   rests in future. [12] If we further remember the many Principalities of
   which Germany is made up, each with sovereign authority in Church as
   well as State, and each possessing its own distinct hymn-book, we can
   hardly wonder at the unsettled and unsatisfactory state into which the
   congregational singing of Germany fell.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] In these cases the term Original Tune is used, with the quotation
   of the first line of the corresponding hymn in German above it;
   whenever the same tune appears in the book again, it is quoted with the
   first line of the English translation. In the few exceptional cases
   alluded to, the German name of the tune has been given, and the Psalms
   of Gaudimel have been quoted as they stand in his edition.

   [10] The tune became so popular, that within 100 years after its
   appearance no less than 400 hymns had been written to be sung to it.

   [11] Kühnau and Layriz have both compiled very good Chorale books.

   [12] One of the immediate consequences was the predominance of the
   organ in the service at the expense of the singing of the congregation.
   This led eventually to a practice in every respect to be deprecated,
   and which we still find all over Germany, that of introducing between
   every line of the hymn an interlude performed by the organist.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Of late years however Christian men interested in the services of the
   Church have raised their voices, trying to revive the interest of the
   Protestant part of the German nation in their congregational music, and
   urging a complete revision of the existing hymn-books. Recent
   publications, the result of these efforts, clearly show, that owing to
   the desire to see these tunes re-introduced with their exact rhythm and
   harmony as originally composed, too little allowance is made either for
   the progress of music or for the musical feelings prevalent in our own
   time. Much however had to be remedied, and these praiseworthy
   endeavours have not only already borne fruit, but will doubtless
   continue to do so.

   In this sketch, some brief mention of John Sebastian Bach, the great
   master, whose name, in the minds of all interested in the subject, is
   so closely associated with the Chorales of Germany, must necessarily
   find a place.

   While during the 17th century the strictly congregational Church music
   declined, the sacred Cantata (subsequently expanding into the Oratorio)
   arose; not only did the solemn festival of the Passion offer the
   opportunity for cultivating it, as we find from Bach's "Passionsmusik"
   the text of which, with slight modifications, was set to music by his
   predecessors and contemporaries, Keyser, Mattheson, and Handel; but the
   other festivals also recommended themselves to Bach for the exercise of
   his great powers, and Cantatas of his composition exist for nearly
   every Sunday in the year, many of which in all probability were
   performed during or after the evening service, from the Organ gallery
   of St Thomas's, Leipzic, by an orchestra and choir under his direction.

   Bach, fully alive to the beauty of the tunes and hymns of his country,
   adopted the practice, in which he was followed by his successors,
   Mendelssohn and others, of introducing Chorales into all his numerous
   sacred works, either to their own words or to new ones suiting better
   the subject of the Cantata, thereby doubtless bringing it more readily
   home to the appreciation of the congregation, well acquainted with the
   old familiar tunes.

   How Bach harmonized these Chorales is well known, and need not be dwelt
   upon here, but his introduction of them in the manner described has
   much contributed to the confusion of the titles of hymns, which has
   continued to the present time.

   After J. S. Bach's death, his son, Ph. E. Bach, undertook to extract
   the Chorales from his father's work, and to publish them in a separate
   collection. One hundred of these, edited by him, appeared in 1765. A
   second volume containing another hundred was published in 1769 (though
   not with Ph. E. Bach's name as editor). Then followed in 1784 an
   edition compiled by Kirnberger, and subsequently several others, all
   with the title, "Joh. Seb. Bach's Vierstimmige Choralgesänge."

   They are well known, and the impression generally prevails that Bach is
   the author of the tunes, which is not surprising, considering the
   manner in which these compilations, with the single exception of the
   most recent one by Erck, have been published. After what has been
   stated, this erroneous belief requires no further refutation, but it
   should be mentioned, that a few tunes, probably justly ascribed to
   Bach, and contained in the "Choralgefänge," have been inserted by the
   Editors in the "Chorale Book."

   Under the circumstances the correctness of the version of the tunes
   given in the following work must not be judged of from a comparison
   with those in Bach's works, or elsewhere in the compositions of
   Mendelssohn and other great masters. These masters could handle such
   Chorales freely for their own purposes, but the Editors were bound to
   go back to the sources, from which their melodies might be obtained not
   only most accurately, but also in the form most suitable for their
   object. They have therefore drawn either from the works in which the
   tunes originally appeared, or from those of Winterfeld, Tucher, and
   others of high standing into which they had been literally copied.

   In determining the form in which to admit these tunes, the Editors were
   naturally beset with doubts, in consequence of the unsettled state of
   hymnology in Germany at the present moment. For while one party there
   insists on retaining the tunes even more than the hymns in the state of
   lifeless uniformity into which they have fallen, the other calls for
   their complete restitution to their original form.

   Without going into detail, the Editors wish to state that they deemed
   it best to select the middle path. They have treated the tunes
   individually, not collectively; those written in 3/2 time (as, for
   example, V, LX, LXII, LXXXII, CXV, etc.) they have seen no right or
   reason to change, and in every case they have endeavoured to give the
   tune as nearly as possible according to its original version, and in a
   shape which might at the same time justify the hope of its being
   accepted by the English public. This however refers only to the
   rhythmical flow of the tune, not to the melody itself, which in no
   instance has been touched by the Editors, but is given according to the
   best-authenticated versions. [13]

   A few words have still to be said respecting the harmonization of the
   tunes in this work. The Editors have in many cases retained the
   harmonies of the authors of the tunes, and in general have striven to
   preserve as far as possible the character belonging to the period of
   their composition; thus the melodies of the 16th and 18th century
   called for different styles of harmony, clearly indicated by their
   different flow in respect of distances. In all cases, however, the
   Editors have endeavoured to combine solemnity with simplicity, and to
   give harmonies, which, though offering no difficulty in execution,
   should yet approach the strength and purity peculiar to the best Church
   music of all times.

   The Editors cannot bring this Preface to a close without pointing to
   the names of the meritorious inquirers into the interesting subject of
   Hymnology, who have of late years appeared in Germany, and without
   whose writings they believe no satisfactory hymn-book of modern times
   could be compiled; they mean G. von Tucher, P. Wackernagel, Layriz, and
   others, but particularly C. von Winterfeld, who, in his remarkable work
   on the "Evangelische Kirchengesange,"$$ [14] and other smaller
   writings, has vindicated the real importance of this sacred branch of
   music, and shown its historical basis and development in a manner at
   once to raise it in general estimation and to guide all who follow him
   in this difficult path. To his memory the grateful thanks of the
   Editors are due, and from his works, as well as from those previously
   named, they have drawn freely--as was their duty--and as seemed best
   for this work.

   That the "Chorale Book for England" may be received into the new sphere
   for which it is intended, and that its sacred strains may contribute to
   the comfort of the troubled soul, the sanctification of home, and the
   glory of God's name in His Church on earth, is the earnest prayer of
   those who compiled it.

   Allein Gott in der Höh' sei Ehr'

   [16]N. Von Hofe, 1529


   All glory be to God on High,

   Who hath our race befriended!

   To us no harm shall now come nigh,

   The feud at last is ended;

   God showeth His goodwill toward men,

   And peace shall dwell on earth again,

   Oh thank Him for His goodness.


   We praise, we worship Thee, we trust,

   And give Thee thanks for ever,

   O Father, that Thy rule is just

   And wise, and changes never:

   Thy boundless power o'er all things reigns,

   Done is whate'er Thy will ordains;

   Well for us that Thou rulest!


   O Jesu Christ, our God and Lord,

   Son of Thy heavenly Father,

   O Thou who hast our peace restored

   And the lost sheep dost gather,

   Thou Lamb of God, to Thee on high

   From out our depths we sinners cry,

   Have mercy on us, Jesus!


   O Holy Ghost, Thou precious Gift,

   Thou Comforter unfailing,

   O'er Satan's snares our souls uplift,

   And let Thy power availing

   Avert our woes and calm our dread,

   For us the Saviour's blood was shed

   We trust in Thee to save us!

   Sei Lob und Ehr dem höchsten Gut

   [18]Schutz, 1673


   All praise and thanks to God most High,

   The Father who is perfect love;

   The God who doeth wondrously,

   The God who from His throne above

   My soul with richest solace fills,

   The God who every sorrow stills;

   Give glory now to Him, our God!


   The host of heaven thy praises tell,

   All powers and thrones bow down to Thee,

   And all who in Thy shadow dwell,

   Alike in earth and air and sea,

   Declare and laud their Maker's might,

   Whose wisdom orders all things right:

   Give glory then to Him, our God!


   And for the creatures He hath made,

   Our God will ceaselessly provide,

   His grace will be their constant aid,

   And guard them round on every side;

   His kingdom ye may surely trust,

   There all is equal, all is just;

   Give glory then to Him, our God!


   I sought Him In my hour of need,

   I cried,--Lord God, now hear my prayer!

   For death He gave me life indeed,

   And hope and comfort for despair;

   For this my thanks shall endless be,

   O thank Him, thank Him too with me;

   Give glory now to Him, our God!


   The Lord is never far away,

   Is never sundered from His flock,

   He is their refuge and their stay,

   He is their peace, their trust, their rock;

   And with a mother's watchful love

   He guides them wheresoe'er they rove:

   Give glory then to Him, our God!


   Ah yes! till life hath reached its bound,

   My faithful God, I'll worship Thee!

   The chorus of Thy praise shall sound

   From henceforth over land and sea.

   Oh soul and body, now rejoice,

   My heart, send forth a gladsome voice;

   Give glory now to Him, our God!


   All ye who name Christ's holy name,

   Give all the glory to our God!

   Ye who the Father's power proclaim,

   Give all the glory to our God!

   All idols under foot be trod,

   The Lord is God, the Lord is God!

   Give glory evermore to Him!

   Himmel, Erde, Luft und Meer

   [20]J. Neander, 1679


   Lo, heaven and earth, and sea and air,

   Their Maker's glory all declare;

   And thou, my soul, awake and sing,

   To Him Thy praises also bring.


   Through Him the glorious Source of Day

   Drives all the clouds of night away;

   The pomp of stars, the moon's soft light,

   Praise Him through all the silent night.


   Behold, how He hath everywhere

   Made earth so wondrous rich and fair;

   The forest dark, the fruitful land,

   All living things do show His hand.


   Behold, how through the boundless sky

   The happy birds all swiftly fly!

   And fire and wind and storm are still

   The ready servants of His will.


   Behold the waters' ceaseless flow,

   For ever circling to and fro;

   The mighty sea, the bubbling well,

   Alike their Maker's glory tell.


   My God, how wondrously dost Thou

   Unfold Thyself to us e'en now!

   O grave it deeply on my heart

   What I am, Lord, and what Thou art!

   Auf den Nebel folgt die Sonn'

   [22]Gerhardt, 1659


   Cometh sunshine after rain,

   After mourning joy again,

   After heavy bitter grief

   Dawneth surely sweet relief!

   And my soul, who from her height

   Sank to realms of woe and night,

   Wingeth new to heav'n her flight.


   Bitter anguish have I borne,

   Keen regret my heart hath torn,

   Sorrow dimm'd my weeping eyes,

   Satan blinded me with lies;

   Yet at last am I set free,

   Help, protection, love, to me

   Once more true companions be.


   None was ever left a prey,

   None was ever turn'd away,

   Who had given himself to God,

   And on Him had cast his load.

   Who in God his hope hath placed

   Shall not life in pain outwaste,

   Fullest joy he yet shall taste.


   Though to-day may not fulfil

   All thy hopes, have patience still,

   For perchance to-morrow's sun

   Sees thy happier days begun;

   As God willeth march the hours,

   Bringing joy at last in showers,

   When whate'er we ask'd is ours.


   Now as long as here I roam,

   On this earth have house and home,

   Shall this wondrous gleam from Thee

   Shine through all my memory.

   To my God I yet will cling,

   All my life the praises sing

   That from thankful hearts outspring.


   Every sorrow, every smart,

   That the Eternal Father's heart

   Hath appointed me of yore,

   Or hath yet for me in store,

   As my life flows on, I'll take

   Calmly, gladly for His sake,

   No more faithless murmurs make.


   I will meet distress and pain,

   I will greet e'en Death's dark reign,

   I will lay me in the grave,

   With a heart still glad and brave;

   Whom the Strongest doth defend,

   Whom the Highest counts His friend,

   Cannot perish in the end.

   O dass ich tausend Zungen hätte

   [24]J. Mentzer, 1704


   Oh would, my God, that I could praise Thee

   With thousand tongues, by day and night!

   How many a song my lips should raise Thee,

   Who order'st all things here aright.

   My thankful heart would ever be

   Telling what God hath done for me.


   O all ye powers that He implanted,

   Arise, keep silence thus no more,

   Put forth the strength that He hath granted,

   Your noblest work is to adore;

   O soul and body, make ye meet

   With heartfelt praise your Lord to greet.


   Ye forest leaves so green and tender,

   That dance for joy in summer air;

   Ye meadow grasses bright and slender,

   Ye flowers, so wondrous sweet and fair;

   Ye live to thow His praise alone,

   Help me to make His glory known.


   O all things that have breath and motion,

   That throng with life earth, sea, and sky,

   Now join me in my heart's devotion,

   Help me to raise His praises high,

   My utmost powers can ne'er aright

   Declare the wonders of His might.


   But I will tell, while I am living,

   His goodness forth with every breath,

   And greet each morning with thanksgiving,

   Until my heart is still in death,

   Nay, when at last my lips grow cold,

   His praise shall in my sighs be told.


   O Father, deign Thou, I beseech Thee,

   To listen to my earthly lays;

   A nobler strain in heaven shall reach Thee,

   When I with angels hymn Thy praise,

   And learn amid their choirs to sing

   Loud hallelujahs to my King.

   Lob sei Dir, treuer Gott und Vater

   [26]Mentzer, 1704


   I praise Thee, O my God and Father,

   For all I am and all I have,

   The blessings that we daily gather,

   Ev'n from our cradle to our grave;

   For Thy rich grace hath scatter'd here

   Whate'er we need to help and cheer.


   I praise Thee, Saviour, whose compassion

   Hath brought Thee down to succour me;

   Thy pitying heart sought my salvation,

   Though keenest woes were heaped on Thee,

   Wrought me from bondage full release,

   Made me Thine own, and gave me peace.


   Thee too I praise, O Holy Spirit,

   By whose deep teachings I am made

   A heavenly kingdom to inherit,

   Who art my Comforter, my aid;

   Whate'er of good by me is done

   Is of Thy grace and light alone.


   And as my life is onward gliding,

   With each fresh scene anew I mark

   How Thou art holding me and guiding,

   Where all seems troubled, strange, and dark;

   When cares oppress and hopes depart,

   Thy light hath never failed my heart.


   Shall I not then be filled with gladness,

   Shall I not praise Thee evermore?

   And triumph o'er all fears and sadness,

   E'en when my cup of woe runs o'er?

   Though heaven and earth may pass away,

   I know Thy word stands fast for aye.

   Sheet Music

   7.8.7.8.7.6.7.6.7.6.7.6

   Nun lob' mein Seel' den Herren

   [28]Gramann, 1540


   My soul, now praise thy Maker!

   Let all within me bless His name,

   Who maketh thee partaker

   Of mercies more than thou dar'st claim!

   Forget him not, whose meekness

   Still bears with all thy sin,

   Who healeth all thy weakness,

   Renews thy life within,

   Whose grace and care are endless,

   And sav'd thee thro' the past;

   Who leaves no suff'rer friendless,

   But rights the wrong'd at last!


   He shows to man His treasure

   Of judgment, truth, and righteousness,

   His love beyond our measure,

   His yearning pity o'er distress;

   Nor treats us as we merit,

   But lays His anger by,

   The humble contrite spirit

   Finds His compassions nigh;

   And high as heaven above us,

   As break from close of day,

   So far, since He doth love us,

   He puts our sins away.


   For as a tender father

   Hath pity on his children here,

   He in His arms will gather

   All who are His in childlike fear;

   He knows how frail our powers,

   Who but from dust are made,

   We flourish as the flowers,

   And even so we fade,

   A storm-wind o'er them passes,

   And all their bloom is o'er,--

   We wither like the grasses,

   Our place knows us no more.


   His grace alone endureth,

   And children's children yet shall prove

   How God with strength assureth

   The hearts of all that seek His love.

   In heaven is fixed His dwelling,

   His rule is over all,

   Angels in might excelling,

   Bright hosts, before Him fall!

   Praise Him who ever reigneth,

   All ye who hear His word;

   Nor our poor hymns disdaineth,--

   My soul, O praise the Lord!

   Meine Hoffnung stehet feste

   [30]Neander, 1679


   All my hope is grounded surely

   On the ever-living God,

   I can trust His aid securely,

   He shall be my highest Good;

   For this Rock fears no shock,

   And our trust will never mock.


   Tell me, if no dread e'er seizes

   You, who lean on some frail man?

   Can you build on waves and breezes?

   Dare you trust your wisest plan?

   Soon 'tis past, cannot last,

   Nought that earth has standeth fast.


   But His goodners still shall flourish

   Evermore, nought changes here;

   Man and beast His hand doth nourish

   Day by day through all the year;

   Morn and eve, doth He give

   All they need to all that live.


   Are we not by gifts surrounded

   More than we dare ask of good?

   For His mercies are unbounded,

   Flowing like a mighty flood;

   Earth and air to us bear

   Tokens of His loving care.


   Let not then His gifts upbraid us,

   Who His very Son hath given;

   Thank, O thank Him who hath made us

   From the dust, yet heirs of heaven.

   God is our shield and tower,

   Great in wisdom, love, and power.

   Sollt' ich meinem Gott nicht singen

   [34]Gerhardt, 1659


   Shall I not sing praise to Thee,

   Shall I not give thanks, O Lord?

   Since for us in all I see

   How Thou keepest watch and ward;

   How the truest, tend'rest love

   Ever fills Thy heart, my God,

   Helping, cheering, on their road

   All who in Thy service move.

   All things else have but their day,

   God's love only lasts for aye.


   As the eagle o'er her nest

   Spreads her sheltering wings abroad,

   So from all that would molest

   Doth Thine arm defend me, Lord;

   From my youth up e'en till now

   Of the being Thou did'st give,

   And the earthly life I live,

   Faithful Guardian still wert Thou.

   All things else have but their day,

   God's love only lasts for aye.


   When I sleep my Guardian wakes,

   And revives my wearied mind;

   Every morning on me breaks

   With some mark of love most kind;

   Had my God not stood my Friend,

   Had His countenance not been

   Here my guide, I had not seen

   Many a trial reach its end.

   All things else have but their day,

   God's love only lasts for aye.


   As a father ne'er withdraws

   From a child his all of love,

   Though it often break his laws,

   Though it careless, wilful, prove:

   Even so my loving Lord

   Doth my faults with pity see;

   With His rod He chastens me,

   Not avenging with His sword.

   All things else have but their day,

   God's love only lasts for aye.


   When His strokes upon me light,

   Bitterly I feel their smart,

   Yet are they, if seen aright,

   Tokens that my Father's heart

   Yearns to bring me back again

   Through these crosses to His fold,

   From the world that fain would hold

   Soul and body in its chain.

   All things else have but their day,

   God's love only lasts for aye.


   All my life I still have found,

   And I will forget it never,

   Every sorrow hath its bound,

   And no cross endures for ever.

   After all the winter's snows

   Comes sweet summer back again;

   Patient souls ne'er wait in vain,

   Joy is given for all their woes.

   All things else have but their day,

   God's love only lasts for aye.


   Since then neither change nor end

   In Thy love can e'er have place,

   Father! I beseech Thee send

   Unto me Thy loving grace.

   Help Thy feeble child, and give

   Strength to serve Thee day and night,

   Loving Thee with all my might,

   While on earth I yet must live;

   So shall I, when Time is o'er,

   Praise and love Thee evermore.

   In soul and body shield us well,

   And guard us with His sleepless might

   From every ill by day and night!


   The Lord, the Saviour, Light Divine,

   Now cause His face on us to shine,

   That seeing Him, with perfect faith

   We sruft His love for life and death!


   The Lord, the Comforter, be near,

   Imprint His image deeply here,

   From bonds of sin and dread release,

   And give us His unchanging peace!


   O Triune God! Thou vast abyss!

   Thou ever-flowing Fount of bliss,

   Brighten Thou my Sabbath morning,

   With Thy joyous sunshine blest

   Happy is my day of rest!

   And with grace and mercy feed me;

   Rich in fruits that Thou dest love.


   Kindle Thou the sacrifice

   That upon my lips is lying;

   Clear the shadows from mine eyes,

   That, from every error flying,

   No strange fire may in me glow

   That Thine altar doth not know.


   Let me with my heart to-day,

   Holy, Holy, Holy, singing,

   Rapt awhile from earth away,

   All my soul to Thee upspringing,

   Have a foretaste inly given

   How they worship Thee in Heaven.


   Rest in me and I in Thee,

   Build a Paradise within me;

   Oh reveal Thyself to me;

   Blessed Love, who diedst to win me;

   Fed from Thine exhaustless urn,

   Pure and bright my lamp shall burn.


   Hence all care, all vanity,

   For the day to God is holy;

   Come, Thou glorious Majesty,

   Deign to fill this temple lowly;

   Nought to-day my soul shall move,

   Simply resting in Thy love.

   Thy grace and help through Christ Thy Son,

   [74]Gerhardt, 1653


   Ah! Lord, how shall I meet Thee,

   How welcome Thee aright?

   All nations long to greet Thee,

   My hope, my sole delight!

   Brighten the lamp that burneth

   But dimly in my breast,

   And teach my soul, that yearneth

   To honour such high guest.


   Thy Zion strews before Thce

   Her fairest buds and palms,

   And I too will adore Thee

   With sweetest songs and psalms;

   My soul breaks forth in flowers

   Rejoicing in Thy fame,

   And summons all her powers

   To honour Jesus' name.


   Nought, nought, dear Lord, could move Thee

   To leave Thy rightful place

   Save love, for which I love Thee;

   A love that could embrace

   A world where sorrow dwelleth,

   Which sin and suffering fill,

   More than the tongue e'er telleth;--

   Yet Thou couldst love it still!


   O ye sad hearts that sicken

   With hope deferred, and see

   The gloom around you thicken,

   The joys ye hoped for flee,--

   Despair not, He is near you,

   Yea, at the very door,

   Who best can help and cheer you,

   He will not linger more.


   Nor sin shall make you fearful,

   Ashamed to see His face,

   The contrite heart and tearful

   He covers with His grace;

   He comes to heal the spirit

   That mourneth sin-oppressed,

   And raise us to inherit

   With Him our proper rest.


   He comes to judge the nations,

   A terror to His foes,

   A light of consolations

   And blessed hope to those

   Who love the Lord's appearing:

   O glorious Sun, now come,

   Send forth Thy beams of cheering

   And guide us safely home!

   Thyself made poor and weak;

   O love beyond compare that thus

   Can foes and sinners seek!

   We raise on high a gladsome voice,

   And evermore with thanks rejoice

   Came in likeness lowly,

   Son of God most holy,

   Bore the cross to save us,

   Hope and freedom gave us.


   Still He comes within us,

   Still His voice would win us

   From the sins that hurt us;

   Would to Truth convert us

   From our foolish errors,

   Ere He comes in terrors.


   Thus if thou hast known Him,

   Not ashamed to own Him,

   Nor dost love Him coldly,

   But wilt trust Him boldly,

   He will now receive thee,

   Heal thee, and forgive thee.


   But through many a trial,

   Deepest self-denial,

   Long and brave endurance,

   Must thou win assurance

   That His own He makes thee,

   And no more forsakes thee.


   He who thus endureth

   Bright reward secureth;

   Come then, O Lord Jesus,

   From our sins release us.

   Time never more shall sweep away thy doom.

   Know what the Lord Himself hath spoken

   Shall come at last and not delay:

   No human wisdom fathoms depths like these:

   O flee earth's base delights and pride,

   For as the bird is in the snare,

   Or ever of its foe aware,

   So comes that day so long denied.


   Yet He in love delayeth long

   That awful day, and grants the sinner space

   To turn away from sin and wrong,

   And mourning seek in time His love and grace.

   He holdeth back that best of days

   Until the righteous shall approve

   Their faith and hope, their constant love;

   So gentle us-ward are His ways!


   And those found faithful then shall see

   A dread hath come on me,

   I know not where to flee,

   My pow'rs can nought avail me;

   My trembling limbs grow weak,

   My lips refuse to speak,

   My heart and senses fail me:


   For thinking on that sound

   That once shall pierce the ground

   And make its slumb'rers tremble,--

   "Arise! the Day of Doom

   Is come at last,--is come!

   Before the judge assemble!


   Ah God! no tempest's shock

   That cleaves the solid rock

   Could make my spirit shiver

   As doth that awful tone;

   Were my heart steel or stone

   'T would hear that voice and quiver.


   I eat, or wake, or sleep,

   I talk, or smile, or weep,

   Yet still that voice of thunder

   Is sounding through my heart,--

   "Forget not what thou art,

   The doom thou liest under!


   For daily do I see

   How many deaths there be,

   How swiftly all things wither;

   How sickness fills the grave,

   Or fire, or sword, or wave

   Is sweeping thousands thither.


   My turn will soon be here,

   The end is drawing near,

   I hear its warning plainly;

   Death knocketh at my door

   And tells me all is o'er,

   And I would fly him vainly.


   Ah! who in this my strait

   Will be mine Advocate?

   Will all things leave me friendless?

   My wealth and power are dust,

   This Judge is ever just,

   His righteous doom is endless.


   Lord Jesus Christ! 't is Thou

   Alone canst help me now,

   But 't was for this Thou camest,

   To save us in this hour;--

   Then show Thy mercy's power,

   For they are safe Thou claimest.


   Speak Thou for me! Thou art

   The refuge of my heart;

   With gladness let me hear Thee;

   Bid me to Thee ascend,

   Where praise shall never end,

   And love shall aye be near Thee.

   [100]Luther, 1538


   From heaven above to earth I come

   To hear good news to ev'ry home;

   Glad tidings of great joy I bring,

   Whereov I now will say and sing:


   To you this night in born a child

   of Mary, chosen mother mild;

   This little child, of lowly birth,

   Shall be the joy of all your earth.


   'Tis Christ, our God, who far on high

   Hath heard your sad and bitter cry

   Himself will your Salvation be,

   Himself from sin will make you free.


   He brings those blessings, long ago

   Prepared by God for all below;

   Henceforth His kingdom open stands

   To you, as to the angel bands.


   There are the tokens ye shall mark,

   The swaddling clothes and manger dark;

   There shall ye find the young child laid,

   By whom the heavens and earth were made.


   Now let us all with gladsome cheer

   Follow the shepherds, and draw near

   To see this wondrous gift of God,

   Who hath His only Son bestow'd.


   Give heed, my heart, lift up thine eyes!

   Who is it in yon manger lies?

   Who is this child, so young and fair?

   The blessed Christ-child lieth there.


   Welcome to earth, Thou noble guest,

   Through whom e'en wicked men are blest!

   Thou com'st to share our misery,

   What can we render, Lord, to Thee!


   Ah Lord, who hast created all,

   How hast Thou made Thee weak and small,

   That Thou must choose Thy infant bed

   Where ass and ox but lately fed!


   Were earth a thousand times as fair,

   Beset with gold and jewels rare,

   She yet were far too poor to be

   A narrow cradle, Lord, for Thee.


   For velvets soft and silken stuff

   Thou hast but hay and straw so rough,

   Whereon Thou King, so rich and great,

   As 'twere Thy heaven, art throned in state.


   Thus hath it pleased Thee to make plain

   The truth to us poor fools and vain,

   That this world's honour, wealth, and might

   Are nought and worthless in Thy fight.


   Ah! dearest Jesus, Holy Child,

   Make Thee a bed, soft, undefiled,

   Within my heart, that it may be

   A quiet chamber kept for Thee.


   My heart for very joy doth leap,

   My lips no more can silence keep;

   I too must raise with joyful tongue

   That sweetest ancient cradle-song--


   Glory to God in highest heaven,

   Who unto man His Son hath given!

   While angels sing with pious mirth

   A glad New Year to all the earth.

   O wondrous joy, that God most high

   A virgin mild hath borne this Child,

   Such grace and glory God hath put upon her.


   Sin brought us grief, but Christ relief,

   When down to earth He came for our salvation;

   Since God with us is dwelling thus,

   Who dares to speak the Christian's condemnation?


   Then hither throng, with happy song

   With all Thy saints, Thee, Lord, we sing,

   Praise, honour, thanks to Thee we bring,

   That Thou, O long-expected guest,

   Hast come at last to make us blest!

   How many a heart hath long'd for Thee;

   Long years our fathers hoped of old

   Their eyes might yet Thy Light behold:

   The prophets cried; "Ah, would He came

   To break the fetters of our shame:

   That help from Zion came to men,

   Israel were glad, and prosper'd then!"

   Now art Thou here; we know Thee now,

   In lowly manger lieth Thou;

   A child, yet makest all things great,

   From Thee alone all gladness flows,

   Who yet shalt bear such bitter woes

   Earth's light and comfort Thou shalt be,

   Yet none shall watch to comfort Thee.

   All heavens are Thine, yet Thou dost come

   To sojourn in a stranger's home;

   Thou hangest on Thy mother's breast

   Who art the joy of spirits blest.

   Now fearless I can look on Thee,

   From sin and grief Thou sett'st me free;

   Thou bearest wrath, Thou conquerest Death,

   Fear turns to joy Thy glance beneath.

   Thou art my Head, my Lord Divine,

   I am Thy member, wholly Thine,

   And in Thy Spirit's strength would still

   Ah, how blindly did we stray,

   Hath arisen with beams unclouded,

   And we aee before it fly

   All the heavy gloom that shrouded

   This sad earth, where sin and woe

   Seem'd to reign o'er all below.


   Thy appearing, Lord, shall fill

   All my thoughts in sorrow's hour;

   Thy appearing, Lord, shall still

   All my dread of death's dark power;

   Whether joy or tears be mine,

   Through them still Thy light shall shine.


   Let me, when my course is run,

   Calmly leave a world of sadness

   For the place that needs no sun,

   For Thou art its light and gladness,

   For the mansions fair and bright,

   Where Thy saints are crown'd with light.

   Soon that likeness shall appear

   Which the heart had lost through sin,

   God's own image fair and clear,

   And the soul serene and bright

   Mirrors back His heavenly light.

   But that Thou shouldst dwell in me

   Let this only fill my thought,

   How I may grow liker Thee,

   Through this earthly care and strife,

   Through the calm eternal life.

   O Love, who lovest me for aye,

   Who for my soul dost ever plead;

   O Love, who didst my ransom pay,

   Whore power sufficeth in my stead;

   O Love, I give myself to Thee,

   Thine ever, only Thine to be.


   O Love, who once shalt bid me rise

   From out this dying life of ours;

   O Love, who once above yon skies

   Shalt set me in the fadeless bowers:

   O Love, I give myself to Thee,

   Thine ever, only Thine to be.

   Wenn meine Sünd' mich kränken

   [152]Gesenius, 1646


   When o'er my sins I sorrow,

   Lord, I will look to Thee,

   And hence my comfort borrow,

   That Thou wast slain for me!

   Yea, Lord, Thy precious blood was spilt

   For me, O most unworthy,

   To take away my guilt.


   Then let Thy woes, Thy patience,

   My heart with strength inspire

   To vanquish all temptations,

   And spurn all low desire;

   This thought I fain would cherish most--

   What pain my soul's redemption

   To Thee, O Saviour, cost!


   Whate'er may be the burden,

   The cross here on me laid;

   Be shame or want my guerdon,

   I'll bear it with Thine aid;

   Give patience, give me strength to take

   Thee for my bright example,

   And all the world forsake.


   And let me do to others

   As Thou hast done to me,

   Love all men as my brothers,

   And serve them willingly,

   With ready heart, nor seek my own,

   But as Thou, Lord, hast help'd us,

   From purest love alone.


   And let Thy cross upbear me

   With strength, when I depart;

   Tell me that nought can tear me

   From my Redeemer's heart,

   But since my trust is in Thy grace

   Thou wilt accept me yonder,

   Where I shall see Thy face!

   Jesu, meines Lebens Leben

   [154]Homburg, 1659


   Christ the Life of all the living,

   Christ the Death of death our foe,

   Who Thyself for us once giving

   To the darkest depths of woe,

   Patiently didst yield Thy breath

   But to save my soul from death;

   Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,

   Blessed Jesus, brought to Thee.


   Thou, ah Thou, hast taken on Thee

   Bitter strokes, a cruel rod,

   Pain and scorn were heap'd upon Thee

   O Thou sinless Son of God,

   Only thus for me to win

   Rescue from the bonds of sin;

   Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,

   Blessed Jesus, brought to Thee.


   Thou didst bear the smiting only

   That it might not fall on me;

   Stoodest falsely charged and lonely,

   That I might be safe and free;

   Comfortless that I might know

   Comfort from Thy boundless woe;

   Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,

   Blessed Jesus, brought to Thee.


   That Thou wast so meek and stainless

   Doth atone for my proud mood;

   And Thy death makes dying painless,

   All Thy ills have wrought our good;

   Yea, the shame Thou didst endure

   Is my honour and my cure;

   Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,

   Blessed Jesus, brought to Thee.


   Then for all that wrought our pardon,

   For Thy sorrows deep and sore,

   For Thine anguish in the garden,

   I will thank Thee evermore;

   Thank Thee with my latest breath

   For Thy sad and cruel death,

   For that last most bitter cry,

   And shall praise Thee, Lord, on high.

   Ah wounded Head that bearest

   Such bitter shame and scorn,

   That now so meekly wearest

   The mocking crown of thorn!

   Erst reigning in the highest

   In light and majesty,

   Dishonour'd here Thou diest,

   Yet here I worship Thee.


   Thou noble Face, whose anger

   Shall make a world to quail,

   That glance is quench'd in languor

   To which the sun were pale;

   How hath its brightness vanish'd!

   Those gracious eyes how dim!

   What foe their light hath banish'd,

   Who dared to scoff at Him?


   All lovely hues have faded

   That glow'd with warmth and life

   As He endures unaided

   The last and mortal strife;

   The Mighty One of valour

   Must yield Him as a prey,

   Death triumphs in his pallour

   O'er all His strength to-day.


   Ah Lord, this cruel burden

   Of right belongs to me;

   Of my misdeeds the guerdon

   Hath all been laid on Thee;

   I cast me down before Thee,

   Wrath were my rightful lot,

   Yet hear me, I implore Thee,

   Redeemer, spurn me not!


   My Guardian, deign to own me,

   My Shepherd, I am Thine;

   What goodness hast Thou shewn me,

   O Fount of Love Divine!

   How oft Thy lips have fed me

   On earth with angels' food!

   How oft Thy Spirit led me

   To stores of heavenly good!


   Ah would that I were bidden

   To share Thy cross and woes!

   There all true joy lies hidden,

   Thence all true comfort flows.

   Ah well for me, if lying

   Here at Thy feet, my Life,

   I too with Thee were dying,

   And thus might end my strife!


   My soul doth melt within me,

   O Jesus, dearest Friend,

   That Thou shiouldst bear to win me

   Such woes, for such an end!

   Ah make me cling the firmer

   To One so true to me,

   And sink without a murmur

   To sleep at last in Thee.


   Yes, when I hence betake me,

   Lord, do not Thou depart;

   Oh I never more forsake me

   When death is at my heart,

   And faith and hope are sinking,

   O'erwhelm'd with dread dismay;

   Thou barest all unshrinking,--

   Oh chase my fears away!


   Appear then, my Defender,

   My Comfort, ere I die!

   This life I can surrender

   If but I see Thee nigh;

   My dim eyes shall behold Thee,

   Upon Thy cross thall dwell,

   My heart by faith enfold Thee

   Who dieth thus, dies well!

   Herzliebster Jesu, was hast Du verbrochen

   [162]J. Heerman, 1630


   Alas, dear Lord, what law then hast Thou broken,

   That suck sharp sentence should on The be spoken?

   Of what great crime hast Thou to make confession--

   What dark transgression?


   They crown His head with thorns, they smite, they scourge Him,

   With cruel mockings to the cross they urge Him,

   They give Him gall to drink, they still decry Him,--

   They crucify Him.


   Whence come these sorrows, whence this mortal anguish

   It is my sins for which my Lord must languish;

   Yes, all the wrath, the woe He doth inherit,

   'T is I do merit!


   What strangest punishmnent is suffer'd yonder!--

   The Shepherd dies for sheep that loved to wander!

   The Master pays the debts His servants owe Him,

   Who would not know Him.


   There was no spot in me by sin untainted,

   Sick with its venom all my heart had fainted;

   My heavy guilt to hell had well-nigh brought me,

   Such woe it wrought me.


   O wondrous love! whose depths no heart hath sounded,

   That brought Thee here by foes and thieves surrounded;

   All worldly pleasures, heedless, I was trying,

   While Thou wert dying!


   O mighty King! no time can dim Thy glory!

   How shall I spread abroad Thy wondrous story?

   How shall I find some worthy gift to proffer?

   What dare we offer?


   For vainly doth our human wisdom ponder--

   Thy woes, Thy mercy still transcend our wonder.

   Oh how should I do aught that could delight Thee!

   Can I requite Thee?


   Yet unrequited, Lord, I would not leave Thee,

   I can renounce whate'er doth vex or grieve Thee,

   And quench with thoughts of Thee and prayers most lowly,

   All fires unholy.


   But since my strength alone will ne'er suffice me

   To crucify desires that still entice me,

   To all good deeds, oh let Thy Spirit win me,

   And reign within me!


   I'll think upon Thy mercy hour by hour,

   I'll love Thee so that earth must lose her power;

   To do Thy will shall be my foic endeavour

   Henceforth for ever.


   Whate'er of earthly good this life may grant me

   I'll rlsk for Thee,--no shame, no cross shall daunt me;

   I shall not fear what man can do to harm me,

   Nor death alarm me.


   But worthless is my sacrifice, I own it,

   Yet, Lord, for love's sake Thou wilt not disown it;

   Thou wilt accept my gift in Thy great meekness,

   Nor shame my weakness.


   And when, dear Lord, before Thy throne in heaven

   To me the crown of joy at last is given,

   Where sweetest hymns Thy saints for ever raise Thee,

   I too shall praise Thee!

   Da Jesus an dem Kreuze stund

   [164]Ancient


   When on the cross the Saviour hung,

   And that sore load that on Him weigh'd

   With bitter pangs his nature wrung,

   Seven words amid His pain He said:

   Oh let them well to heart be laid!


   "Father, forgive these men;" He spake;

   "For lo! they know not what they do,

   Nor of my sufferings vengeance take!"

   And when we sin in error too,

   For us, dear Lord, this prayer renew!


   He thought upon the thief, and said,--

   "Thou shalt behold my Paradise

   With me, ere yet this day be fled."

   Lord, see us too with pitying eyes,

   And raise us from our miseries!


   His mother stood beside Him there;

   "Behold thy son! Oh let her find

   A son, O John, in thy true care,"

   Lord, care for those we leave behind,

   Nor let the world prove all unkind!


   Once more He saith,--"I thirst, I thirst!"

   O Prince of Life! that we might be

   Rescued from death, Thou dar'st the worst.

   So dost Thou long to set us free!

   Not fruitless be that thirst in Thee!


   Again, "My God, My God," He cried,

   Ah why dost Thou forsake me thus?"

   Thou art forsaken at this tide,

   To win acceptance, Lord, for us;

   Oh comfort deep and marvellous!


   He saith,--"Lo! it is finish'd now!"

   Saviour, Thy perfect work is done!

   O make us faithful, Lord, as Thou,

   No trial and no cross to shun

   Till all Thou lay'st on us be done.


   And last,--"My Father, to Thine hands

   My parting soul I now commend."

   Lord, when my spirit trembling stands

   Upon life's verge, this cry I send

   To Thee, and with Thy words I end.


   Whoso shall ponder oft these words

   When long-past sins his soul alarm,

   Shall find the hope Thy cross accords,

   And in Thy grace a healing balm

   That brings the wounded conscience calm.


   Lord Jesu Christ, who diedst for us,

   This one thing grant us evermore;

   To ponder o'er Thy passion thus,

   Till truer, deeper than before

   We learn to love Thee and adore!

   [185]Louisa Henrietta of Brandenburgh, 1653


   Jesus Christ, my sure Defence

   And my Saviour, ever liveth;

   Knowing this, my confidence

   Rests upon the hope it giveth,

   Though the night of death be fraught

   Still with many an anxious thought.


   Jesus, my Redeemer, lives!

   I too unto life must waken;

   He will have me where He is,

   Shall my courage then be shaken?

   Shall I fear? Or could the Head

   Rise and leave its members dead?


   Nay, too closely am I bound

   Unto Him by hope for ever;

   Faith's strong hand the Rock hath found,

   Grasped it, and will leave it never;

   Not the ban of death can part

   From its Lord the trusting heart.


   What now sickens, mourns, and sighs,

   Christ with Him in glory bringeth;

   Earthly is the seed and dies,

   Heavenly from the grave it springeth;

   Natural is the death we die,

   Spiritual our life on high.


   Then take comfort, nay, rejoice,

   For His members Christ will cherish;

   Fear not, they will know His voice,

   Though awhile they seem to perish,

   When the final trump is heard,

   And the deaf, cold grave is stirred.


   Laugh to scorn the gloomy grave,

   And at death no longer tremble,

   For the Lord, who comes to save,

   Round Him shall His saints assemble,

   Raising them o'er all their foes,

   Mortal weakness, fear, and woes.


   Only draw away your heart

   Now from pleasures base and hollow;

   Would ye there with Christ have part,

   Here His footsteps ye must follow;

   Fix your heart beyond the skies,

   Whither ye yourselves would rise!

   But now the Lord is risen to-day,

   And brings us life from heaven;

   Wherefore let us all rejoice

   And praise our God with cheerful voice,

   And sing loud Hallelujahs.--Hallelujah!


   No son of man could conquer Death,

   Such mischief sin had wrought us,

   For innocence dwelt not on earth,

   And therefore Death had brought us

   Into thraldom from of old,

   And ever grew more strong and bold,

   His shadow lay athwart us.--Hallelujah!


   But Jesus Christ, God's only Son,

   Hath come to conquer for us,

   Hath put away our sins, and won

   Death's power and title o'er us.

   Now 'tis but his form is left,

   For of his sting he is bereft

   Since Jesus will restore us.--Hallelujah!


   It was a wondrous war, I trow,

   When Life and Death contended;

   But Life hath triumphed o'er the foe,

   The reign of Death is ended;

   Yea, 'tis as the Scripture saith,

   That Christ in dying conquered Death,

   And from his realm ascended.--Hallelujah!


   Then let us keep the feast to-day

   That God Himself hath given;

   And His pure Word shall do away

   The old and evil leaven;

   Christ to-day will meet His own,

   And faith will feed on Him alone,

   And my heart with rapture beat,

   Now Thy glory is display'd,

   Thine ere yet the worlds were made?


   As I watch Thee far ascending

   To the right hand of the throne,

   See the host before Thee bending,

   Praising Thee in sweetest tone,

   Shall not I too at Thy feet

   Here the angels' strain repeat,

   And rejoice that heaven doth ring

   With the triumph of my King?


   Power and Spirit are o'erflowing,

   On me also be they pour'd;

   Every hindrance overthrowing,

   Make Thy foes Thy footstool, Lord!

   Yea, let earth's remotest end

   To Thy righteous sceptre bend,

   Make Thy way before Thee plain,

   O*er all hearts and spirits reign.


   Lo! Thy presence now is filling

   All Thy Church in every place;

   Fill my heart too, make me willing

   In this season of Thy grace;

   Come, Thou King of glory, come,

   Deign to make my heart Thy home,

   There abide and rule alone,

   As upon Thy heavenly throne!


   Thou art leaving me, yet bringing

   God and heaven most inly near;

   From this earthly life upspringing,

   As though still I saw Thee here,

   Let my heart, transplanted hence,

   Strange to earth and time and sense,

   Dwell with Thee in heaven e'en now,

   Where our only joy art Thou!

   Auf Christ Himmelfahrt allein

   [201]Wegelin, 1636


   Since Christ has gone to heav'n His home,

   I too that home one day must share;

   And in this hope I overcome

   All doubt, all anguish, and despair;

   For where the Head is, well we know,

   The members he hath left below

   In time He surely gathers there.


   Since Christ hath reached His glorious throne,

   And mighty gifts henceforth are His,

   My heart can rest in heaven alone,

   On earth my Lord I daily miss;

   I long to be with Him on high,

   And heart and thoughts would hourly fly

   Where now my only treasure is.


   From Thy ascension let such grace,

   Dear Lord, be ever found in me,

   That steadfast faith may guide my ways

   With step unfault'ring up to Thee,

   And at Thy voice I may depart

   With joy to dwell where Thou, Lord, art:

   O Saviour, grant this prayer to me!

   Heavenward doth our journey tend,

   Here on earth we are but strangers,

   Towards our Promised Land we wend,

   Through a wilderness of dangers;

   Here we roam, a pilgrim band,

   Yonder is our native land.


   Heavenward stretch, my soul, thy wings,

   Thou canst claim a heavenly nature;

   Cleave not to these earthly things,

   Thou canst rest not in the creature.

   Every soul that God inspires,

   Back to Him, its Source, aspires.


   Heavenward! doth His Spirit cry,

   Oft as in His word I hear Him;

   Pointing to the rest on high

   Where I shall be ever near Him.

   When His word fills all my thought,

   Oft to heaven my soul is caught.


   Heavenward still I long to haste,

   When Thy supper, Lord, is given;

   Heavenly strength on earth I taste,

   Feeding on the Bread of Heaven;

   Such is e'en on earth our fare,

   Who Thy marriage feast will share.


   Heavenward! To that blessed home

   Death at last will surely lead me;

   All my trials overcome,

   Christ with life and joy will feed me;

   Who Himself hath gone before

   That we too might heavenward soar.


   Heavenward! This thall be my cry

   While a pilgrim here I wander,

   Passing earth's allurements by

   For the love of what is yonder;

   Heavenward all my being tends,

   Till in Heaven my journey ends.

   Take me, take me hence with Thee,

   Or abide, Lord, still in me;

   Leave Thy heart still inly near me,

   Take mine hence where Thou art gone,

   Open heaven to me, and hear me

   When to Thee I cry alone;

   When I cannot pray, oh plead

   Seated now at God's right hand,

   Help us here, Thy faithful band.

   My Jesus, if the Seraphim,

   Behold, O King, my soul is bending

   In lowly love before Thy throne,

   Oh say, "I choose thee for mine own,

   With faithful love thy course befriending."


   Have mercy, Lord of love, for long

   My spirit for Thy mercy sighs,

   My inmost soul hath found a tongue,

   "Be merciful, O God," she cries!

   I know Thou wilt not bid me leave Thee.

   Thou canst not show Thyself a foe

   To one for whom Thou bar'st such woe,

   Whore lost estate so sore could grieve Thee.


   Then let Thy wisdom, be my guide,

   Nor take Thy light from me away,

   Thy grace be ever at my side,

   That from Thy path I may not stray;

   But feeling that Thy hand is o'er me,

   In steadfast faith my course fulfil,

   And keep Thy word, and do Thy will,

   Thy love within, Thy heaven before me!


   Reach down and arm me with Thy hand,

   And strengthen me with inner might,

   That I through faith may strive and stand

   Though craft and force against me fight;

   That so may through me and within me

   The kingdom of Thy love be spread,

   That honours Thee, our glorious Head,

   And once a crown of light shall win me.


   To Thee I rise in faith on high,

   O bend Thou down in love to me!

   Let nothing rob me of this joy,

   That all my soul is fill'd with Thee;

   As long as here I live, yea longer,

   Thee will I honour, fear, and love,

   For when this heart hath ceas'd to move

   Than Death itself Thy Love is stronger.

   A second birth more blest.

   Thou in the Godhead, Lord,

   Though here to dwell Thou deignest,

   That I may serve Thee truly,

   And render honour duly

   Clothed in righteousness divine,

   Wearing robes of dazzling whiteness,

   That unstain'd shall ever shine,

   Whence came all this fair array?


   They are those whose hearts were riven

   Who by day and night have striven

   With the mighty God in prayer;

   True Shepherd, who in love most deep

   Did watch and suffer for Thy sheep,

   To Teach and rule and serve Thy fold;


   We thank Thee for that gracious care,

   And pray that now and everywhere

   Be faithful shepherds, like their Lord.


   Yea, all who own Thee for their Head,

   Oh let them in Thy footsteps tread,

   Owning and loving more Thy cross

   Through persecution, shame, or loss.


   No better trophy hath this day

   Than hearts new-kindled to obey

   The call, for Thee that bids them live,

   And gladly yield all earth can give.


   Nor for ourselves we pray alone,

   In Thee Thy Church is ever one.

   Unite us here in faith and love

   Until we worship Thee above.

   Thy people's joy and love,

   Dawn by Thy Spirit hither,

   We gladly come to prove

   Thy presence in Thy temple,

   And wait with earnest mind,

   As Simeon once had waited

   His Saviour God to find.


   Yes, Lord, Thy servants meet Thee,

   Ev'n nuw, in ev'ry place,

   Where Thy true word hath promised

   That they should see Thy face.

   Thou yet wilt gently grant us,

   Who gather round Thee here,

   In faith's strong arms to bear Thee,

   As once that aged seer.


   Be Thou our joy, our brightness,

   That shines 'mid pain and loss,

   Our Sun in times of terror,

   The glory round our cross;

   A glow in sinking spirits,

   A sunbeam in distress,

   Physician, friend in sickness;

   In death our happiness.


   Let us, O Lord, be faithful

   That so his dying song may

   From all our hearts ascend;

   "O Lord, now let Thy servant

   Depart in peace for aye,

   Since I have seen my Saviour,

   My Saviour, I behold Thee

   Now with the eye of faith;

   No foe of Thee can rob me,

   Though bitter words he saith;

   Within Thy heart abiding,

   As Thou dost dwell in me,

   No pain, no death has terrors

   To part my soul from Thee!

   Thy kinswoman thou seekest now,

   There thy faith to cheer and stir

   Through what God hath wrought for her.


   My faith, alas! is weak,

   And where it sees not plainly

   It strives to grasp but vainly,

   And scarcely cares new strength to seek;

   Seeing now what God can do,

   May my faith grow stronger too!


   Thou Pearl of women, here

   Hast to His will resign'd thee,

   Thou wilt not look behind thee;

   Thy tender heart, towards one so dear

   To thy friends, doth warmly glow,

   Loving service fain would show.

   God! I lament to Thee,

   My will towards good is idle,

   And yet I scarce can bridle

   Its sinful impulses in me;

   May my course hereafter prove

   Rich in good works and in love!


   At last thou goest forth,

   Most loving soul and fairest,

   With thee thy Lord thou bearest;

   The Father's Word come down to earth.

   Happy thou! that He will be

   Thus companion unto thee.


   The world is such a place,

   And we must fear, if lonely

   We meet the end that comes apace.

   Walk with Thee through life and death!

   Speak ye peace, thus saith our God;

   Comfort those who sit in darkness,

   Mourning 'neath their sorrows' load;

   Speak ye to Jerusalem

   Of the peace that waits for them,

   Tell her that her sins I cover,

   And her warfare now is over.


   Yea, her sins our God will pardon,

   Blotting out each dark misdeed;

   All that well deserved His anger

   He will no more see nor heed.

   She hath suffer'd many a day,

   Now her griefs have passed away,

   God will change her pining sadness

   Into ever-springing gladness.


   For Elijah's voice is crying

   In the desert far and near,

   Bidding all men to repentance,

   Since the kingdom now is here.

   Oh that warning cry obey,

   Now prepare for God a way;

   Let the valleys rise to meet Him,

   And the hills bow down to greet Him.


   Make ye straight what long was crooked,

   Make the rougher places plain,

   Let your hearts be true and humble,

   As befits His holy reign;

   O wondrous food of blessing,

   O cup that heals our woes,

   My heart this gift possessing

   Thou, Lord, art well-contented

   With this my only sacrifice.

   I know that in my weakness

   Thou wilt despise me not,

   But grant me in Thy meekness

   The favour I have sought!

   Yes, Thou wilt deign in grace to heed

   The song that now I raise,

   For meet and right is it indeed

   That I should sing Thy praise.


   Grant what I have partaken

   May through Thy grace so work in me,

   That sin be all forsaken,

   And I may cleave alone to Thee,

   And all my soul be heedful

   How she Thy love may know:

   For this alone is needful,

   Thy love should in me glow;

   Descend to set me free?

   Have I not seen Him dying

   For us on yonder tree?

   Have I not heard him crying,

   Arise and follow me?


   For ever will I love Him

   Who saw my hopeless plight,

   Who felt my sorrows move Him,

   And brought me life and light;

   Whose arm shall be around me

   When my last hour is come,

   And suffer none to wound me,

   Though dark the passage home.


   He gives me pledges holy,

   His body and His blood,

   He lifts the scorn'd, the lowly,

   He makes my courage good,

   For He will reign within me,

   And shed His graces there;

   The heaven He died to win me

   Can I then fail to share?


   In joy and sorrow ever

   Shine through me, Blessed Heart,

   Who bleeding for us, never

   Didst shrink from sorest smart!

   Whate'er I've lov'd, or striven,

   Or borne, I bring to Thee,

   Now let Thy heart and heaven

   Stand open, Lord, to me.

   Nun lasst uns den Leib begraben

   [296]M. Weiss, 1531


   Now lay we calmly in the grave

   This form, whereof no doubt we have

   That it shall rise again that day,

   In glorious triumph o'er decay.


   And so to earth again we trust

   What came from dust, and turns to dust,

   And from the dust shall surely rise

   When the last trumpet fills the skies.


   His soul is living now in God

   Whose grace his pardon hath bestow'd,

   Who through His Son redeem'd him here

   From bondage unto sin and fear.


   His trials and his griefs are past,

   A blessed end is his at last;

   He bore Christ's yoke, and did His will,

   And though he died he liveth still.


   He lives where none can mourn and weep,

   And calmly shall this body sleep

   Till God shall Death himself destroy

   And raise it into glorious joy.


   He suffer'd pain and grief below,

   Christ heals him now from all his woe;

   For him hath endless joy begun;

   He shines in glory like the sun.


   Then let us leave him to his rest,

   And homeward turn, for he is blest,

   And we must well our souls prepare,

   When death shall come, to meet him there.


   So help us, Christ, our Hope in loss!

   Thou hast redeem'd us by Thy cross

   From endless death and misery;

   We praise, we bless, we worship Thee!

   Hört auf mit Trauern und mit Klag'

   [298]N. Hermann, 1560


   Now hush your cries, and shed no tear,

   On such death none should look with fear;

   He died a faithful Christian man,

   And with his death true life began.


   Coffin and grave we deck with care,

   His body reverently we bear,

   It is not dead but rests in God,

   And softly sleeps beneath the sod.


   It seems as all were over now,--

   The heavy limbs, the soulless brow,--

   Yet through these rigid limbs once more

   A nobler life, ere long, shall pour.


   These dead dry bones again shall feel

   New warmth and vigour through them steal

   Reknit and living they shall soar

   On high where Christ lives evermore.


   This body, lying stiff and stark,

   Shall rise unharm'd from out the dark,

   And swiftly mount up through the skies

   Even as the spirit heavenwards flies.


   The buried grain of wheat must die,

   Wither'd and worthless long must lie,

   Yet springs to light all sweet and fair,

   And proper fruits shall richly bear:


   Even so this body made of dust,

   To earth we once again entrust,

   And painless it shall slumber here,

   Until the Last Great Day appear.


   God breathed into this house of clay

   The spirit that hath pass'd away,

   Christ gave the true courageous mind,

   The noble heart, ye no more find.


   Now earth has hid it from our eyes,

   Till God shall bid it wake and rise,

   Who ne'er the creature will forget,

   On whom His image He hath set.


   Ah would that promised Day were here,

   When Christ shall once again appear;

   When He shall call, nor one be lost,

   To endless life earth's buried host!

   He has what we are wanting,

   He sees what we believes,

   The sins on earth so haunting

   Have there no power to grieve;

   Safe in His Saviour's keepings

   Who sent him calm release,--

   'Tis only we are weeping,

   He dwells in perfect peace.


   The crown of life he weareth.

   He bears the shining palm,

   The "Holy, holy," heareth,

   And joins the angels' psalm;

   Still through this land of woe,

   And tends the Church asunder.


   Therefore, saith God, I will arise,

   These men my poor are wronging,

   And I will grant their longing;

   My striving Word shall take the field,

   Shall be the poor man's strength and shield,

   And all my foes shall conquer.


   As silver that through fire hath passed

   Is pure from all its drosses,

   So shall God's Word shine forth at last

   The brighter for these crosses;

   Through trial is its power made known,

   Till all men far and near shall own

   How pure and strong its glory.


   Therefore, O God, preserve it pure

   From all that would abuse it,

   And in the Faith our hearts secure,

   That we may never lose it;

   For trouble and rebuke shall be

   If your bonds are yet too weak,

   If but fragile yet they prove,

   Help from His good Spirit seek

   Who can steel the chains of love.

   Wake the dead, new followers call,

   Touch the slothful with Thy flame.

   For the flesh, we only pray

   Thou wouldA do as seems Thee best,

   Ere yet comes our parting day;

   But our spirit clings to Thee,

   Will not, dare not, let Thee go,

   Until Thou have set her free

   From the bonds that cause her woe.


   Ours the fault it is, we own,

   We are slaves to self and sloth,

   Yet oh leave us not alone

   In the living death we loathe!

   Crush'd beneath our burden's weight,

   Crying at Thy feet we fall,

   Point the path, though steep and strait,

   Thou didst open once for all.


   Ah how dearly were we bought

   Not to serve the world or sin;

   By the work that Thou hast wrought

   Must Thou make us pure within,

   Wholly pure and free,--in us

   Be Thine image now restored:

   Fill'd from out Thy fulness thus

   Grace for grace on us is pour'd.


   Draw us to Thy cross, O Love,

   Crucify with Thee whate'er

   Cannot dwell with Thee above;

   Lead us to those regions fair!

   Courage! long the time may seem,

   Yet His day is coming fast;

   We shall be like them that dream

   When our freedom dawns at last.

   Allein zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ

   [342]Schneesing, 1522


   Lord Jesu Christ, in Thee alone

   My only hope on earth I place,

   For other comforter is none,

   No help have I but in Thy grace.

   There is no man nor creature here,

   No angel in the heav'nly sphere,

   Who at my need can succour me;

   I cry to Thee,

   For Thou canst end my misery.


   My sin is very sore and great,

   I weep and mourn its load beneath;

   O free me from this heavy weight,

   My Saviour, through Thy precious death;

   And with my Father for me plead

   That Thou hast suffer'd in my stead;

   From me the burden then is roll'd,

   And I lay hold

   On Thy dear promises of old.


   And of Thy mercy now bestow

   True Christian faith on me, O Lord!

   That all the sweetness I may know

   That in Thy holy cross is stored;

   Love Thee o'er earthly pride or pelf,

   And love my neighbour as myself;

   And when at last is come my end,

   Be Thou my Friend,

   From all assaults my soul defend.


   Glory to God in highest heaven,

   The Father of eternal love;

   To His clear Son, for sinners given,

   Whose watchful grace we daily prove;

   To God the Holy Ghost on high;

   Oh ever be His comfort nigh,

   And teach us, free from sin and fear,

   To please Him here,

   And serve Him in the sinless sphere!

   O reines Wesen, lautre Quelle

   [344]Freylinghausen, 1713


   Pure essence! Spotless Fount of Light,

   That fadeth never into dark!

   O Thou, whose eyes, more clear and bright

   Than noonday sun, are quick to mark

   Our sins; lo, bare before Thy face

   Lies all the desert of my heart,

   My once fair soul in ev'ry part

   Now stain'd with evil foul and base.


   Since but the pure in heart are blest

   With promised vision of their God,

   Sore fear and anguish fill my breast,

   Rememb'ring all the ways I trod;

   Mourning I see my lost estate,

   And yet in faith I dare to cry,

   Oh let my evil nature die,

   Another heart in me create!


   Enough, Lord, that my foe too well

   Hath lured me once away from Thee;

   Henceforth I know his craft how fell,

   And all his deep-laid snares I flee.

   Lord, through the Spirit whom Thy Son

   Hath bidden us in prayer to ask,

   Arm us with might that every task,

   Whate'er we do, in Thee be done.


   Unworthy am I of Thy grace,

   So deep are my transgressions, Lord,

   And yet once more I seek Thy face;

   My God, have mercy, nor reward

   My sins and follies, dark and vain;

   Reject, reject me not in wrath,

   But let Thy sunshine now beam forth,

   And quicken me with hope again.


   The Holy Spirit Thou hast given,

   The wondrous pledge of love divine,

   Who fills our hearts with joys of heaven,

   And bids us earthly toys resign;

   Oh let His seal be on my heart,

   Oh take Him nevermore away,

   Until this fleshly house decay,

   And Thou shalt bid me hence depart.


   But ah! my coward spirit droops,

   Sick with the fear that enters in

   Whene'er a soul to bondage stoops,

   And wears the shameful yoke of sin;

   Oh quicken with the strength that flows

   From out the Eternal Fount of Life,

   My soul half-fainting in the strife,

   And make an end of all my woes.


   I cling unto Thy grace alone,

   Thy steadfast oath my only rest;

   To Thee, Heart-searcher, all is known

   That lieth hidden in my breast;

   Thy Joy, O Spirit, on me pour,

   Thy servent will my sloth inspire,

   So shall I have my heart's desire,

   And serve and praise Thee evermore.

   Our Father, Thou in heav'n above,

   Who biddest us to dwell in love,

   As brethren of one family,

   And cry for all we need to Thee;

   Teach us to mean the words we say,

   And from the inmost heart to pray.


   All hallow'd be Thy name, O Lord!

   Oh let us firmly keep Thy Word,

   And lead, according to Thy name,

   A holy life, untouch'd by blame;

   Let no false teachings do us hurt--

   All poor deluded souls convert.


   Thy kingdom come! Thine let it be

   In time, and through eternity!

   Oh let Thy Holy Spirit dwell

   With us, to rule and guide us well;

   From Satan's mighty power and rage

   Preserve Thy Church from age to age.


   Thy will be done on earth, O Lord,

   As where in heaven Thou art adored!

   Patience in time of grief below,

   Obedience true through weal and woe;

   Strength, tempting wishes to control

   That thwart Thy will within the soul.


   Give us to-day our daily bread,

   Let us be duly clothed and fed,

   And keep Thou from our homes afar

   Famine and pestilence and war,

   That we may live in godly peace,

   Unvex'd by cares and avarice.


   Forgive our sins, that they no more

   May grieve and haunt us as before,

   As we forgive their trespasses

   Who unto us have done amiss;

   Thus let us dwell in charity,

   And serve each other willingly.


   Into temptation lead us not,

   And when the foe doth war and plot

   Against our souls on every hand,

   Then, arm'd with faith, oh may we stand

   Against him as a valiant host,

   Through comfort of the Holy Ghost


   Deliver us from evil, Lord,

   The days are dark and foes abroad;

   Redeem us from the second death,

   And when we yield our dying breath,

   Console us, grant us calm release,

   And take our souls to Thee in peace.


   Amen! that is, so let it be!

   Strengthen our faith and trust in Thee,

   That we may doubt not, but believe

   That what we ask, we shall receive;

   Thus in Thy name and at Thy word

   We say Amen, now hear us, Lord!

   O God, Thou faithful God,

   Thou Fountain ever flowing,

   Without whom nothing is,

   All perfect gifts bestowing;

   A pure and healthy fram

   O give me, and within

   A conscience free from blame,

   A soul unhurt by sin.


   And grant me, Lord, to do,

   With ready heart and willing,

   Whate'er Thou shalt command,

   My calling here fulfilling,

   And do it when I ought,

   With all my strength, and bless

   The work I thus have wrought,

   For Thou must give success.


   And let me promise nought

   But I can keep it truly,

   Abstain from idle words,

   And guard my lips still duly;

   And grant, when in my place

   I must and ought to speak,

   My words due power and grace,

   Nor let me wound the weak.


   If dangers gather round,

   Still keep me calm and fearless;

   Help me to bear the cross

   When life is dark and cheerless;

   To overcome my foe

   With words and actions kind;

   When counsel I would know,

   Good counsel let me find.


   And let me be with all

   In peace and friendship living,

   As far as Christians may.

   And if Thou aught art giving

   Of wealth and honours fair,

   Oh this refuse me not,

   That nought be mingled there

   Of goods unjustly got.


   And if a longer life

   Be here on earth decreed me,

   And Thou through many a strife

   To age at last wilt lead me,

   Thy patience in me shed,

   Avert all sin and shame,

   And crown my hoary head

   With pure untarnish'd fame.


   Let nothing that may chance,

   Me from my Saviour sever;

   And dying with Him, take

   My soul to Thee for ever;

   And let my body have

   A little apace to sleep

   Beside my fathers' grave,

   And friends that o'er it weep.


   And when the Day is come,

   And all the dead are waking,

   Oh reach me down Thy hand,

   Thyself my slumbers breaking;

   Then let me hear Thy voices

   And change this earthly frame,

   And bid me aye rejoice

   With those who love Thy name.

   Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ

   [359]Anon., 1529


   Lord, hear the voice of my complaint,

   To Thee I now commend me,

   Let not my heart and hope grow faint,

   But deign Thy grace to send me;

   True faith from Thee, my God, I seek,

   The faith that loves Thee solely,

   Keeps me lowly,

   And prompt to aid the weak,

   And mark each word that Thou dost speak.


   Yet more from Thee I dare to claim,

   Whose goodness is unbounded;

   Oh let me ne'er be put to shame,

   My hope be ne'er confounded;

   But e'en in death still find Thee true,

   And in that hour, else lonely,

   Trust Thee only,

   Not aught that I can do,

   For such false trust I sore should rue.


   Oh grant that from my very heart

   My foes be all forgiven,

   Forgive my sins and heal their smart,

   And grant new life from heaven;

   Thy word, that blessed food, bestow,

   Which best the soul canst nourish;

   Make it flourish

   Through all the storms of woe

   That else my faith might overthrow.


   Then be the world my foe or friend,

   Keep me to her a stranger,

   Thy steadfast soldier to the end,

   Through pleasure and through danger;

   From Thee alone comes such high grace,

   No works of ours obtain it,

   Or can gain it;

   Our pride hath here no place,

   'Tis Thy free promise we embrace.


   Help me, for I am weak; I fight,

   Yet scarce can battle longer;

   I cling but to Thy grace and might,

   'Tis Thou must make me stronger;

   When sore temptations are my lot,

   And tempests round me lower,

   Break their power.

   So, through deliverance wrought,

   I know that Thou forsak'st me not!

   Dir, dir, Jehovah, will ich singen

   [361]Crasselius, 1697


   Jehovah, let me now adore Thee,

   For where is there a God such, Lord, as Thou?

   With songs I fain would come before Thee;

   Oh let Thy Spirit deign to touch me now

   To praise Thee in His name, through whome alone

   Our songs can please Thee, through Thy blessed Son.


   Yes, draw me to the Son, O Father,

   That so the Son may draw me up to Thee.

   Let every power within me gather,

   To own Thy sway, O Spirit,--rule in me,

   That so the peace of God may in me dwell,

   And I may sing for joy and praise Thee well.


   Grant me Thy Spirit; then my praises

   Will sound aright, no jarring tone or word;

   Sweet are the songs the heart then raises,

   Then I can pray in truth and spirit, Lord;

   Thy Spirit bears mine up on eagles' wing,

   To join the psalms the heavenly choirs now sing.


   For He can plead for me with sighings

   That are unutterable to lips like mine;

   He bids me pray with earnest cryings,

   Bears witness with my soul that I am Thine,

   Co-heir with Christ, and thus may dare to say,

   O Abba, Father, hear me when I pray.


   When thus Thy Spirit in me burneth,

   And makes this cry to break from out my heart,

   Thy heart, O Father, toward me yearneth,

   And longs all precious blessings to impart,

   Thy ready love rejoiceth to fulfil

   The prayer breathed out according to Thy will.


   And what Thy Spirit thus hath taught me

   To seek from Thee, must needs be such a prayer

   As Thou wilt grant, through Him who bought me,

   And raised me up to be Thy child and heir;

   In Jesu's name fearless I seek Thy face,

   And take from Thee, my Father, grace for grace.


   O joy! our hope and trust are founded

   On His sure Word, and witness in the heart;

   I know Thy mercies are unbounded,

   And all good gifts Thou freely wilt impart,

   Nay, more is lavish'd by Thy bounteous hand,

   Than we can ask or seek or understand.


   O joy! In His name we draw near Thee,

   Who ever pleadeth for the sons of men;

   I ask in faith and Thou wilt hear me,

   In Him Thy promises are all Amen.

   O joy for me! and praise be ever Thine,

   Whose wondrous love has made such blessings mine!

   As toward her sun the sunflower turns,

   Towards Thee, my Sun, my spirit yearns!

   Oh would that free from sin I might

   Ah how shall I my freedom win?

   How break this heavy yoke of sin?

   My fainting spirit thirsts for Thee,

   Come, Lord, to help and set me free.


   My heart is set to do Thy will,

   But all my deeds are faulty still;

   My best attempts are nothing worth.

   But soil'd with cleaving taint of earth.


   Remember that I am Thy child,

   Forgive whate'er my soul defiled,

   Freely to Thee beyond the skies.


   Help me to love the world no more,

   Be Master of my house and store,

   The shield of faith around me throw,

   And break the arrows of my foe.


   Fain would my heart henceforward be

   Fix'd, O my God, alone on Thee,

   That heart and foul, by Thee possest,

   May find in Thee their perfect rest.


   Begone, ye pleasures false and vain,

   Untasted, undesired remain!

   In heaven alone those joys abound,

   Where aII my true delight is found.


   Oh take away whate'er has stood

   Their dreaded Prince no more

   Harms us as of yore;

   Look grim as he may,

   Doom'd is his ancient sway,

   A word can overthrow him.


   Still shall they leave that Word His might,

   And yet no thanks shall merit;

   Still is He with us in the fight

   By His good gifts and Spirit.

   E'en should they take our life,

   Wealth, name, child, or wife--

   Though all these be gone,

   Yet nothing have they won,

   God's kingdom ours abideth!

   Mache dich, mein Geist, bereit

   [387]Freystein, 1697


   Rise, my soul, to watch and pray,

   From thy sleep awake thee,

   Lest at last the evil day

   Suddenly o'ertake thee;

   For the foe,

   Well we know,

   Oft his harvest reapeth

   While the Christian sleepeth.


   Wake and watch, or else thy night

   Christ can ne'er enlighten;

   For off still will seem the light

   That thy path should brighten;

   God demands

   Willing hands,

   Hearts His love confessing,--

   Such He fills with blessing.


   Watch against the world that frowns

   Darkly to dismay thee;

   Watch, when she thy wishes crowns,

   Smiling to betray thee;

   Watch and see

   Thou art free

   From false friends that charm thee,

   While they seek to harm thee.


   Watch against thyself, my soul,

   See thou do not stifle

   Grace that should thy thoughts control,

   Nor with mercy trifle

   Pride and sin

   Lurk within,

   All thy hopes to scatter;

   List not, when they flatter.


   But while watching, also see

   That thou pray unceasing,

   For the Lord must make thee free,

   Strength and faith increasing,

   So to do

   Service true;

   Let not sloth enslave thee,

   Pray, and He will save thee.


   Courage then, for He will give

   All that we are needing,

   Through the Son, in whom we live,

   Who for us is pleading.

   Day by day

   Watch and pray,

   While the tempests lower,

   Till He comes with power.

   Brich durch, mein angefochtnes Herz

   [389]Böhmer, 1704


   Courage, my sorely-tempted heart!

   Break through thy woes, forget their smart;

   Come forth and on thy Bridegroom gaze,

   The Lamb of God, the Fount of grace;

   Here is thy place!


   His arms are open, thither flee!

   There rest and peace are waiting thee,

   The deathless crown of righteousness,

   The entrance to eternal bliss;

   He gives thee this!


   Then combat well, of nought afraid,

   For thus His follower thou art made,

   Each battle teaches thee to fight,

   Each foe to be a braver knight,

   Arm'd with His might.


   If storms of fierce temptation rise,

   Unmoved I'll face the frowning skies;

   If but the heart is true indeed,

   Christ will be with me in my need,--

   His own could bleed.


   I flee away to Thy dear Cross,

   For hope is there for every loss,

   Healing for every wound and woe,

   There all the strength of love I know,

   And feel its glow.


   Before the Holy One I fall,

   The Eternal Sacrifice for all;

   His death has freed us from our load,

   Peace on the anguish'd soul bestow'd,

   Brought us to God.


   How then thould I go mourning on?

   I look to Thee,--my fears are gone,

   With Thee is rest that cannot cease,

   For Thou hast wrought us full release,

   And made our peace.


   Thy word hath still its glorious powers,

   The noblest cbivalry is ours;

   O Thou, for whom to die is gain,

   Bring Thee here my all, oh deign

   T'accept and reign!

   Whether for me the race is run,

   My sins are more than I can bear,

   To Him I live and die alone,

   Death cannot part Him from His own;

   Living or dying, I am His

   Who only is

   Our comfort, and our gate of bliss.


   This is my solace, day by days

   When snares and death beset my way,

   I know that at the morn of doom

   From out the tomb

   With joy to meet Him I shall come.


   Then I shall see God face to face,

   Amid the joys prepared for me

   Thanks be to Thee

   Who givest us the victory!


   Amen, dear God! now send us faith,

   Well He knows how best to grant me

   All the longing hopes that haunt me;

   All things have their proper day;

   I would dictate to Him never,

   As God wills so be it ever,

   When He wills I will obey.


   If on earth He bids me linger,

   He will guide me with His finger

   Through the years that now took dim;

   All that earth has fleets and changes

   As a river onward ranges,

   But I rest in peace on Him.

   Poor as the poorest here I pine,

   In Thee a heav'nly kingdom's mine.

   Thou seest it, and pitiest me;

   Thy swift compassions hither speed,

   Ere yet my woes are told to Thee;

   Thou hearest, Father, ere we cry,

   Shall I not still before Thee lie?


   I leave to Thee whate'er is mine,

   And in Thy will I calmly rest;

   I know that richest gifts are Thine,

   Thou canst and Thou wilt make me blest,

   For Thou hath promised, and our Lord

   Will never break His promised word.


   Thou lov'st me, Father, with the love

   Wherewith Thou lovedst Christ Thy Son,

   And so a brightness from above

   Still glads me though my tears may run,

   For in Thy love I find and know

   What all the world could ne'er bestow.

   And yet be still and rest in Thee,

   Wer nur den lieben Gott lässt walten

   [421]Neumarck, 1653


   If thou but suffer God to guide thee,

   And hope in Him through all thy ways,

   He'll give thee strength whate'er betide thee,

   And bear the through the evil days.

   Who trust in God's unchanging love

   Builds on the rock that nought can move.


   What can these anxious cares avail thee,

   These never-ceasing moans and sighs?

   What can it help, if thou bewail thee

   O'er each dark moment as it flies?

   Our cross and trials do but press

   The heavier for our bitterness.


   Only be still and wait His leisure

   In cheerful hope, with heart content

   To take whate'er thy Father's pleasure

   And all-deserving love hath sent,

   Nor doubt our inmost wants are known

   To Him who chose us for His own.


   He knows the time for joy, and truly

   Will send it when He sees it meet,

   When He has tried and purged thee throughly

   And finds thee free from all deceit,

   He comes to thee all unaware

   And makes thee own His loving care.


   Nor think amid the heat of trial

   That God hath cast thee off unheard,

   That he whose hopes meet no denial

   Must surely be of God preferred;

   Time passes and much change doth bring,

   And sets a bound to everything.


   All are alike before the Highest.

   'Tis easy to our God, we know,

   To raise thee up though low thou liest,

   To make the rich man poor and low;

   True wonders still by Him are wrought

   Who setteth up and brings to nought.


   Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,

   So do thine own part faithfully,

   And trust His Word, though undeserving,

   Thou yet shalt find it true for thee!

   God never yet forsook at need

   The soul that trusted Him indeed.

   Sweet comfort yet shall fill my heart,

   And pain and sorrow shall depart.

   My Father's care

   Is around me there,

   Ah God, my days are dark indeed,

   How oft this aching heart must bleed;

   The narrow way, how fill'd with pain,

   That I must pass ere heav'n I gain!

   How hard to teach this flesh and blood

   To seek alone th'Eternal Good!


   Ah whither now for comfort turn?

   For Thee, my Jesus, do I yearn,

   In Thee have I, howe'er distrest,

   Found ever counsel, aid, and rest;

   I cannot all forsaken be

   While still my heart can trust in Thee.


   Jesus, my only God and Lord,

   What sweetness in Thy name is stored!

   So dark and hopeless is no grief

   But Thy sweet Name can bring relief,

   So keen no sorrows' rankling dart

   But Thy sweet Name can heal my heart.


   The world can show no truth like Thine,

   And therefore will I not repine;

   I know Thou wilt forsake me not,

   Thy truth is fix'd, though dark my lot;

   Thou art my Shepherd, and Thy sheep

   From every real harm Thou wilt keep.


   Jesus, my boast, my light, my joy,

   The treasure nought can e'er destroy,

   No words, no song that I can frame

   Speak half the sweetness of Thy name!

   They only all its power shall prove

   Whose hearts have learnt Thy faith and love.


   How many a time I've sadly said,

   Far better were it I were dead,

   Far better ne'er the light to see

   If I had not this joy in Thee;

   For he who hath not Thee in faith,

   His very life is merely death.


   Jesus, my Bridegroom and my crown,

   If Thou but smile, the world may frown,

   In Thee lie depths ofjoy untold,

   Far richer than her richest gold;

   Whene'er I do but think of Thee,

   Thy dews drop down and solace me;


   Whene'er I hope in Thee, my Friend

   Thy comfort and Thy peace descend;

   Whene'er in grief I pray and sing,

   I feel new courage in me spring;

   Thy Spirit witnesses that this

   Is foretaste of the eternal bliss.


   Then while I live this life of care

   The cross for Thee I'll gladly bear

   Grant me a patient, willing mood,

   I know that it shall work my good;

   Help me to do my task aright,

   That it may stand before Thy sight.


   Let me this flesh and blood control,

   From sin and shame preserve my soul,

   And keep me steadfast in the faith,

   Then I am Thine in life and death;

   Jesys, Consoler, bend to me,

   Ah would I were e'en now with Thee!

   But take me hence on high;

   My fearful heart, oh strengthen,

   And let me calmly die.


   When all around is darkling,

   Thy name and cross, still bright,

   Deep in my heart are sparkling,

   Like stars in blackest night;

   What matters pain when past?

   Hath he a cause to murmur

   Who reaches heaven at last?


   Oh write my name, I pray Thee,

   For ever bloom before Thee,

   Thy perfect freedom prove,

   In Thy heart and hands, my God,

   Calmly now my soul reposes,

   Waiting patiently the end

   That Thy aim in all discloses;

   Stripp'd of self, how sweet her rest

   On her loving Father's breast.


   And my soul repineth not,

   Well content whate'er befall her;

   Murmurs, wishes, of self-will,

   Doom'd to death, no more enthrall her;

   Restless thoughts, that fret and crave,

   Slumber in her Saviour's grave.


   And my soul doth cease from cares,

   From the thoughts that sore perplex us,

   That destroy the inner peace,

   For like sharpest thorns they vex us;

   He who made her careth well,

   She but seeks in peace to dwell.


   And my soul despaireth not,

   Loves Him most when sad and lonely;

   Grief that wrings and breaks the heart

   Comes to those who hate Him only;

   They who love Him still possess

   Comfort in their worst distress.


   And my soul complaineth not,

   For no pain or fears dismay her,

   Still she clings to God in faith,

   Trusts Him though He seem to slay her.

   'T is when flesh and blood repine,

   Sun of joy, Thou canst not thine.


   Thus my soul is still and waits,

   Every murmuring word she hushes,

   Conquering thus the pain or wrong

   That the restless spirit crushes;

   Like a silent ocean, bright

   With her Maker's praise and light.

   To your tower of refuge fly!

   Know He is the Living God,

   Ever to His creatures nigh.

   Seek His ever-open door

   In your hours of utmost need;

   All your hearts before Him pour,

   He will send you help with speed.


   But hast thou some darling plan,

   Cleaving to the things of earth?

   Leanest thou for aid on man?

   Thou wilt find him nothing worth.

   Rather trust the One alone

   Whose is endless power and love,

   And the help He gives His own

   Thou in very deed shalt prove.


   Yea, on Thee, my God, I rest,

   Letting life float calmly on,

   For I know the last is best,

   When the crown of joy is won.

   In Thy might all things I bear,

   In Thy love find bitters sweet,

   And with all my grief and care

   Sit in patience at Thy feet.


   O my soul, why art thou vex'd?

   Let things go as e'en they will;

   Though to thee they seem perplex'd,

   Yet His order they fulfil.

   Here He is Thy strength and guard,

   Power to harm thee here has none;

   Yonder will He each reward

   For the works he here has done.


   Let Thy mercy's wings be spread

   O'er me, keep me close to Thee,

   In the peace Thy love doth shed,

   Let me dwell eternally;

   Be my All; in all I do

   Let me only seek Thy will,

   Where the heart to Thee is true,

   All is peaceful, calm, and still.

   Original Tune.
   Sheet Music

   Von Gott will ich nicht lassen

   [433]Helmbold, 1563


   From God shall nought divide me,

   For He is true for aye,

   And on my path will guide me,

   Who else should often stray;

   His ever-bounteous hand

   By night and day is heedful,

   And gives me what is needful,

   Where'er I go or stand.


   If sorrow comes, He sent it,

   In Him I put my trust;

   I never shall repent it,

   For He is true and just,

   And loves to bless us still;

   My life and soul, I owe them

   To Him who doth bestow them,

   Let Him do as He will.


   Whate'er shall be His pleasure

   Is surely best for me;

   He gave His dearest treasure

   That our weak hearts might see

   How good His will t'ward us;

   And in His Son He gave us

   Whate'er could bless and save us;--

   Praise Him who loveth thus!


   Oh praise Him, for He never

   Forgets our daily need;

   Oh blest the hour whenever

   To Him our thoughts can speed;

   Yes, all the time we spend

   Without Him is but wasted,

   Till we His joy have tasted,

   The joy that hath no end.


   For when the'world is passing

   With all its pomp and pride,

   All we were here amassing

   No longer may abide;

   But in our earthy bed,

   Where softly we are sleeping,

   God hath us in His keeping,

   To wake us from the dead.


   Then though on earth I suffer

   Much trial, well I know

   I merit ways still rougher,

   And 'tis to heaven I go;

   For Christ I know and love,

   To Him I now am hasting,

   And gladness everlasting

   With Him this heart shall prove.


   For such His will who made us,

   The Father seeks our good;

   The Son hath grace to aid us,

   And save us by His blood;

   His Spirit rules our ways,

   By faith in us abiding,

   To heaven our footsteps guiding;

   To Him be thanks and praise.

   Sheet Music

   Wenn wir in höchsten Nöthen sein

   [435]Paul Eber, 1567


   When in the hour of utmost need

   We know not where to look for aid,

   When days and nights of anxious thought

   Nor help nor counsel yet have brought,--


   Then this our comfort is alone,

   That we may meet before Thy throne,

   And cry, O faithful God, to Thee

   For rescue from our misery:


   To Thee may raise our hearts and eyes,

   Repenting sore with bitter sighs,

   And seek Thy pardon for our sin,

   And respite from our griefs within:


   For Thou hast promised graciously

   To hear all those who cry to Thee,

   Through Him whose Name alone is great,

   Our Saviour and our Advocate.


   And thus we come, O God, to-day,

   And all our woes before Thee lay,

   For tried, forsaken, lo! we stand,

   Perils and foes on every hand.


   Ah! hide not for our sins Thy face,

   Absolve us through Thy boundless grace,

   Be with us in our anguish still,

   Free us at last from every ill,


   That so with all our hearts we may

   Once more our glad thanksgivings pay,

   And walk obedient to Thy word,

   And now and ever praise the Lord.

   [437]Löwenstern, died 1648


   When anguish'd and perplex'd I lift my weary eyes

   Up to Thy hills, O Lord, and tell Thee all that grieves me,

   Thou hearken'st to my sighs,

   And never comfortless Thy inner presence leaves me.


   My help and my defence come, faithful God, from Thee,

   By whom were fix'd the heavens, and laid the earth's foundation;

   Man cannot succour me,

   Before Thy throne alone is refuge and salvation.


   Thou watchest that my foot should neither slip nor stray,

   Thou guidest me Thyself, though dark the course I travel;

   Thou pointest me the way,

   The snares of sin and earth for me Thou dost unravel.


   Guardian of Israel, Thou no rest or sleep dost know,

   Thy watchful eye beholds in earth's obscurest regions

   Who bravely meets Thy foe,

   And bears the Cross on high, still true to our allegiance.


   And when Thou bidd'st me leave this world of strife and pain,

   A steadfast hope in Thee, a quick release, oh grant me,

   And let me rise again,

   To dwell where death and war no more shall vex and haunt me.

   Warum betrübst du dich, mein Herz

   [439]Hans Sachs, 1552


   Why art thou thus cast down, my heart?

   Why troubled, why dost mourn apart,

   O'er nought but earthly wealth?

   Trust in thy God, be not afraid,

   He is thy Friend who all things made.


   Dost think thy prayers He doth not heed?

   He knows full well what thou dost need,

   And heaven and earth are His;

   My Father and my God, who still

   Is with my soul in every ill.


   Since Thou my God and Father art,

   I know Thy faithful loving heart

   Will ne'er forget Thy child;

   See I am poor, I am but dust,

   On earth is none whom I can trust.


   The rich man in his wealth confides,

   But in my God my trust abides;

   Then laugh ye as ye will,

   I hold this fast that He hath taught,--

   Who trusts in God shall want for nought.


   Yes, Lord, Thou art as rich to-day

   As Thou hast been and shalt be aye,

   I rest on Thee alone;

   Thy riches to my soul be given,

   And 't is enough for earth and heaven.


   What here may shine I all resign,

   If the eternal crown be mine,

   That through Thy bitter death

   Thou gainedst, O Lord Christ, for me--

   For this, for this, I cry to Thee!


   All wealth, all glories, here below,

   The best that this world can bestow,

   Silver or gold or lands,

   But for a little time is given,

   And helps us not to enter heaven.


   I thank Thee, Christ, Eternal Lord,

   That Thou hast taught me by Thy word

   To know this truth and Thee;

   O grant me also steadfastness

   Thy heavenly kingdom not to miss.


   Praise, honour, thanks, to Thee be brought,

   For all things in and for me wrought

   By Thy great mercy, Christ.

   This one thing only still I pray,

   Oh cast me ne'er from Thee away.

   O Christ, Thou bright and Morning Star,

   Now shed Thy light abroad;

   Shine on us from Thy throne afar

   In this dark place, dear Lord,

   With Thy pure glorious word.


   O Jesus, Comfort of the poor,

   I trust alone to Thee.


   I cannot rest, I may not sleep,

   No joy or peace I know,

   My soul is torn with anguish deep

   And fears a deeper woe;

   O Christ, Thy pity show!


   For Thou didst suffer for my soul,

   Her burdens to remove;

   Sollt' es auch bisweilen scheinen

   [445]Titius, died 1703


   Seems it in my anguish lone,

   As though God forsook His own,

   Yet I hold this knowledge fast,

   God will surely help at last.


   Though awhile it be delay'd,

   He denieth not His aid;

   Though it come not oft with speed,

   It will surely come at need.


   As a father not too soon

   Grants his child the long'd-for boon,

   So our God gives when He will;

   Wait His leisure and be still.


   I can rest in thoughts of Him,

   When all courage else grows dim,

   For I know my soul shall prove

   His is more than father's love.


   Would the powers of ill affright,

   I can smile at all their might;

   Or the cross be pressing sore,

   God, my God, lives evermore!


   Man may hate me causelessly,

   Man may plot to ruin me,

   Foes my heart may pierce and rend;

   God in heaven is still my Friend.


   Earth may all her gifts deny,

   Safe my treasure still on high,

   And if heaven at last be mine,

   All things else I can resign.


   I renounce thee willingly,

   World, I hate what pleases thee,

   Baneful every gift of thine,

   Only be my God still mine.

   Sheet Music

   Ich bin ein Gast auf Erden

   [449]Gerhardt, 1650


   A pilgrim here I wander,

   On earth have no abode,

   My fatherland is yonder,

   My home is with my God,

   For here I journey to and fro,

   There in eternal rest

   Will God His gracious gift bestow

   On all the toil-oppress'd.


   For what hath life been giving,

   From youth up till this day,

   But constant toil and striving?

   Far back as thought can stray,

   How many a day of toil and care,

   How many a night of tears,

   Hath pass'd in grief that none could share,

   In lonely anxious fears!


   How many a storm hath lighten'd

   And thunder'd round my path!

   And winds and rains have frighten'd

   My heart with fiercest wrath:

   And cruel envy, hatred, scorn,

   Have darken'd oft my lot,

   And patiently reproach I've born,

   Though I deserved it not.


   Then through this life of dangers

   I onward take my way;

   But in this land of strangers

   I do not think to stay.

   Still forward on the road I fare

   That leads me to my home,

   My Father's comfort waits me there,

   When I have overcome.


   Ah yes, my home is yonder,

   Where all the angelic bands

   Praise Him with awe and wonder,

   In whose Almighty hands

   All things that are and shall be, lie,

   By Him upholden still,

   Who casteth down and lifts on high

   At His most holy will.


   That home have I desired,

   'Tis there I would be gone;

   Till I am well-nigh tired,

   O'er earth I've journey'd on;

   The longer here I roam, I find

   The less of real joy

   That e'er could please or fill my mind,

   For all hath some alloy.


   The lodging is too cheerless,

   The sorrow is too much;

   Ah come, my heart is fearless,

   Release it with Thy touch,

   When Thy heart wills, and make an end

   Of all this pilgrimage,

   And with Thine arm and strength defend,

   When foes against me rage.


   Where now my spirit stayeth

   Is not her true abode;

   This earthly house decayeth,

   And she will drop its load,

   When comes the hour to leave beneath

   What now I use and have;

   And when I've yielded up my breath

   Earth gives me but a grave,


   But Thou, my Joy and Gladness,

   O Thou, my Life and Light,

   Wilt raise me from this sadness,

   This long tempestuous night,

   Into the perfect gladsome day,

   Where bathed in joy divine,

   Among Thy saints, and bright as they,

   I too shall ever thine.


   There shall I dwell for ever,

   Not as a guest alone,

   With those who cease there never

   To worship at Thy throne;

   There in my heritage I rest,

   From baser things set free,

   And join the chorus of the blest

   For ever, Lord, to Thee!

   Thou art my hidden treasure;

   Let Thy grace, Lord, Warm and cheer me.

   Whoud it were Thy will to enter

   To my heart, O Thou my Star,

   Thou my Jesus, Fount of pow'r,

   Helper in the needful hour!

   Sharpest wounds my heart is feeling,

   Pour thy griefs and fears before Him.


   What would seem to hurt or shame thee

   Shall but work thy good at last;

   Since that Christ hath deign'd to claim thee,

   And His truth stands ever fast;

   And if thine can but endure,

   There is nought so fixed and sure,

   As that thou shalt hymn His praises

   In the happy heavenly places.

   Du wesentliches Wort

   [471]Laurenti, 1700


   O Thou Essential Word,

   Who wast from the beginning

   With God, for Thou wast God;

   Thou hope of all the sinning,

   Chosen to save our race,

   Welcome indeed Thou art,

   Redeemer, Fount of Grace,

   To this my longng heart


   Come, self-existent Word,

   And speak Thou in my spirit!

   The soul where Thou art heard

   Doth endless peace inherit.

   Thou Light that lightenest all,

   Abide through faith in me,

   Nor let me from Thee fall,

   And seek no guide but Thee.


   Ah! what hath stirred Thy heart,

   What cry hath mounted thither,

   And reached Thy heavenly throne,

   And drawn Thee, Saviour, hither?

   It was Thy wondrous love,

   And my most utter need,

   Made Thy compassions move,

   Stronger than Death indeed.


   Then let me give my heart

   To Him who loved me, wholly;

   And live, while here I dwell,

   To show His praises solely;

   Yes, Jesus, form anew

   This stony heart of mine,

   Make it till death still true

   To Thee, for ever Thine.


   Let nought be left within

   But what Thy hand hath planted;

   Root out the weeds of sin,

   And quell the foe who haunted

   My soul, and set the tares;

   From Thee comes nothing ill,

   O save me from his snares,

   Make plain my pathway still.


   Thou art the Life, O Lord,

   And Thou its Light art only!

   Let not Thy blessed rays

   Still leave me dark and lonely.

   Star of the East, arise!

   Drive all my clouds away,

   Till earth's dim twilight dies

   Into the perfect day!

   On, still onward, mounting nigher

   On, still onward, ever higher,

   Till the mournful earth grows dim!

   God is thy Rock;

   Christ thy Champion cannot fail,

   Though thy foes thy life assail,

   Fear not their shock.


   Hide thee, in His chamber bide thee,

   Christ hath open'd now the door;

   Tell Him all that doth betide thee,

   All thy sorrows there outpour;

   He hears thy cry;

   Men may hate thee and deceive,

   Christ His own will never leave,

   He still is nigh.


   High, oh high, o'er all things earthy,

   Raise thy thoughts, my soul, to heaven;

   One alone of thee is worthy,

   All thou hast to Him be given,

   Thy Lord He is

   Who so truly pleads for thee,

   Who in love hath died for thee;

   Then thou art His.


   Up then, upwards! seek thou only

   For the things that are above;

   Sin thou hatest, earth is lonely,

   Rise to Him whom thou dost love,--

   There art thou blest;

   All things here must change and die,

   Only with our Lord on high

   Is perfect rest.

   When the fields are gay with flowers,

   As their varied hues I see,--

   What must their Creator be!


   When I wander by the stream,

   Or beside the fountain dream,

   Straight my thoughts take wing and mount

   Up to Thee, the purest Fount.


   Sweetly all the air is stirr'd

   Sun and moon and starry host,

   All things wake at Thy command,

   Held in being by Thy hand.

   And the cunning of my foe

   Hath not wrought my overthrow.

   On the mountain-summit tarries,

   And yet carries

   To pray'r awhile betake thee,

   And praise thy Maker ere thou rest.

   Now God be with us, for the night is closing;

   The light and darkness are of His disposing,

   And 'neath His shadow here to rest we yield us,

   For he will shield us.


   Let evil thoughts and spirits flee before us;

   Till morning cometh, watch, O Master, o'er us;

   In soul and body Thou from harm defend us,

   Thine angels send us.


   Let pious thoughts be ours when sleep o'ertakes us,

   Our earliest thoughts be Thine when morning wakes us;

   All day serve Thee, in all that we are doing

   Thy praise pursuing.


   As Thy beloved soothe the sick and weeping,

   And bid the captive lose his griefs in sleeping;

   Widows and orphans, we to Thee commend them,

   Do Thou befriend them.


   We have no refuge; none on earth to aid us,

   Save Thee, O Father, who Thine own hast made us;

   But Thy dear presence will not leave them lonely,

   Who seek Thee only.


   Father, Thy name be praised, Thy kingdom given,

   Thy will be done on earth as 'tis in heaven

   Keep us in life, forgive our sins, deliver

   Us now and ever.--Amen.

   Gottlob, ein Schritt zur Ewigkeit

   [524]A. H. Francke, 1691


   Oh wouldst Thou in Thy glory come,

   As Thou, Lord, hast foretold it!

   I count the moment's weary sum

   Until we may behold it;

   With burning lamp, the Church, Thy Bride,

   Is waiting for the holy tide

   When Thou, Lord, wilt unfold it.


   Yet I would leave it to thy choice,

   The hour when we shall meet Thee!

   Though Thou dost love that heart and voice

   Should daily thus entreat Thee,

   And henceforth all my course should be

   Still looking on and up to Thee,

   With heart prepared to greet Thee.


   I joy that from Thy love divine

   No power my soul can sever;

   That I may dare to call Thee mine,

   My Lord, my Friend, for ever!

   That I, O Prince of Life, shall be

   Made wholly one in heaven with Thee,

   In life that endeth never.


   And therefore do my thinks o'erflow

   That one more year is ended,

   And of this Time, so puor, so slow,

   Another step ascended;

   And with a heart that may not wait

   I hasten towards the golden gate

   Where long my hopes have tended.


   And when the wearied hands give way,

   And wearied knees are failing,

   Then make Thy mighty arm my stay,

   Though faith and hope seem quailing;

   That so my heart drink in new strength,

   And fear no more the journey's length,

   O'er doubt and pain prevailing.


   Then on, my soul, with fearless faith,

   Let nought to terror move thee,

   Nor list what earthly pleasure saith,

   When she would lure and prove thee;

   The eagles' wings of love and prayer

   Will bear thee through life's toil and care

   To Him who still doth love thee.

   Awake, awake, all ye that sleep,

   Ere yet ye be o'ertaken

   May hope and fear no ill,

   The Peace that now He giveth

   Hath deeper meaning still,

   For He will surely teach us this:

   To cast my soul on Christ her Friend,

   Nor spare repentant cries and tears;

   ||:My God,:|| for Jesu's sake I pray

   Thy peace may bless my dying day.


   And let me now so order all,

   That ever ready I may be

   To say with joy, whate'er befall,

   Lord, do Thou as Thou wilt with me;

   ||:My God,:|| for Jesu's sake I pray

   Thy peace may bless my dying day.


   Let heaven to me be ever sweet,

   And this world bitter let me find,

   That I, 'mid all its toil and heat,

   May keep eternity in mind;

   ||:My God,:|| for Jesu's sake I pray

   Thy peace may bless my dying day.


   O Father, cover all my sins

   With Jesu's merits, who alone

   The pardon that I covet wins,

   And makes His long-sought rest my own;

   ||:My God,:|| for Jesu's sake I pray

   Thy peace may bless my dying day.


   His sorrows and His cross I know

   Make death-beds soft, and light the grave,

   They comfort in the hour of woe,

   They give me all I fain would have;

   ||:My God,:|| for Jesu's sake I pray

   Thy peace may bless my dying day.


   From Him can nought my soul divide,

   Nor life nor death can part us now;

   I lay my hand upon His side,

   And say, My Lord and God art Thou;

   ||:My God,:|| for Jesu's sake I pray

   Thy peace may bless my dying day.


   In holy baptism long ago,

   I join'd me to the living Vine,

   Thou lovest me in Him, I know,

   In Him Thou dost accept me Thine;

   ||:My God,:|| for Jesu's sake I pray

   Thy peace may bless my dying day.


   And I have eaten of His flesh

   And drunk His blood,--nor can I be

   Forsaken now, nor doubt afresh,

   I am in Him and He in me;

   ||:My God,:|| for Jesu's sake I pray

   Thy peace may bless my dying day.


   Then death may come or tarry yet,

   I know in Christ I perish not,

   He never will His own forget,

   He gives me robes without a spot;

   ||:My God,:|| for Jesu's sake I pray

   Thy peace may bless my dying day.


   And thus I live in God at peace,

   And die without a thought of fear,

   Content to take what God decrees,

   For through His Son my faith is clear,

   ||:His grace:|| shall be in death my stay,

   And peace shall bless my dying day.

   Geht nun hin und grabt mein Grab

   Geht und hin und grabt mein Grab

   [575]Ernst Moritz Arndt, 1819


   Go and dig my grave today!

   Weary of my ceaseless roaming,

   Now from earth I pass away,

   Heav'nly peace awaits my coming,

   Angel voices from above

   Call me to their rest and love.


   Go and dig my grave today!

   Homeward now my journey tendeth,

   And I lay my staff away

   Here where all earth's labour endeth,

   And I lay my weary head

   In the only painless bed.


   What is there I yet should do

   If in this dark vale I linger?

   Proud our schemes, and fair to view,

   Yet they melt beneath Time's finger

   Like the sand before the wind,

   That no power of man can bind.


   Farewell, earth, then! I am glad

   That I now in peace may leave thee,

   For thy very joys are sad,

   And thy hopes do but deceive thee;

   Fleeting is thy beauty's gleam,

   False and changing as a dream.


   Sun and moon and stars so bright,

   Farewell all your golden splendour!

   Here I loved you, but your light

   Gladly will I now surrender,

   For the glories of that day

   Where ye all must fade away.


   Farewell, O ye friends I love!

   Though awhile ye journey grieving,

   Comfort cometh from above

   To the hearts in Christ believing;

   Weep not o'er a passing show,

   To th' eternal world I go.


   Weep not that the world I leave,

   Mourn not that I am exchanging

   Errors that here closely cleave,

   Empty ghosts and shadows ranging

   Through this world of nought and night,

   For a land of truth and light.


   Weep not! dearest to my heart

   Is my Saviour, He doth cheer me;

   And I know that I have part

   In his pains, and He is near me;

   For He shed His precious blood

   For the whole world's highest good.


   Weep not, my Redeemer lives!

   From the dust, Hope ever vernal

   Looks to Heaven and upward strives;

   Fearless Faith and Love eternal

   Now are softly whispering nigh,

   "Child of God, fear not to die!"

   O Welt, ich muss dich lassen

   [577]J. Hesse, before 1547


   O world, I now must leave thee,

   But little doth it grieve me,

   I seek my native land;

   True life I there inherit,

   And here I yield my spirit

   With joy to God's all-gracious hand.


   So on His Word relying,

   I know while I am dying

   I seen shall see His face

   Through Christ whose death hath bought me,

   The Father's love He brought me,

   And now prepares for me a place.


   The grave hath lost its terrors

   Since for my sins and errors

   My Saviour doth atone:

   My works can nought avail me,

   But His work cannot fail me,

   I rest in faith on Him alone.


   My service cannot merit

   That I should e'er inherit

   Eternal life with Christ:

   But He hath freely given

   A share with Him in heaven

   Of that fair heritage unpriced.


   And so I hence am going

   In peace, full surely knowing

   With Him is perfet rest;

   I feel Death's icy finger,

   My soul here cannot linger,

   Now would I stay--to go is best.


   O world, I yet would teach thee

   That Death will surely reach thee,

   That thou must follow me;

   Then while thy days are lengthen'd

   Pray that thy faith be strengthen'd

   That God have mercy too on thee!

   Herr Jesu Christ mein Lebens Licht

   O Jesu Christ, mein's Lebens Licht

   [579]M. Behemb, 1606


   Lord Jesus Christ, my Life, my Light,

   My strength by day, my trust by night,

   On earth I'm but a passing guest,

   And sorely with my sins oppress'd.


   Far off I see my fatherland,

   Where through Thy grace I hope to stand,

   But ere I reach that Paradise

   A weary way before me lies.


   My heart sinks at the journey's length,

   My wasted flesh has little strength,

   Only my soul still cries in me,

   Lord, fetch me home, take me to Thee!


   Oh let Thy sufferings give me power

   To meet the last and darkest hour;

   Thy cross the staff whereon I lean,

   My couch the grave where Thou hast been.


   Since Thou hast died, the Pure, the Just,

   I take my homeward way in trust,

   The gates of heaven, Lord, open wide,

   When here I may no more abide.


   And when the last great Day is come,

   And Thou our Judge shalt speak the doom,

   Let me with joy behold the light,

   And set me then upon Thy right.


   Renew this wasted flesh of mine,

   That like the sun it there may shine,

   Among the angels pure and bright,

   Yea, like Thyself in glorious light.


   Ah then I have my heart's desire,

   When singing with the angels' choir,

   Among the ransom'd of Thy grace,

   For ever I behold Thy face!

   Oh help me in my utter woe,

   Thine ear to me in pity bow;

   When hence my soul must quickly go,

   Receive her, as her God and Friend,

   For all is right if right the end.


   Now, O my Lord, I follow Thee,

   Safe where Thy steps I plainly trace;

   Ah, now Thou art not far from me,

   Though Death is with me face to face,

   And I must leave the friends most dear

   Who loved me well and truly here.


   The body calmly sleeps in earth,

   To Thee the spirit spreads her wings,

   And in Thy hands, a second birth

   She finds in death, to life she springs;

   Here was a land of tears and woe,

   Where toil and care are all we know.


   Now Death and Satan, hell and sin,

   And this world, all have lost their power,

   The grace and hope Thou, Lord, didst win

   For me, uphold me in this hour;

   For on the Son my debts were laid,

   And He my ransom freely paid.


   Why mourn, then, that I now go hence?

   Surely a blessed lot is mine;

   Clothed in His spotless innocence,

   Before Him as a bride I shine;

   Farewell, thou evil world, farewell!

   With God I rather choose to dwell.

   I will remember Thou didst die,

   Will think on Thy most bitter cry,

   Thou art in heaven--this soothes my pain,

   To Thee I now stretch out mine arms,

   Jerusalem, thou city fair and high,

   Would God I were in thee!

   My longing heart fain, fain to thee would fly,

   It will not stay with me;

   Far over vale and mountain,

   Far over field and plain,

   It hastes to seek its Fountain

   And quit this world of pain.


   Oh happy day, and yet far happier hour,

   When wilt thou come at last?

   When fearless to my Father's love and power,

   Whose promise standeth fast,

   My soul I gladly render,

   For surely will His hand

   Lead her with guidance tender

   To heaven her fatherland.


   A moment's space, and gently, wondrously,

   Released from earthly ties,

   The fiery car shall bear her up to thee

   Through all these lower skies,

   To yonder shining regions,

   While down to meet her come

   The blessed angel legions,

   And bid her welcome home.


   Oh Zoin, hail! Bright city, now unfold

   The gates of grace to me!

   How many a time I long'd for thee of old,

   Ere yet I was set free

   From yon dark life of sadness,

   Yon world of shadowy nought,

   And God had given the gladness,

   The heritage I sought.


   Oh what the tribe, or what the glorious host,

   Comes sweeping swiftly down?

   The chosen ones on earth who wrought the most,

   The Church's brightest crown,

   Our Lord hath sent to meet me,

   As in the far-off years

   Their words oft came to greet me

   In yonder land of tears.


   The Patriarchs' and Prophets' noble train,

   With all Christ's followers true,

   Who bore the cross, and could the worst disdain

   That tyrants dared to do,

   I see them shine for ever,

   All-glorious as the sun,

   'Mid light that fadeth never,

   Their perfect freedom won.


   And when within that lovely Paradise

   At last I safely dwell,

   From out my blissful soul what songs shall rise,

   What joy my lips shall tell,

   While holy saints are singing

   Hosannas o'er and o'er,

   Pure Hallelujahs ringing

   Around me evermore.


   Innumerous choirs before the shining throne

   Their joyful anthems raise,

   Till Heaven's glad halls are echoing with the tone

   Of that great hymn of praise,

   And all its host rejoices,

   And all its blessed throng

   Unite their myriad voices

   To a better life ye pass,

   And this body form'd of clay,

   Here must languish and decay,

   Ere it rise in glorious might,

   Fit to dwell with saints in light.


   Therefore, since my God doth choose it,

   Willingly I yield my life,

   Nor I grieve that I should lose it,

   For with sorrows it was rife;

   And my Saviour suffer'd here

   That I might not faint nor fear,

   Since for me He bore my load

   And hath trod the same dark road.


   For my sake He went before me,

   And His death is now my gain;

   Peace and hope He conquer'd for me,

   So without regret or pain

   To His lovely home I go,

   From this land of toil and woe,

   Glad to reach that blest abode

   Where I shall behold my God.


   There is joy beyond our telling

   Where so many saints are gone;

   Thousand thousands there are dwelling,

   Worshipping before the throne,

   There the seraphim on high

   Brightly shine, and ever cry

   "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord!

   There in One for aye adored!"


   O Jerusalem, how clearly

   Dost Thou shine, Thou city fair!

   Lo! I hear the tones more nearly,

   Ever sweetly sounding there!

   Oh what peace and joy hast thou!

   Lo the Sun is rising now,

   And the breaking day I see

   That shall never end for me!


   Yea, I see what here was told me,

   See that wondrous glory shine,

   Feel the spotless robes enfold me,

   Know a golden crown is mine;

   So before the throne I stand

   One amid that glorious band,

   Gazing on that joy for aye

   That shall never pass away!

   O world, I now must leave thee,

   But little doth it grieve me,

   I seek my native land;

   True life I there inherit,

   And here I yield my spirit

   With joy to God's all-gracious hand.

   Johann Crüger's tune to "Schmücke dich, O liebe Seele," as it appears,
   both in melody and harmony, in his "Geistliche Kirchenmelodien.
   Leipzig, 1649.


   Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness,

   Leave the gloomy haunts of sadness,

   Come into the daylight's splendour,

   There with joy thy praises render

   Unto Him whose grace unbounded

   Hath this wondrous banquet founded;

   High o'er all the heav'ns he reigneth,

   Yet to dwell with thee He deigneth!

   Goudimel's Melody to Psalm xlii, "Comme en void un cerf qui brâme,"
   known in Germany under the title "," as it is found, both in melody and
   harmony, in Samuel Marshall's edition of the Whole Book of Psalms.
   Basle, 1594. [17]


   O my soul, be glad and cheerful,

   Now forget thy misery;

   From this earth so dark and tearful,

   Christ the Lord is calling thee.

   Out of sorrows, fears, and woe,

   To that joy thou now shalt go;

   Which our thought may picture never,

   But we know it lasts for ever.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [17] In this reprint of Goudimel's Psalmody (French) 1565, the melody
   is, for the first time, given to the highest voice. In Goudimel's
   original work the melody is entrusted to the tenor, as was customary in
   his time.

IV.

   Hans Leo Hassler's tune, "Herzlich thut mich verlangen," as it appears,
   both in melody in harmony, in J. H. Schein's Cantional, 1627. [18]


   My heart is fill'd with longing

   To pass away in peace;

   For woes are round me, thronging,

   And trials will not cease.

   Oh fain would I be hasting

   From thee, dark world of gloom,

   To gladness everlasting;

   O Jesus! quickly come!
     __________________________________________________________________

   [18] The harmonies, as printed here for four voices, are from Schein's
   "Cantional," and are a reduction from the Composer's original score of
   five voices, as published by him in 1601 to the words "."

V.

   Psalm cxxxiv. (In England called the Old 100th). The Melody is given
   below, as it is found on its first appearance (withoud harmonies) in
   the work: "Les Pseaumes mis en rime Française par Cl. Marot et Theodor
   de Bèze; à Lyon par Jan de Tourmes pour Antoine Fincent, MDLXIII." [19]
   (Preface dated Geneval, June 10, 1543.)

   PSEAUME CXXXIIII.--Th. de BE (Theo. de Beza).
   Sheet Music

   Subsequently this tune (as above, without any alteration) appears to
   "Psalm C. Jubilate Deo, J. H." in Sternhold and Hopkins' edition of the
   Whole Book of Psalms, London, 1604, and later in Ravenscroft's "Whole
   Booke of Psalmes, London, 1621;" set for four parts, once on the words
   of the 100th Psalm, and a second time to harmonies by Ravenscroft, as
   given below. The melody is assigned to the Tenor, as was usually done
   at that period.

VI.

   Luther's tune and hymns, "," as it appears for the first time in Johann
   Walter's "Geistliche Gesangbüchlein." Wittemberg, 1524. The harmonies
   are taken from the tune book published by command of the "Eisenach
   Kirchenconferenz," by G. v. Tucher and others (Stuttgart, 1854), and
   are probably selected from old editions.

   This hymn and tune was intended by Luther to be sung as the Creed
   during the morning service, and remained in use as such for a long
   time. Though omitted by the Editors in the body of this work, being
   considered by them unsuitable for England, they have inserted it here
   as an interesting specimen of hymnology.
   Sheet Music


   We all believe in One true God,

   Maker of the earth and heaven;

   The Father, who to us in love

   Hath the claim of children given.

   He in soul and body feeds us,

   All we want His hand provides us;

   Thro' all snares and perils leads us,

   Watches that no harm betides us;

   He cares for us,

   Cares for us by day and night,

   All things are govern'd by His might.


   And we believe in Jesus Christ,

   His Only Son, our Lord, possessing

   An equal Godhead, throne and might,

   Through whom descends the Father's blessing;

   Conceivèd of the Holy Spirit,

   Born of Mary, virgin mother;

   That lost man might inherit

   Made true man, our Elder Brother,

   Was crucified bor sinful men,

   And raised by God to life again.


   And we confess the Holy Ghost,

   Who from Son and Father floweth,

   The Comforter of fearful hearts,

   Who all precious gifts bestoweth;

   In whome all the Church hath union,

   Who maintains the Saints' Communion;

   We believe our sins forgiven,

   And that life with God in heaven,

   When we are raised again, shall be

   Our portion in eternity.

  OPINIONS OF THE PRESS

   "We might seem extravagent to some were we to express our full sense of
   the piety, poetry, and music of this most charming volume of sacred
   verse and harmony. All the hymns have considerable merit (which can be
   said perhaps of no other collection). Some of them are most touching,
   especially when well sung: but they need to be well sung. They need a
   degree of executive skill which will not be found in parish churches as
   a rule. It is a book, in a word, for which all hymn-lovers must be
   grateful: it must tend powerfully to refine the taste of the Christian
   public where it is known. Most of the hymns, although translations,
   read with all the freshness of originals."

   LITERARY CHURCHMAN.

   "Of the Chorale Book as a whole we may speak most favourably. From the
   hands of such musical editors nothing that could offend the most
   critical could be expected to appear. . . . . Many of the tunes are as
   beautiful as they are new to the English ear. They are all derived from
   the German sources, though the origin of many, dating before the
   Reformation, is European rather than locally national. The variety of
   their metres is welcome, after the uniform stiffness to which we are
   accustomed in England. Two-thirds of the hymns themselves are familiar
   to us from their appearance in Miss Winkworth's Lyra Germanica; those
   which have been added are translated by the same accomplished pen, and
   are characterized by the same merits. . . . . Dr. Bennett and Mr.
   Goldschmidt have done good service by undertaking this compilation; and
   we can honestly recommend it to every choir that loves sound and
   sterling music."

   SATURDAY REVIEW.

   "The editors have, in many cases, retained the harmonies of the authors
   of the tunes, and in general have striven to preserve, as far as
   possible, the character belonging to the period of their composition:
   thus, the melodies of the sixteenth and eighteenth century called for
   different styles of harmony, clearly indicated by their different flow
   in respect of distances. The editors say that they have in all cases
   endeavoured to combine solemnity with simplicity, and to give harmonies
   which, though offering no difficulty in execution, should yet approach
   the strength and purity peculiar to the best Church music of all times.
   . . . . The Chorale Book is really a beautiful and highly valuable
   work, and it will be found to administer admirably to musical taste
   when directed to holy and devout themes."

   CLERICAL JOURNAL.

   "It is gratifying to find two such distinguished musicians as Professor
   Sterndale Bennett and Mr. Otto Goldschmidt co-operating in a work which
   deserves to take high rank as a standard collection of Church tunes,
   admirable alike in selection and arrangement. . . . It is with much
   satisfaction that we welcome the appearance of the Chorale Book, as a
   collection of some of the grandest and purest old tunes associated with
   religious purposes. . . . . . This work, viewed in its musical aspect,
   is likely to cause a healthy reaction in English Psalmody."

   LONDON REVIEW.

   The names of the editors of this book are a sufficient guarantee for
   the value of its contents. Professor Bennett is well known to have
   devoted much of his attention to the old German school of sacred music,
   and the English public are mainly indebted to his exertions for such
   knowledge as they possess of the most illustrious masters of that
   school. Mr. Otto Goldschmidt is one of the most learned and
   accomplished German musicians of our time, and a fitting coadjutor with
   Professor Bennett in such a work as the present. . . . . . The volume
   contains many of the finest German, French, and Flemish tunes. The
   harmonies are excellent, and the entire volume is of great value. . . .
   . In regard to the harmonisation, the editors have endeavoured to
   combine solemnity with simplicity, and to give harmonies which, though
   offering no difficulty in execution, should yet approach the strength
   and purity peculiar to the best church music of all times. In the
   execution of this task they have availed themselves of the labours of
   Sebastian Bach; and their Chorale Book contains a body of
   ecclesiastical harmony which, in antique and venerable grandeur, plain
   and simple style, freedom from chromatic crudities, and fitness to be
   sung by large numbers of voices, is unequalled by any work of this
   class that has ever appeared in England."

   DAILY NEWS.

   "The general arrangement of this book carries with it tokens of an
   amount of diligent research which, in connexion with the musical
   learning of its editors, would make it an impertinence for any one not
   specially devoted to the archaeology of German sacred music to
   criticise the selection. . . . . The arrangements of the tunes are
   worthy of all praise. The harmony is essentially vocal. It is quite a
   luxury to follow even with the eye the bold, free movement of the parts
   which distinguishes every page of the book, contrasting so pleasantly
   with the prevalent or lately prevalent style of hymn-book harmony. . .
   . . The independent melodic treatment of each part is preserved,
   tenfold interest being thereby given to the work of each individual
   singer. The universal use of keyed instruments has somewhat dulled the
   popular perception of the beauty of vocal harmony; and a
   piano-forte-player falls insensible into the habit of regarding harmony
   as a succession of chords. These chorales are just the thing to
   counteract this tendency. They should be sung, not played. They are
   essentially vocal music. So treated, this collection will be, all
   association apart, a source of delight to all part-singers who can
   enjoy real harmony in its purest forms."

   Wann der Herr einst die Gefangenen, [1383]h199-p2.1, [1384]h199-p3.1

   Warum betrübst du dich, mein Herz, [1385]h143-p3.1

   Warum willst du drauszen stehen, [1386]h153-p3.1

   Was Gott thut das ist wohlgetan, [1387]h135-p3.1

   Welt, ade, ich bin dein müde, [1394]h198-p3.2

   Welt, lebwohl, ich bin dein müde, [1395]h198-p3.1

   Wenn ich in Angst und Noth, [1396]h142-p3.1

   Wenn mein Stündlein vorhanden ist, [1397]h193-p2.1

   Wenn meine Sünd' mich kränken, [1398]h048-p3.1

   Wenn wir in höchsten Nöthen sein, [1399]h141-p2.1

   Wer Gott vertraut hat wohlgebaut, [1400]h145-p3.1

   Wer im Herzen will erfahren, [1401]h039-p3.1

   Wer nur den lieben Gott lässt walten, [1402]h134-p3.1

   Wer sind die vor Gottes Throne, [1403]h077-p3.1

   Wer weiss, wie nahe mir mein Ende, [1404]h187-p3.1

   Werde Licht, du Stadt der Heiden, [1405]h038-p3.1

   Werde munter, mein Gemüthe, [1406]h167-p3.1

   What shall I, a sinner, do?, [1407]h110-p2.47

   What within me and without, [1408]h139-p2.86

   Whate'er my God ordains is right, [1409]h135-p2.50

   When anguish'd and perplex'd I lift my weary eyes, [1410]h142-p2.30

   When in the hour of utmost need, [1411]h141-p1.42

   When my last hour is close at hand, [1412]h193-p1.46

   When o'er my sins I sorrow, [1413]h048-p2.45

   When on the cross the Saviour hung, [1414]h053-p2.65

   When the Lord recalls the banish'd, [1415]h199-p1.7, [1416]h199-p2.4

   Wherefore dost Thou longer tarry, [1417]h153-p2.59

   While yet the morn is breaking, [1418]h163-p2.41

   Who are those that, fare before me, [1419]h077-p2.54

   Who knows how near my end may be?, [1420]h187-p2.5, [1421]h187-p3.2

   Who puts his trust in God most just, [1422]h145-p2.33

   Why art thou thus cast down, my heart?, [1423]h143-p2.59

   Wie ein Vogel lieblich singet, [1424]h161-p3.1

   Wie herrlich strahlt der Morgenstern, [1425]h036-p3.1

   Wie könnt' ich Sein vergessen, [1426]h095-p3.1
