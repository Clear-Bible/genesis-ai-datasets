   Cantitum canticorum spiritualis quaedam sanctarum est voluptas
   mentium, in conjugio illius regis & reginae civiitatis, quod est
   Christus &
   ecclesia; sed haec voluptas allegoricis tegminibus involuta est, ut
   desideretur ardentius, nudeturque jucundius, & appareat sponsus, cui
   dicitur in codem cantico, aequitas dilexit te, & sponsa quae ibi audit,
   charitas in deliciis tuis. AUG. de Civ. Dei, 1. 17. c. 20.

   Preface
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word following Exposition was delivered in one hundred and
   twenty-two Sermons, to the Congregation where God his providence has
   placed me, and were designed only for their use, profit, and education.
   Had I had any thoughts of publishing it to the world when I entered
   upon it, perhaps it might have appeared with some little more advantage
   than now it does; nor had it appeared now, had not the importunity of
   the people to whom I minister, with others, obliged me to it; to which
   I the more readily complied, considering that the authority and
   usefulness of this book are called in question in this loose and
   degenerate age; in which, not only this, but all scripture is ridiculed
   and burlesqued, and the great doctrines of faith therein contained
   treated with the utmost sneer and contempt; and therefore would
   willingly contribute all I can towards the vindicating of this, or any
   other part of the sacred writings; which, being given by inspiration of
   God, are "profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for
   instruction in righteousness."

   I have in the performance of this work, consulted the original text,
   with the versions of several learned men; and have taken notice of them
   where they have differed from our translation, or have furnished out a
   proper and useful observation. I have also inspected several
   interpreters upon this book, both Jewish and Christian, and have
   collected their several senses together; and generally, if not always,
   have humbly given my opinion which is the most eligible. The versions
   which I have made use of, are those of the Septuagint, the Vulgate
   Latin, the Tigurine, Junius and Tremellius, Arias Montanus, Pagninus,
   etc. The writings and interpreters which I have consulted, of the
   Jewish, are Shirhashirim Rabba, Targum, Jarchi, Aben Ezra, Alshech and
   Yalcut Simeoni, together with the books of Zohar and Rabboth, which are
   interspersed with the senses of various passages in this book. Of
   Christian interpreters, Alcuin, Foliot, Mercerus, Cocceius, Sanctius,
   Ainsworth, Brightman, Cotton, Durham, Patrick, etc. from all which I
   have received profit and advantage; and from none more than from the
   short notes of the incomparable Ainsworth, and the sweet observations
   of the excellent Durham: I mention these authors, not by way of
   ostentation, but as in duty bound to acknowledge by whom I have
   profited; for, as Pliny says, [1] Est benignum et plenum ingenui
   pudoris, fateri per quos profeceris. Where two or more senses of any
   passage have offered agreeable to the analogy of faith, I have
   considered them all, and have made what improvement of them I was
   capable of, leaving the reader to judge for himself, which of them is
   most preferable; this I thought to be a much better way than to be too
   positive and dogmatical in the sense of a text, especially in such a
   part of scripture, which is so very mystical and abstruse. If I should
   be thought in any part of this work to have stretched the metaphors too
   far, I hope it will be imputed to an honest zeal, and a hearty desire
   to set forth the glory of Christ's person; and his exceeding great love
   to his church and people; to do which, all tropes and figures, all the
   flowers of rhetoric fall abundantly short. I have been obliged to
   contract what I delivered sermon-wise, lest the work should swell to
   too large a bulk, but the substance of it is here contained.

   I would only observe, as to this edition [2] of the work, that I have
   made various additions to it; having, since the publication of the
   second edition, met with an objection or two to the antiquity and
   authority of the book itself, I thought it necessary to consider them,
   and remove them; being unwilling that any thing should lie against a
   book so grand, so sacred and useful. I have also given a summary of the
   contents of each chapter, which was wanting in the former editions: and
   though I had in many parts of the work, attended to the literal sense
   of passages, yet not so frequently as I have in my shorter notes on
   this book-published in my Exposition of the whole Bible: I have
   therefore inserted from thence many things relating to the literal
   sense, with many others added, which will greatly enrich this edition,
   and make it more entertaining; and will greatly serve to shew the
   propriety of the allusions, figures, and metaphors made use of
   throughout the whole; and to illustrate and confirm the spiritual
   meaning of this sublime and mysterious book. I have left out at the end
   of it, the Targum or Chaldee paraphrase, with my notes thereon, which
   were in the former editions, they being of little use and benefit;
   especially to common readers.

   Chapter 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   In this chapter, after the general title of the book, verse 1, the
   church expresses her strong desires and most ardent wishes for some
   fresh discoveries of the love of Christ to her, and for communion with
   him, verse 2, and having tasted of his love, and smelled a sweet savor
   in his grace, and enjoyed fellowship with him in his house, verses 3,
   4, she observes her blackness and uncomeliness in herself, and
   comeliness in him, the trials and afflictions she met with from others,
   and her carelessness and negligence of her own affairs, verse 5, 6, and
   entreats her beloved to direct her, where she might meet with him
   feeding his flocks and giving them rest; to which he returns a kind and
   gracious answer, and gives proper instructions where to find him,
   verses 7, 8, and then commends her beauty, sets forth her amiableness
   and loveliness by various metaphors, and makes promises of more grace
   and good things to her, verses 9, 10, 11, when she declares what a
   value she had for Christ her beloved; and how precious he was unto her,
   like a bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphor, verses 12, 13, 14,
   and Christ again praises her beauty, and particularly takes notice of
   her eyes, and her modest look, verse 15, and she returns the encomium
   back to him, and expresses her pleasure and satisfaction in the house
   he had built for her, and the furniture of it, verses 16, 17.

Chapter 1 Verse 1

   The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word by the assistance of God, to open and explain this
   mysterious part of the sacred writings, it will be proper,

   I.To enquire into, and establish the authority of this book.

   II.Shew the nature of it; it being a Song.

   III.The excellency of it. it being called the Song of Songs

   IV.The penman of it; which is Solomon.

   I.I shall endeavor to prove the divine authority of this book, and
   vindicate it from those exceptions which are made against it: and,

   1st, It was always received by the ancient Jews, to whom the oracles of
   God were committed, as a very valuable part of the sacred writings; and
   has been continued in the canon of the scriptures by the Christians in
   all ages to this very day The Jews had always a very venerable esteem
   of it, calling it, the holy of holies; forbidding their children the
   reading thereof, as well as the first chapter of Genesis, and the
   beginning and end of the prophecy of Ezekiel, until they were of thirty
   years of age, [3] because of the mysteriousness and sublimity of it.
   They say, [4] that Solomon when he was old and near death, the Holy
   Ghost dwelt upon him, and he composed the books of Proverbs, Song of
   Songs, and Ecclesiastes. Their ancient book of Zohar [5] asserts, that
   Solomon composed it "by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit;" as does
   also the Targum upon this book, and R. Solomon Jarchi, and R. Alben
   Ezra, in their prefaces to their commentaries upon it; the latter of
   which has these words; "God forbid, God forbid, says he, that the Song
   of songs should be written or understood of things obscene; but it is
   entirely parabolical, and had it not been of very great excellency, it
   had not been written in the catalogue of the holy scriptures; for of it
   there has been no controversy, that it defiles the hands:" [6] for
   though there was once a controversy [7] among the wise men concerning
   the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, who afterwards, as it became
   them, changed their minds; yet there never was any concerning this, as
   appears from their Mirnah; where they say [8] that "all the scriptures
   are holy, but the Song of songs is the holy of holies; and if the wise
   men have had any controversy, it has been only concerning
   Ecclesiastes:" so that this book appears to be authentic, according to
   the mind of the ancient as well as of the modern Jews; and as for the
   Christians, they have always looked upon it as a part of the holy
   scripture, a few only excepted, and have all along continued it in the
   canon as they found and received it. The ancient fathers and councils
   have always esteemed it sacred and venerable, not to take notice of
   authorities of a later date. The opinion of Theodorus of Mopsuest, who
   called the divine authority of this book into question, was condemned
   in the second council of Constantinople, which was held about the year
   553. This book also appears in the catalogue of the canonical books of
   scripture, established in the council of Laodicea, Can. 59. held about
   the year 364. It is likewise in Origen's catalogue, recorded by
   Eusebius, [9] as well as in that which Melito [10] brought from the
   East, and sent to his friend Onesimus, who flourished about the year
   140. So that thus far, at least, we can trace up the authority of this
   book among the Christians: Not to take notice of the canons of the
   Apostles, in which it stands as a part of canonical scripture: nor the
   Constitutions of the Apostles with the larger epistles of Ignatius, in
   which citations are made from this book; which, if genuine, would prove
   the reception of it in the Christian church still more early; but
   because they are generally looked upon to be spurious, they are not to
   be insisted on. And it may be farther observed, that not only Origen,
   but Hippolytus in the third century, [11] Carpathius, Gregory Nyssene
   in the fourth, and Theodoret in the fifth, and others in the following
   centuries, wrote commentaries upon this book; and Eusebius [12]
   ascribes it to Solomon, and so does Athanasius. [13]

   2dly, This book was wrote by one that was qeopneusov, divinely
   inspired; as appears by his being the penman of the books of Proverbs
   and Ecclesiastes; for why he should not be under the inspiration of the
   same Spirit in writing this, as he was in writing those, there appears
   no reason to conclude. The objection against it, taken from his great
   fall into lewdness and idolatry, produced by a late author, [14] avails
   but little; especially, if, as some think, it should appear that it was
   written before; or if, with others, it is taken to be wrote after his
   fall, it will lie as strongly against the book of Ecclesiastes, which
   is generally allowed to be wrote after, as it does against this:
   Besides, it has pleased the all-wise God, who gives no account of his
   matters to his creatures, to make use of men, after very great falls
   into sin, as Amanuenses of his Holy Spirit, and penmen of the sacred
   scriptures, as David and Peter.

   3dly, The dignity and sublimity of the matter contained herein, shew it
   to be no human composure; for never man spake or wrote like unto it; it
   is therefore called the Song of songs, being the most excellent of
   Songs; which cannot be equaled by any, but surpasses all others, not
   only human but divine; it is preferred to all scriptural songs, which,
   as one [15] observes, would be blasphemous to do, was it not of a
   divine rise and authority.

   4thly, The majesty of its style bears a testimony to the divine
   original of it, which cannot be equaled by the most elaborate
   performances; it defies all the art and wisdom of man to come near it;
   and plainly shews itself to be the language of God himself, whose voice
   is powerful and full of majesty.

   5thly, The power and efficacy which it has in and over the hearts of
   men, is another evidence of its being the word of God; which is quick
   and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to
   the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow,
   and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. This book
   has been profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
   instruction in righteousness; which are so many arguments of its being
   given by inspiration of God; it effectually works in them that believe;
   it has been useful to thousands who have had their spiritual senses
   exercised, for the comfort of their souls, the raising of their
   affections, the increase of their faith, and their instruction in
   divine things: the reading and expounding of this excellent portion of
   scripture have been owned by God for the good of multitudes, who are so
   many sealing evidences of the authority of it.

   6thly, The impartiality of it is another evidence of its divine
   original: the bride is here frequently introduced proclaiming her own
   weaknesses and infirmities, as in chapter 1:5, 6. and 3:1. and 5:2, 3.
   Now was it a mere human composure of Solomon's, celebrating the amours
   between him and Pharaoh's daughter, would it be reasonable to suppose,
   that he should so manifestly and openly declare the defects and
   imperfections of his bride? But to consider it as a divine poem,
   expressing the mutual love between Christ and his church, it agrees
   very well with the other parts of the sacred writings, wherein the
   infirmities of God's own people are not concealed; not even of those
   who were themselves the penmen of them; which is a strong proof of
   their divine authority.

   7thly, There is a very great agreement between this and other portions
   of scripture. Now this has been always looked upon as a considerable
   evidence of the authority of the sacred writings, that though they have
   been delivered at sundry times, and in divers manners, yet there has
   been always an entire harmony between them; the which also appears in
   this part of scripture; for though it is delivered in a mysterious and
   figurative style, yet it admits of senses which are very agreeable to
   the proportion or analogy of faith; nay, in many places of the New
   Testament, there seems to be manifest allusions to this song, as will
   be hereafter more particularly observed: but notwithstanding all these
   evidences of its divine original, there have not been wanting persons
   who have called in question its sacred authority; as Theodorus of
   Mopsuest, whose opinion was, that it was not wrote by inspiration, but
   was only designed by Solomon to celebrate his amours between him and
   Pharaoh's daughter; which opinion of his was condemned in the sixth
   century by the second council of Constantinople, as has been before
   observed: Castalio in the sixteenth century was condemned for the same
   opinion, by the senate of Geneva, and was ordered to depart the city
   upon it: Grotius in the last century seemed to be much of the same
   mind; and Mr. Whiston in this has attempted in a set tract to weaken
   the authority of it, and make it appear to be a loose, profane and
   amorous song: His proposition is this; "The book of Canticles is not a
   sacred book of the Old Testament; nor was it originally esteemed as
   such, either by the Jewish or Christian church;" with what truth this
   is asserted, will in some measure appear from what has been already
   said. The arguments by which he endeavors to confirm and establish this
   proposition, are as follow, which I shall particularly consider.

   1. Because as he asserts, "It was not written in his younger days, or
   when he was the good, the wise, the chaste, and the religious man; but
   long afterwards, when he was become wicked and foolish, and lascivious,
   and idolatrous." And he affirms, that there are some very plain and
   particular chronological characters in this book, which determine it to
   belong to the latter and worser part of his life, and to that only.
   And,

   The first passage in it, which he mentions to confirm this, is Song of
   Solomon 1:9. where the church is compared to a company of horses in
   Pharaoh's chariots; which he imagines refers to those horses and
   chariots which Solomon, contrary to an express command, Deuteronomy
   17:16 had brought unto him out of Egypt, 1 Kings 10:28, 29 when he
   began to degenerate from his former piety: In answer to which, it may
   be replied, that the comparison in the text under consideration, is not
   made to a company of horses brought out of Egypt, which ran in
   Solomon's chariots; but to a company of horses in Egypt, which ran in
   Pharaoh's chariots; so that this text falls very much short of proving
   what it is produced for.

   His other chronological evidence of this book's belonging to the loose
   and vicious part of Solomon's life, is Song of Solomon 7:12. where
   mention is made of the chariots of Amminadib; in which he supposes
   there are more proofs than one of what he contends for; the first is,
   that here are chariots referred to, as used in Judea, which, he says,
   we only meet with once before, since the days of Moses, namely, 2
   Samuel 8:4 though that appears to be a mistake; for Absalom prepared
   himself chariots and horsemen, 2 Samuel 15:1 as did also Adonijah, 1
   Kings 1:5 both which were before Solomon's accession to the throne. His
   other proof from this text is, that this Amminadib was one of the
   twelve rulers of provinces, who married Taphath the daughter of
   Solomon, 1 Kings 4:11 and therefore he concludes that Solomon could not
   be a very young man when he wrote this book. To which I answer,

   1st, That it is not Amminadib but Abinadab, that is there mentioned.

   2dly, That it was not Abinadab, but the son of Abinadab, that married
   Solomon's daughter.

   3dly, It is not likely that King Solomon's son-in-law should be a
   chariot driver, as this Amminadib is thought to be by many
   interpreters, who was famous for his skill, courage, and swiftness in
   driving.

   4thly, This is not the proper name of any person, but are two words, as
   R. Aben Ezra, and R. Solomon Jarchi observe, and should be rendered,
   the chariots of my free or princely people; and therefore afford no
   chronological character of any part of Solomon's life whatever.

   The last chronological evidence he mentions, page 10, and which he
   takes to be the principal and most evident one, which shews in what
   particular time of Solomon's life this book was written, is chapter
   6:8, 9 where mention is made of sixty queens, and eighty concubines,
   and virgins without number; which he thinks refers to Solomon's wicked
   practice of polygamy, expressly forbidden Deuteronomy 17:17. To which I
   reply,

   1st, That the allusion does not seem to be made to the number of
   Solomon's queens and concubines, but to the custom of some princes in
   the East, which Solomon had in view; for the number of queens and
   concubines here does not agree with the number of Solomon's, recorded 1
   Kings 11:3 where he is said to have seven hundred wives, and three
   hundred concubines, which is vastly different from the account which is
   given here: and if it should be said, that though when he wrote this
   book, he had not arrived to that prodigious pitch of wickedness in the
   practice of polygamy, to which he afterwards did; yet he had begun, and
   gone a great way in it, and had at the time he wrote it, such a number
   of wives and concubines as are here mentioned, which he refers to. I
   answer,

   2dly, That it is not likely that Solomon should prefer one of his
   wives, and praise her above all the rest; which would have been the way
   to have alienated their affections from him, and made her the object of
   their envy, as well as have raised such domestic feuds and quarrels;
   which would not easily be laid. Besides,

   3dly, It does net seem reasonable to suppose that those other queens
   and concubines of Solomon's should speak so much in the praise and
   commendation of his lawful wife, as these are said to do here; which is
   not usual for such sort of persons to do. As to those other texts
   referred to, namely, chapter 1:3, 5 and 2:7 and 3:5, 10, 11 and 5:8, 16
   and 6:9 and 8:4, 6, 7 produced by Mr. Whiston, to prove that the
   person, who is the bridegroom in this song, loved many other women and
   virgins, of which his spouse is jealous; I need only say, that those
   texts do indeed express the love of the daughters of Jerusalem to him,
   and the notice which the spouse took of them, for whom she appears to
   have a very great value and affection, to whom she often points out her
   beloved, and directs them to observe the transcendent excellencies and
   beauties of his person, as well as strictly charges them to give him no
   disturbance: yet she also signifies her very great love and regard to
   him; but no where insinuates any wandering affection or wanton love in
   him unto others, or that she was jealous of him upon that account.

   2. His next reason, page 12, 13 is, "that there is no foundation for an
   allegorical, or mystical sense of this book; there being not the least
   sign of a sober, virtuous, or divine meaning therein, nor any thing
   that in the least concerns morality or virtue, God or religion, the
   Messiah or his kingdom;" which, if true, would indeed go a great way
   against the authority of it; but I hope the following Exposition will
   make it appear that there is a good foundation in it for a mystical or
   allegorical sense, agreeable enough to the analogy of faith; as well as
   shew that there are many things in it which encourage morality and
   virtue, promote the cause of God and religion, and concern the Messiah
   and his kingdom; and Mr. Whiston has not thought fit to give any one
   instance which discover, the contrary.

   3. He says, page 13, that 12 "the introduction of double or mystical
   senses of scripture among the Jews, is much later than the days of
   Solomon, and cannot therefore be supposed to belong to any book of his
   writing:" but this does not appear to be true, for surely the speech of
   Jotham to the men of Shechem, recorded in Judges 9 must be understood
   in an allegorical or mystical sense; and Nathan's parable, 2 Samuel
   12:1 which was delivered before Solomon's time. Moreover, the
   forty-fifth Psalm is of the very same strain, and bears a very near
   resemblance with this song, which was wrote by David, Solomon's father:
   besides, suppose this allegorical and mystical way of writing had not
   been used before by the inspired writers, it is no argument that it
   should not be used now, as it was afterwards in the writings of the New
   Testament, as Mr. Whiston confesses, page 22.

   4. Another reason which he produces, page 23, is, that "neither the
   contemporary nor succeeding writers of the Old Testament, ever quote or
   allude to this book of Canticles, nor to any part thereof, upon any
   occasion whatsoever." The same may be said of many other books of the
   Old Testament, whose authority was never yet called in question; nor
   can this be looked upon by judicious persons, a sufficient reason why
   any of them should.

   5. He says, page 24, "The apocryphal writers of the Old Testament,
   never quote nor allude to this book, nor to any part thereof, upon any
   occasion whatsoever." Which I persuade myself, wilt he no wars shocking
   or stumbling to any thoughtful Christian, nor belooked upon by them as
   a sufficient objection against the authority of it; had they expressly
   opposed it, it could not have been very considerably improved against
   it, much less will their silence have any force to explode it; and yet
   after all, in Ecclesiastes 47:18. Solomon is admired for his Songs,
   Proverbs, and Parables.

   6. He urges, page 25, that "Philo, the eminent Alexandrian Jew, who was
   contemporary with Christ and his earliest apostles, and who was
   prodigious fond of mystical or allegorical senses of scripture, does
   yet never cite nor allude to this book of Canticles, nor to any part of
   it, on any occasion whatsoever." Be it so, that it is not once cited or
   alluded to in his writings; for though they are voluminous, there are
   but few citations of scripture in them; yet it does not follow from
   thence that it must be spurious. Many books in the canon of scripture,
   whose authority is unquestionable, would yet stand upon a very
   precarious foundation, if citations out of them and allusions to them
   in human writings, were absolutely necessary to their continuance in
   it.

   7. What he lays a considerable stress upon, and makes the main
   foundation for the exclusion of this book, is, that Josephus not only
   neither cites nor alludes to it, but has also left it out in his
   catalogue of the sacred writings. That he should neither cite nor
   allude unto it, in writing a history, need not be wondered at; but if
   it can be made to appear that it is not to be found in his catalogue,
   it will indeed be a considerable objection against it. Now the account
   which Josephus [16] gives of the sacred writings among the Jews is only
   this, namely, that they had only two and twenty books, five of which
   are books of Moses, thirteen wrote by the prophets, and the other four
   contained holy hymns and moral precepts. Now in this account he seems
   to have regard to the division of the books of the Old Testament into
   three parts, [17] used by the Jews: which was first, the Law; secondly,
   the Prophets; and thirdly, the Hagiographa; which our Lord also takes
   notice of, Luke 24:44 where he saith, These are the words which I spake
   unto you: while 1 was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled,
   which were written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the
   Psalms, concerning me; where by the Psalms is meant the whole third
   part called the Hagiographa, because it began with that book; which
   also contained the most plain and manifest testimonies, of the person,
   office, and sufferings of Christ; more than any other book in that part
   did. Now the order of the books, according to this division of them,
   which Josephus has a regard to, was this, namely,

   In the Law, which was the first division, stood

   These are the five books of Moses, according to Josephus.

   1. Genesis.

   2. Exodus.

   3. Leviticus.

   4. Numbers.

   5. Deuteronomy.

   In the Prophets, which was the second division, stood

   These are the thirteen books of the prophets, according to Josephus.

   1. Joshua.

   2. Judges, with Ruth; which make but one book.

   3. Samuel 1 and 2 but one book, hence Samuel is called a prophet, Acts
   13:20.

   4. Kings 1 and 2 but one book.

   5. Isaiah.

   6. Jeremiah, with the Lamentations, but one book.

   7. Ezekiel.

   8. Daniel.

   9. The twelve minor prophets, but one book. See Mark 1:2; Acts 7:42.

   10. Job.

   11. Ezra and Nehemiah, but one book.

   12. Esther.

   13. Chronicles 1 and 2 but one book.

   In the Hagiographa, which was the third division, stood

   These are the four books containing holy hymns and moral precepts,
   according to Josephus.

   1. Psalms.

   2. Proverbs.

   3. Ecclesiastes.

   4. Solomon's Song; in all twenty-two.

   From hence it appears, that there is no force in this objection; nor
   has Mr. Whiston any reason to charge Dean Prideaux with forcing this
   book of Solomon's Song into Josephus's catalogue; for his twenty-two
   books cannot be made up without it; though the Dean had no manner of
   reason to leave out the book of Chronicles, seeing Ezra and Nehemiah,
   which he makes to be two books, are comprehended in one by the Jews,
   which he himself also observes. [18] The Jews indeed, at this present
   time, reckon the books of the Old Testament to be twenty-four, and that
   by making Ruth, which is a continuation of the history of the book of
   Judges and the Lamentations, which were wrote by Jeremy; and so
   properly belong to him, two books distinct by themselves; and even in
   this account of theirs of the sacred writings, this book of Canticles
   keeps its place, nor did they ever pretend to exclude it.

   8. Another argument used by Mr. Whiston, page 29, is, that "our blessed
   Savior himself does never once make the least allusion to this book, or
   to any part of it, on any occasion whatsoever." To this I reply, that
   it appears plain and manifest, that several phrases used by our Savior
   bear a near resemblance with, are allusions to, and seem to be taken
   out of this book: thus the efficacious grace of God is expressed by
   drawing, John 6:44 agreeable to Song of Solomon 1:4. In his discourse
   with Nicodemus, he compares the Holy Spirit to the wind, John 3:8 which
   metaphor is used Song of Solomon 4:16, likewise he seems manifestly to
   allude in Matthew 13:52 where the instructed Scribe is said to bring
   forth things new and old, to Song of Solomon 7:13 where the very phrase
   is used: as also his comparing the church to a vineyard, and letting it
   out to husbandmen, are very agreeable to, and are the very phrases used
   Song of Solomon 8:11, 12. To all which might be added, several other
   resemblances and allusions, which are to be found in the evangelic
   history, as Matthew 25:1, 5 compared with Song of Solomon 5:2 and
   Matthew 9:13; John 3:29, where Christ is called the bridegroom, and the
   disciples the children of the bride-chamber, agreeable to the several
   parties in this song.

   9. He says, page 30, that "when St. John, the beloved disciple, came at
   the end of his Revelation, to this very matter of the marriage of the
   Lamb, or Messias; yet have we not a word of it; that is, this book, nor
   the least allusion to it, nor to any part of it, whatsoever." That
   John, in his book of Revelation, refers and alludes to this of
   Solomon's song, seems undeniable; every one may easily observe what a
   likeness and resemblance there is between the description which the
   spouse gives of her beloved in Song of Solomon 5 and that which John
   gives of Christ in Revelation 1. Moreover, the phrase of Christ's
   standing at the door, and knocking, Revelation 3:20. manifestly refers
   unto and plainly appears to be taken out of Song of Solomon 5:2. where
   the spouse says, It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying,
   Open to me, etc. Besides, what John says of the marriage of the Lamb,
   and the preparation of the bride for it if it is not an allusion to,
   yet it is a confirmation of what is said in this book, where the church
   is represented as beautifully arrayed and adorned, and as passionately
   wishing for the consummation of the marriage; nay, this, is spoken of
   as completed, Song of Solomon 2:16 and the glory and pomp of the
   solemnity described, Song of Solomon 3:11 with the joy that was
   expressed on that occasion; for there the day of his espousals is
   called the day of the gladness of his heart: also it deserves our
   notice, that those two books of Revelation and Solomon's Song, conclude
   much in the same manner. John closes his book of the Revelation, and
   with it the canon of the scriptures, with a passionate wish for
   Christ's second coming, saying, Amen: even so, come, Lord Jesus: and
   the church concludes the book of Solomon's Song thus; Make haste, my
   beloved, and be thou like to a roe, or to a young hart upon the
   mountains of spices.

   10. As what he thinks will much prejudice the authority of this book,
   he says, page 30, that the writers of the known books of the New
   Testament, with their earliest companions the apostolical fathers of
   the first century; St. Matthew, St. John, St. Peter, St. Paul, St.
   Mark, St. Luke, St. James, St. Jude, St. Clement in his epistles, St.
   Barnabas, that prodigious allegorizer, and St. Hermas: I may add, says
   he, and St. Polycarp also, one of their later companions, do never once
   cite or allude to this book of Canticles, or to any part of it, on any
   occasion whatsoever." That the evangelists, Matthew and John, either in
   using their own, or in recording the words of Christ, have alluded to
   some passages in this book, I have already shewn; and the same may be
   said of the other evangelists, Mark and Luke, who mention several of
   the very same things; for which see Mark 2:19, 20 and 12:1; Luke 5:34,
   35 and 20:9, and it seems very evident, the apostle Paul has reference
   to it in many passages of his writings, as wilt appear from comparing 2
   Corinthians 2:14, 15, 16;.17 Ephesians 5:2 with Song of Solomon 1:3 as
   also Colossians 2:16, 17; Hebrews 10:1 with Song of Solomon 2:17 and
   4:6 to which may be added Ephesians 5:27 compared with Song of Solomon
   4:7. So that seeing there are so many passages in several of the
   writers of the known books of the New Testament, which bear so near a
   resemblance, and have so manifest an allusion to some parts of this
   book, it need not much concern us that Clement, Barnabas, Hermas, and
   Polycarp take no notice of it.

   11. What he thinks will much prejudice the authority of this book, is,
   "that the Apostolical Constitutions give no manner of reason to suppose
   that this book of Canticles was then looked upon as a book of
   scripture, but the direct contrary." Now those books called The
   Constitutions of the Apostles, by Clement, Mr. Whiston looks upon to be
   truly authentic and apostolical; when they appear manifestly to be
   spurious, entirely destitute of apostolical authority, are of a much
   later date than the times of the apostles, and contain several things
   and doctrines directly opposite unto them. As for instance, praying
   with the face to the East is enjoined, 1. 2. c. 57. and 1. 7. c. 44.
   Trigamy is asserted to be an indication of incontinency; and such
   marriages as are beyond the third, are called manifest fornication, and
   unquestionable uncleanness, 1. 3. c. 2. Anointing with oil in baptism
   is enjoined, 1. 3. c. 15, 16, and 1. 7. c. 27, 41, 42. The keeping of
   the day of Christ's nativity, Epiphany, the Quadragesima, or Lent, the
   feast of the passover, and the festivals of the apostles, 1. 5. c. 13
   and 1. 8. c. 33. Fasting on the fourth and sixth days of the week, 1,
   5. c. 15. Baptizing of infants, 1. 6. c. 15. Singing for the dead, and
   honoring of their relics, 1. 6, c. 30. Nay, praying for saints
   departed, 1. 8. c. 41, 42, 43, 44. As also crossing with the sign of
   the cross in the forehead, 1. 8. c. 12. Moreover the Lord's Supper is
   called an unbloody sacrifice, 1. 6. c. 23 and 1. 8. c. 5, 46. It is
   likewise asserted, that Christ, in the celebration of that ordinance,
   mixed wine and water in the cup, 1. 8. c. 12. Nay, concubines,
   continuing so, are allowed an admittance to a participation of that
   sacred ordinance, 1. 8 c. 32 with many other things which appear
   foreign enough from the simplicity of the apostolic age, doctrine, and
   practice. And now who that reads and considers these things, will ever
   think that those writings can furnish out an argument sufficient to
   prejudice the authority of the book of Solomon's Song? Had any thing
   been said in them, which was expressly against it, it would scarce have
   deserved consideration, much less should their silence about it be
   improved as an evidence against it. And yet after all, it is pretty to
   observe how much Mr. Whiston himself is foiled with two passages in
   them, which appear to be allusions and references to a passage in this
   book; the one is in 1. 6. c. 13. where the false apostles are called
   alwpe&gt;kwn meridev kai&lt; camaizh&gt;lwn a&lt;mpelw&gt;nwn
   ajfanisai, the portion of foxes, and the spoilers of the low vineyards:
   And again, in the same book, c. 18. where those same persons are said
   to spoil the church of God, wjv ajlw&gt;pekev mikroi&gt; ajmpelw~nav,
   as the little foxes do the vineyards; which are manifest references to
   Song of Solomon 2:15, and over-against the later of which passages Mr.
   Whiston himself has placed this text as referring to it in the edition
   of the Constitutions which he has published. Now to evade the force of
   this, he is obliged to make this part of the work to be of a later date
   than the rest, even later than the destruction of Jerusalem; lest this
   book of Canticles should appear to have obtained authority too early in
   the world. He acknowledges that it is in the catalogue of the sacred
   writings mentioned in the Canons of the Apostles, Can. 85 which he
   looks upon to be genuine and authentic, though he questions its being
   in the original copies of those Canons; he allows, that Ignatius, in
   his larger epistle to the Ephesians, cites Song of Solomon 1:3, 4, and
   is very willing to grant it a place in Melito's catalogue, which I have
   before mentioned: So that from the whole it appears, that the
   Apostolical Constitutions are so far from making against the authority
   of this book, that they rather make for it; though their testimony is
   good for nothing, the whole being a spurious work, and carries in it
   evident marks of falsehood and impiety, and was condemned as false and
   heretical by the sixth general synod held at Constantinople [19] about
   the year 680. Thus have I considered the several arguments and
   objections produced by Mr. Whiston to disprove the sacred authority of
   this book, which, notwithstanding, appears to have a divine stamp upon
   it. [20] There is one objection more made against it, which I think Mr.
   Whiston has took no notice of, and that is, that no proper name of God
   is to be found in this Song. To which I reply, in the words of Mr.
   Durham [21]

   1. "That it is so also in other scriptures, as in the book of Esther;
   the scripture's authority doth not depend on naming the name of God,
   but on having his warrant and authority.

   2. This Song being allegorical and figurative, it is not so meet nor
   consistent with its stile, to have God named under proper names, as in
   other scriptures: Yet,

   3. There are titles and descriptions here given to an excellent person,
   which can agree to none other but Christ, the eternal Son of God; as,
   The King; O thou whom my soul loveth; the chief of ten thousands; the
   Rose of Sharon, and the like; whereby his eminency is "singularly set
   out above all others in the world."

   And yet after all, the name of God, Jah, the same with Jehovah, and a
   contraction of that, is mentioned in it, which is the greatest of the
   divine names, and is expressive of the being, eternity, and
   immutability of God. It is in chapter 8:6. hyAtbhlç the flame of God,
   or Jehovah, which we render a most vehement flame; the sense being
   increased by the word Jah being added, as the word God to mountains and
   cedars, in Psalm 36:6 and Psalm 80:10 for these are not one word as Ben
   Asher thinks, but two according to Ben Naphtali and Aben Ezra; see the
   exposition of the place.

   Since the second edition of this Exposition was published in 1751, I
   have met with two learned gentlemen, I am sorry for it, and that I am
   obliged to take notice of them, who think that this book is of a later
   date than the times of Solomon, and so of course none of his, and which
   must sap the authority of it. The one observes [22] that the word
   David, from its first appearance in Ruth, where it is written drd
   without the yod, continues to be so written through the books of
   Samuel, Kings, Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, but
   appears with a yod dyrd in the books of Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and
   Zechariah; wherefore he suggests, that if it was customary to write
   this word without a yod till the captivity, and with one after it; then
   he thinks a strong argument may be drawn from hence against the
   antiquity of the Canticles, and its being made by Solomon, since this
   name is written with a yod in Song of Solomon 4:4 the only place in it
   in which it is used: But in answer to this, it must be said, it is not
   fact that the word is universally used without the yod in the books
   mentioned, particularly in the book of Kings: for the authors of the
   Masorah have observed on 1 Kings 3:14 that it is five times written
   full, as they call it, that is, with a yod, dyrd three of the places in
   the book of Kings I have traced out, 1 Kings 3:14; and 11:4, 36 and
   have found it so written in all the printed copies I have seen; and so
   it is read by the Eastern Jews in Ezekiel 37:24 and in several printed
   editions of Ezekiel 34:23. This learned man is aware that it is so
   written once in Hosea, and twice in Amos; books written two hundred
   years before the captivity; but then he observes that in the two last
   places in Bomberg's edition it has a little circle (o) to mark it for
   an error, or a faulty word, though none over the word in Hosea: But it
   should be known, that that circle in hundreds of places is not used to
   point out any thing faulty in the copy, but is only a mark referring to
   the margin, and to what is observed there: and be it, that it does
   point out an error or a faulty word, the same circle is over the word
   in Canticles, and consequently shews it to be faulty there, and to be
   corrected and read without the yod, which observation destroys the
   argument from it; and so it is read in that place in the Talmud [23]
   without it, and in the ancient book of Zohar; [24] and indeed it seems
   as if it was read without the yod in the copies seen by the authors of
   the Masorah, since in their note on 1 Kings 3:14 besides the five
   places where it is written full, or with the yod, they say it is so
   written throughout the Chronicles, the twelve minor prophets, and Ezra,
   which includes Nehemiah, but make no mention of Solomon's Song; which
   one would think they would have done, had it been so written there in
   the copy or copies before them: so that upon the whole, the argument,
   if it has any force in it, turns out for, and not against the antiquity
   of Solomon's Song. But this matter stands in a dearer light by
   observing the larger Masorah on 1 Kings 11:4 and on Ezekiel 34:23 in
   which the five places are mentioned where this word is written full, 1
   Kings 3:14 and 11:4, 36, Song of Solomon 4:4, Ezekiel 34:23, in which
   places this word was originally so written, as well as throughout
   Chronicles, the twelve prophets, and Ezra; so that in all these places
   it is marked not as a faulty word, but as rightly written, though
   different from what it is in other places. The other learned man [25]
   forms his argument from the use of the word tbhlç in Job 15:30, and in
   this Song, chapter 8:6 his words are, "I am much deceived if this word
   be not a strong proof of the age of this poem, (the book of Job) for it
   is not found but in Ezekiel and the Song of Solomon, the one written
   during the captivity, and the other after it." This proceeds upon a
   false piece of criticism in a twofold respect; for he adds, "its
   construction which is evidently ç for rça, and tbhl the constructive
   form of hbhl flamma, shews very clearly its age; since that manner of
   abbreviation is not found in the books undoubtedly written before the
   captivity." For, 1st, this abbreviation appears in books much more
   ancient than that, not only in the book of Solomon's Song, the
   antiquity of which is not to be set aside by this observation, but
   frequently in the book of Ecclesiastes, undoubtedly written by Solomon,
   and in the Psalms of David his father before him; for it is not only in
   psalms without a title, all which are supposed by some to be David's,
   as in Psalm 129:6, 7; 135:2, 8, 10; 136:23, and 146:5 but also in
   psalms which bear his name, as in Psalm 122:3, 4; 124:2, 6; 133:2, 3
   and 144:15; yea it was in use long before the times of David, even in
   the times of the Judges. Deborah has it in her song, ytmqç ytmqç d[,
   Judges 5:7 and in other places in that book, chapter 6:17 and 7:12 and
   8:26. 2dly, It is a mistake that the construction of the word tbhlç is
   ç for rça; and tbhl; for ç; in that word is not servile, but radical,
   as Aben Ezra and Ben Melech observe; it is an addition to the Hebrew
   word after the Chaldee manner, and has its derivation from a root in
   the Chaldee or Syriac language, bhlç, which signifies to kindle,
   inflame, and burn, as appears, not only from all the Syriac and Chaldee
   Lexicons, but from the frequent use of the word in the Syriac version
   of the Old Testament; nor is this the only Chaldee or Syriac word in
   Solomon's Song; see chapter 1:17 and 2:11. Though perhaps as this
   writer from [26] the Chaldaisms, Syriasms, and Arabisms in the book of
   Job, argues its being a production of a later age than what is usually
   assigned to it; so another of the same way of thinking and reasoning
   may conclude from some Chaldee words used in Solomon's Song that it
   must be of a later age than his: but why may not Solomon be thought to
   make use of Chaldee or Syriac words as wall as his father David, who
   makes use of words in the Syriac signification of them, as in Psalm
   51:4 compared with Romans 3:4 and Psalm 60:4 and with Syro-chaldaic
   affixes, Psalm 103:3, 4, 5 and 115:7, 10? and why may not David and
   Solomon be thought to understand Chaldee or Syriac as well as
   Hezekiah's courtiers? See 2 Kings 18:26 and certainly Solomon must
   understand it, if what is said of him is true, though I lay no stress
   upon it, that he wrote the book of Wisdom in the Chaldee language [27]
   though not by inspiration. Moreover, since the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac,
   Arabic, etc. are supposed to be dialects of the same language, why may
   not a word in one dialect less frequently, used in a book appear in it
   without determining the age of it? since one dialect may be as early or
   nearly as early as another, and can be no evidence of a book being of a
   later production than is generally thought, or of its being written
   when the purity of the Hebrew language began to decline, and after the
   dispersion of the Jews throughout the East, when it began to receive a
   taint of the other dialects, as this writer suggests; for what taint of
   the other dialects, as he calls it, did the Hebrew language receive in
   the captivity, and by the dispersion of the Jews? what appearance is
   there of Chaldaisms, Syriasms, etc. in the book of Haggai, Zechariah,
   and Malachi, excepting the names of the months, books written after the
   captivity, more than in any books before, or even so much? are they not
   written in as pure Hebrew as any of those books, which may be thought
   to be written when that language was in its greatest purity? and if so,
   a few words in another dialect here and there in a book, is no rule to
   judge of a book by, and determine the age of it. Upon the whole, it is
   irresistibly clear, that the sacred and divine authority of this book
   remains firm and unshaken, notwithstanding the above objections made
   against it; nor is there any reason for persons to scruple it, much
   less to reject it from the canon of the scriptures, nor to question in
   the least the antiquity and authenticity of it. I proceed,

   II.To consider the nature and subject of this book; it being a Song in
   which the bride and bridegroom, with their friends and companions, the
   daughters of Jerusalem, bear their several parts; and it being a divine
   song, is, no doubt, intended for the glorifying of Christ, the cheering
   and refreshing of his church, and also the edification of others; for
   it is the duty of saints to be teaching and admonishing one another in
   psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs; singing with grace in their
   hearts to the Lord. I shall not enter into the consideration of the
   controversy, whether singing of the praises of God vocally, is an
   ordinance to be used under the New Testament, though I firmly believe
   it to be so; nay, that it is one of the most noble, and most glorious
   branches of religious worship, it being that which comes nearest to the
   employment of saints in a glorified state; and what requires a great
   deal of light, knowledge, experience, faith, and love to perform in a
   right way and manner; nor shall I need to observe those several cases
   of conscience concerning singing, which have a very good solution from
   this tong; such as these, namely, whether the distressed cases of God's
   children may be sung, or they sing when in distressed circumstances:
   whether complaints of their sins, failings and infirmities, may be put
   into their songs: whether eases different from theirs, yea, such as
   they have not attained unto, may be sung; as also whether it is lawful
   to sing the praises of God in mixed assemblies; all which may be
   answered in the affirmative, and for which this song affords a
   sufficient foundation; the church here bringing net sorrows and
   distresses into this song as well as her comforts and privileges,
   chapter 1:6 and 3:1 and 5:7; nay, her sins and failings, chapter 1:5, 6
   and 5:2, 3, 4. Very different cases are also here sung; yea, such,
   which, if taken in a strict sense, she had not fully attained to, as in
   chapter 8:12. Moreover, she sings in the presence of, and joins with
   the virgins, the daughters of Jerusalem, who seemed in a great measure
   to be ignorant of Christ, chapter 5:8, 9 and 6:8, 9, 10, all which are
   largely and judiciously insisted upon by the excellent Mr. Durham, in
   his Exposition of this place, to which I refer the reader: I proceed
   more particularly to consider the nature and subject of this song;
   which,

   1st, Is not a celebration of the amours between Solomon, and Pharoah's
   daughter, which has been the opinion of some, as has been already
   observed; for there are some things in it which are spoken of this
   bridegroom, which cannot be applied to Solomon, as that he was both a
   king and a shepherd, as in chapter 1:4 compared with 5:7 that he was
   his wife's brother, and she his sister, chapter 5:2 and 8:1. Nor is it
   likely that Solomon would ever give such commendations of himself, as
   are mentioned in chapter 5:10, etc. There are also many things spoken
   of the bride, which by no means agree with Pharoah's daughter, as that
   she was a keeper of the vineyards, chapter 1:6 and yet a prince's
   daughter, chapter 7:1 that she should be represented as running about
   the streets in the night, unattended, chapter 3:2 and be exposed to the
   blows and contempt of the watchmen, chapter 5:7; besides, several of
   the descriptions here given of her, if taken in a literal sense, would
   rather make her appear to be a monster than a beauty, as chapter 4:1-5
   and chapter 7:1-5 all which agree very well, when understood of Christ
   and his Church. Nor,

   2dly, Is it typical, that is to say, this book does not express the
   amours and marriage of Solomon and Pharoah's daughter, as typical of
   that inexpressible love and marriage-union between Christ and his
   church; it is true, there is some resemblance between natural and
   spiritual marriage, as is manifest from Ephesians 5:23, 24, 25, 29, 31,
   32 nor is it altogether to be denied, that Solomon was a type of
   Christ, in some respects, in his marriage of that person; but that this
   book is an epithalamium, or nuptial song composed by him on that
   occasion, and that in such a manner, as at the same time also to be
   expressive of the love of Christ to his church, must be denied; for
   Solomon's marriage with Pharoah's daughter was at least twenty years
   before this book was wrote, as appears from chapter 7:4 where mention
   is made of the tower of Lebanon, by which seems to be meant, the house
   of the forests of Lebanon: or some tower near unto it; now he was seven
   years in building the temple, 1 Kings 6:38 and thirteen more in
   building his own house, 1 Kings 7:1 after which he built this, 5:2.
   From hence it may be reasonably concluded, that this book was not
   penned on any such occasion; for Solomon would never write a nuptial
   song twenty years after his marriage, which should have been sung the
   same night he was married. M. Bossuet [28] has an ingenious conjecture,
   though it seems to be without a solid foundation, that whereas the
   nuptial feast with the Hebrews was kept seven days, this song is to be
   distributed into seven parts, a part to be sung on each day during the
   celebration. The first day, chapter 1:1 - 2:6, the second day, chapter
   2:7-17, the third day, chapter 3:1 - 5:1, the fourth day, chapter 5:2 -
   6:9, the fifth day, chapter 6:10 - 7:11, the sixth day, chapter 7:12. -
   8:3, the seventh day, chapter 8:4-14. Nor,

   3dly. Is this book prophetic, expressing the state of the church and
   kingdom of Christ in the several ages of the world, with regard to
   particular historical facts and events, which had befell or should
   befall it, either under the Old or New Testament-dispensation; this way
   indeed go most of the Jewish interpreters, as the Targum, R. Solomon
   Jarchi, and R. Aben Ezra; who have been followed by many Christian
   writers, though with more judgment and greater regard to the analogy of
   faith, as well as to the times of the New Testament: and who consider
   this book as describing the state of the church of God, whether the
   church under the legal dispensation, from the times of David and
   Solomon; and before, and in, and after the captivity to the birth and
   death of Christ; or the church under the gospel-dispensation,, in its
   beginning, progress, various changes, and consummation, as Brightman
   and Cotton. Others interpret this book as pointing to the several ages
   and periods of the Christian church, in agreement with the seven
   churches of Asia, as Cocceius, and those that follow him, Hor-chius,
   Hofman, and Hennischius; which last writer makes this distribution of
   them: 1. The church at Ephesus, Song of Solomon 1:5-17 from the
   ascension of Christ to heaven, A.C. 33 to 370. 2. The church at Smyrna,
   Song of Solomon 2:1-17 from A.C. 371 to 707. 3. The church at Pergamos,
   Song of Solomon 3:1-11 from A.C. 708 to 1045. 4. The church at
   Thyatira, Song of Solomon 4:1 to chapter 5:1 from A.C. 1046 to 1383. 5.
   The church at Sardis, Song of Solomon 5:2 to chapter 6:8 from A.C. 1384
   to 1721. 6. The church at Philadelphia, Song of Solomon 6:9 to chapter
   7:14 from A.C. 1722 to 2059. 7. The church at Laodicea, Song of Solomon
   8:1-14 from A.C. 2060, and onwards. But hereby the book is made liable
   to arbitrary, groundless, and uncertain conjectures, as well as its
   usefulness for the instruction and consolation of believers, in a great
   measure, is laid aside; for then such and such parts of it, which
   regard the church and believers, in such an age or period of time, can
   only be applied to them that lived at that time, and not to others;
   whereas all, and every part of this song, the first as well as the
   last, is applicable to believers in alleges of the world, which is a
   manifest proof that it cannot be historical, or prophetical. But,

   4thly, The whole is figurative and allegorical, abounding with a
   variety of lively metaphors, and allusions to natural things; and so
   may be illustrated by the various things of nature, from whence the
   metaphors are taken, and to which the allusions be, and by the language
   and behavior of natural lovers to each others and which are to be
   observed in love-poems, though here expressed more decently and
   beautifully. This divine poem sets forth in a most striking manner the
   mutual love, unions and communion, which are between Christ and his
   church; also expresses the several different frames, cases and
   circumstances which attend believers in this life; so that they can
   come into no state or condition, but here is something in this song
   suited to their experience: which serves much to recommend it to
   believers, and discovers the excellency of it. Which,

   III.Comes next to be considered, it being called the Song of songs, for
   this reason, because it is the most excellent of songs; so the holy of
   holies is used for the most holy, and the King of kings and Lord of
   lords, for the greatest King and chiefest Lord. This song. is more
   excellent than all human songs; there is no comparison between them,
   either in the subject, stile, or manner of composition: it has the
   ascendant of all those thousand and five songs which Solomon himself
   made, of which we read 1 Kings 4:32 nay, is preferable to all
   scriptural songs; the subject of it being wholly and purposely the love
   of Christ to his church, its stile is lovely and majestic; the manner
   of its composition neat and beautiful; and the matter of it full and
   comprehensive, being suited to all believers, and their several cases:
   This song indeed contains all others in it, and has nothing wanting and
   deficient therein. The Jews say in their ancient book of Zohar [29]
   that "this song comprehends the whole law; the whole work of the
   creation; the secret of the fathers; the captivity of Egypt, and the
   coming out of Israel from thence; the song that was sung at the sea;
   the covenant of mount Sinai; the journey of the Israelites through the
   wilderness; their entrance into the land of Canaan; the building of the
   temple; the crown of the holy name; the captivity of Israel among the
   nations, and their redemption; the resurrection of the dead; and the
   sabbath of the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come."

   IV.The author or penman of this song is said to be Solomon; the Song of
   songs, which is Solomon's, that is, which is of, or concerning Solomon,
   [30] as the words may be rendered; and so respect the subject of this
   song, which is Christ, the true Solomon, of whom Solomon was an eminent
   type, as is at large shewn in several particulars, on chapter 3:7. Now
   it is he that this song treats of; the transcendent glories and
   excellencies of his person; his inexpressible love unto, care of, and
   concern for his church and people, together with the nearness of access
   unto and sweet communion and fellowship with himself, which he indulges
   them with, are here particularly expressed and set forth; so that it
   may well be called the Song of songs, which is concerning Solomon;
   though, perhaps, the words may regard Solomon as the author and penman
   of it, who was used by the Holy Ghost as his amanuensis therein, which
   was no small honor to him; his wisdom, riches, and grandeur, did not
   set him above an employment of this nature; nay, his, being concerned
   herein, was a greater honor to him than all the rest: and it may not be
   amiss to observe, that his royal title, as king of Israel, is here
   omitted, which yet is put at the beginning of both his other books,
   Proverbs and Ecclesiastes; the reason may be, either because such a
   title, expressive of majesty, would not so well have suited a song of
   loves; or else it is purposely omitted, lest he should be thought to be
   the king, so frequently spoken of in this song; or rather because that
   the subject of this song is the King of kings; and therefore, whilst he
   is speaking of the things which he had made, touching the Mug, he lays
   aside his own royal title, veils his majesty, and casts his crown at
   the feet of Him, by whom kings reign, and princes decree justice. The
   time of his writing this book does not appear very manifest; some think
   that he wrote it in his youthful days, the subject being love, and the
   manner of its writing being poetry, both which the youthful age mostly
   inclines to, and delights in; but it appears from what has been already
   said, that it was not wrote until twenty years after his marriage, when
   he could not be a very young man; and so might be written in the middle
   part of his life, when in the most flourishing circumstances as to
   body, mind, and estate. Dr Lightfoot [31] is of opinion it might be
   written in the thirtieth year of his reign, about ten years before his
   death, after he had built his summerhouse in Lebanon, to which he
   supposes he alludes in chapter 4:3 and 7:4 and upon his bringing
   Pharaoh's daughter to the house prepared for her, 1 Kings 9:24. The
   Jewish chronologer [32] says, that the books of Proverbs, the Song of
   songs, and Ecclesiastes, were all written in his old age, as indeed the
   last seems to be; and perhaps he wrote this also a little before his
   death, after his fall and repentance, when he had had a larger
   discovery of the love of God unto his own soul, notwithstanding all his
   sins, failings, and infirmities; and so a proper person for the Holy
   Ghost to use in setting forth the greatness of Christ's love to his
   people, and the several different states, conditions, cases and
   circumstances, which they are, at one time or another, brought into in
   this life, of which he had had a very great experience. But from the
   title, I shall now proceed to the consideration of the book itself;
   which thus begins,

Chapter 1 Verse 2

   Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;
   for thy love is better than wine.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word considered the title, now follows the song itself, which
   begins with these words; and it being dialogue-wise, where several
   parties are concerned, and do interchangeably speak, it will be
   therefore necessary, in order to explain them, to consider,

   I.Who the person is that speaks and begins the song.

   II.To whom this speech is directed.

   III.The nature of the request that is made. And,

   IV.The reason of it.

   I.Let us consider who the person is that speaks; it appears dearly to
   be the church and bride of Christ, who here begins and continues
   speaking to verse 8. She first directs her speech to Christ, in this
   and the two following verses; in verses 5, 6 she turns herself to the
   daughters of Jerusalem; and then again to Christ, in verse 7 she begins
   the song, which,

   1st, Does not suppose that she was first in her love to Christ: she was
   not beforehand with him, neither in her love nor in the expressions,
   and manifestations of it; for he had loved her with an everlasting
   love, and therefore had thus sweetly drawn her with the bands of love,
   to himself. Christ is first, both in his love and in the discovery of
   it; for we love him because he first loved us; it is the manifestation
   of Christ's love to our souls, which causes us to love him again, and
   in some way or other to shew it.

   2dly, Neither does it suppose, that her love to Christ, and desires of
   his presence and company, were more ardent than his were to her; for as
   Christ's love is prior to ours, so it far exceeds, and is much superior
   to it; neither can believers be more desirous of Christ's company than
   he is of theirs. But,

   3dly, It shews that she was impatient of delay, and could not bear his
   absence any longer; she was sick of love; for hope deferred maketh the
   heart sick; she had, perhaps, been hoping, waiting for, and expecting
   his presence a considerable time, and he was not come; therefore
   growing impatient., breaks out in this abrupt manner, Let him kiss,
   etc. or, "O that he would kiss me with one of the kisses of his month!
   I cannot be easy unless he does."

   4thly, She speaks as one who had had experience of Christ's love; she
   knew how sweet the kisses of his mouth were, and how delightful his
   company had been to her in time past; she, had tasted that the Lord was
   gracious; and therefore was so earnestly desirous of the returns of
   these love-visits, venting her heart and soul in these passionate
   wishes and desires. And,.29

   5thly, Though Christ gives the first discoveries of love on his part;
   yet when the church is espoused unto him, it highly becomes her to shew
   an affectionate regard unto him, and strong desire after his company.

   II.It will be proper to take notice of the person to whom this speech
   is directed, and that is Christ; and the form of speech here used, is
   also worthy our regard; here is no particular mention made of any
   person; no one particularly named, whose company she desired; but only
   him, let him kiss me, etc. it is a relative without an antecedent, of
   which we have many instances in scripture, as Psalm 87:1, Isaiah 53:2,
   Lamentations 3:1 unless we suppose that the antecedent to it is
   Solomon, in verse 1, let him, that is, Solomon, or Christ, who is
   Solomon's antitype, whose song this is, and who is the subject of it;
   Let him, I say, kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; though the
   connection seems rather to be with the thoughts of her heart, than with
   any words before expressed: she had had him so much in her thoughts,
   and her love was so fixed on him, she knew him so well, and had had so
   much converse with him, that she thought there was no need to mention
   his name; but that every one must very well know who she designed; as
   Mary Magdalen, at Christ's sepulcher, when Jesus said unto her, "Woman,
   why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?" she supposing him to be the
   gardener, saith unto him, "sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me
   where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away," (John 20:15).
   Suppose he had been the gardener, how should he have known who this him
   was she meant? But she was much in the same frame as the church is
   here, who speaks of Christ as if there was no other in the world
   besides him; and indeed he is a nonsuch, the most eminent person in the
   world, in the believer's esteem; whose language is, "Whom have I in
   heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides
   thee," (Ps. 73:25). Christ then is the person here spoken of, whom she
   intends, and to whom she directs her speech.

   III.Having taken notice of the person speaking, and to whom this speech
   is directed, we will now consider the request itself, which is here
   made, "Let him kiss me," etc. and this may be considered, either,

   First, As the request of the church under the Old Testament. And that,

   1st, For the manifestation of Christ in the flesh; than which nothing
   was more passionately longed for, and earnestly desired; many kings and
   prophets greatly desired it; yea, all the Old Testament saints did more
   or0 less pray, as David did, "O that the salvation of Israel were come
   out of Zion," (Ps. 14:7) and this they were so vehemently desirous of,
   because they knew hereby redemption from all evil would be obtained,
   the curse removed, and all spiritual blessings procured for then;
   Christ's incarnation being, like kisses, a pledge and indication of his
   love, was very desirable to the church, and as appears by her
   expressions, would be exceeding grateful to all those who were "waiting
   for the consolation of Israel:" He had sent his prophets, and by them
   had spoken unto her "at sundry times, and in divers manners;" yet she
   is not easy and contented herewith, but would have greater displays of
   his grace, by his appearing in his own person to kiss her with the
   kisses of his mouth.

   2dly, For the doctrines of the gospel, in opposition to the law. Most
   of the Jewish [33] writers understand, by the kisses of his mouth, the
   words of the law, which God spake to the people face to face; but that
   dispensation was not so desirable an one, for "they that heard that
   voice of words, intreated that the word should not be spoken to them
   any more; for they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
   hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die," (Ex. 20:19). The
   words of the law contain sharp and severe rebukes for sin; pronounce
   the sinner guilty before God; curse and condemn him, and are the
   killing letter to him; therefore these are not the kisses of Christ's
   mouth, which the church here desires; but rather they are the sweet and
   comfortable doctrines of the gospel, which may be so called,

   1. Because they come from him; they are the words of his mouth, which
   drop from him "like sweet smelling myrrh;" he is the author of them, he
   has spoke and delivered them; they proceed alone from him, and it is he
   that owns, blesses, and makes them useful to men.

   2. As kisses they carry in them intimations of his love to souls, to
   whom they come in power, and in the Holy Ghost; the love of Christ is
   the great subject of the gospel; it fills all the doctrines thereof,
   which give a noble display of it, and lead into a farther acquaintance
   with it.

   3. As the kisses of a friend, they are grateful and acceptable to
   believers; they are more valuable to them than their necessary food,
   and are preferred by them to all that is dear in life, yea, to life
   itself, however they are slighted and despised by the men of the world.

   4. As kisses, they raise the affections and fill the soul with love to
   Christ; kisses, as they are indications of, so they are incentives to
   love. When the truths of the gospel come with power upon a sinner's
   heart, they let in, not only a great deal of light, but also a large
   measure of love; faith comes hereby, and that works by love, both to
   Christ and to his gospel. Or,

   Secondly, We may consider this request as the request of the church, or
   of every particular believer, for the enjoyments and manifestations of
   Christ's love. The manifestation of Christ's love is very desirable to
   believers, who would always have it if they could; this is their heaven
   on earth, and the beginning of glory to them; this comforts them in all
   their troubles, and is preferred by them to all earthly enjoyments; and
   may be called the kisses of Christ's mouth,

   1st, Because kisses are evidences and pledges of love amongst nearest
   relations: Christ stands in, and fills up all relations to his people,
   and has affections for them suitable to them all; he is a kind and
   indulgent father, a tender husband, an affectionate brother, and loving
   friend; of all which he has given, and continues to give, full, and
   incontestible proofs; of which the kisses of his mouth are plain and
   undeniable evidences.

   2dly, Kisses are tokens of reconciliation and agreement. Now though
   reconciliation is made by the blood of Christ, and believers have the
   comfortable application of it to their souls; yet every time that
   Christ withdraws his presence from them, they are ready to think that
   he is angry with them, and is not reconciled unto them; but when he
   shews himself again, and manifests his love, then they can behold him,
   and God in him, as reconciled unto them.

   3dly, Kisses are incentives to love: there is nothing raises believers
   love higher to Christ, than the flowing in of his love into their
   souls; this warms it when cold and chill, raises it to a flame,
   quickens it when dull, puts it in motion, and sets it at work.

   4thly, By this expression the church intends that nearness and
   familiarity in communion with Christ, which her soul wanted; which was
   not only to shew himself to her, feed and feast her, and take his walks
   with her; by all which phrases communion with Christ is sometimes
   expressed; but to be kissed with the kisses of his mouth, which is yet
   nearer still: well may the saints be said to be "a people near to the
   Lord;" what wondrous and surprising grace is this, that Christ should
   condescend to kiss such vile and sinful creatures as we be! to receive
   us into such near communion with himself! It is a bold request the
   church makes, and yet she is in it no bolder than welcome. These are
   called kisses, in the plural number.

   1. To shew the various ways Christ has to manifest his love, sometimes
   by one providence, and sometimes by another! sometimes in one
   ordinance, and sometimes in another; he is not tied to one way, but has
   divers ways, and makes use of various means to shew himself unto his
   people; he is never at a loss when he thinks fit to do it.

   2. To denote the frequent and repeated actings of his love to her soul
   which she was desirous of; she was for having, not one kiss, but many;
   one discovery and manifestation of his love and grace after another;
   yea, many visits from him, until she arrived to the full enjoyment of
   his love, with himself, in glory. Or,

   3. The words may be read thus, Let him kiss me with one of the kisses
   of his mouth. [34] See chapter 4:9 and then the sense is, "O that I had
   but one glimpse, one view, one discovery more of his love and grace
   unto my soul, but one kiss more from his mouth, which is most sweet,
   and altogether lovely; how great a satisfaction would it be to me,
   could I have but this request granted!" which way of speaking shews how
   exceeding grateful the manifestations of Christ's love are to
   believers. Moreover it may be observed, that kisses with the ancients
   were not frequent, but rarely used, and but once when persons were
   espoused, and as a token of that; and then they were reckoned as
   husband and wife; [35] on which account it may be it is here desired;
   since it was after this we hear of the spouse being brought into the
   nuptial chamber, and of the keeping of the nuptial feast, verse 4-12.
   Again, These are also said to be the "kisses of his mouth;" which is
   not to be looked upon as a mere Hebraism, or as a redundancy in
   expression; but this heaping up of words shews,

   (1.) The vehemency of her affection, how much her heart was set upon,
   and how eagerly desirous she was of, communion with Christ; and
   therefore pours out words, that she might fully express her mind; "for
   out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh."

   (2.) She mentions the kisses of "his mouth," in contradistinction to
   any other; she valued the kisses of no other mouth but Christ's: the
   kisses of any mouth were not desirable to her, none but the kisses of
   his mouth were.

   (3.) She hereby expresses the singular satisfaction she should take
   herein; "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;" "his mouth,
   which is sweet and delightful to me; his mouth, whom my soul loves,
   whom I value and esteem above all others, and in the enjoyment of whom
   I place my chiefest happiness." Or,

   (4). It may point out that particular way and manner in which she was
   desirous that he would manifest his love unto her, that is, by his word
   of promise in the gospel; as if she should say, "O that he would
   manifest himself, and break up his love and grace to my soul, in some
   kind promise or other, which may drop from his mouth, and be brought
   home unto me by the Spirit of grace."

   IV.She assigns a reason for this request, "for thy love is better than
   wine;" here is a sudden change of person, from the third to the second;
   before she said, "let him kiss me," etc. now she says, "for thy love,"
   etc. the reason of which, perhaps, is, because he was absent before,
   but now present; she had lost sight of him, and speaks of him as at a
   distance from her; but now he is in view, at the very sight of whom her
   faith is increased, and her soul fired with love; and having greater
   nearness to him, grows in her familiarity and boldness with him.

   Here we shall, 1. Take notice of the love of Christ, and give some
   account of the nature and excellency, of it: And, 2. Shew in what
   respects it is preferable to wine.

   First Let us consider this love of Christ, which is so highly commended
   by the church; in the Hebrew text it is in the plural number, loves
   [36] to shew,

   1st, The various ways in which Christ has discovered it; he shewed it
   by his suretyship-engagements for the elect in the everlasting covenant
   of grace and peace, of which he is the surety, mediator, and messenger;
   he showed it in his assumption of human nature in time; he has given a
   full display of it, in laying down his life for the sheep, in giving
   himself a ransom for many, and in offering himself a sacrifice for the
   sins of all his chosen ones; he has loved them and died for them, loved
   them and shed his precious blood for them, and in that blood, has
   washed them from all their sins; he now shews that he loves them, by
   appearing in the presence of God for them, acting as an advocate with
   the Father, and preparing glory for them; and he will, ere long, come
   again to take them to himself, that where he is, there they may be
   also.

   2dly, It may intend the various effects of it; all the blessings of
   grace flow from it, such as vocation, sanctification, justification,
   adoption, and glorification; all spring from this boundless and
   matchless love of Christ.

   3dly, Being in the plural number, may denote the aboundings of it; it
   is superabounding love; love that has heights, and depths, and lengths,
   and breadths; it is immeasurable and unconceivable; it passeth the
   perfect knowledge of men and angels.

   4thly, The frequent discoveries of it, which are made to the saints;
   and which, like the waters in Ezekiel's vision, increase and rise from
   the ankles to the knees, and from the knees to the loins, and from
   thence become waters to swim in, a river, an ocean of love which cannot
   be passed over.

   5thly, The great esteem the church had of Christ's love, which she
   shows by calling it "loves," in the plural number, as well as by saying
   that it was "better than wine:" the excellency of which will farther
   appear, if we consider the nature and properties of it, which are as
   follow:

   1. As to the original of it, it is free and sovereign; it does not take
   its rise from any thing in us, or done by us, nothing of this nature
   moved him to it, but he loved us, because he would love us; nothing out
   of himself moved him to it; it was not because we were better than
   others, for we are by nature children of wrath, even as others; he
   loved us when unlovely; he died for us while we were yet sinners, and
   ungodly in ourselves, and enemies to himself; our love to him is not
   the cause of his loving us, but his love to us is the cause of ours: in
   this he is entirely free and sovereign; he has pitched his love and
   grace on whom he will, and these he loves freely; he was not moved or
   influenced by foreseen faith or works, or any deservings of ours
   whatever; for we neither deserved nor desired his love, neither indeed
   could we have expected it.

   2. As to the time of its commencement, it is from eternity; before the
   mountains were formed, and the highest part of the dust of the earth
   was made, he was "rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and his
   delights were with the sons of men:" that he loved his people from
   eternity, is manifest from his engaging as a surety for them; his
   becoming the mediator of an everlasting covenant; in which he agreed to
   take care of their persons, and by dying to redeem their lives from
   destruction, and to bring them to eternal glory; as also from his
   receiving all grace for them before the world began; all which
   manifestly shew that he had a love for them; for all the after-actings
   of his love and grace are but the openings and breakings forth of this
   love of his, which he bore towards them from everlasting.

   3. As to its duration, it is to eternity; "having loved his own, which
   were in the world, he loved them unto the end," (John 13:1) his love is
   invariable, unalterable, and unchangeable; it is like himself, "the
   same yesterday, to-day, and for ever;" all the waters of sin and
   corruption cannot extinguish it; nor can any creature in heaven, earth,
   or hell, separate his people from it.

   4. As to the degree of it, it is the greatest love, "greater love hath
   no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends," (John
   15:13) but Christ's love is greater than this, for he hath laid down
   his life for enemies, and even whilst they were such: here is great
   love for great sinners, shewn by a great person, one who "thought it no
   robbery to be equal with God:" and this he shewed by giving himself a
   ransom for them; such is the greatness of this love, that it cannot
   fully be expressed by men or angels.

   5. As to the quality of it, it is the nearest; that of the nearest
   relations and friends to each other as of a parent to a child, of an
   husband to a wife, of brothers, or friends, to each other, are but
   faint resemblances and mere shadows of this; all fall short of painting
   and expressing to the life the nature of this love.

   6. As to the pattern or form of it, it is as the Father's love to him;
   "as the Father hath loved me; (says he) so have I loved you," (John
   15:9) as the Father loves Christ, as mediator, with an everlasting,
   unchangeable, and inseparable love, so does Christ love his people.
   What surprising grace is this, that Christ should love us with such a
   love! when there is no comparison between him, who is the object of the
   one, and them, who are the objects of the other; when we contemplate
   this amazing love, conceptions fail us to comprehend it, words fall
   short of expressing it; in eternity only will those surprising
   mysteries of grace be unfolded to us.

   7. As to any instance of love, none can be compared: with it, it is
   unparalleled; that of Jonathan's to David, of one friend's dying for
   another, and of those brave Romans who died for their country, which
   history furnishes us withal, can by no means equal or come near it;
   scarcely for a righteous man will one die, peradventure for a good man
   some would even dare to die, says the apostle, Romans 5:7, 8 where he
   alludes [37] to the division of the Jewish nation into three parts,
   which were these; First, There were µyqydx, or righteous persons, who
   kept to the external letter of the law, and did, as they imagined, what
   that required, but would do no more. Secondly, There were others called
   µydysj, or good men, who were bountiful and liberal to the poor, and
   did more than the law required in repairing the temple and maintaining
   of sacrifices, etc. But, Thirdly, there were another sort who were
   called µy[çr, or wicked and ungodly persons, who had no regard to the
   law, profligate wretches, the refuse of the people. Now for one of
   these righteous ones, says the apostle, scarce any would die, because
   what he had done, he was obliged by the law to do; peradventure for one
   of these good men, one to whom he had been kind and liberal, a person
   would even dare to die; but who will die for the other sort, the wicked
   and ungodly? not one; but God commendeth his love towards us, in that
   while-we were yet sinners, Christ died for us; O matchless and
   unparalleled love!

   8. As to its effect upon the hearts of sinners, it is surprising,
   comfortable, and rejoicing; for souls, when but just let into it, begin
   that wonder which will last through out an endless eternity; they now
   place an ecce, a behold before it, and say as the Jews did of Christ,
   in regard to Lazarus, behold how he loved him! O how has he loved me,
   and me! says one and the other; what manner of love is this! it is
   surprising, wonderful, passing the love of women, as David said
   concerning Jonathan's; and it being shed abroad in the heart by the
   Spirit of God, fills the soul with an universal pleasure, with a joy
   unspeakable and full of glory; the manifestations and discovery of it
   bear up the soul under all the trials of life, and make it long to be
   in glory, that it may have its fill thereof, wherefore it is no wonder
   the church here prefers it to wine, which,

   Secondly, We shall now consider, The church had a real value for
   Christ's person, and therefore must needs esteem his love; his person
   being, to her, the chiefest among ten thousands, his love must be
   preferable to all others; she hath tasted a real sweetness in it, and
   hath seen the vanity and emptiness of all earthly enjoyments, and
   therefore prefers it to wine; by which. is intended the most sumptuous
   banquet, with all the dainties, and delightful entertainments thereof:
   nothing is so valuable as the love of Christ; O how excellent is thy
   loving kindness! says the Psalmist, it is better than life, Psalm 36:7.
   and 63:3. and all the comforts, pleasures, and profits thereof. I will
   now endeavor to shew, in a few particulars, wherein this love of Christ
   is better than wine.

   1st, It is preferable to it for its antiquity; good old wine is
   accounted the best; and therefore Christ says, No man having drunk old
   wine, straightway desireth new: for he saith, the old is better, Luke
   5:39. Age makes wine better, but not oil, as Plutarch observes. [38]
   Now no wine is comparable to this of Christ's love, for its antiquity;
   for, as has been already shewn, it is a love which commences from
   everlasting; it does not bear date with time, but was before time was,
   and will be when time shall be no more. The Jews [39] often speak of
   wine, that has been reserved in the grape ever since the creation of
   the world, which, they imagine, they shall drink in the earthly kingdom
   of the Messiah; but this wine of divine love was laid up and reserved
   in the heart of Christ long before the creation of the world: this
   excels all other wine for its antiquity.

   2dly, It is preferable to wine for its purity; no wine so pure and
   unmixed as this of Christ's love; it is wine on the lees well refined,
   free from all the dregs of deceit, hypocrisy, and dissimulation; it is
   a love unfeigned, a pure river of water of life.

   3dly, It is better than wine, and is preferable to it for its freeness
   and cheapness; wine is not every one's liquor, every one's purse cannot
   reach it, especially in some countries; but this wine of Christ's love,
   is to be had without money, and without price, than which nothing can
   be cheaper; nor is any thing freer, for it is freely shed abroad in the
   hearts of God's people, by the Spirit.

   4thly, For the plenty of it, it is preferable to wine; wine, as it is
   dear, so it is scarce in some places; but this, as it is cheap, and to
   be had freely, so there is plenty of it: in the marriage at Cana of
   Galilee, there was want of wine; but there is no want thereof in this
   feast of love, which Christ has made for his spouse and bride: this is
   a river, nay, an ocean of love, which flows forth in plentiful streams
   to poor sinners.

   5thly, It is preferable to wine in the effects of it.

   1. Wine will revive and cheer a man that is of an heavy heart, and
   therefore it is advised to be given to such, Proverbs 31:6, yet it will
   not bring a man to life that is dead; but such is the nature of
   Christ's love, that when it is conveyed into the heart of a sinner,
   dead in trespasses and sins, it makes him alive; for whenever it is a
   time of love to a poor sinner, it is also a time of life; nay, it not
   only conveys life, but it maintains and supports it and keeps souls
   from dying; he that has had it shed abroad in his heart, by the Spirit,
   shall never die the second death.

   2. Wine may remove a worldly heaviness, or a sorrow on the account of
   worldly things, the things of time; but not of spiritual heaviness, or
   a sorrow on the account of the things or another world, the things of
   eternity; but the manifestation of Christ's love to the soul, can
   remove this sorrow and heaviness, and fill it with a joy unspeakable
   and full of glory, and give him that ease, comfort, and satisfaction of
   mind, he is wishing for:

   3. If a man drinks never such large draughts of the wine of Christ's
   love, it will never hurt him, when other wine, with excessive drinking
   of it, not only wastes the estates, but consumes the bodies, and
   destroys the health of men; but of this a man may drink freely and
   plentifully, without doing himself any hurt; nay, it will be of
   considerable advantage to him, and therefore says Christ, in chapter
   5:1. Eat, O friends, yea, drink abundantly, O my beloved.

   No wonder then that the church was so desirous of enjoying Christ's
   presence, and having the manifestations of his love to her soul, seeing
   his tore is thus better than wine; besides, it may be observed that she
   makes use of this as an argument with him to obtain her request; and in
   so doing, shews what a value she had for the love of Christ, how much
   she esteemed it, as also what it was she expected and sought after, in
   desiring communion with him.

Chapter 1 Verse 3

   Chapter 1

   VERSE 3.

   Because of the savor of thy good ointments, thy name is as ointment
   poured
   forth; therefore do the virgins love thee
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having mentioned the excellency of Christ's love, as
   the reason why she desired such intimate communion with him, proceeds
   in these words to take notice of his savory ointments and precious
   name; which were both so delightful, fragrant, and odorous, that even
   the Virgins, those chaste creatures, were ravished, and had fallen in
   love with him; and therefore it was no wonder that she, who was his
   spouse and bride, should express her love to him, and be so desirous of
   his company. In these words we have,

   I.The savor of Christ's ointments expressed.

   II.The fragrancy and preciousness of Christ's name declared:

   III.The influence that all this has upon the hearts of the virgins, in
   attracting their love to Christ: therefore do the virgins love thee.

   I.The savor of Christ's ointments is here expressed by the church, as
   having knowledge of them herself, and as having observed the effect of
   them upon the hearts of others. By ointments we are to understand the
   graces of the Spirit of God, that oil of gladness with which Christ, as
   mediator, is anointed above his fellows; this was poured out without
   measure upon him; it is like the precious ointment upon Aaron's head,
   that ran down upon his beard, and went down to the skirts of his
   garments; for this being poured upon Christ, the head, descends to all
   his members, from him they receive that anointing, which teacheth all
   things. In explaining these words, I will endeavor,

   First, To shew why the graces of the Spirit in Christ, or in his
   members, are compared to ointments.

   Secondly, Why they are called Christ's ointments.

   Thirdly, In what sense they are said to be good. And,.40

   Fourthly, What is meant by the savor of them.

   First, I shall endeavor to shew why the graces of the Spirit, either in
   Christ or in saints, are compared to ointments.

   1st, With the holy anointing oil, which was made according to a divine
   prescription and direction, kings, priests, and prophets were formerly
   anointed, and thereby installed into their several offices: thus Saul,
   David and Solomon were anointed to be kings; thus Aaron and his sons
   were anointed to be priests; and thus E1isha was anointed prophet in
   the room of Elijah: now, as with this anointing oil these were
   anointed, and thereby installed into their offices; so Christ, with the
   anointing oil of the Spirit, was anointed, and thereby installed into
   those offices which he has taken upon him, and bears for the good of
   his people; it is with this he is anointed to be king, and is set over
   God's holy hill of Zion; it is with this he is consecrated a priest for
   evermore, to offer sacrifice, and make intercession for transgressors;
   and this same Spirit being upon him, he is anointed therewith a prophet
   to "preach good tidings to the meek." Christ: as the glorious God-man,
   was anointed and installed into his office as mediator, from eternity;
   his human nature was anointed with the Holy Ghost, at the time of its
   conception in the virgin's womb; and more visibly at his baptism, when
   the Spirit descended upon him as a dove; and still more gloriously at
   his ascension to, and session at the Father's right hand, when he
   received from him the promise of the Spirit, and was made or declared
   to be both Lord and Christ: and it is with the same unction that saints
   are by him made kings and priests unto God; kings, because grace reigns
   in their hearts now, and they shall reign with Christ in glory, for
   ever hereafter; priests, "to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
   to God by Jesus Christ."

   2dly, With this holy anointing oil, all the vessels of the tabernacle
   were anointed and made fit for use; to which saints may be compared,
   who are chosen vessels, vessels of mercy, that were fore-ordained for
   glory; now these, in their natural state, are not fit for their
   master's use; yet when anointed with this unction, they are not only
   fit for their master's present use here,, but are prepared for glory
   hereafter; the saints having the oil of grace, as well as the lamps of
   profession, are ready to go in with the bridegroom, whenever he comes
   and calls for them.

   3dly, Anointing with oil was made use of for ornament; "it makes the
   face to shine," as the Psalmist says, Psalm 104:15. Christ, as man and
   mediator, is adorned with the grace of the Spirit; he is "fairer than
   the children of men;" and the reason is, because "grace is poured into
   his lips;" he has a larger measure of this "oil of gladness" than
   others, and therefore is "the perfection of beauty;" he is "white and
   ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand;" and as Christ is, so the
   saints are adorned herewith, and become beautiful in his eye, being
   "all glorious within:" by this grace they are purified and prepared,
   and so presented as a chaste and beautiful virgin to Christ.

   4thly, Anointing with oils or ointments was used for cheering and
   refreshing guests at festivals, being very useful for this purpose in
   hot countries; the smell of which was very delightful and pleasing;
   [40] hence Solomon says, "Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart;"
   (Prov. 27:9) and for this reason Mary brought ointment and anointed the
   feet of Jesus, to cool and refresh them while he sat at meat: these
   ointments, or graces of the Spirit, are the oil of gladness, both to
   Christ and to his people; in the exercise of them, he, as man, was
   delighted and refreshed, and so are his saints; the grace of the Spirit
   is, to them; the oil of joy for mourning; he, by his sweet influences
   and delightful operations on their souls, powerfully draws forth grace
   into exercise, and thereby administers much comfort to them; they are
   oftentimes filled with joy and peace in believing, being made to abound
   in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost.

   5thly, Ointments are useful for mollifying and healing wounds, Isaiah
   1:6. these being applied, soften hard tumors, break them, and then heal
   them; the hearts of sinners are hard and obdurate, being swelled with
   pride, vanity, and conceit of themselves; bat the ointments of divine
   grace being applied, softens them, breaks these hard swellings, makes
   their hearts contrite, and then heals them: Christ, the great
   physician, acting herein, like the good Samaritan, who had compassion
   on the wounded man, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine.

   Secondly, We will now consider why these ointments are said to be
   Christ's.

   1st, They are of his making; as he is God, he has an all-sufficiency of
   grace in himself, underived from any other, and is the author of all
   grace; this excellent composition is all his own; this ointment is made
   and prepared by his own hand; the holy anointing oil, though of God's
   prescribing, yet it was not of his making, though according to the
   composition of it, no other was to be made; but these ointments are not
   only prescribed, but made by him, that is God; and none can make,
   according to the composition thereof; which shews the excellency of
   them.

   2dly, He is the subject of them; as God, he is the author and maker,
   but, as mediator, they are communicated to him; they are poured into
   him, and upon him without measure; it pleased the Father, that in him
   should all fullness dwell; they are his, not only because made by him,
   but because they are in his possession; he is anointed with them above
   his fellows.

   3dly, They are his, because he has a right to dispose of them; they are
   his own as God, being the maker of them; and they are his own as
   mediator, being given to him; wherefore he may do what he will with
   them, as indeed he does; he gives these ointments to whom he will, and
   he gives them freely and plentifully; he has a fullness of all grace in
   himself, and from thence saints receive grace for grace. This ointment
   being poured plentifully upon the head, runs down freely to all the
   members; these ointments are first Christ's, and then they are ours; he
   composed them as God, for our use and service, and they were given to
   him as mediator, for that purpose; grace in Christ, and grace in us,
   are of the same nature, though not of the same degree: grace in us is
   as in its streams, but grace in Christ is as in its fountain; it is but
   a small measure we have, but it is an infinite, and inexhaustible
   fullness that is in him; which may serve to recommend Christ to us, and
   direct us where to go for these oils or ointments.

   Thirdly, They are said to be good ointments, or oils; some oils are
   better than others, and some places produced better than others: Tekoah
   was the chief place for oil in Judea, and the next to it was Regab
   beyond Jordan; [41] no doubt but Solomon had the best. The oils or
   ointments of the true Solomon are best of all. And of ointments there
   were various sorts, [42] as of roses, lilies, almonds, nard, myrrh,
   saffron, etc. and Syria, a neighboring country to Judea, was famous for
   some sorts of ointments, from whence Solomon might be supplied.

   1st, They are good in their own nature -- are an excellent composition,
   there is no ingredient in them but what is good; grace, as wrought in
   us, is called some good thing toward the Lord God of Israel; it is a
   good work, which being begun, shall be performed until the day of
   Christ.

   2dly, These ointments are both made, and applied by a good hand; for he
   that has made them,, and he that anoints us with them, is God: The
   ingredients are net only good, but they are put together by a skillful
   hand; this unction is made by, and received from the Holy One.

   3dly, They are good in their effects: they are good to make the face to
   shine, to adorn the saints, revive and refresh them; they are good to
   soften hard hearts, and heal wounded spirits; they are good to anoint
   the eyes with, and thereby recover, continue, and increase sight.

   4thly, They are good in the believers esteem; they have had experience
   of their nature and effects; and can write probatum est upon each of
   them; and therefore highly value them, and with very good reason. For,

   5thly, These ointments are exceeding rich and costly. The holy
   anointing oil was rich and costly, being made of the. principle spices,
   but not to be comps, red with these; the ingredients of which are
   preferable to gold and silver, to rubies, and all things that can be
   thought of or desired; these are precious, rich, and costly ointments
   indeed.

   6thly, Which makes them still more valuable, they never lose their
   efficacy; dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
   a stinking savor; corrupt it so that it loses its virtue, and becomes
   good for nothing; grace cannot be lost and perish in the saints; the
   anointing, which they receive, abides in them; it is. an immortal seed,
   a well of living water, springing up into eternal life; and
   notwithstanding the dead flies of their sins and corruptions, yet they
   cannot make the ointment of grace send forth a stinking savor;
   corruptions do, but grace never will; it is not indeed always in
   exercise, but it never will lose its nature or its virtue; the saints
   lamps shall never go out, being supplied with oil from that fullness of
   it that is in Christ;

   Fourthly, These ointments are said to have a savor in them; precious
   ointments have a fragrancy [43] a sweet savor in them, very delightful;
   a greater savor has the grace of Christ to a believer, who savors not
   the things of men, but the things of God; for, as the natural man, he
   receiveth not, that is, he savors not, the things of the Spirit of God,
   for they are foolishness, unsavory and insipid things unto him: these
   ointments can no more be savory to a carnal man, than food can be
   relishing to a man of a vitiated taste, or music be delightful to a
   deaf man, or colors pleasant to one that is blind; for as the one wants
   his taste, the other his hearing, and the third his sight, so this man
   wants his smelling, and therefore these ointments cannot be savory to
   him; but they are so to the believer, who has his spiritual smelling;
   now by the savor of these ointments, is intended the manifestation of
   Christ's grace unto the soul; the sense and perception which souls have
   of it, and their interest in it, fill them with pleasure and delight;
   and it was this which made the virgins love Christ, and the church so
   desirous of his company. There is an emphasis on the word thy; thy good
   ointments, none so odorous, so savory, and of so grateful a smell as
   his; as lovers used to admire and commend each others ointments, by
   which they sought to recommend themselves. [44]

   II.The church in these words declares the fragrancy and preciousness of
   Christ's name, when she says, that his name is as ointment poured
   forth. It will be proper to enquire what is intended by the name of
   Christ, and in what sense that may be said to be as ointment poured
   forth.

   1st, By the name of Christ may be meant his person, this being not an
   unusual way of speaking in the scripture; thus in Revelation 3:4. "Thou
   hast a few frames," that is, persons, "even in Sardis," etc. and in
   Matthew 12:21 "and in his name shall the Gentiles trust," that is, in
   the person of Christ shall the Gentiles trust; so here thy name is as
   ointment poured forth, that is, thy person is as delightful, grateful,
   and odorous to me, as the pouring forth a box of ointment; thou art
   altogether lovely to me, thy whole person is so; every thing in thee is
   engaging, and thou hast every thing to render thee desirable to me; all
   beauty, power, wisdom, and grace, are in thee, that it is no wonder the
   virgins love thee; for not only thy mouth, but all of thee is lovely
   and desirable.

   2dly, By it may be intended some one, or any of those names by which he
   is called. As,

   1. The Messiah or Christ, which signifies anointed. So that in
   comparing it to ointment, there may be an allusion to the signification
   of the name itself, and may more particularly point out which name is
   intended, even the name Messiah, to which Christ, in the New Testament,
   answers; which, though not very frequently met with in the Old
   Testament, yet was well known to the ancient Jews, as appears from
   their Targums, where it is made use of in upwards of sixty places, in
   which the Redeemer is treated of; [45] and as it was well known, so it
   was highly esteemed of by them; they expected him who was to redeem
   Israel, under this title and character; and when he was come, and had
   revealed himself unto some, in an exulting manner they said one to
   another, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the
   Christ; that name had been always precious to the saints, who waited
   for the consolation of Israel, and was then like a box of ointment
   poured forth, exceeding grateful, delightful, and refreshing to them.

   2. Another name by which Christ is called, and which may be said to be
   as "ointment poured forth," is the name Jesus, which signifies a
   Savior, and was given him, because he "saves his people from their
   sins." Christ is, in the everlasting gospel, revealed as a Savior; it
   is therein declared, that the design of his coming into the world was
   to save sinners, and that he has obtained eternal salvation for them,
   and is both able and willing to save the chief of them; the discovery
   the gospel makes of him is exceeding delightful and pleasant to
   awakened sinners. This name Jesus, a Savior, how sweet is it to such
   who have seen the exceeding sinfulness of sin, themselves lost and
   undone thereby, and in a perishing state and condition! the news of a
   Savior are good news and glad "tidings of great joy" unto them; the
   discovery of it is like the breaking open a box of ointment, and
   pouring it out; it at once removes the filthy stench of sin from the
   sinners nostrils, and that sadness and sorrow of heart which arise from
   the guilt of it upon the conscience.

   3. Christ's name, Immanuel, may be said to be as "ointment poured
   forth," which signifies "God with us;" and there are two things in it
   which make it like "ointment poured forth," that is, exceeding odorous
   and grateful to believers.

   (1.) That he is God; hence they know, and are well assured, that he is
   able to save them; that the work is not too heavy for him; that he has
   not undertaken that which he is not able to accomplish, which they
   would have reason to believe, if he was only a creature: from hence
   they comfortably conclude, as well they may, that all he did was
   efficacious, and answered the purposes for which it was done; as that
   his sacrifice was effectual to atone for and expiate sin; his blood to
   procure the pardon of it, and thoroughly cleanse from it; his
   righteousness to justify from all sin, and render them acceptable in
   the sight of God; and all this, because they are the sacrifice, blood,
   and righteousness of one that is God. From this name they also gather,
   that he having taken the care and charge of them, is able to keep them
   from falling; and that none is able to pluck them out of his hands, no
   more than they can separate them from his heart, which they could not
   be so assured of, was he a creature.

   (2.) Another thing which makes this name like "ointment poured forth,"
   is, that he is "God with us;" God dwelling and conversing with us, God
   in our nature, God manifest in the flesh; hence it appears, that he who
   is the great God, and our Savior, is near akin to us, and we to him;
   being "flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone," we are both of one
   and the same nature, and therefore he is not ashamed to call us
   brethren; and his assuming our nature, gives him a right, as well as
   makes him a proper person to be our Goel or Redeemer, whereby all the
   blessings, which he procured in this nature, are communicated to us,
   and not to angels; now what makes this name still more sweet, savory
   and delightful, is, that he, who is Immanuel, God with us, God in our
   nature, is, and will be on our side; and if God be with us, and for us,
   who shall be against us?

   4. Christ's name, "the Lord our righteousness," may be said to be as
   "ointment poured forth," by which he is called, Jeremiah 23:6 this is
   exceeding grateful, sweet and precious to a poor sinner; one who has
   seen his own righteousness as filthy rags, and as an unclean thing, how
   does he value Christ as the Lord his righteousness! he counts all
   things but loss and dung, in comparison of him, and desires only to be
   found in him, and in his righteousness, and not in his own; but what
   makes this so exceeding precious to him, is, because it acquits from
   all sin, and secures from all wrath and condemnation, and renders him
   spotless, unblameable, and irreproveable in the sight of God.

   5. Any, or all of those names of Christ, in Isaiah 9:6 may be said to
   be as "ointment poured forth," they being exceeding precious and
   delightful to believers; such as wonderful, counsellor, the mighty God,
   the everlasting father, and prince of peace. Christ's name "Wonderful,"
   is so; he being wonderful in his incarnation and grace, in his person
   and offices, in his works, relations and characters; this emits a sweet
   odor to believers, even like a box of ointment opened to them: and so
   is his name "counsellor;" under which character he acted from
   everlasting, consulting with the other two persons, our eternal welfare
   in the ancient council of peace; and still continues to Bear this
   character, which he makes good, by giving to us the best advice and
   most wholesome counsel, and this he does freely and faithfully: his
   name, "the mighty God," carries in it as much sweetness and comfort to
   the believer, as it does greatness and majesty; and that endearing
   title, the "everlasting Father," who, as such, loves his children with
   an everlasting love, and has made everlasting provisions for them, and
   takes everlasting care of them, fills those he stands thus related to,
   with the utmost pleasure: and that noble character, the "Prince of
   Peace," which he bears on the account of his having, obtained peace by
   "the blood of his cross," for rebellious sinners, so sweetly diffuses
   the odor of his grace, that it charms and captivates the believer's
   heart. The names of true lovers are dear to each other, to which the
   allusion is; they love to hear their names mentioned, which are as
   precious ointment, as delicious nectar. [46] Or else,

   3dly, By Christ's name, we may understand his Gospel; thus, the apostle
   Paul is said to be a chosen vessel, to bear the name of Christ before
   the Gentiles, that is, to preach his gospel to them; he was a vessel
   full of the precious ointment of the gospel, and his preaching of it
   was the pouring of it forth, which was exceeding grateful to poor
   sinners, The gospel to some, is like a box of ointment shut up; it is
   hid unto them, they know it not, it is a sealed book, a hidden mystery,
   an unpleasant story, and unsavory words; it sends forth no other savor
   than that "of death unto death;" but unto others, it is like a box of
   ointment opened, and poured forth, which diffuses and spreads a sweet
   and delightful odor abroad. The ministers of the gospel make manifest
   the savor of Christ's knowledge in every place where they are sent, and
   become to some the "savor of life unto life;" they open the box, and
   pour forth the ointment of the gospel, which coming with power, is
   received with pleasure; and being "worthy of acceptation," it sheets
   with it in the hearts of awakened sinners.

   4thly, By the name of Christ, may be intended the fame which was, and
   still is spread abroad of him: some Jewish writer, [47] expound it of a
   good name or good report, which Solomon says, "is better than precious
   ointment," (Eccl. 7:1) and then the sense is this, "such is the fame
   that is spread abroad of thee, of thy greatness and goodness, of thy
   beauties and excellencies, that even those who have only heard of thee
   by the hearing of the ear, and to whom, at present, thou art not known
   by sight, have fallen in love with thee." In the days of Christ's
   flesh, his name was renowned, his fame was spread far and near, for the
   good he did to mankind, in healing the sick, and curing all manner of
   diseases; for the surprising miracles which he wrought, and for the
   work of the ministry, which he was engaged in; his matter being
   excellent and divine, words of grace and wisdom, such as "never man
   spake;" and his manner of delivery being with power and authority: and
   now his fame is great, and an excellent report is spread abroad of him,
   through the preaching of the everlasting gospel, for the mighty
   achievements of his grace, and what his arm of Almighty power has done,
   in working out, and bringing in salvation for poor sinners; as also for
   those peculiar blessings of grace, which souls daily receive from him,
   as well as for those personal excellencies which are in him; now such a
   report going abroad of him, his name being thus "as ointment poured
   forth," the virgins love him, souls flock after him, and come unto him.
   Which brings me to consider,

   III.The influence that all this has upon the hearts of others;
   "therefore do the virgins love thee." In explaining which clause, I
   shall endeavor,

   1st, To show who are meant by the virgins.

   2dly, Give some account of the nature of their love and affection to
   Christ.

   1st, Let us consider who are intended by the virgins. Some think carnal
   professors are here meant, who are called virgins in scripture, though
   foolish ones; but their, love is not real, such as this seems to be in
   the text: others have thought that they are the uncalled and
   unconverted among the Gentiles, who are not yet espoused to Christ; but
   they rather appear to be true believers in Christ, by their love to
   him, for "faith works by love;" and, perhaps, persons lately converted
   are intended, whose love to Christ is generally warm and lively, and
   their affections strong, not having as yet met with those chills, nor
   attended with that coldness and indifference, which too often, and too
   soon befall God's children: the first love is the best and strongest,
   but oftentimes cloth not last tong warm and lively, being gradually
   chilled with the aboundings of corruption within, and the snares of the
   world without; though, perhaps, all true believers, whether of a later
   or of a longer standing, may be understood here, and may be justly
   called virgins,

   1. For their chaste and strict adherence to Christ, their only husband,
   to whom they are espoused; "I have espoused you to one husband," says
   the apostle, "that I might present you a chaste virgin to Christ;" (2
   Cor. 11:2) these being betrothed to him in righteousness, in
   loving-kindness, in mercies, and in faithfulness, know, own and
   acknowledge him as their Lord and husband, and steadfastly adhere to
   him as such; he is a head, both of eminence and influence to them; to
   him they hold, and him alone they submit unto as such; he is the Savior
   of the body, the church, and they acknowledge him to be theirs, and
   will have no other. Their language is, "Ashur shall not save us,
   neither will we say any more to the works of our hands, Ye are our
   gods." They make use of none, as the mediator between God and them,
   either as a mediator of redemption, or of intercession, but the Lord
   Jesus Christ; him they know and love, to him they have given up
   themselves, and by him they will abide, as their head and husband,
   their Savior and Mediator.

   2. For the singleness of their love and affection to Christ. Their love
   is not common to all; it is not bestowed upon any creature, but purely
   reserved for him who alone deserves it; they can every one of them say,
   "Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none on earth that I
   desire besides thee," (Ps. 73:25). Christ requires all their love, he
   will admit of no rival in it, and they are heartily willing to bestow
   it all upon him. Those who love any creature, or creature-enjoyment
   more than Christ, or equally with him, are not worthy of him, nor
   worthy to be called by the name of virgins.

   3. For their incorruptness in the doctrine of faith: this is what the
   apostle seems to have a regard to, when he declared his fervent desire
   to present the Corinthians, as a chaste virgin to Christ; he was
   jealous, lest they should be seduced through the subtlety and
   craftiness of ill-designing men, and their pure minds be corrupted and
   drawn aside "from the simplicity that is in Christ;" lest they should
   be polluted with error, and so not answer the character of virgins,
   which they had hitherto borne, and which he earnestly wished might
   continue with them. Now virgins are such, who having received, "hold
   fast the faithful word, as they have been taught;" whose souls having
   been nourished up in the words of faith, and of good doctrines and
   established therein, cannot be moved from thence, but will earnestly
   contend, and strive together "for the faith once delivered to the
   saints."

   4. For the truth and sincerity of their worship: they are such who
   "worship God in spirit and in truth;" who make the word of God, and his
   will therein revealed, the rule to act by, in all solemn and social
   worship, and not the authorities, customs, and inventions of men; and
   when they are concerned in any part of religious worship, their desires
   are, that their hearts and souls may be engaged therein, they are not
   of those who draw near to God with their mouths, and with their lips
   honor him, but have removed their hearts far from him, and their fear
   towards him, taught by the precepts of "men;" for as they have not
   committed spiritual whoredom, which is idolatry, so they serve the Lord
   with pure spirits; they desire that whatsoever they do, more especially
   in divine worship, might be done in faith, from a principle of love to
   God, and according to his word and will: these are they who are said
   not to be defiled with women, for they are virgins; "these are they
   which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth;" (Rev. 14:4) in every
   ordinance and institution of his, which he in his word has pointed out
   unto them, and marked out for them.

   5. For the purity of their lives and conversations; they hold "the
   mystery of the faith," not merely notionally and y a profession of it,
   but "in a pure conscience," and hereby "adorn the doctrine of God, our
   Savior;" their garments are, in some measure, kept from being spotted
   with the "pollutions of the world," and which they also frequently wash
   and make "white in the blood of the Lamb." Besides, that "grace of God,
   which bringeth salvation," (Titus 2:11, 12) that is, the doctrines of
   grace, which bring the news of salvation by Christ, to poor sinners,
   "teach them, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, they should
   live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;" which,
   through the mighty power of God's grace, they are in some measure
   enabled to do.

   6. For their fairness and beauty. Virgins being fair and beautiful,
   believers are therefore compared unto them; for though they are black
   in themselves, yet they are comely in Christ; though full of spots in
   themselves, yet, as considered in him, they are "all fair, and there is
   no spot" in them: through that comeliness, which he has put upon them,
   they are a perfection of beauty, and being so, are the delight of
   Christ, and wonder of angels.

   7. For their gay and costly attire; and yet modest behavior. Virgins,
   in their youthful days, if modest, though their attire is gay and
   splendid, suitable to their age; yet are of a decent and becoming
   behavior. Believers are richly attired: these virgins appear in cloth
   of gold, "in raiment of needlework," curiously wrought, which cannot be
   matched; they are decked with all kinds of ornaments, with bracelets,
   chains, rings, and jewels; they have on the glorious robe of Christ's
   righteousness, and are adorned with the various graces of the Spirit,
   which make their behavior decent and modest; for they are not proud and
   haughty, one of their ornaments being that "of a meek and quiet
   spirit;" they have low, mean; and humble thoughts of themselves;
   suitable to their character is their carriage and deportment; for
   though they are so richly clothed, and so nearly related to the King of
   kings, yet, like their Lord, are meek and lowly.

   Secondly, I shall now proceed to give some account of the love which
   these virgins bear to Christ: in doing which I shall,

   1st, Give some account of the nature of it.

   2dly, Shew from whence it arises. And,

   3dly, How it manifests itself.

   1st, Let us consider the nature and properties of it,

   1. It is a superlative love which souls bear to Christ; it: exceeds and
   excels their love to all creatures, or creature-enjoyments. Christ
   loves them above all others, and they love him more than all persons or
   things besides; of all that claim a share in their love, as none
   deserves, so none has a greater interest therein than himself,

   2. It is universal; they love all of Christ, and all that belong to
   him; they love him in his person, and in all his offices, relations,
   and characters, which he has took upon him, and by which he is pleased
   to manifest himself unto them: they love all his saints, be they high
   or low, rich or poor, and by whatsoever character or denomination, they
   are distinguished, if it appears that his grace is but wrought in their
   hearts, and they bear his image and superscription; they love all his
   commands, ordinances, and institutions; they "esteem his precepts
   concerning all things, to be right," and are not partial in their
   obedience thereunto,

   3. It is, or at least ought to be, constant and faithful, as his is to
   them, and as Jonathan's was to David: we should love him in adversity,
   as well as in prosperity, at all times; nothing should separate our
   love from Christ, as nothing can separate his love from us.

   4. It is, or ought to be, fervent and ardent; and so it is usually at
   first conversion, as has been already observed; and this is called in
   scripture, the "first love," which the church at Ephesus was blamed for
   leaving: not that she had lost her love to Christ, but the fervency
   thereof was much abated; she began to grow cold and lukewarm in her
   affections, which is too often the case of God's people, through the
   prevailing of corruptions, and an immoderate desire and pursuit after
   the things of this world; "because iniquity shall abound," says Christ,
   "the love of many shall wax cold." (Matthew 24:12)

   5. Where there is true love to Christ, it is always hearty and
   unfeigned: the virgins, true believers, love him "with all their heart,
   and with all their soul;" they love him "in sincerity," and from their
   very hearts can appeal to Him, who is the heart-searching and
   rein-trying God, as Peter did, and say, "Lord, thou knowest all things,
   thou knowest that I love thee," (John 21:17). Here is no deceit,
   dissimulation or hypocrisy in their love; though it may be sometimes
   weak and languid, yet whenever it exerts and shews itself, it is real
   and hearty; these love not "in word only," "neither in tongue, but in
   deed and in truth."

   2dly, It will be proper to enquire into the springs and causes of this
   love, and to observe from whence it arises. And,

   1. It springs and arises from a sight of Christ's loveliness: an
   unbeliever sees no beauty in Christ, wherefore he should desire him;
   there is nothing in him lovely to a carnal eye; but one that is "made
   light in the Lord," and has but a glimpse of "the King in his beauty,"
   his heart is won, his soul is ravished and drawn forth in love to him;
   he admires and desires him above all, and cannot be easy without an
   interest in him.

   2. From a view of his suitableness, as a Savior; the believer not only
   sees personal and transcendent excellencies in him, which ravish him,
   but special blessings, which are proper for him; he beholds him as
   "full of grace and truth;" he smells a sweet savor in his ointments,
   and that name Jesus, a Savior, becomes exceeding precious to him; he
   views all righteousness and strength, peace and pardon, light and life,
   joy and comfort, grace and glory, and all things appertaining: to
   salvation, every thing to make him comfortable here, and. happy
   hereafter, in Christ; and therefore says, as David did, "I will love
   thee, O Lord, my strength," (Ps. 18:1).

   3. From a sense of his love and manifestation of it to their souls; "we
   love him," says the apostle, "because he first loved us;" (1 John 4:19)
   our love is not the cause of his, but his is the cause of ours; and it
   is not merely his loving us, bur the shedding it abroad in our hearts
   by his Spirit, which draws out our love to him; for though he loved us,
   yet if he had not some way or other manifested it to us, and overcome
   our hearts with it, we should still have remained enemies to him; but
   his giving us the sense and perception of it in our hearts, is what has
   drawn us to himself, and will keep us there.

   4. From a view of union and relation to him; how can persons do
   otherwise than love him, when they see themselves so nearly united to
   him, as to be "members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones?"
   How can they but love him, when they view him standing in and filling
   up the relations of an indulgent father, a tender husband, a loving
   brother, and faithful friend unto them?

   5. This is more and more increased by enjoying communion with him; the
   more intimate a believer is with Christ, the oftener he sees him, the
   more frequent visits he receives from him, and the greater acquaintance
   and fellowship he has with him, the more he loves him; every sight of
   him, visit from him, and enjoyment of his presence, add fresh strength
   and fervency to his love; John, the beloved disciple, who leaned on
   Christ's bosom, and had intimate communion with him, had his heart
   filled with love to him, and wrote the rues; largely of it. But,

   3dly, I shall now endeavor to shew how this love manifests itself: and
   it does so,

   1. By a regard to Christ's commands and ordinances; "If ye love me,"
   says Christ, keep my commandments; for he that hath my commandments and
   keepeth them, he it is that loveth me," (John 14:15-21) that is, he
   that hath my commandments written upon his heart, by the finger of the
   Spirit, according to the tenor of the covenant of grace, and is enabled
   to keep them by the assistance of my grace and Spirit, he it is that
   shews his love to me; and therefore, as you say, you love me, shew it
   by an observance of my commands: and all that love Christ will do so,
   according to the measure of grace received; they will love the place of
   divine worship, and have a respect to all his ordinances and
   institutions; for all his tabernacles are amiable and lovely to them.

   2. By a regard, to his truths, the doctrines of the gospel; they
   receive the truth in the love of it, and value it more than their
   "necessary food;" they highly esteem the preachers of it. and cannot
   bear to hear one truth of the gospel spoken against.

   3. By a regard to his people; they love the saints, who love Christ,
   they delight in their company, and take pleasure in conversing with
   them; they are the "excellent in the earth, in whom is all their
   delight," and indeed, where there is no love to the saints, there can
   be no true love to Christ; for, as the apostle John says, "he that
   loveth not his brother, whom he hath seen, how can he love God, whom he
   hath not seen?" (1 John 4:20).

   4. By a regard to his presence; a soul that loves Christ, values the
   presence of Christ; nothing so desirable to him as that is: and when he
   has lost sight of Christ, cannot be easy without him, but seeks here
   and there until he has found him whom his soul loves: he thinks himself
   never more happy, than when he has Christ's presence, and never worse
   than when he is without it.

   5. This love manifests itself, by parting with and bearing all for
   Christ: a soul that truly loves Christ, will part with all that is near
   and clear to him, for him; he will forsake his own kindred, and his
   father's house; he counts Christ "the pearl of great price," and is
   therefore willing to quit all he has, that he may but enjoy that; he
   leaves all, as the disciples did, and follows Christ; and resolves,
   some what will, that Christ's God shall be his God, and Christ's people
   his people, and where Christ lodges he will lodge, and where he goes he
   will follow, and cleave close to him, as Ruth did to Naomi. Moreover,
   he is not only willing to leave and lose all for Christ, but also to
   bear all for him, that he is pleased to lay upon him, and call him to;
   he is willing to suffer reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions for
   the sake of him and his gospel, and to bear any cross whatever he
   thinks fit to enjoin him; all which he would never be willing to submit
   to, was not his soul filled with love to Christ; and such a love as
   this, which springs from such causes, and manifests itself in these
   ways, is exceeding grateful to Christ, as appears from chapter 4:10.

Chapter 1 Verse 4

   thy love more than wine; The upright love thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having taken notice of the excellency of Christ's
   love, the savor of his ointments, and preciousness of his name, which
   made the virgins, her companions, love him; she persists in and
   continues her request, for communion with him, in these words; in which
   we have,

   I.A petition; "draw me."

   II.An argument which she makes use of to obtain this request; "we will
   run after thee."

   III.The request granted to her, which is acknowledged by her; "the King
   hath brought me into his chambers."

   IV.The effects thereof, or the influence which this had upon her; "we
   will rejoice," etc.

   I.Here is a request or petition made by the church to Christ; "draw
   me." What she intends hereby will be proper to consider. And,

   1st, There is a powerful efficacious drawing of soul to Christ, at
   conversion, when God calls a poor sinner by his grace, brings him to
   Christ, enables him to venture upon him, and believe in him for life
   and salvation; which is what Christ speaks of in John 6:44 when he
   says, "No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me, draw
   him." A soul's coming to Christ for life, is not the produce of power
   and free-will in man, but of the grace of God in drawing, though it is
   not effected by force or compulsion; it is true, the sinner, in his
   natural estate, "is stout-hearted, and "far from righteousness," averse
   to Christ and the way of salvation by him; but by mighty grace, this
   stout heart is brought down. and made willing to submit to God's way of
   salvation; this obduracy is removed, and hardness of heart taken away
   by him, who has promised to take away the stony heart, and give an
   heart of flesh." Unconverted sinners are indeed unwilling to come to
   Christ for life; but those who belong to the election of grace, are
   made "willing in the day of Christ's power:" the manslayer did not more
   willingly flee from the avenger of blood, to the city of refuge, than a
   sinner, sensible of sin, and the danger of his state, does to Christ
   for salvation; for though a soul is not brought to Christ; by the power
   of his free-will, yet he is not brought against his will: drawing does
   not always suppose force and compulsion; there are other ways of
   drawing besides that. Thus the fame of a skillful physician draws many
   people to him; thus music draws the ear; love the heart; and pleasure
   the mind; as the poet says, "Trahit sua quemque voluptas." Nor is this
   done by mere moral suasion, which is what ministers use; knowing the
   terrors of the Lord, they persuade men: but if the mighty power of
   grace does not attend their ministry, not one soul will ever be
   converted; though they represent the joys of heaven and the terrors of
   hell, in never such a lively manner; speak in never such moving
   strains, and use the most powerful arguments to win upon souls; yet
   they will stretch out their "hands all the day, to a gainsaying and
   disobedient people;" they will return with a "who hath believed our
   report?" the arm of the Lord not being revealed unto them. God does not
   act as a mere moral cause in man's conversion; he does not only propose
   an object, and then leave the will to choose, but powerfully and
   effectually works both to will and to do of his own good pleasure; for
   this drawing is accomplished by the secret and invisible power of his
   mighty grace: and in this sense is the word used, in Judges 4:7 when
   Deborah tells Barak, that the Lord had promised, saying, "I will DRAW
   unto thee, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army,
   with his chariots and his multitudes, and I will deliver him into thine
   hands;" that is, "I will have the hearts of kings, generals, and
   captains of armies in my hands, and can turn them as the rivers of
   waters, whithersoever I will," will powerfully and invisibly work upon,
   move and incline Sisera's heart to lead his army to the river Kishon,
   where I will give an instance of my power and goodness in delivering
   him into thine hands. Thus God powerfully and invisibly works upon the
   hearts of sinners, bends their wills, slays the enmity of their minds,
   allures and draws them to Christ, "suavi omnipotentia, & omnipotente
   suavitate," "by a sweet omnipotence, and an omnipotent sweetness;" and
   this he does by revealing Christ unto them, in all his beauty and
   loveliness, discovering the love of Christ unto their souls; by the
   kind invitations of his grace, the precious and encouraging promises of
   the gospel, and the special teachings of his Spirit; all which is an
   evidence of his everlasting love; for it is, because he hath "loved
   them with an everlasting love; therefore with loving kindness" he hath
   "drawn" them; this is also a fruit of Christ's death; "I, if I be
   lifted up from the earth," says he, meaning his elevation upon the
   cross, "wilt draw all men unto me;" (John 12:32) that is, all that the
   Father hath given me, and has promised, shall be gathered to me, and
   whom I shall shed my blood for. Moreover, it is likewise an indication
   of the weakness and impotence of sinners, seeing they cannot come
   unless they are drawn; and sufficiently destroys the notion which
   advances the free-will and power of the creature in conversion: but I
   apprehend that this is not the drawing intended in this petition, for
   thus the church had been already drawn.

   The Septuagint read it, "They have drawn thee: at the smell of thine
   Ointments, will we run"; [48] that is, the virgins have loved thee, and
   shewn their love to thee; and this has so took with thine heart, that
   it has drawn thee after them, they have thy company, which I want; but
   by the smell of those ointments, which thou carriest about with thee,
   I, and others, will run after thee, till we find thee: so that Christ,
   according to this version and sense of the words, is the person drawn,
   and not the person petitioned to, to draw; though the latter seems best
   to agree both with the Hebrew text, and the sense of the words.

   R. Aben Ezra thinks that they are the words of the virgins, who, every
   one of them, desire, saying, "draw me;" we," every one of us, "will run
   after thee;" but they seem rather to be the words of the church,
   desirous of more intimate communion with Christ; for there is,

   2dly, A drawing to nearer communion with Christ, which believers
   oftentimes want, and are desirous of, and which the church had enjoyed;
   as appears from the following clause in this verse; in which she
   declares that "the king had brought her into his chambers," where he
   conversed with her, and disclosed the secrets of his heart to her: now
   this petition of hers for nearer communion with him, supposes,

   1. A distance between Christ and her; not a distance with regard to
   union; for believers being one with Christ, they never are, nor can be
   distanced from him; they are always in this sense, "a people near unto
   the Lord;" nor is there a distance of affection, for "having loved his
   own, which were in the world, he loves them to the end;" they can never
   be separated from his love, seeing they are engraven as a seal upon his
   heart: but this is a distance as to communion; and, in this sense,
   Christ does sometimes stand at a distance, and hides himself from his
   people; as appears by their frequent complaints of it, they then
   thinking themselves forsaken and. forgotten by him.

   2. This petition shews her uneasiness in this condition, and therefore
   she says, "draw me;" not but that sometimes believers are lukewarm and
   indifferent; for falling asleep upon a bed of security, they become
   insensible of their condition, and therefore unconcerned about it; but
   when they are awakened, and find their beloved gone, their souls are
   troubled, and being impatient of delay, though in the night, as the
   church in chapter 3 arise from their beds, and in "the streets and
   broad ways" seek him, whom their souls love.

   3. This request shews the sense she had of her own inability to attain
   to a state of nearer communion with him: "when he hides his face, who
   can behold him?" when he stands at a distance, who can come near him?
   if he is pleased to withdraw his presence, there is no commanding it;
   the light of his countenance, the enjoyment of his presence, and
   fellowship with him, are as much the instances of his distinguishing
   and sovereign grace, and as much depend upon his sovereign pleasure, as
   the first workings of grace itself; we can no more enjoy the one at
   pleasure, than we could effect the other; the same Spirit that wrought
   grace in us at first, must give us access into Christ's presence; we
   need now the same bands and cords of love to draw us to Christ, as then
   we did.

   4. It signifies the apprehension she seems to have of danger; draw me,
   or I shall be drawn away: believers may be sometimes under fearful
   apprehensions of being drawn away by the corruptions of their nature,
   the snares of the world, and the temptations of Satan; though they can
   never be drawn totally and finally from Christ. He has, by the cords of
   love, drawn them to himself; and though they may not always experience
   it, yet he will never leave his people till he has brought them safe to
   glory.

   5. It shews that high value and esteem she had for communion with
   Christ, which makes her so earnestly importune that blessing, and use
   such pressing and repeated instances for the enjoyment of it; this was
   the "one thing" she earnestly desired and sought for, yea, preferred to
   all other enjoyments. Moreover,

   II.Here is an argument made use of to obtain this request; "We will run
   after thee:" or else it may be considered as the end of her asking this
   favor; "draw me," that we may "run after thee." [49] Lord, do thou
   draw, that we may run, which we cannot do, unless thou dost; but if
   thou wilt, we shall run after thee. Here is a change of persons in
   these words; first she says, draw me, and then we will run after thee;
   by whom are meant, she, and the virgins her companions; the church, and
   particular members: every one in their stations would act with more
   life and vigor upon such drawings. "We will run after thee;" this is
   not a running to Christ, as sinners do under apprehension of danger, as
   to a city of refuge, and saints, as to a place of protection, safety
   and security; but this is a running after him: Christ is the
   fore-runner who has gone before us, and left us an example, both in
   doing and suffering, as the fulfiller of righteousness, and the great
   captain of our salvation; and we must follow him the Lamb,
   whithersoever he goeth; and not only follow, but run. Our life is
   frequently, in scripture, called a race; Christ is the mark we must
   press after; heaven is the prize we should have in view; and the way or
   stadium in which we should run, are Christ's commandments; though our
   running therein, or performing them, is not the cause of our obtaining
   the prize; for "it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,
   but of God that sheweth mercy;" yet running herein is our duty; which
   supposes,

   1st, Cheerfulness, readiness, and willingness; then, says David, "will
   I run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart;"
   (Ps. 119:32) that is, I shall observe them more cheerfully, readily and
   willingly; it will remove that backwardness that is in me to duty.

   2dly, Swiftness; "I made haste, and delayed not, to keen thy
   commandments," (Ps. 119:60) says the same psalmist such obedience as
   this, though far more perfectly than we are capable of, do the angels
   perform in heaven.

   3dly, Strength; and this we have not; but there is fullness of it with
   Christ; who, whilst we are waiting on him, is pleased to renew our
   strength, so that we "mount up with wings as eagles, and run and are
   not weary, and walk and do not faint." Now this is the effect of that
   drawing, without which there is no running; we cannot set one step
   forward unless he speak to us, much less can we run, unless he draw us.

   III.Here is an account of the request being granted, which she observes
   with pleasure, "the King hath brought me into his chambers;" though
   others read it, "Let the King bring me, [50] or, O! that the King would
   bring me, etc." and so take it as a continuation of her desires after
   communion with Christ; but this is for want of knowledge in the Hebrew
   language, as Mercer observes: others think that the past tense is put
   for the future, and so read it, "The King shall or wilt bring me," etc
   as being expressive of her faith, that she should enjoy what she was
   desirous of. Junius renders it, "When the King shall have brought me,"
   etc. and so carries in it the nature of a promise, as to her and her
   virgins future behavior upon the enjoyment of such a blessing; though I
   think it is much better rendered by our translators, "The King hath
   brought me," etc. and so signifies her enjoyment of the mercy she
   sought after. Wherein are three things to be considered,

   1st, Who this King is, that brought her into his chambers.

   2dly, What chambers those are, which he brought her into.

   3dly, What is meant by his bringing there, or what this phrase is
   expressive of.

   1st, Who this King is, not Solomon, for "a greater than Solomon is
   here," but the Lord Jesus Christ, who is kat ejxoch&lt;ouv by way of
   eminency, called, "The King": [51] who is the King of the whole world,
   the King of the kings of the world, and the king of saints; he has, as
   he is God, an universal empire over all worlds, heaven, earth, and
   hell; and, as Mediator, has a kingdom given him by his Father, which he
   has purchased with his own blood, and by the mighty conquests of his
   grace, has brought into subjection to himself; in this kingdom he
   enacts laws for the subjects thereof, by which they are governed and
   kept in order; he subdues all their enemies, sin, Satan, and the world,
   protects them from all dangers; encourages his loyal and faithful
   subjects; courteously receives them, graciously takes notice of all
   their petitions, and supplies them with every thing needful for them:
   now this kingdom, which Christ, as Mediator, is possessed of, is of a
   spiritual nature, and managed in a spiritual way; it is kept in peace,
   being governed in wisdom and righteousness; and will continue for ever,
   when all other rule and authority shall be thrown down. But,

   2dly, What chambers are these which this king is said to bring her
   into? Not the temple, into which Solomon introduced the people of
   Israel, which is the sense [52] some give of the words; though there
   may be an [53] allusion to the temple, and the chambers thereof, of
   which mention is made, 1 Chronicles 28:11, 12 and more especially to
   the holy of holies, which was inaccessible to any but the high priest;
   as that, which was typified by it, is to any but Christ the high
   priest, and those who belong to him, to whom he gives access, and who
   have boldness and liberty to enter into the holiest of all, by the
   blood of Jesus: nor do I think that by them are meant those everlasting
   mansions of peace and rest, which are in Christ's Father's house, which
   he is preparing for his spouse, and bride, and into which he, ere long,
   will introduce her, where they will keep an everlasting nuptial feast;
   for at present she could not say, that she was brought thither, though
   she might be assured of it, that she should, by those kind intimations
   of his love unto her; therefore it seems better to understand them
   either,

   1. Of those chambers of intimate communion and fellowship; which Christ
   sometimes brings his people into, and of which they are exceeding
   desirous: this inestimable blessing Christ frequently grants to his
   people in his ordinances; for he does not always suffer them to stand
   without, in the outer courts, but sometimes takes them into his inner
   chambers, where he discloses the secrets of his heart unto them, gives
   evident intimations of his love, and fills their souls with divine
   consolation: or else,

   2. The doctrines of the gospel, which contain the unsearchable riches
   of Christ, and the mysteries of his grace) which he brings his people
   gradually into, and shews them those things which eye hath not seen,
   neither hath ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived of: [54] He took
   me, as if she should say, into his chambers, and there more thoroughly
   instructed me into his mind and will; gave me to know more fully the
   mysteries of the kingdom; opened all the treasures of his grace, and
   shewed me all his riches, and glory contained therein. Now this sense
   suits well with a practice much used by the Jews, who frequently taught
   in chambers, where they also met together to converse about, and
   determine matters in religion, as fully appears from their writings;
   [55] and we have many hints in the New Testament, which confirm it; it
   was in such a chamber that Christ kept the passover, and instituted the
   Lord's Supper, and gave there a discovery of the nature of his death
   and sufferings to his disciples: in such a room the disciples met
   together, after his ascension; and in such an one Paul preached till
   midnight. But,

   3dly, What is meant by being brought into these chambers; or what does
   this phrase import, or express?

   1. On Christ's part.

   (1.) An acknowledgement of her to be his bride; he having espoused her
   to himself, and solemnized the marriage among her friends, which was
   the Jewish custom, takes her home to himself as his spouse and bride,
   to live and converse with him; leads her into his chambers, and there
   unlocks all his treasures; shews her all his riches and glory, and puts
   her into the possession of them.

   (2.) It imports wonderful condescension in him, that he, who is the
   King of kings, should vouchsafe to regard such a worthless creature, as
   the church is in herself; and much more espouse her to himself, and in
   such a kind, loving and familiar manner, give her access to his person,
   and all he has, and grant her such intimate communion and fellowship
   with him.

   (3.) It shews us, that all our nearness to, and communion with God, are
   in and through Christ; it is he that gives us "access into the grace
   wherein we stand," and leads us into the presence of his Father; he is
   our only way of access unto him, and acceptance with him.

   2. On her part; they being her words, shew,

   (1.) That she does not ascribe this to herself, but to his powerful and
   efficacious grace; she was conscious of her own inability, and
   therefore makes application to him, and, having obtained her desires,
   acknowledges it to the glory of his grace; who "brought, or caused her
   to come," as the [56] word may be rendered, notwithstanding all
   difficulties and obstructions which lay in the way.

   (2.) This she does with thankfulness, in an exulting manner, as this
   way of speaking testifies, and the following words declare: what was
   before matter of prayer, is now the subject of praise; she owns, with
   gratitude, as became her, the mercy she had received.

   (3.) It seems to be in a boasting way and manner that she speaks.
   Believers are allowed to glory in the Lord, and boast of what he has
   done for them, and manifests to them, that his grace may be magnified,
   others take notice of it, and they be encouraged in their addresses to
   him: the church here might have an eye to the virgins or daughters of
   Jerusalem.

   IV.We have, in these words, the effects or consequences of the church's
   enjoying this valuable blessing, as they appear in her or her members,
   or her daughters, "the virgins."

   1st, Gladness and rejoicing in Christ; "we will be glad and rejoice in
   thee." The several clauses of this text, some think, should be
   considered thus; [57] the first clause, "Draw me," as the words of the
   church; the next, "We will run after thee," the chorus of the virgins;
   then the church again says, "The King hath brought me into his
   chambers;" and after that the virgins, "We will be glad, etc." but
   whether the church, or the virgins, or both, are here intended, it is
   certain, that this is the language of believers, of whose joy Christ is
   the object: they rejoice, not in themselves, neither in their works,
   nor graces, nor frames, but in the Lord Jesus Christ: this is one part
   of the character which the apostle gives of true believers; they are
   such who "rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the
   flesh," (Phil. 3:3).

   1. They rejoice in his person, in his greatness, fitness, fullness, and
   glory, as he is God and man in one person; for, being so, he is able to
   be their Savior, a proper person to be a Mediator, has all fullness of
   grace treasured up in him, and appears to be "the brightness of his
   Father's glory, and the express image of his person;" a view of, and
   communion with, such an one, must needs fill the believer with "a joy
   unspeakable and full of glory,"

   2. They rejoice in what he has done for them; he is the Lord Jehovah,
   "who has done great things for them, whereof they are glad;" he engaged
   as their surety in the everlasting covenant, and in the "fullness of
   time" assumed their nature, finished and made reconciliation for their
   sins, satisfied Divine Justice, fulfilled a righteous law, brought in
   and clothed them with an everlasting righteousness, procured the pardon
   of all their sins; and, in short, has secured all grace and glory for
   them; and when they consider all this, they cannot but be glad and
   rejoice in him.

   3. They rejoice also in what he is unto them, as well as in what he has
   done for them; he stands in and fills up all relations to them; he is
   their "everlasting Father," their kind and loving brother, their tender
   and indulgent husband, their constant and faithful friend, and indeed,
   their "all in all;" he is every thing unto them, for he "of God is made
   unto them, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption;" and
   when they consider him under all these endearing characters and
   relations, it is no wonder that they are heard to say, "I will greatly
   rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in the God of my
   salvation, etc."

   2dly, Another effect of the church enjoying such intimate communion
   with Christ, is a remembrance of his love; "We will remember thy love
   more than wine." I have already, on verse 2. shewn you the
   preferableness of Christ's love to wine and shall not here repeat it,
   but only shew,

   1. What it is to remember Christ's love.

   2. Why we should, and why every believer will do so.

   1. What it is to remember it.

   (1.) It is so to record it in our minds, as not to forget it we should,
   with David, call upon our "souls, and all that is within us, to bless
   his holy name, and forget not all his benefits;" (Ps. 103:1, 2) and
   more especially we should not forget his love, from whence they all
   spring.

   (2.) We should often meditate upon it; which would not only serve to
   advance the glory of divine love; but would sweetly ravish our souls,
   raise our affections, inflame our love, and quicken our faith.

   (3.) We should constantly observe that ordinance, which Christ has
   appointed for this purpose, namely, the Lord's Supper; it being his
   design in the institution of it, that we should remember him, his
   broken body and precious blood, and particularly his special love,
   which appeared in all.

   (4.) We should so remember it, as to have our desires more strongly
   after it, and our affections more firmly fixed upon it: Christ's love
   is excellent and valuable; it is preferable to life itself, and all the
   comforts of it; and a frequent revolving it in our minds will enlarge
   our desires after a greater knowledge of it, and heighten our value
   for, and esteem of it.

   (5.) We should so remember it, as to exercise faith in it; for it will
   bring us but little comfort, and do us but little service, unless we
   can, in some measure, appropriate it to ourselves, saying, with the
   apostle, "He hath loved me, and hath given himself for me;" it will
   afford us no solid joy and comfort, that he has loved others, if we
   have no reason to hope and believe that he hath loved us; for it is
   faith's viewing a peculiar interest in this love, that fixes a sense of
   it more firmly upon the mind.

   (6.) It then appears, that this is uppermost in our minds, when we
   speak and make mention of it to others; and, indeed, that should be the
   subject of our discourse now, which will be the delightful theme of
   glorified saints to all eternity. But,

   2. Why should we, and why will every believer remember Christ's love,
   value and esteem it more than wine?

   1. Because it is worthy of remembrance, in its own nature, and in its
   effects, as has been already shewn; it is "better than wine;" it is
   great and glorious, stupendous and unparalleled, matchless and
   boundless, everlasting and unchangeable; it "passeth knowledge, and is
   the source and spring of all the grace we now receive, and of all the
   glory we are expectants of."

   2. It would be ungrateful in us not to remember it; should we be
   unmindful of, and forget this love, and the benefits which spring from
   it, we should be justly chargeable with the vile sin of ingratitude;
   and it might be very pertinently returned upon us, what Absalom said to
   Hushai, "Is this thy kindness to thy friend?" (2 Sam. 16:17).

   3. Because he hath remembered us, and that "in our low estate, because
   his mercy endureth for ever;" even when we were in the depths of sin
   and misery, could not help ourselves, and were so far from having any
   love to him, that we were in open rebellion against him; yet such was
   his amazing love to us, that he raised us "beggars from the dunghill,
   washed us from our sins in his own blood," and made "us kings and
   priests to God and his Father; and shall we not remember? can we be
   forgetful of this love?

   4. A remembrance of it promotes our own comfort and edification, serves
   to make sin odious and detestable, and is oftentimes useful to excite
   and revive grace, to banish our doubts and fears, and make the person
   of Christ more precious to us.

   3dly, Another effect or consequence of the church's being brought into
   the chambers of near fellowship and communion with Christ, is, that the
   love of his church and people is the more drawn forth to him, who here
   go under the character of upright ones, "the upright love thee;" or,
   according to the Hebrew text, "uprightnesses love thee;" [58] the
   abstract for the concrete; which intends upright men, or men of
   uprightness, as being the persons who love Christ; unless with R. Sol.
   Jarchi, we take it to be expressive of the sincerity of their love, and
   so read it, "in uprightnesses, or with an uptight love they love thee:"
   R. Aben Ezra thinks it is the adjective of wine, before-mentioned, and
   intends the excellency, sweetness, and incorruptness of it, as in
   chapter 7:9 and the sense then is this, "we will remember thy love more
   than wine, yea, more than uptight wine," or wine that goes down
   sweetly, "do they love thee:" though I rather think it intends the
   character of the persons who love Christ. I have already, on the
   preceding verse, shewn the nature of this love, with which souls love
   Christ, from whence it springs, and how it manifests itself; and shall
   now only consider the character of those persons who are here said to
   love him, namely, upright ones; and they are,

   1. Such who are said to be "upright in heart," of whom mention is made
   in Psalm 124:4. "Do good, O Lord, to them that be good, and to them
   that are upright in their hearts;" such are they who have a work of
   grace wrought upon their souls; whose hearts are right with God, and
   desire to worship him with their whole hearts; who live by faith on
   Christ, and his righteousness, and whose words and actions are without
   dissimulation; such are "Israelites indeed, in whom there is no guile."

   2. Who are of an upright conversation, as in Psalm 37:14. These are
   they who walk according to the rule of God's word; they are not partial
   in their observance of his commands, but have a regard to them all;
   they make a conscience of avoiding lesser, as well as greater sins; and
   in all their obedience to the divine will, seek the honor and glory of
   God; and what they do, they do in faith, and from a principle of love
   to God and Christ. Junius understands this clause of the sincerity and
   uprightness of the love of the church and her friends to Christ, and
   reads it in connection with the former thus, "We will remember thy love
   more than wine, and whosoever most uprightly love thee;" [59] that is,
   whoever bear a sincere affection to thee will do the same.

Chapter 1 Verse 5

   I am black, but comely; O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
   as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church in the preceding verses had directed her speech to
   Christ, where we have observed the request she makes, and the success
   of it, and also the comfortable and grateful frame of Spirit produced
   by it: here she turns herself to "the daughters of Jerusalem," and
   gives an account of her person and state, and delivers her mind to them
   in this and the following verse. Wherein may be considered,

   I.The persons she speaks to, "the daughters of Jerusalem."

   II.The character which she gives of her herself.

   III.The reason of her so doing.

   I.The persons she speaks to, are "the daughters of Jerusalem:" and
   seeing these are frequently mentioned in this Song, it will be
   necessary to consider who are meant by them. R. Sol. Jarchi would have
   them to be the Gentiles, who, he says, are so called, because Jerusalem
   shall be the metropolis of all nations, according to Ezekiel 16:61. "I
   will give them unto thee for daughters;" and that they are, in the same
   sense, "the daughters of Jerusalem," as the towns of Ekron are called
   in Joshua 15:45. "the daughters of Ekron; but it is much better to
   understand them of particular churches, of which, "Jerusalem that is
   above," or that "general assembly, and church of the first-born, whose
   names are written in heaven," is the mother; though I rather think,
   young converts are intended by them, who, perhaps, had not as yet
   joined themselves to the church, though they had a very great respect
   for her, as is manifest from chapter 5:9 they seem to be very weak, and
   their knowledge of Christ but small, yet desirous of knowing him and
   seeking him with her. (See chapters 5:8 and 6:1) And it is very
   evident, that not only the church, but Christ also, had a very great
   respect for them, from chapter 3:9, 10, 11. They were her friends and
   companions, distinct from mother's children, mentioned in the following
   verse, and were far from being enemies either to Christ or his church.

   II.To these persons she gives a character of herself.

   1st, She makes a concession that she was black.

   2dly, Notwithstanding asserts that she is comely. And,

   3dly, Uses some similes to express both by, "as the tents of Kedar, the
   curtains of Solomon."

   1st, She ingenuously and frankly acknowledges that she was black. This
   is not to be understood literally of Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon
   had married; and whose mother, Grotius conjectures, might be an
   Arabian, and so these words be expressive of her natural complexion;
   but this is not intended, nor, perhaps, is there so much as an allusion
   to it; but rather to a shepherdess, or keeper of vineyards, made black
   by lying in the fields, as the following verse seems to intimate. The
   Targum applies it to the people of Israel, when they made the calf, and
   says, that then "their faces became as black as the Ethiopians, that
   dwell in the tents of Kedar; but when they returned, by repentance, and
   were forgiven, the brightness of the glory of their countenances was
   increased, as the angels:" but the words are expressive of the
   spiritual estate and complexion of the church of Christ, and of all
   believers in him; who may be said to be black, and comely; black by
   sin, comely by grace: [60] Black,

   1. Upon the account of the many spots, blemishes, and infirmities; for
   though they are fair and spotless, as considered in Christ, yet they
   are black and full of spots, as considered in themselves; sin dwells in
   them and they are sometimes overcome, and carried captive by it; it is
   always present with them; this body of sin and death, they carry about
   as their burden; neither will they be rid of it in this life; for "if
   we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not
   in us"; the most holy and righteous man on earth is not without it;
   every one is both disturbed and defiled with it, and therefore in this
   sense may be said to be black; and so the [61] Jewish doctors expound
   it, of the sinful actions and evil works of the congregation of Israel.

   2. The church of Christ may be said to be black, oftentimes on the
   account of those swarms of hypocrites and heretics that appear in it;
   there have always been more or less of them in the church, in all ages,
   which have been "spots in their feasts of charity." There was a Cain in
   Adam's family, a Ham in Noah's, an Ishmael in Abraham's, an Esau in
   Isaac's, and a Judas among Christ's disciples; these goats have always
   been among Christ's sheep, these tares grow up among his wheat, and
   will do so, till he shall divide the sheep from the goats, and take his
   fan in his hand, and thoroughly purge his floor. Now upon the account
   of these, and the several heresies, schisms, and divisions, which
   frequently arise, and are made in the church of Christ, she may be said
   to be black: And also,

   3. By reason of the persecutions and reproaches of the world, which the
   church of Christ, and all believers in him sustain; for they that "will
   live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution" of one kind or
   another; if not confiscation of goods, fines, imprisonments, racks,
   tortures, yea death itself, which in some ages of the world, have been
   the lot of God's children, yet, at least, loss of their good name,
   credit, and reputation; for if they are loved by Christ, they must
   expect to be hated by men; if they have peace in him, in the world they
   must have tribulation; they may be sure of being vilified by the world,
   and backbited and reproached by carnal professors; and this is what the
   church seems to ascribe her blackness to, in the following verse. So in
   Zohar, [62] this blackness is, by the Jews, expounded of the captivity
   of the people of Israel.

   4. She may be said to be black, with sorrow and mourning; black color
   not only being the habit of mourners, but does also, in scripture,
   express grief and sorrow itself. See Jeremiah 8:21 and Jeremiah 14:2.
   The sins and corruptions of God's people, oftentimes put them in this
   mourning habit; as David says, when he was under a sense of his
   manifold iniquities, "I go mourning all the day long," (Ps. 38:6) or
   nearer the Hebrew, "I go in black all the day long;" [63] the coldness,
   hypocrisy, and formality of professors, give them much uneasiness: the
   many errors and heresies among them, and the persecutions and
   reproaches, both of the world and carnal professors, produce this black
   hue and mournful color.

   5. They are black in the eyes of the world, which indeed is no wonder;
   for the men of the world see no beauty nor comeliness in Christ
   himself, and therefore not any in his people; they being, in their
   eyes, mean, abject, and contemptible, despised by them, and accounted
   as the refuse and "off-scouring of all things." But notwithstanding all
   this she could say,

   2dly, That she was comely, that is, beautiful and desireable, [64]
   having graceful features, and a just symmetry and proportion. Now the
   church, and every believer in Christ, may be said to be comely.

   1. By the imputation of Christ's righteousness, whereby they are
   justified from all sin, and stand spotless and irreprovable in God's
   sight; their own righteousness is as filthy rags, and rather detracts
   from, than adds to their comeliness; but Christ's righteousness being
   that "fine linen, clean, and white," with which being arrayed, they are
   "adorned as a bride for her husband," they appear perfectly comely
   through the comeliness which Christ has put upon them; they are no ways
   comely in themselves, but in Christ they are a perfection of beauty.

   2. By the sanctifying grace of the Spirit, whereby they are made new
   creatures; Christ is formed in their hearts, and they are conformed to
   him, who is the "first born among many brethren;" his image is
   impressed upon them, and all the parts of the new man are in a just
   proportion in them, though not grown up to their perfection; and thus
   being made partakers of the divine nature, and appearing in the
   beauties of holiness, they are all glorious and comely within.

   3. Believers are so in their church-state, having fellowship with
   Christ, and with one another, walking together in, and according to the
   commands and ordinances of Christ Jesus: a church of Christ, in gospel
   order, is beautiful for situation; all her tabernacles are amiable and
   lovely; and enjoying the presence of Christ in them, is "beautiful as
   Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, and terrible as an army with banners." O
   how comely are the saints in their goings in Zion! a more lovely sight
   than this can scarce be seen; they are then like a "company of horses
   in Pharaoh's chariots."

   4. However black believers may be in the eyes of the world, they are
   certainly comely in the eyes of Christ; who often, in this song, calls
   his church his "fair one," and "the fairest among women;" however
   undesirable she was to others, she was very desirable to him; her eyes,
   cheeks, lips, teeth, head, hair, neck, etc. are commended and praised
   by him; so much beauty and comeliness appeared in her, that his heart
   was even ravished with her; and so long as he thinks her comely, it
   matters not what opinion others entertain of her.

   3dly, She makes use of some similes to express both her blackness and
   her comeliness, "as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon."
   Some think [65] that these refer to both parts of her character; and
   suppose that the tents of Kedar, though they were mean and abject
   without, yet were full of wealth and riches within; and a number of
   them together made a fine appearance, as Dr. Shaw relates they now do;
   [66] and that Solomon's curtains or hangings had an outward covering,
   which was not so rich and valuable as that within; and so are both
   designed by the church to represent unto us, that though she was mean
   and abject in the eyes of the world, yet she was rich, glorious, and
   beautiful within: the outside of a believer is only seen by the world,
   and they judge of him accordingly; his inside is hid from them, as the
   riches of Kedar's tents, and the fineness of Solomon's curtains were
   from those who viewed the outside only; though I rather think her
   blackness is designed by the one, and her comeliness by the other.

   1. For her blackness she compares herself to the tents of Kedar. Kedar
   was the second son of Ishmael (Gen. 24:13), whose posterity dwelt in
   the deserts of Arabia (Isa. 42:11), and their employment being to feed
   cattle (Isa. 60:7), they dwelt in tents (Ps. 120:4, 5), which were made
   of hair-cloth, and that of goats hair; which being always exposed to
   the sun and rain, were very black, looked very mean and contemptible:
   [67] they had no other houses but these; and because they always, dwelt
   in them, removing and pitching them at pleasure, therefore they were
   called Scenites. [68] Now the church compares herself to these mean,
   black and despicable tents, on the account of the sins and infirmities
   of herself, the carnality and hypocrisy of others, the many errors and
   heresies she was vexed with, as well as the persecutions and reproaches
   of men, which oftentimes oppressed her, as has been already observed.

   2. For her comeliness, she compares herself to the curtains of Solomon.
   The Septuagint read it, wjv derreiv Salwmw&gt;n, as the skins of
   Solomon; and so the Vulgate Latin likewise; which version Gilbert
   Foliot [69] following, in his Exposition of this place, says, it is not
   to be understood of the skins of sheep, goats, or any other animal, but
   of the very skin of Solomon himself; who being a rich king, and living
   deliciously, he supposes was very comely and beautiful; to whose fine
   skin he thinks the church here compares herself, to set forth her
   comeliness: but this is much better referred by Alcuin, his countryman,
   to the skins of slain beasts, of which, he thinks, Solomon made tents
   for himself; though it seems rather to intend those rich hangings of
   tapestry, which Solomon had, either about his bed, or in the several
   apartments of his house; which, no doubt, were very rich, costly, and
   glorious, he being so great and wealthy a prince: or his garments, as
   Theodoret, see Matthew 6:29; and therefore the church, on the account
   of her perfect comeliness, thro" Christ's righteousness put upon her,
   and the curious and embroidered work of the Spirit of God in her, as
   also her walk in gospel-order, compares herself to these curtains or
   hangings. Moreover, by a metonymy, may be understood, both in this and
   the preceding comparison, the persons who dwelt in Kedar's tents, and
   Solomon's courtiers, who lived in those apartments of his which were so
   richly hung; the former being black, and the latter dwelling in the
   palace of a wealthy king, and faring deliciously, were no doubt, plump
   and comely: though neither Solomon nor any of his courtiers, could come
   near the church for beauty and comeliness; and to this sense agrees
   Junius's version of the text. [70] But,

   III.Let us now consider the reason of her giving this account of
   herself to the daughters of Jerusalem: her design seems to be to
   obviate what might be objected by, and remove whatever might be
   discouraging in her to the daughters of Jerusalem, those young
   converts; they might object to her, Thou talkest of being brought into
   the king's chambers, and having nearness of access unto him, how can it
   be, that one so black as thou art, should be taken notice of by so
   great a person, and have such nearness to him, who appears to be so
   mean and so unworthy thereof? To this she answers, by granting, that
   she was black in herself, but yet was comely, through his comeliness;
   in him she was prepared as a bride adorned for her husband; and it was
   this that gave her the favor and acceptance she had with him.

   Again, It might be objected, How canst thou be cheerful, when thou art
   so black, loaded with persecutions and afflictions, and hated and
   despised by all? This she obviates by observing, that the world could
   not see her inward glory, and therefore passed a wrong judgment upon
   her; and that the unseen glory, riches, beauty, and perfection in
   Christ, supported her under all reflections, persecutions, and
   reproaches.

   Also the sins and infirmities which they saw in her, as well as the
   sufferings she was exposed unto, might stumble those young converts,
   and be a means to deter them from the ways of Christ, and joining with
   his church and people; and seeing there was danger of this, therefore
   she informs them of her beauty as well as of her blackness; of her
   grace, as welt as of her corruptions; of her glory, as well as of her
   sufferings; and in doing this, her design is to engage and encourage
   them to go with her; in all which, she discovers her strength of faith
   in Christ, and his righteousness, notwithstanding all her sins and
   sufferings; of which she gives a farther account in the following
   verse.

Chapter 1 Verse 6

   Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath
   looked upon me: My mother's children were angry with me; they
   made me the keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard
   have I not kept.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church, here continues her discourse to the daughters of
   Jerusalem: And,

   I.Desires of them, not to look upon her.

   II.Gives a reason why she would not have them do so, because I am
   black; of which blackness she assigns several causes; some of which are
   mot, near, others more remote.

   1st, "Because the sun had looked upon her."

   2dly, "Her mother's children were angry with her."

   3dly, "They had made her the keeper of the vineyards."

   4thly, This occasioned a neglect of her own; mine own vineyard have I
   not kept; all which produced this blackness in her; for it was not her
   true and native color.

   I.She desires the daughters of Jerusalem not to look upon her; which
   may be understood, either, 1. Of a look of scorn and disdain: [71] she
   was now in suffering circumstances, surrounded with a variety of
   enemies, exposed to a multitude of troubles, and liable to many
   failings and infirmities; for which reasons she might be jealous of
   falling under their scorn and contempt, and therefore says, Look not
   upon me. The meanness, poverty, and sufferings of the saints, render
   them contemptible to the world; and the failures and imperfections of
   their lives are oftentimes thrown in their teeth, and this, too often,
   by professors themselves; but this we should be very careful of, that
   we do not treat our fellow-Christians after such a manner: we should be
   far from slighting a believer under sufferings, or carrying with a
   disdainful air to a fallen saint; for we should consider, that we also
   are in the body, and liable to the same temptations. Or else, 2. It
   means a curious and prying look into her failings and infirmities;
   conscious she was to herself of them, but knew it was not their duty,
   tho' perhaps they too often made it their business, to look into them.
   There are some who are never better, than when thus employed, in
   exposing of the saints; they watch for their haltings, and are glad to
   report and spread a tale of the infirmities of their brethren; their
   eyes pierce like vultures, and fasten upon nothing else but corruption:
   but such a curious, prying look as this, is condemned by Christ
   (Matthew 7:3, 4, 5). "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy
   brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye,"
   etc. If God did as strictly observe and mark our iniquities, as we are
   too apt to mark one another's, what would become of us! This
   consideration should deter us from a practice so vile in itself, so
   dishonorable to religion, and which is so highly resented by Christ. 3.
   It may also signify a looking with delight and pleasure at her
   afflictions and falls, which, perhaps, she was suspicious of: this was
   what Edom was blamed for, in Obadiah v. 12, 13. "but thou shouldest not
   have looked on the day of thy brother," that is, with joy and pleasure,
   as the following words shew; "neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over
   the children of Judah, in the day of their destruction," etc. believers
   should be so far from such a temper as this is, that they should rather
   sympathize with them in their sufferings and fails, than triumph over
   them; for "let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall."
   Or, 4. She would not have them look upon her as persons astonished and
   amazed at her present sufferings, as though some strange and
   unaccountable thing had happened to her; for they need not be
   surprised, when they consider, that Christ, her head and husband, the
   holy and the harmless one, was treated after the same, yea, after a
   much worse manner; that the sufferings which she underwent, were but
   what were appointed for her, and would all end in God's glory, and her
   own good; therefore she would have them not be startled at them, nor be
   discouraged by them from joining with her. 5. She would have them not
   to look at her blackness only, but also at her beauty; it is true, she
   was black in herself, and that she acknowledges; but then she was
   comely in Christ, and that she would have them take notice of, as well
   as the other: she would have them look upon Christ, who is "white and
   ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand," who is altogether lovely and
   exceeding comely, and consider her in him, and not as she was in
   herself, for that might be frightening and discouraging to them.

   II.She proceeds to give the reason why she would not have them look
   upon her, because, says she, "I am black;" she had said this before;
   but here she uses the same word in another form, which some think is to
   diminish the signification of it, and that she was not so black as they
   thought her to be, or had represented her; and read it "blackish," or
   "somewhat black"; [72] though the doubling of the radicals seems rather
   to increase the signification, as in other places (see Ps. 45:5;
   Proverbs 8:31), and therefore should be read, "because I am very black
   or exceeding black; [73] and this she here mentions again with this
   addition, that she might have an opportunity to give an account of the
   particular reasons thereof; which reasons are as follow:

   1st, She declares, that one reason of her blackness was, "because the
   sun had looked upon her." The Ethiopic version has it, "because the sun
   hath not looked upon me," that is, not kindly and gently, which would
   be pleasant and delightful; but severely, as to scorch her, and
   therefore looked black: and so Ambrose [74] reads the words; but
   interprets them of the Sun of righteousness, who had not shone upon
   her, being deprived of which she had not attended to her devotion and
   observance of the commands, which had brought blackness upon her. 1.
   The Targum expounds this of the congregation of Israel, which was made
   black by the idolatrous worship of the sun and moon; against this, a
   law was provided, it was strictly prohibited by God (Deut. 17:3), but
   yet was very early in the world; most nations under the sun fell into
   it; some worshipped the sun under one name, and some under another, and
   all paid a regard unto it; this idolatrous worship seems to have
   obtained in Job's time (see Job 31:26, 27), and the Jewish nation was
   not exempt from it; they frequently fell into it. and were blackened by
   it (see 2 Kings 23:5-11; Ezek. 8:16), for idolatry, error, and
   superstition, will make the church black. 2. Others understand it of
   Christ, [75] "the Sun of righteousness;" and that she was made black,
   either by suffering for him, or else by being in his company, in whose
   presence, all other beauty, but his oxen, vanishes and disappears. Thus
   a person that is not of a fair complexion, being in the company of one
   that is, looks abundantly worse than if viewed alone: Christ's beauty
   infinitely exceeds any that is in us; there is no comparison between
   them; we look black, exceeding black, when compared to Christ. But, 3.
   I should rather choose to understand it of the sun of persecution, for
   under this name it goes in Matthew 13:6 compared with v. 21, and this
   seems to suit better with the church's present state and circumstances;
   and, indeed, every one "that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall
   suffer persecution," from the tongues, if not from the hands of men:
   and this persecution, which the church underwent, seems to be a very
   vehement one, in that she compares it to the looks and scorchings of
   the sun; and it must continue some time upon her, to make and leave
   such visible marks and impressions upon it; and yet she patiently
   endured all, and bravely "bore the heat and burden of the day," and
   seems to be no more ashamed of her sufferings, than she was of the
   person and cause for whom she suffered. The allusion is to persons
   burnt with the sun, [76] and so made black or swarthy, as in some
   countries; and especially to such who are much in the fields, and
   employed in rural work, as the church is represented as a keeper of
   vineyards and of flocks of sheep, in the following words.

   2dly, Her "mother's children were angry with her." To her outward
   persecutions were added intestine broils; it is therefore no wonder she
   looked so black as she did: oftentimes a man's worst enemies are those
   of his own house. The Targum by mother's children understands the false
   prophets, who taught the congregation of Israel to serve idols, and
   walk in the statutes of the people; by reason of which, she served not
   the Lord, neither walked in his statutes, nor kept his precepts and his
   laws. R. Sol. Jarchi thinks the Egyptians are intended, among whom the
   Israelites were brought up; many of whom came along with them out of
   Egypt, and were frequently the cause of their falling into sin: but
   rather we are to understand by mother's children, either, 1. Indwelling
   sins and corruptions, which are produced with nature; lust conceived,
   as soon as we were conceived; nay, we were conceived with it, and in
   it, as the Psalmist says (Ps. 51:5), "Behold I was shapen in iniquity,
   and in sin did my mother conceive me;" which brought forth sin in us,
   as soon as we were brought forth into the world: and these indwelling
   lusts and corruptions proclaim war against us; these war against the
   soul, and sometimes "bring it into captivity to the law of sin which is
   in the members;" they frequently draw us away to the performance of
   sinful actions, making us the keepers of other vineyards, and often
   divert us from our duty, and cause us to neglect it; they hinder us
   from doing the good we would; for "when we would do goods evil is
   present with us;" and so we may be said not to keep our own vineyard Or
   else, 2. Carnal professors may be here intended, who are members of the
   same society, externally children of the same mother, who profess
   themselves of the holy city, are pretenders to godliness, but enemies
   to it; such are they, who have "a form of godliness, but deny the power
   thereof," in themselves, and hate it in others; which, perhaps, may be
   one reason why these children that were born after the flesh, these
   false brethren, were angry with the church here; as they frequently are
   at her zealous defense and vindication of gospel-truths and ordinances,
   in the power and purity of them, and at her faithful reproofs and
   admonitions to them and others, throwing all the scandal and reproach
   upon her that possibly they can: now these are generally her most
   bitter and implacable enemies, are thorns in her side, and give her the
   greatest uneasiness; causing more grief and trouble to her, than all
   her sufferings and persecution from the world; for hereby they blacken
   and lessen her reputation and character, more than any other whatever;
   and yet bear it she must, and patiently she ought to endure it; Christ
   himself was not free from it; for who were more bitter and implacable
   enemies to him and his gospel, than the Jews, God's professing people,
   and the chief among them, the high-priests and Pharisees?

   3dly, She says "they made her the keeper of the vineyards," as an
   effect of their anger to her, and this, no doubt, added to her
   blackness; for being obliged to lie abroad in the fields, to keep the
   vineyards, she was exposed to the scorching sunbeams, and thereby got
   the hue she appeared with; this employment being not only very slavish,
   but base, mean, and reproachful; it was what was usually done by the
   poorer sort, and was much below the honor and dignity she was raised
   unto. By vineyards may be meant false churches; and by her keeping
   them, her falling in with their corrupt worship, and observance of the
   vain traditions and ordinances of men; which Christ complains of, and
   condemns in the Jewish church, who "made the commandment of God of none
   effect by their traditions:" But this the church was obliged unto by
   her mother's children; her compliance does not seem to be voluntary,
   but forced, and she complains of it as an imposition; "they made me,"
   that is, forced and obliged me to do it. And this produced,

   4thly, A neglect of her own vineyard, "but mine own vineyard have I not
   kept;" which still increased her blackness through outward persecution,
   intestine broils, and a sinful compliance to human traditions, arising
   either from fear or weakness, or both, her own vineyard, the church, or
   her own soul, was neglected, and the affairs of it; her duty and
   business incumbent on her, [77] the religious exercise she ought to
   have been employed in: with the Romans, neglect of fields and vineyards
   came under the notice of the censors, and did not go unpunished. [78]
   Every believer has talents more or less given him to occupy, grace to
   exercise, gifts to use, and a part assigned him in the Lord's vineyard,
   to labor in; and when these things are neglected by him, either through
   the fear of men, or the corruptions of his own heart, he may be said,
   not to have kept his vineyard; which, perhaps, sometimes is like his
   who was "void of understanding, which was all grown over with thorns,
   and nettles had covered the face thereof;" but when he is sensible of
   it, he will acknowledge and bewail it, as the church does here; she
   does not go about to extenuate her sin, by the anger of her mother's
   children, nor by their obliging her to keep other vineyards, but
   ingenuously acknowledges that it was her fault to neglect her own;
   which, as it was prejudicial to herself, so it was highly resented by
   Christ, who thereupon removed his presence from her; for she seems to
   be at a loss to know where he was, as is manifest from the following
   words.

Chapter 1 Verse 7

   Tell me, (O thou whom my soul loveth), where thou feedest, where
   thou makest thy flocks to rest at noon: For why should I be as one
   that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having, in the two former verses, directed her speech
   to the daughters of Jerusalem, and given them an account of herself,
   and present condition, with the reasons thereof, which she did, in
   order to solve their objections, and remove all discouragements from
   them that might arise from thence; and being sensible of her weakness
   and sinfulness in complying with, and embracing the traditions and
   doctrines of men, in which she found no solid food for her soul; she
   therefore makes application to Christ, the great shepherd of the sheep,
   that he would feed, refresh, guide, direct, and restore her wandering
   soul. In these words are,

   I.A request made unto him.

   II.Some arguments used by her to prevail upon him.

   I.Here is a request made by the church of Christ, which consists of two
   parts.

   First. To know where he feedeth; "Tell me where thou feedest."

   Secondly, That he would inform her where he rested and refreshed his
   flock in the heat of the day, "where thou makest thy flocks to rest at
   noon;" both which we shall enter into a consideration of.

   First, She desires to know where Christ fed; which is to be understood
   not passively, where he himself was fed, or where he fed himself; but
   actively, where he fed others, namely his flock; which, though not
   expressed in the original text, must be understood; and it may be
   observed here, that God's own children sometimes may be at a loss to
   know where Christ feeds; which may arise, either from the prevailings
   of corruptions in them, whereby they have stepped out of the ways of
   Christ; or from the hidings of God's face, and the withdrawings of the
   Sun of righteousness, or from the violent temptations of Satan, and
   fierce persecutions of the world; but when they are hungry, and
   desirous of spiritual food, they will enquire after it, and are very
   jealous, lest they should not be fed by Christ, and with the wholesome
   words of faith and sound doctrine; therefore in these straits they make
   their application to Christ, and him only, who "feeds his flock like a
   shepherd;" which branch of Christ's work and office we shall now
   consider; and shall endeavor to shew,

   1st, What this phrase supposes and intends, as referred to Christ.

   2dly, What he feeds his flock with.

   3dly, How, after what manner, and by what means he feeds them.

   4thly, Where he does so.

   1st, It will be proper to enquire what is supposed and intended by
   Christ's feeding souls.

   1. It supposes that Christ is a shepherd; and he frequently calls
   himself so, in John 10. The scriptures, both of the Old and New
   Testament, do abundantly testify that he bears this character, and
   stands in this relation to his people, where he is called God's
   shepherd, "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man
   that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts," (Zech. 13:7) now he is so
   called because he is the shepherd, whom God the Father hath approved
   of, chosen, appointed, set up, and sent to be the shepherd of the
   sheep; who, as such, died for the sheep and rose again, and as such
   must give an account unto the Father, of all the sheep which he has
   entrusted him with; he must bring in the full number, yea, must not
   have one of them wanting. He is also called the chief shepherd; "And
   when the chief shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of
   glory, which fadeth not away," (1 Peter 5:4) which title he well
   deserves; for he that is God's shepherd, is also God's fellow, entirely
   equal to him in the dignity of his nature, and in the fullness of his
   power and glory; all other shepherds are under him, they receive their
   commissions from him, have their several flocks assigned to them by
   him, are furnished with abilities from him to feed them; to him, at
   last, must they give an account of themselves, their work, and the
   flocks that were put under their care, and from him shall they receive
   the never-fading crown of glory. He likewise calls himself the good
   shepherd; "I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd giveth his life
   for the sheep," (John 10:11) and he may very justly call himself so,
   for so he was to him that employed him, and so he is to those who are
   made his care and charge; he was faithful to his Father, that appointed
   him, and is merciful and compassionate to, careful and tender of the
   sheep committed to his trust; of which, a greater proof cannot be
   given, than his laying down his life for them. He is called the great
   shepherd; "Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our
   Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep," (Heb. 13:20) which will
   manifestly appear, if we consider the dignity of his person, being the
   Son of God; the nature of his flock, the souls of men, therefore he is
   called "the shepherd and bishop of souls;" and also the largeness of
   his abilities for this work: he has an exquisite knowledge of them, he
   can call them all by name; he is endued with infinite wisdom and
   prudence to manage and order his flock aright; has an almighty arm to
   protect and defend them from all their enemies; is furnished with large
   supplies of grace for them, and bears an inexpressible love unto them.
   Finally, he is the one, and the only shepherd; "I will set up one
   shepherd over them, and he shall feed them," (Ezek. 34:23) not but that
   there are other shepherds, which are under Christ, and whom he employs
   in his service, to feed his flock; but Christ is the chief and
   principle; God the Father never did, nor ever will set up any other; he
   is the only shepherd that owns the flock, having purchased it with his
   own blood, and he alone is able to take care of it.

   2. Feeding being applied to Christ, not only supposes that he is a
   shepherd, but also that he has a flock to feed; "He shall feed his
   flock like a shepherd," (Isa. 40:11). All the elect are Christ's flock,
   they are "his people, and the sheep of his pasture;" the Father has
   given them to him, and has put them into his hands; he has also
   purchased them with his blood, and calls them by his grace: hence they
   know his voice, follow his steps, believe in him, and therefore shall
   never perish, but have everlasting life. Which flock is, 1. A distinct
   one; it is distinguished from all others, by electing, redeeming, and
   efficacious grace; Christ's sheep are distinct from the world's goats,
   and Satan's wolves in sheep's clothing, and will one day be separated
   and manifestly distinguished, not only from the open enemies of Christ,
   but also from all painted hypocrites, and carnal professors, 2. Though
   this flock is divided into many parts and branches, yet it is but one
   flock; for, as there are but "one fold, and one shepherd," so there is
   but one flock under the care of this shepherd; though there are many
   particular flocks or churches here on earth, yet there is but one
   general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written
   in heaven." 3. This is but a little flock; "Fear not, little flock,
   etc." (Luke 12:32). Christ's cote of sheep are little and contemptible
   in the eyes of the world; and are low and mean in their own eyes; they
   are few in number, when compared with the world's goats, though when
   all appear together in glory, they will be a "great multitude, which no
   man can number." 4. It is called a flock of slaughter: Thus said the
   Father to the Son, "Feed the flock of the slaughter," and he replied,
   "I will feed the flock of the slaughter, even you, O poor of the
   flock," (Zech. 11:4-7) and it is so called, because it is exposed to
   the cruelty and barbarity of open and avowed enemies, and to the
   ravenings of wolves in sheep's clothing; the saints, for the sake of
   Christ and his gospel, have been "killed all the day long, and
   accounted as sheep for the slaughter," (Rom. 8:36). 5. Nevertheless it
   is a beautiful flock, as the people of the Jews are called in Jeremiah
   13:20; the saints are beautiful in Christ's eyes, being clothed with
   his spotless righteousness, washed in his precious blood, and
   sanctified by his Spirit; therefore, however black they may be in their
   own eyes, or in the eyes of others, they are comely and delightful in
   the eyes of Christ.

   3. This act of feeding, takes in and comprehends the whole work and
   business of a faithful shepherd towards his flock; all which Christ
   fully and exactly performs, 1. He knows them distinctly, and takes a
   particular account of them; he knows them so, that he can call them all
   by name; he knew them full well in his father's gift of them to him,
   and so he did when he shed his precious blood for them; he knew
   distinctly all that he died fort and in effectual calling, he sets his
   mark, stamps his image on them, that it may also appear, both to
   themselves and others, to whose flock they belong; he took a particular
   account of them, when the Father put them. into his hands, and made
   them his care and charge, and they shall "again pass under the hands of
   him that telleth them;" for he will take care that not one of them
   shall be lost, but shall be all safely folded in heaven. 2. He not
   only, as a shepherd, takes a particular account of his flock, but he
   also leads them out, goes before them, and they follow him; he leads
   them out of the barren pastures of sin, and leads them into the green
   pastures of his love and grace; he goes before them as an example to
   the flock, of love, meekness, humility, patience, etc. and they follow
   him, in an observance of his ordinances, and in an obedience to his
   commands, till he has safely conducted them to glory. 3. He protects
   them from all their enemies; Christ's flock is exposed unto, and
   surrounded by many a roaring lion; ravenous wolves, and snarling dogs
   stand ready to devour it, had they but as large a permission, and as
   good an opportunity as they desire; but as David defended his father's
   sheep from the lion and the bear, so does Christ defend his; he has
   power enough to do it, and there is not wanting in him, either will,
   courage, or diligence. 4. He restores his sheep, when they have
   wandered and strayed from the fold; as it is natural for sheep to go
   astray, so at as common to Christ's sheep, not only before, but after
   conversion; "I have gone astray like a lost sheep," says David (Ps.
   119:176), "seek thy servant;" Christ does so, when his sheep go astray,
   he seeks every where until he has found them; when he lays them upon
   his shoulders, and brings them into his fold again, rejoicing; he
   restores their souls to their former life and liveliness, and "leads
   them in the paths of righteousness, for his own name's sake." 5. He
   heals all their diseases; there are many diseases which sheep are
   liable to, and therefore had need to be well looked after; so there are
   many diseases which Christ's sheep are liable to, but they are all
   healed by him; he binds up the broken hearted, strengthens the weak,
   heals the sick and wounded; none ever die of their diseases; he is a
   sovereign, free, universal and infallible physician. 6. He watches over
   them in the night seasons, as the shepherds of Bethlehem did over their
   flocks; he watches over them night and day, in the dark and cloudy day,
   in the night of affliction, temptation and desertion; he never leaves
   them, nor forsakes them. 7. In short, he makes all necessary provisions
   for them; so that they shall not, neither can they want any good thing;
   he takes care that they shall have the best of food, and what is most
   suitable and proper for them; he has all fullness of grace treasured up
   in him, and he freely distributes it among them as they stand in need.

   Having thus taken notice of what is supposed and intended in this act
   of feeding, I shall now consider,

   2dly, "What Christ feeds his flock with," and that is, 1. With himself,
   who is "the bread of life," which being fed upon by faith, supports and
   maintains the life of God's children; and such are the nature, virtue,
   and efficacy of it, that if a man eat thereof, he shall never hunger
   after the sinful pleasures of this life, so as he has heretofore done;
   he shall also never die the second death, but shall live spiritually
   here, and eternally with Christ hereafter. Christ's "flesh is meat"
   indeed, and "his blood is drink indeed;" and the believing soul tastes
   a sweetness therein, and receives nourishment from hence. Christ is the
   hidden manna, the food of the wilderness, which faith lives upon,
   whilst travelling through it. O how richly are the saints fed, whose
   food is Christ himself! 2. He feeds them with the gospel, the doctrines
   and promises of it; the doctrines of the gospel are "the wholesome
   words of our Lord Jesus Christ," in which believers are nourished up;
   these are sweet to their taste, the joy and rejoicing of their hearts,
   and are esteemed by them more than their necessary food; the promises
   of the gospel are "exceedingly great and precious;" faith often lives
   upon them; the whole gospel furnishes the believer with a variety of
   food; in it are milk for babes and meat for strong men; there is what
   is suitable to the dispositions, tastes, and constitutions of all God's
   children. 3. He feeds them with the discoveries of his love and grace;
   he brings them into his "banqueting-house," and his "banner over them
   is love;" there he gives his best wine, and revives and refreshes their
   fainting and drooping souls with it; he not only feeds them with
   himself, "the bread of life," but he also sheds abroad his love in
   their hearts, which is "better than wine;" and thus, with both these,
   from time to time, does he regale them; and in making such comfortable
   repasts for them, which they largely feed upon, they "grow stronger and
   stronger," until, at length, they become perfect men in Christ Jesus.
   But,

   3dly, "How, after what manner, and by what means does Christ feed his
   flock?" This is the part of the church's request; for so the words may
   be read, "Tell me how thou feedest, and how thou makest thy flocks to
   rest at noon. [79] Now, Christ feeds his flock: 1. By his ministers,
   who are his under-shepherds, to whom he gives commissions to feed his
   flock, saying, as he did to Peter, John 21:15, 16, 17: "Feed my lambs,
   feed my sheep;" who receive food from Christ, the great Shepherd, and
   have suitable gifts and graces bestowed upon them, that they may feed
   souls "with knowledge and understanding," that is, with the doctrines
   of the gospel; which is the food Christ would have his fed with, as has
   been shewn already. 2. He feeds them by his ordinances, which are
   "breasts of consolation" to his people, out of which they suck, and are
   satisfied. Christ oftentimes makes a feast for his people, in his
   ordinances, and bids them welcome, and says, "Eat, O friends, yea,
   drink abundantly, O beloved;" and their faith feeds heartily upon "the
   goodness and fatness of his house." 3. He does all this by his Spirit;
   it is the Spirit of Christ that takes Christ, and the things of Christ,
   and sets them before us, for faith to feed and live upon; it is he that
   applies the doctrines, and seals the promises of the gospel to us; and
   it is he that sheds abroad the love of Christ in us; the ministry of
   the word, and the ordinances of the gospel, are the means of feeding
   souls; but these would be dry breasts, and would fall short of
   satisfying and refreshing them; were they not attended with the Spirit
   of Christ.

   4thly, The last enquiry is, Where does Christ feed? To this I answer,
   in the gardens, his several and particular churches, according to
   chapter 6:2. "My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of
   spices, to feed in the gardens." Would any, with the church, know where
   Christ feeds? It is where his gospel is powerfully preached, his
   ordinances purely administered, and the laws of his house faithfully
   put in execution: this may then serve as a direction to such enquiring
   souls, who would be glad to know where Christ feeds, that they may feed
   with him; let such seek after a gospel ministry and sit under it; or a
   church in gospel-order, and give up themselves unto it, to walk with
   the saints, in all the ordinances, and commands of Christ. So much for
   the first part of the request. It remains to be observed,

   Secondly, That the church is also desirous to know where Christ "makes
   his flock to rest at noon;" and there was a great deal of reason for
   her to make such a request as this, for it was noon with her; the sun
   was in its meridian, in its full strength, and had looked upon her, as
   she declares in the former verse. The allusion is to shepherds in hot
   countries, leading their flocks to some shady place, where they may be
   sheltered from the scorching heat of the sun; which, as Virgil says,
   was at the fourth hour, or ten o'clock, two hours before noon. [80] We
   read of prozati&lt;a mesembriazunta, sheep nooning themselves, or lying
   down at noon, under a shade by a fountain asleep. [81] Some by noon
   understand the noon of the everlasting day of the saints" happiness and
   felicity in heaven, where Christ feeds his elect with joys that will
   never end; [82] "leads them to fountains of living water, wipes all
   tears from their eyes," and gives them an everlasting rest from all
   their toil and labor; but I think, by it we are rather to understand,
   either, 1. The noon of temptation, which is sometimes very hot, fierce
   and violent; Satan throws his fiery darts, thick and fast, which
   oftentimes give the believer much uneasiness; he is "in heaviness
   through manifold temptations;" but Christ makes him to lie down
   quietly, and rest safely; which he does, either by shading him from the
   violent heat thereof, or by supporting him under it, or else by giving
   him deliverance from it. Christ has sweet resting-places for his
   people, in the time of temptation, and would you know where and what
   they are? I answer, the fullness and all-sufficiency of grace, which is
   in him, is what he makes a believing soul sweetly to rest in, at such a
   time; when he is pleased to say unto it, as he did to the apostle Paul,
   when in such a case, "My grace is sufficient for thee:" such sweet
   resting-places, in times of temptation, are also his precious blood,
   which always speaks peace and pardon, and is of an eternal efficacy;
   his spotless righteousness, in which, as neither law nor justice, so
   neither can Satan find any flaw; as likewise, his atoning sacrifice, by
   which he has effectually "put away sin," and perfected for ever them
   that are sanctified; and so is his advocateship and intercession, in
   the discharge of which, he pleads the believer's cause, answers all
   Satan's charges and accusations exhibited against him, and prays for
   him, "that his faith fail not;" moreover, the covenant of grace is
   another resting-place, which stands firm and sure, and the promises
   thereof are absolute, unconditional, and shall never fail. Now these
   are some of those sweet resting-places, in which Christ causes his
   people to lie down and rest in the noon-time of temptation: or else, by
   noon may be meant, 2. The noon of affliction, which is sometimes very
   sharp and severe upon God's children; so that as Job says, chapter
   30:30. their skin is black upon them, and their bones are burnt with
   the heat thereof;" they have generally a large share of afflictions in
   this world; this sun oftentimes smites them very severely: but Christ
   has his resting-places for them, where he makes them lie down and rest,
   which are such as the world know nothing of; he grants them his
   presences and goes along with them, when they walk through the fire, or
   through the water, so that the one shall not kindle upon them, nor the
   other overflow them; he puts underneath his everlasting arms, and
   supports them under all their trials; he makes their beds in their
   affliction, so that it becomes easy to them; he discovers his love and
   grace to their souls, and gives them views of their interest in him; he
   remembers his word of promise to them, on which he has caused them to
   hope; lets them see that all their afflictions are in love, that they
   are all working for their good, and when he thinks proper, he delivers
   them; and upon such pillows, and in such resting-places as these, does
   he cause his people to lie down, where "he gives his beloved sleep," in
   the noon-time of affliction: Or else, 3. By the noon may be meant the
   noon of persecution; and this, indeed, seems to be the case of the
   church here; the sun of persecution had scorched her; and her "mother's
   children were angry with her;" and therefore, being in distress and
   anguish of soul, she desires to know unto what cooling and refreshing
   shades Christ used to lead his flock at such a time. It is an allusion
   to shepherds, as before observed, who, in those hot countries, used to
   lead their flocks in the heat of the day, which is at noon, to some
   cool and shady place, where they might repose themselves, and be
   preserved from the vehemence of the scorching sun. Most of the Jewish
   writers [83] interpret it of the captivity o£ the people of Israel,
   which was a time of tribulation and distress unto them: the heat of
   persecution seems chiefly intended, which fiery trial oftentimes
   befalls God's children; but Christ has his resting-places for them, at
   such a time, and under such a trial; he will "recompense tribulation to
   them that trouble his people," but to those that are troubled, that is,
   with persecution, he will "give rest with us," says the apostle (2
   Thess. 1:6, 7): rest here, and rest hereafter; he gives liberty of soul
   when in prison, and fills with an unspeakable joy, even when both their
   goods and good names are spoiled, and taken away from them; he gives
   them a peace under all the racks and tortures, cruelty and barbarity
   that are exercised upon them by their enemies, which passeth all
   understanding; they find such rest, satisfaction, and contentment in
   the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, that they choose rather
   with Moses, "to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy
   the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season," (Heb. 11:25).

   Thirdly, The arguments she makes use of to obtain her request, which
   are these, 1st, She argues from her strong love and affection to him;
   "Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth:" it is true, these words may be
   considered as an endearing title which she gave to him; but yet they
   seem more strongly to express her singular esteem of him, and her
   sincere and unfeigned love and affection to him, than those usual
   titles, my love, or my beloved, do; which love of hers might be very
   well improved as an argument to obtain her request, thus. "O thou who
   art the great Shepherd of the sheep, tell me in what pastures thou art
   graciously pleased to feed thy flock, and to what cooling shades thou
   dost lead them, in the heat of the day, to screen them from the
   scorching sun. She who makes this humble request unto thee, though mean
   and unworthy of thy notice, yet is one that loves thee with all her
   heart and soul; who, though of late, through the weakness and
   sinfulness of her own heart, and through the fear and force of others,
   has stepped aside from thy commandments to the doctrines and traditions
   of men; yet, being made sensible of her weakness and folly therein,
   cannot be easy to continue among those false teachers and worshippers;
   and therefore, from a real love to thy person, a respect to thine
   ordinances, and a regard to thy glory, humbly desires to be informed of
   these things." Now, though the church knew full well that her love to
   Christ could merit nothing, nor deserve a gracious answer from him; yet
   she was sensible that expressions of love were very pleasing to him,
   and therefore she takes this method. The nature, causes and actings of
   a soul's love to Christ have been shewn on verse 3. 2dly, She argues
   and expostulates with him, on the account of her present case, and what
   was likely to befall her, if he did not give her some speedy
   directions; "for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the
   flocks of thy companions?" There is much difficulty and difference in
   the rendering of the Hebrew word, which we translate "as one that
   turneth aside"; [84] some render it "as one that covereth herself, or
   is covered", [85] either as an harlot; [86] so Tamar covered herself,
   which made Judah take her to be an harlot (Gen. 38:14), or as a widow
   in mourning, [87] it being the custom of mourners to cover themselves
   (Ezek. 24:17, 22), and then the sense is, "Why should I be suspected to
   be an harlot, and looked upon as an unchaste woman, that has left her
   own husband to follow strangers; when thou, who art the searcher of
   hearts and trier of reins, knowest that I love thee in sincerity, and
   am heartily desirous of following thee in thine own ways:" or se the
   sense is, "Why should I appear in a widow's dress, and go mourning and
   sorrowing as if I had no husband: O tell me where thou art, and where I
   may enjoy thy presence, and be delighted with thy company." Junius and
   Tremellius translate the words thus, "Why should I be as one that
   spreadeth the tent with the flocks of thy companions;" and give this as
   the sense, "Why should I? I would not, though but for a time, have any
   conversation with such persons, who pretend to be thy friends, and are
   not; I cannot bear it, my soul abhors and detests the thoughts of it,
   though, perhaps, thro" my weakness and infirmities, I may do it; O
   therefore tell me quickly, speedily, where thou feedest." Others render
   it "as one that wanders about, declinest or turns aside by the flocks
   of thy companions": [88] this agrees with our version; and from these
   words we may observe, 1. That there are some who would be the
   associates and companions of Christ, who indeed are not; these were not
   really so, but usurped to themselves an equal power and authority with
   Christ: such are those who take upon them an arbitrary and lordly
   government of Christ's flock, who make and impose laws on the
   consciences of men, which Christ never established, and who teach
   doctrines contrary to those which Christ taught, and which are
   derogatory to his honor and glory: such rivals with. And pretended
   companions of Christ, are, the pope of Rome, who exalts himself above
   all that is called God; Arians, who deny Christ's divinity; Socinians,
   that oppose his satisfaction; and all self-justiciaries, that advance
   the doctrine of justification by works, in opposition to justification
   by his imputed righteousness: but such Christ will not own as his
   friends, nor suffer to be his rivals and companions; for as his own arm
   brought salvation to him, so the government is alone upon his
   shoulders; as he was alone in the purchase and salvation of his flock,
   so he will be in the government and feeding of it; for his glory, which
   arises from thence, he will not give to another. Christ never did, nor
   never will empower any to make new laws, nor coin new doctrines for his
   church and people. 2. These false and pretended friends and companions
   of Christ, who are no other than wolves in sheep's clothing, have their
   flocks. Heretics and false teachers, in all ages, have had their
   followers, and sometimes large numbers have been drawn away after them;
   and this God suffers in a judicial way; he gives men up to believe a
   lie, because they love not the truth; but having itching ears, grew
   weary of it and want something new: also these are permitted to have
   their flocks, by themselves, that Christ's little flock might be
   distinguished from them, and that those who are chosen, loved, and
   approved by God, might be made manifest; as also to animate and excite
   the faithful ministers of the gospel to be constant and assiduous, bold
   and faithful to preach the doctrines of Christ. and to oppose errors.
   3. Believers are very fearful, lest they should, and are very desirous
   that they might not go aside from the ways of Christ; they are jealous
   of their own hearts, and are sensible that there is in them a
   propensity thereunto; they know that Satan uses all the crafty methods,
   and takes all the opportunities he can to draw them aside, and corrupt
   their minds from the simplicity that is in Christ; they are apprized of
   their own weakness, and know that they are not kept by their own power,
   but that if they are left to themselves, they shall soon divert to
   crooked paths: and the present case of the church also manifestly shews
   that God may, for a time, suffer his own children to be carried away
   with the error of the wicked; but when they are made sensible of it,
   they will be filled with an holy indignation against it, and make it
   their principal request at the throne of grace to be delivered out of
   it, and that their feet may be guided and directed in the paths of
   Christ: now those who are desirous that they may be kept from turning
   aside unto, and joining with the flocks of false teachers, who vainly
   pretend to be the friends and companions of Christ, should abide in the
   Lord's inheritance, keep close to Christ's ways and ordinances, and not
   believe every spirit, but try them according to the word of God, as the
   noble Bereans did; they should earnestly beg that the gospel which is
   preached unto them might effectually work in them, and make deep
   impressions upon them; so shall they not be "like children tossed about
   with every wind of doctrine." But let us hear what directions Christ
   himself gives to the church in the following words.

Chapter 1 Verse 8

   If thou know not (O thou fairest among women!) go thy way forth
   by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds
   tents.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word think [89] that these are the words of the chorus of virgins
   or daughters of Jerusalem, by whom she is called "the fairest among
   women," in chapters 5:9 and 6:1 who here instruct and direct her where
   she might find and come at the sight of her beloved; but the note of R.
   Solomon Jarchi is much preferable, which is, that "this is the answer
   of the shepherd;" for it was to him, and not to the virgins, that she
   made her application; nor were they capable of giving her any
   directions in this case, but rather stood in need of some from her, as
   is manifest from chapters 5:9 and 6:1. In this answer of Christ's unto
   the church, are these three things:

   I.The commendation he gives her; "O thou fairest among women!"

   II.A supposition of her ignorance: "if thou know not."

   III.A direction to her; "go thy way," etc.

   I.Christ in these words gives the church an excellent commendation, "O
   thou fairest among women;" in what sense the church is fair and comely
   has been shown, on verse 5 who, tho' black in herself, and in her own
   eyes, yet having Christ's righteousness imputed to her, and his grace
   wrought in her, is fair and comely: which commendation here, both in
   itself. and as it follows upon the account which she gave of herself
   and state, in the preceding verses, may teach us the following things:
   1. That the beauty of the church is very great and exceedingly admired
   by Christ; as some men are eminent for their strength, courage, and
   valor, so are some women for their beauty and comeliness; and she being
   said to be "the fairest among women," shews that her beauty must be
   excellent rind surpassing; as he is fairer in her eyes than all the
   sons, so she is fairer in his than all the daughters of Adam. 2. That
   believers are fairest in Christ's eyes, when blackest in their own: she
   had asserted of herself, in verse 5 that she was black; but here Christ
   says, that she was "the fairest among women." The humble believer that
   has low and mean thoughts of himself, on the account of the. corruption
   of his nature, the imperfection of his obedience, the weakness and
   insufficiency of his righteousness, is much more esteemed and valued by
   Christ, than the proud, haughty and vain-glorious Pharisee; an instance
   of this we have in Luke 18:13, 14. An humble soul is one that looks
   upon itself as the least of saints, and the chief of sinners; the
   countenance of such an one blushing at its sins and infirmities, is
   beautiful and comely in the eyes of Christ, and is a sight exceeding
   desirable to him; and therefore he says, in chapter 2:14, "Let me see
   thy countenance, let me hear thy voice, for sweet is thy voice, and thy
   countenance is comely." 3. That Christ's thoughts of believers are not
   according to those which they have of themselves, nor according to
   those which the world entertains of them; he "seeth not as man seeth,"
   neither does he look upon, or judge according to the outward
   appearance: the believer oftentimes looks upon, and judges of himself,
   according to his indwelling corruptions, and the inward frames of his
   soul, and draws black conclusions against himself: the world looks upon
   the outward, mean, and abject appearance of the saints, and so they
   become black and contemptible in their eyes; but Christ views them in
   himself, and in his own righteousness, and considers them in all that
   glory in which he saw them in the glass of his Father's purposes and
   decrees, which glory he has fully, resolved on, and designed to bring
   them to the actual possession of; and on this account they appear
   exceeding fair and beautiful in his eyes, 4. This excellent
   commendation of the church given by Christ, shews his amazing and
   unalterable love to her; he loved her now as well as ever;
   notwithstanding all her blackness thro" sins and sufferings, she was as
   fair in his eyes as ever, nay surpassingly fair, fairer than all
   others; though she had been negligent of her duty, and had sinfully
   complied with false and superstitious worship, with the doctrines and
   traditions of men, and thereby wandered from Christ and his ways, and
   knew not where he fed and caused his flock to rest; yet upon her first
   application to him, he gives her such a character, as expresses much
   love and tenderness, as well as manifests a very great regard to her,
   in directing and instructing of her: O matchless love! boundless grace!

   II.Here is a supposition of her ignorance, "if thou know not:" which is
   not to be understood, either by way of hesitation or reprehension, as
   if Christ either doubted of her ignorance, or reproved her for it, but
   by way of inference from what she had suggested; for this particle if,
   is not always hypothetic or conditional, but is sometimes illative (see
   Phil. 2:1), and thus the words may be rendered, "seeing thou knowest
   not," so Junius; or "because thou knowest not;" and may be considered
   as a reason why Christ gave her the following direction and advice, and
   will lead us to observe these two things: 1. That believers may, in
   some measure, be ignorant of a great many things in this life; this
   life is a state of imperfection, both with respect to holiness and
   knowledge; the greatest believer knows but in part, and sees things but
   through a glass, darkly; he is ignorant of himself in a great measure,
   though he may know much of the plague of his own heart, of the
   corruptions and treachery of it, yet he does not know all; for the
   heart is "deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can
   know it?" These words may be rendered from the Hebrew text, thus, [90]
   "If thou know not to thee, or, for thyself," so Ainsworth; or, "if thou
   knowest not thyself;" it is generally looked upon as a pleonasm, yet it
   may intend, not only the ignorance which was in herself, but also her
   ignorance of herself. Again, a believer maybe in some measure ignorant
   of Christ and his gospel; he may not so fully know his relation and
   union to him, and interest in him: many of those truths, which concern
   Christ's person, grace, and kingdom, may be but obscurely revealed unto
   him; he may have but a small insight into them: tho' he may have been
   long in Christ's school, yet he may be but a babe in knowledge, and
   need to be taught "the first principles of the oracles of God:" our
   knowledge of these things at best is but imperfect, and when compared
   with that which saints shall have in glory, is very dark and obscure:
   also believers sometimes may be at a very great loss to know where
   Christ feeds his church and people; and this has been the case of the
   saints, as it was the church here, in times of persecution, darkness,
   and superstition; they have not only been at a loss for his presence,
   but they have also been at a loss for his ordinances; they have not
   only been ignorant where he was, but also they have not known where his
   gospel was preached in the power, and his ordinances administered in
   the purity of them. 2. That though Christ's people are ignorant of a
   great many things, and of such which, as one would think, they should
   not be ignorant of, but should make it their principal business to be
   acquainted with, yet Christ does not upbraid them with it; for "he has
   compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way;" as
   their merciful and faithful high priest, he has atoned for their sins,
   both of ignorance and presumption; and as their prophet he instructs
   them by his word and Spirit, and "guides their feet in the way of
   peace;" and therefore the most ignorant soul need not be discouraged
   from going to Christ for wisdom, counsel and direction; but let him
   that "lacketh wisdom, ask it of him, who giveth liberally to all men,
   and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him," James 1:6.

   III.Here is a direction which Christ gives her, in answer to her
   request, which consists of two parts; First, To "go forth by the
   footsteps of the flock. Secondly, To "feed her kids beside the
   shepherds" tents."

   First, The first thing which Christ directs and advises her to, is, to
   "go her way forth by the footsteps of the flock." Some [91] consider
   these words, not as a direction to the church, but as spoken by way of
   resentment to her. Christ, observing the church was growing uneasy
   under her trials and temptations, and, as it were, threatening that if
   he did not relieve her, she would join herself to the flocks of his
   companions; being ignorant, both of her own beauty, which she had
   received from him, and of that relation which she stood in to him; as
   also, that she must expect to meet with more troubles, temptations and
   trials with him and for him; Christ, I say, observing and resenting
   this froward temper of hers, and the ignorance that was in her, bids
   her be gone from his presence, and follow the steps of those flocks
   which she had mentioned, and see what would be the consequence of it,
   and whether she would find her account in it or no; and "feed her
   kids," that is, give a loose to, and indulge her carnal lusts and
   corruptions among those persons whom she seemed to have an inclination
   to: but they seem rather to be spoken by way of direction than
   resentment; and there are some, who, though they look upon the words as
   a direction of Christ to the church, yet by "the footsteps of the
   flock," understand the paths and ways of those sheep and shepherds,
   among whom she was, and by whom she was in danger of being carried
   away, and read the words thus, "Go out of those footsteps of the flock,
   [92] so Junius and Tremellius. But though, no doubt, the church is here
   directed and exhorted to depart from the ways of sin, to leave all
   superstition and idolatry, and come out from among false worshippers;
   yet I cannot but think that the "footsteps of the flock" are the rule
   and mark by which she was to go, and keep her eye upon, in finding
   Christ: and it may be enquired, 1st, What is meant by "the flock."
   2dly, What by "the footsteps" of it, by, and in which the church was to
   go.

   1st, What is meant by "the flock;" and by it we are to understand, the
   flock which the Father has committed into the hands of Christ, which he
   has purchased with his own bloods and continually feeds like a
   shepherd; this is called a flock in the singular number, in opposition
   to the numerous flocks of those other shepherds mentioned in verse 7,
   for as there is but one shepherd, who is Christ, so there is but one
   flock, which is the church; of which flock I have given a more large
   account on the former verse.

   2dly, By "the footsteps of the flock," are meant the ways and
   ordinances in which saints by faith walk, in obedience to Christ Jesus;
   he has left us an example that we should follow his steps; so far as
   believers walk therein, we should follow and walk in the steps of the
   same faith which they have done, and in so doing, may, and shall find
   the presence of Christ Jesus. From whence may be observed, 1. That we
   have no reason to expect a new gospel nor new ordinances; but we should
   enquire for the good old way, which the saints in all ages have trod;
   no new lights nor new revelations, that have no foundation in the word
   of God, are to be regarded by us; for "we have a more sure word of
   prophecy, to which we do well if we take heed." Christ has in his word
   established the order of his churches, fixed the ordinances thereof,
   till his second coming, and marked out the paths in which he would have
   his people walk; and these are the footsteps of the flock, which saints
   in all ages should go by. 2. That the faith and obedience of God's
   children, as to the substance of them, have been the same in all ages:
   There is but "one faith, one Lord, one baptism;" the object of faith
   has been always the same; so have the Spirit and Author of faith, and
   also the grace itself, as to its nature and actings: there has been but
   one Lord, who has established laws and ordinances, has a power to
   require obedience, and to whom, in all ages, it has been given by his
   saints, both in a way of doing and suffering. 3. That the practices of
   former saints, both as to their faith and obedience, are to be imitated
   by us (see Heb. 6:12, 13:7): but always with this limitation, given by
   the apostle Paul, "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ,"
   (1 Cor. 11:1) and indeed, no farther should we follow the most eminent
   saints, for faith and holiness, than as they have trod in those steps
   which Christ has marked out for them and us. 4. In so doing, we may
   expect to have our souls fed and nourished, as theirs were, and to
   enjoy the presence of Christ, as they did; for though our faith and
   obedience deserve none of all this, yet in walking in Christ's ways, we
   have most reason to expect it, being encouraged both by Christ's
   promises, and by those many instances and clouds of witnesses that have
   gone before us. The Targum and R. Sol. Jarchi, understand this part of
   the direction, of the righteous, in whose steps those that come after
   should tread.

   Secondly, The other part of the direction is, to feed her kids beside
   the shepherds" tents. It was common in the eastern countries, as Philo
   says of the Arabs, [93] not for men only to keep flocks, but women also
   and young virgins; of women keeping flocks (see Gen. 29:2; Ex. 2:16),
   the same Josephus says of the Troglodites; [94] and it was an early
   custom for shepherds to have tents where they fed their flocks: they
   were as early as the days of Jabal, who was the inventor of them (Gen.
   4:20). Hence the Arabian shepherds, who dwelt in tents, and moved them
   from place to place for the sake of pasturage, were called Scenites;
   and, 1st, By shepherds may be meant such who are called the companions
   of Christ in verse 7 [95] who only had the appearance of shepherds, but
   were inwardly ravenous wolves: the words may be rendered, "Feed thy
   kids above the shepherds tents, or above the tents of other shepherds;"
   so R. Aben Ezra and Junius; that is, go beyond their tents, and do not
   pitch thine where theirs are, but carry thy kids farther, into other
   pastures, and feed them with better and more wholesome food than they
   give: or else, by them, may be meant the ministers of the gospel, who
   are Christ's under-shepherds, whose business is to feed Christ's sheep
   and lambs, with the soul-refreshing doctrines of the everlasting
   gospel; who receive their commission from Christ to feed the flock, are
   furnished with abilities from him for that work, and must give an
   account unto him; and by, or near the tents of these shepherds, [96]
   the church is directed to feed her kids. 2. By the tents of these
   shepherds, may be meant those places of divine worship, where the
   ministers of Christ usually preach his gospel, and administer his
   ordinances; which tents or tabernacles are amiable and lovely to
   believers: the Jewish writers generally understand them of their
   schools or synagogues. [97] It is an allusion to shepherds" tents,
   which are usually pitched where they feed their flocks. 3. By kids may
   be meant young converts, who, though they are desirous of the sincere
   milk of the word, that they may grow thereby, yet are but weak in
   faith, and have but a small degree of knowledge; and therefore should
   be near the shepherds" tents, that they may be under their immediate
   care and inspection; as Christ himself has the strongest affection for
   these, and takes a special care of them, as in Isaiah 40:11, so he
   would have his ministers and churches be particularly careful and
   tender of them: these kids R. Aben Ezra calls hnma ykfq
   ojligopi&gt;vouv, "persons of little faith;" the very character which
   Christ gives of his disciples (Matthew 6:30), young converts are not
   only called kids, because of their faith and knowledge; but kids being
   young goats, lascivious and of an ill smell [98] may intimate, that
   notwithstanding the grace which is wrought in them at conversion, yet
   there still remains sin and corruption in them, disagreeable to
   themselves and others; as also, that being called by divine grace out
   of the world, and having separated from the men of it, they did male
   olere, smell ill, and were become abominable and contemptible to them;
   and therefore needed much refreshment and encouragement from the church
   and ministers) that they might not be discouraged and cast down at
   their own corruptions, nor at the frowns and reproaches of the world.
   This direction to the church, to feed her kids beside the shepherds
   tents, where the gospel was preached by Christ's ministers, shews the
   necessity and perpetuity of a gospel-ministry, and of
   gospel-ordinances; and what a value saints should have for them, and
   also what use they should make of them, as well as informs us of the
   wretched mistake of those persons who think themselves above hearing
   the word, and regarding ordinances.

Chapter 1 Verse 9

   Chapter 1

   VERSE 9.

   I have compared thee, O my love, to a company
   of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having returned a suitable answer, and given proper
   directions to the church in her present difficulties, enters upon a
   commendation of her, which is begun in this verse, and continued in the
   following one. In these words are,

   I.An affectionate title given to her; "O my love."

   II.A comparison which Christ makes of her, "to a company of horses in
   Pharaoh's chariots." And,

   III.It may be enquired why such a comparison is made and mentioned in
   this place.

   I.Here is a very loving and endearing title given unto her, · my love;"
   it may be rendered "my friend"; [99] there is a mutual friendship
   between Christ and believers; the church owns Christ to be her beloved
   and her friend, and Christ welcomes his church and people to the
   entertainments of his grace, under the characters of his beloved, and
   his friends, saying, "Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O
   beloved:" and he not only calls them so, but uses and treats them as
   such; he converses with them, and discloses the secrets of his heart
   unto them; he is a friend to them at all times, in adversity as well as
   prosperity, and has given the most incontestable proofs of it in his
   suffering and dying for them. The Septuagint render it, "my neighbor:"
   the church is Christ's neighbor; they dwell near to each other; he
   dwells in their hearts by faith, and they by faith dwell in him: he
   shews, that he regards his church as his neighbor, by loving her as
   himself; nay, he has so loved her, as to give himself for her. Again,
   if we consider this title, according to our version, it well suits the
   church, who is Christ's love. 1. Objectively; She is the object of his
   love, was so from eternity, will be so throughout all time, and when
   time shall be no more; he has given the fullest proofs of it in his
   undertaking, as a surety for her, in his assumption of her nature, in
   dying in her room and stead, and in making satisfaction for all her
   transgressions. The nature of this love has been shewn already on Song
   of Solomon 1:2. 2. She is Christ's love subjectively; Christ's love is
   fixed upon her, and is shed abroad in her heart, by the Spirit, and
   this causes love in her soul to him; that so as Christ loves her, she
   loves him, with a real, hearty, sincere, and superlative love; she is
   therefore Christ's love, both because he loves her, and also because
   she loves him.

   II.Here is made, by Christ, a comparison of her, "to a company of
   horses in Pharaoh's chariots: I have compared thee, O my love, etc."
   that is, I thought and imagined thee to be like unto them, [100] or I
   have made thee like unto them; which shews that she was not only like
   unto them, he having asserted her to be so, who must certainly know,
   but also that this was owing to him, that shew as so: or to my mare, as
   some render it, [101] which being a present by Pharoah to Solomon, he
   might have a particular regard for it; nor is such a comparison of a
   woman a disagreeable one; many women have had their names from this
   creature, from some celebrated excellence in them, as Hippo, Hippe,
   Hippia, etc. and the same figure is made use of by various writers.
   [102] Now the church is compared to a company of horses, to set forth
   her greatness and excellency, and to Egyptian ones, which were esteemed
   the best, and to those in Pharoah's chariots, which, no doubt, were
   best of all: all believers may very well be compared "to a company of
   horses in Pharoah's chariots;" 1. Because the horses in Pharoah's
   chariots were a choice and select company, picked and singled out from
   others, peculiarly for his service: so R. Sol. Jarchi interprets it, "a
   collection of horses," which, no doubt, was a choice and curious one;
   for if there were any more than others, it is very reasonable to
   suppose, that they were in Pharaoh's chariots. The church of Christ is
   a "chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, and a
   peculiar people;" they are distinguished and separated from others, by
   electing, redeeming, and. calling grace; they are a collection from the
   rest of mankind, made by the free, sovereign, and distinguishing grace
   of God; they are "a remnant: according to the election of grace,"
   chosen and singled out from others in Christ, before the foundation of
   the world; they are "redeemed from among men, and that out of every
   kindred, tongue, people, and nation;" whom God is pleased by his
   mighty, powerful, and efficacious grace to call, even, one of a city,
   and two of a family, and bring to the participation of peculiar favors
   and privileges, thro" Christ, in the church on earth, and with Christ
   for ever in glory. 2. These horses in Pharoah's chariots were, no
   doubt, bought at a very great price; Egyptian horses went at a very
   great price, in Solomon's time; a single one was valued at an hundred
   and fifty shekels of silver: (see 1 Kings 10:29) and therefore these,
   which were bought for Pharaoh's service, who was king of Egypt, being
   the best, must be supposed to be bought at a very great price. The
   church and people of God are bought with a price, and that with a very
   great one indeed, such a one, that angels and men could never have
   given; they are purchased, not with "corruptible things; as silver and
   gold;" no, all the riches in the world amassed together, could not have
   purchased a single soul, nor have given to God a ransom for it: "but
   they are bought with the precious blood" of the unblemished and
   unspotted Son of God; they are bought for the service of the King of
   kings, and at no less a rate, than at the expense of his own blood and
   life; the ransom which is given for them is himself; O how valuable
   must they be to Christ, and how much must they be esteemed by him! 3.
   These horses, being well fed, looked very beautiful and pleasant.
   Believers are fed with the finest of the wheat, with Christ and his
   fullness; Christ himself is the bread of life, and the hidden manna,
   which being fed upon by faith, removes hunger, supports life, and
   preserves from the second death; his flesh is meat indeed, and his
   blood is drink indeed, which give spiritual and divine refreshment to
   believers; his grace is represented by wine, milk, and honey, on which
   his people feeding plentifully, grow and look exceeding delightful and
   beautiful in his sight. 4. These horses, being the king's horses, as
   they were well fed, so, no doubt, they were well taken care of; they
   had proper persons appointed on purpose to attend upon them, and to
   supply them with what was necessary for them. Believers in Christ have
   a guard of angels to attend upon them, who encamp about them, and
   minister to them; for those "ministering spirits are sent forth to
   minister for them who shall be the heirs of salvation;" also the
   ministers of the gospel, being furnished with suitable grace and
   abilities, are appointed to feed them with the doctrines of the
   everlasting gospel, and to give to every one "their portion of meat in
   due season." Moreover they are not left merely to the care of angels
   and ministers, but the Lord himself likewise concerns himself for them;
   when his church is represented as a vineyard, he is said to be the
   keeper of it, who "watches over it night and day lest any hurt it;"
   when it is compared to a city, he is the wall of fire round about it;
   and when to a flock of sheep, he is the shepherd of it; and being here
   compared to a company of horses, it is owing to the food that he gives
   them, and the care he takes of them, that they appear "as his goodly
   horse in the battle," Zechariah 10:3, 5. Horses have been and are much
   delighted in by princes; and there is no reason to question but that
   those which ran in Pharaoh's chariots were so by him; Solomon's fancy
   and inclinations ran so strongly this way, and he took so great a
   delight in those creatures, that he broke through a divine command,
   Deuteronomy 17:16 compared with 1 Kings 10:29 to satisfy and indulge
   his carnal pleasure; and many other princes have run prodigious and
   excessive lengths this way. Julius Caesar set up a marble effigy of his
   horse in the temple; [103] Antoninus Verus erected a golden image for
   his. Nero clothed his with a senator's robe, and told him out a weekly
   stipend; Poppea Sabina, Nero's wife, had golden shoes made for hers;
   Caligula used to invite his to supper, and held out his golden cups to
   him; he would have made him a consul, as he afterwards made himself a
   priest, and his horse his colleague; Alexander the great built a city
   in honor of his Bucephalus; Cimon the Athenian buried his mares by his
   own sepulcher; and Commodus the emperor buried his horse in the
   Vatican. These instances, though vain and sinful, and not to be
   imitated, yet shew how much some princes have delighted in this sort of
   creatures. Now, as these creatures were the delight of princes, and,
   perhaps, of Pharaoh, so are believers the delight of Christ; he first
   makes them beautiful, and then delights in that beauty which he has put
   upon them; "the Lord taketh pleasure in his people, he will beautify
   the meek with salvation;" his heart is often ravished with his own
   grace in them, and his soul delights in that which he himself has given
   them; there is nothing in them of their own which can render them
   acceptable to him, and yet they are his jewels, the apple of his eye,
   and the delight of his heart. 6. Horses are stately and majestic
   creatures, especially a company of choice and well fed ones, that run
   in a chariot, as these were. There is a stateliness and majesty in
   believers, especially when they are united together in gospel-order, in
   a church-state: and the majesty, stateliness, and glory of a church of
   Christ, do not consist in the multitude of members, nor in their
   outward riches, pomp, and splendor; but in their being all clothed with
   Christ's righteousness, and possessed of his grace; in the enjoyment of
   his presence in ordinances; in their walking in love and unity with
   each other, and wisely towards them that are without; in having their
   conversation as becometh the gospel of Christ, and the profession which
   they make of it, and in shewing a becoming zeal for the truths and
   ordinances thereof; being thus blessed with these things, they may be
   truly said to be as stately and majestic as "a company of horses in
   Pharaoh's chariots," which were well fed, and harnessed in a splendid
   manner. 7. Horses are very strong creatures, especially, a company of
   them joined together, as these were; concerning the strength of the
   horse, the Lord says to Job, chapter 39:19. "Hast thou given the horse
   strength; hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?" Believers are
   strong, not in themselves, but in Christ; their strength lies in their
   head, and in their union to him; they can do nothing of themselves,
   but" can do all things through Christ, which strengtheneth them;"
   having strength communicated to them from him, they can endure all
   hardships, go through all difficulties, withstand all temptations, and
   perform all duties which he calls them to: and next to their union to
   Christ, the strength of a society and company of believers, or a church
   of Christ, lies in their union and close adherence to each other; they
   are like the bundle of sticks in the fable, which, whilst kept bound
   together, could not easily be broke, but when separated from each
   other, were soon snapped asunder; which consideration should excite
   mutual love among believers, and an endeavor "to keep the unity of the
   spirit in the bond of peace;" by doing which, they will not so easily
   fall a prey to their enemies, but will appear "terrible as an army with
   banners." 8. Horses are of an undaunted courage, especially such as are
   well fed, as these were; an elegant description of the majesty, and
   undaunted courage of the horse, as given by God himself, may be read in
   Job 39:20-25. Believers in Christ "are bold as a lion; whilst the
   wicked flee, whim no man pursueth;" they remain undaunted at all the
   reproaches, threatenings, and menaces of men, and cannot be deterred
   thereby, from the service of Christ; they fear not the wrath of kings
   and princes; neither can confiscation of goods, imprisonment of body,
   racks, tortures, or death itself, scare them from a profession of
   Christ and his gospel; but viewing all these with an undaunted courage,
   say, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" instances of this
   we have in Daniel and his companions, the apostles of Christ, the
   believing Hebrews, whom Paul wrote to, and thousands of martyrs for,
   and confessors of the truth in all ages. 9. These horses were not
   employed in ordinary service, in mere drudgery, but were selected for
   the service of Pharaoh, to run in his chariots. The elect of God being
   called by divine grace, are not, or at least, they should not be
   employed in the service and drudgery of sin and Satan; but being
   subjected to Christ, whom they acknowledge to be their Lord and King,
   are directed and guided by him, into those paths in which he would have
   them go, and so readily, cheerfully, and swiftly, "run the ways of his
   commandments." These are not common, servile horses, which the church
   is here compared to, but royal ones, such that were in the service of a
   king. 10. These horses were not wild, nor loose, running at random, but
   being fitted for service, were joined and coupled together, and so
   peaceably and orderly drew one way; and perhaps, were all of the same
   color, and of an equal size and bigness, which is usual in the chariots
   of princes. The church is not a company of wild and unconverted
   sinners, running loose, and enjoying their carnal liberty; but of
   persons, who, by divine grace, are put under the yoke of Christ, being
   joined together in gospel-bonds, and "strive together for the faith of
   the gospel, worshipping the Lord with one shoulder and one consent;"
   and when they are all of the same faith, of the same mind and judgment,
   speak the same things, and harmoniously agree together, without
   disorders, contentions, and divisions, then may they be said to be like
   "a company of horses in Pharoah's chariots." But,

   III.It may be inquired, why this comparison is made and mentioned here;
   which was, 1. To comfort and support her under the mean apprehensions
   she had of herself, and also to strengthen her against the reproach and
   scandal that was thrown upon her by others; therefore Christ lets her
   know, that tho' she was black in her own eyes, and slighted and
   despised by her mother's children, yet she was glorious in his, for he
   had compared her to a "company of horses," etc. 2. To inform her, that
   she was in a militant state, and that she must not expect much ease and
   rest, which she seemed to be seeking for in verse 7, and therefore he
   would have her know, that this was a time for fighting the Lord's
   battles against sin, Satan, and the world; and for that purpose he had
   "made her as his goodly horse in the battle," (Zech. 10:3). 3. Christ
   having directed her to tread in the "footsteps of the flock," and to
   feed her kids beside the shepherds" tents, would have her consider,
   that she must expect trouble, persecution, and opposition from those
   other shepherds, whose flocks are mentioned as distinct from Christ's,
   in verse 7. and therefore to support her under, and comfort her against
   these, he tells her, that he had "compared her, or made her like to a
   company of horses," stout, strong, courageous, warlike, and victorious;
   and therefore, seeing he had "not given her the Spirit of fear, but of
   power, and of love, and of a sound mind," she should not be discouraged
   and dismayed at these troubles and afflictions that came upon her.

Chapter 1 Verse 10

   Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of
   gold.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word in these words continues to give an account of the church's
   beauty and glory; and that either in opposition to what she had said in
   verses 5 & 6, and assures her, that her cheeks and neck were not so
   black as she imagined; but were like the blushing cheeks of a beautiful
   woman, adorned with jewels, and her fair neck adorned with bracelets,
   necklaces and chains of gold or pearl (see Ezek. 16:11, 12); or else he
   continues the metaphor used in the preceding verse, where he compares
   her to a "company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots" whose bridles being
   richly adorned, having chains of gold hung about their necks, as the
   camels of the kings of Midian had (Judg. 8:26), gloriously set forth
   the beauty of the church; and perhaps, the church's glory under the Old
   Testament dispensation is represented in this verse, and a farther
   increase and display of it under the New Testament dispensation
   promised in the text. And here,

   I.Her cheeks are said to be "comely, with rows of jewels."

   II.Her "neck with chains of gold."

   I.Her cheeks are said to "be comely with rows of Jewels:" the word
   jewels is not in the Hebrew text, but supplied by our translators; and
   the word Torim, translated rows, sometimes signifies turtles, which
   gave occasion to the Septuagint to render the words thus: "How
   beautiful are thy cheeks, as the turtle dove's." R. Aben Ezra thinks
   that the bridles of those horses, to which she is compared, had the
   images of turtles upon them; others, [104] that these were some
   ornaments of women, as jewels and ear-rings, which had the figures of
   turtles upon them, and therefore were called turtles, or turturellas,
   according to Drusius; even as those pieces of money, which had the
   figure of a lamb upon them, are called lambs, Genesis 33:19, Job 42:11.
   Now the cheeks of the church being said to be comely with these, shew
   her innocency and harmlessness, her love, chastity, faithfulness and
   beauty; all which appear in this creature. The Targum renders it
   bridles, and very well refers it to the law given on mount Sinai to the
   people of Israel; which is as a bridle, both to restrain persons from
   sin, who are by nature as the horse and mule, without understanding,
   and also to guide and direct them in the right way, that they may not
   depart from it; and on these bridles were rows of jewels or precious
   stones. The word Tor, which is the singular of this in our text,
   signifies an order, or disposition, and course of things; [105] see
   Esther 2:12, 15 and is not amiss rendered by our translators, rows,
   that is, of jewels, or precious stones; and by them are intended,
   either,

   1st, The precepts of the moral law; [106] which, 1. Are beautifully
   ranked and disposed in order; the precepts thereof are so strictly and
   closely joined together, that he that offends in one point, breaks the
   link, and so is guilty of all. 2. These are so many rows of jewels,
   valuable and excellent, and are "more to be desired than gold, yea,
   than much fine gold." Or else,

   2dly, The ordinances of the ceremonial law; which may be compared to
   rows of jewels, 1. For the variety of them; this law is "a law of
   commandments," of many commandments, "contained in ordinances," which,
   as they were carnal, so they were divers (see Eph. 2:15; Heb. 9:10). 2.
   For the excellency of them, as they prefigured the Lord Jesus Christ;
   it is true, after Christ the substance was come, they were "weak and
   beggarly elements," useless and insignificant; but before Christ's
   coming, they were lively representations of him, exceeding useful to
   the saints, and highly valued by them.

   Now the church's cheeks, that is, the outward face and appearance of
   the church, were comely and desirable in the eyes of Christ, being
   adorned with these rows of jewels; her outward conversation being
   according to the laws of God, she appeared beautiful and delightful,
   for "holiness becomes the house of God" for ever: there was a beauty in
   ceremonial worship; the tabernacles of God were amiable to the saints,
   and the saints themselves were so to Christ, in their attendance on the
   service and ordinances of God: the statutes and ordinances with which
   the external face of the church was beautified, were such as were not
   given to other people during that dispensation; which manifestly shewed
   that God had a peculiar regard for them.

   II.Her neck is said to "be comely with chains of gold." The word gold
   is not in the Hebrew text, but supplied by our translators, and the
   word Charuzim, which is only found in this place, is generally
   interpreted by the Jewish doctors, chains of gold, or jewels and
   precious stones [107] bored through and hung in a string, to be wore
   about the neck. A pearl necklace was in use with great personages; so
   the eldest daughter of Priamus had collo monile baccatum, [108] a pearl
   necklace, which AEneas made a present of to Dido; and such like was the
   chain of gold beset with amber, presented to Penelope by her suitors,
   which shone like the sun. [109] And, 1st, I shall enquire what is meant
   by the church's neck. 2dly, What by those chains of gold, or precious
   stones, with which it is adorned and made comely.

   1st, By her neck may be meant, either the grace of faith, by which the
   church cleaves to Christ the head, and exalts him; this is also
   accompanied with other graces, which are linked together as a chain,
   and is attended with good works: or else, by it is meant the ministers
   of the gospel, [110] who, as the neck, are placed in the most eminent
   part of the body, the church, and are the means of conveying spiritual
   food from Christ the head, to the members thereof. But of this, see
   more on chapter 4:4.

   2dly, By those chains of gold, with which the church's neck is
   beautified and adorned, may be meant, 1. The laws and ordinances of
   God; which the ministers of the gospel, and members of churches should
   be careful to observe; and are, as Solomon says, Proverbs 1:9 "an
   ornament of grace unto the head, and chains about the neck," of those
   who regard them. Or, 2. Those diversities of gifts which are bestowed
   on the ministers of Christ, by which they are made "able ministers of
   the New Testament; and so become useful to many, and appear comely and
   beautiful, both in the eyes of Christ, and of such souls to whom they
   minister." Or, 3. The various graces of the Spirit, with which, not
   only ministers, but all believers are adorned; for as sins and vices
   are so chained and linked together, that where there is one, there is
   all; so the graces of the Spirit are like chains of gold, which are so
   closely linked together, that they cannot be separated, but where there
   is one grace there is every grace, which very much beautify and adorn
   the believerers. This golden chain of grace which is put about the
   church's neck, consists of these ten links: the first is faith, that
   precious pearl and valuable jewel, which is alike precious in all
   saints, as to its nature and object; the fruit of electing love, the
   Father's gift, the Son's grace, and the Spirit's work. The second is
   hope, which is called, "good hope thro" grace;" this carries the soul
   cheerfully through all the difficulties of life, and makes not ashamed
   at death; it is both the Christian's anchor and his helmet; it is
   valuable in its nature, and useful in its actings. The third link in
   this golden chain is love, which is "the fulfilling of the law;" this
   is highly valued, by Christ, see chapter 4:10, and is of so great a
   price, that if a man "would give all the substance of his house for it,
   it would utterly be contemned," chapter 8:7. The fourth is humility;
   which is, in "the sight of God, of great price;" and the believer,
   being clothed with it, appears very beautiful and comely; it is a
   sparkling gem in this necklace. The fifth is patience, which is of
   exceeding use in the believer's life, much recommends his character and
   profession, and is greatly taken notice of by Christ (see Rev. 2:2, 3,
   19). The sixth is self-denial, which is required of, and should be in
   exercise in all Christ's followers, but seldom appears in its luster
   and splendor, being frequently sullied by carnal and selfish principles
   and actions. The seventh is contentment in every state of life; this is
   an exceeding great rarity; few persons are possessed of this jewel; the
   apostle Paul had it, as appears from what he says. "I have learned in
   whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content." The eighth is a saving
   knowledge of Jesus Christ; this is eternal life itself, and is by
   believers preferred to all the things of this life; who, with the
   apostle, "count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge
   of Jesus Christ, their Lord." The ninth is long-suffering and
   forbearance, whereby saints are not easily provoked, and do readily
   forgive those who have offended them; this gives great grace, and is
   exceeding ornamental to the believers. The tenth, and last link in this
   golden chain is sincerity; this runs through all other graces, and
   makes them so glorious as they are; this was exceeding bright, and
   shone with a great deal of luster in Nathaniel, of whom Christ said,
   "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile." Or, 4. Those
   blessings of grace which are laid up in an everlasting covenant, come
   through the blood of Christ, and are communicated to all his people,
   may be meant by these chains; they go inseparably together; where a
   person is blessed with one, he is blessed with all; for though our
   interest in them may be gradually discovered to us, yet are we blessed
   at once, "with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ."
   Not one of these links can be broken; this golden chain of grace and
   salvation is excellently described by the apostle, when he says (Rom.
   8:30), "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he
   called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also
   glorified;" where we may observe, how all the blessings of grace are
   inseparably linked together; and which being put about the believer's
   neck, must needs make him look very beautiful and comely.

Chapter 1 Verse 11

   We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having described the church's comeliness in the former
   verse, as she was beautiful under the legal dispensation, with the
   precepts of the moral and ceremonial law, and with that measure of
   grace which was then bestowed on her, proceeds in this verse to promise
   in his own, and in the name of the other two persons, a greater glory,
   and a larger measure of grace unto her, under the gospel dispensation.
   And,

   I.The thing promised is, to "make her borders of gold, with studs of
   silver."

   II.The persons by whom this is to be performed, who are more than one;
   "We will make thee," etc.

   I.The thing promised is, that she shall have borders of gold, with
   studs of silver" made her: some read it, "turtles of gold:" the
   Septuagint render it "similitudes, or likenesses of gold"; [111] and it
   is probable they mean the images of some things, perhaps turtles, which
   might be wrought in silver studs, with pieces, or plates of gold, which
   also R. Aben Ezra seems to intimate; others translate it, "rows of
   gold", [112] as in the former verse, it being the same word which is
   used there; our translators render it borders, respecting the borders
   of garments, where the Jews wore their fringes, and which, in Christ's
   time, the Pharisees, who were ambitious of being esteemed more holy
   than others, wore very large. Now a promise of golden borders may here
   intend the glorious righteousness of Christ; that golden and silver
   studded work of his, that raiment and needlework and curious piece of
   embroidery, with which the church and all believers are beautified and
   adorned; in which the church, the queen, stands at the right hand of
   the King, the Lord Jesus Christ, as one clad in gold of Ophir.
   Moreover, by these "borders, or rows of gold, with studs of silver,"
   may be meant, either, 1st, The ordinances of the gospel, which are far
   preferable to those under the law; the church's cheeks and neck were
   comely with these rows and chains, under the legal dispensation; but
   these are not said to be rows or chains of gold; the words jewels and
   gold are not in the original, but supplied by our translators, as has
   been there observed; but when he speaks of gospel-ordinances, which he
   would appoint, and his church should enjoy under the
   gospel-dispensation, he makes mention of gold and silver; as the Lord
   does in the prophecy of Isaiah, when he is speaking of, and promising
   glory to the church in those times, saying (Isa. 60:17), "For brass, I
   will bring gold; and for iron, I will bring silver; and for wood,
   brass; and for stone, iron." Gospel ordinances are preferable to the
   law: 1. They are more easy, pleasant, and delightful; the ceremonial
   law was a yoke of bondage, and some of the ordinances of it
   intolerable; but Christ's yoke, under the gospel dispensation, "is
   easy, and his burden is light;" those ways were "ways of pleasantness,"
   in which God would have his people walk under the law, much more are
   those which they are directed to under the gospel; if those statutes
   and carnal ordinances were "more to be desired than gold, yea, than
   fine gold," much more are those which believers enjoy now; the
   ordinances of that legal dispensation were servile and slavish, and
   suited to persons who were under a spirit of bondage; but those of the
   gospel became Christ's freemen, to be found in obedience to, and are no
   ways an infringement of their spiritual liberty, but rather an
   advancement of it; these commandments are no ways grievous, but every
   way delightful and pleasant, and are suited to a free, ingenuous, and
   gospel-spirit. 2. They are more lasting and durable; the ordinances of
   the Mosaic dispensation were imposed upon the Jewish church until "the
   time of reformation," that is, until the coming of Christ in the flesh,
   and the oblation of his sacrifice; for when he, the substance of all
   those shadows, was come, they vanished and disappeared; "the middle
   wall of partition is now broken down; the taw of commandments,
   contained in ordinances," is entirely abolished, and the whole economy
   is at an end but the ordinances of the gospel will last till time shall
   be no more; when there will be no more need of such helps as these to
   assist our sight, or such lights as these to direct us in our way; they
   will last till the coming of Christ, till the "sun of righteousness
   arises with healing in his wings:" these are things which will remain,
   till then, unshaken and immoveable; the gospel-dispensation is a
   "kingdom which cannot be moved," in opposition to the legal one, which
   is already moved, and entirely abrogated. 3. They are more clear and
   perspicuous; there was a great deal of obscurity in the legal
   dispensation; the faith of God's children was led to Christ through
   dark representations and cloudy types and figures; but now, under the
   gospel dispensation, we all with open face beholding through those
   ordinances, which we now enjoy, "as in a glass, the glory of the Lord,
   are changed into the same image from glory to glory." 4. They are more
   spiritual; the ordinances of the ceremonial law are called carnal
   ordinances (Heb. 9:10). The external worship of the Jews was attended
   with a great deal of pomp and splendor, but not with so much
   spirituality and power of godliness as that of believers under the
   gospel, who "worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and
   have no confidence in the flesh." 5. The obedience which was performed
   under the legal dispensation, was not so free and ingenuous as this,
   which is performed by believers under the gospel; that sprang from
   fear, and was performed under a spirit of bondage, but this from
   principles of love and grace. Believers, in their obedience to Christ,
   as under the constraints of love, are guided, influenced, and assisted
   by the Spirit of God, who is a free Spirit, or a spirit of liberty; for
   "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." Or else, 2dly, The
   doctrines of the gospel may be here intended; which being "words fitly
   spoken, are like apples of gold in pictures of silver:" these may be
   called "rows, or borders of gold studded with silver;" for the
   doctrines of grace are by the apostle, in 1 Corinthians 3:12, compared
   to gold, silver, and precious stones, as are the doctrines of man's
   invention to wood, hay, and stubble. Now these may be very well called
   "borders of gold studded with silver," 1. For their valuableness; they
   are valued by souls who have tasted the sweetness, and felt the power
   of them, more than "thousands of gold and silver," yea, more than their
   necessary food, nay, more than life itself; they contain riches of
   grace and glory, yea, "the unsearchable riches of Christ." 2. For the
   glory and splendor of them; they give a glorious display of the divine
   perfections, and in a resplendent manner represent the glory of
   Christ's person, office, and grace; and therefore the gospel is called
   the "glorious gospel of God and Christ (1 Tim. 1:11; 2 Cor. 4:4). 3.
   For their being tried ones; "The words of the Lord," says the Psalmist,
   Psalm 12:6. "are pure words, as silver tried in a furnace of earth,
   purified seven times:" they have been tried by saints, and have never
   failed to support and comfort them, nor to guide and direct them in the
   right way; they have been tried by enemies, and have stood the brunt of
   all their rage, malice, and persecution. 4. For their durableness: they
   are as lasting as "borders of gold studded with silver." Attempts have
   been made to destroy the gospel, and remove it out of the world, but
   have all proved abortive; it is an ever-lasting gospel, it is
   immoveable, a burdensome stone to all those who endeavor to subvert or
   remove it; though all things in nature are fading, perishing, and
   subject to change and alteration, yet "the word of God liveth and
   abideth for ever." 5. They may be called "rows of gold," for their
   orderly disposition and connection; there is an entire harmony and
   agreement between the truths of the gospel; one truth has an entire
   dependence upon another, and they have all close connection with each
   other; this is what the apostle calls the proportion or analogy of
   faith, Romans 12:6. 6. The gospel is full of the silver specks or studs
   of exceeding great and precious promises; it abounds with them, and is
   delightfully studded by them; it is filled with such a variety of them
   as are both useful and pleasant to believers.

   Now there being such a display of the doctrines of grace, under the
   gospel dispensation, it appears to be far more glorious than the legal
   one; it is true, the law had a glory attending it, but the gospel has
   an excelling one; the law was "the killing letter, and the ministration
   of death," but the gospel is the ministration of life, "the spirit that
   quickens;" the law is the "ministration of condemnation," but the
   gospel is the "ministration of righteousness;" the law is that "which
   is done away," but the gospel is that "which remaineth," and will abide
   for ever. Or else, 3dly, By these "borders of gold, with studs of
   silver," may be meant the rich and glorious graces of the blessed
   Spirit, and a larger increase of them under the gospel-dispensation;
   which are, 1. Rich and enriching, excellent and valuable as gold and
   silver; nay, grace is "much more precious than gold that perisheth;" it
   is rich in its own nature, and enriches all that are possessed of it;
   therefore, says Christ (Rev. 3:18), "I counsel thee to buy of me gold
   tried in the fire, that thou mayst be rich." 2. The graces of the
   Spirit adorn and beautify a soul, as much, nay, more than "borders of
   gold studded with silver" do the body; on the account of these the
   church is said to be "all glorious within;" and though believers in
   their nature-state were black, like those who "have been among the
   pots," yet being called by, and adorned with the grace of God, are like
   "the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow
   gold." 3. The graces of the Spirit, are us lasting and durable as
   golden borders with silver studs; nay, more so, they shall not perish,
   can never be lost; grace is an immortal and incorruptible seed, which
   remains in the believer, and shall do so for ever. 4. A larger measure
   of grace is dispensed under the gospel-dispensation than was under the
   legal one; it was neither so clearly revealed, nor so largely
   communicated before Christ appeared in the flesh, "full of grace and
   truth," as it was afterwards; and such a larger revelation and increase
   of grace must needs make the church look more glorious under the one
   than it did under the other. Or else, 4thly, These "borders of gold"
   intend the ground-work of a believers faith and hope, which is Christ,
   as "Jehovah our righteousness," who is the only sure and safe
   foundation, and the "chief corner stone;" and the "silver studs" may
   the curious work of sanctification, with all the delightful fruits
   thereof, even those "beauties of holiness" which are so ornamental to,
   and do so much become the believer; Christ's righteousness, imputed to
   us, is the ground-work and foundation of faith and hope; and his grace
   imparted to and wrought in us, is the superstructure that is raised
   upon it; the one the golden "borders," the other the silver "studs."
   Or, 5thly, Souls called by divine grace are meant, even the "precious
   sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold;" and as a great number of these
   being called in, enlarge the borders of the church, so they likewise
   increase the glory of it; this is one way by which Christ "beautifies
   the place of his sanctuary, and makes the place of his feet glorious."
   Or, 6thly, and lastly, The glories of heaven may be here intended; for
   as Christ gives his people grace here, so he will give them glory
   hereafter, which he and the other two persons are preparing and making
   ready for them; and we need not wonder that these heavenly glories are
   represented by "borders of gold studded with silver; when the new
   Jerusalem is described, Revelation 21:18, 19, 21 as a "city of pure
   gold, like unto clear glass, and the street of it pure gold, as
   transparent glass, the wall of it of jasper, the foundations thereof
   garnished with all manner of precious stones, and the twelve gates,
   said to be twelve pearls." Can any thing appear more glorious and
   magnificent than this account of that city, which has "foundations
   whose builder and maker is God?" and those, who are enriched by divine
   grace here, need not doubt of being partakers of the celestial glory
   hereafter. But let us now consider who they are that promise and will
   perform all this. For,

   II.As the things promised are here mentioned, which are "borders of
   gold with studs of silver;" so the persons who promise to make these,
   are intimated in those words, "we will make thee," etc. It is not the
   chorus of virgins, or the daughters of Jerusalem, who here speak; nor
   angels, who are both incapable of and unfit for such an undertaking;
   nor is God introduced here speaking regio more, in the manner of kings
   who sometimes use to speak in the plural number, when they only mean
   themselves; but a trinity of persons is, no doubt, here intended, even
   "the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, which three are one," and
   are jointly concerned in all the works of grace, as they were in the
   works of creation: it is a way of speaking much like that in Genesis
   1:26. R. Solomon Jarchi paraphrases it thus, "I and my house of
   judgment," as he also does Genesis 19:24. Now the ancient Jews by this
   speech meant a trinity of persons, though the modern unbelieving ones,
   as Ainsworth observes, are ignorant of it; yet still retain the phrase,
   and use it as the forementioned Rabbi does, in those places where a
   trinity of persons manifestly appears: for the house of judgment never
   consisted of less than three persons. Now this work may very well be
   ascribed to them; for, 1st, The ordinances of the gospel are the
   institutions of all the three persons; divine adoration is given to
   them in all; and they are enjoined on believers, and are regarded by
   them, as being all equally concerned in authorizing them, and in
   sharing the glory which arises from them; thus for instance, baptism is
   required to be performed "in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
   and of the Holy Ghost," (Matthew 28:19) and accordingly is performed in
   this manner, 2dly, The gospel itself is the work of all the three
   persons; God the Father is the author of it, and therefore it is called
   the "gospel of God," (Rom. 1:1), and so is Christ, hence it is also
   called his, verse 16. and so is the Spirit, and therefore it is called
   "the ministration of the spirit," (2 Cor. 3:8). The grace of all the
   three persons is discovered by it, and the glory of them all concerned
   in it; the Father sends it, Christ is the sum and substance of it, and
   the Spirit powerfully applies it. 3dly, The work of grace upon the soul
   is performed by all the three persons; thus the regeneration and
   quickening of a sinner, "dead in trespasses and sins," is ascribed to
   God the Father, 1 Peter 1:3 to the Son, John 5:21, and to the Spirit,
   John 3:5. 4thly, The increase of grace, which seems to be the thing
   here intended, is owing to them all; thus grace and peace, that is, a
   larger measure of them, is wished and prayed for by John for the seven
   churches of Asia, from all the three persons (Rev. 1:4, 5). 5thly, All
   that glory which saints shall have hereafter, is procured and prepared
   by them all; the Father, he has prepared the kingdom for them from the
   foundation of the world, and it is his pleasure to give it to them; the
   Son he has opened the way to it with his blood, and is gone to prepare
   a place for them; and the Spirit, he is the earnest and pledge of it,
   he discovers the invisible glories of it to them, and will never leave
   them till he has made them meet for, and brought them into the
   enjoyment of them. So that all the three persons, in all these senses,
   may be very well understood as promising to make for the church these
   "borders of gold with studs of silver:" which shews, 1. That believers
   should have a great value for the gospel, and the ordinances thereof;
   seeing they are not only so valuable in themselves, being preferable to
   gold and silver, and are so useful and ornamental to the church, but
   are also the work of all the three persons, 2. That the work of grace
   upon the heart of a sinner, and the carrying it on to perfection, is
   done by an almighty power, and is the work of the eternal Three; the
   renewing of men requires the same power, and is effected by the same
   hands, as the first making of them did; those who said at the creation
   of man, "Let us make man," say at this new creation, and in the
   carrying on and perfecting of the work, "We will make thee borders of
   gold," etc. as they were all jointly concerned in the one, so they are
   in the other, which shows the greatness and glory of it. 3. That all
   these "borders of gold studded with silvers," are made for the comfort,
   glory, and happiness of the church, "We will make thee, or for thee,"
   etc. the whole gospel, with all its doctrines and promises, are given
   for their instruction and consolation; all the ordinances thereof, for
   their comfort and improvement, as well as for God's glory; all the
   grace which is provided in Christ, wrought by the Spirit in their
   hearts, as well as the glory which is laid up in heaven; all, I say, is
   to make them "a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such
   thing."

Chapter 1 Verse 12

   While the King sitteth at his table,
   my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having given very large commendations of his church, and
   promised a great deal of grace and glory to her; she in this and the
   two following verses, declares what advantages she received by him, how
   lovely his person, and how delightful his company were to her. These
   words may be understood either,

   First, Of the time of Christ's not being manifested in the flesh, after
   the promise of it, and of the exercise of the faith, hope, love,
   desire, expectation, etc. of the Old Testament-saints, respecting his
   coming in the flesh: and then the sense is this, Whilst he, who is
   constituted king of saints, is appointed to be the mediator between God
   and man, the promised Messiah and Savior of the world, is With God, as
   "the only-begotten Son in the bosom of the Father," and not yet
   manifested in the flesh; "my spikenard sendeth forth the smell
   thereof," that is, my grace is in exercise; my soul is breathing with
   earnest desires after him; I long for his coming, and am in earnest
   expectation of it; I live in the hope of enjoying this valuable
   blessing; I firmly believe that he will come according to the divine
   promise, though his stay is long, and therefore will patiently wait the
   appointed time. Christ did exist from eternity, as the Son of God; was
   set up as the head and mediator of God's elect, and was appointed and
   constituted king over God's "holy hill of Zion." He bore this character
   throughout all the Old-Testament-dispensation; and being promised to be
   the Messiah and Savior of sinners, from the time of the first
   declaration and publication of it, the Old-Testament-saints lived in
   the faith, hope, and earnest expectation of his coming in the flesh. Or
   else,

   Secondly, They may be understood of the time of Christ's being in the
   temple, or in Jerusalem, or in the land of Judea; during which time the
   gospel was preached, and the sweet odor of it diffused throughout all
   the parts thereof. Christ was promised to come into the world as the
   church's King; "behold thy King cometh," etc. Zechariah 9:9, and as
   such he did come; the wise men of the East sought him under the
   character of "the King of the Jews:" He was accused of making himself
   King, and for it was put to death: Hence this superscription was wrote
   on the cross, "This is the King of the Jews;" though most were ignorant
   of the nature of his office and kingdom, which were "not of this
   world." Now whilst this great King was here on earth, the savor of the
   gospel was spread abroad; it was preached by Christ himself, in the
   temple, in the synagogues of the Jews, and in several parts of the
   land; for he was "not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel:" He sent out his disciples to preach it, but limited them to
   Judea's land, and forbad them to "go in the way of the Gentiles," or
   enter into any of the cities of the Samaritans. So that the sweet odor
   was then confined within that land; though after his resurrection he
   enlarged the commission of his disciples, and bid them go and preach
   the gospel to every creature, beginning at Jerusalem; which they
   accordingly did, and their ministry was owned for the conversion of
   many. but afterwards being rejected by the Jews, they turned to the
   Gentiles; for it was proper and necessary, that the word should be
   first preached to them, that "out of Zion might go forth the law, and
   the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." Or,

   Thirdly, These words may be understood of Christ's being now in heaven,
   whither, after his resurrection, he ascended, where he now is, and he
   will continue till his second coming, "whom the heaven must receive,
   until the times of the restitution of all things;" it is from thence
   that saints expect him: Now these words, "while the King sitteth at his
   table," very well suit with Christ's exalted state in heaven; his
   kingly office and power appear more manifest, he is now declared to be
   "both Lord and Christ;" his posture there is, "sitting at the right
   hand of God," where he is "in his circuit" [113] as the words may be
   read; it being the usual custom anciently among the Jews, to sit at
   table in a circular form (1 Sam. 16:11). Christ being in heaven, is "in
   his circuit," encompassed about with angels and glorified saints; thus
   in Revelation 5:6-11, 12, a large number of angels and saints are said
   to be "round about the throne," (and Christ, the lamb, in the midst of
   them) singing his praises, and feasting with him on those joys which
   will never end.

   Now, whilst Christ is thus solacing himself with saints above, at such
   a distance from his church below, he is not unmindful of her, but gives
   such large communications of his grace, as cause her "spikenard" to
   "send forth the smell thereof:" Which may be meant, either,

   1st, Of the graces of the church being in exercise on Christ: Christ,
   though now in heaven, and so invisible to the bodily eye, yet is the
   object of faith, love, hope, and joy; "whom having not seen, ye love;
   in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy
   unspeakable and full of glory," (1 Peter 1:8). The distance of place no
   way hinders either the communications of grace to us from Christ, or
   the exercise of our grace on him; but while he is there, he is giving
   it forth to us, and we are exercising it upon him; it is the
   manifestation of Christ's love and grace to us that makes our spikenard
   send forth its smell. Or else,

   2dly, The prayers of the saints may be intended by it; which are
   odorous, and of a sweet-smelling savor to God, being perfumed with
   Christ's mediation, and offered up with his "much incense;" and
   therefore says David (Ps. 141:2), "let my prayer be set forth before
   thee as incense." R. Aben Ezra thinks, that by the smell of the
   spikenard, is meant the smell of the incense, which was burnt under the
   law. Now while Christ is in heaven, the saints put their prayers into
   his hands, who takes notice of them, and is always ready, with his
   golden censer, to offer them up to his Father on the golden altar, in
   which he smells a sweet savor; and therefore the prayers of the saints
   are called odors (Rev. 5:8; see also Rev. 8:3, 4). Or rather,

   3dly, This may be expressive of the gospel, and the sweet "savor of the
   knowledge" of Christ, which by it is made "manifest in every place,"
   wherever it comes (2 Cor. 2:14). Now the gospel may be compared to
   spikenard, 1. Spikenard is but a small, low plant or shrub; [114] the
   gospel is mean and contemptible in the eyes of the world; it is
   accounted foolishness by them, and the preachers of it are abject and
   despicable persons in their esteem. Yet, 2. It is very excellent; it is
   by Pliny [115] accounted the chief and principal ingredient in
   ointments; and therefore, John 12:3, the ointment of spikenard, which
   Mary took and anointed the feet of Christ with, is said to be "very
   precious and costly:" The gospel is valuable and excellent, both in its
   nature and effects; it is a rich and an enriching gospel; and therefore
   called "the unsearchable riches of Christ," an exceeding valuable
   treasure, that is put in earthen vessels; it is a revelation and
   declaration of the riches of grace, which Christ bestows upon sinners
   here, and of those riches of glory which saints shall be made partakers
   of hereafter. 3. It is of an exceeding sweet smell, so is the gospel;
   there is such an efficacy in the odor of it, that it enlivens dead
   sinners, and therefore is said to be the "savor of life unto life," and
   will revive the spirits of fainting believers: though it is reported of
   spikenard, [116] that by its being carried over sea it grows moldy and
   rots, whereby it loses its sweet smell, and stinks exceedingly; so the
   gospel, to those that perish, is not only of an ill smell, and abhorred
   by them, but is "the savor of death unto death." Many of the Jewish
   writers [117] understand the smell of the spikenard here as an ill one.
   4. Spikenard is of a hot nature [118] and digestive of cold humours; it
   is hot in the first, and dry in the second degree: The gospel being
   powerfully applied by the Spirit of God, warms the hearts of God's
   children, makes them burn within, and drives away luke-warmness,
   deadness and dullness, occasioned by indwelling sin. 5. It is of a very
   comforting and strengthening [119] nature to the stomach, it
   exhilarates the spirits; so are the doctrines and promises of the
   gospel to the souls of believers; these strengthen and nourish, comfort
   and refresh them; they, like Jeremiah, find the word and eat it, and it
   is "the joy and rejoicing of their hearts." For these reasons the
   gospel may be compared to spikenard; which some of the Jewish [120]
   writers think is musk, others a kind of spice somewhat like saffron;
   but it is best to understand it of nard, of which there are many sorts;
   the best of which is that which grows up in spikes, and therefore is
   called spikenard, which is what is here intended. Again,

   Fourthly, These words may be understood of Christ's feasting with his
   saints here below, during which time their grace is in exercise; there
   is a mutual feasting between Christ and believers, he sups with them,
   and they with him; Christ has furnished a table for his people in this
   wilderness, with plenty, and variety of suitable food; and though he is
   a King, constituted by his Father, and acknowledged by his church, yet
   he sits at this table, with poor, mean, and worthless creatures, and
   welcomes them to those sweet provisions, saying, "Eat, O friends;
   drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved." Moreover, Christ's presence
   with his people, and his grace manifested to them, have a mighty
   influence to draw forth their graces into exercise, even as the rising
   sun opens the flowers, and exhales the odor thereof, and agreeable
   breezes spread it abroad. Thus when the graces of believers are in
   exercise under the influences of Christ, and the enjoyment of his
   presence, they are exceeding odorous, both to Christ and others; their
   spikenard may then be said to "send forth the sweet smell thereof:" On
   this table, which is sometimes called "the table of the Lord," are set
   the body and blood of Christ, whose "flesh is meat indeed, and whose
   blood is drink indeed;" on which believers, being encouraged by
   Christ's presence, and assisted by his Spirit, feed plentifully; and he
   sits there and delights himself by viewing the graces of his own Spirit
   in exercise: thus at this table they are both mutually feasted and
   delighted. Yet there seems to be an emphasis on the phrase his table,
   as if it was a table peculiar to himself; and it was usual with great
   personages, and at grand entertainments, for the master of the feast
   and each of his guests to have separate tables, though together in the
   same room; this was formerly a custom with the Jews though now disused,
   [121] and with the ancient Greeks, [122] and with the old Germans [123]
   also, and it seems with the Romans, [124] but this did not hinder their
   mutual pleasure.

   The conjecture of a certain Expositor, [125] that Christ himself is
   intended by the spikenard, is not to be slighted, he being called a
   "bundle of myrrh," and a "cluster of camphire," in the following
   verses: It was usual in feasts to anoint the head and hair as well as
   feet of persons invited thereunto; and ointment of spikenard was often
   used, [126] as is manifest from Mark 14:3, John 12:3; to this custom
   the Psalmist alludes, Psalm 23:5. At royal banquets in Syria, as this
   here was one, it was usual to go round the guests and sprinkle them
   with Babylonian ointment. [127] Now the church was at table with Christ
   as a guest, and was entertained with the most delicious fare; here was
   nothing wanting to render the entertainment delightful and pleasant;
   Christ himself, as he is both the master and the feast, so he is the
   ointment of spikenard to his guests: and it is as if she should say, "I
   am now at a sweet and heavenly repast with my beloved, he sits at the
   table, and I with him; and as he is my food, so he is my spikenard;
   [128] he is my "all in all;" as long as he is here I need no flowers to
   delight me, no spikenard, myrrh, cypress, or unguents made of these to
   refresh me, for he is all this, and much more unto me." Christ's person
   and grace, his sacrifice, blood and righteousness, are, like spikenard,
   of an exceeding sweet smell; his person is "altogether lovely; the
   savor of his graces or ointments" attract the love of his people; his
   "sacrifice is of a sweet-smelling savor to God," and to all believers;
   his garments, or robe of righteousness, "smell of myrrh, aloes, and
   cassia," and in them believers are acceptable and well-pleasing to God.

   first word church in these words continues the account of that comfort,
   delight and satisfaction which she had in Christ, expressing the
   greatest love and strongest affection for him: and therefore she
   compares him to the very best herbs and spices, and declares that if
   her spikenard, or the graces of the spirit in her sent forth an
   agreeable smell to him, whilst he was at his table, much more grateful
   and odorous was he, being as "a bundle of myrrh" unto her,

   I.Here is a title or character which she gives him; "my well beloved."

   II.What Christ is unto her; "a bundle of myrrh."

   III.The entertainment she is resolved to give him; "he shall lie all
   night betwixt my breasts,"

   I.Here is a title or character which she gives unto him, "my well
   beloved." Ainsworth observes, that the Hebrew word Dodi, which is thus
   translated, is written with the same letters as David is, a name which
   is frequently given to Christ in the Old Testament (see Jer. 30:9;
   Ezek. 34:23, 24; Hosea 3:5). David was a type of Christ, and of him,
   according to the flesh, he came; for he is "the root and offspring of
   David;" as he is God, he is David's Lord; and as he is man, David's
   son; both words, Dodi and David, signify beloved, and both David and
   Christ are beloved of God. "David was a man after God's own heart," and
   Christ his "beloved Son, in whom he is well pleased," and both of them
   beloved of God's people. The Septuagint render it by a word which
   signifies a nephew, [129] a brother or sister's son, Christ is near
   akin to his church, he is partaker of the same flesh and blood as they
   are, is of the same nature with them; they are "members of his body, of
   his flesh, and of his bones;" the Hebrew word Goel, which is frequently
   rendered a Redeemer, signifies also a near kinsman; and being applied
   to Christ; as it is in Job 19:25, shews, that he, who is our Redeemer,
   is also our near kinsman: but the word is very well rendered here, "my
   beloved, or well beloved," and is expressive, 1st, Of Christ's love to
   the church; he is her "well beloved," and has shewn his love by
   undertaking her cause, espousing her person, assuming her nature, and
   dying in her room and stead; which love of his is eternal, free,
   sovereign, unchangeable and unparalleled, and is the strongest motive
   to, and has the greatest influence upon her love to him; therefore she
   may well call him her "well beloved." 2dly, It is expressive of her
   love to Christ, which springs and arises from the manifestations of his
   love to her, for "we love him, because he first loved us;" which love
   was now in exercise in her soul, he being present with her; and
   therefore she gives him this affectionate title as an evidence of it.
   3dly, It shews that she had a sense of her interest in him, and his
   love; a greater blessing a soul cannot be possessed of, than an
   interest in Christ and his love, whose person is "the chiefest among
   ten thousand, and whose loving-kindness is better than life," and all
   the comforts and blessings of it; and next to this is a knowledge and
   sense of it; a soul may have an interest in Christ, and yet not have
   the sense of it; the former renders this state safe and secure, the
   latter makes his life comfortable and pleasant, and is an additional
   blessing and favor; for a person is then able to say, he "hath loved
   me, and hath given himself for me."

   II.She declares that Christ her "well beloved, was a bundle of myrrh
   unto her." By "a bundle of myrrh," we are not, I think, to understand
   the twigs or branches of the myrrh-tree bound up in faggots, which the
   Arabians used to make fires with, the fumes whereof were very noxious
   and pernicious, as the historian [130] tells us, and unless they burnt
   the gum, called storax, would produce incurable diseases; but either
   the little sprigs or flowers thereof bound up together, and put in the
   bosom as a pleasant nosegay to smell to, may be meant; for Christ is
   exceeding sweet and delightful to the believer, being "the rose of
   Sharon, and the lily of the vallies:" or else the gum stacte, which
   springs from the myrrh-tree, and so the Septuagint read it, "a bundle
   of stacte;" or liquid myrrh, which sweats from the tree of its own
   accord, without incision, and is accounted the best: and then by a
   bundle of it is meant a bag, [131] or bottle of it, the same word which
   is used is translated a bag, in Haggai 1:6; Job 14:17, and is an
   allusion to persons who carry bags of perfumes, and sweet powders, or
   smelling-bottles in their bosoms, for the reviving of their spirits;
   now what these are to such persons, that and much more is Christ to his
   church. R.. David Kinchi [132] relates out of Midrash Chazith, that
   Abraham, the father of the faithful, is there compared to myrrh; but
   Christ, who was the object of Abraham's faith and joy, may be much
   better and more aptly compared thereunto [133] which I shall now
   consider. And,

   1st, Christ may be compared to myrrh, if we regard the nature and
   properties of it; it being, 1. An excellent spice, and one of the most
   precious and principal spices; it is reckoned among the chief spices,
   chapter 4:14, and as such Moses is ordered to use it in the anointing
   oil (Ex. 30:23). Christ is "the chiefest among ten thousands," and
   exceeding precious to every believer, in his person, office and grace;
   there is none among the angels in heaven, or saints on earth, so
   desirable to them as he is; nor none who deserves to have the
   preeminence in, and over all things, as he does; seeing he is "the
   image of the invisible God, and the first-born of every creature." 2.
   It is very odorous, it is called "sweet-smelling myrrh," chapter 5:5,
   and the church is said to be perfumed with it, chapter 3:6. Christ, in
   his person, sacrifice, and righteousness, is of a sweet-smelling savor,
   both to God and believers, as has been shewn on verse 12. Believers
   smell a sweet smell in all his offices, characters and relations; he is
   in all these as a bundle of myrrh, exceeding delightful to them. 3. Yet
   it is somewhat bitter in taste, it is gustu leniter amara, as Pliny
   [134] observes; which may be expressive, (1.) Of the sufferings of
   Christ; which, though they were grateful, and of a sweet-smelling savor
   to God, for it pleased the Lord to bruise him; here was not only
   voluntas Dei, the will of God, but here was also voluptas Dei, the
   pleasure of God; yet they were bitter to Christ, witness his agonies in
   the garden, his sorrows on the cross, and the spirtings, buffettings,
   scourgings, and revilings of his enemies; his head being crowned with
   thorns, and his hands and feet pierced with nails; being forsaken by
   his God, and by his friends, could not be grateful and pleasant to him:
   but though these were so bitter to Christ, yet, like myrrh, how sweet
   and odorous is a crucified Christ to believers! They desire to know
   none but Christ, and him crucified; the bitter cup, which he drank, is
   the ground of their joy and triumph; his death and sufferings are the
   foundation of their comfort, and which only can secure them against the
   fears of hell and wrath; it is this which embitters sin unto them; sin
   never appears more odious than in the glass of Christ's sufferings; and
   they never mourn for it in a better or truer sense, than when they
   "look upon him whom they have pierced;" repentance is a tear that drops
   from faith's eye, and is never more evangelic than when faith views a
   sin-bearing and sin-atoning Savior; now from the sufferings of Christ,
   or from a crucified Christ, distil and drop down the sweet-smelling
   myrrh of spiritual blessings, as justification, sanctification,
   adoption, pardon of sin, peace, reconciliation, and a right to eternal
   glory; all which come to us through the blood, sufferings, and death of
   a crucified Jesus. (2) The myrrh, being bitter in taste, though sweet
   in smell, may shew, that the cross goes along with Christ; for as
   Luther says, Christianus estcrucianus, a Christian is a cross-bearer;
   it is required of every one that will follow Christ, that he take up
   the cross; for he that would wear the crown, must bear the cross; and
   he who would have the sweet, must have the bitter; indeed, the
   Christian generally has his share of afflictions, crosses and trials in
   this life. The passover-lamb was eaten with bitter herbs, to shew, that
   he that "will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution;" yet
   so sweet is Christ, this bundle of myrrh, to believers, and communion
   with him, under all afflictions, so delightful, that they would not be
   without him, though they might be freed from them; this tree of life
   sweetens these bitter waters of Marah; they have peace in him, when in
   the world they have tribulation: they are contented with, and rejoice
   in their portion, and are willing to have the bitter, so they may have
   but the sweet; for these bitter afflictions and tribulations which they
   endure for Christ's sake, distil and drop down some precious gums of
   faith, patience, experience, and hope (see Rom. 5:3, 4, 5).

   2dly, Christ may be compared to myrrh, for the use that has been made
   of it. 1. It being very valuable, and highly esteemed of, was used in
   gifts and presents to great persons; thus we find it in the present
   that Jacob made to his son unknown, then governor of Egypt (Gen.
   43:11), and it was part of that which the wise men of the East brought
   to Christ at his incarnation (Matthew 2:11). Christ is the great gift
   of God's grace to sinners, and an unspeakable one he is, which does not
   go alone, for "with him he freely gives all things:" When God gave
   Christ, he gave a manifest proof of his greatness and goodness; he gave
   like himself, and what was statable to us sinners; a favor which we
   neither deserved, desired, nor expected. O boundless grace! amazing
   love! 2. It was used, and was a principal ingredient in the anointing
   oil (see Ex. 30:23); and may signify that "oil of gladness which Christ
   is anointed with above his fellows," which being poured upon his head,
   in its fullness, ran down to all his members, like the oil on Aaron's
   head, which ran clown to the skirts of his garments; for it is from him
   that we receive that "anointing which teacheth all things." 3. The
   stacte, which is the gum that drops from the myrrh-tree, was used in
   the sweet incense (see Ex. 30:34); and may represent the intercession
   of Christ, who stands at the golden altar, with a golden censor in his
   hand, to offer up the prayers of all his people, which he perfumes with
   his much incense; which is exceeding grateful and odorous, like
   sweet-smelling myrrh unto the saints. 4. It was used to render persons
   comely and acceptable in the eyes of others; thus Esther, and the rest
   of the maidens, were purified with oil of myrrh, for their admission
   into the presence of king Ahasuerus (Esther 2:12), it is in Christ the
   beloved, that saints only are accepted with God, being clothed with
   those garments of his, which "smell of myrrh, alloes and cassia:" Thus
   they have liberty of access into God's presence now, and shall have a
   ready admittance into his kingdom and glory hereafter. 5. It was used
   in the embalming of dead bodies, being useful to keep them from
   putrefaction and corruption; for this purpose Nicodemus brought a
   mixture of myrrh and aloes to preserve the body of Jesus, John 19:39,
   40, an interest in Christ, this "bundle of myrrh," and an application
   of him to our souls, will secure us from going down into the "pit of
   corruption," and will eternally save us from perishing; nothing safer
   and better them to have this in our bosoms, without which sinners,
   "dead in trespasses and sins," will rot and putrefy. 6. It is very
   useful in healing [135] wounds and ulcers. Christ is the great
   physician that heals all the diseases of his people, freely, perfectly,
   and infallibly, which he does in an uncommon and unusual way; he
   performs his cures by his blood and stripes; his blood is a panacea, a
   sovereign medicine for all diseases, and "by his stripes we are
   healed," (Isa. 53:5).

   3dly, Christ may be compared to "a bundle of myrrh." 1. To denote the
   abundance of the spiritual odors of divine grace in him, he is "full of
   grace and truth," as a man and mediator; "for it hath pleased the
   Father, that all fullness should dwell in him;" which is communicated
   to believers, as they stand in need of it; who sometimes receive such
   large measures of it, that they can say, "the grace of our Lord is
   exceeding abundant" in them; Christ is "a bundle of myrrh" unto them;
   they have large views of his love, and sweet communications of his
   grace. 2. To shew the security of this grace in Christ; our life is
   sure in Christ's hands, being bound up in the bundle of life with the
   Lord our God, "with all the mercies and blessings of it, both for time
   and eternity; therefore they are called "the sure mercies, of David,
   being hid with Christ in God, so that they can never be taken away from
   us. 3. To shew the inseparableness of Christ and his grace; Christ and
   the blessings of his grace never go separate; where God gives his Son,
   he gives all things with him; and where a soul enjoys Christ, he
   possesses all things; peace, pardon, righteousness, and life are all in
   Christ; and the believer is blessed with all spiritual blessings, in
   heavenly places in him.

   Now Christ is not so to all persons, only to them that "believe he is
   precious," and to none but them; Christ is a "bundle of myrrh" to none
   but his church; "my beloved, is unto me, etc.; which shews not only the
   strength of her affection to Christ, the value that she had for him,
   and the delight she took in him; but also a particular application of
   him by faith, to her own soul; which is also expressed in the following
   verse, "my beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire, etc."

   III.In these words we have also the entertainment which she resolves to
   give him; "he shall lie all night betwixt my" breasts:". Wherein is to
   be considered, 1st, The place she appoints him, "betwixt her breasts."
   2dly, How long we would have him lie there, "all night.", And, 3dly,
   For what ends and purposes.

   1st, The place allotted Christ by the church is, "betwixt her breasts."
   R. Aben Ezra understands by them the two cherubim., or the midst of the
   camp of Israel; R. Solomon Jarchi, the two bars of the ark; [136] but
   it would be much better to understand them either of the two
   Testaments, the Old and New, which are both full of Christ, where he is
   to be found, and does abide; or else of the two ordinances of the
   gospel, baptism and the Lord's supper, which may be called the church's
   "breasts of consolation;" see chapter 4:5; in these ordinances Christ
   shews himself, and grants his presence to his people: or rather by
   Christ's lying "betwixt her breasts," is meant his dwelling in her
   heart by faith, than which nothing, is more desirable to the saints;
   they have no better room than their own hearts, and therefore are
   desirous that he would lodge there; as Christ lays them in his bosom to
   testify his love to them, so they would have him dwell in their hearts
   to testify their love to him; and a wonderful condescension it is in
   Christ, who is "the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity," to
   take up with such a residence as this. So R. Alshech explains the
   phrase "betwixt her breasts," of being "in her heart."

   2dly, The time she mentions, is all night; by which may be meant the
   night of affliction, temptation, etc, it being in Christ alone that she
   could meet with any relief or comfort, under such dispensations; or
   else it means that she would have him with her, not as a stranger,
   sojourner, or guest for a short time, but would have him dwell in her
   heart, lie in her bosom, and grant her intimate communion with.
   himself, all the night of this life, until the everlasting day of glory
   breaks: communion with Christ here is frequently interrupted, which the
   church had a long experience of, to her grief and sorrow: and therefore
   she desires to enjoy it without interruption.

   3dly, The ends and purposes for which she was desirous that he should
   lie all night betwixt her breasts, were, 1. For ornament; sweet flowers
   in the bosom are ornamental and are placed there often for that
   purpose. Christ "the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys," being
   carried in the hand of faith, or in the bosom of love, exceedingly
   adorns the believer. 2. For delight, pleasure, and refreshment;
   nosegays are carried in the bosom, to delight the eye and refresh the
   spirits. Nothing more delightful to the eye of faith than Christ; and
   nothing more savory and of a sweeter smell to a believer, than his
   person, blood, and righteousness; the most delightful and
   sweet-smelling flowers fail short of expressing Christ's beauty and
   savor. 3. That she might always have him in her eye, mind, and memory;
   persons out of sight are too apt to be forgotten, even our dearest
   friends and best enjoyments: The church had, no doubt, some experience
   of this, and therefore to remedy it, she would have Christ, this bundle
   of myrrh, always in her bosom, and in her sight, to contemplate upon
   and wonder at; as the Psalmist did, who says (Ps. 16:8), "I have set
   the Lord always before me." 4. That she might keep him safe; thus
   persons often put things into their bosoms; which they would not lose;
   she had often lost a sight of Christ, and been without an enjoyment of
   his presence, which had given her a great deal of uneasiness; and for
   the future was therefore resolved to be more careful in keeping him,
   and for that reason would have him lie in her bosom. 5. To shew her
   singular value for Christ, and her invaluable chastity to him; she sets
   him in the highest places and gives him the best entertainment; she
   gives him admittance where she would allow none else; he, and none but
   he, "shall lie all night between nay breasts;" these were inaccessible
   to any but to Christ.

Chapter 1 Verse 14

   My beloved is unto me at a cluster of camphor, in the vineyards of
   Engedi.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having had such sweet communion with Christ at his
   table, verse 12, which excited and drew forth her grace into exercise,
   enters into a commendation of him, verse 13, and finding so much
   sweetness in him, she scarcely knew what was excellent enough to
   compare him to, that thereby she might express his excellency, in
   himself, his usefulness to her, and that delight and pleasure which she
   took in him; having declared that he was "a bundle of myrrh" to her,
   which she desired might always have a place in her bosom, she does, in
   these words, compare him to "a cluster of camphor."

   I.She gives him the same title or character as before; "my beloved."

   II.Says that he was, to her, "as a cluster of camphor in the vineyards
   of Engedi."

   I.She gives the same title or character to Christ here, which she had
   in the former verse, "my beloved;" which teaches us, 1. That Christ
   being once the believer's beloved, is always so; he has always an
   interest in Christ, and can never lose it; it is true, he may not
   always have the manifestations of Christ's love, but he has always an
   interest in him, as his beloved; for nothing can "separate him from the
   love of Christ." 2. This shews, that her faith in him, and her love
   towards him, still continued; these two graces are never separate; they
   are implanted in the heart at one and the same time; they grow up and
   increase together, "faith works by love;" they continue together, and
   can never be lost; they are not indeed always alike in exercise, but
   they are always in being; but here they were in exercise as before, and
   rather increased, while she was contemplating and commending her
   beloved's excellencies. 3. From hence it appears, that she was not
   ashamed of Christ under this character, and therefore she repeats it,
   and indeed she had no reason: for her Maker was her husband, "the Lord
   of hosts is his name, the God of the whole earth shall he be called;"
   he had more reason to be ashamed of her, she being a poor, sinful, and
   despicable creature in herself, and he the Creator of all things, and
   the holy One of Israel; and indeed, she was so far from being ashamed
   of Christ as her beloved, that she took a pleasure in looking on him,
   and conversing with him as such. 4. Her repeating it, shews not only
   the vehemence of her love to him, but also the singular esteem that she
   had for him; that he was her beloved, and none else; that she chose,
   approved of, and valued him above all others; he was to her "the
   chiefest among ten thousands," and preferable to all other beloveds.

   II.She compares him to "a cluster of camphor in the vineyards of
   Engedi:" it is somewhat puzzling and perplexing to interpreters, to
   know what this copher, which is translated camphor, was.

   First, It is, by the Septuagint, rendered Cyprus, by which is meant
   either the island so called, of which we read, Acts 11:19, 20 and 27:4,
   and then we must understand, by "a cluster of Cyprus," a cluster of the
   grapes of those vines which grew in Cyprus, which were the best and
   largest vines, as [137] Pliny observes; and these being said to be in
   the vineyards of Engedi, mean either those vines that were brought from
   Cyprus, perhaps, in Solomon's time, and planted in the vineyards of
   Engedi; or else, some of the best vines in the land of Canaan, which
   were much like to those in Cyprus: The land of Canaan was very fruitful
   of vines, and some of the best sort, which bore very large dusters;
   such an one was that which was carried by. two men upon a staff, who
   were sent by Moses to spy the land, Numbers 13:23, 24, in memory of
   which the place from whence it was taken was called Eshcol, the same
   word that in this text is rendered a cluster; and it is highly
   probable, that those vines, which grew in the vineyards of Engedi, were
   the best of all: R. Solomon Jarchi relates, out of the Agadah, [138]
   that these vineyards brought forth fruit four or five times a year, and
   R. Alshech says seven times. Now Christ may be compared to a cluster of
   grapes, which grew in these vineyards; he compares himself to a vine
   (John 15:1), and therefore may be very well compared to a cluster of
   grapes that grew upon the vine. And that,

   1st, For the number of berries that there are in a cluster of them. 1.
   In Christ is a cluster of divine and human perfections; "in him
   dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily; every divine
   perfection is to be found in him; eternity, immutability, omniscience,
   omnipresence, omnipotence, etc. are as it were in a cluster in him: and
   as all divine, so all human perfections are in him; for he is perfectly
   man, as well as perfectly God; he is "God manifest in the flesh;" he
   was made in all things like unto us, sin only excepted, which is the
   greatest imperfection of human nature. 2. In Christ is a cluster of all
   spiritual graces; he is "full of grace and truth;" he is full of grace
   to communicate to others, as Mediator and has all grace habitually in
   his human nature, God having not given "the Spirit by measure" to him;
   for he is "anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows;" a
   cluster of the graces of the Spirit, which are in the human nature of
   Christ, may be seen in Isaiah 11:1-3. The Jews used to call such men
   who had all excellencies and virtues in them, twlwkça esbcoloth,
   clusters; hence they have a saying [139] that"" after the death of Jose
   Ben Joezer, a man of Tzereda, and Jose Ben Jochanan, a man of
   Jerusalem, the clusters ceased, according to Micah 7:1" and say they
   [140] "what is lwkça esjcol, a cluster! why say they, "it is wb lkhç
   çya ish shehaccol bo, a man that has all things in him," that is, that
   has all virtues, a perfect knowledge of the law, etc. Now Christ is
   such a cluster that has all moral and spiritual perfections in him; all
   virtues and every grace are clustered together in him. 3. In Christ is
   a cluster of all spiritual blessings; all the blessings of the
   everlasting covenant are in his hands, and at his dispose; and saints
   are "blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in him; he
   is the believer's "wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and
   redemption;" there is not a mercy we want, but, is in him; nor a
   blessing we enjoy, but what we have received from him; he is the
   believer's "all in all." 4. In Christ is a cluster of "exceeding great
   and precious promises," all suited to the various cases of God's
   children, and to advance his glory; for "in him are all the promises,
   yea, and in him, amen, to the glory of God by us;" and these look like
   "a cluster" of grapes growing in the vineyards of Engedi."

   2dly, Christ may be compared to a cluster of grapes for the abundance
   of juice that is in them, 1. The cluster is squeezed and pressed, that
   the juice may be obtained; so Christ was "wounded for our
   transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities, under the severest
   strokes of justice, and pressure of his Father's wrath; for "it pleased
   the Lord to bruise him," and all this for our good, that our sins might
   be expiated, our souls comforted, and persons accepted with God. 2. The
   juice squeezed out of this cluster may denote the blood of Christ and
   the efficacy of it; which being "shed for the remission of sin,"
   perfectly procured it; it "cleanseth from all sin," and purgeth "the
   conscience from dead works," and has an influence in our justification,
   and in every other blessing of grace. 3. As the wine, which is the
   blood of the grape, is of a cheering and refreshing nature, so is a
   crucified Christ to a poor sinner; that there are salvation,
   righteousness, peace, and pardon through his blood, for the chief of
   sinners, is a reviving cordial to those that see themselves so, and the
   best and most acceptable news that they can hear of; this is more
   cheering and refreshing than the choicest wine. Or else, By Cyprus is
   meant the Cyprus-tree, [141] which grew upon the banks of the Nile, and
   at Ascalon in Judea, and very probably in the vineyards of Engedi, here
   mentioned, as it did also in the island of Cyprus, from whence,
   perhaps, it had its name. The word Copher is used in the Misnah [142]
   and translated Cyprus; and Maimon and Bartenora [143] say, it is the
   same which in Arabic is called anhla, the Alhenna, and refer to this
   place; and observe, that there are some that say it is the spice called
   the clove. Of the Alhenna Dr Shaw [144] says," this beautiful and
   odoriferous plant, if it is not annually cut and kept low, grows ten or
   twelve feet high, putting out its little flowers in clusters, which
   yield a most grateful smell, like camphor." There seems to have been a
   likeness between the Cyprus-tree and the vine, especially in their
   flowering; and it is said to bear a flowery fruit like a grape in
   flower; and hence as vines when they flower are said to Cyprize, as in
   the Greek version of chapter 2:15, so a bunch of Cyprus-flowers in
   likeness to the vine, is called here a cluster; [145] and with
   propriety is the flower of the Cyprus referred to, since it induces
   sleep; [146] see verse 13. And, 1. The [147] seed of the Cyprus-tree is
   much like a coriander seed, which the manna also resembled (Num. 11:7),
   which was typical of Christ, who is called "the hidden manna," (Rev.
   2:17), being exceeding sweet, delightful, pleasant, and nourishing to
   believers. 2. The [148] flower of this Cyprus-tree which may be chiefly
   designed, is of a white color, and a sweet smell; and may denote the
   purity of Christ's nature, and the innocence and holiness of his life,
   who in both appeared to be "holy, harmless and undefiled;" as also the
   sweet fragrancy of his person, blood, sacrifice and righteousness. 3.
   The [149] leaves thereof are good for the healing of ulcers, etc. "so
   the leaves of the tree of life," which is Jesus Christ, are said to be
   "for the healing of the nations;" that is, for the healing of their
   spiritual maladies and diseases. 4. An excellent [150] oil was made out
   of it; and of this with other things was made an ointment, which by
   Pliny, is called the royal ointment. Christ is by the holy Spirit
   anointed above measure with the "oil of gladness," and is possessed of
   those good ointments which are exceeding savory; and from him do saints
   receive that "anointing, which teacheth all things."

   Secondly, Some [151] think that the Cyprus or Cypirus, of which Pliny
   writes (lib. 21. c. 18), is here meant, which is a kind of rush or
   sword-grass, is of a sweet smell, and has bulbous roots, to which it is
   thought the allusion is here made. And, 1. The smell of it, as Pliny,
   in the place before cited, writes, is much like that of spikenard; and
   for the same reasons that Christ may be compared to the spikenard, in
   verse 12, may he be compared to the cyperus here. 2. The smell of it,
   as the same naturalist observes, makes men vegetiores et firmiores,
   more lively and strong, active and robust: in Christ is all a
   believer's strength, and from him they receive fresh supplies of it;
   and the more they exercise faith on him, the stronger they are; so that
   though they are poor weak creatures in themselves, yet they "can do all
   things through Christ, which strengtheneth them." 3. The root of it, as
   is observed by the same author, is good against the bitings of
   serpents, especially scorpions. Christ, who is "the root of Jesse," was
   typified by the brazen serpent, which Moses, by a divine command,
   erected upon a pole, that every Israelite that was bitten by the fiery
   serpents, might look to it and have a cure, Christ was lifted up on the
   cross, and now is in the gospel, that whosoever looks unto him may live
   and not perish (see John 3:14, 15); he is a sovereign and infallible
   remedy against the bitings of those fiery serpents, within, our own
   sins and corruptions, and of that old serpent without, the Devil.

   Thirdly, Others have thought that a cluster of dates, the fruit of the
   palm-tree, is here intended, which is the opinion of R. Aben Ezra and
   other Jewish writers; and indeed Engedi, as is manifest from Pliny,
   [152] was famous for those sort of trees, as was Jericho, which is
   therefore called the city of the palm-trees (Deut. 34:3), and it is
   very probable that Engedi was called Hazzazon-tamar, as it is 2
   Chronicles 20:2, for the same reason: also the [153] fruit of this tree
   grows in clusters, and is very sweet and luscious, and may be
   expressive of Christ, and the fruits of divine grace, which souls
   receive in clusters from him, and are exceeding sweet to their taste.

   Fourthly, Others think, and particularly Sanctius, that the balsam-tree
   is here intended, which only [154] grew in the land of Judea: this
   place Engedi, [155] was remarkably famous both for that and palm-trees;
   so Origen observes, [156] that Engaddi abounded not so much with vines,
   as with balsams;. the vine-dressers in Jeremiah 52:16 are interpreted
   by R. Joseph, [157] of the gatherers of balsam, from Engedi to Ramatha;
   and places where those trees grew might with propriety be called
   vineyards, since the balsam-trees were like to vines, [158] and were
   cultivated after the manner of vines. [159] From this tree dropped the
   precious balsam, which was of a sweet smell, and of an healing nature;
   to which Christ may be very well compared, who is the great and only
   physician of souls, whose blood is a balsam for every sore, and has
   virtue to cure every disease.

   Fifthly, The word Copher is by our translators rendered camphor, and so
   it is by "Pagnine, David de Ponsis," and others; which [160] is of a
   sweet smell, is a very good remedy against the pains and aches of the
   head, a reviver of the spirits, and a refresher of the brain; and, if
   intended here, may be expressive of that sweet consolation and divine
   refreshment which believers enjoy, resulting from views of acceptance
   in Christ's person, pardon through his blood, and justification by his
   righteousness. Though what we call camphor, seems not to be known to
   the ancients, nor does it grow in clusters; but is the tear or gum, or
   something of a resinous nature, which drops from an Indian tree.

   Sixthly, There is one thing more to be remarked, and that is, that the
   Hebrew word rpk copher signifies "an atonement or propitiation;" and so
   may very well be applied to Christ, who is "the propitiation for our
   sins," and has made full atonement for them by "the blood of his
   cross." Bishop Patrick [161] observes, that the ancient Hebrew doctors,
   by dividing the first word lkça "eshcol a cluster," found out the
   mystery of the Messiah in these words, and considered them as if they
   were read as, rpwk lk çya ish col copher "my beloved is unto me the man
   that propitiates or expiates all things," that is all sins and
   transgressions. In the Talmud [162] it is explained, "He whose all
   things are, has atoned for my iniquity." Both the Targum and R. Sol.
   Jarchi carry it in the sense of atonement, though not as made by the
   Messiah: but it is certain that the great atonement for sin was to be,
   and is completely made by the Lord Jesus Christ, the true Messiah; in
   which appeared a cluster of all the divine perfections, shining in
   equal glory; here grace and mercy, justice and holiness, truth and
   faithfulness, sweetly joined and harmonized together; whereby also a
   cluster of divine blessings was procured and eternally secured to all
   his redeemed ones, such as peace, pardon, justification, etc. all which
   are sweet and comfortable, and fill them with unspeakable joy and
   pleasure.

   Chapter 1

   VERSE 15.

   Behold, thou art fair, my love: Behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves"
   eyes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having spoken in the three former verses of the
   glory, excellency and sweetness, which she saw and experienced in
   Christ; he reassumes his part in this verse, and sets off the fairness
   and beauty of the church. In which,

   I.Is a general assertion that she is fair; "Behold, thou art fair, my
   love: Behold, thou art fair.

   II.A particular instance of her beauty given; "Thou hast doves" eyes."

   I.Here is a general assertion of her fairness: In which we have, 1st,
   The thing asserted, that she is fair. 2dly, An "ecce, a behold,"
   prefixed to it; "behold thou art fair." 3dly, A loving character given,
   "my love." 4thly, The assertion repeated.

   1st, The general assertion is, that she is "fair;" not on the account
   of her good works, or any righteousness performed by her, which is as
   filthy rags and "an unclean thing," as the Targum and R. Sol. Jarchi
   interpret it; but on the account of her being clothed with Christ's
   righteousness, washed in his blood, and sanctified by his Spirit, as
   has been shewn on verse 5.

   2dly, To this general assertion is prefixed an ecce a behold; which is
   sometimes, 1. A note of attention; and may be here designed to stir her
   up more seriously to consider her own beauty, which she had in and from
   him: believers are too apt to keep their eyes upon their blackness,
   sins and imperfections, which fills them with sorrow, weakens their
   faith, and inclines them to diffidence; and though a consideration of
   this is sometimes necessary for the humbling of our souls, and the
   magnifying of divine grace; yet we should not have our eyes so fixed
   upon these things, as to be unmindful of and not regard our perfection,
   completeness, beauty and comeliness, we have in Christ, who is both our
   "sanctification and our righteousness." 2. It is sometimes a note of
   admiration: Christ here, setting forth the greatness and excellency of
   the church's beauty, is introduced wondering at that "comeliness" which
   he himself had put upon her, she being in his eyes "the fairest among
   women;" and much more reason have we to wonder at it, that we who are
   "by nature children of, wrath," whose natures are corrupted and
   depraved, who are both by actual and original sin, black, uncomely and
   deformed, yet are now fair and beautiful in Christ, through his blood
   and righteousness; that we, who were clothed with the rags of sin, are
   now arrayed with "the sun of righteousness; that we who were cast out
   into the open field, to the loathing of our persons, in the day that we
   were born, yet now should be clothed with raiment of fine linen, silk,
   and broidered work," and be adorned with bracelets, chains, jewels, and
   earrings; O stupendous grace! astonishing love! 3. It is sometimes a
   note of asseveration; and may be so used here, to assure her of the
   truth of what he asserted concerning her. Believers are very apt to
   call in question their fairness and completeness in Christ; and to
   indulge themselves in fears, doubts and unbelief about it, especially
   when they consider how full they are of imperfections, sins and spots;
   in the view of which they are very hardly brought to believe, that they
   are "all fair, and there is no spot in them:" Christ therefore to
   remove his church's doubts and fears, banish her unbelief, and
   strengthen her faith, uses this way of speaking.

   3dly, Christ gives his church here a very affectionate title, "my
   love," which has been already considered and explained on verse 9 and
   is here mentioned again to let her know, that she was still the object
   of his love, pleasure, and delight that his love towards her was great,
   strong, lasting, and unchangeable; as also how much his heart was
   ravished with her.

   4thly, This assertion of Christ's, respecting the church's beauty, is
   repeated, "behold thou art fair;" which repetition is, 1. To shew the
   exceeding greatness of it: she was "fair, fair," that is, exceeding
   fair; no such beauty to be found in any as in Christ, he is "fairer
   than the children of men;" and next to him is the church; she is "the
   fairest among women;" it is a superlative, surpassing and excelling
   beauty that she is possessed of. 2. It being repeated, shews the
   reality of it; this is inward and real, and not merely outward, nor
   painted: outward favor is deceitful, and natural beauty is vain; but
   such is not the church's, which is supernatural, spiritual, glorious,
   and perfect. 3. It manifests the great value and esteem which Christ
   has for her, and her beauty, and how much he desired it; none so
   beautiful in his sight as she is; nor any beauty so desirable to him as
   hers; his thoughts are fixed upon, his eyes are sweetly delighted, and
   his heart surprisingly and divinely ravished with it; therefore he
   repeats it here and elsewhere, again and again in this Song. 4. It is
   repeated to shew that she was both inwardly and outwardly fair; she was
   fair, both with respect to justification and sanctification.

   II.He gives a particular instance of her beauty, "thou hast doves
   eyes," or eyes like doves: [163] her eyes are taken notice of, because
   much beauty lies in the eyes, either in the size or color of them;
   [164] and the eyes of doves are observed, because of some distinguished
   properties in them: the dove is a creature which furnishes out much
   matter for poets, which they apply to lovers. [165] By her eyes may be
   meant, either,

   1st, The ministers of the gospel; who are that to Christ's body, the
   church, as eyes are to an human body; and what Job says of himself,
   may, with as much justness, be applied to them: "I was," says he (Job
   29:15), "eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame;" and the
   apostle seems to intimate this in 1 Corinthians 12:16-21. Now these may
   be called the church's eyes, 1. Because as the eyes are placed in the
   eminent part of the body, so are ministers set in the highest post and
   place in the church; and therefore are said (1 Thess. 5:12), to be over
   others in the Lord; and it is as necessary and proper that they should
   be so, as it is, that the eyes should be in the head. 2. As the eyes
   are set there to watch and observe lest any hurt comes to the body, so
   ministers of the gospel are placed in the church for much the same
   purpose; for this reason they are frequently called watchmen, and their
   business represented to be a watching for or over the souls of men
   committed to their care, and to give them warning and notice of any
   danger that is like to befall them; of which we have instances both in
   the Old and New Testament (see Isa. 52:8, 62:6; Ezek. 33:7-9; Heb.
   13:17; 2 Tim. 4:5). 3. They may be called the church's eyes, because
   they pry, search into, and make a discovery of gospel-truths to others;
   for which reason they are called the "light of the world," and more
   especially are the lights of the church: they are the stars which
   Christ holds in his right hand, and. maker. use of to hold forth the
   "word of life" and light to others; they shine not in their own, but in
   a borrowed light; they receive all from Christ; they would not be
   capable of looking into and discovering the precious truths of the
   gospel, nor be able to shew to others the way of salvation, did not the
   Spirit of truth, oJdhlh&gt;sei, go before, lead the way, and guide into
   all truth. 4. As the eyes observe, order, and direct the members of the
   body in their several actions; so the ministers of the gospel, being
   appointed inspectors and overseers, observe the life and conversations
   of the members of the church; and if any thing disorderly appears, in a
   proper way correct, admonish, and reprove them for it; they make it
   their business to teach the whole church all things which Christ has
   commanded; to guide, direct, and instruct them how to behave themselves
   in their whole walk and conversation, both in the church and towards
   them that are without.

   Now these eyes of the church may be very fitly compared to doves, 1.
   For clearness and perspicuity; the eyes of doves [166] are clear and
   sharp, sighted, so are ministers to search and penetrate into
   gospel-truths: it is with much more clearness they behold, and
   plainness they deliver gospel-truths now, than they could under the
   legal dispensation; and there is a time coming, when they shall do it
   with much greater evidence and perspicuity, when "the watchmen shall
   see eye to eye;" though in this imperfect state we know but in part,
   and prophesy but in part, and see through a glass darkly, in comparison
   of that light and evidence, in which those glorious truths shall appear
   to all believers in another world. 2. For their sincerity and
   simplicity; when Christ sent forth his disciples to preach the gospel,
   he bid them be "wise as serpents, and harmless as doves:" those who are
   his faithful ministers, act with all simplicity and godly sincerity,
   and dare not, "as many, corrupt the word of God; but as of sincerity,
   but as of God, in the sight of God, speak they in Christ:" they use no
   artful methods to conceal their principles, and bring off persons from
   the plain truths of the gospel into a reception of erroneous doctrines;
   but they are such who have "renounced the hidden things of dishonesty,
   not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully;
   but by manifestation of the truth, commending themselves to every man's
   conscience in the sight of God:" they are exceeding careful and jealous
   lest souls, who are under their care, and are made their charge, should
   by any means be "corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ." 3.
   For bringing in the olive-leaf of the gospel; Noah's dove brought an
   olive-leaf in its mouth, which was an indication that the waters of the
   flood were abated: the ministers of the gospel bring the good tidings
   of good things; they publish salvation by Christ, and bring the news of
   peace and pardon by his blood, justification by his righteousness, life
   through his death, and acceptance in his person. 4. For those dove-like
   gifts of the Spirit, with which they are endowed, and by which they are
   qualified for that work which they are called unto; there are
   diversities of them, of which one and the same spirit is the author,
   and these being given unto them, make them able ministers of the New
   Testament; so that they become both useful and beautiful. The Jews
   [167] interpret those eyes of the Sanhedrim. Or else,

   2dly, By the church's eyes may be meant the eyes of "her understanding
   being enlightened" by the Spirit of God; and more especially the eye of
   faith, by which a soul takes a view of Christ's glory, fullness, and
   suitableness, and looks unto him alone for life and salvation; which
   may be compared to doves eyes: 1. For the clearness and perspicuity of
   it; the dove, as has been already observed, is a quick and sharp
   sighted creature; the eve of faith penetrates into those things "within
   the veil," brings distant things near, and makes unseen things manifest
   unto the soul; for it is "the substance of things hoped for, and the
   evidence of things not seen:" the things which the eye of nature and
   carnal reason could never take cognizance of, are observed by faith;
   whose object is an unseen Christ, and the invisible things of another
   world, which "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard." 2. For its singleness
   and simplicity in looking only to Christ: the dove [168] is an
   exceeding chaste and loving creature to its mate; the eyes of doves
   look only to their mates, to whom they keep an inviolable chastity:
   faith looks only to Christ, and nothing else; it looks only to his
   person for acceptance with God, and not either to its duties or its
   graces; it looks only to Christ's righteousness for justification, and
   not to its own works, whether they be moral or evangelical, works done
   before or after conversion; it looks only to his blood for pardon and
   cleansing, and not to its tears of humiliation and repentance; it looks
   not to its frames, nor grace received, for its supply and support, but
   to an all-sufficient and inexhaustible fullness of grace in Christ: now
   this is the pure, single, and chaste look of faith, which is so
   pleasant and delightful to Christ Jesus. 3. For finding out, and
   feeding upon the pure and wholesome doctrines of the gospel: the dove
   [169] singles out and feeds upon only pure seed and grain, and rejects
   all other, as not being agreeable and proper food; so a believing soul
   cannot feed and live upon any thing; he cannot live upon the husks
   which swine eat, but upon the "wholesome words of our Lord Jesus
   Christ;" any food will not do, none but the "bread of life and the
   hidden manna;" it is the earnest desire of such a soul, that the "life
   which he lives in the flesh, might be by the faith of the Son of God;"
   he would always live on Christ and with Christ, and cannot be satisfied
   with any thing short of him; for having once tasted "that the Lord is
   gracious," he evermore desires this bread. 4. For the exceeding
   beautifulness of it an Christ's eye; as the eyes of doves are beautiful
   and delightful, so as this eye of faith to Christ, his heart is even
   ravished with it; "thou hast ravished my heart," says he, in chapter
   4:9. "with one of thine eyes:" Christ's eyes, for the beauty and glory
   of them, are said to be, in chapter 5:12. "as the eyes of doves; by the
   rivers of water, washed with milk, and fitly set;" and so are the
   church's here; nothing more beautiful than the eye of faith. 5. For the
   meekness and humility of it; doves eyes are meek and humble, not fiery,
   fierce, and furious, as some creatures", nor proud and lofty as others.
   Faith is a low and humble grace, it takes nothing to itself, but
   ascribes all the glory to Christ; it renders the disposition of a soul
   possessed of it mild and meek, not fierce and cruel, for "faith works
   by love:" a fiery temper, and a furious disposition do not become a
   believer; nor is it either excited or encouraged by faith; which
   promotes a meek, humble, and lowly spirit, of which Christ, the object
   of faith, is the best example, who says, "learn of me, for I am meek
   and lowly in heart;" who checks the furious, and resists the proud, but
   takes delight and pleasure in the humble soul, whose eyes are up unto
   him alone.

Chapter 1 Verse 16

   Chapter 1

   VERSE16.

   Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant; also our bed is
   green.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having heard her own praises in the former verse, and
   being conscious to herself of her sins and infirmities, and that what
   beauty was in her came from her beloved; she, as it were, breaks in
   upon his discourse, and ascribes it all to him; and it is as if she
   should say, Dost thou say that I am fair? thou only art eminently,
   essentially, and originally so; for all the beauty which I am possessed
   of, as it is by way of eminency in thee, so it is derived from thee;
   therefore the praise of it is not due to me, but to thyself, to whom be
   all the glory. In these words,

   I.The same thing is asserted by the church concerning Christ, which he
   had asserted concerning her in the former verse; "behold, thou art
   fair, my beloved."

   II.An addition to it, "yea, pleasant."

   III.That their bed, which belonged in common to them both, "was green."

   I.The same thing is here asserted by the church concerning Christ,
   which he had asserted concerning her, and that much in the same manner.
   For,

   1st, The title which he gave her is, "my love," and that which she here
   gives him is, "my beloved." They seem, not only in these two verses,
   but indeed throughout the whole Song, to be, as it were, attiring to
   outdo each other in their mutual expressions of love; but this title
   has been already explained on verse 13.

   2dly, She asserts of this beloved of hers in the very same words, that
   he is fair; she returns it to him, to whom she judged it more properly
   belonged; whose beauty is natural and essential, hers not so; his
   original and underived, but hers derived from him; his infinite,
   inconceivable, inexpressible, and transcending all others, but hers of
   an inferior nature. Now her returning the same commendation back to
   Christ, shews that she not only looked on her beauty as far inferior to
   Christ's, and not to be mentioned with it; as also that it was derived
   from him; and that if she was in any sense comely, it was through that
   comeliness which he had put upon her; but likewise it shews her modesty
   and humility, as well as the nature of true faith, which gives all the
   glory of what the soul is, or has, to Christ and his grace; its usual
   and common language is, "not I, but the grace of God which was with me,
   and it is by the grace of God I am what I am." Now Christ may be said
   to be fair,

   1st, As he is man; and so he is, both in body and soul, that body which
   was prepared him by the Father, and which was in an unspeakable and
   surprising manner conceived in the Virgin's womb by the power of the
   Holy Ghost, as it was free from sin, so was no doubt free from all the
   blemishes and defects of nature; and in this sense, as well as in some
   other, may he be said to be "fairer than the children of Adam;" and
   more especially he was so at his transfiguration, when "his face did
   shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light;" though what
   with sorrows and sufferings, with tears, dust, sweat, and blood, "his
   visage was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of
   men;" yet now being raised from the dead, and exalted at his Father's
   right hand, is beautiful and glorious; for that same human nature,
   which here below was the ridicule of men, is now the wonder of angels;
   that head which "was crowned with thorns, is now "crowned with glory
   and honor;" and that face which was spit upon, will be the delightful
   object of the saints" everlasting vision, after the resurrection morn;
   when with their bodily eyes they shall gaze on the glory of Christ's
   human nature, who they "shall see for themselves, and not another:" in
   short, Christ's glorious human body will then be the pattern and
   exemplar, to which our bodies shall then be fashioned and made like.
   Moreover, as he is fair in his human body, so likewise in his soul; the
   powers and faculties of which act in an agreeable order, nothing being
   misplaced, nor any disorder in the whole frame or contexture of it,
   being free from all sin, and full of every grace: holiness here appears
   in its beauty, and knowledge and wisdom in their perfection; all which
   were manifest and evident throughout the whole of his life. In short,
   the whole human nature had an immeasurable unction of the Holy Spirit,
   on the account of which he is said to be fairer than others; he was
   "anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows;" grace was poured
   plentifully into his lips, from whence it freely dropped like "sweet
   smelling myrrh."

   2dly, He may be said to be fair, as God-man and Mediator, which I
   suppose is chiefly designed here; for as such, this branch of the Lord
   is exceeding beautiful and glorious in the eyes of believers. For, 1.
   The glory of all the divine perfections is resplendent in him; as such,
   he is "the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of
   his person;" all God's creatures, works, and actions, shew forth the
   glory of his perfections in some measure; but they are no where so
   clearly discerned, nor so gloriously displayed, as they are in the
   person and office of Christ as Mediator; for "the light of the
   knowledge of the glory of God" is given us in the face, or person of
   Jesus Christ; and a glorious, delightful, and ravishing sight it is to
   a believer. 2. There is a mediatorial glory which he is possessed of,
   which makes him look exceeding fair and beautiful; this is what was
   given him before the world began, when he first entered into covenant
   with his Father, became our surety, and was set up as the Mediator of
   God's elect; which, when he had finished his work, he desired might be
   given to him, that is, might be more clearly manifested, and a greater
   display of it given to the world, and is what shall feed the eyes of
   his saints with wonder and pleasure to all eternity. This is what
   Christ desires that they may be with him for, namely, "to behold his
   glory," for then indeed shall they "see him as he is:" now, in the
   glass of the gospel, saints behold a great deal of the glory of Christ
   Jesus, which gives them much pleasure and delight; but this is but
   little in comparison of What they shall be everlastingly indulged with.
   3. Christ appears with much fairness and beauty to believers, as he is
   possessed of all grace; this was the glorious and soul-ravishing sight
   which the evangelist John, together with others, had of him, which he
   takes notice of, saying (John 1:14), "we beheld his glory, the glory as
   of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth;" and what
   makes it still more delightful is, that all this grace is treasured up
   in him for them, that they from "his fullness may receive, and grace
   for grace:" there is every thing in him that souls want, and every
   thing they want they may have from him, for "he is of God made unto us
   wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption," which
   consideration must needs render him fair, beautiful, and delightful in
   the believer's eye. 4. Christ is fair in believers eyes, in all he is
   unto them, or has done and suffered for them; their souls are delighted
   in the views of him, as their prophet to teach and instruct them, whose
   "lips are like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh" of gospel
   doctrines, counsels, and promises; as their priest, who by his active
   and passive obedience, has made full satisfaction to the righteous law,
   an atonement for their sins by his blood, and is now interceding for
   them in heaven, and therefore, his "hands are as gold rings set with
   the beryl; and his legs as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine
   gold;" and as their king, to rule, govern, protect and defend them,
   whose head "is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as
   a raven." Moreover, he is exceeding fair and beautiful in their eyes,
   considered in all the relations he bears to them; as he is their
   indulgent Father, their tender husband, loving brother, and faithful
   friend; and so he is to them, in all that he has done and suffered for
   them: it is an exceeding delightful sight to view him undertaking their
   cause, espousing their persons, assuming their name, bleeding and dying
   in their room and stead, arising again as a victorious conqueror
   sitting at God's right hand, where he ever lives to make intercession
   for transgressors.

   3dly, The same word behold, is prefixed by the church to this
   commendation, as was to the other by Christ, as wondering at that
   beauty she saw in him, and that one so fair should take any notice of
   her; and being affected with his glory herself, she stirs up others to
   a contemplation of it; for all have reason, upon a view thereof, to
   say, "how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty," (Zech.
   9:17).

   II.She not only asserts the same of him as he had done of her, but also
   makes an addition to his character, saying, "behold, thou art fair, yea
   pleasant." This shews the exceeding great value and esteem that she had
   for him, and that she found it difficult to find words fully expressive
   of his excellency; and indeed all words fall short of expressing his
   worth. She was not contented with the former commendation of him, and
   therefore adds another word, striving, as it were, to exceed him in her
   commendations. They were not mere words of compliment she used, for her
   heart and affections went along with them; nay, she labored under a
   difficulty of finding out words, apt, strong, and full enough to
   express the real and just sentiments of her mind concerning him, and
   therefore, as she thought one word was not enough, she adds another,
   "yea, pleasant." 1. The person of Christ is so to a believer: He looks
   pleasantly upon believers with an eye of love and grace, "his eyes are
   as the eyes of doves by the rivers of water, washed with milk, and
   fitly set" upon them, He does not look upon them in a frowning,
   furious, and angry manner, but as having the greatest respect for, and
   taking the greatest delight in them; and whilst they are enabled by
   faith to view him with love in his heart and smiles in his countenance
   their souls are filled with an universal pleasure; for if it is "a
   pleasant thing for the eyes to behold the sun" in the firmament, it is
   much more pleasant to behold the "sun of righteousness arising with
   healing in his wings; to see our acceptance in his person, pardon,
   through his blood, justification by his righteousness, reconciliation
   with God through his atoning sacrifice, and every needful supply of
   grace from his infinite fullness: O how pleasant must Christ be to a
   believer under all these sweet considerations! 2. Christ's covenant and
   promises are exceeding pleasant to them. What can be a more delightful
   sight, than to view Christ as the Mediator, surety, and messenger of
   the covenant of grace; to see all the blessings, and the "exceeding
   great and precious promises" of it, all secured in his hands; as also
   their interest in it, and in him as their covenant-head? so that they
   can say, as David did (2 Sam. 23:5), "although my house be not so with
   God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all
   things and sure: for this; all my salvation and all my desire, although
   he make it not to grow;" it is this will give satisfaction and content,
   under all the troubles and exercises of life, and fortify against the
   fears of death. 3. The doctrines of Christ are pleasant to believers.
   "Pleasant words are as an honey-comb, sweet to the soul, and health to
   the bones;" such are the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus, the
   doctrines of the everlasting gospel; these are sweeter to a believer's
   taste than "the honey, or the honeycomb;" they are saltitary and
   nourishing, and therefore valued by him more than his necessary food;
   he often, with Jeremiah, finds these words, and eats them, and they are
   to him "the joy and rejoicing of his heart." 4. The ordinances of
   Christ are pleasant to them. The commands of Christ are far from being
   grievous, his "yoke is easy and his burden light;" all his tabernacles
   are amiable and lovely, his "ways are ways of pleasantness, and his
   paths are paths of peace," especially when they enjoy his presence,
   have communion with him, and are assisted by his Spirit in an
   attendance on them. 5. Christ's company and conversation are exceeding
   pleasant and delectable; no fellowship like "fellowship with the
   Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ." This is the believer's peculiar
   privilege, his sole delight, and the matter of his glorying: no
   presence like the presence of Christ, "in whose presence is fullness of
   joy; and at whose right hand are pleasures for evermore." Communion
   with angels, and fellowship with saints, must needs be very pleasant
   and delightful to believers; but not to be compared with the enjoyment
   of his presence, who is the head of angels, and the king of saints;
   this is the saints" comfort here, and will be their eternal happiness
   hereafter.

   III.Having thus given this great and glorious commendation of her
   beloved, she asserts that their bed, which was common to them, and
   which made for the glory of them both, green; also our bed is green:
   where we are to consider, 1st, What this bed is. 2dly, Whose it is.
   And, 3dly, What is said of it.

   1st, It will be proper to inquire what is meant by this bed. R. Solomon
   Jarchi observes, that the tabernacle and temple were called so; and for
   this purpose cites Song of Solomon 3:7, 2 Kings 11:2, 3, and so it is
   explained in Yalkut. Theodoret [170] thinks that the scriptures are
   here intended, which are oftentimes the instrumental means of begetting
   souls to Christ (see James 1:18; 1 Peter 1:23). But it seems better to
   understand it of the church itself, and the seat of it; where Christ
   and believers comfortably rest together, enjoy sweet fellowship and
   communion with each other, and where many souls are begotten and born
   again; for "of Zion it shall be said, this and that man was born in
   her."

   2dly, Whose bed is this; she calls it our bed, which denotes a mutual
   property and interest that Christ and believers have in the church; it
   is what the Father has given him, which he has purchased with his
   blood, and is the author and maker of; "behold his bed, which is
   Solomon's:" this he has chosen for his rest, solace and refreshment,
   saying, "this is my rest for ever, here will I dwell." Moreover, it is
   the bed which believers have a right to, and therefore are admitted to
   all the privileges of it; here they enjoy the presence and company of
   Christ their beloved, they have an interest in him; therefore the
   apostle says, "if Christ be yours, all things are yours."

   3dly, It is said of this bed. that it is green, that is, flourishing
   and fruitful; so the word is used in Daniel 4:4, Psalm 52:8, and 37:35,
   and intends either, 1. The fruitfulness of the saints in grace and
   holiness, who being "planted in the house of the Lord, flourish in the
   courts of our God," as trees of righteousness, which are filled and
   laden with the fruits thereof; which is owing to the refreshing dews
   and influences of divine grace. Or else, 2. The numerous increase of
   converts in the church; and so the Targum and R. Sol. Jarchi explain
   it: and it may be an allusion to a custom used in the eastern nations,
   in strewing the nuptial bed with green leaves and flowers; and with the
   Latins, torus, a bed, is so called from tortis herbis [171] from herbs
   writhed and twisted together, and put under the shoulders of those that
   lay on them; and it was usual to strew them with green herbs, grass,
   and leaves of trees. [172] A numerous increase of converts, which makes
   the bed, the church, look so green and flourishing, was frequently
   promised and prophesied of in the Old-Testament; and had a glorious
   fulfillment in the first dawn of the gospel, when three thousand souls
   were converted under one sermon; and will be gloriously and completely
   fulfilled in the latter day, when the church shall say, "the place is
   too strait for me, give place to me that I may dwell."

Chapter 1 Verse 17

   The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are either the words of Christ, inviting the church into
   their house, which was so firmly and delightfully built; or else the
   words of the church, continuing the praise of Christ, and all that were
   about him, or belonging unto him; or rather, they are the words of the
   bride and bridegroom, and the virgins her companions, all joining
   together in a chorus, to set forth the glory and excellency of the
   church. in which may be considered,

   I.What is meant by this house, which they seem to have a common
   interest in, and therefore call it "our house."

   II.What those beams are which are said to be cedar.

   III.What those rafters are which are said to be of fir.

   I.I shall consider what is meant by the "house, whose beams are cedar,"
   and whose rafters are of fir. R. Sol. Jarchi understands it of the
   tabernacle, the glory and praise of which, he thinks, is here set
   forth; and so the Targum refers it to the temple built by Solomon, but
   yet acknowledges that that which shall be built in the days of the king
   Messiah, shall be much more glorious and beautiful. But it is much
   better to understand it, either,

   1st, Of "our house, which is from heaven"; [173] which saints know that
   after their dissolution they shall enter into. The word in the Hebrew
   is in the plural number" our houses," [174] and so may intend those
   many mansions which are in Christ's Father's house, preparing by him
   for all his people for their everlasting entertainment; and the beams
   and rafters of these houses being of cedar and fir, which are trees of
   a sweet smell and durable nature, may represent that fullness of joy,
   and those delightful pleasures which are in" Christ's presence, and at
   his right hand for evermore:" it shews that this "house is not made
   with hands, but eternal in the heavens;" that these habitations which
   Christ has prepared for them, and will bring them into, are
   everlasting; and that that inheritance which they are born heirs unto,
   and shall certainly enjoy, is "incorruptible, undefiled, and fadeth not
   away."

   Now if we suppose these to be the words of Christ, his design then
   seems to be, by commending the endless joys and never-ceasing pleasures
   of the saints above, to raise the affections, and quicken the desires
   of his church after the enjoyment of the same, that they with him may
   enter the nuptial chamber, and spend an eternity in everlasting
   communion with each other: but if they are the words of the church,
   then they seem to intimate the comfortable views she had of the
   heavenly joys, and her interest in them; she knew that when this
   "earthly house was dissolved, she had an house not made with hands,"
   firmly built and delightfully furnished, which she should have
   admittance into, and which is "eternal in the heavens;" as also, the
   earnest desires of her soul to be there; she saw this house afar off,
   what a goodly structure it was, what soul-ravishing delights it was
   filled with, therefore longed to be within the walls of it, and
   "groaned earnestly, being burdened with a body of sin and death,
   desiring to be clothed upon with her house, which is from heaven;
   likewise she seems to speak of this house with the utmost thankfulness
   to her Lord and spouse, and adoration of his grace, that had provided
   so convenient and delightful an habitation for her. Or else,

   2dly, By this house may be meant the church of God here below, which
   seems most agreeable; for so it is called in 1 Timothy 3:15 where the
   apostle promises Timothy to instruct him how he should "behave himself
   in the house of God, which, says he, is the church of the living God,
   the pillar and ground of the truth;" and so believers are said to be
   Christ's house, in Hebrews 3:6, "but Christ, as a son over his own
   house, whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence, and the
   rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end." Now the church may be said to
   be Christ's house, 1. Because it is of his building: the ministers of
   the gospel are instruments in building up his church; but he is the
   great master-builder: the materials of this building are "lively
   stones," which are the saints; but he himself is both the "foundation
   and the corner-stone; it is upon this rock he builds his church, and
   the gates of hell shall not be able to prevail against it." 2. Having
   built it, he dwells in it, and makes it the place of his residence: the
   church is the habitation of all the Three Persons, and particularly of
   Jesus Christ; saints are built up "for an habitation of God through the
   Spirit; they are the temples of the Holy Ghost, and in their hearts
   Christ dwells by faith: the church is the habitation of his holiness,
   and the place where his honor dwelleth; here he delights to be, and
   condescends to shew himself; here souls may expect to find him, and
   enjoy his presence; for he has promised to be here until the end of
   time. 3. Here he eats, feeds, and feasts with his people; it is not an
   empty house he keeps, but having built it, he furnishes it with
   suitable provisions, which are called "the goodness and fatness of his
   house; here he makes a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the
   lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refilled:
   this is his banqueting house," into which he brings his people, and
   sups with them, and they with him. 4. Here he takes his rest with the
   church, his bride: "this, says he, is my rest for ever; here wilt I
   dwell, for I have desired it;" here he solaces himself, and takes the
   utmost delight and pleasure; as houses are not only to feed in, but to
   rest in, so this use does Christ make of his church. 5. Here he lays up
   his treasure, and what he esteems his portion, and the chief part of
   his riches; for "the Lord's portion is his people, Jacob is the lot of
   his inheritance;" the saints are his jewels and peculiar treasure, and
   these he brings into and preserves safe in his house below, until he
   removes them into his house above. 6. As his house, he fills, repairs,
   and beautifies it at pleasure; he fills it with members, and these he
   fills with gifts and grace suitable to their places in this house, for
   he is "ascended to fill all things;" when any breaches are made, he
   makes them up; when it is fallen to decay, he repairs it, by bringing
   in a large number of converts, and beautifies this house of his glory
   with his own presence. 7. He is the master of it, and manages all the
   affairs of it; the key of it is in his hands, and the government of it
   upon his shoulders; he is sole king and ruler here; he enacts laws,
   demands obedience to them, and places officers here to see them put in
   execution; he is "the high priest over this house of God," and
   transacts all affairs between God and his people; he is the great
   prophet that teaches and instructs them; the careful husband and
   indulgent father that provides all for them; in short, "of him the
   whole family in heaven and earth is named;" so that the church may be
   very well called Christ's house.

   But then this house is said to be the church's also; "the beams of our
   house," etc. Saints are the materials of this house; Christ is the
   builder, the foundation, and the corner-stone: but they are the lively
   stones which are laid on this foundation, and so "are built up a
   spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices,
   acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; they have a right to, and are in the
   enjoyment of all the privileges of this house; they are
   "fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;" here
   they are born and brought up, have their food and education; "thy
   daughters shall be nursed at thy side," (Isa. 60:4); here they dwell,
   rest, feed, feast, and enjoy sweet communion with Christ Jesus; and
   therefore they may say, as David did (Ps. 134:4), "blessed are they
   that dwell in thy house, they will be still praising thee;" as they
   have a great deal of reason so to do.

   Also the word being in the plural number, and rendered, our houses, may
   intend the particular churches of Christ, which are all his houses,
   where he dwells; his golden candlesticks, among whom he walks, which
   hold forth the word of light and life to others; and his gardens, where
   he delights to be, eating those pleasant fruits, and feeding among
   those lilies, which grow there; for there is but one "general assembly
   and church of the first-born, which are written in heaven, yet there
   are many particular churches and congregations of saints here on
   earth."

   II.The beams of this house are said to be of cedar. By cedar beams we
   are not to understand angels, who encamp about, protect and bear up the
   saints, and are ministering spirits to them, which is the opinion of
   some; [175] but rather, the ministers of the gospel [176] who may be
   called pillars in Christ's house, as James, Cephas, and John were; who
   by their exemplary lives, savory doctrines, and undaunted courage, add
   much strength and glory to the church of Christ; as by rafters
   afterwards may be meant weaker believers, who have all their proper
   places, work, and usefulness in the house of God: or else, by cedar
   beams may be meant in general, the saints and; people of God, which are
   all beams and pillars in this house, and serve to support it; for being
   "fitly framed, together, they grow up unto an holy temple in the Lord;"
   and being joined and cemented to each other in faith and love, they
   worship the Lord "with one shoulder, or with one consent;" and these
   are compared to cedars in scripture (see Ps. 92:12; Num. 24:5, 6); and
   may be very well compared unto them, 1. For the height and tallness of
   them; the cedar-tree is a very tall tree, as may be learnt from 2 Kings
   19:23, Amos 2:9. The saints, though they are mean, abject, poor, and
   low by nature, even beggars on the dunghill, yet by divine grace they
   are raised on high, set among princes, and made to inherit the throne
   of glory; they are higher than others in their gifts and graces, faith,
   knowledge and experience, as well as in their privileges and
   attainments; they are growing up higher still in their head Christ
   Jesus, and are reaching forwards and upwards in their affections and
   desires, in hope of enjoying "the prize of the high calling of God in
   Christ Jesus." 2. For their straightness and uprightness; for which
   reason perhaps the righteous are said to grow, not only like the
   palm-tree, but also like the cedar in Lebanon: the saints are upright,
   both in heart and conversation; they both speak and walk uprightly. 3.
   For its durableness; Pliny [177] ascribes even eternity unto it; it is
   used for immortality; [178] it will not rot, nor admit any worm into
   it: the saints will endure for ever; for though they have much
   corruption in them, yet they themselves shall never corrupt; they have
   that grace in them which will keep them from putrefaction, and which
   will never decay itself; for it is incorruptible, immortal, and
   never-dying seed. 4. For the sweet odor which it sends forth; [179] it
   is of an excellent smell; so are the persons of the saints to God the
   Father, being clothed with the garments of salvation, and robe of
   Christ's righteousness, which "smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;" so
   are the graces which are wrought in them by the Spirit to Christ
   himself; see chapter 4:10, and so are all their sacrifices of a
   sweet-smelling savor, being offered up in Christ's name, and perfumed
   with the sweet incense of his mediation. 5. The cedar-tree is well
   rooted, [180] always green, and the older the more fruitful: believers
   are rooted in Christ Jesus, so as all the winds and storms of sin and
   temptation cannot tear them up; they are always green, and their leaf
   doth not wither, because they are "planted by rivers of water;" where,
   being refreshed with continued supplies of divine grace, they bring
   forth fruit in old age, because the Lord, he is upright, he is their
   rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.

   III.The rafters of this house are said to be of fir. By rafters may be
   meant the ordinances of the gospel, which are administered in the
   church, and are for the comfort and edification of it. The Hebrew word
   here, translated rafters, is in Genesis 30:38-41 and Exodus 2:16
   rendered gutters and troughs of water, where sheep used to be watered;
   and some of the Jewish writers [181] would have it understood in this
   sense here. R. Aben Ezra observes, that if it is taken in this sense,
   then the word rendered fir, should signify marble stone, and be read
   thus, "our canals are of marble stone." [182] Now these canals or
   gutters of water are called µyfjr rehatim [183] from the Chaldee word
   fhr rehat, which signifies to run, because waters run in them. The
   grace of the Spirit is frequently, both in the Old and New Testament,
   represented by water; which, for its purity and purifying nature, is
   called clean water; for its quickening virtue and efficacy, water of
   life and living water; and for its plenty and abundance, "rivers of
   water:" this grace is commonly conveyed and communicated to us in the
   use of ordinances; these are the canals or conduit-pipes in which this
   water rune, and is brought unto us; the first conveyance of it is
   usually this way; faith, conversion, and every grace that attends it,
   come by hearing, and hearing by the word of God; and as this, so other
   ordinances are the means of increasing faith, joy and comfort, and of
   conveying fresh supplies of grace and strength. Christ's fullness is
   the fountain from whence all grace springs; and his ordinances are the
   golden pipes, through which the golden oil and grace of divine love run
   and empty themselves into our souls. Also the same word is translated
   galleries, in chapter 7:5, "the king is held in the galleries." R.
   David Kimchi says, [184] that they were buildings in high houses, in
   which they walked from house to house, or from one part of the house to
   the other; they were such as our balconies: and they may be called by
   this name, because they run along the sides of houses: agreeable to
   this, Junius and Tremellius translate it, ambulachra nostra, our
   walking-places. Now the ordinances are the galleries, or
   walking-places, where Christ and believers walk and converse together;
   here he grants them fellowship with himself, tells them all his mind,
   and discloses the secrets of his heart unto them: in these galleries
   they behold "the king in his beauty;" here he shews them his
   covenant-love and grace, and from hence they take a prospect of the
   good "land that is very far off." But the word may be very well
   translated rafters, which are joined together, and run in each other;
   and so the Targum renders it; and in this sense is the word used both
   in the Misnah [185] and in the Midrash. [186] Now as rafters are for
   the strength and support of buildings, so are the ordinances to the
   church of Christ; by them oftentimes saints are supported and
   refreshed; and, whilst they are waiting on Christ in them, they renew
   their strength, they mount up with wings as eagles, they run and are
   not weary, they walk and faint not, as it is promised to them in Isaiah
   40:31.

   Now these rafters are said to be of fir. The word is only used in this
   place, and is so rendered by Arias Montanus, Pagnine, and others, and
   is so understood by most of the Jewish writers; [187] the word being by
   the change of a single letter, to wit, ç into t, which is used in the
   Chaldee and Syriac languages, the same with that which is commonly used
   for the fir; and this, Pliny says, [188] is the best and strongest wood
   for roofing or faltering": now these rafters, the ordinances of the
   gospel, may be said to be of this, because, 1. The fir-tree is hilaris
   aspeceu [189] of a pleasant, cheerful, and delightful look; the
   ordinances of the gospel are exceeding delightful to believers, when
   they have the presence of Christ with them, and the communications of
   his love unto them; then are those tabernacles amiable and lovely;
   wisdom's ways are then ways of pleasantness; their souls are filled
   with joy and pleasure; nothing so desirable to them as these, neither
   does any thing give them such satisfaction and contentment; and
   therefore with the disciples they think it is good for them to be here,
   and would always abide under such a roof as this, whose rafters are of
   fir. 2. It is a very shady, tree, folio pinnato densa, ut umbres non
   transmittat; [190] at is so thick with leaves, that it will not let
   through showers of rain: the ordinances of Christ are a delightful
   shade, under which saints oftentimes sit with pleasure, have much
   spiritual consolation and refreshment; in which, being protected from
   the enemies of their souls, they serve the Lord with liberty and
   enlargement of heart. 3. It is always green, [191] and never casts its
   leaf, and therefore is called the "green fir-tree," in Hosea 14:8.
   Ordinances are those green pastures, into which the great Shepherd
   leads his sheep, and in which he causes them to lie down; which being
   blessed and owned by the Spirit of grace unto believers, make them fat
   and flourishing, fruitful in every good work, even in old age; so that
   their leaf does not wither in the winter season.

   Others think that the cypress-tree is here intended, and so read the
   words, and our rafters or galleries of cypress; so the Septuagint,
   Vulgate Latin, and Tugurine versions, David de Petals, and others. Now
   these rafters may be said to be of this wood, because the cypress-wood
   [192] is very lasting and durable; it admits of no worms, it will not
   rot, nor is it sensible of old age; which may be expressive of the
   durableness and continuance of gospel ordinances, until the second
   coming of Christ; for as long as Christ has an house on earth, these
   cypress-rafters will last, it will never need new roofing; as long as
   there is a church, there will be those ordinances, Which are now in
   force, and will continue so to the end of time, without any change or
   alteration in them. This wood is also of a very pleasant smell; [193]
   which may signify the delight and pleasure which believers take in
   ordinances, and how grateful they are to them.

   Others think that the brutine-tree is meant; so Ainsworth, Brightman,
   Junius, Cocceis, and Michaelis; and it may be that which Pliny [194]
   calls bruta, which some take to be the tree of Paradise; and its name
   is near in sound to the Hebrew word brotim here used, the singular of
   which is brot; which, Pliny says, is much like the cypress, and of a
   smell like cedar; and being applied to the ordinances of the gospel,
   may signify, as before, the durableness and delightfulness of them; and
   now who but would desire to dwell in such an house, and under such a
   roof as this? What encouragement is here, and what an inducement should
   this be, to souls to come into the house of the Lord, and wait upon him
   there, the beams of whose house are cedar, and the rafters of fir?

   Chapter 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Here begins a new colloquy between Christ and his church; in which they
   alternately set forth the excellencies of each other, and express their
   mutual affection for, and the delight and pleasure they take in each
   other's company. Christ seems to begin, in an account of himself and
   his own excellencies, and of the church in her present state, verses 1,
   2. Then she in her turn praises him, and commends him above all others;
   relates some clear proofs she had of his love to her, and communion
   with him in his house and ordinances, to such a degree as to overcome
   her, verses 3-6, and then either he or she gives a charge to the
   daughters of Jerusalem, not to disturb either the one or the other in
   their sweet repose, verse 7. Next the church relates how she heard the
   voice of Christ, and had a sight of him on the hills and mountains at
   some distance; then more nearly behind her wall, and through the
   lattices, verses 8, 9, and expresses the very words in which he spake
   to her, and gave her a call to come away with him; making use of
   arguments from the season of the year, the signs of which are
   beautifully described, verses 10-13, and requests that she would come
   out of her solitude, that he might enjoy her company, whose countenance
   and voice were so delightful to him; and gives a charge to her and her
   friends, to seize on such as were hurtful and prejudicial to their
   mutual property, verses 14, 15, and she closes the chapter with
   expressing her faith of interest in Christ; and with a petition for his
   speedy approach to her, and continued presence with her, verses 16, 17.

Chapter 2 Verse 1

   I am the rose of Sharon; and the lily of the valleys.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word begins a new colloquy between Christ and his church, in
   which they alternately set forth the praises and excellencies of each
   other, discover the strength of their mutual affection, and express the
   delight and pleasure they take in each other's company: but who begins
   this colloquy is not so easily determined. What is here said, may he
   applied either to Christ or to the church; and therefore I shall
   consider the words in both senses.

   First, The words may be considered, as the words of the church,
   expressing the excellency of her grace, loveliness, and beauty, which
   she had received from Christ; and at the same time intimating her being
   exposed in the open field and low rallies to many dangers and enemies;
   and therefore tacitly desires his protection over her, which he seems
   to promise in verse 2. That these are the words of the church, seems to
   be the general opinion of the Jewish doctors, [195] and is also
   embraced by some Christian interpreters. [196] And,

   1st, The church may be compared to "the rose," 1. For beauty; it is
   called the beautiful flower [197] its color is beautiful and
   delightful: the figure is exceeding just; nothing is more common in
   poems of this kind, than to set forth the beauty of women by the rose;
   such as Hero, [198] Aspasia, [199] and others; some have had the name
   of Rhoda from hence; and Helena for her beauty was called Podocrwv.
   [200] The church may be fitly compared to it; no "rose of Sharon" can
   be more beautiful in color, and delightful to the eye, than the church
   is in the eyes of Christ; as she is clothed with his pure and spotless
   righteousness, adorned with the graces of his Spirit, and standing at
   his right-hand in cloth of gold, bespangled with the sparkling gems of
   divine grace; her beauty is desirable to him, she being in his eye "the
   fairest among women." 2. For its sweet odor; [201] the church and all
   believers are as the fragrant and sweet-smelling rose; their persons
   are so as considered in Christ; and all their graces, especially when
   in exercise; and all their duties and services, when performed in
   faith, and perfumed with Christ's mediation (see chapter 4:10, Phil.
   4:18; Revelation 5:8, 8:3, 4). 3. For its delight in sunny places;
   [202] it thrives and flourishes the best there, and has the most
   fragrant smell: Christ is "the sun of righteousness," under whose
   warming, comforting and refreshing beams, believers delight to be, and
   under which their souls grow, thrive, blossom exceedingly, and bring
   forth much fruit. 4. For its blossoming and flourishing, "the desert
   shall rejoice and blossom as the rose;" the church may be said to do
   so, when there is a large increase of members, and these much in the
   exercise of grace, and "fruitful in every good work;" then may the
   church be said to be as the blossoming rose.

   2dly, She may be compared to the "lily of the rallies:" some women have
   their name from the lily, as Susanna; and so Sysigambis is the name of
   the mother of Darius [203] which signifies the white lily [204] to
   which for beauty women are sometimes compared; and with propriety
   enough may the.155 church be called a lily. [205] She is compared to
   the "lily among thorns" in the next verse, and saints are frequently
   compared to lilies in this Song. And, 1. She may be likened to a lily
   for the glory, beauty and sweet odor of it. Christ says (Matthew 6:29),
   of the lilies of the field, that "Solomon in all his glory was not
   arrayed like one of these;" and for the same reasons that she is
   compared to the beautiful and sweet smelling rose, is she likewise to
   the lily; which Pliny [206] says, rosae nobilitate proximum est, "is
   next in nobleness and excellency to the rose." 2. For its whiteness;
   there are various sorts of lilies, and they are of different colors;
   some are of red and purple colors, others are white; and it seems to be
   the white lily which is intended here, for this seems best to express
   her beauty; for the red rose and the white lily make her look somewhat
   like her beloved, "white and ruddy," a perfect beauty; and of the white
   lily, Pliny [207] says, candor ejus eximius, that "its whiteness is
   singularly excellent; the church, and all believers in Christ, are very
   aptly resembled by the white lily, who are clothed with "fine linen,
   clean and white, which is the righteousness of the saints," wrought out
   by Christ, imputed by God the Father, and laid hold on by faith; this
   is so exceeding white, that being arrayed with it, they are all fair,
   and "there is no spot in them." 3. For its fruitfulness; Pliny [208]
   says, nihil est foecundius, us radice quinquagenos saepe emittente
   bulbos: "nothing is more fruitful, for oftentimes one root sends forth
   fifty bulbs:" and as fruitful are believers when the Sun of
   righteousness shines upon them, and Christ is as the dew unto them; for
   then "they grow as the lily, and cast forth their roots as Lebanon;
   their branches spread, and their beauty is as the olive tree." The
   church brings forth many souls to Christ; and these bring forth much
   fruit, to the glory both of him and his father. 4. For its height, for
   which it is commended: the lily grows very high; Pliny [209] says, nec
   ulli florum excelsitar major, interdiu cubitorum trium; "no flower
   exceeds it in height; for in the day-time," (that is, when it erects
   itself,) "it is three cubits high." Believers are trees of
   righteousness; and plants of Christ's Father's planting, which do not
   run along the ground, and cleave to earthly things, but lift up their
   heads heavenwards, and grow up on high in their desires and affections,
   having their hearts above, where their treasure is: believers are like
   the flowers of the lily, open towards heaven, but shut towards the
   earth. 5. For the weakness of its body, and largeness of its head:
   Pliny [210] says of the lily, languido semper collo et non sufficiente
   capitis oneri; that it has "a weak neck, or body, which is not
   sufficient to bear the weight of the head." Christ is the head of the
   body, the church, and far greater than that; he is not supported by it,
   but he supports it: the church's strength lies in her head, as Samson's
   did in his locks; she is weak in herself, but strong in Christ her
   head, and therefore says, "surely in the Lord have I righteousness and
   strength." 6. The church may be compared, not only to a lily, but to "a
   lily of the valleys:" there is a lily which is called lilium
   convallium, "the lily of the valleys:" but this seems not so much to
   intend the distinguishing name of some particular lily, as it does the
   place where it grows. And, 1. Valleys are low places; and, when the
   church is called "the lily of the rallies," it may be expressive of the
   low estate and condition which she is sometimes in: believers are
   Christ's myrtle-trees, and these are sometimes in the bottom, in a low
   condition; but he grants his presence with them, and the discoveries of
   his love to them; they are his doves, and they are often "like doves of
   the rallies, mourning every one for their iniquity, being humbled and,
   pressed down in their souls under a sense of sin and unworthiness; they
   are not only humble in themselves, and low in their own eyes, but are
   often in the deeps of affliction, sorrow, and distress, and out of
   these depths cry unto the Lord (see Ps. 130:1). 2. Lilies that grow in
   the rallies are exposed to danger; they are liable to be plucked up by
   every one that passes by, to be trodden upon, and eaten by the beasts
   that feed there, and also to be washed away, and destroyed by hasty
   showers of rain, that run from the hills and mountains down into the
   valleys with force and violence; so the church of Christ here on earth,
   in her low estate, is exposed to the rage of her adversaries, to be
   trodden under the feet, and torn in pieces by the teeth of those bulls
   of Bashan, that beset her around, and to be carried away by the flood
   of persecution, which "satan the old serpent casts out of his mouth
   after her." Now it is a glorious instance of God's mighty grace and
   power in protecting and defending his church, that this lily grows and
   abides in the rallies, notwithstanding all this danger. 3. Lilies of
   the rallies have more moisture, verdure, and greenness in them, than
   those upon the hills and mountains; because the sun has not that power
   over them, as R. Sol. Jarchi observes, to scorch and dry them up, and
   therefore are much more beautiful and excellent: so believers, being
   planted by "rivers of water," are green, flourishing, and fruitful;
   whilst others look like "the heath in the desert," dried and parched
   up. Christ is to the saints as "rivers of water in a dry place, and as
   the shadow of a great rock in a weary land;" by the one he refreshes
   them, and makes them fruitful; and by being the other he shades from
   that which would scorch them, and make them barren and unfruitful: and
   thus is the church the "lily of the valleys," as well as "the rose of
   Sharon." And the Targum here renders it, "the rose in the plain of the
   garden of Eden;" and some interpreters think the rose is meant; and we
   sometimes read of roses in valleys [211] and certain it is there were
   roses in the vale of Sharon. But,

   Secondly, The more commonly received opinion is, that these words are
   the words of Christ, owning all the glory and praises the church had
   given him in the former chapter, and setting forth more largely the
   beauties and excellencies of his person, the more to affect, enamor,
   and ravish her soul, and make her seek and long for him: and indeed it
   seems best to understand them of Christ, for self-commendation does not
   so well agree with the church as with him. What Solomon says (Prov.
   27:2), is worth regarding, "let another praise thee, and not thine own
   mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips:" though it is lawful for the
   saints to speak of their glory, beauty, and excellency, as considered
   in Christ, in order to magnify the riches of his grace, for the
   instruction and encouragement of others, and in vindication of
   themselves against the calumnies of the world, and to obviate their
   mistakes concerning them, as in chapter 1:5, she says, "I am black but
   comely;" but her chief province and design in this Song appears to be,
   to set forth his praises, and not her own; and indeed the majesty and
   agreeableness of the stile with Christ's language in the New Testament,
   such as, "I am the door, I am the good shepherd, I am the vine, I am
   the way, the truth, and the life," etc. as well as the connection of
   the words with the following verse, as one well observes, [212]
   manifestly bespeak them to be the words of Christ, who may very well be
   called,

   1st, "The rose of Sharon." Christ fitly compares himself to a rose,
   which, as Bishop Patrick observes, is still one of the goodliest things
   to which a great prince can be likened in those Eastern countries; and
   gives an instance of it in the great Mogul complimenting one of our
   kings, as being like a rose in a garden: in the Misnah, [213] mention
   is made of the king's lily, or the king's rose, being the king of
   flowers, and fit for a King, and an emblem of one; so the men of the
   great congregation of Ezra are compared to roses, in the Targum of Song
   of Solomon 7:2 and the ancestors of Melissus the Theban, after many
   calamities, are compared to the flourishing rose, for the height of
   honor and power they arrived unto [214] Nor is this simile unfitly used
   by the bridegroom of himself, since it is sometimes given to men by
   their lovers;" [215] and is very properly used in a Song of love, as
   this is; seeing the rose, as Philostratus calls it, is erwtov futon,
   the plant of love; and Anacreon calls it to rodon twn erwtwn, the rose
   of loves: it was sacred to love; the graces are represented, one of
   them as having a rose, another a myrtle-branch; [216] and a crown of
   roses was consecrated to the muses; [217] all this because of the
   beauty and loveliness of the plant. And to it Christ may be compared,
   1. Because of its red color; which may be expressive of the truth of
   his humanity, and signify that he is really and truly man. having
   "taken part of the same flesh and blood," that his people are partakers
   of; as also of his bloody sufferings in the same nature, on the account
   of which he is said to be "red in his apparel:" likewise both these
   together, the red rose and the white lily, make up that character which
   is given him, chapter 5:10 that he is "white and ruddy," a compleat
   beauty, like the charming lily and blushing rose, "fairer than the
   children of men." 2. He may be compared to the rose for its sweet
   smell, as for the same reason he is in the former chapter to spikenard,
   myrrh, and camphire; his person, sacrifice, grace and righteousness,
   have a delightful odor in them; no rose smells so sweet, as Christ does
   to believers; this Sharon-rose refreshes them, quickens their spiritual
   senses, and ravishes and delights their souls. 3. The rose is of a
   cooling nature, [218] and therefore useful in burning fevers,
   inflammations, etc. Christ, by the effusion of his blood, by the
   oblation of himself, and by his dying in the room and stead of sinners,
   has appeased and removed his Father's fierce and burning wrath from
   them; and it is only an application of this Sharon-rose, the person,
   blood and righteousness of Christ, which can cool and comfort the
   conscience of a sinner set on fire, and terrified by the law of God;
   the discoveries of his love and grace can only remove those dreadful
   terrors, and fire of divine wrath, which is kindled by a "fiery law,"
   and cure those inflammations raised thereby. 4. He is called "the Rose
   of Sharon," for the excellency of it; the roses which grew there
   perhaps were the best of any. Sharon is the name of a fruitful plain or
   country, where herds and flocks were kept, as appears from 1 Chronicles
   27:29, Isaiah 35:2, and 65:10; this plain or country lay between
   Caesarea and Joppa, beginning at Lydda; hence they are joined together
   (Acts 9:35), and reaching to the Mediterranean sea: hence the Jews in
   their writings say [219] from Lydda to the sea in the vale; and this
   was so very fruitful, that the Targumist on this place renders it, "by
   the garden of Eden:" and Sharon is described in the Jewish map [220] as
   fat and fertile, having in it very desirable fields, fruitful vines,
   and abounding with flowers and roses. There are various sorts of roses
   in different places, some better than others; those of the first class
   with the Greeks [221] were those of Olenum, and next those of Megara
   Nisea, and then those of Phaselis, and then of others; with the Romans,
   the best were those of Praeneste and Campania, and then others: [222]
   but of the roses in Judea, the rose of Sharon seems to have been the
   best, and therefore to that the comparison is made; there was a garden
   of roses in Jerusalem [223] but not to them, but to those in Sharon is
   the allusion. The word for a rose is only used in this place and in
   Isaiah 35:1 and is so called, either from the collection and
   compression of leaves in it, or from the shadow of it; for the word
   seems to be compounded of one that signifies to hide and cover, and
   another that signifies a shadow; so Gussetius [224] and so may be
   rendered, "the covering shadow:" but why a rose should be so.called is
   not easy to say; unless it can be thought to have the figure of an
   umbrella, or that the rose of Sharon was so large as to be remarkable
   for its shadow, like that Montfaucon [225] saw in a garden at Ravenna,
   under the shadow of the branches of which more than forty men could
   stand. Christ is sometimes compared to trees for their shadow, which is
   pleasant and reviving, as in verse 3 (Hosea 14:7), but he here seems to
   be compared to the rose of Sharon on another account, even the
   excellency and fragrancy of it; for, Pliny says [226] that the rose
   does not delight in fat soils, rich clays, or well-watered grounds, but
   thrives the best in poor lean ground; and that those are of the
   sweetest smell which grow in dry places, for ruderatum agrum amat, "it
   loves rubbish earth." Now such dry and rubbish earth was that which was
   about the city of Sharon; for we read of such a place as inhabited
   (Acts 9:35), as the Talmudic doctors assert; who also tell us [227]
   that those who built a brick house in Sharon, had no benefit of the
   law, mentioned in Deuteronomy 20:3 because the earth thereabout was not
   fit to make bricks of, nor would houses made of them continue long.
   Hence they also say [228] that the high priest, on the day of
   atonement, prayed particularly for the Sharonites, that their houses
   might not become their graves. Now these being the best and sweetest
   roses which grew in this soil, and Christ being compared to one of
   them, denotes the excellency and preferableness of Christ to all
   others.

   Some [229] think that some other plant or flower is here intended; the
   Targum renders it, "the narcissus;" of which some are white, having
   white leaves surrounding a yellow flower [230] and some of a purple
   color [231] and which Pliny [232] calls purple lilies: he says [233]
   there are two sorts of them, one that has a purple flower, and the
   other is of the grass kind; some, he says [234] have a white flower and
   a purple cup. The heathens used to call the narcissus the ancient crown
   of their superior deities [235] and it was reckoned a beautiful flower,
   and of a sweet smell [236] and for beauty Christ may be compared unto
   it: its white color may denote the purity of Christ; and the purple,
   his royalty, or rather his purple blood and sufferings of death. The
   Septuagint translate the words thus, "I am the flower of the field;" as
   do also the Vulgate Latin and Pagnine. Now Christ may be called so, 1.
   Kat ejxochn, by way of eminency, as being the chiefest and most
   excellent flower in the field; there is no such flower in the heavenly
   paradise as he is; among all the holy angels and glorified saints,
   there are none to be compared with him; and in his garden here below,
   no such flower grows as this; he is "the flower," the choicest, the
   best, and the most excellent in the whole field or garden. 2. The
   flower of the field is liable to be plucked up or trodden under feet by
   beasts; Christ was exposed to the rage and fury of his enemies, those
   strong bulls of Bashan" of which he complains (Ps. 22:13, 14). This
   sweet flower was laid hold on by "wicked hands," and cropped; and still
   his precious person, blood and righteousness, are slighted, contemned,
   and "trodden under foot" by Christless and unconverted sinners. 3. This
   may be expressive of the meanness of Christ in the esteem of the world;
   a field-flower is little regarded; Christ is as "a root out of a dry
   ground," and therefore they say, "he hath no form not comeliness, and
   when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him:
   hence he is despised and rejected of men," they not knowing the real
   worth and value of this precious flower (see Isa. 53:2, 3). 4. The
   flower of the field is not of man's planting, nor is it raised by his
   care and industry: Christ was conceived in the womb of a virgin, and
   born of her without the help of man; as the flower of the field, he had
   no father but his Father in heaven, and no mother but the virgin on
   earth; and so was Melchisedek's antitype, "without father as man, and
   without mother as God." 5. The flower of the field is open to all;
   whoever will may come to Christ for life and salvation; there is
   liberty of access to all sorts of sinners, to come to him and partake
   of his sweetness and benefits; he is not a flower in an enclosed
   garden, that cannot be come at, but stands in the open field; every
   sinner that labors under a sense of sin, and is heavy laden with the
   weight and burden of it, may come to him, and not fear a rejection from
   him; he is not "a fountain sealed, but opened to the house of David,
   and inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness."

   2dly, Christ may be very well compared to "the lily of the valleys," 1.
   For its whiteness; the lily, as has been already observed, is exceeding
   white, which may intend the purity and holiness of Christ, who both in
   nature and life is "holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from
   sinners; he is the lamb without blemish and without spot," without the
   blemish of original or spot of actual sin; for he never knew it in his
   nature, nor did he ever commit it in his life, either in thought, word,
   or deed: or else the whiteness of the lily may signify his eternity;
   for so his head and his hairs are described by John (Rev. 1:14) to be
   "white like wool, as white as snow;" which represents him as the
   ancient of days, and as existing from everlasting to everlasting. 2.
   For its tallness; the lily grows up very high, as has been taken notice
   of Christ, as mediator, is "the rock that is higher than we are; from
   whence the waters of divine grace flow, to the refreshment of our
   souls, when overwhelmed "he is higher than the kings of the earth; nay,
   he is higher than the heavens," and all the angels there; for he is
   "set far above all principality and power, and night, and dominion, and
   every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that
   which is to come." (Eph. 1:21). 3. For its fruitfulness; the lily is
   very fruitful, as has been before observed. Christ is "filled with all
   the fruits of righteousness," and is possessed of all the blessings of
   grace; he is like a tree richly laden with fruit, and therefore is
   compared to an apple tree, in verse 3. all the church's fruit and
   fruitfulness come from him; he is the green fir-tree, from whom all her
   "fruit is found." 4. He may be compared to the lily for its excellency
   and glory; it being the next flower to the rose, and which is preferred
   by Christ to the glory of Solomon. Christ is the brightness of his
   father's glory; is now, in our nature, "crowned with glory and honor;"
   and will shortly appear in his own glory, and in the glory of his
   Father, and of the holy angels. 5. He may be said to be the lily of the
   valleys, because of his wonderful humility and condescension, in
   assuming our nature, suffering in our stead, and in humbling himself
   unto the death of the cross for us; his whole life was one continued
   series of humility, as was his death an undeniable instance of it:
   Christ here on earth did not appear as the lofty cedar, but as the
   lowly lily, and that not of the mountains, but of the valleys; and it
   is with humble souls he delights to dwell; for though he is the high
   and lofty one, in his divine nature, yet he condescends to dwell with
   such who are of an humble and contrite spirit.

Chapter 2 Verse 2

   As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word it may not be so evident whose are the former words, whether
   Christ's or the church's, yet these manifestly appear to be his: and if
   we take the preceding verse as the words of the church, then we may
   consider this as the words of Christ, either owning and confirming what
   she had said of herself in it; as that she was indeed the most
   beautiful of all the roses and lilies which grew in fields and rallies,
   and that all others were but like thorns and briars when compared to
   her; and also, at the same time that he owns and commends her beauty,
   puts her in mind of her present state and condition in this life, as
   being attended with afflictions, sorrows, and sufferings: or else the
   words may be regarded as the answer [237] of Christ to her complaint in
   the former verse, where she says, that she was indeed the blushing rose
   and charming lily, but then she was as the rose and lily in the open
   fields and valleys, liable to be plucked up by every one that passed
   by, and to be devoured or trodden under feet by the beasts of the
   field; to this Christ replies here, by owning it all to be true, and
   promising that he will keep and preserve her safe in the midst of her
   enemies, "as the lily among thorns;" nay, that her very enemies should
   be her protection, these thorns should be as an hedge about her. But if
   we take the former verse: to be the words of Christ, which seems most
   agreeable, then we are to consider these as his also; who, having in
   the former verse set forth his own beauties and excellencies, which was
   proper to be done in the first place, does in this set forth his
   church's, in which may be observed,

   I.What he compares her to; "a lily among thorns."

   II.The title which he gives her, "my love;" which discovers his regard
   unto her, and affection for her.

   III.Her excellency and preferableness to all others in his esteem.

   I.The church is here compared by Christ to "a lily among thorns." The
   Targum renders it, the rose; and so it is in Zohar; [238] and that this
   is intended, some strenuously contend for, which, and not the lily,
   they say, grows among thorns: Ainsworth would have what we call the
   woodbind or honey-suckle here meant, which grows in hedges; and indeed
   this is sometimes called lilium inter spinas, "the lily among thorns
   [239] to which the church may be compared, because of its sweet smell;
   the flower of it gives an exceeding sweet smell; and makes those fields
   where it grows in abundance very delightful: believers in their
   persons, grace, and conversation, are like the "smell of a field which
   the Lord hath blessed;" being clothed with the sweet-smelling garments
   of Christ's righteousness, and anointed with the savory ointments of
   the Spirit's grace. Also the woodbind or honey-suckle cannot bear up
   itself, but has its dependence on others; it does not grow up erect,
   but for its support wraps itself about the body, branches and twigs of
   other trees, convolvens se adminculis quibuscunque, as Pliny [240]
   observes; therefore we call it woodbind, from its binding about other
   trees; and for the same reason it is in Greek called periclymenon,
   which is also used by Latin writers: believers are weak, and cannot
   support themselves, and therefore by faith lean on Christ, who is their
   beloved; and are upheld by him with the right-hand of his
   righteousness; they cleave close unto him, and depend upon him for all
   grace here, and for glory hereafter. But the word will very well bear
   to be translated a lily, being the same that is so in the former verse;
   where it has been shewn in what sense the church may be compared to
   one; and therefore I shall only observe, 1. That Christ and the church
   bear the same names; Is he a lily? so is she; the church being married
   to Christ, and they too becoming one flesh, have one and the same name;
   hence the church is called Christ (1 Cor. 12:12), so the same name,
   Jehovah, our righteousness, which Christ is called by (Jer. 23:6), is
   given to her in chapter 33:16. Again, Christ is called Israel, Isaiah
   49:3, which is the name of his church and people; for being espoused
   together, and having partook of each other's natures, they also bear
   each other's names. 2. That there is a very great likeness and near
   resemblance between Christ and his church; for when he says, she is "as
   the lily," he means, she is as himself, who is "the lily of the
   valleys," verse 1. and therefore, as one well observes [241] he does
   not say she is the lily, but as or like the lily; for as he is; so are
   we, that is, believers, in this world. Christ and the church are both
   lilies in God's eye, and are loved by him with the same love: believers
   bear the image of Christ, wear his righteousness, have the same spirit,
   though in measure, and are exposed to the same hatred, malice, and
   persecution of the world, being wounded with those thorns even as he
   was: and they shall be much more like him in another world; for they
   shall then be like him, and see him as he is; they shall then have
   everlasting and transforming views of him, which will change them into
   the same image, from glory to glory; for as they will then have more
   communion with him, so they will have a greater conformity to him, who
   is "the first-born among many brethren." 3. That all the church's
   beauty and loveliness come from Christ: it is because he is the lily,
   that she looks like one; her beauty is not natural to her, but is
   derived from him, who is her head and husband; she is indeed a perfect
   beauty, but then it arises from that comeliness Which he has put upon
   her.

   Moreover she is not only said to be as the lily, but "as the lily among
   thorns." By thorns may be meant, 1. Wicked and ungodly men, sons of
   Belial, which are "as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken
   with hands," (2 Sam. 23:6) these, like thorns and briars, are the curse
   of the earth; are worthless and unfruitful in themselves, and hurtful
   and grieving to the saints: David, Isaiah, and others have complained
   of them; righteous Lot was pricked with these thorns; his soul was
   vexed and grieved from day to day with their unlawful deeds: also like
   thorns, their end is to be burned, and that by the fierceness and fury
   of God's wrath, who says, in Isaiah 27:4 "Who would set the briars and
   thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them
   together;" which he will do at the last day, when he will bind up those
   thorns in bundles, and cast them into "the lake which burneth with fire
   and brimstone;" where "the people shall be as the burnings of lime; as
   thorns cut up, shall they be burnt in the fire;" the terror of which
   sometimes surprises the sinners in Zion, who therefore say, "who among
   us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with
   everlasting burnings?" (Isa. 33:12-14). 2. By thorns may be meant the
   reproaches, revilings, and persecutions of wicked men, whereby they
   afflict and disturb the saints; the Targum explains these thorns, of
   the wicked edicts and decrees of princes, by which the congregation of
   Israel was oppressed in captivity: the prophet Ezekiel is encouraged by
   the Lord faithfully to deliver his message to the people of Israel, the
   briars and thorns were with him, and though he had his dwelling among
   scorpions, that is, though he was reproached, reviled, and persecuted
   by them for it. Christ's lily in all ages has more or less been
   attended with, and has grown up, among such thorns as these; for every,
   one that will live godly in Christ Jesus. shall suffer persecution of
   one kind or another; and yet they abide like "the lily among thorns,"
   in their faith, purity, and holiness; so that neither the frowns nor
   flatteries of the world can prevail upon them to desert the Redeemer's
   interest, forsake the gospel, nor turn aside from the true worship of
   God; to which agrees R. Sol. Jarchi's gloss on the text, which is this:
   "As the lily among thorns, which prick it, yet stands continually in
   its beauty and redness; so is my love among the daughters, who entice
   her to follow after them, and go a whoring after other gods, but yet
   continues in her religion." 3. By thorns may be meant heretics and
   heretical doctrines, which pierce, prick, and grieve the children of
   God: now these false teachers, these wolves in sheep's clothing, may be
   known by their fruits, which are none at all, that are good for any
   thing; for, "do men gather grapes off thorns, or figs off thistles!"
   there is no fruit of faith, sound doctrine, or a gospel-conversation to
   be found upon them; but are like unfruitful thorns, whom God suffers to
   grow up in his churches, that those which are filled with the fruits of
   righteousness might be made manifest; and in all ages, more or less,
   Christ's lily, the church, has grown up among, and been pricked by, and
   pestered with such thorns as these. 4. The corruptions of our nature
   may be called so: these Canaanites remaining in the land, dwelling in
   our hearts, are pricks in our eyes, and thorns in our sides; these
   grieve and disturb us, and they make us groan with the anguish our
   souls are filled with by them. Perhaps the breaking forth of some
   corruption is intended by the thorn in the flesh, and messenger of
   Satan, that the apostle speaks of, 2 Corinthians 12:7, though the
   temptations of Satan may also be called by these names, which often
   give the saints a great deal of uneasiness, and throw them into much
   heaviness; and it may be that both the corruption of nature, and the
   temptations of Satan, which the apostle might labor under, are
   intended; and the thorn in the flesh may be expressive of the breaking
   out of some corruption; and the messenger of Satan may intend his
   temptations, by which it was stirred up and encouraged: though I rather
   think that both phrases are only expressive of the corruption of
   nature, which was wont to be called by the Jews, the messenger of hell;
   a phrase much like this used by the apostle. So in Mi-rash Hanneelam
   [242] we read that R. Hona, in his sermons, used to advise persons
   thus, "O ye children of men, take care of the messenger of hell: but
   who is this? The evil imagination, (by which the Jews always intend the
   vitiosity of nature) is the messenger of hell. Now this being a phrase
   that was well known, the apostle adds it by way of opposition to the
   thorn in the flesh, as explanative of it, Moreover, worldly cares are
   compared to thorns which choke the word; they are pernicious .to
   saints, and make them barren and unfruitful, as well as grieve and
   disturb them (Matthew 13:22), but tho' Christ's lilies here on earth
   grow up among, and are annoyed by those thorns of sin and corruption;
   yet when they are transplanted into Christ's garden above, "there shall
   be no more a pricking briar, nor a grieving thorn," to give them the
   least disturbance.

   II.Whilst Christ is comparing his church to a "lily among thorns," he
   gives her a loving and affectionate title, my love, which has been
   already explained in chapter 1:9 and his mentioning it here shews, that
   even in her present state and condition she was a beauty in his eye;
   and that her being among thorns, was so far from detracting from it,
   that it rather served as a foil to set it off the more; as also, that
   she was still the object of his love, though in the midst of wicked and
   ungodly men, men of unclean lips and lives, haters of peace, religion,
   and godliness; though she was reviled, reproached, and persecuted. by
   them, yet she was loved, valued, and esteemed by him; nay, though she
   was attended with many infirmities, sins, and corruptions, that were
   grieving to her, and dishonoring to him, yet neither these, nor any
   thing else, should ever separate her from his love: she was Christ's
   love and lily still, tho' among thorns. The lily is often made use of
   in this love-song, to set forth the beauty of the church and of the
   saints in the eye of Christ; and his great love. to them, and delight
   in them, and very justly. [243]

   III.He sets forth her excellency and preferableness to all the
   daughters. By whom we are to understand the nations and men of the
   world; for it is usual in the Hebrew tongue to call the inhabitants of
   countries the daughters thereof; thus we read of the daughters of Tyre,
   Edom, Babylon, etc. none of which are to be compared with the church;
   these are like thorns to Christ's lily: or else carnal, hypocritical,
   and formal professors may be intended, whom she calls in chapter 1:6
   mother's children; who made an external profession of religions but
   wanted that real and internal beauty which she was possessed of, and
   differed only in name from the rest of the sons and daughters of fallen
   Adam; but she, being distinguished by divine grace from them all, was
   preferable to them, 1. In beauty; these looked like thorns, she like a
   lily; they were black and uncomely, she the perfection of beauty, and
   the fairest among women. 2. In harmlessness; though there are thorns
   about, yet none upon the lily: ungodly persons are not only uncomely in
   themselves, but like thorns, pricking and hurtful to others; but as for
   the saints, they are "blameless and harmless, in the midst of a crooked
   and perverse generation," like lilies among thorns. 3. In fruitfulness:
   no fruit grows on thorns, but on Christ's lilies grow all sorts of
   precious fruit; they are laden with them. 4. In their last end Christ's
   lilies will be gathered by himself and his angels, and be put in his
   garden above; but the wicked, which are Satan's tares and thorns, shall
   be bundled together, and cast into everlasting burnings; the one being
   highly valued and prized by Christ. the other hated and rejected by
   him; for as much as the lily exceeds the thorns which grow about it, so
   much does the church of Christ excel the men of the world among; whom
   it is here on earth; and as there is a difference now between them,
   though growing up together, so there will be one, and that far greater
   and more visible when separated; the one will be everlastingly
   glorified, the other everlastingly punished.

   first word having commended the church in the former verse, and
   declared that she was as preferable to all others, as the lily was to
   the thorns; she in this verse returns the commendation to him, and
   asserts that he as much excelled all the sons, as the fruitful
   apple-tree did the wild and barren trees of the wood; [244] and at the
   same time gives an account of that sweet experience she had of his
   excellency, preciousness, and usefulness to her. Now in the words may
   be observed,

   I.A comparison which she makes of him to an apple-tree; in which she
   sets forth his excellency and preferableness to all others.

   II.She instances in two particular things; in which, by good
   experience, she found him to be so to her own soul. First, The shadow
   of this apple-tree was delightful to her; "I sat down under his shadow
   with great delight." Secondly, The fruit thereof was exceeding sweet to
   her; "his fruit was sweet to my taste."

   I.She compares him to an apple-tree, and that no doubt of the best
   sort. The Targum renders it, a pome-citron, or citron-apple, tree:
   which, 1. Is a very large tree; [245] and so may be fitly used to
   express the greatness and excellency of Christ, who is possessed of all
   divine perfections, and is "over all, God blessed for ever." He is a
   Savior, and a great One; who has, as an instance of his great love,
   condescension and power, wrought out a great salvation for great
   sinners. He is an high priest, and he is a great one, both in the glory
   of his person, and in the virtue and efficacy of his sacrifice and
   intercession. He is the king of saints, and as such is higher than the
   kings of the earth: He is equal with God, therefore greater than
   angels, and more excellent than all the sons of men. 2. It is a very
   fruitful tree; it is sometimes so full of fruit, that it is even
   pressed down with the weight thereof [246] and is, as Pliny says [247]
   omnibus boris pomifera, "always hearing fruit:" it has at one and the
   same time flowers, ripe and unripe fruit; whilst some are putting
   forth, others are dropping off; so Christ abounds with the fruits of
   divine grace; he is not the barren fig-tree, but the green fir-tree,
   from whom our fruit is found, and that at all times; for he is that
   "tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit
   every month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
   nations," (Rev. 22:2). Here may believers come at all times, and pluck
   and eat; for here is not any deficiency of fruit, it is always growing,
   always plucking, and yet never lessened. 3. The fruit of this tree
   [248] is of a bitter taste, but of an exceeding sweet smell, as are
   also the leaves; which being put among garments, not only give them a
   delightful odor, but also drive away noxious creatures from them; for
   the same reason is Christ compared to myrrh in chapter 1:13; for tho'
   his sacrifice, death and sufferings, are sweet and savory, both to his
   Father and to his people, yet they were bitter unto him, who not only
   tasted of, but drank up the whole cup of his Father's wrath: and though
   the blessings which spring from hence are of a sweet smell, exceeding
   grateful and delightful to believers, yet are they enjoyed in this life
   with a variety of crosses, afflictions, and: tribulations; this
   passover-lamb is eaten with bitter herbs. 4. It is an excellent remedy
   against poison. [249] Sin is that poison of asps which has infected all
   human nature, and spread itself over all the powers and faculties of
   the souls of men, as well as over all the members of their bodies: now
   Christ is the sovereign antidote against it; this fruit of the
   citron-apple-tree is the most pro, per remedy for it; his righteousness
   justifies, his blood cleanses, and his grace will eternally clear his
   people from their sins. 5. It is very good for shortness of breath, and
   to remove a stinking one; [250] hence the Parthian nobles used to boil
   the kernels of it in their food for that purpose: it is the presence of
   Christ, and communion with him, that only can cure our panting souls
   when we are wearied, and almost out of breath in seeking him; and it is
   the sweet incense of his mediation that perfumes our prayers, which are
   the breath of our souls, and which otherwise would be so far from being
   grateful to God, that it would be strange unto him. And thus may Christ
   be compared to a citron-apple-tree; though perhaps the common
   apple-tree is here intended, which the Talmud [251] interprets of the
   Israelites, but R. Aben Ezra understands it of the Shekinah, as do the
   Targum and R. Sol. Jarchi of the holy and blessed God, and Lord of the
   world; as also does R. Chaya, in the book Zohar: [252] who says, that
   the congregation of Israel set forth the praises of the holy and
   blessed God by an apple, because of its colors, smell and taste; so the
   Cabalistic doctors interpret it of tiphereth, or the bridegroom,
   because of the same. [253] Christ is this Shekinah, the holy and
   blessed God, and Lord of the world, who may be compared to an
   apple-tree, (1.) Because it is a very fruitful tree. There are various
   sorts of fruit which it bears; Christ is full of fruit; he is Joseph's
   antitype, who is called "a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a
   well, whose branches run over the mall:" all the fruits of
   righteousness grow on him, every grace is in him; he is that "tree of
   life which bears twelve manner of fruits;" there are justifying and
   pardoning grace, sanctifying and adopting grace in him; all that a
   believer can want here, and all that can make him happy hereafter: and
   as fruitful boughs bend downwards, being laden with fruit, and may be
   easily reached, so Christ, being full of grace and truth, gives to
   sinners the utmost liberty of access to him for grace from him; for
   though as God, he is "the high and lofty one," yet as man and mediator,
   he is meek and lowly, and condescends to take notice of, and admits
   into familiarity, poor, mean, and abject creatures; he gives them a
   gracious allowance to approach near unto him; that apple-tree, whose
   fruitful boughs of divine grace hang so low, that the hand of faith may
   easily reach them, where the poor sinner is heartily welcome to pluck
   and eat at pleasure. (2.) It is of a very beautiful aspect when laden
   with fruit, and especially as growing among the trees of the forest.
   Some have thought that the fruit of this tree is what was forbidden our
   first parents; which being so "pleasant to the eyes," was a temptation
   to the woman to eat thereof; therefore is in Latin called malum, evil,
   because sin entered into the world hereby: though others think it was
   another sort of fruit. The Jewish writers differ much about it; some
   say it was the fig-tree, so R. Sol. Jarchi, and some others in R. Aben
   Ezra on Genesis 3:6 which they gather from Adam and Eve's immediate
   sewing of fig-leaves together, as soon as they had sinned, to cover
   themselves with: others, that it was the pome-citron, or citron-apple
   tree, so Baal Hatturim in Genesis 1:29 but the same author on Numbers
   5:3, seems to intimate as if it was the grape, the fruit of the vine;
   which is also the opinion of the Jews in Zohar [254] who think that it
   is particularly the black grape: though others have thought it to be
   the apple, as the author of the old Nizzachon [255] which was either
   his own and the opinion of some other Jews, or else he took it from the
   common notion of Christians. But whether it was the apple-tree or no,
   which was so pleasant and desirable to the eyes of the woman, yet it is
   certain that this is very pleasant and delightful to the sight, when
   laden with fruit. Christ as mediator is a beautiful sight to believers,
   as he stands in all his endearing characters and relations; as he may
   be viewed undertaking their cause, assuming their nature, suffering,
   bleeding, and dying in their stead, rising again for their
   justification, ascending into heavens and entering there with their
   names and persons upon his hearts and there ever living to make
   intercession for them: Christ, as possessed of all the blessings of the
   everlasting covenant, being the surety, mediator, and messenger of it.,
   is exceeding delightful to the eye of faith; "his glory is as the glory
   of the only begotten of the Fathers" when he appears to souls full of
   grace and truth. (3.) The fruit which grows upon the apple-tree, as it
   is of various sorts, and of a beautiful aspect to the eye, so it is of
   a cooling and comforting nature. Christ has cooled, turned away, and
   appeased the fierceness of his father's fiery wrath, by his death and
   blood; and does by his mighty grace sweetly cool and refresh the heart
   of a poor sinner, inflamed by a fiery law, and commands serenity and
   peace in its conscience, filled with wrath and terror; and when his
   people are ready to faint and sink, he comforts them with his apples,
   the sweet discoveries of his love and grace, of which the church having
   had some experience, and desiring some renewed instances thereof, says,
   in verse 5 "comfort me with apples;" where I shall more largely take
   notice of this, as well as of their pleasant and delightful smell. (4.)
   The apple-tree has been accounted an hieroglyphic of love; [256] under
   it lovers used to meet, with the fruit thereof they entertained each
   other, under its delightful shade they sat; to which perhaps an
   allusion is not only made in this verse, but also in chapter 8:5. "I
   raised thee up under the apple-tree." Christ and his church are
   throughout this song introduced as lovers, and the subject of their
   whole conversation is love: He who if the apple-tree is the church's
   beloved, whom she loves and prefers before all others; it is his love
   her soul is ravished with; his fruit she feeds upon; his shade that she
   with so much content and pleasure sits under, where she is delighted
   with his love and grace, and sensibly feels her soul all enamored with
   him, Some other things might have been taken notice of, particularly
   the fruit and shadow of this tree, which are both mentioned in the
   text; but these will be considered under another head.

   Now Christ, whom the church here compares to an apple-tree, is by her
   preferred to all others; and she signifies, that as much as the
   apple-tree excels the wild and unfruitful trees of the wood, so much
   does Christ excel all the sons: by whom may be meant either the angels,
   so the Targum, who are by creation the sons of God; but not in so high
   and eminent a sense as Christ is: he has a more excellent name and
   nature than they; as God, he is their Lord and Creator, and the object
   of their highest worship and adoration; and as Mediator, they are
   obliged unto him, being upheld and secured by his grace in that state
   wherein they are; and though in his human nature he was made a little
   lower than they, yet now an the very same nature he is exalted above
   them; for "to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit at my
   right-hand." Or else by them may be meant the saints, who are the sons
   of God by adopting grace: Christ, the eternal son of God has the
   preeminence in, and over these; he is their Creator and Redeemer, their
   lord and king, their head and husband, their everlasting father and
   glorious mediator, to whom they are infinitely obliged for all the
   needful supplies of grace here, and for all the glory they expect here
   after. Or else by them may be meant the men of the world, the sons of
   Adam; and these Christ infinitely excels, as much as the apple-tree
   does the trees of the wood; for he is "fairer than the children of
   men;" there is none like him in all the armies of heaven, nor any to be
   compared with him among all the inhabitants of the earth; if both
   worlds were to be searched with the utmost scrutiny, not one single
   individual person could be found comparable to him: and perhaps,
   particularly by these may be meant the great princes and monarchs of
   the world, who are sometimes in scripture compared to large and lofty
   trees (see Ezek. 31:3, 5, 6, 8; Dan. 4:20-22). But Christ is far
   preferable to these in beauty, glory and majesty; he is "higher than
   the kings of the earth, they receive their crowns and kingdoms from
   him;" they are at his command, and under his dominion; he sets them up,
   and puts them down at pleasure; these must all submit to his awful
   judgment, even as the poorest peasant; and will be equally as fearful
   of "the great day of his wrath," which when come, they will call to the
   rocks and mountains to fall on them, and hide them from the face of
   this omnipotent Judge. Moreover, with respect to the saints, the fruits
   of Christ's grace are to them far preferable to the kingdoms, crowns,
   and scepters of the greatest monarchs, nay, reproach, for Christ's
   sake, is more highly esteemed of by them, and accounted greater riches
   than all the treasures of this world. Though it seems as well to be
   understood in general of all wicked, Christless, and unconverted
   sinners, who are like to the trees of the wood, wild, barren, and
   unfruitful; and what fruit they do bring forth, is sour, wild, and
   unprofitable; and though like the trees of the wood, they may run up a
   great height, yet they shall be cut down and thrown into everlasting
   burnings: for, "the ax is laid to the root of the trees; therefore
   every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast
   into the fire," (Matthew 3:10). Thus the church, by this comparison,
   sets forth the excellency and preferableness of Christ to all others.
   But,

   II.She instances in two excellent properties of this apple-tree, of
   which she had had some comfortable experience. First, The shade of it
   was delightful to her; "I sat down under his shadow with great
   delight." Secondly, The fruit of it was sweet unto her; "his fruit was
   sweet to my taste."

   First, The shade of this apple-tree was very delightful to her; "I sat
   down under his shadow with great delight:" in which may be inquired,
   1st, What is meant by the shadow under which she sat. 2dly, What her
   sitting there intends or supposes. 3dly, What she desired to sit there
   for. 4thly, From whence that pleasure and delight arose, which she was
   filled with.

   1st, It will be proper to inquire what is meant by the shadow of
   Christ, under which she sat. Some [257] have thought that the
   ceremonial law, with its festivals, is here intended, which was a
   shadow of good things to come, of which Christ was the sum and
   substance; under this shadow the Old Testament saints sat during the
   legal dispensation:, where their souls were much delighted and sweetly
   refreshed by viewing Christ, represented in the types and sacrifices of
   that law. The Targum understands it of the shadow of God's Shekinah, or
   divine majesty, under which the congregation of Israel desired to sit,
   when God gave the law on mount Sinai: but that dispensation was not so
   desirable; the law which was then given, was a fiery one; and the words
   which were then spoke were such, that they that heard them, intreated
   that they should not be spoken to them any more: therefore it may be
   better understood of the gospel and the ordinances of it, than either
   of the moral or ceremonial law; under this refreshing shadow saints
   delight to sit; here they enjoy sweet communion and fellowship with
   Christ; the sound of the gospel is joyful to them; the truths and
   doctrines of it are nourishing; the ordinances of it are comfortable
   and delightful; these tabernacles are amiable and lovely; and all
   wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness; and therefore it is no wonder
   that souls desire to sit under this shadow, and when they do, it is
   with delight.

   Moreover, some [258] think that an allusion is here made to the nuptial
   ceremony of spreading the skirt; used by the Jews at the time of
   marriage; of which, see Ruth 3:9 and to which an allusion is made in
   Ezekiel 16:8 or to that veil; which being borne up with four rods or
   staves, was carried over the heads of the new-married couple, at the
   time that the bridegroom brought home the bride into his own house,
   where the whole solemnity was finished; this nuptial ceremony perhaps
   may give the best light to Luke 1:35 "the Holy" Ghost shall come upon
   thee, and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee:" so that this
   phrase of sitting under Christ's shadow, may be expressive of the
   church's being married to Christ, and of that delightful communion
   which she enjoys with him as her husband, when brought home to his own
   house; of which we have an account an the next verse, where she is
   entertained after a noble manner; and has as much of his love
   manifested to her, as she is capable of bearing, nay so much, that she
   is overcome with it. But! rather think that the metaphor is continued
   from the former part of the verse; and that the allusion is made to the
   shadow of an apple-tree, such an one as Christ was; whose shadow arises
   from his person, blood and righteousness; which shadow is, 1. A
   protecting one from heat; such as Jonah's gourd was to him, or as the
   pillar of cloud was to the Israelites in the wilderness, or as a great
   rock to a weary traveler in a hot country. Christ and his righteousness
   are a shadow, which protect souls from the heat of his Father's wrath;
   he, by making atonement for sin, and satisfaction to divine justice,
   hath delivered his own people from the wrath to come, and will
   eternally screen them from it; for though showers of divine. wrath will
   fall on Christless sinners, yet those that are under this shadow of
   Christ's righteousness, shall not have one drop of it fall on them; for
   being justified by his blood, they shall be saved from wrath through
   him; also it is this, laid hold on by faith, which screens from the
   curses of a fiery law, and from the heat of that wrath which it
   sometimes works in the conscience; which is only rightly removed by the
   sprinklings of that blood which speaks peace and pardon, and by the
   application of that righteousness which justifies from all sin, and
   produces a peace which passeth all understanding: likewise Christ is
   the shadow which protects and shelters from the fiery darts of Satan;
   he is as a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones,
   those fiends of hell, is as a storm against the wall; his blood and
   righteousness keep off Satan's fiery darts, preserve from his
   suggestions, and protect from the violence of his temptations; and the
   soul is still more secured by the prevalent mediation, and intercession
   of Christ in heaven, which is founded upon his blood and righteousness;
   so that what faith makes use of on earth to oppose to Satan's
   temptations, Christ does in heaven to secure his people from his false
   charges and accusations: to this might also be added, that he is the
   shadow which protects from the heat of persecution, under which he
   causes his flock to rest at noon; when this sun smites them with the
   greatest violence, he is then their shade on their right hand, so that
   the sun shall not smite them by day; and this is their comfort and
   support under all their fiery trials, that they have such a shadow to
   have recourse to. 2. It is also a refreshing one; for if it is a shadow
   from the heat of God's wrath, the terrors of the law, the temptations
   of Satan, and the persecutions of the world, it must needs be so; what
   can be more refreshing to a weary traveler, that is almost scorched,
   and ready to faint with heat, than a cooling and delightful shade? So
   refreshing is Christ to poor sinners, who is as "the shadow of a great
   rock in a weary land;" nay, is a large spreading apple-tree, that at
   once furnishes them with an agreeable shelter and suitable provisions.
   3. It is a fructifying one; the shadows of some trees, as Pliny [259]
   informs us, are very hurtful and noxious to some plants that grow under
   them, and others are very nourishing and fructifying: Christ's shadow
   is such an one; for "they that dwell under his shadow shall return;
   they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine; the scent thereof
   shall be as the wine of Lebanon," Hosea 14:8 and indeed all the
   fruitfulness of those who are the Lord's planting comes from Christ;
   for, unless they abide in and under him, they can bring forth no fruit.
   The shadows of some trees are injurious to men that lie under them;
   [260] not so Christ's shadow; but there are others [261] very
   delightful and wholesome, to which he may be compared.

   2dly, It may also be inquired what her sitting under this shadow is
   expressive of, or does suppose. And, 1. It shews the sense she had of
   herself, and present condition, and the need she stood in of Christ as
   a shadow; she was not only scorched with the sun of persecution, with
   afflictions, temptations, etc. but she was likewise sensible thereof,
   and therefore betook herself to a proper shade. 2. It manifestly
   appears from her sitting under this shadow, that she looked upon Christ
   to be a suitable one for her in such cases; and that as the idolaters
   in Hosea 4:13. sacrificed on mountains, and burnt incense under oaks,
   poplars and elms, "because the shadow thereof was good;" so the church
   here sat under this shadow of Christ's, because she looked upon it to
   be a good one, and preferable to all others. 3. It is expressive of her
   faith and confidence in Christ: the vain confidence of the Israelites
   in an arm of flesh, is called their "trust in the shadow of Egypt,"
   Isaiah 30:2, 3. and the holy confidence and faith of God's children in
   him, is frequently called a "trusting in the shadow of his wings;" (see
   Ps. 36:7, 57:1) which seems to be the same with sitting under it here:
   the church did not sit idle under Christ, but her faith was in exercise
   upon him; and she was rejoicing alone in him, having "no confidence in
   the flesh." 4. It seems to intimate that security, peace, quietness,
   and satisfaction of soul, she enjoyed; here she sat as under her own
   vine and fig-tree, and none to make her afraid; where, being safe and
   secure from all her enemies, she solaced herself under this delightful
   shade, enjoying much peace of conscience, and satisfaction of mind; for
   she did not sit here with any manner of uneasiness, but with the utmost
   delight and pleasure. 5. It denotes her continuance here; faith takes
   up its dwelling in Christ; it will not move from hence, and is desirous
   of always enjoying sensible communion with him; "he that dwelleth in
   the secret of the most high, shall abide under the shadow of the
   Almighty," (Ps. 91:1). But,

   3dly, What was it she desired to sit here for? For thus may the words
   be rendered, "I desired, and I sat down"; [262] that is, I desired to
   sit down, and I did sit down, I had what I wished for; and what was
   that? no doubt, protection from heat, rest and refreshment for her
   weary and fainting soul; that she might be comforted with those apples
   which grew on this tree, and be revived by tasting of and feeding upon
   the sweet fruit thereof, as well as be comforted with its delightful
   shade.

   4thly, She sat here with delight; and indeed it could not be otherwise
   when its shade was so agreeable, and the fruit so sweet: this pleasure
   and delight of hers arose from the enjoyment of Christ's presence, "in
   whose presence is fullness of joy, and at whose tight-hand are
   pleasures for evermore;" from the discoveries of his love to her soul,
   which is better than life, and all the comforts of it; and were had in
   the exercise of faith upon him, in the actings of which grace the soul
   is filled with "joy unspeakable and full of glory."

   Secondly, The fruit of this apple-tree was sweet unto her taste: by
   this fruit are either meant the fruit of his doings, what his hands
   have wrought out, and his blood has procured for sinners, even all the
   blessings of grace, such as peace and reconciliation, justification,
   sanctification, pardon of sin, adoption, nearness of access to God,
   etc. or else, the fruit of his lips; such as his word and gospel,
   preached by himself, which is sweet to a believer's taste, and is
   preferred to his necessary food; his promises, which are exceeding
   great and precious, and are highly valued by believers, for his mouth
   is most sweet, from whence they proceed; and his ordinances and corn,
   mands, in which they enjoy sweet communion with him, and have the
   discoveries of his love to their souls; and therefore "are more to be
   desired than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than the
   honey or the honey-comb."

   These are called his fruits; they are his in a covenant-way; all the
   blessings of grace, which make up the everlasting covenant, are in
   Christ's hands, and at his dispose, being placed there for that purpose
   by God the Father; and they are also his, being procured by him; for
   though they are all the gifts of free grace, yet are they all obtained
   by Christ, and come to us through his blood: likewise they may be said
   to be his, because in his possession; every grace in its fullness is in
   him, he is full of grace and truth, and is communicated to us from him,
   for from him all our fruit is found; remission of sin, justifying
   righteousness, adopting grace, etc. come to us through and by him; and
   we are indulged with the gospel-promises and ordinances, as instances
   of his grace to us.

   Now these are all sweet to the taste of a believer, though not to a
   natural man who hath a vitiated taste, and calls evil good, and good
   evil; puts bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter; he savors the things
   of the flesh; sin is his food, from whence he receives an imaginary
   pleasure; and therefore disrelishes all spiritual things, looks upon
   them as poor and insipid, and finds no more taste in them than in the
   white of an egg; which arises from the predominancy of sin, that
   hinders from tasting any sweetness in divine things, and will do so
   whilst their taste remains in them; and their scent is not changed: but
   as for a spiritual man he savors the things of the Spirit, and
   disrelishes others; sin is rendered odious, bitter, and unpleasant to
   him; it is in some measure expelled, so that he can taste that the Lord
   is gracious; and therefore every thing he says or does is sweet unto
   him; for as his taste can discern perverse things, so it can relish
   spiritual ones; such as the fruit before-mentioned is, which grows upon
   and drops from the apple-tree, Christ Jesus: this delightful shade and
   excellent fruit, which believers find in Christ, render him very
   acceptable to them, and preferable to all others. Now when souls at any
   time have some experience of Christ's love and grace, in such a way and
   manner, it is very proper to speak of it, for the glory of Christ, and
   the encouragement of other souls, as the church does here; which she
   also continues to do in the following verse, where she meets with a
   larger display of it.

Chapter 2 Verse 4

   He brought me to the banqueting-house, and his banner over me was love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church here goes on to give an account of some larger
   experiences of Christ's love, which she had met with from him; for she
   is not only indulged with his shadow, and refreshed with his fruit, as
   in the former verse, but is also brought into his banqueting-house,
   where she is entertained by him, of which she gives an account in this:
   where may be observed,

   I.What is meant by the banqueting-house.

   II.What by being brought into it.

   III.The manner in which she was brought; "his banner over me was love."

   I.I shall inquire what is meant by the "banqueting-house, into which
   the church was brought; it is in the Hebrew text, a house of wine;
   [263] by which may be meant, either the wine-cellar, [264] the place
   where wine is kept under ground; or else the place [265] where wine is
   poured out, and where it is drank, according to R. Aben Ezra; and so
   may very well be rendered a banqueting-house. Thus we read of a banquet
   of wine, which Esther invited king Ahasuerus and Haman to; and wine
   being much used at feasts, may be put synechdochically, for all the
   other accommodations thereof; by which we may understand either,

   1st, The covenant of grace; this is built for a banqueting house for
   souls; it is a superstructure of grace and mercy, whose foundation is
   the person of Christ; it is well stored with all needful provisions for
   a nobler entertainment; it is "ordered in all things, and sure;" it is
   full of Christ, his love and grace; it is well stored with spiritual
   blessings, and precious promises, which will serve as an everlasting
   banquet for those who are interested in it. Or else,

   2dly, The Sacred Scripture, which is a true banqueting house; here is a
   variety of food, and plenty of it; here is milk for babes, and meat for
   strong men; which is exceeding pleasant and delicious, sweeter to the
   taste than the honey or the honey-comb; revives and refreshes those who
   participate thereof, and is also exceeding wholesome to the souls of
   men: though there are vast numbers daily feasted here, yet there is no
   want; it abounds with the bread of gospel-truths, with the wine of
   gospel-promises, and is full of Christ, the hidden manna, who is also
   the bread of life; he is the alpha and omega of the Scriptures, the sum
   and substance of them, on whom faith. lives, and by whom, from time to
   time, it is sweetly refreshed. Or else,

   3dly, The church is this banqueting house. The Targum refers it to the
   house of the school, where the Israelites learnt; the law at mount
   Sinai from the mouth of Moses; R. Alshech understands by it Sinai
   itself, and so it is interpreted in Yalkut; R. Sol. Jarchi thinks the
   tabernacle of the congregation is intended where the senses and
   explanations of the law were given: but it may much better be
   understood of the church of Christ, which is a house built by wisdom,
   and furnished with all the necessary provisions of grace; here is "a
   feast of fat things prepared of wines on the lees well refined." Christ
   is the master and provider of the feast, and he himself is the chief
   entertainment; his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed;
   to all which he gives his people an hearty welcome; meets them himself
   at his well furnished table, and feasts with them; gives them spiritual
   appetites, and blesses all the provisions of his grace to them: hence
   those are the blessed persons who have admittance into, and a
   dwelling-place in this house, for these shall be continually "satisfied
   with the goodness and fatness thereof;" hence it is that souls are so
   desirous of being here, and are so well pleased with their habitation,
   because it is a banqueting-house unto them; and no wonder then is it,
   that those who are "planted in the house of the Lord, flourish in the
   courts of our God."

   II.What it is to be "brought into [266] this banqueting-house;" which
   may be considered according to the several senses before given. And,

   1st, Seeing by the banqueting-house may be meant the covenant of grace,
   it may be proper to inquire, What it is to be brought into that, and by
   what means? And now here observe, that water-baptism, and a submission
   to it under the New-Testament, give a person no right unto, nor
   interest him in the covenant of grace, even as circumcision did not,
   nor could under the Old; instances of both might be given of persons,
   where there is no reason to believe they have any share or lot in this
   matter: neither does church-fellowship bring a person into it, nor a
   mere submission to any or all the ordinances of the gospel, for "they
   are not all Israel which are of Israel:" nor are they all instances of
   covenant-grace, who are church-members; for there are tares as well as
   wheat grow in Christ's field below; and goats as well as sheep are
   folded in his fold on earth, the church; there are foolish as well as
   wise virgins, and there are "sinners in Zion," as well as the "living
   in Jerusalem" neither are faith and repentance terms and conditions of
   a man's entering into this covenant; for they are some of the blessings
   of grace contained in it; they do not bring a person into it, but are
   evidences of his being there before; but what brings a person into it,
   is an act of sovereign and unchangeable grace before all time; all,
   interested in the everlasting covenant, before the world began, did by
   electing grace "pass under the rod of him that telleth them;" for when
   God made a covenant of grace with his Son on the account of these
   chosen ones, he brought them all into the bond of it, and put all grace
   and blessings into the hands of his Son for them. Now the Spirit of God
   in time does in conversion take and apply this covenant grace to those
   persons, for the quickening, pardoning, justifying and sanctifying
   them; he shews them the covenant, and their interest in it, and enables
   them to lay hold upon it; and every time he does do so, he may be said
   to bring a soul into the covenant, as an effect and fruit of that
   original, ancient act, made before the world began; which is what the
   church might experience here, to wit, a fresh manifestation of her
   covenant-interest; for "the secret of the Lord is with them that fear
   him, and he will shew them his covenant:" Christ led her into his
   banqueting-house, and there feasted her with his royal dainties; for to
   bring, is to lead one to an entertainment. [267]

   2dly, If we understand the scripture by the banqueting-house; then to
   be brought into it, is to have the Understanding opened, so as to
   behold wondrous things out of it; the heart affected with the glorious
   truths thereof, so as to taste the sweetness of the "sincere milk of
   the word;" and distinguish the doctrines of the gospel from those which
   are not so, and be capable of appropriating the promises of it to the
   comfort and satisfaction of our souls; and when we are enabled thus to
   do: we shall find the scripture to be a delightful banqueting-house
   indeed! Now all this Christ does by his Spirit; who is the Spirit of
   truth, who guides and leads his people into all truth. But,

   3dly, If by the banqueting-house we understand the church of Christ;
   then to be brought Unto it, is to be made a partaker of all the
   privileges of it, as those who are no more strangers and foreigners,
   but fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of God. Christ
   first calls men by his grace, then by his ministers invites them to
   come in, that this house may be filled; and by his Spirit powerfully
   works upon their souls; sweetly inclining them not only to give up
   themselves to him, but likewise to one another by. The will of God; he,
   as an instance of his distinguishing grace, takes one of a city, and
   two of a family, and brings them to Zion, where he invests them with
   all the privileges and immunities thereof; here he grants them his
   gracious presence, sheds abroad his love in their hearts, and often
   entertains them with a delightful banquet. Now Christ's thus bringing
   his church into his banqueting-house, shews, 1. Inability on her part;
   we cannot bring ourselves into the covenant of grace, nor can we take
   Views of our interest in it at pleasure; but he who of his own grace
   placed us there, must shew it us: nor can we of ourselves know the
   depths and mysteries of the sacred writings; they will remain a sealed
   book to us, unless the Spirit of Christ open the book, and our
   understandings to look into it: nor will his church, with all the
   ordinances of it, be a banqueting-house unto us, unless he himself be
   present with us. 2. Wonderful grace and condescension on his side; that
   he, Who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, should take one thus
   mean into his own apartments, and there entertain her with the best his
   house could afford. But this will still appear more manifestly, if we
   consider,

   III.The manner in which she was brought; "his banner over me was love."
   It was in a very stately and majestic manner, as well as a loving one,
   that she was brought; and for the illustration of this, it will be
   proper to consider the use of banners, and how they may be applied
   here. And,

   1st, The use of banners, standards, or ensigns, is to gather and keep
   persons together: thus Christ himself was lift up on the cross, and is
   now lift up in the gospel, as an ensign to gather souls unto him; and
   so his love, being displayed in the preaching of the gospel, has a
   power and efficacy in it to draw souls after him; for, as a fruit and
   effect of everlasting love, "with loving kindness" he draws them: and
   in the same way and manner Christ here drew the church unto himself,
   and held her fast; and constrained her to keep close to him, and follow
   hard after him (see 2 Cor. 5:14).

   2dly, A banner displayed, or a standard set up, is an indication of
   war; it is to prepare for it, and to animate to it [268] see Jeremiah
   51:12, 27. This may serve to inform us, that the church of Christ here
   on earth is militant, and therefore in chapter 6:4 is represented as
   formidable and terrible as an army with banners: she has many enemies
   to engage with, as sin, Satan, and the world, and yet has the greatest
   encouragement to fight, for she is bannered under the Lord of hosts;
   Christ is commander in chief; he is given to be a leader and commander
   of the people, and is every way fit for it; he has courage enough to
   appear at the head of his armies, and conduct enough to lead them on,
   and bring them off at pleasure: those that are under him are well
   provided for; their bread is given them in due season, and their water
   is sure; they are furnished with the panoplia, or whole armor of God;
   they may be assured of a crown and kingdom as soon as the battle is
   over, and even of victory beforehand, for they are more than conquerors
   through him that hath loved them; likewise the motto, which is written
   upon the banner, under which they are, is love: and if all this will
   not encourage them to fight, what will?

   3dly, A banner displayed is also a sign of victory; sometimes when a
   town, city, or castle, is taken, the flag is hung out as an indication
   of it (see Jer. 1:2). Christ has got the victory over all his and our
   enemies; he has conquered sin, Satan, and the world; and given his
   church and people a share in all his conquests; and, as an evidence of
   it, has set up his banner over them. Or this may principally intend the
   conquest, which he, by love, had got over her heart; she surrendered
   herself into the victor's hands; and now, as an instance of his mighty
   grace, he introduces her into his own house, under the banner of love,
   by which she was conquered.

   4thly, A banner is for protection and defense; hence Moses built an
   altar, and called it Jehovah nissi, that is, the Lord is my banner;
   because the Lord had been on the side of him and the people of Israel,
   and defended them from the Amalekites. The church was now enjoying
   sweet communion with Christ in his banqueting-house; and that she might
   be safe and secure from her enemies, and abide there during his
   pleasure, without any molestation or disturbance, he sets up his banner
   over her: thus, "when the enemy comes in like a flood," to disturb our
   peace, joy and comfort, "the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard
   against him," (Isa. 59:19).

   5thy, It is to direct soldiers where to stand, when to march, and whom
   to follow; see Numbers 1:52 and Numbers 2:2 which may teach us, who are
   enlisted in Christ's service, not to fly from our colors, but adhere
   closely to Christ and his gospel, his cause and interest, his church
   and people, and to follow him, the standard-bearer, wherever he goes;
   and nothing can more strongly engage us to do so than love", which is
   the motto of his banner; this first drew us to him, this animates us in
   his service? and keeps us close to his person and interest. 6thly, It
   is to distinguish one band from another (see Num. 2:2). As one band has
   one motto upon its banner or ensign, by which it is distinguished from
   another; so the" motto on Christ's banner is love, by which his band or
   company is distinguished from all others: it is this which has made
   them to differ from others; has distinguished them in electing,
   redeeming, and calling grace; and will keep them a distinct and
   peculiar people to all eternity: it is not any works which they have
   done, but Christ's boundless love and grace alone, that make the
   difference between them and others. The allusion may be to the names of
   generals being inscribed on the banners of their armies; so Vespasian's
   name was inscribed on the banners throughout his armies. [269]

Chapter 2 Verse 5

   Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples, for I am sick of love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church being brought into Christ's banqueting-house, or
   house of wine, and having there such large discoveries of his love, she
   falls into a deliquium or fainting fit, not being able to bear up under
   the present enjoyment; and therefore calls to her friends and
   acquaintance that were about her, to give her their assistance in her
   present circumstances. In these words may be considered,

   I.The church's case and condition in which she was; "sick of love."

   II.What relief she asks for. 1st, To be "stayed with flagons," 2dly, To
   be "comforted with apples."

   III.Who the persons are to whom she makes application.

   I.We have in these words the present case and condition in which the
   church was; she was sick of love: this was a sickness of the soul, and
   not of the body; though the one has oftentimes an influence upon the
   other; for as there are various bodily sicknesses and diseases, so
   there are various spiritual ones. 1. There is the sickness of sin,
   which, if mighty grace prevent not, is a sickness unto death; it is in
   its own nature mortal, and can only be cured by Christ, the great
   physician, who heals diseases by forgiving iniquity: this is what is
   natural and hereditary to us; we bring it into the world with us; for
   we are all "shapen in iniquity, and in sin did our mothers conceive us:
   it is an epidemical distemper, which has infected all human nature; all
   are diseased with it, though all are not sensible of it; and it has
   overspread all the powers and faculties of the souls of men, as well as
   all the members of the body; so that there is no part nor place
   exempted from it; for the whole head is sick, and the whole heart
   faint: but this is not the sickness intended here. 2. There is a
   sickness which souls are incident to, that arises from a sense of sin,
   want of the fresh manifestations of pardoning grace, absence of Christ
   Jesus, and a longing after the enjoyment of his person, and the
   discoveries of his love; which though it is not a ,sickness unto death,
   yet it is very painful and afflicting, and can only be cured by the
   enjoyment of the object loved: this discovers itself by a violent
   panting after Christ; a carefulness and activity in the use of means,
   to enjoy his presence and company; a resolution to go through all
   difficulties for the sake of him, and an uneasiness until it receives
   some instances of favor from him: with such souls, Christ is the
   subject of all their discourse; they love to hear his name mentioned,
   especially with commendation, their thoughts are continually upon him,
   and their minds are not easy till they enjoy him; this is the sickness
   which the church was attended with in chapter 5:8. where see more of
   it. 3. There is a sickness which springs from views of Christ's person,
   discoveries of his love, and manifestations of his grace; which
   sometimes over-power the soul, and throw it into the utmost amazement,
   at the consideration of the greatness of Christ's person and grace, and
   its unworthiness to be interested in it; so that it becomes like the
   queen of Sheba; who, when she saw the riches, glory, and wisdom of
   Solomon, it is said of her, that "there was no more spirit in her." And
   this I take to be the case of the church here: it did not arise from
   the want of Christ's presence, or discoveries of his love, but from the
   enjoyment of them both; he had introduced her in a most stately manner
   into his banqueting-house, and gave her a noble entertainment; yea, he
   had plentifully shed abroad his love in her heart, which occasioned her
   to speak after this manner: his person appeared glorious and lovely,
   the entertainment was so large and sumptuous, the motto of love upon
   the banner so bright and glittering, and what she felt in her own soul
   so powerful and inconceivable, that she was quite overcome therewith;
   she was sick through love;" or, as the Septuagint [270] renders it, she
   was "wounded with love:" not that this arises from the nature of love
   itself, which is not painful and grievous, but is owing to our weakness
   and imperfection, who cannot bear large views, nor support up under the
   mighty power of boundless love; we are but poor narrow earthen vessels,
   that can receive and retain but little of it: this was that pressure
   under which she now labored, and for which she seeks relief; which
   brings me,

   II.To consider what it is she calls for to relieve her at this time.
   1st, She desires to be "stayed with flagons." 2. To be "comforted with
   apples."

   1st, Her request is, that some person or other would stay her with
   flagons. The word translated flagons is differently rendered by
   interpreters; some render it flowers, as Jerom and the Vulgate Latin;
   and so she may be considered as having reference to sweet flowers bound
   up in nosegays, the odor of which is very refreshing and reviving; or,
   "make me to lie down in flowers," so Symmachus; according to Plato
   [271] love delights to be in odoriferous places; where there are
   sweet-smelling flowers, there is its habitation, and there it abides.
   Now the church being in love, says, stay me, revive, or support me with
   flowers; perhaps chiefly regarding Christ, who is the only strength and
   support of believers, who only can keep them both from failing and
   fainting; for having heard him speak of himself under the names of
   those delightful flowers, the rose and lily, in verse 1. she is
   desirous that she might be stayed by, and supported with them": the
   Septuagint render the words thus, "strengthen me with ointments;" [272]
   by which may be meant the graces of Christ, which are called so in
   chapter 1:3 ointments were used at feasts, and are of a cheering,
   reviving, and strengthening nature; and may very well express the grace
   of Christ, by which souls are cheered, revived, established,
   strengthened and settled: our translators have rendered it flagons, and
   that very well; for according to the best Jewish writers [273] it
   signifies vessels in which either wine or fine flower are put; and
   perhaps may be comprehensive of all the entertainments of a banquet,
   which are proper to satisfy, delight, and exhilarate; and wine being a
   principal one, may chiefly intend flagons of that (see 1 Chron. 16:3;
   Hosea 3:10); flagons are, by a metonymy, put for wine contained in
   them, as the cup is (Luke 22:20), for the church was desirous of those
   that were full and not empty; such as were full of the wine of Christ's
   love, which is as reviving, cheating, and refreshing as the best wine;
   and which greatly strengthens and supports the animal spirits. [274] In
   what sense Christ's love may be compared to wine, and is preferable to
   it, has been shewn on chapter 1:2, and by flagons of it may be meant
   the doctrines of grace, in which Christ's love is displayed; or the
   ordinances of the gospel, by which it is communicated to the saints;
   and may also intimate, that though the love and grace of Christ are
   given forth in measure to them, yet that they are large measures, which
   believers are desirous of receiving; those who have most grace, would
   have still more; and those who have the greatest sense of Christ's
   love, would have a larger experience of it, and are not content without
   it; they are like "the two daughters of the horse-leech, crying, give,
   give:" and it may be also, that the church may have in view the glories
   and joys of another world; where she should have her fill of love,
   drink freely and plentifully of this wine new with Christ in his
   Father's kingdom, and continue in the uninterrupted enjoyment of his
   presence. Now it ought to be observed, that she is desirous of more of
   that which had brought her into this condition: Christ's love had
   wounded her, and that only could heal her; what had brought her into
   this sick and fainting condition, could only bring her out of it; this
   wounds and heals, kills and makes alive, and is the only reviving
   cordial.

   2dly, She desires that she might be "comforted with apples;" as in the
   former request, she had a regard to the banqueting-house, where she now
   was; so in this to the apple-tree, whose delicious fruit she had lately
   tasted, Apples are of a cooling and comforting nature, [275] and are
   good against a syncope and palpitation of the heart, and the smell of
   them is very reviving: Solinus [276] tells us of a certain people who
   eat no food, but odore vivunt pomorum sylvestrium, live by the smell of
   apples that grow in woods; and that when they go long journeys, carry
   them with them, ut olfactu alantur, that by the smell of them they may
   be nourished and sustained. The words may be rendered, "strew me with
   apples"; [277] strew them about me, and strew them under me: the apple
   was an emblem of love, as before observed; to send or throw an apple to
   another, was a sign of love [278] and must be still more so, to strew
   them about in quantities. By these apples may be meant, either the
   blessings of grace procured by the blood of Christ, which remove the
   fierceness of divine wrath, and being powerfully applied by the Spirit
   of God, do abundantly comfort and refresh the soul: or else the
   doctrines of the gospel, when fitly spoken, and fitly applied, are like
   "apples of gold in pictures of silver;" how comfortable and reviving
   are the doctrines of justification, pardon, perseverance! etc. the
   church had found them so by good experience, and therefore desires
   them. The Targum, by flagons, understands the words of the law; and by
   apples, the interpretations of them; which, it says, are sweet to the
   taste as the apples of the garden of Eden: but it is much better to
   understand then, as we have done, of the doctrines of the gospel, which
   have often been experienced to have relieved persons in a fainting
   condition, such as the church was now in; and who knowing the virtue
   and efficacy thereof, calls for them. And,

   III.The persons she makes application to, the word being in the plural
   number, are either the chorus of virgins, or daughters of Jerusalem,
   her dear friends and. acquaintance, to whom she often told her case,
   especially when in distress, and desired their assistance, who seem to
   be near to her, by that solemn adjuration given unto them in verse 7,
   or else, any other Christian friends that might be standing by her; for
   they that fear the Lord, speak often one to another, converse together,
   and comfort each other: or rather the ministers of the gospel, who, by
   preaching the glorious doctrines of it, are instrumental in the hand of
   the Spirit for comforting the distressed, and reviving the fainting
   souls of God's children; the" perhaps she principally intended Christ,
   who we find immediately came to her relief, as appears from the
   following verse,

Chapter 2 Verse 6

   His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are still the words of the church, declaring what experience
   she had of Christ's grace and presence; who immediately upon the notice
   she gave of her distress, came to her assistance, and with both hands
   supported her in her fainting fit, and brought her out of it. And it
   may be observed, that she called to others for relief in the former
   verse, but it was Christ only that could help her: the flagons and
   apples of a gospel-ministry and gospel-ordinances will not be effectual
   to comfort and sustain the saints in such circumstances, unless Christ
   himself appears in them, and gives a blessing to them; which is what
   the church comfortably experienced here, and therefore speaks of it.
   And,

   I.I shall consider what these words are expressive of.

   II.In what manner they are delivered by her.

   III.To whom they are directed, and for what reasons.

   I.It may be proper to consider what Christ's left hand being under her
   head, and his right hand being said to embrace her, are expressive of.
   And,

   1st, They are expressive of Christ's tender love unto, care of, and
   regard for his church and people; he acts the part of a loving husband,
   who, seeing his bride and spouse ready to, sink and faint, hastens to
   her relief, embraces her in his arms, lays her in his bosom, and
   discovers the strongest and most endeared affection to her: Christ had
   a love for his church from all eternity; his heart was then ravished
   with her, and he took the utmost delight in her, viewing her in all the
   glory his Father meant to bring her to; and therefore requested of his
   Father that she might be his spouse and bride, which was, accordingly
   granted to him; who has ever since remained faithful and loving
   husband, and has given her the fullest and most incontestable proofs of
   it; he has assumed her nature, died in her room and stead, paid all her
   debts, procured every needful blessing for her, has given her right
   unto, and wilt put her into the possession of all that he has; he has
   raised her from the dunghill, the depths of sin and misery, taken oily
   her filthy garments, clothed her in rich attire and royal apparel, and
   set her at his own right hand, in gold of Ophir.

   This love of his remains the same as ever it was, and will do so for
   ever, notwithstanding all her failings and infirmities, her revoltings
   from him, and unkindness to him; for he is Jesus, the same yesterday,
   to-day, and for ever:" though it is true, he does not always manifest
   his love to his people, but sometimes hides his face from them, and
   kindly chides them for their good, and his own glory; yet he cannot
   always withhold his love in the manifestations of it to their souls;
   for though he seems to treat them severely for a while, yet his heart
   is fall of love, pity, and concern; his bowels yearn., and,
   Joseph-like, cannot refrain himself, but must make himself known unto
   his brethren. Christ now has various ways of shewing his love to his
   people, which he does the most suitably and seasonably; when tempted,
   he succours them; when disconsolate, he comforts them; and when
   afflicted, he sympathizes with them; when hungry, he feeds them; when
   naked, he clothes them; when sick, he, as the great physician, heals
   them; when weak, he supports and upholds them with the right hand of
   his righteousness; and when fainting, he cheers and revives them; "he
   giveth power to the faint, and to them who have no might, he increases
   strength;" and this he does by patting his left hand under their head,
   and by embracing them with his right hand; the doing of which is an
   amazing and surprising instance of his grace.

   2dly, These phrases are expressive of that near fellowship and
   communion the church has with Christ; which is variously expressed in
   scripture, as by supping, and walking with him, and leaning on his
   bosom, and here by lying in his arms; which is an indication of very
   near and intimate communion indeed: to be admitted into Christ's
   banqueting-house, and there sit with him at his table, or into his
   privy chambers, and there have converse and communion with him, argue
   great nearness to him, and intimacy with him; but to lie in his arms,
   and have a place in his bosom, what can be nearer? This is the effect
   of that near and indissoluble union souls have with Christ; and what,
   by divine grace, they are called to the enjoyment of; are frequently
   indulged with in their attendance on ordinances; and is that one thing
   they are desirous of, and uneasy without; but which, when obtained,
   gives them the greatest pleasure and highest satisfaction.

   3dly, They are expressive of the enjoyment of blessings from Christ, in
   whose right hand is length of days, and in whose left hand are riches
   and honor. Temporal mercies are Christ's left hand blessings; [279] and
   such a measure of them Christ hands forth to his people in a covenant
   way, as will be needful for them to support them whilst in, and
   comfortably carry them through this wilderness; but Christ's right hand
   blessings are of a spiritual nature, such as a justifying
   righteousness, pardon of sin, peace and reconciliation by his blood,
   and adoption; all which being, by Christ's hand, applied unto his
   saints, cheer, revive, and comfort, when ready to faint; and which
   sustain, uphold, and strengthen them, when ready to sink and die away.

   4thly, They are expressive of the safety and security of the church:
   they must needs be safe from all enemies, and secure from falling, who
   are encircled in the arms of almighty grace, sustained by Christ's left
   hand, and embraced by his right hand, for out of his hands none can
   pluck them: such are, and will be preserved in Christ Jesus, until they
   are safely brought to glory. The Targum and R. Sol. Jarchi expound
   these words of the divine care and protection which the Israelites
   enjoyed in the wilderness; whereby they were not only provided with
   every thing that was useful and necessary, but also defended from every
   thing that was noxious and hurtful.

   II.We may now consider the manner in which these words Were delivered;
   and that they may be considered, either, 1. As a prayer, and be read
   thus, "O that his left hand was under my head, and that his right hand
   would embrace me!" [280] and suppose her still in the same case in
   which she was in the former verse; and seem to intimate, that she had a
   sense of her present state and condition, and a desire to be out of it;
   also, that she was without Christ's presence and communion with him,
   though she had a value for it, and an earnest desire after it, and did
   firmly believe that the enjoyment of it would relieve her. Or, 2. They
   may be considered as spoken in the strength of faith, that it would be
   so; and then the words may be read thus, "his left hand will be under
   my head, and his right hand will embrace me;" [281] and the sense of
   them is, as if she should say, It is true I am now in a very weak,
   feeble, and fainting condition; yet I know I shall not totally sink,
   fail and perish; for he will hold me up and support me, so that I shall
   not be moved: the words seem then to be spoke much in the same manner,
   and to argue the same strength of faith, as those spoke by the church
   in Micah 8:7, 8. Or else, 3. As expressing her present experience that
   it was so; and then the words may be read as they are rendered by our
   translators, "his left hand is under my head," etc. which experience of
   hers she mentions with thankfulness, as she ought to do, to the glory
   of his love and grace, who had so kindly and graciously appeared for
   her in a time of distress; and this she does also in an exulting
   manner, and with a kind of boasting; for though we are not allowed to
   glory in ourselves, nor have any reason to boast of any thing which we
   have done, yet we may glory in Christ, and boast of what he is unto us,
   and has done for us,

   III.The persons to whom she speaks, are either the ministers of the
   gospel, whose assistance she had desired; and having enjoyed the
   comforting and supporting presence of Christ, in the ordinances, and
   under the ministry of the word, she lets them know of it, to encourage
   them in their work, and that they, with her, might bless the Lord for
   it: or else, the daughters of Jerusalem, whom she adjures in the
   following verse; who are persons newly converted, to whom she directs
   her discourse, and gives them this account of her experience, that she
   might allure them to the ordinances, and encourage them to walk in the
   ways of Christ, as well as engage them to join with her in giving
   thanks to him for the reception of so great a mercy; which is very
   agreeable to David's practice (Ps. 34:2, 3), "My soul shall make her
   boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. O
   magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together."

Chapter 2 Verse 7

   I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the
   hinds of the field, that ye stir net up, nor awake my love, till he
   please.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word is some difficulty in these words concerning the person
   speaking, who it is, whether Christ or the church: interpreters are
   divided about it; and there are reasons, not to be despised, given on
   both sides.

   Some think that they are the words of the church, charging the
   daughters of Jerusalem to give no disturbance to Christ, her love, and
   cause him to depart from her, with whom she now was, enjoying sweet
   communion with him; which seems to be the sense of our translators: and
   this sense of the words bids fair, if we consider, 1. The persons to
   whom these words are spoken, "the daughters of Jerusalem;" who were the
   friends of the church, "the virgins, her companions;" who attended and
   waited upon her: Christ is represented in this Song as having his
   friends with him; and the church, as having hers with her, and that in
   allusion to a nuptial entertainment; and therefore it seems most
   reasonable that she should speak to her friends, and not his. 2. In all
   other places, where these words are used, they seem to be the words of
   the church, and not of Christ; see chapter 3:5 and 8:4. 3. The manner
   of the speech shews it, which is not by way of command, which is proper
   to Christ; but by way of adjuration, or giving a charge with an oath,
   which is usual with the church to these persons; for which, beside the
   places before-mentioned, see chap. 5:8. 4. If we also consider the
   matter, it suits well with the church's language; the character, "my
   love," is very applicable to Christ, he being the person whom her soul
   loved; the charge that this love should not be stirred up, but at
   pleasure, agrees with Christ, who is endued with sovereignty, and ought
   to be at his own liberty to stay with, or remove from his people when
   he pleases. 5. It suits with the context and scope of the place: the
   church was now in Christ's arms, where she lay with a great deal of
   pleasure and satisfaction; and being willing to have communion with
   Christ continued, and not interrupted by these persons, she solemnly
   adjures them after this manner; which carefulness and solicitude of
   hers seems also to be the scope and design of those other places:
   chapter 3:5 and 8:4.

   But there are others who think that they are the words of Christ, and
   not without some reason; for, 1. It was the church, Who having solace
   and ease in Christ's arms, was fallen asleep there, and not he in hers;
   and therefore, that she might have no disturbance, he charges the
   daughters of Jerusalem by no means to awake her, till she herself
   thought meet. 2. The church in this Song, when she gives Christ a
   character, which is expressive of her love, does not use this word hbha
   ahabah, love, which is of the feminine gender; but another, ydwd dodi,
   my beloved, or well-beloved, which is of the masculine; but Christ
   makes use of this same word in giving a loving title to his church, as
   in chapter 7:6, and therefore they seem to be the words of Christ,
   speaking concerning and in behalf of his church. 3. Both the word jbha
   ahabah, love, and xpht techphatz, which is in construction with it, and
   is rendered he please, are both of the feminine gender, and so best
   agree with her [282] and may be rendered, "that ye stir not up nor
   awake my love till she please." 4. The following words seem to confirm
   this sense, "the voice of my beloved!" What voice was this she heard?
   Why, the charge he gave to the daughters of Jerusalem not to disturb
   her; which discovered so much love and goodness in him, and her heart
   was so much affected with it, that she breaks out into this pathetic
   exclamation, "the voice of my beloved!"

   And now though the former sense is not to be despised, yet I must
   confess I chiefly incline to the latter, and having thus considered
   whose words they are, I shall now consider the words themselves; in
   which may be observed,

   I.The charge given; not to "stir up nor awake the love till he or she
   please." II.The persons to whom this charge is given; "the daughters of
   Jerusalem."

   III.The manner in which it is delivered; "I charge you by the roes and
   by the hinds of the field.

   I.Here is a solemn charge given not to "stir up nor awake the love," or
   "this love," the well-known love, [283] "till he, or she please;" which
   I have observed may be understood, either as the church's charge to
   these persons not to disturb Christ, in whose company she now was; or
   else, as Christ's charge to them, not to awake the church, who was now
   sleeping in his arms; and both these senses being pressed with such
   reasons as have been before observed, I shall consider the words both
   ways: and then if we consider them as the church's charge, not to
   disturb Christ her love, they will lead us to observe, 1. That Christ
   is the object of the church's love, and of all true believers; there is
   none in heaven or on earth, that has so great a share in their love as
   he has; they love hint with all their hearts and souls, and above all
   things else whatever; and that so sincerely and unfeignedly, that they
   can appeal, with Peter, to the searcher of hearts, and say, "Lord, thou
   knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee;" which arises from
   the discoveries of Christ's love to them, and the views which they have
   of his loveliness; and is still more and more increased, by having
   nearer communion, and more intimacy and acquaintance with him. 2. That
   Christ sleeps and takes his rest among his church and people; this is
   manifest from her carefulness not to have him stirred up and awaked;
   the Lord is sometimes said to sleep, and not to awake, when he does not
   arise to deliver his people from danger, or out of the hands of their
   enemies (see Ps. 35:22, 23, 44:22, 23); and sometimes when he grants
   his presence to them and communion with them, as here: the church is
   Christ's resting-place, where he "rests in his love" towards his
   people, grants his presence to them, converses with them, and "lies all
   night betwixt their breasts." 3. That Christ may be disturbed, and
   raised up from hence by the sins of his people; their vexatious
   contentions one with another, their unfriendly and ungrateful carriage
   to him, often provoke him to remove from them; they grieve his spirit,
   and cause him to hide his face, which is no ways for their honor or
   comfort. 4. That believers should be very careful that they do not
   provoke Christ to depart from them; and therefore should watch against
   the very first motions of sin, and "abstain from all appearance of it;"
   for sinful thoughts, as well as sinful actions, are an abomination to
   him, and lead on to the commission of them; and it is the desire of
   believers, under the influences and by the assistance of the Spirit of
   grace, so to do; which shews that communion with Christ is highly
   valued by them, and what they would not have by any means interrupted.
   5. That communion which souls have with Christ, is entirely at his
   pleasure; they cannot have it, when and as long as they please, but
   when and as long as he pleases; for "when he giveth quietness, who then
   can make trouble? so when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?"
   as Elihu says (Job 34:29). The discoveries of Christ's love and grace
   to his people; the grants of his presence to them, and communion with
   them, as much depend upon his sovereign will and pleasure, as the first
   actings of his grace towards and upon sinners do: he may withdraw from
   his people without any provocation, as he sometimes does; for he is a
   God that "hideth his face from the house of Jacob;" and is not obliged
   to give any reason for it, but his own sovereign will; though he always
   designs their good, and his own glory by it; yet he is oftener caused
   to arise, and remove from them, through their carnality, lukewarmness,
   ingratitude and unbelief.

   But if we consider the words as the charge of Christ to the daughters
   of Jerusalem, not to disturb the church, then we may observe, 1. That
   the church is Christ's love; she is frequently called so by him in this
   Song, as in chapters 1:9, 15 and 2:10 and in other places: she has the
   greatest share in his affections, as he has in hers, and has given the
   fullest proofs of his love to her; which put it beyond all dispute,
   that she is the object of it, and will always continue so,
   notwithstanding all her failings and infirmities. 2. That the church
   sleeps and takes her rest in Christ's arms; there is a sleepiness or
   drowsiness which attends God's children, that is a sinful one; when
   they fold their own arms together, and do not lie in Christ's; in this
   frame was the church, chapters 3:1 and 5:2, but this here is a rest
   which Christ gives, a sleep which he brings his into, when he puts
   under his everlasting arms, and embraces them in his bosom; for "so he
   giveth his beloved sleep," (Ps. 127:2). 3. That Christ values the
   company and conversation of his children: these are "the excellent in
   the earth, in whom is all his delight;" he loves to see their persons,
   and hear their voice; the actings of their grace upon him are exceeding
   delightful to him, and therefore would not have them be disturbed,
   hence it can never be a work well-pleasing to Christ, for any to sadden
   the hearts, lessen the joys, and weaken the faith of God's children. 4.
   That Christ would not have his church's peace disturbed; though it
   oftentimes is by "quarrelsome and contentious persons," who are always
   uneasy themselves, and endeavor to make others so; by "carnal
   professors, whose lives and conversations are wounding and grieving to
   pious souls;" by "errors and heresies," which, "springing up" in
   churches, trouble some, and defile others; and often by "inward
   corruptions," those domestic enemies, which are of all the worst and
   most afflicting; as well as by Satan, that unwearied enemy, who, though
   he cannot devour, yea will disturb; but whether this be done one way or
   other, it is no ways pleasing and grateful to Christ. 5. Though
   believers, when under the gracious influences of the blessed Spirit,
   are desirous of communion with Christ; and if they might have it as
   long as they please, they would have it always, and say, as the
   disciples did, "Lord, it is good for us to be here;" yet when they
   begin to be sleepy and drowsy, they grow careless and indifferent about
   it; which justly provokes Christ to deprive them of it. So much for the
   charge itself.

   II.The persons to whom this charge is given, are the "daughters of
   Jerusalem;" by whom we are to understand young converts, as has been
   observed in chapter 1:5. Now these are very apt to disturb Christ by
   their impatience; who, like new born babes, are unwilling to wait till
   their food is prepared for them; till Christ's own time is come, when
   he will more fully reveal himself unto them, and give them large
   discoveries of his love: and also by their frowardness who, when their
   food is prepared for them, grow sullen and will not eat it; and, like
   Rachel of old, "refuse to be comforted;" or else, through "the weakness
   of their faith, and living upon their frames," which young converts are
   very apt to do; for no longer than they have the discoveries of
   Christ's love, and sensible communion with him, can they believe their
   interest in him; and therefore, like froward and impatient children, or
   poor weaklings, give him a great deal of disturbance: and so taking
   them as the words of the church, she seems here to act the part of a
   mother; and charges these her children to be still and quiet, and give
   her loving husband no disturbance, whilst she enjoyed his delightful
   company.

   Moreover, these daughters of Jerusalem, or young converts, are very apt
   to give the church disturbance; and therefore Christ may be represented
   as charging them not to do it: this they sometimes do through weakness,
   not being able to bear the doctrines of the gospel; such some of the
   Corinthians were, who were "babes in Christ," and therefore the apostle
   fed them with milk, and not with meat, for they "were not able to bear
   it;" by reason of which, many contentions, divisions and disturbances,
   were raised in that church: as also, sometimes through" ignorance of
   gospel-order," not being so well versed in, and acquainted with the
   rules, laws and ordinances of Christ's house; so that oftentimes, for
   want of knowledge in gospel-discipline, as well as in gospel-doctrine,
   they give disturbance to the church of Christ; all which; Christ
   knowing full well, gives them this solemn charge.

   III.The manner in which this charge is given, which is very" solemn and
   awful; it is with an oath, "I adjure you, or I cause you to swear by
   the roes and by the hinds of the field, that ye give no disturbance to
   my love; creatures which ran in fields, forests and woods, and were
   their native places. [284] The meaning is, not as if either Christ or
   his church swore by those creatures; for swearing by heaven or earth,
   or by any creature in them, is condemned by Christ (Matthew 5:34-37),
   an oath ought not to be taken in trifling cases, nor in any other name
   than in the name of God; which perhaps is the reason why the Targum
   thus paraphrases the words here: "I adjure you, O ye congregation of
   Israel, by the Lord of hosts," or Tzebaoth, which same word is used for
   roes here, and by the strengths or fortresses of the land of Israel,
   etc. And either, 1. The words may be paraphrased thus, I charge you,
   who are among the toes and hinds of the fields, you daughters of
   Jerusalem, who are shepherdesses, and keep your flocks where toes and
   hinds skip and play; or who love to hunt them, and delight in such
   exercises; [285] I charge you, that you give my love no disturbance. Or
   else, 2. Thus, I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, that ye
   remain or abide with the roes and hinds of the field, so Junius; mind
   your own business, keep your flocks, stand without whilst I and my love
   enjoy each others delightful conversation, without any interruption or
   molestation from you. Or, 3. Those creatures, the roes and hinds, it
   may be, are called in as witnesses to this solemn charge, and to be
   produced against them, if ever they should break it; as to which
   sometimes heaven and earth, animate and inanimate creatures, are called
   in scripture (see Deut. 30:19; Josh. 24:27). Or, 4. This adjuration or
   charge is made by all that is dear, the toes and hinds being pleasant
   and lovely creatures, as in Proverbs 5:19 as if he or she should say, I
   charge you, O ye lovely daughters of Jerusalem, by the hinds and roes,
   which for beauty and loveliness are like to you, as R. Aben Ezra
   observes; if, O ye lovely ones, ye have any love for me, I beg, I
   earnestly entreat of you, that you will cause neither me nor my love
   any interruption. Or, 5. It may be considered as a severe threatening
   to those persons, if they should be unmindful of the charge given; and
   it is as if he should say, I swear, that if you stir up, or awake my
   love, that you shall be food as common to all, as the toes and hinds
   are; to which purpose as R. Sol. Jarchi's gloss: and these creatures
   being very swift ones; may note the suddenness and swiftness of those
   judgments which should come upon them in case of disobedience. Or, 6.
   The sense may be this: that as ye would, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
   be cautious how you start those timorous creatures, [286] the roes and
   hinds; so would I have you be as cautious how you stir up and awake my
   love, which is as easily and as quickly done. Or, 7. and lastly, I
   charge you, for the sake of these toes and hinds, the Gentiles and
   nations of the world, that ye do not disturb the peace of my church, by
   fomenting and increasing divisions in it; and so cause my name to be
   dishonored, my ways to be spoken evil of, and me to depart from you;
   but rather keep peace within, and "walk in wisdom towards them that are
   without;" and by so doing, you will gratify me, and allure these
   Gentiles to your society and fellowship; who otherwise, like timorous
   roes and hinds, will be frighted and scared from it.

Chapter 2 Verse 8

   The voice of my beloved! behold!
   he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word there was some difficulty in understanding the former words,
   whose they were, whether Christ's or the church's; yet it is certain
   that these are spoken by the church, who hearing Christ, her beloved,
   give such a solemn charge to the daughters of Jerusalem, not to awake
   her, is so affected with his love to her, and care of her, that she
   could not forbear breaking out into this pathetic exclamation upon it;
   and not only takes notice of this, but also of some other instances of
   his love and regard unto her; or else it may be supposed, that the
   sweet and comfortable communion which she had before enjoyed with
   Christ, mentioned in the preceding verses, had been for some time
   interrupted, he having withdrawn himself and she being fallen into a
   spiritual drowsiness; but he returning again to her, and calling her
   out of this state, as in verse 10, she awakes, and takes notice of the
   several steps and procedures of his grace, and records several
   instances of his love unto her; two of which are mentioned in these
   words.

   I.He calls unto her, and she hears and knows his voice and says, It is
   "the voice of my beloved."

   II.He not only calls, but comes, and she spies him coming; the manner
   of which she describes to be, "leaping upon the mountains, skipping
   upon the hills."

   I.The first thing she remarks is his voice, with which she seems to be
   wonderfully affected "the voice of my beloved!" Some Jewish writers
   [287] interpret this of the voice of the Messiah; by which may be
   meant, the gospel of Christ in which he speaks both to saints and
   sinners; and which has a virtue and efficacy in it to quicken dead
   sinners, and comfort living saints; for though it is powerful, yet
   alluring; though full of majesty, yet soft and charming, and makes
   delightful music in the ears of believers; concerning which may be
   observed,

   1st, That the voice of Christ is known and distinguished by believers
   from the voice of others: the church was capable of doing this, and
   therefore says, "the voice of my beloved!" she could know it to be his
   voice, and distinguish it from another's even though but just raised
   out of her sleep; flay, she could do this when she was as it were
   between sleeping and waking; when indulging herself in drowsiness and
   security, as in Chapter 5:2 and thus Christ says, John 10:4, 5 of all
   his sheep, that they not only heard his voice, but knew it, and
   therefore followed him and not strangers; for, says he, "the voice of
   strangers they know not." Now if any should ask how Christ's voice can
   be known and distinguished from others; I answer, 1. By the majesty of
   it; by this we know the scriptures to be the word of God, there
   appearing such a shine of majesty in them, as does not in any other
   writings; and hereby we know the gospel to be the voice of Christ, and
   can distinguish it from that which is not so: Christ speaks in the
   gospel, "as one having authority, and not as the scribes;" there is a
   vast difference between "the words which man's wisdom teacheth," and
   those "which the Holy Ghost teacheth;" the one are low, mean, dead, and
   lifeless; the other not only come with evidence, and "the demonstration
   of the spirit and of power" to believers, but even fasten convictions
   of the original and authority of them upon the minds of wicked men (see
   1 Cor. 14:24, 25). 2. By the power and efficacy of it: the gospel which
   is Christ's voice comes "not in word only, but also in power, and in
   the Holy Ghost;" and so not only reaches the ear, but also the heart;
   it opens blind eyes, unstops deaf ears, quickens dead sinners, awakes
   sleepy, and comforts distressed saints, and is in fine, "the power of
   God unto salvation, to every one that believes." 3. By the spiritual
   food and divine refreshment it affords to believers; who find Christ's
   word and eat it, and it becomes "the joy and rejoicing" of their
   hearts; that which is not Christ's word and gospel, is like the chaff
   to this wheat; and that which is opposite to those "wholesome words of
   our Lord Jesus;" instead of nourishing and refreshing, as these do,
   "eat as doth a canker." 4. Believers know this voice of Christ, and can
   distinguish it from others, by its bringing them to him, and not
   sending them from him; that voice which sends me to my own
   righteousness, and not to Christ's, for acceptance with God and
   justification before him; which sends me to my tears of repentance, and
   not to Christ's blood, for pardon and cleansing, can never be the voice
   of Christ; that voice which bids me keep off from Christ, till I have
   prepared and qualified myself for him, by my own acts of humiliation
   and obedience, is contrary to that voice of Christ which bids me come
   to him as a poor, vile, filthy, and perishing sinner in myself, without
   him; and venture on him for life and salvation; and therefore that
   cannot be the voice of Christ: thus may it be known from the voice of a
   stranger. 5. Believers have the spirit of Christ, who is "the spirit of
   truth," whose work and office it is to "guide them into all truth," and
   enable them to distinguish truth from error; and this he accordingly
   does, for he "searches the deep things of God," and reveals them to the
   saints, and abides in them as a "spirit of wisdom and revelation; in
   the knowledge of Christ. 6. They know it by the scriptures of truth,
   which they dill-gently search, and by which they examine every
   doctrine; and whatsoever sound or language is disagreeable thereunto,
   they reject, as not being the voice of Christ; "to the law and to the
   testimony" they appeal, and whosoever does not "speak according to this
   word," they judge "it is because there is no light in them," (Isa.
   8:20).

   2dly, It may be observed that this voice of Christ, as it may be known
   and distinguished by believers from the voice of others, so it is
   exceeding pleasant and delightful to them. The church seems to speak of
   it as being so to her; and no wonder at was, for it is, 1. A voice of
   love, grace, and mercy to poor sinners; it is not like the law, a voice
   of terror, wrath, and fury; no, it speaks peace and pardon to
   rebellious creatures, and publishes life and salvation to lost sinners.
   Christ came leaping and skipping like a roe or a young hart; or, as it
   is said of Naphtali, like "a hind let loose, who giveth goodly words;"
   and no wonder then that his voice was so delightful. 2. It was also the
   voice of her beloved one, who dearly loved her, and had given
   incontestable proofs of it, and whom she loved with all her heart and
   soul; and therefore his voice, as well as his countenance and person,
   was sweet unto her; it was the voice of the bridegroom, and therefore
   need not be thought strange that the bride, as well as her friends
   should rejoice at it.

   3dly, We may learn from hence, that Christ's voice may be heard before
   he is seen: the church first heard his voice, and then she saw him come
   leaping and skipping over the mountains and hills; and this indeed is
   one way by which souls are brought to a sight of Christ, viz. by the
   preaching of the gospel; nay, believers, even when they are without
   sights of Christ, and sensible communion with him; yet, in hearing the
   word, can distinguish Christ's voice, and can set to their seals that
   it is his, though perhaps they cannot immediately take in the comfort
   of it.

   4thly, Believers would have others know Christ's voice as well as they:
   the church knew this to be the voice of Christ; but she is not content
   with the knowledge of it herself, and therefore speaks of it for the
   information of the daughters of Jerusalem. But,

   II.She not only heard his voice, but also spied him coming to her,
   though at some distance; and perhaps as soon as ever she had heard his
   voice, or the noise of his feet, as R. Aben Ezra explains it, she lift
   up her eyes, or turned herself, and saw him upon the march towards her.
   Here must be considered, 1st, What is meant by his coming. 2dly, The
   manner of it, "leaping upon the mountains, and skipping upon the
   hills." 3dly, Why she prefixes an ecce, or a behold unto it "behold he
   cometh," etc.

   1st, It will be proper to consider what is here meant by Christ's
   coming; which must be understood, either of his com-tug in the flesh,
   which the church had then a distant sight of and is since accomplished:
   this coming of Christ from heaven, and out of his Father's bosom, into
   this sinful world, was not by a change of place, but by assumption of
   nature; whose great end in it was to save sinners, which is entirely
   answered: now, as this had been long promised, frequently prophesied
   of, and nothing was more earnestly expected, and passionately wished
   and prayed for, so nothing was more delightful to the Old-Testament
   saints, than the near approach of it, nor more welcome than when it was
   accomplished. Or else by his coming here, may be meant his spiritual
   coming; for though he withdraws and absents himself from his people for
   a time, yet he will not leave them altogether, and always comfortless,
   but will come unto them: and the church's spying him as coming,
   supposes that he was at some distance from her, with respect to
   sensible communion or enjoyment of his presence, though not with
   respect, either to union or affection; for in this sense she is always
   near unto him: and also, that he was upon the return to her, whom faith
   spied, though at a distance, which is agreeable enough to the nature of
   it; this filled her soul with joy and pleasure; for even distant sights
   of Christ are pleasant, though his nearer approaches give a greater
   satisfaction: his presence is always welcome to a believer, and there
   is a great deal of reason for it; for he always brings something along
   with him, and never comes empty handed; yea, never visits without
   leaving something behind him.

   2dly, The manner of his coming is expressed by "leaping upon the
   mountains, skipping upon the hills:" the allusion is to the leaping of
   a roe or a young hart, as in the next verse, remarkable for leaping,
   even one just yeaned; [288] so a young hart is described as leaping to
   its dam; [289] the leap of one of these creatures is very
   extraordinary; [290] which, if understood of Christ's coming in the
   flesh, shews, 1. That there were many difficulties in the way, and such
   that were comparable to hills and mountains: the greatness of his
   person was no inconsiderable one; nay, such an one, that it could never
   have been thought that it should have been got over, had not God
   himself declared it should be; and we have undeniable evidence that it
   has been; for God to become man, the Creator a creature, and the Word
   to be made flesh, and dwell among us, is such an amazing stoop of
   deity, and surprising instance of divine condescension, that it is even
   the wonder of men and angels: also the greatness of the work he was to
   do, when come, was no small difficulty; here was a broken law to
   fulfill, angry justice to satisfy, sin to atone for, the wrath of God
   to bear, many enemies to grapple with, and a cursed death to undergo;
   and all this for the vilest of miscreants, the worst of creatures,
   whose characters are sinners, ungodly persons, and such who were
   enemies to him in their minds by wicked works. Yet, 2. These
   difficulties which seem insuperable to us, were easily surmounted by
   him; he leaped and skipped over those mountains and hills, which all
   became a plain before our great Zerubbabel; what appear mountains to
   us, were mole-hills to him: therefore he readily engaged, and
   voluntarily undertook before time to assume human nature, which in time
   he did with the utmost cheerfulness; and shewed his eager desires after
   it. long before his incarnation, in often appearing in art human form;
   and when he was actually become incarnate, how eager was he for the
   accomplishment of the work he came about! how easily did he break
   through all difficulties, discouragements, and impediments, that lay in
   his way! and nothing could stop him till he could say the work was
   finished which he undertook; and thus, with the utmost swiftness and
   celerity, he came "leaping upon the mountains, and skipping upon the
   hills." If we understand it of his spiritual coming, it shews, 1. That
   there are impediments in the way of Christ's visiting his people; such
   as their unbelief carnality and lukewarmness, their want of faith in
   him, and affection to him, their backslidings from him, and ingratitude
   towards him; yet. all these mountains and hills he leaps and skips
   over, resolving that nothing shall separate him and them. 2. That
   Christ's coming to his people in a way of grace, is very conspicuous to
   them; the eye of faith spies him at a distance, as it were, upon the
   mountains: and also, that it is very glorious and beautiful; for if
   "beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth glad
   tidings," much more beautiful must the feet of Christ, or Christ
   himself be, when he comes and grants his gracious presence to his
   people. 3. It denotes the speediness, swiftness, and readiness of
   Christ, to help his people; he makes haste and delays not, and
   therefore is said to leap and skip; his heart is set upon it; and
   nothing shall prevent him, though mountains and hills are between them.

   3dly, She prefixes an ecce, a behold, to this coming of Christ unto
   her; which, if applied to his coming in the flesh, may be considered,
   either, 1. As a note of admiration; as in Isaiah 7:14. "Behold a virgin
   shall conceive and bear a son:" the incarnation of Christ, though it
   was confirmed to the church by promises, types and prophecies, yet was
   so strange and stupendous a thing, that nothing but faith could receive
   it, and that with the most profound admiration. 2. As a note of
   attention or asseveration; and so is used by her to stir up the
   daughters of Jerusalem to an observation of his near approach, and to
   encourage them in their faith and expectation of it, as well as that
   they might participate of her joy in the views thereof (see Zech. 9:9).

   Again, if we understand it of Christ's spiritual coming; this is, (1.).
   Matter of admiration, and therefore may well have an ecce, a behold,
   prefixed to it; we have all, who know any thing of this, reason to say
   with Judas, not Iscariot, in John 14:22 "Lord, how is it that thou wilt
   manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?" (2.) It is also worthy
   of observation. Christ's special grace and favor in this regard ought
   not to be carelessly overlooked; but we should take notice of it with
   thankfulness, and wonder at it ourselves, and remark it to others, that
   they may join with us in magnifying the Lord on such an occasion, as
   the Psalmist did, in Psalm 34:1-3 who, as the church here, was so
   affected with the loving-kindness of the Lord, in this instance of it,
   that he tells it to others for this purpose.

   My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart: behold he standeth
   behind our wall, he looketh forth at the window, shewing himself
   through the lattice.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church continues her discourse concerning Christ, and takes
   notice of the several steps he took in manifesting himself unto her.

   I.She compares him to "a roe or a young hart."

   II.Declares the several gradual discoveries of himself unto her.

   I.She compares him to "a roe, or a young hart;" which seems to be
   occasioned by his swift and speedy approach unto her, mentioned in the
   former verse; for these are creatures remarkable for their swiftness
   [291] (see 2 Sam. 2:18). and may have reference to Christ's celerity in
   his coming in the flesh who, as soon as ever "the fullness of time" was
   come, made no delay, but immediately clothed himself with human nature,
   in order to dispatch, with the utmost speed, the work which he had
   agreed to do; and with no less speed does he haste to the assistance of
   his people, when under trials, desertions, temptations and afflictions,
   and shews himself to be "a very present help in trouble:" likewise his
   second coming to raise the dead, judge the world, reward his saints and
   punish his enemies, will be equally as swift and sudden; for which
   reason it is compared (Matthew 24:29), to "the lightning which cometh
   out of the east," and in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, "shineth
   even unto the west:" but besides the swiftness of these creatures,
   Christ may be compared to them, or be said to be like to them on some
   other accounts; as, 1. For their pleasantness and lovingness; they are
   pleasant and loving creatures, as appears from Proverbs 5:19. Christ is
   pleasant and desirable in his person to his people, being "white and
   ruddy, and the chiefest among ten thousand; he is loving in his
   carriage and deportment to them, and has given the most undeniable
   proofs of the reality, sincerity, strength and immutability of his
   love, in shedding his blood, and by giving his life for them. 2. For
   their choiceness and excellency, as R. Sol. Jarchi observes; young roes
   and harts being the most choice and excellent: Christ is so in his
   nature, person, office, people, and ordinances; he is so in the esteem
   of his Father, and in the esteem of men and angels; for though he is
   disallowed by some, yet he is highly valued by others. 3. For the
   antipathy there is between these creatures and serpents: historians
   [292] report of them, that they search out the lurking-places of
   serpents, and not being able to come at them in their holes, do: by the
   very breath of their nostrils, draw them out from thence [293] and then
   trample upon them, tear them in pieces, and eat them: this may an some
   measure represent that enmity there is between that old serpent Satan,
   and Christ Jesus, the seed of the woman, who was manifested in human
   nature, to break his head, and destroy his works, which he has
   accordingly done. It is also farther reported of the hart, [294] that
   after eating serpents, it grows prodigious thirsty, which occasions
   dreadful cries and lamentations, and violent pantings after the
   water-brooks; to which an allusion is made in Psalm 42:1, and yet
   knowing, by an instinct in nature, that it is dangerous to drink until
   it has digested them, forbears a while: Thus Christ when he destroyed
   that old serpent the Devil, sustained the weight of his Father's wrath,
   which occasioned a bloody sweat in the garden, piteous moans upon the
   cross, a violent consumption of the radical moisture; so that his
   "strength was dried up like a potsherd," and his "tongue cleaved to his
   jaws," with the violent thirst that was upon him; such an one he had,
   as is manifest from those words of his, when suffering upon the cross,
   I thirst. Moreover, it is reported in Lybia, [295] where there is a
   great number of serpents, that when they see a hart lying alone, will,
   in great numbers at once, attack him; some wrapping themselves about
   his feet, others about his horns, his neck and belly, and bite him
   dreadfully; upon which he gets up and runs about, here and there, in
   great distress, but at length throws himself upon his back; some he
   rubs to death, and others he devours, and then hastens to the
   water-brooks to cleanse and refresh himself: thus Christ was beset by
   all the infernal powers, yet spoiled them all, got an entire victory
   over them, and now enjoys the glories of it. These were creatures fit
   for food, and were allowed to be so by the Levitical law; naturalists
   say [296] that by their being hunted, their flesh becomes softer:
   Christ is "the bread of life," and the "hidden manna;" he is very
   agreeable food for souls; his flesh is meat indeed," and his "blood is
   drink indeed;" and by reason of the sufferings which he underwent in
   our nature, is become very suitable food for faith. 4. These creatures
   are long-lived ones: it is reported [297] that Alexander the Great,
   having taken some of them, put golden chains about them, with which
   they were found, covered with fat, a hundred years afterwards, and
   scarce any appearance of old age in them. Christ lives, and will live
   for ever; he died once for the sins of men, but will never die more; "I
   am he," says he, "that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive for
   evermore," (Rev. 1:18) for such reasons as these, and perhaps some
   others, Christ may be said to be "like a roe or a young hart." The
   Septuagint here adds, "upon the mountains of Bethel," which is not in
   the Hebrew text.

   II.She declares the several gradual discoveries of himself unto her. In
   the former verse, she tells us, that she first heard his voice, and
   then saw him come "leaping upon the mountains," and "skipping upon the
   hills;" and here she observes some nearer approaches of him to her.
   1st, She says, that he stood behind their wall. 2dly, Looked forth at
   the windows. 3dly, Shewed himself through the lattice.

   1st, She says, that he stood behind their wall; by which is meant,
   either, 1. The incarnation of Christ, whose glorious Deity was covered
   and hid under the wall of our humanity; [298] which is called our wall,
   because he was made partaker of the same flesh and blood with us. Or,
   2. The walls of our hearts, of which we read (Jer. 4:19), "I am pained
   at my very heart;" in the Hebrew, it is, "I am pained at the walls of
   my heart;" such are our sins and transgressions, [299] which are as so
   many as walls of separation between Christ and us, particularly
   unbelief, lukewarmness, carnal reasonings, etc. behind which Christ
   stands; and which, by the mighty power of his grace and spirit, he
   batters down and demands an entrance. Or else, 3. The ceremonial law,
   which the apostle call (Eph. 2:14), "the middle wall of partition:"
   this separated between Jew and Gentile, and was made up of many hard
   and difficult precepts; behind this wall Christ stood under the Old
   Testament dispensation, and shewed himself to his people in types and
   figures, though but darkly and obscurely in comparison of the gospel
   revelation. Or else, 4. By it may be meant the church's defense and
   protection: the church is a city, and a walled one; God himself is a
   wall of fire round about it; and has also appointed salvation for wails
   and bulwarks; his ministering servants, he has not only set upon Zion's
   walls, but has made them as walls of brass unto them; he has set them
   both for the defense of the church and of the gospel: now Christ's
   standing behind her wall, may shew that he is ready to protect his
   people, redress their grievances, and revenge himself upon their
   enemies. Or rather, 5. In general it shews, that Christ was nearer unto
   her than he had been before; she then saw him, but at some distance,
   upon the hills and mountains afar off; but now he was come nearer, even
   to her very home, and stands behind her wall, being desirous to enter
   in; but still there was some distance of communion, a wall between
   them, and a wall of her own building: it was owing to her own
   infidelity, carnality, and sleepiness, that Christ stood at a distance,
   and drew no nearer than he was; and yet notwithstanding this, he stands
   waiting as it were for invitation to enter in.

   2dly, She takes notice of a farther discovery of himself: he comes from
   behind her wall and looks in at the windows, to see in what posture his
   church was, and how things were managed in his house. The allusion is
   to the quicksighted roe or young hart; which, as it is remarkable for
   its swiftness, as in verse 8, so for the sharpness of its sight; Pliny
   says [300] it is never dim sighted; it has its name dorcas in Greek,
   from its sharp sight. [301] By windows, we are not to understand the
   windows of the heavens, through which the Lord looks down upon his
   people, and beholds them under all their afflictions, and in their
   several cases and circumstances, as some of the Jewish writers [302]
   do; but rather, the ordinances of the gospel, which are that to the
   church, as windows are to a house, they let in light to souls; which
   windows, for the glory and excellency of them, are said (Isa. 54:12),
   to be as agates. Christ looks forth at these; and shews himself in his
   glory and beamy to his saints; even as kings and great men look forth
   at the windows to be seen in their majesty and splendor by their
   people: also in at these windows Christ looks, and takes notice how his
   children behave themselves under the ordinances; with what reverence
   and attention, faith and affection, they hear the word; and in what
   becoming manner they carry themselves at the table of the Lord; and
   there is not the least motion of the heart that escapes his notice.

   3dly, She takes notice of his shewing himself through the lattices;
   which seems to intend a more clear and glorious discovery of himself in
   the means and ordinances of the gospel; though indeed, our clearest
   sights of Christ here, are but as through a glass darkly, through
   windows and lattices, and not face to face, as they will be in another
   world: and it may be observed from hence, that unless Christ shews
   himself unto us, we can get no sight of him; for "when he hideth his
   face, who then can behold him?" as also, that Christ usually discovers
   himself in the use of means through the ordinances; and therefore these
   are to be observed carefully, and attended on constantly. Moreover, a
   behold is prefixed to all these gradual manifestations of himself;
   which shews us, that Christ's discoveries of himself to his people are
   exceeding wonderful and ravishing; a glimpse of him behind the wall, is
   a surprising instance of his grace, much more his looking forth at the
   windows; and his shewing or flourishing [303] himself. In all his
   beauty and glory, through the lattices, as the word signifies; this is
   enough to throw us into the greatest raptures and ecstasies of mind,
   and fill us with a joy unspeakable and full of glory.

Chapter 2 Verse 10

   My beloved spake, and said unto me,
   Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having made so near an approach to his church, as to come to
   her very wall, nay, to look in at the windows, and shew himself to her
   through the lattice, calls aloud to her to arise from her sleep, and
   come away with him; which she distinctly heard and understood, and
   therefore relates the very words he said to her, which she might be
   capable of; for if she could say it was the voice of her beloved, when
   he was a great way of, at a distance from her, upon the hills and
   mountains; she must needs know and understand distinctly what he said
   now, when he was so near her. These then are the words of the church,
   giving an account of what her beloved said to her, when he made her
   this kind and indulgent visit; in which may be considered,

   I.The preface to the following discourse; "my beloved spake, and said
   unto me."

   II.The exhortation which he presses a compliance to; rise up, and come
   way."

   III.Some affectionate titles which he gives her: "my love, my fair
   one."

   I. The preface which she makes to this discourse of Christ to her, of
   which she gives an account in this and the following verses, is, "my
   beloved spake, and said unto me:" in which may be considered, 1. The
   person speaking, "my beloved;" which title has been frequently met with
   and explained, particularly in chapter 1:13. 2. The mode of expression
   in this preface, which in the Hebrew text is thus, "my beloved
   answered, and said unto me;" [304] which mode of speaking is frequently
   made use of by Christ in the New Testament; and perhaps is an Hebraism
   in all those places where it is there used; but here it seems to be
   expressive of an answer to a secret petition of hers. There is
   undoubtedly such a thing as mental, as well as vocal prayer, in which
   the desires of the soul are put up to God; and that under the
   influences of the Spirit, who maketh intercession for the saints, With
   groanings which cannot be uttered: and such mental petitions and
   desires are heard, regarded, and answered by Christ Jesus, who is privy
   to the secret motions of our souls Godward, and understands full well
   the language of a sigh and groan; which shews him to be the omniscient
   God; gives a manifest proof of his deity; as well as evidences his
   tender regard to his people, and his readiness to help them under all
   their distresses. 3. The notice which she takes of it. As Christ is not
   always much, but opens his mouth, and returns suitable answer, gives
   proper directions and instructions, and speaks peace and consolation to
   his people; so they are not always deaf, but have ears to hear, they
   listen to what he says; and as they can distinguish his voice from
   another's, so they regard it above all others: what he speaks unto
   them, is received with much pleasure and delight; his words are not
   harsh and austere, but full of love, grace, pity, and compassion. Now
   it may be observed from hence, that there is such a thing, as souls
   being satisfied when Christ speaks to them, and that it is not n
   delusion: the church knew that it was her beloved that spake, and not
   another; and that he spake to her in particular, "my beloved spake, and
   said unto me:" and so every believer may, in some measure, know when
   Christ speaks unto him, and that it is not a delusion; as when it makes
   us love Christ more, and quickens us to our duty; or when it discovers
   Christ's love to us, and our interest an him; when it excites our
   faith, our hope, and joy, has a tendency to promote holiness of heart
   and life, puts us upon glorifying Christ, and makes us more active and
   vigorous in his service; all which seem to be the effect of Christ's
   speaking to the church here. But,

   II.What Christ says unto her is by way of exhortation which consists of
   two parts, 1st, To rise up. 2dly, To come away.

   1st, He exhorts her to rise up, and that in the most tender and
   affectionate manner, as will be observed hereafter; which supposes,
   either, that she was asleep upon a bed of carnal security, indulging
   herself in ease and sloth; or else, that she was cast down in her soul
   under a sense of sin, and for want of his presence, sitting in
   darkness, without the light of his countenance, bemoaning her sorrowful
   and disconsolate condition: as also, that walking in the path of faith,
   and running in the ways of Christ's commandments, better became her,
   than sitting still and being indolent; and likewise, that to lift up
   the head, and to be of a cheerful spirit, better suited with the spouse
   of Christ, than a sad and dejected countenance; who had no need to sit
   in the dust, and clothe herself with sackcloth and ashes, when she is
   the king's daughter, nay, the queen herself, whose clothing is the gold
   of Ophir: so that neither an indolent and unactive, nor a sorrowful and
   dejected spirit, become the people of God and spouse of Christ.

   2dly, He exhorts her also to come away; from whence? why, from off her
   sluggish bed, or from out of her prison of darkness and unbelief, or
   from the company and conversation of wicked and ungodly men; and, in
   short, from every thing that might bring a dishonor to him, or be
   prejudicial to herself; which shews the great regard that Christ had
   for her. But whether would he have her come? why, to himself, where she
   might have peace and comfort, enjoy sweet communion with him, be out of
   the reach of enemies, and free from danger by them; he would have her
   quit her former companions, her former ease and pleasures, and go with
   him, where she should enjoy ease, pleasure and conversation, superior
   to these; he would have her be up and about her duty, following him,
   the lamb, whithersoever he went: in giving which advice, he sought her
   own good and comfort, as well as his own glory. The Jewish writers
   [305] understand it as God's call to the people of Israel to come out
   of Egypt.

   III.The loving and affectionate titles which he gives her, are, 1. "My
   love," which has been already explained in chapter 1:9. 2. "My fair
   one;" in what sense the church is fair and comely, has been shewn in
   chapter 1:5, the church is Christ's fair one; not upon the account of
   her works of righteousness, as the Targum explains it; but upon the
   account of the imputation of Christ's righteousness, the pardon of her
   sins thro" his blood, and the sanctification of his Spirit. The
   Septuagint add a third character, "my dove;" but this is not in the
   Hebrew text. Now he uses these titles, (1.) To shew her his ardent love
   and tender affections to her; that though she was in a carnal and
   secure frame, and negligent in her duty, yet she was his love and fair
   one still. (2.) To remove all discouragements from her that might arise
   from the consideration of her present state and condition. (3.) To
   prevail upon her arise and go with him; and indeed an exhortation,
   expressed in such moving language, delivered in such an affectionate
   manner, one would think, could not fail of succeeding, especially when
   pressed with a claim of interest in her, my love, and my fair one; as
   also when designed for her own good, for so the words may be read,
   "rise up for thyself, and come away for thyself;" [306] it will turn to
   thy advantage, if thou dost do so; if not, it will be detrimental to
   thee. What other arguments he makes use of to enforce this upon her,
   will be seen in the following verses.

Chapter 2 Verse 11

   For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word here presses upon and encourages his church to rise up from
   her present state of sleep and sloth, and come away with him, where she
   might enjoy peace and pleasure! and this he does by informing her, that
   it was now spring-time; that the winter was past, and the spring was
   come, in which every thing looked gay, pleasant, and delightful; the
   rain was over and gone, which made journeys difficult, and rivers
   unpassable, and in the room of it, fair and sunshine weather; that that
   time of the year was over which was bad to travel in, as Christ says,
   "pray ye that your flight be not in the winter;" and therefore she
   might without fear, and with the utmost safety as well as pleasure,
   venture abroad with him. Winter and rain are very properly put
   together, since rain is frequent in the winter-season; and hence it has
   the name of imbrifer [307] from it. Now by this winter, which is said
   to be past, and the rain that is said to be over and gone, may be
   meant, either,

   First, The state and condition both of the Jews and Gentiles, before
   the coming of Christ in the flesh, when it was a winter, a rainy and
   stormy dispensation with both of them. Winter is used by some writers,
   not for the season of the year, but for a storm and tempest; [308] and
   figuratively, for some calamity, as war, etc. [309] And,

   1st, It may be expressive of the state of the Jews before Christ's
   coming [310] It is true, they were a people peculiarly chosen by God,
   and were indulged by him with special favors above the Gentiles; they
   had the knowledge of the true God, and were instructed in his mind and
   will; for he gave them his law to direct them, and sent his prophets
   time after time to inform, teach, rebuke, warn and admonish them;
   whilst the Gentiles lived without the law, and had only the dim fight
   of nature to guide them: and yet the dispensation which the Jews were
   under, before Christ's coming, when compared with the
   gospel-dispensation, may be said to be a winter, a rainy and stormy
   one; which began when the law was given on mount Sinai, which was
   attended with blackness, darkness, and tempest. These people were all
   along treated by God, as if they had been under a covenant of works;
   for whilst they lived in obedience to the divine will, they enjoyed
   without disturbance their civil and religious privileges; but when they
   broke and transgressed the divine laws, the clouds of God's wrath
   gathered thick and black about them, and stormy judgments descended on
   them, which begat in them a spirit of bondage; so that their services
   which they performed to God, were not attended with that spirit of
   liberty and ingenuity, with that faith and cheerfulness, as now appear
   in the saints in this spring-time of the gospel: it was a time of
   coldness and barrenness, the sun of righteousness not having as yet
   arisen in their horizon, with his warming and fructifying influences as
   he has done since: it was a time of much darkness and obscurity; for
   though there were some discoveries of Christ and his grace to believers
   then, yet these were made through dark shadows, cloudy and smoky
   sacrifices: a little before Christ's coming in the flesh, and appearing
   in his public ministry, there was a violent rain, nay, a flood of
   error, infidelity and profaneness, came pouring in among them; the law
   of God was corrupted with false glosses, his institutions and
   ordinances changed and altered, and his temple profaned; one sort set
   up the traditions of the elders, against the positive commands of God;
   another denied the resurrection of the dead, and a future judgment; and
   both obstinately persisted in their infidelity concerning the Messiah,
   when he appeared among them. This was the face of things when Christ
   was manifested in the flesh; who, by his ministry, checked the
   infidelity and profaneness of the age; and, by his death, put a period
   to the Mosaic dispensation: so that now those cloudy and shadowish
   ceremonies are gone; the night of Jewish darkness is ended, and the old
   covenant is waxen old, and vanished away.

   2dly, It may also point out the state and condition of the Gentiles
   before Christ's coming. The times before the gospel came among them,
   were times of ignorance; they were strangers to the knowledge of the
   true God, to his mind, will, and worship; darkness covered them, yea,
   gross darkness was all, around them; storms of divine wrath hang over
   their heads; they were under the manifest tokens of God's displeasure,
   being given up to judicial blindness and hardness of heart, and were
   shut up in sin and unbelief; their hearts were frozen up; and seemed
   scarce capable of having any impressions made upon them; the Gentile
   world looked like an heath, a desert, or a wilderness, all barren and
   unfruitful, like the earth in winter time; an impetuous rain and flood
   of profaneness, error and seduction, overflowed it: God suffered them
   to walk in their own ways, and to follow the imaginations of their own
   hearts; they were left to worship birds, four-footed beasts, and
   creeping things; to fall down to stocks and stones, and graven images,
   and pray to a god that could not save: but when the gospel was sent
   among them by Christ, the face of the Gentile world was quite altered,
   and appeared like the earth after a winter season, upon the returning
   spring; gospel light diffused itself through all the parts thereof, and
   dispelled the shades of darkness, blindness, ignorance, profaneness,
   and infidelity; gospel grace, with its warming influences, thawed their
   frozen hearts, and left some deep and lasting impressions on them; that
   which looked like a wilderness, is become a fruitful field; and that
   which was as a desert, now appears as the garden of the Lord: such a
   mighty change has the spring-time of the gospel made in the Gentile
   world! Or else,

   Secondly, This winter and rain, which Christ says were past and gone,
   may be understood of the spiritual state of souls; mad that either
   before or after conversion. The state of believers before conversion,
   may be represented by it, which is a time of darkness, deadness,
   coldness, barrenness, and un-fruitfulness, and is only removed by the
   powerful and efficacious grace of Christ; and often after conversion,
   is a winter season with them; they are frequently annoyed with the
   blustering winds and rains of Satan's temptations, which beat upon them
   like a storm against a wall: this enemy of their souls often comes in
   like a flood upon them: and would bear them away, were it not for the
   power and grace of the Spirit of God, which are opposed unto it; they
   are often under the fearful apprehensions of storms of impending wrath,
   for their sins and transgressions against God; they are seldom free
   from sharp crosses and afflictions, and are often under the nipping
   blasts of persecution; which may be compared to the winter season for
   its sharpness and severity, though exceeding wholesome.

   Moreover they are sometimes in a great deal of darkness of soul; the
   clouds interpose between Christ and them, so as they cannot behold him,
   and their interest in him; their hearts are often hard and frozen up,
   so as no impressions are made either by the preaching of the word, or
   by the providences of God; a great deal of coldness .frequently attends
   them; there is a chill upon their love to God, to Christ, to his
   people, ordinances, cause and interest, which is occasioned by the
   prevailings of sin and corruption in them: sometimes they look like
   trees in winter, barren and unfruitful, with no appearance of the fruit
   of grace, nor leaves of profession, but as if they were entirely dead
   and lifeless; and when this is their case, it may be said to be a
   winter-season with them: but though this is sometimes their case, it is
   not always; they have their returning seasons of peace, joy and
   comfort, when it may be said, "the winter is past, and the rain is over
   and gone;" then light breaks in upon their souls, and their hearts are
   melted with a sense of divine love; they become lively in their frames,
   and in the exercise of their grace, and fruitful in every good word and
   work; calmness and serenity of mind, peace of conscience, and joy in
   the Holy Ghost, are the delightful blessings which the soul now enjoys:
   all these, and much more, does the sun of righteousness bring along
   with him, and produce in us, when he arises with healing in his wings,
   and turns a cold and nipping winter into a pleasant and delightful
   spring. But when it is a winter-season with believers, they have little
   or no communion with Christ, which was the church's case here the rains
   that fall, and the floods occasioned thereby, interrupt their
   fellowship; and the clouds of darkness and doubts and fears, which hang
   over their heads, hinder them from beholding; Christ, and their
   interest in him: now this must needs be a very melancholy and
   uncomfortable time unto them; and therefore to hear that the winter is
   past, and the spring is come, that the rain is over and gone, that the
   clouds are dispersed, and the air is clear, bright and serene, must
   needs be good news and glad tidings to them. Moreover, souls, whilst in
   such a state, are usually indolent and inactive; they have neither
   hearts nor hands to work, but both are sealed up; they are neither
   diligent in the way of their duty, nor active in the exercise of grace,
   as the church appears to be here: also they are ready to think that the
   winter is not over when it. is, but fear that there are more storms
   behind; not only of crosses, afflictions, persecutions and temptations;
   but which are worse than all the rest, that there are storms of divine
   wrath and anger behind, which will fall upon them; though these have
   been all borne by Christ, and are effectually and eternally removed by
   him; and believers may be assured of this, whatever their fears are,
   that not a drop of wrath shall fall upon them; for Christ has satisfied
   law and justice, and so hath delivered them from the wrath which is to
   come; and he that has done this, says, the winter is past, and the rain
   is over and gone: this is the voice of the gospel, and a joyful sound
   it is. The Jewish writers [311] interpret this of the bondage of the
   people of Israel in Egypt, and their deliverance out of it; as do stone
   Christian interpreters [312] of the Babylonish captivity, and the Jews
   deliverance from thence; it being a Chaldee word [313] that is here
   used to express the season of the year by: but the senses before given,
   seem to be much preferable to either of them; though it is true, that
   the two former deliverances did produce a spring-time of joy and
   rejoicing after a cold and nipping winter of trouble and sorrow; and
   were indeed wrought in the spring of the year, as was also our
   redemption by Christ Jesus, they were typical of.

Chapter 2 Verse 12

   The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the singing

   of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church goes on to give an account of the pressing instances
   that Christ made unto her, to arise and come away; which he had done in
   the former verse, by assuring her that the winter was past, and
   therefore she need not be afraid of nipping blasts and blustering
   storms, nor of heavy rains, which would make traveling difficult, as
   well as unpleasant; and here he encourages her to arise and come with
   him, from the pleasantness of the spring, of which he gives the
   following account, in this and the next verse, enough to tempt her to a
   compliance; and which is very pleasant and inviting to lovers. [314] In
   this verse he says,

   I.That "the flowers appear on the earth;"

   II.That "the time of the singing of birds was come."

   III.That "the voice of the turtle was heard in their land." All which
   are so many evident demonstrations of the springtime of the year; which
   of all others is the most pleasant.

   I.The first sign of the spring, and which he mentions to prevail upon
   her to quit her present place and posture, and go with him, is, that
   "the flowers appear on the earth:" [315] in the winter-season the earth
   appears barren and unfruitful, being nipped with cold winds, frost and
   rain; but when the sun returns with its warming influences, it quickens
   those herbs and plants which before lay hid, and causes them to spring
   forth and flourish; so that the fields and meadows, as well as gardens,
   are covered with a variety of herbs, plants and beautiful flowers,
   which are very pleasant to the eye, and cause walking in the fields to
   be very delightful. Some Jewish writers, as Jarchi and Alshech,
   interpret them of the two messiahs, the Jews dream of, and vainly
   expect; it is much better to interpret them of the one and only true
   Messiah, who appeared on earth in the spring of the acceptable year of
   the Lord; and who is compared to various flowers in this book,
   particularly to the rose and lily, verse 1. which are both
   spring-flowers: [316] but rather, by these flowers may be meant, either
   "the graces of the spirit" in the saints, which, when it is a
   winter-season with them, lie dormant, and are as it were dead and
   lifeless, and are scarcely discernible either to themselves or others;
   but upon the return of "the sun of righteousness," they revive and shew
   themselves in all their glory, send forth a grateful odor, and give a
   delightful prospect to all beholders; such are those Flowers of faith,
   hope, love, humility, self-denial, patience, long-suffering,
   forbearance with and forgiveness of each other: or else, by "these
   flowers may be meant the saints themselves. The Targum interprets them
   of Moses and Aaron; but R. Aben Ezra thinks that all the righteous men
   of Israel are intended; and it is best to understand them of all the
   saints, especially when in a flourishing condition, and in the exercise
   of grace; who may be compared to the flowers of the field, 1. For the
   production of them: the covering of the earth with grass, herbs,
   plants, and beautiful flowers, in the spring-season, is a great
   instance of God's mighty power; it is no other than a kind of a
   recreation; this strange, though common change that is made in the
   earth by the returning spring, is elegantly described, as well as
   entirely referred to the divine Spirit by the royal Psalmist, thus,
   Psalm 104:30. "Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and
   thou renewest the face of the earth:" saints are flowers, not of man's,
   but of God's raising; they are not born of the will of man, nor of the
   "will of the flesh, but of God;" their grace, and all the flourishings
   of it, are not owing to their own care, diligence and industry, but to
   the power and spirit of God, who "worketh in them both to will and to
   do of his good pleasure; for this work of grace upon their souls, is a
   work of Almighty power, and is no less than a new creation; and whether
   we consider it in its first beginning, or in its after-growth and
   increase, it must be referred to a power superior to ours. 2. For their
   fragrancy: the persons of believers are of a sweet-smelling savor,
   being perfumed with Christ's mediation, and covered with the
   sweet-smelling garments of Christ's righteousness; and so are their
   services, their prayers and praises, put up and performed in the faith
   of Jesus. 3. For their beauty and ornament: how beautiful and glorious
   must those fields look, where roses are, and lilies grow; which in
   glory are equal with, nay, superior to the greatest of princes; for
   "Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these;" such as
   Sharon's field, and the roses and lilies there, which are here alluded
   to: saints are exceeding beautiful and glorious in Christ, and
   ornamental to him, being sanctified by his Spirit, and clothed with his
   righteousness. 4. Saints may be compared to flowers which appear on the
   earth in the spring-season with an air of gaiety and cheerfulness, on
   the account of that joy and consolation which their souls are possessed
   of when their grace is revived and in exercise; particularly when faith
   is, and when Christ returns to them, and they enjoy his presence; thus
   the blossoming and flourishing estate of the church is joined with joy
   and rejoicing, in Isaiah 35:1, 2. Now all this fragrancy, beauty, and
   flourishing condition of the saints, are owing to the arising of the
   sun of righteousness upon them, to the dews of divine grace, showers of
   boundless love, frequent waterings Of heaven, and to their being
   planted and growing in a fruitful soil, Christ Jesus: and perhaps it
   may not be amiss to interpret this of that large production and
   conversion of souls to Christ, and of that appearance of many beautiful
   flowers in the church of Christ in the first ages of Christianity; when
   saints appeared "in the beauties of holiness," and Christ had "the clew
   of his youth;" and which time was a delightful spring-season, after a
   long winter of Jewish and Gentile darkness.

   II.Another indication of the spring's being come, and which Christ
   makes use of as an argument to induce the church to arise and come
   away, is, that "the time of the singing of birds was come;" the spring,
   when birds begin to chirp and sing, to couple and build their nests;
   hence the spring is called ver nidificum. [317] Some [318] understand
   this of the time of cutting and pruning vines, or lopping trees; and to
   this purpose the Septuagint read the words thus, the time of cutting is
   come; [319] which agrees well enough with the first times of the
   gospel, when Christ's Father acted the part of an husband.. man, and
   lopped off the unfruitful branches the Jews, engrafted the Gentiles,
   caused them to bring forth fruit, and pruned them, that they might
   bring forth more; which seems well enough to agree with the season of
   the year, [320] the spring, at which time, especially at the beginning
   of it, vines were usually cut and pruned; some object to this as
   unseasonable: by the Targum, it is referred to the "time of cutting, or
   gathering in the first fruits; as it is also by some [321] to the
   gathering of flowers, making of garlands, etc. as well as applied by
   others [322] to the time of making incisures in the Balsam or
   Cyprus-trees in the vineyards of Engedi: but nothing is more agreeable
   than our version, and which is the sense that is gluten of the word by
   several Jewish writers [323] and exactly suits with the
   gospel-dispensation, in which, "from the uttermost parts of the earth,
   songs are heard," sung in warbling notes and tuneful lays. by souls
   called by divine grace; whose usual themes are, the grace and mercy of
   God the Father, the redeeming love of God the Son, the spiritual
   blessings in him; the glory of his righteousness to justify them, and
   the fullness of his grace and power to keep and preserve them: like
   little birds, they sit and chirp and sing the praises of the Lord, "in
   psalms, and hymns, and spiritual song;, making melody in their hearts
   unto him;" and this they do as well as they can in this imperfect life,
   though their hearts are often out of tune, and they sing with faint and
   feeble notes; but the time is coming, when they shall be clothed in
   white, have harps in their hands, hallelujahs in their mouths, and be
   employed in this delightful service for evermore. But however, this
   present gospel-dispensation may well be called a "time of the singing
   of birds," a time of joy and rejoicing, in comparison of the legal one,
   in which was heard, not the chirping and singing of birds, but "the
   sound of a trumpet," and "the voice of words," which were awful and
   terrible. This may not be ·unfitly applied to the singing of the
   angelic host those heavenly choiristers, at the birth of Christ (Luke
   2:13, 14).

   III.As a farther evidence of the spring's being come, and the more to
   allure her to arise and go with him [324] he says, that "the voice of
   the turtle was heard in their land;" which is a kind of dove, that, as
   naturalists [325] tell us, lies hid in the winter-time, and appears in
   the sprang; its voice is never heard in winter, unless on a fine clay.
   [326] By which may be meant, either the church, which is compared to a
   turtle-dove (Ps. 124:19). whose voice is heard in prayer to Christ; and
   who, in the preaching of the gospel, speaks of him, and in the public
   profession of his cause and interest, speaks for him; which voice, in
   verse 14. is very pleasant to him: or else, the voice of the Holy
   Ghost, according to the Targum, who once appeared in the form of a
   dove, and whose voice in the hearts of believers is very comfortable;
   for he speaks peace and pardon through Christ's blood, bears witness to
   our sonship, and is the pledge of our future inheritance: or the voice
   of God the Father, declaring his well-pleasedness in Christ, which was
   heard in Judea, both at his baptism and at his transfiguration upon the
   mount: or the voice of John the Baptist, [327] who was the forerunner
   of Christ, and declared him to be at hand; and so R. Alshech interprets
   it, of Elijah, that was to come before the Messiah, and cites the
   passage in Malachi 4:5 and others [328] understand it of the Messiah
   himself: or else, the voice of Christ himself, preaching the
   everlasting gospel; [329] R. Simeon Ben Jochai [330] understands it of
   the voice of the law in the days of the Messiah: but rather the gospel
   itself, that joyful sound of peace, pardon, righteousness, life and
   salvation by Christ, is meant; which was heard for a while only in
   Judea, which perhaps is the land here intended, called, by way of
   eminency and speciality, "our land;" though afterwards this voice was
   heard throughout the Gentile world: for Christ gave his disciples a
   commission to go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
   creature; who accordingly did, and their sound went into all the earth,
   and their words unto the ends of the world: and a joyful season it was,
   and still is to the poor Gentiles, where this voice is heard; and
   blessed be God, it is heard in our land.

Chapter 2 Verse 13

   EXPOSITION

   The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the
   tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and
   come away.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word the three former evidences of the spring, here are added two
   more.

   I."The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs."

   II."The vines with the tender grape give a good smell." As also,

   III.The former call is repeated, "Arise my love, my fair one, and come
   away."

   I.As a fourth evidence of the winter being over, and the spring being
   come, Christ tells his church, that the fig tree was putting forth her
   green figs; which is a full confirmation of its being come, nay, of its
   being pretty well advanced; for Christ, in Matthew 24:32. makes it a
   sign of the summer's being at hand, when the fig-tree shoots out its
   tender branches, and puts forth its leaves: Theopompus [331] speaks of
   figs in the middle of the spring; and Plutarch, of the vernal leaves of
   the fig-tree [332] R. Aben Ezra thinks, that the word translated,
   "putteth forth," signifies the sweetening of the figs, and so points
   out the time when the green or unripe figs begin to grow sweet and
   eatable: so that as the flowery fields would be delightful to her eye,
   and the chirping birds affect her ear; there were also figs ripening
   apace to please her taste; as the vines with the tender grape in the
   following instance, would give a refreshing odor to her smell; all
   which would be very entertaining to her, and one would think enough to
   invite her to arise and go with him. By the fig-tree, both the Targum
   and R. Aben Ezra understand the congregation of Israel; who they say,
   is here compared unto it; as indeed Israel is to the first ripe fruit
   of this tree, Hosea 9:10 and the godly among the captive Jews are, in
   Jeremiah 24:2-5. and therefore by. it may be meant the saints, putting
   forth their grace in exercise on Christ; who may be compared to
   fig-trees for the following reasons.

   1. The fig-tree is a tree full of large leaves, so large, that our
   first parents, after their fall, by sewing them together, made
   themselves aprons to cover their nakedness; which may be an emblem of a
   profession of religion, and of a conversation agreeable to it; which,
   though they ought to be found in us, yet are not sufficient to cover
   us; for we must also have Christ's righteousness put upon us, and his
   grace wrought in us, otherwise we shall be like the fig-tree, to which
   Christ came (Matthew 21:19), "and found nothing thereon but leaves
   only," And therefore, as the saints are like fig-trees that have the
   large ever-green and flourishing leaves of a Christian profession and
   gospel-conversation upon them; so, 2. They may be compared to them for
   their fruitfulness: the fig-tree is a tree that bears fruit as well as
   leaves, and that which is very wholesome, pleasant, and delightful; and
   if the Egyptian fig-tree is meant, that is said [333] to bear fruit
   seven times a year, and as soon as you gather one fig, immediately
   there is another: it is true, there are barren fig-trees, that have no
   fruit upon them; such an one is mentioned in Luke 13:6, 7, as there are
   also barren professors; but such are not the saints, who are filled and
   laden with the fruits of righteousness, and graces of the spirit, which
   they receive from Christ Jesus, from whom all their fruit is found: now
   as this is to be found from none but him, so neither is it found in any
   but in them; for, "do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of
   thistles?" it is impossible; this fruit appears upon no other tree but
   the fig-tree, and therefore by their fruits ye may know them. 3. It is
   a tree that puts forth its fruit before its leaves [334] which shews
   us, that though we ought to have the leaves of profession upon us yet
   the fruit of grace ought to precede it; and therefore when persons take
   upon them a profession of religion, and submit to the ordinances of
   Christ, care should be taken that they, as John says (Matthew 3:7),
   both have and bring forth fruits meet for repentance: there must be
   faith in the heart, as well as a confession of it in the mouth; and the
   one ought to go before the other; and both these make souls to appear
   honorable believers and professors; and such Christ's fig- trees are.
   4. It may not be amiss to observe, that the Egyptian fig-tree, which is
   no other than the sycamore, into which Zaccheus climbed to see Christ,
   Luke 19:4 may be here intended, seeing that there was great plenty of
   them in Judea, as is manifest from 1 Kings 10:27 though it is true,
   another word is used here, than what is there. Now of this tree, Pliny
   says [335] that when it is cut down and cast into the water, it sinks,
   being dry; but when it is thorough wet, it will swim: so saints, when
   they first enter the waters of affliction, like Peter, they sink; but
   when they have been more used to them, they lift up their heads above
   the waters of tribulation; and as good soldiers, with courage and
   magnanimity of mind, endure hardness; and do not sink in their spirits
   under the weight of reproaches, persecutions, and afflictions, laid
   upon them, being supported and borne up by Christ and his grace, 5. The
   same author [336] says, that this kind of fig-tree will not ripen any
   other way than by scratching it with iron hooks: men do not begin to
   grow in grace, or become fruitful in good works, until their hearts are
   pricked with the goads and nails of God's word, or till the fallow
   ground of their hearts is thrown up by the Spirit of God; nor will they
   grow afterwards to any purpose, unless Christ's Father, who is the
   husbandman, takes his pruning-knife in his hand, and uses it: and
   indeed some saints never grow better than when they are attended with
   tribulations and afflictions, like the people of Israel, in Egypt, or
   like. Christ's lilies among thorns.

   Moreover the green figs, which the fig-tree is said to put forth may
   intend, (1.) The beginnings of grace in the soul, which are like the
   young, green and unripe figs: that the fig, tree first puts forth; such
   as stirrings of affection to Christ, desires after a saving knowledge
   of him, and interest in him, pantings and breathings after the
   ordinances of Christ, and love to his people: all which appear very
   soon in the soul, and discover the work of grace begun, though as yet
   it is but very imperfect. For, (2.) These green and unripe figs shew
   the imperfection of grace in the saints; grace in the best is very
   imperfect in this state of life, much more must it be when it is first
   put forth; the work of grace in us, though it will be performed, yet at
   present is but a begun one, and not a finished one: saints are not
   arrived to the perfection they shall; they are but like green figs, and
   especially young converts. (3.) These beginnings of grace in the soul,
   being compared to green figs, shew, that grace is liable to be lost,
   and would be so, was it not for the almighty power which preserves it
   and increases it; for of all fruit, none is more easily shaken off by
   the wind and lost, than green and unripe figs are; see Nahum 3:12. it
   is no less than a miracle of grace, that those first impressions are
   not wholly erased by the impetuous force of corruptions within; or that
   these precious blossoms are not entirely blown off by the blustering
   winds of Satan's temptations; or that our naughty hearts do not of
   themselves, as the fig-tree, cast off this unripe fruit: this is all
   owing to mighty, powerful, and efficacious grace. (4.) It may also be
   observed, that grace, though imperfect, is taken notice of by Christ;
   yea, in the very infancy of it, as soon as ever it begins to appear,
   even when in its bud and blossom: so far is he from despising the day
   of small things; where there is but little grace and little strength,
   as in the church of Philadelphia, he observes it, and does not crush
   it, but increases it; for "a bruised reed shall he not break, and the
   smoking flax shall he not quench," Isaiah 42:3. (5.) It may be remarked
   from hence, that grace being in exercise in others, though weak, should
   be an argument and motive to excite and stir up ours; and indeed it is
   disgraceful and dishonorable to old professors, for young converts to
   be more active and lively in the exercise of grace than they. Christ
   seems to press this argument here upon the church.

   Again, the putting forth these green figs, signifies the exercise of
   grace on Christ, which saints put forth unto him, not by virtue of a
   power of their own, hut by virtue of his grace, which enables them to
   do it; for the putting forth of these green figs, is owing to the
   warming and quickening influences of the Sun of righteousness: the
   beginning, increase, and perfection of grace, are all from Christ; the
   implantation of it in the soul, and the exercise of it, depend upon
   him. But,

   II.As a fifth and last evidence of the spring's being come and which
   puts it beyond all doubt, is, the flourishing of the vines, "the vines,
   with the tender grape, give a good smell." Fig-trees and vines are
   frequently mentioned together in scripture, as in Psalm 105:33. Micah
   4:4 and in many other places; and one reason is, because they grew
   together; for fig-trees were planted in vineyards, as is manifest from
   Luke 13:6. nay, it is judged by naturalists, [337] to be very proper
   they should grow together: one sort of figs, the black fig, is called
   the sister of the vine. [338]

   By vines may be meant, the several distinct congregated churches of
   Christ, or else particular believers (see Ps. 80:14, 15; Isa. 5:7,
   27:3), who may be called so, 1. Because of their fruitfulness: the vine
   is a fruit-bearing tree, it produces very fine and excellent fruit;
   especially the vines in the land of Canaan did, of which there is a
   famous instance in Numbers 13:23 saints being engrafted in Christ
   Jesus, the true vine, and receiving life and nourishment from him, do,
   by abiding in him, bring forth much fruit, and such as is not to be
   found in others; not wild and sour grapes, such as Christ's Father
   takes no delight in, but such as he is pleased with, and glorified by.
   2. Because of their dependence on Christ: the vine-tree does not grow
   up erect of itself; for if it is not fixed to a wall with nails [339]
   or supported by something else which it lays hold on, it creeps along
   the ground: saints do not grow up erect of themselves, but lean upon
   Christ, are supported by him, and so grow up in him. 3. For their
   tallness in Christ: vines being propped, will run up a great height;
   saints being engrafted in, and upheld by Christ, who is himself higher
   than the heavens, grow up from shrubs to taller trees; from babes in
   Christ, to "the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;" and,
   by virtue of grace and strength, received from him, arise from a low
   and mean state and condition unto a much higher one, until at length
   they arrive unto the full possession of the "prize of the high calling
   of God in Christ Jesus." 4. For their weakness and unusefulness in
   themselves; the vine is a weak tree, and, as has been observed, cannot
   bear up itself: saints, they are weak in themselves, though strong in
   Christ; they can do nothing of themselves; neither perform duties,
   subdue corruptions, nor withstand temptations; but they" can do all
   things through Christ strengthening them." The wood of the vine is of
   very little worth or use, as appears from Ezekiel 15:2, 3 and is
   obvious enough to every one's observation: saints are but poor,
   worthless, and unprofitable creatures of themselves; their best works
   and most excellent performances, are neither profitable to God, nor can
   they procure salvation to themselves; but are all as an unclean thing,
   and as filthy rags; they are unworthy of the least mercy they enjoy,
   and therefore it is a wonder of grace that God should in any respect be
   mindful of them. 5. For their durableness: though the wood of the vine
   is but weak and worthless, yet it is said to be very lasting and
   durable; Pliny ascribes eternity to it, and says of it [340] nec est
   ligno ulli aternior natura, no wood is of a more eternal or durable
   nature than this is: saints, however weak and worthless in themselves,
   yet shall continue and abide for ever in Christ; they are born of an
   incorruptible seed; they are built upon a rock, and secured by almighty
   power, so as they shall never perish, but shall for ever enjoy the
   incorruptible inheritance that is reserved for them.

   Also these vines are said to have the tender grape upon them. The word
   translated the tender grape, is only used in this song, and that but in
   two other places besides this, viz. verse 15. of this chapter, and
   chapter 7:12 but is used both in the Targum [341] and Misnah [342] in
   the same sense. Most of the Jewish writers [343] think, that by it is
   meant the small and tender grape, which appears as soon as ever the
   flower is fallen off, when the vines begin to knot, and one grape can
   be known, and may be distinguished from another; which sense our
   version expresses. But I am rather inclined to think that it means the
   flower itself; for in the Targum on Isaiah 18:5 this word rdms smadar,
   is used to express the Hebrew word hxn nitzab, which signifies a
   flower; and not only Pliny [344] and others, but the scriptures also
   testify, that vines do blossom and flower, as in the afore-mentioned
   place, Isaiah 18:5 and in Genesis 40:10 and the good smell which these
   vines are said to give, seems best to be understood of their time of
   flowering, than of any other time; for it is reported of some vines
   [345] and perhaps may be true of the vines which grew in Judea, seeing
   that the wine of Lebanon is commended for its agreeable odor, Hosea
   14:7. I say, It is reported of some vines, that in the time of their
   flowering they send forth so sweet a smell, that not only the vineyards
   themselves, but the country round about is refreshed with the sweet
   savor thereof; so that walking or sitting among them is both wholesome
   and delightful; nay, that the smell of them is so great, that serpents
   and other venomous creatures are driven away by it. So then the words
   may be rendered thus, "the vines, being in flower, give a good smell."
   [346] How by these tender grapes, flowers, or blossoms of the vines,
   may be meant, either the graces of the Spirit in their first
   appearance, as before; or else, young converts, to which I rather
   incline, who are the fruit of Christ's vine, the church; and though
   very weak and tender, yet are very dear unto, and are much regarded by
   Christ; and when there is a large appearance, of them, it is a great
   encouragement to the church, and promises a glorious vintage: so the
   Targum interprets it of young men and babes praising the Lord at the
   Red Sea, for their deliverance out of the hands of the Egyptians: and
   R. Sol. Jarchi says, it is explained of repenting sinners, in an
   ancient book of theirs, called Pesikta; and so I find it is also in
   another book of theirs, called Raya Mehimna. [347]

   Moreover, these vines having their tender grapes upon them, or being in
   flower, are said to give a good smell; which must be understood of the
   fragrancy of the persons of believers, being clothed with the
   sweet-smelling garments of Christ's righteousness, and the delightful
   odor, of their graces being exercised on his person; as well as of
   their sweet savor, Which their pious and godly conversations send forth
   to all that know them, or are about them.

   III.Christ having given such full demonstrations of the spring being
   come, renews his call to the church, and says again, "Arise, my love;
   my fair one, and come away;" which repetition shews, 1. Our
   backwardness and sluggishness: we need one call after another, one
   exhortation upon another, and all will not do, unless the power of
   divine grace is exerted; for alter repeated calls, we shall sleep on
   and take no notice, as the disciples did, being overborne with a body
   of sin and death. 2. It manifests the exceeding greatness of his love
   to us, and care of us; that though we have backslidden from him, yet he
   calls us back again; and though backward to his calls, yet he persists
   in them, and all along uses the most endearing and tender language to
   work upon us: he gives no other words but such as these, "my love, and
   my fair one." 3. It is a plain indication that he is unwilling that we
   should be without him, or he without us; and therefore having taken the
   most winning methods, and used the most prevailing arguments, he
   repeats the call. 4. It shews his importunity, and that he will have no
   denial; [348] and indeed one would think there could be none given,
   when both our pleasure and profit are so much concerned in it; and what
   he calls us to, tends so much to advance both; and there will be none,
   and can be none, when he exerts the mighty power of his grace.

Chapter 2 Verse 14

   O my dove! that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of
   the stairs: let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for
   sweet is thy voice, thy countenance is comely.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are the words of Christ to his church; and may be considered
   either as coming immediately out of his own mouth; or else, as recorded
   and related by her, as the former were: in which may be considered;

   I.The title or character which Christ gives to his church; "my dove."

   II.Her then present place of residence; "in the clefts of the rock, in
   the secret places of the stairs."

   III.A request which he makes, which consists of two parts. 1st, That he
   might see her countenance. 2dly, Hear her voice.

   IV.The motives or arguments that he makes use of to prevail with her;
   which are also of two sorts, suited to both parts of the request, 1st,
   Because her voice was sweet. 2dly, Her countenance was comely.

   I.Here we meet with a new title or character given by Christ to his
   church, "my dove;" an epithet sometimes used by lovers: [349] he had
   called her his love and his fair one before, but not his dove, till
   now; though it is true, he had compared her eyes to doves eyes, in
   chapter 1:15. Now the church may be compared to the dove, for the
   following reasons: 1. The dove is a very beautiful creature; so is the
   church, as she is washed in Christ's blood, justified by his
   righteousness, and sanctified by his grace; for though, while in a
   state of nature, she lay among the pots, and so looked black and
   uncomely; yet now being called by, and made a partaker of divine grace,
   she looks like "the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her
   feathers with yellow gold." 2. It is a very cleanly creature; [350] it
   loves cleanliness; it keeps its own body clean, and teaches its young
   to carry their dung out of their nests; it feeds only upon pure grain,
   and delights in clean water: the church, or believers in Christ, are
   not only clean through the word which Christ has spoken, but also have
   their hearts "purified by faith in his blood, and delight in purity of
   life and conversation.

   3. It is a very innocent and harmless creature; and therefore Christ
   says to his disciples (Matthew 10:16), "Be ye wise as serpents, and
   harmless as doves:" believers are, or at least should be, "blameless,
   harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and
   perverse nation;" they should live not only inoffensive to the world,
   but also peaceably and quietly among themselves; not biting and
   devouring one another; not acting the part of wolves and tigers; but
   behaving themselves as Christ's innocent sheep and harmless doves. 4.
   It is an exceeding loving and chaste creature to its mate; [351] it
   inviolably keeps its conjugal faith; adultery is rarely known among
   these creatures, and, whenever committed, is punished with death; for
   males will tear a male to pieces, and a female a female that is found
   guilty of it: it is also reported of the turtle-dove [352] that upon
   the loss of its mate, it remains inconsolable; does not couple again,
   but continues a widow, and lives a mournful and sorrowful life,
   avoiding every thing that might tend to remove it, and create pleasure;
   and that whereas before it delighted in pure and clean water, it now
   will not drink until it has first bemudded it; nor will it sit upon
   green and flourishing, but upon dry and withered branches of trees--all
   which is a lively emblem of the church, who is presented as a chaste
   virgin to Christ, Who bears an exceeding great love and affection to
   him, and whose absence is what she cannot bear, 5. It is a very
   fruitful creature; tho' it has not many young ones, at a time [353] yet
   has them very often; AElianus says [354] that it has young ones ten
   times in a year; nay, in Egypt, twelve times: the church, who is
   married to Christ, is not only fruit, ful in grace and good works, but
   also brings forth many souls unto him, which has been and will be still
   more eminently seen in the Gentile church; see Isaiah 54:1. 6. It is a
   sociable creature; doves flock together as birds of a feather usually
   do: so saints delight to be in each other's company; they join in
   fellowship one with another, and carry on a social worship together;
   and do not forsake the assembling of themselves together, as the manner
   of some too often is. 7. It is a weak and impotent creature, and is
   often oppressed by birds of prey: the church is often distressed and
   persecuted by the men of the world, and forced to fly into holes and
   corners, as the dove does. 8. It is a very fearful and timorous
   creature; hence Ephraim is compared to the trembling dove [355] in
   Hosea 11:11 saints are often in trembling fits, at the word of God, and
   in the exercise of their faith on Christ; under a sense of their own
   vileness, and in the apprehension of their weakness and want of power
   to keep and preserve themselves. 9. It has a mournful voice: saints are
   like doves of the valleys, mourning every one for their iniquities; and
   often for the loss of Christ's presence, which they are frequently
   deprived of, through their unbecoming carriage to him. 10. It feeds
   only upon pure grain: the church feeds only on Christ, and on the
   wholesome words or comfortable doctrines of the everlasting gospel; she
   cannot live upon husks that swine eat, nor will she be fed with the
   chaff of man's invention. 11. It is also very swift in flying; and
   therefore David wished for the wings of a dove, that he might flee
   away, and be at rest: souls, in their fleeing to Christ for life and
   salvation, move as swift as the manslayer did from the avenger of blood
   to the city of refuge; and afterwards, under all their trials and
   afflictions, he is the strong tower, whither they run and are safe: and
   then more especially, may they be said to be as doves, when they are
   upon the wing of faith, and mount up as eagles do, run and are not
   weary, and walk and faint not.

   Lastly, It is reported of the dove [356] that it will allure wild doves
   by its familiar converses into the dove-house with it: those who are
   called by grace, will use all proper ways and methods to allure and
   gain others to Christ, and to a compliance with his ways and
   ordinances, as the church does the daughters of Jerusalem in this Song;
   she being a great lover of the society of saints, and of the glory of
   Christ therein; as the dove is of its own country, particularly of its
   own dove-house, and especially when near the habitations of men.

   Now Christ's calling the church by this name, "my dove," not only shews
   his interest in her, but also his affection to her and perhaps the
   principal thing he had in view, was to assure her of it, and to
   encourage her in her present condition; though she was in the cleft of
   the rock, in a poor, desolate, and forlorn condition, yet she was his
   dove still; which is the next thing to be considered. For,

   II.She is said to be "in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places
   of the stairs;" which may be understood, either in allusion to the
   usual place where the dove makes her nest, which is in the rock [357]
   and "in the sides of the hole's mouth," (see Jer. 48:28) and
   Adrichomius [358] tells us, that there was a stone tower near
   Jerusalem, southward of the mount of Olives, called Petra Columbarum,
   "the rock of the doves," where often five thousand doves were kept at
   one time; and perhaps here maybe an allusion to it: or else, it may be
   understood of the place where doves are forced to fly, when pursued by
   the hawk, even into a hollow rock, as described by Homer: [359] and so
   may be expressive of the state of the church under persecution, when
   saints are forced to flee into holes and corners, and cannot openly and
   publicly, worship God, as they used to do, according to his mind and
   will; but even then God has his hiding-places for them, where he
   protects and preserves them until the heat of the persecution is over;
   for at such a time God will have a church, it shall never be entirely
   rooted out; neither shall hi people be without his presence, and some
   visible manifestations of himself unto them; for he has as great a love
   for them as ever: the church is his dove then, and her countenance is
   as comely, and her voice as sweet as ever; nor would he have her be
   disconsolate and disheartened in her present condition. Most of the
   Jewish writers [360] refer the words to the condition that the people
   of Israel were in, when they were pursued by Pharaoh at the Red Sea;
   which seems, in some measure, to agree with the former sense which has
   been given. Or else, by the clefts of the rock, may be meant, either,
   1. The eternal decree of election, in which, as in an immoveable and
   inaccessible rock, the church dwelt from all eternity, and will do so
   unto all eternity; which is the sense that Junius. gives of these
   words; God's eternal decree of election is as immoveable as a rock; it
   is a foundation that stands sure, being laid, not upon the conditions
   of faith and holiness in the creature, but upon the sovereign will and
   pleasure of that God, who, "will have mercy on whom he will have
   mercy," and "will be gracious to whom he will be gracious; whose
   purposes cannot be disannulled, nor his counsel made void, nor he ever
   be frustrated of his end, for the thoughts of his heart shall stand to
   all generations; and as the decree of election is immoveable,
   irrevocable, and cannot be altered, so the doctrine of it will stand,
   maugre all opposition, and will prove a burdensome stone to all those
   that set themselves against it. Now in the clefts of this rock, the
   people of God dwell as in a hidden and secret place before conversion;
   it being neither known to themselves nor others, that they are the
   objects of it, until called by divine grace; and here they dwell
   secure, and are safely preserved, notwithstanding the fill of Adam, and
   their own actual sins and transgressions, until the grace that is laid
   up for them is actually bestowed upon them; for every one that dwells
   here, shall be called and sanctified, and at last eternally glorified;
   not one shall be lost, nor any one link in the golden chain of
   salvation ever be broken; of which we have an account in Romans 8:30.
   "Whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called,
   them he also justified; and whom he justified: them he also glorified:"
   moreover, these persons are and ever were the objects of Christ's love,
   and so they ever shall be; his love was set upon them, and his delights
   were with them before the world began; these are his doves, and this
   the place of their habitation. Or else, 2. By this rock may be meant
   Christ, who frequently bears this character in scripture, and
   particularly is said (1 Cor. 10:4) to be that spiritual rock, of which
   the Jews drank in the wilderness: and by the clefts thereof, may be
   meant the wounds of Christ, [361] which were opened for the salvation
   of sinners, and in which believers dwell by faith; and perhaps to this
   the allusion is made in Exodus 33:22 where it is said, that God put
   Moses into the cleft of the rock, and made his glory to pass before
   him; for the glory of all the divine perfections is no where so
   manifestly seen as in a crucified Christ. Now saints are the
   inhabitants of this rock; here Christ's church dwells, and that safely,
   being built upon a rock, against which the gates of hell cannot
   prevail; this is her fortress and strong-hold, where she need not be
   afraid of any enemy whatever, for her place of defense is the munition
   of rocks; and therefore, whenever under any apprehension of danger, she
   betakes herself to her stronghold, to Christ, the rock that is higher
   than she. Moreover, the church being said to dwell here, not only shews
   the safety of her state, but also her majesty and greatness, and her
   exaltation above others; see Jeremiah 49:16 for dwelling in a rock, she
   dwells on high; she is not now in the miry clay, but her feet are set
   upon a rock and her goings are established; she is not now upon the
   dunghill, but upon the throne; not in a mean cottage, but in a
   well-built, strong, and fortified castle. Indeed the other phrase, the
   secret of the stairs, seems to denote abasement and humiliation; though
   it may be better understood of Christ; as the former expression seems
   robe; for Christ is the stairs or ladder which Jacob saw in a vision,
   which reached from earth to heaven; he being God and man in one person,
   has, by his, mediation, blood and sacrifice, made peace between God and
   sinful, man, reconciled those two contending parties, brought heaven
   and earth as it were together, and filled up that vast distance that
   there was between them; he is the ladder or those stairs also, on which
   the angels of God ascended and descended (see Gen. 28:12 compared with
   John 1:51); he is likewise our way of access to God, by whom, as by
   steps, we ascend to him, have admittance into his presence, and are
   indulged with communion with him: now in the secret of these stairs or
   steps, did the church lie, as the dove is said to do in some hidden
   place during the winter season; which was the case of Christ's dove
   here, (see verse 11) for Christ is the "hiding-place from the wind, and
   a covert from the tempest;" and if any thing is particularly intended
   by the secret of the stairs, Christ's; justifying righteousness seems
   not unlikely; which is secret and hidden to the men of the world, and
   is only revealed in the gospel from faith to faith: hither souls betake
   themselves in times of distress and, by it they are screened and
   sheltered from sin, law, hell and death; and dwelling here, they are in
   safety; for "he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high,
   shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty." The Ethiopic version
   renders it, in the shadow of the rock to which Christ is compared (Isa.
   32:2), and so the Septuagint version, in the covering of the rock;
   [362] which is the shade of it: which seems to be a better sense than
   what some Jewish writers [363] give of the words, who interpret them of
   the sanctuary or temple, and of the holy of holies, which was in it.
   But,

   III.I shall now consider the request which he makes unto her, which
   consists of two parts, 1st, That he might "see her countenance," 2dly,
   "Hear her voice."

   1st, He desires that she would shew him her countenance; which supposes
   that she had either covered her face, as mourners do, and was bemoaning
   her present state and condition, bewailing her inward corruptions, as
   well as her outward afflictions: or else, that she was filled with
   shame, under a sense of sin, and blushed, as Ezra did, and could not
   lift up her head and eyes to Christ; but smiting upon her breast, like
   the poor publican, discovered the inward confusion of her mind: or
   else, that she was attended with fear, and that not so much with a fear
   of her enemies, as of his displeasure; being conscious to herself that
   she had acted an unbecoming part towards him: or rather, that she was
   filled with shamefacedness and bashfulness, and could not, with an holy
   boldness and an allowed freedom, approach his presence: unless we
   understand it of the state of the church under the Old Testament, in
   opposition to this under the New; when the face of the church was
   veiled, and she only saw Christ through dark shadows and typical
   ordinances; whereas we now, "with open face, behold, as in a glass, the
   glory of the Lord;" And now, what Christ would have her do in
   opposition to all this, is, to lift up her head with joy, exercise
   faith upon him; use freedom with him, come with boldness to him, and
   look him full in the face, and keep always looking to him for every
   fresh supply of grace, and whatever she might stand in need-of; he
   would not have her be shy and bashful, fearful and faithless; but free
   and familiar with him, with whom he would assure her she, might. Unless
   we would rather understand it of his desire, that she would appear more
   publicly in his worship, and not lurk in holes and corners, in the
   clefts of rocks, and under dusty stairs; but shew "herself in his
   house, and in the courts of it, and "present herself a living
   sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which was but "her reasonable
   service;" and especially seeing there was now no danger, for the storms
   were over, "the winter was past, and the rain was over and gone."

   2dly, He desires that he might hear her voice. Believers should not be
   dumb when Christ would have them speak: there is a dumbness or silence
   which is laudable, and that is, either when they are under the
   afflicting hand of God, or are vilified and reproached for the sake of
   Christ and his gospel; but then there is a dumbness which is not so:
   for as there is a time to keep silence, so there is "a time to speak."
   1. Believers should speak of Christ; of what he is in himself, of the
   glory of his person, the excellency of his righteousness the efficacy
   of his blood, and the sufficiency of his, grace; they should also speak
   of what he is unto them, being of God made unto them, "wisdom,
   righteousness, sanctification and redemption;" of what characters he
   bears, and of what relations he stands in to them, as well as of what
   he has done for them, in redeeming them, and calling them by a his
   grace. 2. They should speak for Christ, as well as of him; and as he is
   a person that is much spoken against by the men of the world, therefore
   believers should speak for him, in vindication of his person, cause and
   interest; boldly assert the truths of his gospel; bravely bear a
   testimony against all errors, both in doctrine and worship; and not be
   afraid of men or their revilings. 3. They should speak to Christ; and
   this perhaps is the voice which Christ more especially desired to hear;
   they should speak to him in prayer, in praises and thanksgivings, and
   ascribe all the glory of their salvation to him; which is but just and
   reasonable in itself, becoming them, and makes for the advancement Of
   Christ's glory.

   IV.The motives or arguments he makes use of to prevail upon her, to
   grant him what he desired of her, are these two; 1st, The sweetness of
   her voice. 2dly; The comeliness of her countenance: which he mentions,
   not only to shew what induced him to make the request; but also to
   encourage her to grant it.

   1st, He says, that her "voice was sweet;" that is, grateful,
   acceptable, and exceeding well-pleasing; and therefore he desired to
   hear it; which she had no reason to be ashamed of. Herodotus [364]
   makes mention of a dove that spoke with an human voice; such a voice
   Christ's dove speaks with, and is very grateful to him; the voice as
   well as the countenance of lovers, is very pleasing; [365] and such was
   the voice of the church, 1. In speaking of Christ, of what he is in
   himself and what he is to her, and has done for her, is sweet unto him;
   he loves to hear his people streak of these things; we are told (Mal.
   3:16), that "they that feared the Lord, spake often one to another;"
   and what did they speak of? no doubt of the excellency of Christ of
   what he had done for, shewn unto, and wrought in them: now what
   acceptance did this meet with from him? why, "he hearkened and heard
   it, and a book of remembrance was written before him" of all they spake
   of one to another, 2. Her voice in speaking for him, confessing his
   name, and bearing a testimony to his truths, is sweet unto him; for he
   says (Matthew 10:32), that "whosoever shall confess him before men, him
   will he confess before his father which is in heaven;" but as for those
   who are "ashamed of him and of his words" here on earth, he highly
   resents, and will be ashamed of them another day, and in another world.
   3. Her voice in speaking to Christ is sweet; whether it be in prayer or
   in praise; her voice in prayer is so; and thus the Targum. paraphrases
   the words, "let me hear thy voice, for thy voice is sweet in prayer in
   the house of the little sanctuary." The prayer of a poor believer makes
   sweet music in Christ's ears; nothing is so delightful to him; so
   little reason have souls to be discouraged, or fear a kind reception of
   their petitions with him: and so her voice in praise and thanksgiving
   is sweet unto him; praise is not only pleasant in itself, and comely in
   us, but is also exceeding delightful to him; this "pleases the Lord
   better than an ox or bullock that has horns and hoofs." (Ps. 69:30, 31)

   2dly, He tells her, that her "countenance was comely;" that is,
   beautiful, and much to be desired; and this Christ says, not only in
   opposition to what she was in the esteem of the world, who counted her
   as the off-scouring of it, but also to what he was in her esteem, who
   looked upon herself as black and uncomely, and therefore was ashamed to
   lift up her head, or to have her countenance seen by him; therefore, in
   order to remove her unbelief, bashfulness, and misgivings of hearty he
   declares what she was in his esteem, whose judgment is preferable to
   her own, and to all others beside; for in his opinion, she was "the
   fairest among women," of a beautiful aspect and comely countenance,
   being made perfectly comely through that comeliness which he had put
   upon her: he saw no iniquity in her, nor any spot upon her, as clothed
   with his righteousness; she was in his eye a "perfection of beauty;"
   having the most just symmetry and proportion of parts, the most
   agreeable shape, and the most lovely features in her face; her cheeks,
   being "comely with rows of jewels, and her neck with chains of gold,"
   as in chapter 1:10. Faith is most properly the believer's face or
   countenance, by which he looks on. Christ, and views a fullness and
   suitableness in him, and expects all needful supplies from him; which
   look of faith on Christ, for life and salvation, is exceeding pleasant,
   nay, ravishing to him; and therefore he would have his church behold
   him again and again; for saints never appear more comely in Christ's,
   eye, than when they take a full view of him.

Chapter 2 Verse 15

   Take us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines:
   for our vines have tender grapes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words are the words of Christ or of the church, is not
   so manifest. Some think that they are the words of the church, to whom
   the care of the vineyard was committed; which, though she had in some
   measure neglected, as appears from chapter 1:6, yet now is heartily
   concerned for the flourishing of it; and therefore calls upon her
   attendants and companions to assist in destroying those noxious
   creatures the foxes, which did so much mischief to the vines that grew
   in it; though they rather seem to be. the words of Christ, who is the
   owner of the vineyard, and has an authoritative power over the officers
   of the church, and ministers of the gospel, to stir them up to be
   sedulous and careful in the. discharge of their work; for the words
   seem to be directed, not to angels, nor to his bride, the church, nor
   to the civil magistrate, but to ministers, who are more particularly
   employed in the care of Christ's vineyard: and if we take them to be
   the words of Christ, it not only shews the power and authority of
   Christ over those he speaks to, and lays his commands on in so strict a
   manner; but also his love to, and care of his vines, the several
   churches, which his own right hand has planted: though perhaps they may
   be the words of them both jointly together; for the church, with
   Christ, and under him, has a right to stir up her officers to perform
   their work, and fulfill their ministry, which they have received of the
   Lord Jesus; the doing of which will redound to his glory, and her good;
   they both having an interest in the vines here mentioned; also the
   foxes, which they are ordered to take, were common enemies; both to
   Christ and his church; and therefore it is not said, "take for me or
   thee, but take for us the foxes." In these words may be observed,

   I.A command that is laid upon the ministers of the gospel, to "take the
   foxes, even the little foxes."

   II.Some arguments or motives proposed to stir them up to an observance
   of it.

   I.The thing enjoined them is, to "take the foxes." By foxes we are to
   understand, either,

   1st, The sins and corruptions of our nature, which may be compared unto
   them for the following reasons: 1. As foxes have their lurking-holes in
   the earth, so have these in the hearts of men, where they lie a long
   time undiscovered; and that not only in the hearts of wicked men, but
   also in the hearts of God's own people; and therefore, says David (Ps.
   19:12), "Who can under, stand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
   faults;" now it is only the Spirit of God, who "searcheth the deep
   things of God," that can search the inmost recesses of our hearts,
   discover our vile corruptions, bring them out of their lurking-holes,
   and slay them by the mighty power of his grace. 2. The sins and
   corruptions of our nature may be compared to foxes for their
   deceitfulness, therefore are they called "deceitful lusts;" and wed
   they may, for we are often imposed upon by them, and deceived with
   them, and that under the notion either of pleasure, profit, or honor,
   which they promise to us, but leave us entirely short of: there is a
   deceitfulness in sin, which makes our hearts so deceitful, and
   desperately wicked as they be. 3. For the crooked ways which they take:
   the fox [366] does not walk straight forward, but with several windings
   and turnings; the ways of sin are all crooked ways; they are so many
   distortions from the ways of God and godliness which are straight and
   even; and are so many aberrations from the divine law, which is the
   rule of our obedience unto God. 4. For making places barren and desert
   [367] wherever they come: sin makes persons barren and. unfruitful,
   both in the knowledge of Christ, and in the performance of duty; so
   that they look like "the heath in the desert," and like "parched places
   in the wilderness." 5. For their friendship with serpents: [368] there
   is a secret correspondence held between Satan, that old serpent, and
   the corruptions of our nature; by virtue of which he often compasses
   his end, and gains his purpose, which he could not do on Christ, there
   being no such matter for him to work upon; he had none of his old
   friends there to let him in, as he has in our hearts.

   Now the ministers of the gospel may be said to take these foxes, when
   they lift up their voices like a trumpet, and exclaim against them,
   expose the Wickedness and deceitfulness of them and shew souls the
   danger they are in by them; when they are made useful to bring persons
   under a conviction of them, and, as it were, to ferret them out of
   their lurking-holes: moreover," by the power of the Spirit of God
   attending the ministry, the strong-holds of sin" are pulled down, and
   the vain imaginations, of men's hearts subdued, and every vile thought
   brought "into captivity, to the obedience of Christ," and a revenge
   taken upon all disobedience. Not but that private Christians, as well
   as ministers, should watch and pray against them; fight in order to
   take them, and, when taken, should bring them to Christ, as his and
   their enemies, to be slain by the mighty power of his grace; and not
   only gross sins, but even "little foxes," the very first motions of
   sin, are to be watched against and struck at; we should abstain from
   all appearance of it," knowing that lesser sins will bring us into the
   commission of greater, and insensibly grow upon us; so R. Alshech
   interprets these little foxes of little sins. Or else,

   2dly, By these foxes may be meant false teachers or heretics; so the
   false prophets in Ezekiel's time were called by him (Ezek. 13:3, 4), "O
   Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts;" and so may
   false apostles and false teachers now, and that for the following
   reasons; 1. For their craftiness, and subtilty. The fox is remarkable
   for its cunning and craftiness, of which some writers give us many
   instances: sometimes he feigns himself dead, lies upon his back, with
   his mouth open, and his tongue out, so that he looks every way as a
   dead carcass; by which means he invites the fowls of the air to feed
   upon him, but when come, devours them with open mouth; [369] for the
   same purpose, at other times, he rolls himself in the red earth, that
   he might appear as bloody, and then, as before, lays himself down upon
   the ground as dead, and thereby lays a bait for the unwary birds: so
   when he is taken in a snare, and finds that there is no escaping, he
   prostrates himself upon the ground, holds his breath, and in all
   appearance seems dead, which the snare-setter supposing to be real,
   looses the snare, without any suspicion of his escaping; but finding
   himself free, gets upon his legs, and away he runs: also when hunted,
   he will run among a flock of sheep or goats, and leap upon the back of
   some one of them, which puts the whole flock into a fright, and causes
   them to run one after another, and, for fear of damage, the huntsman is
   obliged to call in his dogs: these, with many other instances of his
   subtilty, as his artful method of catching crabs and lobsters with his
   tail: destroying of wasps, clearing himself of fleas, tricking the
   hedge-hog, revenging himself upon the badger, and catching of hares,
   are recorded by several writers. [370] Hence false teachers may be very
   fitly compared unto them, who act in disguise, lie in wait to deceive,
   walk in craftiness, and handle the word of God deceitfully, speak lies
   in hypocrisy, use good words and fair speeches, and thereby deceive the
   hearts of the simple. 2. For their malignity: foxes are cruel as well
   as cunning, they are very noxious and hurtful creatures; and so are
   false teachers, they are wolves though in sheep's Clothing; their
   heresies are damnable, their doctrines are pernicious, and their words
   eat as doth a canker; they subvert the faith of some, and bring ruin
   and destruction upon themselves and others, 3. For their hunger and
   voraciousness: all the cunning and cruelty that the fox uses, is to
   satisfy his greedy appetite; and so the principal end of false
   teachers, is not to serve Christ, but their own bellies; to devour
   widows" houses, and making merchandise of others, to enrich themselves,
   and indulge their own pride and vanity. 4. For their feigning
   themselves to be domestics: it is reported of the fox [371] that when
   it draws nigh to a farm-house, it will mimic the barking of a dog,
   which the hens and geese being used to, walk about with less guards and
   with more confidence approach to him, and so are surprised and devoured
   by him; so false teachers put on sheep's clothing, transform themselves
   into angels of light, as their master before them has done; mimic the
   voice of Christ's ministers; use some phrases and expressions which
   they do, which serve as a blind to the people; and so craftily do they
   put their words together, that it is not an easy thing to discover
   them. 5. As foxes are filthy, abominable, and stinking creatures, so
   are these, not only to God, but to his people; and therefore are also
   compared to wolves and dogs; and are not so much as to be received into
   the houses of good people, nor to be hid God-speed by them.

   Now the ministers of the gospel are to take these foxes; they being
   overseers of the flock, and keepers of Christ's vineyard; are to watch
   against them, and make a discovery of them, they are to oppose and
   refute their erroneous doctrines; and being detected, and convicted of
   heresies, they are with the church after proper admonitions given, to
   reject and cut them off from the church, and communion with it: it is
   true, they are not to take away their lives, but they are to exclude
   them, from fellowship with them, and not suffer them to continue with
   them, either as members or officers; nay; even the little foxes are to
   be taken. Heresy is compared to leaven; the erroneous doctrines of the
   Scribes and Pharisees are called so, and "a little leaven leaveneth the
   whole lump." Heresies and heretics are to be nipped in the bud,,
   otherwise they will increase to more ungodliness; great things have
   rose from small beginnings: these things should be taken in time; for
   errors, seemingly small at first, have grown larger, have spread
   themselves, and have been very fatal to the churches of Christ;
   therefore no error or heresy should be connived at, under a notion of
   its being a small or a harmless one; for even little foxes are to be
   taken. Some [372] connect the word little with the vines next
   mentioned; and so it strengthens the reason, why care should be taken
   to preserve them from the foxes, since they are small and tender.

   3dly, Here are motives and arguments proposed to induce a compliance to
   this command of Christ's. 1. The mischief Which these foxes do to the
   vines, is made use of as one, which spoil the vines: it has been
   observed by many [373] that these kind of creatures do hurt to the
   vines; and that by destroying the fences, knawing the branches, biting
   the bark, making bare the roots of the vines, devouring the ripe grapes
   thereof, and infecting all with their noxious teeth and vicious breath:
   so heretics and false teachers break down the church's fence, by making
   schisms and divisions, make bare her roots, sap the very foundation of
   religion, by corrupting the word of God, and denying the great
   doctrines of the gospel; and hurt her fruit, by disturbing the peace of
   her members, unsettling some, and subverting others. 2. Another
   argument that is made use of to stir them up to diligence in taking the
   foxes, is, because the vines have tender grapes; by vines are meant the
   several distinct congregated churches of Christ; by the tender grapes
   or flowers thereof, we are to understand young converts, whom Christ is
   very tender of, and has a particular regard unto; see Isaiah 40:11 and
   42:3 and these having buts small degree of faith, knowledge, and
   experience, like children, are more easily tossed to and fro, and
   carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slight of men, and
   cunning craftiness of these foxes, whereby they lie in wait to deceive:
   now generally they make their onset upon these, as being more easily
   wrought upon, and by whom they can with more facility compass their
   end; and this being then the case, the ministers of Christ ought to be
   more sedulous and diligent in the discovering of those foxes, from whom
   so much mischief may be expected, and more bold, vigorous, and
   courageous in opposing and rejecting them; seeing the churches of
   Christ are like to sustain so considerable a loss by them, and in
   danger of having a promising vintage spoiled. It is true, the foxes
   love the ripe grapes and devour them, and not when they are, blossoming
   and knotting; which shews Christ's care of his vines, to be the
   greater, that he would have little foxes taken .while the vines were
   blowing; for by such time, as the grapes were ripe, these little foxes
   would be great ones, and would be capable of doing more damage, and not
   so easy to be taken neither; so that the consideration also of there
   being less difficulty now, than there would be hereafter, might animate
   them to set about the work immediately. 3. Christ seems to intimate as
   if they had some interest in these vines; for which reason they ought
   to be the more heartily and vigorously concerned for the welfare of
   them; therefore they are called our vines: it is true, Christ has a
   sole right unto, and property in the vineyard; the vines are all of his
   planting, and the fruit of them belongs to him; yet those to whom the
   vineyard is let out, who are entrusted with the care of the vines, and
   who must give an account of them to the chief and principal owner, have
   also an interest therein; for though our great Solomon must have a
   thousand, whose the vineyard is; yet "those that keep the fruit thereof
   must have two hundred," (Song 8:11, 12), so that if they should be
   negligent in their work, and suffer the foxes to overrun the vineyard,
   and spoil the vines, they would not only incur the displeasure of the
   owner of them, but sustain a loss themselves, by coming short of the
   fruit which otherwise would be distributed to them. Now such arguments
   as these, which have interest and profit contained in them, usually
   have the greatest influence upon persons; Christ: knew this, and
   therefore uses such an one here.

Chapter 2 Verse 16

   My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having given such evidences of his love, and instances of
   his care and kindness to the church in the preceding verses; she, in
   this, declares her faith in him, and signifies the obligations which
   she lay under to observe his commands. "My beloved is mine;" he hath
   given himself to me, his heart is set upon me, and is always careful of
   me, and concerned for me; of which he has given the fullest proofs I
   could wish for: "and I am his;" I give up myself to him, and am at his
   dispose, and think myself obliged to observe whatever he enjoins me;
   and to follow him whethersoever he calls me; especially seeing it is
   for my good; it makes both for my pleasure and profit, as well as for
   his glory; for "he feedeth among the lilies." I need not fear his
   leading me into danger, or any desolate places, but where lilies grow,
   where is all delight and pleasure; he will lead me into green pastures;
   where I may have food, and fullness of it. And,

   First, These words are expressive of the mutual interest and property
   which Christ and the church have in each other; "my beloved is mine,
   and I am his;" he has interest in me, and I have the same in him.

   1st, She says, "my beloved is mine." She first asserts her interest in
   Christi and then his interest in her; for Christ is first ours, and
   then we are his, because he is ours; he loves us before we love him; he
   first gives himself to us, and then we give ourselves to him. But how
   comes Christ to be ours? I answer, 1. By the Father's gift; he gave him
   for us, and he gave him to us; therefore Christ is called (John 4:10),
   "the gift of God." and that by way of eminence; he being the first: and
   best gift, the most comprehensive one, that includes all others in it;
   and brings them with it; for he that gives the greater gift, will give
   the lesser; if he gives his own son, "he will give all things with
   him;" him he has given to be an husband to his church, and a head over
   her; he has given him to be a priest to offer up sacrifice, and to make
   intercession for her; to be a prophet to teach, and a king to rule her;
   and Surely such a gift as this deserves the utmost thanks; so that
   there is reason to say with the apostle (2 Cor. 9:15), "thanks be to
   God for his unspeakable gift; and thus Christ becomes ours. 2. By his
   own gift; he has given himself to us; as well as for us; he gave
   himself a sacrifice for us, and that as an instance of his love to us,
   as well as a fruit of his having given himself in covenant to us
   before. 3. By marriage! Christ has not only espoused our cause, but has
   also espoused our persons; and betrothed us to himself "in
   righteousness and in judgment., and in loving-kindness, and in mercies,
   and in faithfulness," and that for ever; so that, O astonishing grace!
   he that is our Maker is become our husband. 4. By possession: we have
   him and all things pertaining to life and salvation with him; we have
   him in us as the hope of glory, dwelling in our hearts by faith, living
   there as in his own house and temple, and reigning there by his grace
   and spirit, as in his own palace; and those souls who can experience
   this, may say with the Church, my beloved is mine; I have an interest
   in him; for I am in possession of him. Thus Christ is the church's.
   But,

   2dly, She says also, that she was his; I am his; and that because he is
   mine; Now how come souls to be Christ's? I answer, 1. By the Father's
   gift: he that gives Christ to us, gives us also to Christ; and this he
   did in the everlasting covenant, to be his bride and wife, to be his
   portion and inheritance, and to be kept and preserved by him safe to
   glory. Christ having pitched his love upon us, chose us for his own,
   and asked us of his Father, who granted his request; "thine they were,"
   says Christ (John 17:6), "and thou gavest them me." 2. By purchase: he
   has bought us with a price, and that not with corruptible things, as
   silver and gold, but with his own most precious blood; so that he does,
   as he justly may, claim an interest in us upon this account. 3. By the
   conquest of his grace upon our hearts: he pulls down the. strong-holds
   of our hearts; enters in with his glorious train and retinue of grace,
   dispossesses Satan, dethrones sin, sets up a throne for himself, and
   places his own spirit in the midst of us, which is the grand evidence
   of our being his; "for if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is
   none of his;" from whence it may be inferred, that he that has the
   spirit of Christ, is one of his. 4. By a voluntary surrender of
   ourselves unto him; which cannot be better expressed than it is in
   Isaiah 44. 5. "One shall say, I am the Lord's;" which is the language
   of the church here: "another shall call himself by the name of Jacob;
   "which is the name of Christ's church" "and another shall subscribe
   with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of
   Israel;" and this in New-Testament-language, is called a giving
   themselves to the Lord, and to the church by the will of God; so that
   as Christ is ours by his own consent, we are Christ's by our consent,
   being made a willing people in the day of his power.

   Now from Christ's being ours, it follows, 1. That all he has is ours;
   all his perfections are ours; not that they are communicated to us, for
   that would be to deify us; but they are all engaged for our eternal
   good and welfare; we have the comfort of them: Is he the Almighty? then
   he is able to save us from law, sin, hell and death, and to keep and
   preserve us safe to his kingdom and glory: Is he omnipresent? hence
   saints enjoy his gracious presence, in all places, in all his
   ordinances; he can be with them, when and where he pleases: Is he
   omniscient? He knows their persons, their wants; their enemies, etc.
   and is both able and willing to help them: Is he immutable? Is he
   Jesus? the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever?" they need not then
   fear any variation of his mind, any alteration in his love, nor change
   in their state; and thus all other of his divine perfections serve to
   advance their comfort and happiness. 2. That all he has is theirs; his
   person is theirs, to render them acceptable to God; his blood theirs,
   to cleanse and pardon them; his righteousness theirs, to justify and
   acquit them before God; his fullness theirs, to supply their wants; and
   all covenant-blessings and promises which he has in his hands, are
   theirs. Therefore, 3. It follows, that they can want no good thing; for
   as he has ability to help them, he has a heart to do it, and will not
   withhold any thing that may be needful and proper for them, especially
   seeing they have an indisputable right to and interest in them.

   Moreover, from our being Christ's, it follows, that we are not our own;
   our persons, our time and talents, our gifts and graces, are not our
   own, but his; and therefore we should give up all unto him, and glorify
   him with all: nor are we any others; we are not Satan's, for Christ has
   delivered us as lawful captives out of his hands: nor sin's, for Christ
   has redeemed us from it; nor the world's, for Christ has both chosen
   and called us out of it; and therefore we should serve none but him,
   who has an incontestable right to us, and a sovereign power over us.

   Secondly, These words are expressive of a near union, that there is
   between Christ and his church; these two are one in a conjugal
   relation, as husband and wife are one; my beloved is my husband, and I
   am his wife, and we are both one flesh. Which union is, 1. Personal: it
   is an union of persons, that is to say, the whole person of Christ, as
   God-man, is united to a believer; and the whole person of a believer,
   body and soul, is united to Christ; and by virtue of this union, as the
   souls of the saints shall be receives into everlasting habitations till
   the resurrection-morn, so the bodies of the saints shall be raised from
   their dusty beds, and shall then live with Christ for evermore. 2. It
   as a spiritual union; "he that is joined to the Lord, is one spirit:"
   Christ and his church being one, they have one and the same spirit;
   Christ has it without measure, and the church in measure; and this she
   has as the fruit of her union to Christ, and also as the evidence of
   it. 3. It is a vital union; such an one as is between the vine and
   branches: where the spirit of Christ is given, a principle of life is
   implanted; when souls are engrafted into Christ, they receive life from
   Christ; nay, he lives in them, and maintains this spiritual life by
   fresh communications of life from himself, who is the fountain of it;
   and because he lives, they shall live also; as long as there is life in
   the head, there shall be life in the members; and because there is life
   in the root, the branches shall not wither. 4. It is very mysterious:
   the union of the three persons in one divine essence, and that of two
   natures in Christ's person, are very mysterious; these, without
   controversy, are the great mysteries of godliness: and next to them is
   this union of souls to Christ, which the apostle having spoken of, thus
   says (Eph. 5:32), "This is a great mystery, but I speak of Christ and
   the church;" that is, of the union there is between Christ and the
   church; that it; is an ineffable and unconceivable one, appears from
   its being; compared to the union of the divine persons in the Godhead
   (John 17:11-23). 5. It is an indissoluble one: Christ and the church
   can never be separated; the union-bond can never be broken; and what is
   that? The generality of divines say, that it is the spirit on Christ's
   side, and faith on ours; but neither the spirit nor faith are the bond
   of union, but the fruits and effects of it: the reason why the spirit
   is given, or faith, or any other graces are wrought, is, because the
   soul is already united to Christ. What then is the bond of union? I
   answer, Christ's everlasting love; it is this which is the cement that
   knits and joins souls unto him: What was it that knit and united the
   souls of David and Jonathan together, and made them as if they had been
   but one soul, but love? What is it that knits the saints together? so
   as they appear to be of one heart and one soul, but love? This is the
   bond of union between them; and so it is between Christ and his church;
   and now who or what can separate from this love? This betrothment,
   which was done in loving kindness and in mercies, can never be made
   void; this marriage-knot can never be loosed; this union-bond can never
   be broken; Christ's love is everlasting, unchangeable, and inseparable.

   Now from this union flow, 1. An interest in all he has; he being ours,
   and we his by marriage; all his goods are ours, all the aforementioned
   things are ours. 2. A communication of names the church is called by
   the name of Christ (1 Cor. 12:12; Jer. 23:16 compared with Jer. 33:6),
   and Christ is called by the church's name (Isa. 49:3), which is
   somewhat remarkable; for though it is usual for the wife to take the
   name of the husband, yet not the husband the name of the wife. 3.
   Conformity to Christ: by virtue of this union, the soul receives the
   same spirit that Christ has, and has grace daily communicated from, is
   indulged with transforming views of, and therefore cannot but bear some
   resemblance to him; which will more fully appear in the other world,
   when saints shall be like him, and shall see him as he is. 4. Communion
   and fellowship with him: communion with Christ follows upon union to
   him; because his saints and he are both one, he is not ashamed to call
   them brethren; but takes them into his bosom, indulges them with his
   presence, grants them nearness to and familiarity with him.

   Thirdly, These words are also expressive of the mutual affection,
   delight and complacency, which Christ and his church has in each other:
   it is as if she should say, He is a beloved to me, and I am the same to
   him; he loves me, and I love him; yea, there is no love lost between
   us. He says, that the lines are fallen to him in pleasant places, and
   that he has a goodly heritage: he is well pleased with his portion, and
   I am well pleased with mine: for, "whom have I in heaven but him? and
   there is none upon earth that I desire besides him." He says, that I am
   in his eye "the fairest among women," the greatest beauty in the world,
   and so is he in mine; he is white and ruddy, a complete beauty, "the
   chiefest among ten thousand."

   Fourthly, There is in them a manifest declaration of the assurance of
   that knowledge and faith which she had of her interest in Christ; it
   shews us, mat such a thing is attainable; and, sure I am, next to the
   enjoyment of the heavenly glory, nothing is more desirable; it is a
   mercy not only to have an interest in Christ, but also to know it, to
   be capable Of saying with Thomas, "My Lord and my God;" or with Job, "I
   know that my Redeemer liveth;" or with the apostle Paul, "I know whom I
   have believed;" for this makes much for the comfort of souls. The
   church seems to speak this in the triumph of faith, rejoicing in the
   comfortable views of Christ as her own; and as it were boasting of it,
   excluding all other beloveds, as not worthy of her notice, and as not
   to be mentioned with her beloved.

   Lastly, She tells us, that this beloved of hers was feeding among the
   lilies; "he feedeth among the lilies:" which may be regarded either as
   an apostrophe to him, and may be read thus, "O thou that feedest among
   the lilies!" thou, and thou only art mine, and I am thine: or else,
   these words may be descriptive of his person, and prevent a question
   that might be asked, viz. who her beloved was, that she thus claimed an
   interest in? To which she answers, My beloved is that yonder person you
   see feeding among the lilies; and at the same time also points out to
   us the place where he was, and what he was about: his employment was
   feeding, that is, either feeding himself; which. Christ does, when he
   delights and recreates himself in his gardens, the churches, and among
   his lilies, the saints; observing how their faith grows, and how that
   and all other graces are exercised upon himself: Or else, feeding his
   flock, as R. Sol. Jarchi observes; for as he bears the character of a
   shepherd, so he performs the work of one; "he feeds his flock like a
   shepherd;" see chapter 1:7. The place where he is here said to feed, is
   among the lilies; by which may be meant, either a good, quiet, and
   delightful pasture, as R. Sol. Jarchi glosses it; Christ leads and
   feeds his people in "green pastures, beside the still or quiet waters;"
   and what can be more delightful than to lie down among, or to sit and
   feed where lilies grow? or else, by these lilies may be meant the
   scriptures of truth, the precious promises and comfortable doctrines of
   the gospel; and the ordinances thereof, with which Christ feeds his
   church: or rather, by them may be meant the saints, who are compared
   thereunto, in verse 2. of this chapter. Now it is among these that
   Christ feeds; and therefore do any want to know where Christ feeds, as
   the church did, in chapter 1:7? He feeds among his saints, where they
   are congregated in gospel order, where his lilies grow. It may be
   observed, it is not said, he feedeth on, or feeds his flock. with
   lilies, but among them; for it is remarked [374] that sheep will not
   eat them: or the sense may be, Christ feeds himself, and feeds his
   people, and feeds among them, as if he was crowned with lilies, and
   anointed with the oil of them; as was the custom of the ancients at
   festivals [375] thought to be here alluded to by some, who read the
   words, "that feeds;" that is, feeds, sups in or with lilies, being
   crowned with them, and anointed with the oil of them. The lily is a
   summer flower [376] the winter was now past, verse 11, and so agrees
   with the time when those words were spoken.

Chapter 2 Verse 17

   Until the day break, and the shadows flee away: turn, my beloved,
   and be thou like a roe, or a young hart, upon the mountains of
   Bether.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word former part of these words, "until the day break, and the
   shadows flee away," may stand connected with either part of the
   preceding verse; either with those words, my "beloved is mine, and I
   am, his," [377] which are expressly, as has been observed, of that
   mutual interest, union, communion, satisfaction and delight, which
   Christ and his church have in and with each other; and then the sense
   is, as long as day and night continue, and God's covenant with both
   stands sure, so long will my covenant-interest in, and union to Christ,
   who is my beloved, abide solid and unshaken; I can no more be separated
   from his person, and from his love, than day and night can cease; and
   when they do, I shall be taken up into everlasting and uninterrupted
   communion with him, which is now subject to the same vicissitudes as
   these returning seasons are: or else, they may stand connected with the
   latter part of the preceding verse, "he feedeth among, the lilies,
   until the day break [378] etc. and so are expressive of the continual
   presence of Christ in his church, until his second coming, when the
   everlasting day shall break, and all shadows of darkness flee away;
   till then, as in chapter 4:6 he will be on his mountain of myrrh, and
   hill of frankincense; where he will delight himself with, and feed
   among his saints, until all his elect ones are called by grace, and
   till all his lilies are grown up to their full maturity, when he will
   gather them to himself: though the words may be also considered as
   connected with the latter part of this verse, "turn, my beloved, etc."
   and so they contain a prayer of the church's for Christ's speedy access
   unto her, and continued presence with her, until the day should break,
   and the shadows flee away. In which may be considered,

   I.The favor which she requests of him, which is, 1st, To turn, that is,
   unto her; and this she desires that he would do speedily, and therefore
   says, "be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of
   Bether."

   II.The time unto which she desires this favor might be continued to
   her; and that is, until the day break, upon which the shadows would
   flee away.

   I.The favor which she desires of him is, that he would turn unto her;
   which seems to intimate, as though he was about to leave her; which,
   upon some account or other, she had a suspicion of, therefore
   importunes him to stay With her; and seeing him upon the motion, upon
   the turn, ready to depart, she desires that he would turn again, and
   continue with her: or else it supposes that he was entirely gone, and
   that she was sensible of it; and having a great value for Christ's
   person and presence, desires that he would turn again to her: such a
   petition as this, under a sense of desertion, is frequently put up by
   the psalmist, particularly in Psalm 60:1, and 69:16, 17, and 86:16.
   though the word may be rendered, turn about or surround [379] that is,
   with thy favor and loving kindness; let me always be under thy care and
   protection; be thou a wall of fire round about me; so shall I be safe
   and secure from all enemies, until the glorious and wished for day
   breaks, when I shall be out of fear, as well as out of danger: and this
   favor she desires might be speedily granted to her, and therefore says,
   "be thou like a roe or a young hart;" which are not only loving and
   pleasant, but also swift and nimble creatures. She had experienced
   Christ to be so before, and therefore might the more comfortably hope
   that he would be so to her now: she adds, "upon the mountains of
   Bether;" by which perhaps may be meant Bithron, of which we read in 2
   Samuel 2:29. and was so called, because it wag parted or separated from
   Judea by the river Jordan; though some think it should be read Bethel,
   by a change of a letter; and so the Septuagint read it in verse 9 which
   is there an addition to the Hebrew text; though they here render it,
   o]rh koilwka&gt;twn, the mountains of cavities, that is, such that were
   full of clefts and hollow places; but be they what they will, it is
   certain that they were such places where roes and fawns used to skip
   and run. The words may be very well rendered, the mountains of division
   [380] which, if referred to Christ's first coming in the days of his
   flesh, may regard the ceremonial law, which made and kept up the
   division between Jew and Gentile, was the partition wall between them,
   which was broken down by Christ Jesus: or else, the two people divided
   by it, to whom Christ came, for whom he made peace, to whom he preached
   it, and thereby made both one. But if we refer the words to Christ's
   spiritual coming in a way of special grace to visit his people; then
   these mountains of division, upon which Christ comes, and over which be
   leaps as a roe or a young hart, may be our sins and corruptions, which
   often separate between him and our souls; though, when he is pleased to
   come, they are no obstacles in his way, but are easily surmounted or
   removed by him: but if they be applied to Christ's second coming at the
   day of judgment; these mountains of division may intend the spacious
   heavens, in which Christ shall then appear, which at present interpose
   between him and us, and separate us from the enjoyment of his bodily
   presence; one part or branch of whose awful work then will be, to
   separate the sheep from the goats, But,

   II.How long does she desire to be indulged with this favor of enjoying
   his gracious presence, in the discoveries of himself, and of his love
   unto her, without which she could not live, and therefore desires it
   might be speedily granted to her? and that is, "until the day break,
   and the shadows flee away;" which may be understood, either,

   1st, Of Christ's coming in the flesh, which was the break and dawn of
   the gospel day, until the day break; or, according to the Hebrew text,
   "until the day breathe or blow," [381] and naturalists [382] have
   observed, that upon the sun's rising, art air or wind has been excited;
   so upon the rising of "the sun of righteousness with healing in his
   wings? were raised some fine, cool, gentle, and refreshing breezes of
   divine grace and consolation. Before Christ's coming in the flesh, it
   was night, hot only in the Gentile, but in the Jewish world; there was
   a great deal of darkness, blindness, and ignorance, infidelity,
   sleepiness, and security; but upon the arising of this sun, and
   breaking or breathing of this day, all this was in a great measure
   dispelled, and light, nay a great light, was introduced; for Christ's
   coming was "as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a
   morning without clouds;" he came as the light of the world, and made
   that day, that gospel-day, which, by way of eminency is so often spoken
   of in the Old Testament. when the shadows of the old law fled and
   disappeared: so the law is called "a shadow of good things to come,"
   and that because it was a representation of them; which were no sooner
   come, but this was gone, and, like a. shadow, appeared fleeting and
   transitory; and whilst it continued, was dark and obscure; though there
   was some glimmering of light in it, which led the faith of the Old
   Testament saints to Christ, who was represented by it: but now these
   shadows are gone, Christ the body and substance being come; this middle
   wall of partition is broken down; this hand-writing of ordinances is
   taken away, and the whole Mosaic dispensation and economy is waxen old
   and vanished; there being a disannulling of it, because of the weakness
   and unprofitableness thereof; and a glorious dispensation and bright
   day of gospel grace introduced in the room of it, and all by the
   appearance of Christ in our nature; which was the great thing promised,
   prophesied of, long expected, and earnestly wished for by the Old
   Testament saints, as it was perhaps by the church here. Or else,

   2dly, This may be understood of Christ's second coming to judgment;
   which, as the former, is called that day in the Old Testament by way of
   eminency, as being, that great, glorious and notable day of the Lord,
   so is this an the New; for the former, see Isaiah 11:10 and 25:9 and
   26:1 and 27:1, 2, 13; and for this, see Philippians 1:6, 2 Timothy
   1:12, 1 Thessalonians 5:2, 4. and this as well suits both with the
   Hebrew text, and with the natural philosophy of it, as the former:
   Christ's second coming will be at the evening, both of the world and of
   the gospel dispensation, when "the shadows of the evening are stretched
   out, upon us; at a time when there will be a great deal of darkness and
   ignorance, much want of faith, and a very great sleepiness and
   security, which will seize upon professors as well as upon profane; but
   upon Christ's appearance, a glorious and everlasting day will break,
   the shadows of darkness and ignorance will flee away; we shall know as
   we are known, and see him as he is; not as now, "through a glass
   darkly," but face to face;" all infidelity, doubts and fears, will be
   removed; everlasting joy will be upon our heads; no interposing clouds
   will be between Christ and our souls; but we shall have the everlasting
   enjoyment of him, and uninterrupted communion with him: there will then
   be no need of the sun and moon, of gospel-ordinances: for the glory of
   God will lighten both our persons and the place of our residence, and
   the Jamb: himself will be the light thereof; so shall we ever be in his
   presence, see his face clearly, without any mixture of darkness and
   unbelief, and without any fear of the shadows of the evening returning
   upon us; there will be no more night, but one pure, bright and
   everlasting day. Moreover, naturalists [383] have observed, that the
   wind often blows fresh, and fine breezes of air are raised at the
   sun-setting, as well as at the sun-rising; so that the words, until the
   day blow or breathe, that is, at the cool of the day, when the wind
   blows fresher, and there are gentle breezes of air, which often are in
   the evening; at which time it may be very well supposed that God
   appeared to Adam in the garden after his fall: I say, these words may
   be very well applied to the evening of the world, or second coming of
   Christ; which, though it will be with flames of fire, to take vengeance
   on the wicked, yet to the saints it will be "a time of refreshing from
   the presence of the Lord;" which time is earnestly, wished for by them;
   their desire is, that Christ would be as a roe or young hart to hasten
   it; for, as he says, "I surely come quickly," they return and say,
   "Amen, even so, come Lord Jesus." So some Jewish [384] writers
   interpret these words of the day of judgment, and compare them with
   Malachi 4:1.

   For this chapter an account is given of an adventure of the church in

Chapter 3 Verse 1

   By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth;
   I sought him, but I found him not.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word hence it appears, that the day was not as yet broke, which
   the church had mentioned in the last verse of the preceding chapter;
   but that the night was still upon her, even the night of Jewish
   darkness, when the shadows of the ceremonial law were stretched out
   upon her; yet having some small knowledge of Christ by types and
   prophecies, which had raised in her a desire of knowing more of him, as
   well as filled her with love to him, she sought after him; which at
   present was not attended with success, it not being his will as yet to
   appear to her in that manner she was desirous of: though indeed the
   words may be taken in a more large and comprehensive sense; and may
   represent the state and condition of the church of Christ, and all true
   believers, in all ages of the world, at one time or another: and in
   them may be observed,

   I.The church's case, which was the absence of her beloved.

   II.How she behaved herself under it, or what she did in order to remove
   it; "she sought him." And, 1st, The person Whom she sought is
   described; "him whom my soul loveth." 2dly, The place where she sought
   him is mentioned; "on my bed." 3dly, The time when; "by night." 4thly,
   The success she had in seeking; "but I found him not."

   I.The church's case here appears to be, absence of her beloved; which
   is not only manifest from her seeking of him, though that clearly shews
   that he was absent from her, but also from the time in which she sought
   him, which was by night; for as Christ's presence makes the believers
   day, so his absence makes it night with them; as well as from the place
   where .the sought him, and that is, upon her bed; which shews that she
   was in a sleepy, slothful and secure frame of spirit, which is never
   attended with a lively sense and feeling of Christ's gracious presence.
   Now from this being the church's case, we may observe, 1. That the
   change of a believer's frame is often very sudden; not only their
   frames are changeable, but they are often changed: it was not long
   since that the church was in the banqueting-house with Christ, and
   there had her. fill of love, and was sweetly refreshed with his
   gracious presence: and though she fell into a relapse of dullness and
   sleepiness, yet he in love visits her again, and recovers her out of
   it; insomuch that she became so lively in the exercise of her faith,
   that she could claim her interest in him, and relation to him, and say,
   "My beloved is mine, and I am his;" and yet now she is at a loss for
   him, and knows not where he is; she is grown dull and sleepy, carnal
   and secure, and he withdraws himself from her; so that a believer can
   sometimes say, as the Psalmist did (Ps. 30:7), "Lord, by thy favor thou
   hast made my mountain to stand strong;" and perhaps immediately, nay,
   almost at the very same time complain, "thou didst hide thy face, and I
   was troubled." 2. That Christ absents himself from his own church and
   people; he hides his face from the house of Jacob," from his own flesh
   and blood, from his love, his bride and spouse; which he does both for
   her good; and for the advancement of his glory: though Christ's absence
   is very uncomfortable and disquieting to his people; they cannot tell
   how to bear it, especially when they are sensible of it; for sometimes
   they are not, but are attended with sleepiness, carelessness and
   security; he is gone from them, and they are not aware of it, and
   therefore are unconcerned about it, until such time as they are
   awakened by him; and then they are made sensible that he is withdrawn
   from them: not but that Christ is always present with his church in
   some sense, though they have not always the comfortable sense of it
   upon their souls. 3. That Christ's absence does not dissolve that
   covenant-interest and union which his people have in and with him;
   though there may be a distance as to communion, yet there is a nearness
   as to union; she was his, and he was hers, now as much as ever, though
   absent.; from her; neither did it destroy that love and affection which
   she had in her heart towards him; for still it is "him whom her soul
   loveth," though she could not see him nor hear of him.

   II.What the church did in this case, comes next to be considered: she
   sought him; which shews that she was sensible that he was gone from
   her. Believers are sometimes, like Samson, they wist or know "not that
   the Lord is departed from" them; but it seems that the church was
   apprised of it; perhaps she had slept quietly for some time, imagining
   that her beloved was with her, but finding herself mistaken, seeks for
   him: and from hence it also appears, that she saw her need of Christ's
   presence, had a value for it, and was in hopes of enjoying it again,
   otherwise she would never have sought for him. Now Christ's presence,
   when lost, should be sought after; 1. Timely, or "while he may be
   found," as Isaiah says, chapter 55:6 for otherwise, by missing an
   opportunity, as Thomas did, he may be gone, as he was in chap, 5:6 when
   the church opened to him. 2. With our whole hearts; not feignedly or
   hypocritically, as some did, of whom complaint is made in Isaiah 58:2,
   nor with worldly ends and views; not for loaves, as some of Christ's
   followers did. 3. Fervently, and not in a careless and negligent
   manner; as it may be the church did here, and therefore did not
   immediately succeed. 4. With care, diligence and constancy, until he is
   found, as the church did afterwards, in verses 2, 3, 4. 5. In proper
   places, as well as at proper times; as in the church of Christ, and in
   the public ordinances of the gospel, as well as privately in the
   closet, by prayer, meditation and reading; and such seekers as these
   are most likely to meet with success. But it will be proper to consider
   move particularly the seeking of Christ here; where may be observed.

   1st, The description of the person whom she sought; "him whom her soul
   loved:" which shews not only the reality and sincerity of her love to
   Christ, whom she loved "with all her heart and soul, as appears from
   her retaining an affection for him, even when in the worst of frames,
   and when he was departed from her; for nothing could separate her from
   the love of Christ; all the waters of afflictions, temptations,
   desertions, etc. could not extinguish that flame of love that was
   kindled in her soul: I say, it not only shews the heartiness and
   reality of her love to Christ, but also that she sought him from a
   principle of love, and not with sinister ends and views; she sought him
   because she loved him, and she loved him "because he first loved her;"
   and this is an indication that she was not wholly forsaken by him;
   seeing this grace of love was in her soul, and maintained there by a
   secret and invisible hand, nay, brought into act and exercise an some
   measure.

   2dly, The place where she sought him is also mentioned, and that is, on
   her bed: by which we are not to understand the temple, nor the church
   of Christ, and the public ordinance; thereof; for had she sought there,
   she had sought aright; besides, these seem to be intended in the
   following verse, by "the streets and broad places" of the city this bed
   is distinguished both from that mentioned in chapter 1:16. and also
   from that in chapter 3:7; in the former of which places it is called
   our bed," Christ having a joint property in it; and in the latter it is
   said to be his bed, Christ being the only maker and principal owner of
   it: but this bed is said to be hers," by night on my bed;" which was
   purely her own, and where she was without the presence of Christ, who
   was justly displeased with her for being there: moreover a different
   word is here used than what is in either of those places. Some [385] by
   it understand the bed of contemplation"; the bed being a proper place,
   as; the night is a proper time, to have the thoughts composed in
   meditation (see Ps. 4:4); but it seems rather to intend a bed of
   affliction, sorrow, and tribulation, which she was cast into, in which
   she sought the. Lord, as it is usual with persons in such a condition
   (see Rev. 2:22, Hosea 5:15). Though I should choose to-understand it of
   a bed of carnal ease and security, upon which she was fallen; and seems
   to be expressive of the manner in which she sought him, which was in a
   cold, lazy, lukewarm and formal way, rather than of the place where.

   3dly, The time when she sought him, and that is, "by night;" which
   shews, that it was either a time of great affliction with her; or else,
   of darkness and desertion; this is manifest enough; as also, that she
   was very uneasy and restless in her present condition, being brought in
   some measure to a sense of it; and that she had an exceeding great love
   for Christ, seeing, that at a time When others were taking their rest,
   she was seeking for him. In the Hebrew text the word is in the plural
   number, and may be rendered, by nights; [386] that it is one night
   after another successively, "I sought him;" but to no purpose; and so
   it may be expressive of her diligence and constancy in seeking, as well
   as of her condition when she sought.

   4thly, The success she met with is here related, "I found him not;"
   either, because she did not seek him aright, as James says, chapter
   4:3, "Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask amiss;" so she sought and
   found not, because she sought amiss, in a cold and lifeless way and
   manner; Christ would not be found in such a way of seeking: or else it
   was the will of Christ to be absent for a time, and not manifest
   himself upon first seeking; not for want of love to her, nor because he
   was regardless of her, but to exercise her grace, try her faith and
   patience, and to make her more earnest and diligent in her search: as
   also that she might prize him the more when she had him, as well as be
   more careful to retain him; which had the desired effect upon her, as
   appears from verse 4.

Chapter 3 Verse 2

   I will rise now, and go about the city, in the streets, and in the
   broad ways; I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him,
   but I found him not.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church, finding that the former methods she had taken were
   not attended with success, consults others, being sensible that she was
   wrong before, which she resolves to pursue without any more delay. In
   these words we have,

   I.The church's resolution, which consists of three parts: 1st, To "rise
   now," immediately. 2dly, To "go about the city." 3dly, To seek Christ
   in the streets and broad ways" thereof.

   II.Her performance of this resolution; "I sought him."

   III.Her success in it, which was as before; "but I found him not."

   I.Here is the resolution of the church, to take other methods than what
   she had done before, in order to find her absent beloved; which shews,
   not only that she was sensible that she had taken some wrong ones
   before; and that no good was to be obtained that war, for Christ would
   not be found in such a Way of seeking him as upon the bed; but also,
   that her former disappointment had not discouraged her from pursuing
   her search of him; nay, it had made her more lively and active, zealous
   and vigorous in it, as appears from this new resolution of hers, and
   her putting it into practice; which consists of the three following
   things.

   1st, She resolves now to rise, that is, from her bed of sloth and
   carnal ease, and to appear more vigorous; and that now, without any
   more delay; for resolutions are not to be breathed upon; no time should
   be allowed them but the present; we should immediately proceed to the
   performance of them, otherwise flesh and blood, which are too often
   consulted in such cases, will find many ways to elude them; but these,
   as they are not to be made in our own strength, so neither are we to
   expect the performance of them by it; but, however, the church
   resolving to quit her bed, and forego her own carnal ease and pleasure
   in search of Christ, and that she might enjoy his presence and company,
   not only shews the exceeding greatness of her love to him, and the
   reality and sincerity of it, but also the uneasiness of her soul, and
   the distress of mind she was in; she could not be easy and contented
   without him, and therefore resolves to seek until she found him.

   2dly, She not only resolves to rise, and that directly, but also to "go
   about the city." Her design in rising, was not to seek him in a
   superficial manner, but search the city, the streets thereof, and thus
   seek him whom her soul loved. By city is here meant the church of God,
   which is frequently called so in scripture (see Ps. 87:3; Heb. 12:22,
   23), and no doubt but here is a regard had to the city of Jerusalem, by
   which name the church often goes, and to which it is frequently
   compared in scripture; but why it is so, will be shewn on chapter 6:4,
   and therefore I shall only at present shew in what sense and for what
   reasons the church may be said to be a city, which are as follows: 1.
   Cities being large and populous, and having in them great and spacious
   buildings, are generally built where there is a good foundation: the
   church of God is a city that is well founded; for "the Lord himself
   hath founded Zion, and the foundation which he has laid there is a sure
   one; and that is Christ himself, who is able to support the whole
   building, and will never fail; for he is that rock upon which his
   church being built, "the gates of hell cannot prevail against it." 2.
   Cities are commonly delight, fully situated, upon an eminence, in a
   good air, and by a pleasant river: the church of God is "beautiful for
   situation;" it stands upon rising ground; this" mountain of the Lord's
   house is established upon the top of the mountains;" it is in a good
   air, and is comfortably fanned with the gentle and refreshing breezes
   of the blessed Spirit; it is situated by a pleasant river, even the
   river of God's boundless love and grace: "the streams whereof make glad
   this city of our God." 3. In cities are usually fine, large, and
   magnificent buildings: the ,church is God's architecture; it is of his
   building, and therefore must needs be well built; every believer is a
   temple, and that a temple of the, Holy Ghost's; there is a great deal
   of glory, beauty, and excellency in these buildings, as well as
   strength and firmness (see Isa. 54:11, 12; Rev. 21:10, 11, 12, 18, 21).
   4. Cities are very populous and numerous; there are a great many
   inhabitants in them; so is the church of God: it is true, it is called
   but a little flock, when compared with the world, but yet, considered
   by itself, it is very large and numerous; John saw at once, after he
   had beheld the forty and four thousand, "a great multitude, which no
   man could number," and that of such who belonged to Christ, and were
   saved by him; and so will the church, even on earth, appear very
   numerous, when those prophecies are fulfilled, which you may read in
   Isaiah 49:19, 20 and Isaiah 60:4-8. 5. In cities; as there are large
   numbers of inhabitants, so there is a diversity of them, as rich and
   poor, good and bad: in Christ's church here on earth, there is a very
   great difference of its members; some have greater gifts, and more
   grace than others have; some are more public-spirited than others, and
   so of greater usefulness; some are real and hearty believers, others
   are only painted hypocrites; for there has been always tares among
   Christ's wheat, wolves and goats among his sheep, and some who have had
   a name and place in this city, whose names were never "written among
   the living in Jerusalem." 6. In well regulated cities there is a good
   order and decorum kept; there are good laws made, and proper officers
   appointed to put them in execution; as well as a good watch and guard
   provided for the security of the inhabitants: in the church of God,
   there are good and wholesome laws enacted by the great legislator,
   which concern the admission of persona into this city, their behavior
   whilst in it, and their removal from it, if disagreeable; and these are
   preferable to all others, not only because God is the author of them,
   but also, because they are written upon the hearts of all those who are
   true citizens, according to that promise (Jer. 31:33), "I will put my
   law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts:" moreover,
   here are proper officers appointed, such as ministers of the gospel,
   who are to see that these laws are carefully observed and exactly
   complied with; who also bear the character of watchmen in the next
   verse, being set as well for the defense of the church, as to give
   direction and instruction to her. 7. In cities there are peculiar
   privileges which belong to the citizens thereof; and so there are in
   the church of God:-all, who are Christ's freemen, and are "fellow
   citizens of the saints, have a right to all the ordinances of the
   gospel, to all the privileges and immunities of Christ's house: they
   shall never be arrested by justice, nor be brought into a state of
   condemnation; nor is it possible for them ever to lose their freedom.

   Now her "going about the city," is, (1.) Expressive of her diligence
   and industry in seeking Christ; she lost no opportunity; she sought in
   all other places, as well as in the open streets, wherever she thought
   he might be found, or there was any probability of hearing of high.
   (2.) It shews the pains she took, as well as the diligence she used in
   seeking; for it must be very" painful and laborious to go round about
   or all over a city, especially a large one, such an one as Jerusalem
   was, to which the allusion is here made; her search was as sorrowful
   and as fatiguing, as that of Joseph and Mary, who, after three days
   search, in their company, among their kindred, and about the city, at
   length found Christ in the temple: but all this toil and labor she
   regarded not, so she could but find him whom her soul loved. (3.) This
   being done in the night, which was an unseasonable time to walk about
   the city in, especially for women, is a farther indication of the
   strength of her affection to him, in that she did not value the
   reproach that might attend her. (4.) She not only ran the risk of
   reproach and scandal, but also of danger and mischief, which the
   night-season exposed her to; and which she experienced in chapter 5:7,
   but being fired with love and fearless of danger [387] she puts all to
   the hazard, regarding no inconveniencies that might ensue; for her
   heart was so set upon finding Christ, that she was resolved to try all
   ways, whatever she suffered in the experiment.

   3dly, She resolves to seek "him in the streets and broad ways;" where
   we have, 1. The person whom she was resolved to seek described, him
   "whom my soul loveth;" which is the character she gives of him in the
   former verse; and shews that her love to him was still the same, was
   not abated, though she had been disappointed of finding him; nay, that
   it was rather increased, and therefore she repeats this over and over,
   as not knowing how to speak of him any other way: 2. The particular
   places in the city, where she resolved to seek him, "in the streets and
   in the broad ways;" by which we are not to understand places [388]
   where worldly business is transacted, and to which crowds of people
   flock for the same purpose, as the court, the market-place, or the
   exchange; for Christ is not to be found there; worldly employments,
   especially when, immoderately pursued, rather draw souls from him than
   bring them near to him: nor are the books, writings, and tenets [389]
   of the Gentile philosophers here intended; for she could not expect to
   find him there, where he was never known or heard of: but by them we
   are to understand, either the Jewish synagogues, where .prayer was wont
   to be made, and the word of God preached, there being a probability of
   finding him there; or rather, the public ordinances of the gospel,
   which are the streets and broad ways of this city," the church, in
   which Christ walks, and often shews himself to his people; and in
   seeking him here, she sought aright; though, for reasons hereafter to
   be mentioned, she did not meet with immediate success. But these
   phrases may in general intend the diligence and exquisiteness of her
   search, as in Jeremiah 5:1. So some cities are described as having
   broad ways in them, as Troy [390]

   II.She gives an account of her performance of this resolution; "I
   sought him," says she: she not only resolved upon it, but also did it;
   nay, she no sooner said it, but likewise did it. Resolutions, without
   putting, them in practice, avail little; and unless they are made in
   the strength of Christ, and are performed by the same, are never
   performed, neither aright, nor to any good purpose; but this of hers
   was quickly performed; she was soon enabled to set about it, being
   assisted by divine grace, and not left to consult with "flesh and
   blood."

   III.Her success is also mentioned by her, "but I found him not:" which
   she seems to take notice of with much sorrow and concern; that though
   she had such an earnest desire after, so strong an affection for, and
   had been so diligent in her search of him, had spared no pains, and had
   run all risks of losing her good name, and of being exposed to danger,
   and yet he would not shew himself to her; she could not get sight of,
   nor hear any tidings concerning him; and this still shews that strong
   was her love; for had she not dearly loved him, she would not have been
   so much concerned at her disappointment in not finding him. And now
   this was, 1. To chastise her for her former negligence in duty, and for
   her indulging herself in carnal ease and security; for he seems
   resolved, that as she had lost him through her ease, she should not
   find him without "trouble;" for we are not to suppose that he resented
   her present way of seeking, nor her present behavior to him, which
   seems very agreeable; but this he does to shew how much he was
   affronted with her former carriage. 2. To exercise her faith, and try
   her patience: thus when the apostle Paul (2 Cor. 12:8, 9) was sorely
   buffeted by Satan, he "besought the Lord thrice that he might depart
   from him;" but all the answer he could for the present obtain, was, "my
   grace is sufficient for thee." 3. To shew that even means themselves,
   though they are to be used, are not to be depended on; these cannot
   help souls to a sight of Christ, unless he is pleased in them to reveal
   himself; for, "when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?" yet
   nevertheless, they are to be carefully observed and diligently used by
   us.

Chapter 3 Verse 3

   The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said,
   Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church continues to give an account of her adventure, and
   what befell her when in the streets and broad ways of the city; as how
   she was found by the watchmen, whose business is to take up and examine
   persons that they meet with in the night; of whom she inquires after
   her lost spouse, but for the present can have no tidings of him. In
   these words we shall, I.Inquire who are meant by "the watchmen,"

   II.What by their "finding" of her.

   III.Consider the question proposed by her to them; "Saw ye him whom my
   soul loveth?"

   IV.Shew why no answer is mentioned, as returned to this question.

   I.It will be proper to inquire who are meant by the watchmen here: and
   by them we are not to understand angels, as some; [391] though these
   are thought to be called watchers, in Daniel 4:13, 17 and are the
   saints' life-guards, attend upon their persons, watch over them, and
   encamp about them: nor the princes and great men of the world, who have
   the care and government of kingdoms, provinces and cities; but are
   ignorant of Christ, and know not the "Lord of glory," as others: [392]
   nor false teachers [393] who are called, Isaiah 56:10 "blind watchmen,
   dumb dogs that cannot bark:" but rather, the true ministers of the
   Gospel; the prophets under the Old Testament, and the apostles and
   faithful teachers under the New, who frequently bear the title of
   watchmen in Scripture (see Isa. 52:8, 62:6; Ezek. 33:7). The Jewish
   writers [394] interpret these words of Moses and Aaron with the
   Levites, who kept the watch of the tabernacle. The ministers of the
   Gospel are called watchmen, either in allusion to shepherds, who watch
   over their flock by night (Luke 2:8) or else, to watchmen in cities, as
   here; and their work may be considered,

   1. With regard to themselves: they are to watch over themselves as well
   as others; they are to watch over their Conversations, that they be as
   become the Gospel they preach, and so that they may give no ill
   examples to others, nor cause the ways and doctrines of Christ to be
   evil spoken of, and render their ministry useless; they are to watch
   over their doctrines, and take heed that they be agreeable to the
   oracles of God; that they deliver nothing but the "wholesome words of
   Christ Jesus," and such as may be for the edifying of their hearers,
   and suitable to the cases of souls; they are to watch all opportunities
   to preach this gospel, as the apostle says (2 Tim. 4:2) to, "be instant
   in season and out of season;" and then they are to watch and observe
   the success of it, and how it is blessed and made useful to souls:
   moreover, they ought to have a very great guard upon themselves; for if
   the enemy can but surprise, decoy or corrupt them, it turns much to his
   advantage. Now ministers of the Gospel should take heed to themselves,
   lest they fall asleep, or grow careless and indifferent in the work of
   the Lord; or are diverted from it through the frowns or flatteries of
   the world; or be corrupted with errors and false doctrines; for these
   things tend much to the ruin of Christ's kingdom and interest.

   2. With regard to others, their work is, 1. To give the time of night,
   as in Isaiah 21:11, 12. the question is put, "Watchman, what of the
   night? Watchman, what of the night?" the answer is, "the morning
   cometh, and also the night." Sometimes it is night with the church; she
   is fallen asleep upon a bed of security: the wise virgins sleep as well
   as the foolish; it is then the work of ministers to give the time of
   the night, to. apprize the church what a condition she is in, and to
   endeavor to awake her out of it: though sometimes the ministers, the
   watchmen, are asleep, as well as the churches, and know not what time
   of the night it is, which is a dreadful case; and then are the churches
   of Christ in a poor plight and condition indeed. 2. Their work is to
   give notice of approaching danger; they are to give notice of the
   danger that sinners are in, who ate walking in the broad road to
   destruction; and also the danger that churches may be in through errors
   and heresies springing up among them, as well as by indulging
   themselves in any vicious practices, which they are severely to check
   and reprehend. Now this work requires vigilance, prudence, courage and
   faithfulness; and also shews the necessity and usefulness of the public
   ministry, which can no more be dispensed with than watchmen in a city;
   and likewise what care the Lord has of his churches, in placing such
   officers in them, as well as the awfulness of the work they are
   concerned in; for if the watchman does not discharge his duty, the
   blood of those he has to do with will be required of him. These
   watchmen are farther described by their "going about the city:" by the
   city, we are to understand the church of God, as in the former verse:
   and their "going about" it, is mentioned to distinguish them from those
   that were upon the walls, who kept their stands, and did not stir from
   their places; and also to shew their proper work and business, which,
   as it appears from hence, they are diligent in; and so it proves them
   to be true watchmen and faithful ministers of the Gospel, who, in
   imitation of Christ their Lord and master, go about doing good to the
   souls of men.

   II.Being thus in the discharge of their duty, and using diligence
   therein, they found the church; which is the next thing to be inquired
   into: they found me; that is, they fell upon the subject of my case and
   condition, in their sermons, and exactly took notice of and spoke to my
   case, as if somebody had told them of it beforehand, and as if they had
   particularly designed me above all the rest of their audience; which
   shews the power of the word, and its piercing and penetrating nature;
   it often finds out particular sinners in a congregation, and points out
   their particular sins unto them; it searches into the inward recesses
   of their hearts, brings secret sins to light, sets them in order before
   them, and brings them to an open and ingenuous confession of them;
   likewise it finds and points, out the particular cases of believers,
   oftentimes tin-known to the minister, and unlooked for by the believer,
   which seems to be the church's case here. It is amazing how this is
   sometimes effected; insomuch that some have thought that some friend or
   other, to whom they have communicated, their cases, have told the
   minister, and he has purposely treated on such a subject to meet with
   them; though when they have more narrowly inquired into it, have found
   it otherwise, to their great surprise; nay, sometimes a minister, by
   stepping out of the way, going off from his subject, and making a
   digression, has met with souls, and hit their case, as Austin did with
   the Manichee. God has given many instances of the secret energy of the
   word, and the mighty power and grace of the Spirit, in applying it to
   the different cases of persons. But,

   III.Having met with something under the ministry of the word suitable
   to her case, she is encouraged to take her opportunity, after public
   worship was over, to speak privately to the ministers, and propose this
   question to them: "Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?" in which may be
   observed, 1. The person concerning whom she inquires, and that is, him
   whom her soul loveth. Christ is still the subject of her discourse and
   inquiry; whether she talks with ministers or private Christians, she is
   upon the search after him; and though she cannot as yet find him, she
   is not discouraged from seeking; nor is her love and affection towards
   him abated, though she cannot see him. 2. The manner in which she
   proposes this question, and that is very abrupt; for, without giving
   them an opportunity to speak to her first, or using any preface to
   excuse her freedom with them, she immediately puts the question, as
   soon as she came up to them, "Saw ye him," etc. where it may also be
   observed, as has been already on chapter 1. 2. that She uses the
   relative him without an antecedent, and does not express the person's
   name whom she inquires about; which shews the singular excellency of
   Christ, that he was to her the only him in the world; and likewise the
   singular esteem she had for him, the strength of her affection to him,
   how much her thoughts were upon him, and her desires after him;
   insomuch that she thought every body must know whom she meant, and whom
   she loved, without mentioning his name; and more especially it
   supposes, that she concluded that these, ministers knew whom she meant.
   3. Her putting this question to them, shews, (1.) That she had a value
   for them, had entertained a good opinion of them, and judged them
   proper persons to apply to; which might arise from what she had met
   with under their public ministry. (2.) That she was unwilling to let
   any opportunity slip, in which there was any likelihood of finding
   Christ; therefore she will not only hear the ministers publicly, but
   converse with them privately; and such a practice is highly commendable
   in, and to be imitated by all the saints; oftentimes much is lost by
   missing an opportunity: What did Thomas lose by not being; with the
   rest of the disciples when Christ appeared to them? Why, a sight of
   Christ; and not only so, but also fell into a fit of unbelief. (3.)
   That when persons apply to ministers, they should keep close to their
   own souls cases, as the church does here, and not trouble them with
   long and tedious discourses, filled up with invectives against their
   fellow Christians, and animadversions upon their weaknesses and
   imperfections; but their chief concern should be the ease of their own
   souls; and the subject of their discourse, Christ and his grace. (4.)
   That ministers had need to be well acquainted with the various cases of
   souls, that they may know how to speak aptly to them, and communicate a
   word in season to their refreshment; which, when fitly spoken, is like
   apples of gold in pictures of silver But,

   IV.Here is no answer returned to this question, that is here recorded;
   the reason of which is, not because they could not give one; nor were
   those blind watchmen, which were without the light of faith and
   experience themselves; those dumb dogs which cannot bark, and know not
   how to speak to the cases of souls, being unacquainted with them, of
   which we read in Isaiah 56:10 nor, it may be, was it because they did
   not return an answer, though she has not recorded it; and if they did
   not, it might be owing to her overhaste in not waiting for one; or if
   they did, yet she not being able to apply it with comfort to her own
   soul, takes no notice of it; and this might be, to let her see the need
   of a divine blessing upon means, and the power and grace of the blessed
   Spirit to attend them: but yet, though she did not find immediate
   comfort and relief, she might get something from them, which was
   afterwards useful to her as seems to appear from the following verse;
   for oftentimes the Spirit of God brings to our remembrance, and sets
   home, with power upon our souls, things which have been dropped in the
   ministry of the word, or in private conversation, which were of no use
   in the hearing of them.

Chapter 3 Verse 4

   It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom
   my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had
   brought him unto my mother's house, and into the chamber of her
   that conceived me.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having sought about the city, in the streets and
   broad ways of it, for her beloved, and made inquiry of the watchmen
   concerning him, though attended with little success; yet is not
   discouraged, but keeps on seeking, till at length she finds him; which
   not only filled her with a transport of joy, but also puts her upon
   using all the means she could to continue him with her, and secure his
   presence and company for the future. In these words are,

   I.An account of the church's finding Christ; "I found him whom my soul
   loveth."

   II.The place or time, where or when she found him; "It was but a little
   that I passed from them, but I found," etc.

   III.Her behavior towards him; "I held him," &c.

   I.The church gives an account of her finding Christ; "I found him,"
   etc. She had sought, but not in vain; that promise was made good to
   her, seek, and ye shall find;" which was also when all means failed:
   she had sought him privately, by prayer and meditation; and publicly,
   by an attendance upon the ordinances of the gospel: she had heard the
   ministers of Christ preach, and had conferred with them alone, and yet
   could not find her beloved; which may inform us, 1. That means, though
   they are to be used, yet not to be depended on; they will not avail
   without a divine blessing: Bethesda's pool must be moved by an angel,
   or no cure can be performed; the Spirit of God must move upon the
   waters, the ordinances, or they will not convey light and life to
   souls; Paul may plant, and Apollos may water, but it is God only that
   giveth the in, crease: the most comfortable doctrines and" precious
   promises of the gospel, opened and delivered in the most powerful
   manner, will not be useful without the special energy of the Spirit. 2.
   That we should not be discouraged when all means fail; because he is
   found sometimes when they do so, as he was by the church here;
   therefore when, with Job 23:8-10 we have gone backward and forward, on
   the right hand and on the left, and yet cannot behold him; we should
   with him rest contented, and say, he knoweth the way that I take,
   though I do not know which way he has taken and when he hath tried me,
   I shall come forth as gold. 3. This shews us, that unless Christ shew
   himself, there is no finding him; for, "when he hideth his face, who
   can behold him?" 4. Finding Christ, when all means fail, gives the
   greatest discovery of Christ's love and grace, the freeness and
   sovereignty of it; and makes it appear, that it does not depend upon
   our will or works, but upon his sovereign good will and pleasure. 5.
   Finding Christ after so many disappointments, must needs be joyful and
   welcome; she seems to speak it with an air of pleasure, and in an
   exulting manner, as those disciples did, who said, John 1:41, "we have
   found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ;" for his
   long absence from her, and the fatigue she had endured in seeking of
   him, did but serve the more to endear and sweeten his presence to her.

   II.She declares where or when she found him; "it was but; a little that
   I had passed from them:" that is, either it was but a little space of
   time, as R. Aben Ezra observes; or I, had got but a very little way ere
   I found him. She is said to pass from the ministers, not out of
   disrespect unto them, for she had an entire value for them; nor because
   she had received no benefit from them, for they had hit her case,
   though she had not present enjoyment of Christ; nor was it because she
   was above ministers and ordinances, for these will continue in the
   church, and are to be used by believers until the second coming of
   Christ: but this passing from them shews, that she did not rest here;
   that though she applied herself to ministers, and made use of
   ordinances, yet she did not forget Christ, but looked beyond all these
   to him; and went a little farther than she had done before, in the
   lively exercise of her faith upon him: also her meeting with Christ,
   when she had a little passed them, shews, that Christ is not far from
   his ministers and ordinances; for he has promised to be with them unto
   the end of the world: and therefore there is a very great encouragement
   for souls to attend unto them, not only from that promise, but also
   from the church's experience, here recorded by her.

   III.Her behavior to him is next mentioned, 1st, She "held him fast, and
   would not let him go." 2dly, Brought him into her mother's house, and
   into the chamber of her that conceived her."

   1st, As soon as she saw him, she laid hold on him, and cleaved so close
   to him, that he could not stir a step from her; which, on her part, is
   expressive, 1. Of her faith in him: it is the nature of faith to lay
   hold on Christ; the actings of it are frequently expressed by it (see
   Prov. 3:18; Heb. 6:18); the believer lays hold on Christ as his savior;
   on his righteousness, and pleads it as his justifying righteousness
   before God; on Christ, as God's strength, to do all for him and in him;
   and on the covenant which is in Christ's hands, with all the blessings
   and promises of it, and appropriates them to himself (Isa. 27:5, 56:4).
   2. Of her love and affection to him; and therefore she grasps him in
   her arms, will not let go her hold of him, nor suffer him to stir from
   her; but, could she have her will, would have him always in her sight;
   and, as Ruth said, chapter 1:16, to Naomi, where he goes, she is
   resolved to go; where he lodges, she will lodge; his people shall be
   her people, and his God her God; so pleased was she with him, so dearly
   did she love him. 3. Of her fears and jealousies lest he should remove
   from her: she knew the bitterness of Christ's absence, as well as had
   had experience of the sweetness of his presence, and therefore dreaded
   parting again; was afraid of every thing that had a tendency to it, and
   therefore gives that solemn charge she does in the. following verse. 4.
   Of her steadiness and resolution to hold him, whatever was the
   consequence; though she might be reproached. and persecuted for it,
   suffer the loss of her good name, and every thing else that was
   valuable in this worm; yet Christ to her was worth more than ten
   thousand worlds; nothing could tempt her to part with him.

   Moreover, on his part, these words are expressive, (1.) Of a seeming
   offer or desire to depart; such an one as the angel who wrestled with
   Jacob made, when he said, "let me go, for the day breaketh," (Gen.
   32:26). which, as it made him, so it made her cleave the closer to him,
   wrestle the more with him, and keep faster hold of him. (2.) Of a
   gracious allowance which he had granted her; to lay hold on him: it is
   a surprising instance of his grace, that such vile, sinful creatures as
   we, should be suffered to come so near his person; O astonishing grace!
   that such should be invited to come, and should be welcome to lay hold
   on Christ and his righteousness, and not incur the crime of rudeness
   nor presumption. (3.) Of his wonderful condescension, to be held by a
   creature, and that a sinful one: it was not because she was stronger
   than Christ, that she held him and would not let him go, but because he
   condescended to let it be so; for she received the strength from him,
   by which she held him: it shews indeed the great power and strength of
   faith; thus to hold Christ; but then she had it all from him, who is
   the object of it. (4.) Of that delight and pleasure he took in the
   exercise of her faith upon him: as it does not argue weakness in him to
   be held by her, so neither does it unwillingness; he was no more held
   against his will, than he was by a superior force; he was held by her
   because it was both his will, and well-pleasing to him; "without faith
   it is impossible to please God," or Christ; in the exercise of it they
   are much delighted, and are well pleased to be held as it were by it.

   2dly, The other part of her behavior towards him, is, that she brought
   him into her mother's house, and into the most private and retired part
   of it, even into the chamber of her that conceived her; and this is
   indeed what she principally had in view in holding of him. The allusion
   is to the tents and apartments women had in former times, distinct from
   their husbands (Gen. 24:67, 31:33). By her mother's house and chamber,
   the Targum understands the school that was kept in the chambers of
   Moses and Joshua, where the children of Israel studied the law; R. Sol.
   Jarchi interprets them of the tabernacle in Shiloh; as does R. Aben
   Ezra of the ark of the testimony. Some [395] think that by her mother's
   house, is meant the temple; and by the chamber the holy of holies,
   which was accessible to none but the high-priest: though Brightman
   thinks, that both these phrases are expressive of Christ's incarnation,
   which the church was importunately desirous of, which may be expressed
   by her mother's house, and the chamber of her that conceived her;
   because in becoming incarnate, he was a partaker of the same flesh and
   blood with her; and she may be said to bring him into it, because it
   was for her sake that he assumed human nature. But I think it should
   rather be understood either of the visible church, which is the mother
   of all believers; see Galatians 4:26 in which many souls are born again
   through the ministry of the word, and are nursed, and nourished up with
   the words of faith and good doctrine, with the sincere milk of
   gospel-truths, and the refreshing breasts of gospel ordinances; and
   Christ may be said to be brought in here, when his name is publicly
   professed in the congregation of his saints, his gospel asserted and
   vindicated, and his ordinances submitted to; when the mighty instances
   of his grace to his people are made known, and united praises upon that
   account are offered up unto him: and this no doubt the church had in
   view in introducing him here, that she, and others with her, might
   magnify the Lord together, for all the special instances of his
   kindness to her, and that they" might in having fellowship one with
   another, in the house of God, have intimate fellowship with the Father
   and with the Son: or else, by her mother's house, may be meant her
   heart, where the incorruptible seed of divine grace was cast, and where
   the new creature was conceived, born and brought up; and where it grows
   until it becomes a perfect man, and arrives to the measure of the
   stature of the fullness of Christ: and by the chamber of her that
   conceived her, the inmost recesses thereof; there she desired to bring
   him, that he might dwell there by faith; that he might live in her, and
   she in him, and so have intimate and uninterrupted communion with him;
   which is the purport and design of the solemn charge which is given to
   the daughters of Jerusalem in the following verse.

Chapter 3 Verse 5

   I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the
   hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he
   please.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are either the words of Christ [396] adjuring the daughters
   of Jerusalem, young converts, who were the virgins, the companions of
   his bride, to give his church no disturbance, nor awake her, who was
   his love, before she pleased; for the church was now taking sweet
   repose, being weary and fatigued with running after and searching for
   him till she found him; it is therefore the will of Christ, that now
   she be not disturbed: or else, they are the words of the church which
   is the more commonly received sense; who knew how to prize Christ's
   presence, having experienced a long absence, and had been at a great
   deal of pains and trouble to find him, and now having obtained her much
   wished for and long-desired end, she is not willing to part with him;
   but as she had had much trouble to find him, is willing to use some
   care and diligence to keep him: and being fearful lest these young
   converts should by any unbecoming word or action provoke him to depart,
   she gives this solemn charge; which is the same with that in chapter
   2:7 where it is more largely explained. The Targum understands it as
   the charge of Moses to the people of Israel, not to go up into the land
   of Canaan, until the term of forty years was expired.

Chapter 3 Verse 6

   Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness, like pillars of smoke,
   perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders of the
   merchant?
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word of the Jewish writers [397] think, that these are the words
   of the nations of the earth, wondering at the coming of the Israelites
   out of the wilderness, before whom the Lord went in a pillar of cloud
   by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, which appearance was very
   surprising to them. Though they are rather, as some [398] think, the
   words of the Jews, wondering at John the Baptist and his ministry, of
   whom all men mused in their hearts whether he was the Christ or not and
   therefore the Jews dispatched messengers to him, to know the truth of
   it: his first appearance was in the wilderness of Judea, which
   fulfilled an ancient prophecy concerning him, "the voice of him that
   crieth in the wilderness;" hither great numbers, like pillars of smoke,
   flocked to him, to attend upon his ministry and baptism: he was a
   burning and shining light in his day there was a great deal of zeal,
   warmth and fervency in his preaching; for which work he was
   extraordinarily fitted, being richly perfumed with those gifts and
   graces of the Spirit, which are comparable to myrrh, frankincense, and
   all powders of the merchant. Others [399] take them to be the words of
   the Jewish church, wondering at the large number of converts appearing
   in the beauties of holiness, in the Gentile world, which before was
   like to a dry heath or a barren wilderness (see Isa. 49:21, 60:8)
   though others [400] think Christ himself is here introduced, admiring
   the beauty of his church, and the graces of his own spirit in her. But
   I am rather of opinion, that they are the words of the daughters of
   Jerusalem, who, upon this happy meeting of Christ and his church, saw a
   greater glory and a more excellent beauty in her, than ever they had
   done before "and especially, it must not be supposed, that the angels
   [401] are here speaking and admiring the church's beauty, seeing these
   bear no part in this song; much less the church herself [402] for this
   no way suits with that modesty and humility which always appear in her:
   but it very well agrees with the daughters of Jerusalem, to whom so
   solemn a charge is given in the former verse, which excited and stirred
   them up to take a fuller view of her; and the more they looked upon
   her, the more they wondered at her; and in expressing it, thus highly
   commend her, which they do,

   I.By describing her as "coming out of the wilderness."

   II.By comparing her ascent from thence to "pillars of smoke."

   III.By saying that she was "perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with
   all powders of the merchant."

   I.They commend her, by describing her as coming out of the wilderness.
   By the wilderness, out of which she is said to come, may be meant,
   either,

   1st, A state of nature, which all the elect of God are in before
   conversion; out of which, by mighty and efficacious grace, they are
   brought. Now this may be called a wilderness, 1. Because of the
   barrenness and unfruitfulness of persons in such an estate: a
   wilderness is a dry and barren place (see Ps. 107:35; Zeph. 2:13), and
   so are the hearts even of God's own people before conversion; and
   therefore are called "dry, parched and thirsty ground," (Isa. 35:7,
   44:3) which is only moistened, watered, and made fruitful by the
   effusion of God's Spirit, and the flows of his love and grace: whilst
   in a state of nature, they are like the barren heath or fallow ground,
   until they become God's husbandry, being broken up, manured, and made
   good ground, so as to bring forth fruit to his glory. 2. Because a
   wilderness is full of perplexed ways; a man that is in it is often at a
   loss, and knows not which way to take: and as bewildered is a man in a
   state of nature; he is a stranger to the way of peace, life and
   salvation, by Jesus Christ; there are many by-ways present themselves
   to him, which he is ready to imagine are the right; as his civility,
   morality, legal righteousness, and external profession of religion;
   which tracks he follows, if religiously inclined; if not, he pursues
   the paths of open sin and profaneness; and so he goes on, not knowing
   whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes; he is in
   a wilderness, and so he continues, until the Spirit of God guides his
   feet into the way of peace. 3. Because of the want of provisions
   therein; see Psalm 78:19, a man that is in a state of nature, has no
   spiritual provisions; no heavenly food, no divine refreshments; there
   is no bread of life here, only husks, which swine do eat; therefore
   souls that are in such an estate, are in a starving and famishing
   condition; hence it is called a "pits wherein is no water," (Zech.
   9:11). 4. Because of the danger thereof: in a wilderness, there is not
   only danger of losing one's way, and falling into holes and pits, but
   also of being devoured by wild beasts; a state of nature is certainly a
   dangerous one; the wrath of God abides upon such that are in it;
   destruction and misery are written upon all the ways of sin; these have
   a tendency to bring souls thereunto, which they inevitably will, if
   grace prevents not. Now, in this state and condition God finds his
   people, when he calls them by his grace, as he did Israel of old; of
   whom it is said, Deuteronomy 32:10, "he found him in a desert land, and
   in the waste howling wilderness: "but he does not leave his people"
   here, he brings them out of it; which is an instance of his
   distinguishing and surprising grace, of which the church here was made
   a partaker; and therefore the daughters, in a way of admiration at it,
   say, "Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness!" which is
   expressed in the present tense, because of the incompleteness and
   imperfection of the work of grace in this life; which, though it is at
   present unfinished, yet is continued and carried on, and will be
   performed unto the day of Jesus Christ. Or else,

   2dly, By the wilderness, out of which the church is said to come, may
   be meant this world; so the nations of the world may be, and
   particularly the land of Babylon, into which the Jews were carried
   captive, is called the wilderness of the people, in Ezekiel 20:35. And
   now this world may very well be so ca lied; and especially the passage
   of God's children thro" it, may be compared to the passage of the
   Israelites through the wilderness of Egypt, 1. Because of the roughness
   of the way, the children of God, in their passage through it, as the
   Israelites did, meet with many difficulties, trials and afflictions; in
   this world they must have tribulation, and thro" a variety of it, "must
   enter into the kingdom of God;" for the way to heaven is, oJdov
   teqlimmh&gt;nh an afflicted way, or a way strewed with afflictions. 2.
   Because of the many pits, traps, and snares, that are in it: this world
   is full of them, every thing in it is of an ensnaring nature to God's
   children; therefore "let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he
   fall." 3. Because of the many venomous creatures and beasts of prey
   which are in it; and therefore the wilderness, through which the
   Israelites traveled, is called, Deuteronomy 8:15. "the great and
   terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions; to
   which the ungodly men of this world may be compared, for their
   poisonous and infectious practices, their serpentine cunning, spite,
   venom, and cruel malice, among whom the saints are obliged to be whilst
   in this wilderness. 4. Because of the frequent want of provision, and
   the method of supplies in it the Israelites, whilst in the wilderness,
   were often in want of food, and sometimes reduced to such extremity,
   that they thought it almost impossible to have relief, and therefore
   said (Ps. 78:19), "God furnish a table in the wilderness?" but yet,
   notwithstanding these seeming impossibilities and their frequent
   murmurings and complaints against him, he was pleased to give them meat
   to the full: so in this wilderness of the world, which yields of itself
   no suitable provision to God's children, they are supplied with food,
   and that in such a way, as the world knows nothing of; God feeds them
   with the bread of life, and gives them to eat of the hidden manna, the
   food of the wilderness; he refreshes their souls with his grace and
   presence, affords them spiritual nourishment from gospel doctrines,
   promises, and ordinances, and withholds no good thing that as proper
   for them. 5. As the Israelites, through a great many windings and
   turnings came safe to Canaan's land, and were led by a right way,
   though not a direct one, but often backwards and forwards, to the city
   of their habitation; so the people of God, through various turns of
   providence, and many trials and- afflictions, are led thro" the
   wilderness of this world, but yet always in a right way; in a way that
   makes most for God's glory, and their own good, and shall all be
   brought safe to the city of habitation and place of rest, Which God has
   prepared for them. Now the church is said to be coming out of this
   wilderness. Saints, though they are in the world, yet they are not of
   it, being chosen and called out of it; and then may they be said to be
   coming out of it, when they not only profess not to belong to it, but
   do openly withdraw from, and quit the company and conversation of the
   men of it; when their affections are so weaned from it, as that they
   can readily forsake, and cheerfully suffer the loss of all things in
   it, for the sake of Christ. Moreover, when neither the frowns nor
   flatteries of the world can draw them aside from Christ and his gospel;
   but, regardless of either, are breathing and longing after another and
   better world than this: and when this is the case of souls, as perhaps
   it was of the church here, they have made a good progress towards
   coming out of this wilderness. Or else,

   3dly, By it may be meant a state of sorrow and distress, which the
   people of God are often in, in this life, but are sooner or later
   brought out of it. God sometimes brings them into the wilderness, into
   a distressed, and disconsolate condition, being without his presence,
   and the discoveries of his love and grace; where having no views of
   Christ, and their interest in him, they are bewildered in their souls,
   and scarce know where they are, nor whither they are going; but he will
   not leave them. so, long, but will bring them out of it, and speak
   comfortably to them. Now in such a bewildered state and condition the
   church had been, not knowing where her beloved was, which caused her to
   run up and down, here and there, like a person in a wood, seeking for
   him, and calling after him; but now she is represented as coming out of
   this state, having gotten some glimpse of him, and enjoying some
   communion with him. But,

   II.She is not only described by her coming out of the wilderness, but
   also this ascent of hers from thence is said to be like pillars of
   smoke; which seems to be expressive of the motions of her desires and
   affections towards Christ; and shews, 1. That her affections towards
   Christ were afresh kind., led; either by the fire of the Spirit, which
   was applied unto her; see Matthew 3:11 or of the divine word, which is
   compared thereunto, Jeremiah 23:29 which powerfully wrought upon her;
   or else, by the presence of Christ, which sometimes causes the hearts
   of his people to burn within them; this she now enjoyed, which stirred
   up her affections the more unto him: now these being said to be "like
   pillars of smoke," intend the first appearances of them; for as soon as
   ever the fire takes, there will be smoke, and often in great abundance;
   for which reason the first appearance of grace in young converts is
   compared to "smoking flax," (Isa. 42:3, 2). That her affections were
   heavenly, and rising upwards, "like pillars of smoke;" they were not
   set upon things on earth, but upon things in heaven, and especially
   upon Christ, who is there;. and particularly upon her person, blood,
   and righteousness; all which take much with the believer's affections,
   and are exceeding precious to him. 3. Her affections towards Christ,
   being compared to pillars of smoke, shew the uprightness of them; that
   they went up to him like pillars in a straight line, and did not bend
   either this way or that: and it may be observed, that the word
   translated pillars, signifies palm-trees [403] or pillars arising up in
   the form of palm-trees; which grow very upright, even though very great
   pressures and weights be laid upon them; and therefore the righteous
   are compared unto, and said to grow up like them, in Psalm 92:12. 4.
   The steadiness and constancy of her affections to Christ may be
   represented hereby; which can by no means be diverted from him; neither
   by the winds of temptations, nor by the tempests of afflictions, nor by
   the blasts of persecutions; though it is true, pillars of smoke are by
   every wind easily turned this way or that: but perhaps the allusion is
   here made unto the smoke, which ascended daily from the altar of
   burnt-offering; and, if we will believe the Jews, this smoke could
   never be dispersed, nor bent by any wind; for, among the ten wonders
   which were seen in the temple, these are mentioned [404] viz. That the
   rain never extinguished the fire of the wood, which was laid in order
   upon the altar; nor did the wind ever conquer the pillar of smoke, so
   as to disperse it, nor bend it in this way or that. 5. This may also
   represent the offering up of herself as a whole burnt-offering to the
   Lord, as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which was
   but her reasonable service (see Rom. 12:1). Or, 6. It may set forth the
   obscure state and condition of the church in this world, by reason of
   outward crosses and afflictions which are such as hide her inward glory
   and beauty from the men of the world; for though she is separated from
   the world, and is coming out of it, yet she looks like pillars of
   smoke, dark, and cloudy, but little brightness or glory appearing in
   her to them.

   III.She is also said to be perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with
   all powders of the merchant.

   1st, She is said to be "perfumed with myrrh;" which may be understood,
   either of Christ himself, who is as "a bundle of myrrh" unto his
   people, exceeding grateful, to them; and which renders them acceptable
   to God, being held in the hand, or carried in the bosom of faith: or
   else, of his death, which, though like myrrh, exceeding bitter to
   himself, yet is of a sweet-smelling savor to his Father, and a
   delightful perfume to believers: or else, of his righteousness; which
   is that garment of Christ's, which, whether considered as in himself,
   or as put upon his people, smells of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;" and
   with which they being clothed, "their smell is as the smell of a field
   which the Lord hath blessed."

   2dly, She is said to be also perfumed, with frankincense;" by which may
   be meant the mediation and intercession of Christ, which is that much
   incense, with which Christ offers up the prayers of all saints to his
   Father; and with which their persons and their prayers being perfumed,
   they meet with acceptance with God, which otherwise would be a stink in
   his nostrils (see Rev. 8:3, 4; Ps. 141:2).

   3dly, She is said to be perfumed, or to be possessed with all powders
   of the merchant." Christ is this merchant-man; the graces of the Spirit
   are those powders which Christ, as mediator, is full of; all which are
   sweet and savory, rich and costly; "the merchandise of them is better
   than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold."
   Some read this last part of the words thus [405] "which is above or
   more excellent than all powders of the merchant, druggist or
   apothecary; [406] for no spice in the merchant's warehouse, no precious
   drug or aromatic powder in the apothecary's shop, is to be compared
   with those graces of the Spirit, which Christ bestows upon his own
   people.

Chapter 3 Verse 7

   Behold his bed, which is Solomon's: threescore valiant men are about
   it,
   of the valiant of Israel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are either the words of the daughters of Jerusalem
   continued, as some [407] think; who having begun, go on to commend the
   church from that communion and fellowship she enjoys with Christ, and
   from that safety and security which she has in him: or rather,
   according to others [408] they are the words of the church; who
   perceiving that the daughters of Jerusalem were much taken with her
   beauty; and fearing, lest they should ascribe too much to her, to the
   prejudice of her beloved; she breaks in upon them, and proposes a far
   more glorious object to them to gaze upon and wonder at, even Christ,
   from whom she received all her beauty and glory; him she describes by
   his bed, and the guard about it, in this and the following verse; by
   the chariot he rides in; in verses 9, 10. and by the royal crown he
   wore on his coronation day, in verse 11. In these words we have,

   I.To consider who is meant by Solomon.

   II.What by his bed.

   III.The guard that is about it, which is here described.

   IV.Why a behold is prefixed to all this.

   I.It will be proper to consider who is meant by Solomon and I apprehend
   we are not to understand this literally of Solomon, the son of David,
   and king of Israel; but mystically, of Christ, who was typified by him;
   it may be said of this place, what our Lord said in another case, that
   a "greater than Solomon is here;" Solomon was undoubtedly an eminent
   type of Christ; the whole seventy-second psalm, which is entitled, A
   Psalm for Solomon," is generally expounded, not only by Christian, but
   also by Jewish interpreters [409] of the Messiah, whom Solomon
   prefigured; and there is an agree-merit and likeness between them in
   the following things: 1. They were both the sons of David: Christ, as
   well as Solomon, was so according to the flesh; God promised that the
   would raise up the Messiah from his seed, which promise he accordingly
   made good: the Jews lived in the expectation of him, as being to spring
   from him; and therefore when Christ put that question to them, "What
   think ye of Christ? whose son is he?" they readily answer, "The son of
   David" hence he is called both the root and offspring of David;" as he
   is God, he is thereof of David; and as he is man, he is his offspring.
   2. They were both the sons of God; see 2 Samuel 7:14 compared with
   Hebrews 1:5 only with this difference; Solomon was the son of God by
   adopting grace; Christ, by nature and eternal generation. 3. They were
   both Jedidiah's, beloved of God: that Solomon was so, is manifest from
   2 Samuel 12:24, 25 and therefore had that name given unto him; that
   Christ is the dear son of God's love, was testified by a voice from
   heaven more than once, particularly at his baptism, and at his
   transfiguration upon the mount (see Matthew 3:17, 17:5). 4. They were
   both kings and preachers in Jerusalem; for Solomon (see Eccl. 1:1-12)
   and of Christ it is manifest that here he exercised great part of his
   public ministry; and here also did he sit upon the throne of his father
   David, though in a spiritual way. 5. He was a type of Christ in his
   wisdom: It is said of him (1 Kings 4:30, 31) that his "wisdom excelled
   the wisdom of all the children of the east-country, and all the wisdom
   of Egypt; for he was wiser than all men:" and of Christ it is said
   (Col. 2:3) that "in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge;" he as much, nay, infinitely more exceeded Solomon in
   wisdom, than he did all other men; for never man spake such words of
   wisdom, his enemies themselves being witnesses, as he did. 6. He was
   also a type of Christ in the largeness of his kingdom: as God gave him
   "largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore;" so he
   likewise gave him a kingdom suitable to its. and made him to reign
   "over all kingdoms, from the river unto the land of the Philistines:"
   Christ's kingdom, however small it may appear now, shall in the latter
   day be very large; for "he shall have dominion from sea to seas and
   from the river unto the ends of the earth; for when he takes to himself
   his great power, and reigns, "the kingdoms of this world shall become
   the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ;" (see Ps. 72:8; Rev. 11:15,
   17). 7. He prefigured him in the peaceableness, as welt as in the
   largeness of his kingdom: Solomon's kingdom was a peaceable one, as
   well as a large one; "he had peace on all sides round about him;" and
   his subjects "dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his
   fig-tree, all his days:" which was all typical of Christ and his
   kingdom; one of whose titles is, "the prince of peace;" whose scepter
   is "the gospel of peace;" whose kingdom is not "meat and drink, but
   righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost;" and whose subjects
   are "the sons of peace;" on whom he bestows peace of conscience now,
   and will introduce them into an everlasting peace hereafter. 8. He was
   also a type of him in the riches of his kingdom: there was such plenty
   of gold in the days of Solomon, "that silver was nothing accounted of,"
   but was as common "in Jerusalem as stones;" Christ's "riches are
   unsearchable;" he has riches of grace, and riches of glory, which he
   bestows upon his subjects, so that they are all as kings and princes:
   it may be much more truly said of all Christ's subjects, what the king
   of Assyria in a boasting manner said of his princes, "Are not my
   princes altogether kings?" all the subjects of Christ's kingdom are
   princes, and all these princes kings; and therefore it must needs be a
   very rich and opulent one. 9. Solomon was a type of Christ likewise in
   his marriage of Pharaoh's daughter, an Egyptian woman; one that was an"
   alien from the commonwealth of Israel, and a stranger from the covenant
   of promise;" which is not more surprising, nor indeed so much, as that
   "the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth," should espouse to
   himself such poor, mean, vile, and sinful creatures, as we by nature
   are; so that he who is our Maker, is also our husband; astonishing!
   stupendous grace! 10. He was a type of him in his building the temple,
   which prefigured the church of Christ which is built on Christ, "the
   rock, the foundation, and corner-stone; in whom all the building, fitly
   framed. together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:" nay, it is
   not only built upon him, but it is also built by him, therefore to him
   all the glory should be ascribed; for "he shall build the temple of the
   Lord, and he shall bear the glory," Zechariah 6:13. And now seeing that
   Solomon was a type of Christ in so many instances, it need not be
   wondered at, that he should bear his name in this, and in some other
   parts of this Song. But,

   II.The next thing to be enquired into, is, what is meant by his bed;
   and there is a variety of opinions concerning it.

   The Targum understands by it, the temple: R. Sol. Jarchi, the
   tabernacle of the congregation; in both which the priests" and Levites
   watched and kept guard: R. Alshech, the congregation of Israel. Some
   [410] think that the temple of Christ's body is here intended, in which
   "the fullness of the Godhead dwells;" and which was guarded and
   protected from the fury and malice of Herod and others, by angels, who
   were continually ascending and descending on him: others [411] the
   hearts Of believers, in which Christ condescends to dwell; which are
   kept by his power, and guarded by that "peace of his which passeth all
   understanding. Some [412] have been of opinion, that Christ himself is
   this bed: others [413] that it is his cross: and others [414] that the
   happiness of the saints in glory is here meant; who, dying in the Lord,
   "enter into peace, and rest in their beds;" which are those mansions
   that are prepared and reserved for them in heaven. Though others [415]
   think that the scriptures are this bed; in hearing and reading of
   which, souls are often begotten again; they are written for the comfort
   of God's children, being opened, are made very useful to them, where
   they frequently meet with Christ, and have communion with him: these,
   notwithstanding the cunning and malice of wicked men, have been safely
   kept and strangely preserved by the providence of God; as the doctrines
   of them have been strenuously maintained and defended against heretics
   by the ministers of the gospel. But I am rather inclined to think, that
   by this bed, we are to understand the church of Christ:" [416] it is
   here Christ dwells; this is his resting-place; here souls are begotten
   and born again; and here he grants to his people nearness of access
   unto him, sweet familiarity, and delightful fellowship with him. Now
   this may he said to be his bed, because the Father has given it to him,
   and he has purchased it with his own blood; as also, because it is of
   his own making. But,

   III.We now proceed to consider the guard about this bed; which are
   either the angels of God [417] who are ministering spirits to the
   church, and "encamp round about them that fear the Lord; who, as they
   are always ready, so they are able and mighty to do the pleasure of
   Christ, and to defend his church; who are as valiant and courageous in
   doing their master's work and will, as they are faithful and trusty: or
   rather, by this guard about the. church, we are to understand the
   ministers of the gospel; [418] who, "by night stand in the house of the
   Lord," and act the part of watchmen there; defend the truths of the
   gospel, and vindicate the cause of Christ against all opposers. These
   are described,

   1st, By their number, threescore; which perhaps was just the number of
   guards which Solomon had every night about his bed; and that not only
   for the safety and security of his royal person, but as an indication
   of his majesty and greatness: and it may be observed, that these are
   just double the number of David's worthies, Solomon excelling his
   father in glory and majesty; though perhaps here is a certain number
   mentioned for an uncertain, which may be particularly mentioned,
   because it is a competent and sufficient one.

   2dly, By their qualifications, "valiant or mighty men:" they are such
   who are strong in Christ, in his grace, and in the power of his might;
   and so indeed they had need to be, to discharge the work they are
   called unto: they are capable of digesting the word of God themselves,
   and of dividing it to others; they have courage enough to defend the
   gospel against all its enemies, and are "valiant for the truth upon
   earth;" they quit themselves like men, being strong; and stand fast in
   one spirit, striving together for the faith of the gospel."

   3dly, By their original, or descent, they are "the valiant of Israel:"
   the Israelites were noted for valiant men, and were a terror to their
   enemies; and these were the choicest, the very flower of them; these
   were Israelites indeed, who had something of the spirit of old Israel
   in them; who, as a prince, had power both with God and men, and
   prevailed.

   4thly, By their posture; they stood round about the bed, on all sides:
   which shews not only their diligence in their work, and how careful
   they were that nothing might prejudice the church, nor disturb its rest
   and repose; but also the safety and security of it: not that this is
   all the security the church has; for besides the angels, and these
   ministers of the gospel, who attend it, the Lord himself is round about
   it; "for as the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so is the Lord
   round about his people, but yet it is a great mercy and blessing that
   the Lord is pleased to set such a guard as this about his bed, or set
   such watchmen as these upon the walls of his Jerusalem.

   IV.To all this a behold is prefixed; which may be considered, either as
   a note of attention, to stir up the minds of the daughters of Jerusalem
   to consider this great person, whose bed this is which is guarded after
   such a manner as is here represented; from whence they might conclude,
   that if his bed was so stately, his person must be much more so: or
   else, as a note of admiration, which she takes up, not only to shew how
   much she was affected with the glory and greatness of Christ's person,
   and with those privileges which she enjoyed through, and by him; as
   that she should be in his bed, where he condescended to grant her
   communion with himself, about which so strong a guard is set as is here
   described: but likewise, she does it to stir up the affections of these
   daughters towards Christ, that they might be filled with desires after
   him, and not be at rest until they also had some enjoyment of him, in
   whose presence she had found so much sweetness.

Chapter 3 Verse 8

   They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his
   sword upon his thigh, because of fear in the night.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words is a farther description of the guard about
   Christ's bed: and that

   I.By their armor; they "all hold swords."

   II.By their skillfulness in using them; being "expert in war."

   III.By their readiness to engage upon any occasion; "every man hath his
   sword upon his thigh."

   IV.The reason of this guard, and their being thus armed, and standing
   in this posture, is also assigned; because "of fear in the night."

   I.Here is a farther description of the guard about Christ's bed, by the
   armor which they appeared with; they "all hold swords:" they are not
   only mighty and valiant men, men of courage "but also armed men;" and
   therefore are more capable to act both defensively and offensively. Now
   by the sword, which they hold in their hands, or have girt upon their
   thighs, is meant the word of God, which in scripture is called, 1. "The
   sword of the spirit," (Eph. 6:17) and that because it is a spiritual
   one; for as none of "the weapons of our warfare are carnal," but
   spiritual; so likewise is this, which is no small part of our Christian
   armor; and which none but "the spiritual man" does, or can use to any
   good purpose against spiritual wickednesses in high places;" as also
   because it is made by the Spirit of God; he is the author of it; it is
   he that furnishes us with it, and makes it powerful and efficacious to
   answer the ends for which it is both made and used. 2. It is called a
   sharp one, nay, said to be (Heb. 4:12), "sharper than any two edged
   sword;" which sinners have found to be true, by those sharp
   threatenings and severe reproofs it has given for sin; and those
   cutting convictions, which, in the Spirit's hand, it has laid them
   under for it; for then it pricks the very heart and conscience, and
   pierces, "even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit;" it cuts and
   hews persons down, that are either going on in a course of profaneness,
   or are vainly boasting of their own righteousness; nay, it not only
   cuts, but kills, according to Hosea 6:5, compared with verse 4:
   "therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the
   words of my mouth:" Satan has often felt the keenness of this sword,
   especially as it was in the hand of Christ, and managed by him against
   him in the wilderness; who repelled every temptation of his, with a
   "for it is written:" neither is there any weapon more powerful and
   successful in the hand of faith, when strengthened by the Spirit of
   God, to resist that enemy of our souls, than this is; nor is there any
   that is more formidable to him, nor more dreaded by him. Moreover it
   has appeared, and has been sufficiently tried to be a sharp sword in
   the refutation of errors and heresies; it has at once cut the nerves
   and sinews of sophistic arguments, and laid open naked truth to public
   view; and will still appear more evidently so in the destruction of
   Antichrist, that man of sin, "whom the Lord will consume with the
   spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his coming." 3.
   It is also called a two-edged one; Christ is represented (Rev. 1:16) as
   having such an one proceeding out of his mouth; and the saints, in
   Psalm 149:6 as having the like in their hands; in both which places I
   am inclined to think, that the word of God is intended, whose two edges
   are the law and gospel. The law is one of those sharp edges of the word
   of God, which, in the hands of the Spirit, makes piercing and cutting
   work in the heart of a poor sinner; it lays open not only the gross
   enormities of life, but also the vile corruptions of nature, and
   discovers the wrath of God, which is the due desert thereof; it not
   only accuses and convicts, but also curses and condemns; nay, becomes a
   killing letter, so that the poor sinner, under the powerful workings of
   it, is in his own apprehension a dead man: this sharp and cutting work
   of the law, the apostle Paul went under; this keen and sharp edge of
   the word of God he sufficiently felt, as is manifest from Romans
   7:9-11. Moreover, the gospel is the other edge of this sword; and a
   sharp one it is, in the Spirit's hand, to cut down both the best and
   worst in man; it cuts down the best in man, his goodness and
   goodliness, his strength and wisdom, his righteousness and best
   performances, and lays them all aside in the business of his
   justification before God, and acceptance with him: it also cuts down
   the worst of man; it gives the greatest blow at his sins and
   corruptions of any thing else, and teaches him the most powerfully to
   deny Ungodliness and worldly lusts; it puts him upon an abasing of
   himself, and a magnifying of the grace of God. Now this sword, the
   guard about Christ's bed had in their hands, and upon their thighs, to
   defend it from all the dangers it was liable to: and though in our
   bibles it is rendered swords, in the plural number; yet in the Hebrew
   text it is in the singular number, the sword; [419] for it is but one
   sword, which is the word of God, that these persons were acquainted
   with; and firmly held for the safety and protection of the church.

   And now, by their holding this sword, is meant, not only their
   acquaintance with the word of God, and their apprehension of it, but
   also their retention of, and firm adherence to it: they not only held
   it forth to others, but also held it fast themselves; which is a
   necessary qualification in the ministers of the gospel, or in those who
   are about Christ's bed; for having this sword always in their hands,
   they are in a readiness to "war a good warfare;" which they are not
   strangers to, as appears from the following character of them. For,

   II.They are farther described by their skillfulness in military
   affairs, "being expert in war:" these had been in God's gumna&gt;sion,
   or school of exercise, where they had been in some good measure taught,
   and versed in" the art of war, and had their, spiritual senses
   exercised to discern between good and evil." The ministers of the
   gospel are, in common with other Christians, engaged in a war with sin,
   Satan, and the world; but being endowed with greater light and
   knowledge, faith and experience, as they must be supposed to have a
   greater degree of courage to oppose; so they must be allowed to have a
   greater expertness in managing a war with those spiritual enemies, than
   usually private believers have; having a large knowledge of, and
   acquaintance with the many windings and turnings of a deceitful and
   treacherous heart, as well as the depths of Satan, and the cunning and
   crafty wiles and methods he takes to deceive souls; as also the
   various, charming, and alluring baits of an ensnaring world: and
   besides all this, being set a in higher post and place in the church,
   it is highly necessary that they should be more expert in fighting "the
   good fight of faith," against all opposers of the doctrines of the
   gospel; for it is not only proper that they should be mighty men, men
   of courage, who are concerned in such a work; but also men of
   skillfulness, who know how to use those spiritual weapons which they
   are accoutered with; so as both the truth of the gospel shall be
   defended and established, and error and heresy be refuted and
   overthrown.

   III.They are also described by the posture of readiness which they are
   to engage upon any occasion; "every man hath his sword upon his thigh:"
   to have the sword upon the thigh, is a preparation for war, and an
   indication of readiness to engage in it; see Psalm 45:3 for being
   there, it is near unto them; they can come at it on all proper
   occasions, and are hereby in a posture of defense. All this may be
   expressive of that familiar acquaintance which ministers of the gospel
   have with the word of God, and how near it is unto them? it is in their
   mouths and in their hearts; it dwells richly in their hearts, with
   which they meditate upon it; and it is in their mouths in the preaching
   of it; they can quickly and easily come at it, and furnish themselves
   with sufficient proofs of gospel-truths, and with proper arguments for
   the refutation of erroneous doctrines; so that as they are set for the
   defense of the gospel," they are always in a posture of readiness to
   act for it.

   IV.The reason of this guard about Christ's bed, and of their being thus
   armed and standing, in this posture, is here assigned; which is,
   "because of fear in the night:" which some understand of that dread and
   terror which is injected into the minds of men by evil spirits; and so
   the Targum explains this, as it does also the terror by night, in Psalm
   91:5 of apparitions and evil spirits which walk in the night; which
   those who have the seal of circumcision in the flesh, which the
   paraphrast supposes is meant by the sword upon the thigh," have no
   reason to be afraid of: but it is much better, in the Talmud [420]
   understood of the fear of hell, which is comparable to the night;
   though that fear, which believers are apt to be possessed of in their
   times of darkness, seems rather to be intended: and from hence may be
   observed, 1. That believers have their nights of affliction,
   temptation, desertion, darkness, sleepiness, and carnal security. 2.
   That they are often possessed with fears in such seasons; as "without
   are fightings," so "within are fears;" as that Christ is not theirs;
   that they shall never get to heaven, nor hold out to the end; and are
   frequently terrified with the formidable posse their enemies bring
   against them, to which they find their own power and strength unequal;
   and therefore are ready to faint, and be discouraged; and their peace,
   rest, and quietness in Christ, are much disturbed. 3. That Christ has
   provided a guard for his church, to remove those fears, support them
   under those discouragements, and defend them from those who would make
   inroads upon their faith and comfort; and these are the ministers of
   the gospel, whom he has set upon the walls of Zion, and placed about
   his bed, the church; that so the out-works and fortifications of gospel
   doctrines may be kept firm against all opposition without, and the
   precious promises of the gospel may be open and dispensed within; that
   so her peace and comfort may not be broken in upon; which, as it shews
   the safety and security of the church, so it does likewise the tender
   care and concern of Christ for her.

Chapter 3 Verse 9

   King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having described Christ's bed, proceeds to give some
   account of his chariot, which he had made for himself and spouse. The
   word here translated chariot, is to be found in no other part of the
   scripture, and is differently rendered. Some translate it a throne,
   which Solomon had prepared for himself; so Junius and Tremellius:
   others, a stately palace or bride chamber, which he had built on
   purpose for the more honorable reception of his bride; so David de
   Pomis, R. Sol. Jarchi, and Arias Montanus: others, a bed; which is so
   called from the fruitfulness thereof, which in chapter 1:16. is said to
   be green; but then it must mean such a bed, in which the bride used to
   be carried, as R. David Kimchi [421] observes. So that it seems to
   signify the nuptial bed, or an open chariot, or some such like thing,
   in which the bride was carried in pomp to the bridegroom's house: and
   in this sense is the word used in the Misnah; [422] where mention is
   made of a decree "that the bride should not go out into the city,
   zwyrpab beappirion, the word here used, "in the nuptial bed or open
   chariot;" in which as R. Sol. Jarchi says, in his gloss upon the words,
   "they carried her from the house of her father to the house of her
   husband." And so the Septuagint here renders the word by forei~on,
   which signifies something in which persons or things are carried, and
   is very much like in sound to the Hebrew word; and some [423] have
   thought that it is this very Greek word which is here made use of,
   which might not be unknown to the Hebrews; and zwyrpa twnbl is a usual
   phrase with the Rabbins, to express the celebration of marriage. [424]
   It seems to be the nuptial chariot; in which according to Pausanias;
   [425] three only were carried; the bride, who sat in the middle, the
   bridegroom on one hand, and the friend of the bridegroom on the other:
   something of this kind is the Palki or Palanquin of the Indians; in
   which the bride and bridegroom are carried on the day of marriage on
   four men's shoulders. [426] By this chariot, R. Sol. Jarchi and Alshech
   would have the tabernacle of the congregation understood; though the
   Targum and R. Aben Ezra understand it of the temple, which was made of
   the cedars of Lebanon: but by it rather is meant, either,

   First, The human nature of Christ, in which, as in a chariot, Christ
   made himself visible and conspicuous to men, and gave a glorious
   display of his greatness and majesty; "for in him dwelleth all the
   fullness of the Godhead bodily;" it was in this he descended from and
   ascended up to heaven; and by which saints have access to God, and a
   communication of grace from him; for our way of access to God, and of
   acceptance with him, as well as of conveyance of all covenant-grace and
   blessings from him, is "consecrated for us through the veil, that is to
   say, Christ's flesh:" Concerning which chariot of Christ's human
   nature, we may observe, 1. The author, king Solomon, Christ himself:
   and this serves to set forth the magnificence of it; for if at is the
   work of so great a person, it must needs be curiously wrought; and at
   the same time it shews his wonderful humility and condescension, in
   that one who was possessed of royal dignity, should be employed in such
   a work; and in nothing did he give a greater instance of it, than in
   the assumption of human nature, in his being found in fashion as a
   mall: which work is purely ascribed to himself; it was sine virili
   opere, Without the help of man that Christ became man; his human nature
   is the stone cut out of the mountain without hands," and the tabernacle
   which God pitched, and not man; and because of this, it is wondrous and
   surprising: when it was first prophesied of, it is ushered in with a
   "behold a virgin shall conceive, etc." and when the news was brought to
   the virgin herself, it was startling and astonishing to her, and made
   her say, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?" but this being a
   work of God, with whom nothing is impossible, was effected by him: but
   though Christ assumed our nature, and became man without the help of
   man; yet not exclusive of the help and assistance of his Father, who
   prepared a body for him; nor of the Holy Ghost, who formed and
   sanctified it in the virgin's womb. 2. The matter of it, and that is of
   the wood of Lebanon: Christ was conceived and born of the virgin Mary,
   who dwelt at Nazareth, a city of Galilee, at the foot of mount Lebanon;
   and the wood of that mountain, which was cedar, being of an
   incorruptible nature, may very well express the incorruption of
   Christ's human nature; for though he died and was buried, yet he never
   saw corruption: moreover this being very excellent and valuable wood,
   may denote the excellency and glory of Christ's human nature; whose
   countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars; for though, by his
   sorrows and sufferings, his visage was more marred than any man, and
   his form than the sons of men; yet he was fairer than any of the Sons
   of Adam. 3. The end for which this chariot was made; it wan for
   himself: for though all the three persons had a hand in making it, yet
   none but the second person appeared in it; it was the Son only, and not
   the Father, nor the Spirit, who was made flesh, and dwelt among us;
   which was done for the shewing forth of his own glory, as well as for
   the sake of his body, the church. Or else,

   Secondly, By this chariot, may be meant the church of Christ; [427]
   where he shews himself openly to his people in his ordinances, and they
   behold his power and his glory in the sanctuary; here he rides in
   triumph over his enemies; from hence he sends forth the rod of his
   strength, and makes mighty conquests by his grace over the hearts of
   men; here his gospel is preached, his ordinances administered, his name
   borne up, his cause and interest carried on, and his person alone
   exalted. Concerning which chariot we may also observe, 1. The author of
   it, Christ himself; it is he that builds this temple, and bears the
   glory; he is the rock, the foundation and cornerstone on which, and the
   chief architect by whom it is built; there are indeed many workmen and
   under-builders whom he employs herein, but he himself is the principal;
   his own hands have laid the foundation, and reared up the super,
   structure; it is he that has knit all together; and bears, supports,
   and maintains the whole fabric; and will bring in the head-stone, with
   the joyful acclamations of grace, grace unto it. 2. The matter of the
   wood of Lebanon: the temple which was built by Solomon, was an eminent
   figure of the church of Christ; now this was built of cedars fetched
   from Lebanon, which, though it was upon the borders of the land of
   Israel, yet was not in it; for Solomon sent to Hiram king; of Tyre for
   them, whose servants cut them down, hewed them, and made them fit for
   the building: Christ's true church is made up only of believers, such
   who are comparable to the cedars in Lebanon; who, though whilst in
   their state of nature are aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
   therefore are invited to come with Christ from Lebanon in chapter 4:8
   yet are cut down from off their old stock, and being hewn and fitly
   framed for the building by the grace and spirit of God, are laid in it,
   and so grow up unto an holy temple in the Lord: and this wood of
   Lebanon being lasting and durable, may denote the final perseverance of
   the saints, and the continuance of the church of Christ; which being
   built upon him, the rock, the gates of hell cannot prevail against it;
   it is as immoveable as mount Zion,. and as incorruptible as the cedars.
   3. The end for which it is made, and that is, for himself: Christ has
   made all things for himself; and more especially his church he has made
   for his own use; it is his house to dwell in, his garden to walk in,
   his bed to rest in, and his chariot to ride in; he has also made it for
   his own glory, and indeed much arises from it; his manifestative glory
   is much increased by it; this people he has formed for himself, and
   they shall shew forth his praise. Or else,

   Thirdly, By this chariot, may be meant the gospel, and the preaching of
   it; which may be also represented by the white horse, in Revelation 6:2
   on which Christ rides and goes forth, conquering and to conquer; the
   ministers also of which may be compared to chariots, as Elijah, in 2
   Kings 2:12 is called "the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof:"
   so Theodoret interprets it of the holy apostles. In this chariot Christ
   shews himself in all the glory of his love and grace; here, as in a
   glass, saints behold the glory of the Lord, and are changed into it; in
   this he is carried up and down the world, and by it is conveyed to the
   souls of men; this is that vehicle in which he is brought home unto
   them, and in which he triumphs over all his enemies, and makes his
   ministers to do so likewise: so that this is a triumphal chariot which
   he has made, and in which he shews himself to the world. And, 1. He is
   the alone author, as well as the subject, sum and substance of it, and
   therefore it is called "the gospel of Christ:" It is not the
   contrivance of human wisdom, the device of man's brain, nor the produce
   of carnal reason; it was neither projected, formed, nor delivered by
   man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ; it is he that has given it
   to men, and given men a commission to preach it, and furnished them
   with all necessary qualifications for it. 2. The matter of it is said
   to be "the wood of Lebanon;" which being incorruptible and durable, as
   has been before observed, as well as of a sweet-smelling savor, may
   very well be applied to the gospel of Christ, which is preached by his
   faithful ministers; who are not as some, who corrupt the word of God;
   but in doctrine, and also in life, shews incorruptness, gravity, and
   sincerity, and deliver sound speech which cannot be condemned; which
   will abide and continue, notwithstanding all the efforts of men and
   devils; and is of an exceeding grateful smell to believers, to whom it
   is the savor of life unto life. 3. This he has made also for himself;
   that is, for his own glory: which end is answered, when the riches of
   his grace and love are displayed, his person and offices magnified and
   exalted, and he declared to be the only way of salvation to lost
   sinners; as also when sinners are converted, and saints are edified
   under the ministry of the word, and the success of all ministerial
   labors is ascribed unto him. Or else,

   Fourthly, By this chariot, may be meant the covenant of grace; in
   which, as in a chariot, Christ shews his royal person, and the glorious
   sovereignty and freeness of his love: by this, as in a chariots many
   poor souls are borne up and supported under, and are comfortably
   carried through a great many trials and exercises in this life, and in
   Which they are brought triumphantly to glory: the same blood of the
   everlasting covenant, which fetched Christ out of his grave, brings
   souls out of the pit wherein is no water, and introduces them into the
   kingdom of Jesus Christ. And, 1. Of this chariot, Christ, who is here
   meant by king Solomon, is the author: man is not in a capacity to make
   a covenant with God; he has nothing of his own, but what God, before
   all articles, agreements, conditions, grants, and promises, has a prior
   right unto; but Christ, as the representative of the elect, has made a
   covenant with his father on their account; his wisdom drew the plan and
   model of it, he then acting as the counsellor, or as the angel of the
   great council; [428] his power effected it; being the mighty God, and
   his grace filled it as the mediator of it; he had so great a hand and
   concern in it, as that lie is called the surety, mediator, and
   messenger of it, nay, the covenant itself. 2. The matter of it, or of
   what it was made, is the wood of Lebanon: which may intend the
   durableness and inviolableness of the covenant of grace; for God will
   not break it, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his lips; it is
   as lasting as the wood, and as immoveable as the mountain of Lebanon
   itself; its promises are yea and amen, and its blessings are
   irreversible; it is of an everlasting nature in itself, and can never
   be disannulled by men or devils; and contains things in it both for
   time and eternity. 3. His end in making this is his own glory, as well
   as the good Of his people; he had both in view: the former is mentioned
   here, he made it for himself; the latter in the next verse, where it is
   also said to be for the daughters of Jerusalem. Christ's glory and his
   church's good are inseparable; his glory is great in their salvation
   which shews with what wisdom, and in what a beautiful and excellent
   order, the covenant of grace is made. It is interpreted of the
   everlasting covenant by some Jewish writers. [429]

Chapter 3 Verse 10

   He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold,
   the covering of it of purple; the midst thereof being paved with
   love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church goes on to give some farther account of this chariot,
   which Christ, the true Solomon, had made for himself; and says,

   I.That "the pillars of it were of silver."

   II.The "bottom of gold."

   III.The "covering of purple." And,

   IV.That "the midst of it was paved with love; and that either by or for
   the daughters of Jerusalem." Now the explanation of these several parts
   must be according to the several senses which have been given of the
   chariot in the former verse. And,

   I.If by the chariot we understand the human nature of Christ, then,

   1st, By the pillars of it, are meant the several graces of the Spirit,
   which both adorned and supported it; for besides the habitual holiness
   of his nature, and the innocence of his life, there appeared in him a
   strong faith in God; and that not only throughout the whole of his
   life, but in the midst of his dolorous sufferings, nay, when deserted
   by his Father; as also great courage and magnanimity of mind, as well
   as much patience and humility in doing and suffering all he did: and
   these may be called pillars, both for the mighty strength that was in
   them; for grace was not weak in Christ, as it is in us; and also for
   the support they were of unto him; in the exercise of which the chariot
   of the human nature was kept, as it were, upon its wheels: and these
   are said to be of silver, to denote the excellency, brightness, and
   solidity of those graces; and which appeared to be so, even when as
   silver they were tried in the furnace of affliction. And,

   2dly, By the "bottom of gold," may be meant his deity; and so denotes,
   that the subsistence of the human nature is in the divine person; the
   human nature never did, nor never will subsist without it; as soon as
   ever it was conceived in the virgin's womb, it was united to the divine
   person of Christ, and has ever been since supported by it, both in its
   state of humiliation and exaltation; it is this which lies at the
   bottom of, and puts an efficacy into all Christ's mediatorial actions,
   and makes them powerful to answer the ends for Which they are
   performed; the effusion of his blood, the oblation of his sacrifice,
   and the bringing in of a righteousness, would not have been sufficient
   to have expiated sin, satisfied justice, answered the demands of a
   righteous law, and discharged the sinner, had they not been the blood,
   sacrifice, and righteousness of God; it is the impress of Deity upon
   them, which makes them efficacious to answer all these purposes. Now
   this being called a bottom, is no ways a lessening or a diminution of
   the glory of Christ's deity, any more than his being called a
   foundation is; but rather serves to set forth the glory and greatness
   of it, as its being said to be of gold manifestly shews. And then also,

   3dly, By the purple covering of this chariot, which seems to be in
   allusion to the curtains of the tabernacle, Exodus 26:1 may be meant,
   either the passion and sufferings of Christ in the human nature, by
   which his garments were as though they had been dyed; and he appeared
   red in his apparel; nay, clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; so
   that the covering of the human nature of Christ may well be said to be
   of purple: or else, it means his royal dignity, and his exaltation,
   after sufferings; this being a color used by kings and great persons;
   he was clothed with a purple robe before his sufferings, by way of
   derision; but now he is really made lord and Christ; he was then, in a
   way of mockery, crowned with thorns; but now, in the same nature, is
   crowned with glory and honor. And then,

   4thly, By the midst of it, which is paved with love for the daughters
   of Jerusalem, may be meant the heart of Christ, which is filled with,
   and, as It were, paved with love for poor sinners; or, as the word
   [430] may be rendered, enflamed, or set on fire with love: It was this
   that moved him to espouse their cause, take upon him the care and
   charge of their persons, assume their nature, and die in their room and
   stead; which love of his, as to its quality, is the best; as to its
   degree, the greatest; as to its duration, for ever; from whence there
   is no separation, to which there is no parallel; and at present, to us
   finite creatures, incomprehensible: and all this is for the daughters
   of Jerusalem, the elect of God, or young converts; that is, it is all
   for their sakes, and out of love to them he made this chariot, or
   assumed human nature, according to what is said, Hebrews 2:14,
   "forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
   also himself likewise took part of the same:" or else the meaning is,.
   that such is the love of Christ towards these daughters, that if any
   one could but look into his heart, they would find the very images and
   pictures of them drawn there; who are not only engraven upon the palms
   of his hands, but are also set as a seal upon his heart; which was
   prefigured by the high-priest's bearing the names of the children of
   Israel in the breast-plate of judgment upon his heart, before the Lord
   continually; all which is expressive of that strong affection which he
   has unto them. But then,

   II.If by the chariot we understand the church of Christ, then,

   1st, By the pillars thereof are meant the ministers of the gospel; so
   of James, Cephas and John, the apostle Paul says, that they seemed to
   be pillars, and such as these are intended by the seven pillars, which
   wisdom had hewn out, and built her house upon, in Proverbs 9:1 who, for
   their strength, stability, and support to the church of Christ, may be
   compared to those two pillars in the porch of the temple, which are
   called, the one Jachin, and the other Boaz: for these are of great
   strength to the building; there is a very great weight rests upon them;
   these are the legs in Christ's body, which, like pillars of marble,
   stand firm and immoveable, notwithstanding the several pressures of
   reproaches, afflictions, persecutions, etc. which fall very hard and
   heavy upon them; for none of these things move them; but with an
   unshaken courage and magnanimity of mind they stand up under them; and
   in so doing, are very great supports to the cause, interest, and church
   of Christ; for though Christ is the foundation and the chief
   corner-stone, yet these are pillars, and have their usefulness. Now
   these are said to be of silver, because of their valuableness, both in
   the esteem of Christ, who has placed them in his church, and from whom
   they have all their strength and usefulness; and likewise in the esteem
   of saints, to whom they are made useful; for the tongue of the just,
   and especially of a gospel-minister, is as choice silver: these are the
   silver trumpets, which sound forth and proclaim peace and pardon, life
   and salvation to poor, lost, and rebellious sinners; their words, when
   fitly spoken, and adapted to the eases of souls, either of afflicted
   saints, or distressed sinners, are like apples of gold in pictures of
   silver Moreover, this may be expressive of their shine and luster, both
   in doctrine and lift; who preach the gospel in its power and purity,
   hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience; and who, the more
   they are vilified, reproached, afflicted and persecuted for the sake of
   the gospel, the brighter they are, like silver purified seven times,
   And then,

   2dly, By the "golden bottom," may be meant Christ; who is the
   foundation of his church and people, on which they are laid and firmly
   built; and is the only foundation of their everlasting salvation, of
   all their faith, hope, joy and comfort here, and of their eternal
   happiness hereafter: and a good bottom this is; happy is every one that
   is upon it; it may well be said to be "of gold," because of the glory
   and splendor of it; it is the "foundation of the apostles and
   prophets," which they ministerially laid, and on which their persons
   are secured equally with others; hence the foundations of the new
   Jerusalem are said to be twelve, and each of them compared to a
   precious stoned to set forth the excellency thereof: nay, this
   foundation is a super-excellent one; for "other foundation can no man
   lay," which is in any respect valuable, or upon any account to be
   compared to this "which is laid, which is Christ Jesus." Moreover, for
   the durableness of it, it may be said to be of gold; for "the righteous
   is an everlasting foundation;" that is, the righteous man's foundation
   is such an one; or he is built upon one that will last for ever; and
   such an one is Christ; a foundation that will never decay; but will
   always abide firm and strong; and is sufficient to bear the whole
   weight of the building to all eternity. And then,

   3dly, The "purple covering" may intend either, 1. The suffering state
   of the church; being attended with a variety of afflictions
   tribulations and persecutions, and sometimes as it were covered with
   blood, as the histories of several ages testify. Or else, 2. Her regal
   dignity, to which she and all believers are advanced by Christ, who has
   made them "kings and priests to God and his father;" purple being a
   color in use among great persons, may very well represent this. Or, 3.
   Her being clothed with the robe of Christ's righteousness; which may be
   said to be of a purple color, because it is the produce and effect of
   Christ's blood, and is as it were dipped into it; hence believers are
   said to be "justified by his blood" in Romans 5:9. Or, 4. It may
   signify her being washed in Christ's blood, together with the outward
   garments of her conversation, and so appear to be of this dye, And
   then,

   4thly, By the midst thereof, which is "paved with love," may be meant,
   either the hearts of believers, or of the church, filled with a sense
   of Christ's love shed abroad in them, or inflamed with love to Christ
   [431] which, though it is sometimes in a decaying and declining
   condition, yet is never entirely moved; for who "can separate from the
   love of Christ?" that is, either from Christ's love to his people, or
   from their love to him: or else, by this pavement of love in the midst
   of the church, may be meant the ordinances of Christ; which he has
   instituted for the sake of the daughters of Jerusalem, or young
   converts; through which he discovers his love unto them, and by an
   attendance on which they discover their love, both to Christ and to his
   church; and the church again discovers her love to them, by a cheerful
   admission of them to these ordinances. But then,

   III.If by the chariot we understand the gospel and the preaching of it,
   then,

   1st, By the silver pillars thereof," are meant the truths and doctrines
   of it; which, like pillars, are solid and substantial, and continue
   firm and immoveable, and not like chaff, which is driven away with
   every wind; nor like such combustible and perishing things, as wood,
   hay and stubble; but like gold, silver, and precious stones; and are of
   very great use to support God's children under the several trials and
   exercises which they are attended with, and that either in adversity or
   prosperity, in life or in death; and therefore for their value, utility
   and duration, may be compared to pillars of silver; and ought to be as
   diligently and carefully sought for and into as silver is, and to be
   received and preferred before it; for, to get wisdom in gospel-truths,
   "is better than gold;" and to get understanding in gospel-doctrines,
   "is rather to be chosen than silver," Proverbs 16:16. And then,

   2dly, By "the "golden bottom," may be meant Christ himself, who is the
   sum and substance of the gospel: to preach Christ, and him only, as
   God's way of salvation to sinners, was the old, primitive, and
   apostolical way of preaching; and which God blessed and owned, and
   continues so to do, for the conversion of sinners, and the comfort of
   saints: that gospel, of Which Christ is not the sum and substance, is
   like a chariot without a bottom; and such an one is good for nothing;
   for who would venture to ride in it? But where Christ is the main and
   principal subject insisted on, there is a good bottom, nay) a golden
   one; or a good seat, ajnakli&gt;ton, "a reclining place," as the
   Septuagint render it, to sit and rest in, or lean upon. And also,

   3dly, By the "purple covering," may be meant particularly those
   doctrines of the gospel, which concern our redemption from the law, and
   the curses of it; the pardon of our sins, and our justification through
   Christ's precious blood; for which reason they may be said to be of
   this color. And,

   4thly, This pavement of love may signify, that the whole gospel is full
   of love; wherein, in a very lively manner, is set forth the love of God
   the Father, in contriving and drawing the scheme and model of our
   salvation before all time; and in sending his Son in the fullness of
   time, to accomplish what was agreed on before, that he should do; as
   also the love of Christ in becoming man, sustaining all the sorrows of
   life, and sufferings of death; and al1 for the sake and in the room and
   stead of vile, sinful, and rebellious sinners; it gives us such
   instances of love as never were heard of before, which never were, nor
   never will be paralleled; its whole language is love; it is nothing
   else but a free promise and declaration of God's love and grace to
   sinful man; so that it may well be said to be paved with it: and how
   delightful must such a pavement be to the daughters of Jerusalem, to
   all young converts, either to behold or sit upon, where nothing but the
   love that is between Christ and his church is beautifully described?
   But then,

   IV.If by the chariot we understand the covenant of grace, then,

   1st, By the silver pillars, may be meant the promises thereof; which,
   like pillars, are firm and. immoveable, solid and substantial; they are
   all yea and amen in Christ; not one of them shall ever fail, being
   free, absolute and unconditional; and therefore are called better
   promises, as being preferable to those in the covenant of works, which
   required conditions to be fulfilled before the enjoyment of the things
   promised. These, like pillars, are the support of God's children, under
   the variety of troubles they are exercised with; these yield them
   relief, are reviving cordials, and fill them with joy and comfort when
   nothing else can. O! of what profit and advantage has a promise been to
   a sinking believer, when it has been seasonably brought, and suitably
   applied by the spirit! there are some promises which the saints would
   not have out of their bibles for millions of worlds: and these may be
   said to be of silver, because of their preciousness, richness and
   durableness; they are "exceeding great and precious," are of more worth
   than "thousands of gold and silver;" and will last for ever, being the
   sure "mercies of David;" nay, the more they are tried, used, and
   handled by faith, the brighter and more glorious will they look. And
   then,

   2dly, By the golden bottom of this covenant, must be meant. Christ; who
   is the covenant itself, not only materially, but fundamentally; he is
   not only the matter and substance of it, all the blessings and promises
   of it being comprised in him, but also the foundation of it; he bears
   the whole weight of the covenant, and is, as has been observed, the
   surety, mediator, and messenger of it. Now this bottom, for its
   richness, firmness and duration, may be said to be of gold; souls who
   are in this chariot, the covenant of grace, need never fear falling
   through; it can never be unbottomed; once in covenant, and always so;
   and therefore it is said to be ordered in all things, and sure; because
   it has such a bottom, it can never be broken, nor will it ever be
   removed. And then,

   3dly, Its purple coveting may intend the blood of Christ, which is
   called "the blood of the everlasting covenant;" by which, not only the
   covenant is ratified, and confirmed; but all that are in it and are
   under this cover [432] have their sins blotted out, hid and covered; so
   that when they are sought for, and the most diligent scrutiny made for
   them by justice, they shall not be found. Moreover, their persons are
   hereby eternally screened from the wrath of God; so that though showers
   of wrath shall fall upon the heads of Christless sinners, yet all under
   this purple covering shall be safe, and not have the least drop fall
   upon them; but shall, in this chariot of rich and glorious grace, be
   safely preserved, protected, and conveyed to eternal glory.

   4thly, The midst of it being paved with love shews that this covenant
   is full of love: It was love that set Christ on work to make it, and
   engaged him to be the surety, mediator, and messenger of it; it is made
   up of nothing but love; love has filled it with precious promises and
   spiritual blessings; and all for the daughters of Jerusalem, to whom
   love in time communicates them: O! what a delightful and easy chariot
   must this be to ride in, which is 1ined with love! love is the hangings
   of it all around, and the velvet cushions and pillows on which faith
   leans; with what splendor, stateliness and majesty, as well as ease and
   pleasure then, does the believer go to glory? The Jewish writers as I
   have already observed, by the chariot, understand the tabernacle or
   temple; and by its pillars, bottom, covering and middle, the ark of the
   testimony, with the two tables of stone, which are more precious than
   gold and silver; the golden mercy-seat, the veil of blue and purple,
   and the seat of the Shekinah between the two Cherubims, which are upon
   the mercy-seat: To this purpose are the Targum, and the gloss of R.
   Solomon Jarchi upon the place. Moreover, besides the several senses
   which have been already given of these words, it may not be amiss to
   observe, that by this bride-chamber, as some render the word in verse 9
   may be meant the royal palace; and how well the description of it in
   this verse agrees with what is given of the new Jerusalem, in
   Revelation 21 will best appear by comparing both together: which
   bridal-palace Christ is now preparing for his spouse, and when that is
   ready for her, and she for that, being "perfumed with myrrh and
   frankincense," she shall be kindly welcomed and cheerfully received;
   where the nuptial feast will be kept, and Christ shall be seen by all
   the daughters of Zion in all his glory, and with his royal diadem upon
   his head, as he is described in the following verse.

Chapter 3 Verse 11

   Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and beholding Solomon with the
   crown wherewith his mother crowned him, in the day of his
   espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are not the words of Christ, for he is the person spoken of
   and represented in this glorious manner; nor are they the speech of the
   daughters of Jerusalem, young converts, for they are the persons spoken
   to, who are here called the daughters of Zion; nor are they to be
   considered as the angels exhortation to all the elect to forsake the
   world, and contemplate Christ by faith in the glory of his kingdom
   after his resurrection, as some think: but they are the words of the
   church, who, observing that the daughters of Jerusalem were first
   struck with admiration at the sight of her, as coming up out of the
   wilderness, in verse 6. and that their eyes were now intently fixed
   upon the bed and chariot she had been describing in the former verses,
   calls them off from these things and proposes a far more glorious
   object to them, to whom her own glory was not to be compared; nay, king
   Solomon, in all his glory, either on his coronation or marriage-day, to
   which the allusion seems to be, cannot equal him; and if his bed and
   chariot were so acceptable to them, and gave them so much pleasure to
   behold, she might well conclude that a sight of his person, especially
   in all his regal glory, could not but be grateful to them; and
   therefore bids them go forth and behold him to which no doubt they
   would be forward enough; for the sight of a crowned king, as he passes
   along the streets, especially on his coronation day, is very desirable
   to people, who come forth out of their houses, or look out of their
   windows to behold the sight.

   There is a very great variety in the opinions of interpreters about the
   time to which these words should be referred. The ancient Jewish
   writers [433] refer them to the time of Solomon's finishing the temple,
   and his dedication of it, and to the joy and gladness which appeared on
   that solemn occasion; but that was neither his coronation nor his
   marriage-day: R. Solomon Jarchi [434] applies them to the time of the
   giving of the law, when the Israelites acknowledged God as their king,
   by subjecting themselves to it; for though Moses was legislator, yet
   God was king in Jeshurun; as also to the erection and dedication of the
   temple in the wilderness: Others refer them to the time of Solomon's
   being crowned king of Israel, which may be ascribed to his mother
   Bathsheba, as the moral cause of it; [435] who, by her entreaties and
   supplications, procured it for him; and which was "the day of his
   espousals" to the people of Israel, and no doubt "the day of the
   gladness of his heart." Others [436] refer to the time of his marriage
   to Pharaoh's daughter; at which time it was the custom, not only of
   other nations [437] but of the Jews, to crown married persons, to which
   perhaps the allusion is made in Ezekiel 16:12 and of those nuptial
   crowns mention is made in the Misnah; [438] others refer them to the
   incarnation of Christ; [439] and think that by the crown, is meant his
   humanity, which he received from his mother, the virgin Mary; at which
   time he espoused our nature, and was no less a day of gladness to him
   than to us: it being what he gladly performed, and had been long
   desirous of, as is manifest from the several preludiums of it in the
   Old Testament: though others [440] have been of opinion, that the words
   regard the passion and sufferings of Christ; at which time he was
   crowned with a crown of thorns, and by his blood purchased and espoused
   the church to himself; which bloody baptism of his was so desirable to
   him, that he was even straitened until it was accomplished: but though
   the allusion, as I have already hinted, is to the coronation and
   marriage-day of king Solomon; yet I should rather think that the words
   have reference to Christi as the glorious mediator, when first
   discovered to a poor sinner in all the fullness of his grace, as
   sitting and riding in the chariot of the everlasting gospel: concerning
   which we may observe,

   First, The persons who are spoken to and exhorted to go forth and
   behold Christ, and they are the daughters of Zion: Zion was a mount,
   situate on the north side of Jerusalem, and is sometimes used for the
   city itself; and was a figure of the church of Christ, which sometimes
   bears this name in scripture: by the daughters of it, we are to
   understand the same who are in this song often called the daughters of
   Jerusalem; by which we have all along understood young converts; who
   may be called the daughters of Zion, because Christ, who is here thus
   gloriously described, is king thereof (see Ps. 149:2; Zech. 9:9).

   Secondly, The object which is proposed to them to behold, is king
   Solomon, or the Lord Jesus Christ, who is greater than Solomon, and was
   typified by him, and in what respects has been shewn on verse 7. And it
   may not be amiss to remark, what one [441] well observes, that there is
   a manifest gradation in these verses: in verse 7 he is only called
   Solomon; in verse 9 king Solomon; and here in this verse, "king Solomon
   with a crown;" for, as the same author observes, "the longer she speaks
   of Christ, and insists in mentioning his excellency, her thoughts draw
   the deeper, she sets him up the higher, and becomes warmer in her
   apprehensions, affections, and expressions concerning him." And
   therefore I shall now,

   Thirdly, Consider this circumstance of Christ's glory, he being
   represented with a "crown, wherewith his mother crowned him in the day
   of his espousals, etc." and here it will be proper to inquire, 1st, Who
   we are to understand by his mother. 2dly, What by the Crown wherewith
   she crowned him. 3dly, The time of his coronation, which is here
   expressed," in the day of his espousals, etc."

   1st, By his mother, we are not to understand Bathsheba, the mother of
   Solomon; nor the Virgin Mary, the natural mother of Christ: but either,
   the church of Christ, the Jerusalem above, which is the mother of us
   all, who being the mother of Christ mystical, may be said to be the
   mother of Christ also; or else, every particular believer may be
   intended, who stands related to Christ as his brother, and as one who
   has sucked the breasts of one and the same mother; see chapter 8:1 who
   not only is called Christ's brother and sister, but also his mother:
   Matthew 12:50 in whose heart Christ is formed, by whom he is
   affectionately loved, even as an only child is by a tender mother; and
   for whose honor, glory and interest there is a very great concern. But,

   2dly, What is meant by this crown, wherewith he is crowned by his
   mother. Christ has a crown and kingdom, as he is God, equal with the
   Father, but this is not put upon him, nor given to him by any; he has a
   natural right unto it which none can give nor take away from him; he
   being "in the form of God," and in all respects equal to him, "thought
   it no robbery" to assume this crown and kingdom to himself: he has also
   one as he is Mediator; and this is put upon him, not by his mother, but
   by his Father; who has "anointed him with the oil of gladness above his
   fellows," and placed him as "king over his holy hill of Zion," and set
   "a crown of pure gold upon his head." And thus now, by faith, believers
   see him, "crowned with glory and honor;" all which will more manifestly
   appear at the last day, when there will be a more open and visible
   coronation of Christ than has hitherto been; though he has very often
   now a "crown given to him," as the triumphant conqueror over the hearts
   of men; by the mighty power of his grace displayed in the everlasting
   gospel, in which he goes forth" conquering and to conquer." But it
   seems to me that the crown which is here meant, is that which every
   true believer puts on Christ, when their souls are brought to venture
   on him, and believe in him: every act of faith is a putting the crown
   on Christ's head; and every submission to his commands and ordinances,
   is an acknowledging of him as king of saints; and the giving up of
   their souls unto him, and owning him as their head and husband, is "a
   crown of glory, and a royal diadem" in his hand; even as converts are a
   "crown of rejoicing" to ministers, and "a virtuous woman is a crown to
   her husband:" and in nothing more do believers do this, than when they
   ascribe all they have and are, to his grace, and say, with the apostle,
   It is "by the grace of Christ I am what I am;" for by so doing, they
   not only cast their crowns at Christ's feet, but set another upon his
   head; whereas, on the contrary, they take the crown from off Christ's
   head, who do not believe on him, despise his commands, neglect his
   ordinances, and ascribe their salvation, either in whole or in part,
   unto themselves, their own works and duties. Moreover, this honor
   Christ justly deserves from us; and it is an incumbent duty to give it
   to him; for be, in creation, crowned man, and set him over all the
   works of his hands, and made him but little inferior to the angels
   themselves; and by his incarnation, has crowned the human nature with
   such glory and honor, as it never had in a state of innocence itself;
   it being united to a divine person, and is now exalted at the Father's
   right hand, which is an honor none of the angelic race ever enjoyed;
   for, "to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit at my right
   hand?" who also, in the redemption of us from the curse of the law, the
   slavery and servitude of sin, Satan, and the world, in the remission of
   our sins by his blood, the justification of our persons by his
   righteousness, and sanctification of our hearts and natures by his
   grace and spirit, has "crowned us with loving-kindness and tender
   mercies." In short, he has laid up for us a "crown of righteousness,
   life and glory," which he, the righteous judge, will give unto and put
   upon the heads of all his people; so that there is a great deal of
   reason to crown Christ, and acknowledge him alone as our Lord and King,
   our head. and husband, our savior and redeemer, who was crowned with
   thorns for us, and has crowned us with his grace now and will ere long
   crown us with glory. But,

   3dly, The time of this coronation as next to be enquired into; and that
   is said to be "in the day of his espousals," that is, on his
   marriage-day; for Christ's coronation and marriage day are one and the
   same day. Now, by this "day of his espousals," we are to understand the
   time of a poor sinner's being enabled, by mighty grace, to give up
   itself to the Lord, when it consents to be his for ever: this marriage
   was made and agreed upon in the everlasting council and covenant of
   grace and peace; Christ made it his request to his Father, and he
   granted him it; he gave his full consent unto it; so that there
   remained only the actual consent of the persons themselves, for whom
   Christ had such a strong love and affection which is obtained by the
   powerful workings of his grace and spirit in time upon their hearts;
   and that often under the ministry of the word, where they are "espoused
   as a chaste virgin to Christ;" at which time there is a large breaking
   forth; not only of Christ's love to and upon their hearts, but also of
   theirs to Christ which is called the love of their espousals, and which
   Christ afterwards remembers, when it has grown cold and chill towards
   him: thus every time that a particular soul is brought to Christ, it is
   both a coronation, and an espousal day; but the great coronation and
   espousal-day is yet to come, when all the elect shall be brought in,
   and it shall be said, "The marriage of the lamb is come, and the bride
   is ready; then shall the king, with her, enter into the
   marriage-chamber, where the nuptials will be solemnized, and he openly
   and publicly crowned king of saints, where he will reign with them in
   all his glory. Some of the Jewish writers interpret this "day of
   espousals," of the days of the Messiah [442] Now this "day of his
   espousals," with particular believers, as well as the more glorious one
   that is to comes is called "the day of the gladness of his heart:"
   which shews how welcome poor sinners are to Christ, and how gladly and
   cheerfully he receives them; it is not only the joy of angels, but the
   joy and gladness of his heart, when sinners are converted to him, and
   believe on him; the bridegroom cannot more rejoice over his bride on
   his marriage-day, than Christ does over poor coming sinners; and when
   all his saints are together with him in heaven to behold his glory,
   what joy and gladness will then fill his heart? But,

   Fourthly, We may observe the duty which is enjoined those daughters of
   Zion; and that is, 1. To go forth, i.e. out of themselves; for a man
   can never see any glory and excellency in Christ, until he looks out of
   himself alone to him: the church would have these daughters turn away
   their eyes from every thing else, and view this glorious object only;
   for every thing else, though never so valuable, is to be forsaken and
   left for the sake of him, who is preferable to all enjoyments whatever.
   2. To behold him: the former is in order to this; for as persons
   sitting within doors, cannot behold an object that is passing by,
   unless they arise, get up, and go forth or look out; so neither can
   believers discern this glorious object without going forth. The church
   would have these daughters behold Christ with attention, affection,
   faith, and admiration; she would have them fix their eyes upon him,
   look upon him, and love him; look upon him, and believe in him; look
   upon him, and wonder at him; for there are astonishing beauties,
   incomparable excellencies, transcendent glories in him, which deserve
   such looks as these.

   Chapter 4
     __________________________________________________________________

   In this chapter is contained a large commendation of the church's
   beauty by Christ: first, more particularly, by an enumeration of
   several parts, as her eyes, hair, teeth, lips, temples, neck and
   breasts, verses 1-5, and more generally, verse 7; and having observed
   where he himself was determined to go, he invites her to go with him;
   which he enforces, partly from the danger she was exposed unto where
   she was, verses 6, 8, and partly from the comeliness of her person and
   graces in his esteem; with which he was ravished, and therefore was
   extremely desirous of her company, verses 9-11; and then enters into
   some new descriptions of her, as a garden and an orchard, as a spring
   and fountain, verses 12-14. All which she makes to be owing to him,
   verse 15. And the chapter is closed with an order from Christ to the
   winds, to blow on his garden, and cause the spices of it to flow out;
   and with an invitation of the church to Christ, to come into his
   garden, and recreate himself there, verse 16

Chapter 4 Verse 1

   Behold thou art fair, my love, behold thou art fair; thou hast doves"
   eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear
   from mount Gilead.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words Christ reassumes his part in this Song, and
   enters upon a commendation of his church's beauty; which he does,

   First, More generally by asserting it, when he says, "Behold thou art
   fair" etc. in which general commendation of her beauty, we have, 1st,
   An affectionate character given to her, "my love." 2dly, Something
   asserted of her, that she was fair. 3dly, This assertion repeated.
   4thly, To this assertion the word behold prefixed. This commendation we
   have already met with, expressed in the same words, in chapter 1:15.
   where this kind and loving character has been opened; in what sense the
   chinch may be said to be fair, shewn; as also the reasons of Christ's
   repeating this assertion, and prefixing to it the word. behold, are
   given: The reasons why these words are again mentioned by him, perhaps
   may be to shew how much his heart was taken with her beauty; that his
   love to her was the same as ever it was, notwithstanding her sleepy
   frames and unbecoming carriage to him; as also, because she might stand
   in need of the fresh discoveries of his love.

   Secondly, He gives some particular instances of her beauty" in this and
   the four following verses.

   1st, He describes the beauty of her eyes, and asserts, that she has
   doves" eyes within her locks: in which words we are to consider, 1.
   What we are to understand by her eyes. 2. Why they are called doves"
   eyes. 3. Why they are said to be within her locks.

   1. By the church's eyes we may understand, either the ministers of the
   gospel, who are to the church what eyes are to an human body; they are
   placed in the more eminent part of Christ's body, the church, to watch,
   overlook, guide and direct the other members of the body: or else, by
   them may be intended, the eyes of the understanding being illuminated
   by the divine Spirit; and more especially the eye of faith, by which a
   soul, enlightened by divine grace, beholds the glory, fullness, and
   suitableness of Christ, and looks to him alone for life and salvation.

   2. These eyes are called doves. Why ministers of the gospel are
   compared to doves, and the eye of faith said to be a dove's eye, have
   been already shewn on chapter 1:15.

   3. These eyes are said to be within her locks; which, if applied to the
   ministers of the gospel, may denote, 1. The imperfection of their light
   and knowledge, and that a great deal of darkness and obscurity attends
   them: they know but in part, and prophesy but in part; as eyes under
   the locks, being covered with them, cannot see so clearly, as when they
   are removed from them; so the ministers of the gospel cannot see so
   clearly into gospel-truths in this state of imperfection, as they
   shall, when these locks of darkness are removed; for then they shall
   see eye to eye: their knowledge of Christ is imperfect now; their light
   into gospel truths is weak and dim; and proportionate to their light
   and knowledge do they preach: the apostle. Paul, who had the greatest
   light into the gospel, and the largest share of the knowledge of Christ
   Jesus, that perhaps, ever any man had, yet desired to know more of
   Christ, and the power of his resurrection (Phil. 3:10). 2. It may be
   expressive of their modesty and humility: locks being decently tied up,
   as this word signifies [443] is an evidence of modesty, as the contrary
   is of wantonness: the ministers of the gospel, though they have the
   greatest gifts bestowed upon them, yet reckon themselves less than the
   least of all saints; for notwithstanding all their parts, gifts, and
   graces, they do not think themselves sufficient, either to think or
   speak any thing as of themselves: but acknowledge that their
   sufficiency is of God, who only hath made them able ministers of the
   New Testament; and whenever their labors are blest and owned, either
   for the comfort and edification of God's people, or for the conversion
   of sinners, they .ascribe it not to themselves, but to the grace of God
   that as with them. 3. This phrase may be added, to set forth their
   beauty; eyes, from under or within the locks decently and modestly
   bound up, look very beautiful; or under locks of hair, plaited and
   curled about the face, so that the eyes are but just seen, which add to
   the beauty of them: the ministers of the gospel appear beautiful, not
   only to Christ, who has counted them faithful, and put them into the
   ministry; but also to those to whom they are made useful, either for
   comfort and establishment, or for conviction and conversion; to these,
   even the very "feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth
   peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation,
   are beautiful," (Isa. 52:7).

   But if by these doves eyes we understand the enlightened eyes of the
   understanding, and particularly the eye of faith; then this phrase
   perhaps is used to denote, (1.) The imperfection of faith: the greatest
   believer has need to pray, with the apostles, "Lord, increase our
   faith;" there are some, ta&gt; uJverhmata, some things lacking, some
   deficiencies in faith which need perfecting; it is true, "faith is the
   evidence of things not seen," yet oftentimes it is very dark and
   obscure: indeed, when compared with Old Testament saints, believers
   under the New may be said with open face to behold, as in a glass, the
   glory of the Lord; but when compared with saints, possessed of the
   beatific vision, they see but through a glass darkly; their eyes are
   within their locks. (2.) To shew us what a modest grace faith is; it
   looks alone on Christ, it lives only on him; it receives all from him,
   and gives all the glory to him; it ascribes nothing in man's salvation
   to itself, nor to any thing done by the creature, but all to Christ and
   his grace; and so excludes boasting, as the apostle says (Rom. 3:27),
   "Where is boasting then? it is excluded: By what law? of works? nay;
   but by the law of faith." Had works any thing to do in man's salvation,
   boasting would have been encouraged and established; but God of his
   infinite wisdom has ordered it, that it should be of and through faith;
   that it might appear to be of grace, and not of works, lest any man
   should boast. (3.) To set forth how beautiful faith is in Christ's eye,
   and how much his heart is taken with it; as appears from the ninth
   verse of this chapter, where he says, "Thou hast ravished my heart, my
   sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,"
   that is, with the eye of faith.

   2dly, He describes her beauty by her hair, which he says "is as a flock
   of goats that appear from mount Gilead;" that is, like the hair of such
   a flock of goats, so Ben Melech; which in some countries, hangs down
   like the locks of womens hair plaited [444] and is thought to be most
   like human hair (1 Sam. 19:13), in the hair of women their comeliness
   greatly lies, and without which they are not pleasing, as Apuleius
   [445] observes: It is compared not to such hair for length and
   sleekness as for the color of it, being yellowish, which with women
   formerly was in esteem, and reckoned graceful; and great care was taken
   to make it look so, even as yellow as gold [446] nor was it unusual to
   compare the hair of women, and represent it as superior to a fleece of
   the choicest flock; [447] women in former times had their perukes made
   of goats hair. [448] This may be understood, 1st, Of the outward
   conversation of the saints; which may be compared to hair, for the
   following reasons.

   1. Because as the hair is for covering (1 Cor. 11:15), so is a
   well-ordered and gospel conversation a covering to the saints. The
   believer has many coverings; he has more garments than one: he is
   clothed with "the garments of salvation, and covered with the robe of
   Christ's righteousness; this is his justification, and what gives him a
   title to glory:" he has also the garment of sanctification, which is
   curiously wrought by the Spirit of God; and this makes him meet for the
   king's presence: and he has, besides these, his conversation, garments,
   which he is to watch and keep from being spotted with the flesh, and to
   wash them and make them white in the blood of the lamb; but these
   cannot cover sins, nor screen him from divine justice; this only the
   righteousness of Christ can do, by which his sins are so covered, that
   when they are sought for they shall not be found; but his outward
   conversation is "a covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in,"
   so as to be hid and secured from divine justice; if he was only to
   appear herein before justice, these very clothes would both abhor and
   condemn him: nor can they make him meet for the king's presence; this
   only the garment of sanctification can do: but then the outward
   conversation of the saints is a cover and a fence against the
   reproaches of the world; for though they have not whereof to glory
   before Gad, yet at some times and in some cases they may lawfully do it
   before men, and say, as Samuel did, "Whose ox have I taken? whom have I
   defrauded? Whom have I oppressed, or of whose hand have I received any
   bribe?" thus their conversation is a cover and fence unto them; and is
   of service to make those "ashamed who falsely accuse their good
   conversation an Christ, and to put to silence the ignorance of foolish
   men. 2. As hair is very ornamental to the believer: as garments, though
   they do not make, yet they adorn the man; so a good conversation,
   though it does not make, yet it adorns the Christian: It is decent and
   becoming the gospel of Christ Jesus; it adorns the doctrine of God our
   savior, and recommends religion to others. 3. As hair that is ordered
   aright, and well taken care of, so is a well-ordered conversation; that
   is such an one as is ordered, according to the rule of God's word, and
   by God himself; for, "the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord:"
   David knew this full well that God did so, and that he himself was
   insufficient for it; and therefore he thus prays, "order my steps in
   thy word," that is, according to thy word, which is the rule of faith
   and practice: and such a conversation as this being like a well-set and
   ordered head of hair, is very grateful and well-pleasing to Christ;
   therefore he says, "to him that ordereth his conversation aright, will
   I shew the salvation of God," (Ps. 1:23). 4. As the hair upon the head
   is conspicuous and manifest to all, so is the conversation of the
   saints: that they are justified by Christ's righteousness, and
   sanctified by his Spirit, are not seen and known of all men; but their
   outward conversation is manifest, and so it should be; "let your light
   so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify
   your Father which is in heaven," (Matthew 5:16). 5. As hair has its
   dependence upon, and influence from the head; so has the outward
   conversation of the saints its dependence on, and influence from the
   grace of the Spirit: a graceless professor, though he may keep up a
   moral conversation for a time; yet it will drop off from him like
   leaves from trees in autumn, or like hair that is shed from the head
   after a violent distemper; the "root of the matter" not being; in him:
   the difference between a man of grace and a graceless professor, is
   elegantly given by Jeremy (Jer. 17:5-8), the one is like the "heath in
   the desert," dry and barren; the other is like a "tree planted by the
   waters," moist and flourishing; "his leaf is green," and "he ceaseth
   not from yielding fruit." Thus the outward conversation of the saints
   may be compared to hair: and what may farther confirm this sense of the
   words, is, that the apostle Paul, in 1 Timothy 2:9, 10 instead of
   broidered hair, recommends shamefacedness, sobriety and good works, as
   more becoming godliness; and the apostle Peter, in 1 Peter 3:3, 4,
   instead of plaiting the hair, exhorts to an adorning with the "ornament
   of a meek and quiet spirit."

   Now this hair of the church's, or the outward conversation of the
   saints, may also be compared to a "flock of goats which appear from
   mount Gilead;" or, on mount Gilead, as Noldius: Gilead was a very
   proper place for cattle (Num. 32:1), and no doubt the goats which were
   fed there, as were usual on mountains [449] were fat and fruitful; and
   being in large numbers, and kept in good order, might appear from this
   mount, to distant spectators, beautiful and magnificent; their hair
   particularly might be long, smooth, sleek and glistering, and look very
   beautiful and lovely; especially in the morning at sun-rising, that
   glancing on them, with its bright and glittering rays, they were very
   delightful to behold; so R. Jonah, from the use of the word in the
   Arabic language which signifies the morning, interprets it, "which rise
   early in the morning:" and which, as Schultens [450] observes, some
   render, "leading to water early in the morning:" the Vulgate Latin
   version is, "that ascend from mount Gilead;" from a lower to a higher
   part of it; which Bochart approves of it. [451] So saints, being
   fruitful in every good word and work, and orderly in their lives and
   conversations, appear even to the world amiable and lovely; they are
   like to the he-goat, "comely in going," (Prov. 30:29-31), nay, to a
   flock of them on mount Gilead. Or else,

   2dly, By her hair, we may understand the inward thoughts of her heart
   [452] For, 1. As hair arises from and has its dependence upon the head,
   so do thoughts from the heart; it is out of the heart all evil thoughts
   proceed (Matthew 15:19); "out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, etc."
   and so all good thoughts, which are likewise formed and cherished there
   by the Spirit of God. 2. As the hairs of the head are numerous, so are
   the thoughts of the heart: a believer has many thoughts of heart; there
   is a multitude of thoughts within him (Ps. 94:19), concerning the
   corruption of his nature, the sinfulness of his actions, and his
   frequent backslidings from God; a multitude of thoughts concerning
   Christ and his grace, and the glories of another world. 3. As the hair
   of the head is weak and easily moved and tossed about by the wind; so
   are the thoughts of a believer's heart, sometimes this way and
   sometimes another; and are like the eyes of fools in the ends of the
   earth, unless fixed and established by the Spirit of God upon proper
   objects. 4. Being rightly ordered by the Spirit of God, as a
   well-managed and well-ordered head of hair, they are exceedingly
   admired and valued by Christ Jesus; for he has a "book of remembrance
   written," not only for them who speak of him and fear him, but also for
   those who think upon his name (Mal. 3:16).

   And as the thoughts of a believer's heart, thus fixed, managed and
   ordered by the Spirit of God, may be compared to hair, so likewise to a
   flock of goats on mount Gilead; and then may they be so. when they
   ascend on high, and dwell upon the everlasting, unchangeable and
   boundless love of God in Christ; which love has its heights and depths,
   its lengths and breadths; when they soar aloft, and dwell upon the
   everlasting covenant of grace; which covenant "is ordered in all things
   and sure," filled with all spiritual blessings and precious promises;
   when their thoughts are composed and settled upon the consideration of
   Christ's person, fullness, blood and righteousness; when they are
   employed about and concerned in the contemplation of the sublime
   doctrines of the gospel, and the invisible realities of another world;
   all which are things that are above; then may they be said to be like a
   flock of goats which appear from mount Gilead. But,

   3dly, I rather choose to understand, by the hair, believers themselves:
   Thus the people of Israel and inhabitants of Jerusalem are represented
   by hair (Ezek. 5:1-5). Now believers may be called so, 1. For their
   number: the hairs of a man's head are numerous; therefore when the
   Psalmist declares the large number of his sins and transgressions, he
   makes use of this metaphor, saying, "they are more than the hairs of my
   head:" indeed believers, when compared with the world, are but few, a
   small number, a remnant, and a little flock; yet considered and viewed
   by themselves, and when all together, they are a great multitude which
   no man can number (Rev. 7:9). 2. For their growing upon, and receiving
   nourishment from Christ, the head: the hair grows upon the head,
   receives its nourishment from it; Christ is the head o£ his body, the
   church; believers are the hair which grow upon, and grow up into this
   head; and from thence do they receive all their grace and strength,
   their life and liveliness, their food and nourishment, and so increase
   with "the increase of God," (Eph. 4:15, 16; Col. 2:19). 3. For their
   weakness in themselves, and dependence on Christ, the head: hair is a
   weak thing of itself, and has its dependence on the head; believers are
   weak, in them., selves, and can do nothing of themselves without him;
   their dependence is on him for strength, as well as for righteousness;
   and it is only through him strengthening them, that they do the things
   they do. 4. For their being an ornament to Christ, the head: hair is an
   ornament to the head; "the beauty of old men is the gray head:" saints
   are the ornament, beauty and glory of Christ; they are a crown of glory
   and a royal diadem in his hand, and upon his head. 5. For their
   valuableness to him, and the care he takes of them: a well-set head of
   hair is highly esteemed, and is taken much care of among men; but this
   cannot be more valued, and taken more care of, than believers are by
   Christ; he values them as his jewels and peculiar treasure, and he will
   not lose one of them; the hairs of our head are all numbered, and so
   are all the hairs of Christ's head, and not one of them shall be lost:
   it is true, those who are only nominal professors, and only by an
   external profession hold to the head, not being rooted in him, shall be
   shed from thence; but so shall not one of those who are one spirit with
   him, and grow upon him.

   Now saints may be compared to a flock of goats on mount Gilead. (1.)
   They may be compared to goats: it is true, this word is used of carnal
   and Christless sinners; who are called so in opposition to, and
   contradistinction from Christ's sheep; bat these creatures being
   offered up in sacrifice under the old law, prefigured Christ (Ex.
   12:5), and therefore we need not wonder that saints bear this
   character, who are enabled to present themselves to God, holy, living
   and acceptable sacrifices; as also, perhaps they may be so called, on
   the account of the remainder of sin and corruption: for in them, that
   is, in their "flesh, dwells no good thing;" and are stinking and
   abominable in the esteem of the world, reckoned by them the
   off-scouring and refuse of all things, as well as mean and vile in
   their own eyes. (2.) May be compared to a flock of them, because they
   belong unto and are under the care of one and the same shepherd, folded
   in one and the same fold, and fed together in one and the same pasture;
   as also, on the account of their Social worship, their assembling and
   walking together in the faith and order of the gospel. (3.) To a flock
   of them on mount Gilead: they have a good pasture upon a goodly mount;
   they live and feed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, that great mountain,
   which shall ere long fill the whole earth; here they find the best of
   pasture, and become fat and flourishing, like the goats on mount
   Gilead; here they live and dwell safely, secured from danger, and out
   of the reach of enemies; their place of defense is a munition of rocks,
   their bread is given them, and their waters sure," (Isa. 33:16).

Chapter 4 Verse 2

   Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came
   up from the washing: whereof every one bear twins, and none is
   barren among them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words contain the third particular instance of the church's
   beauty, viz. her teeth. Which were like the teeth of sheep, as her eyes
   were like the eyes of doves, and her hair like the hair of goats: and
   Galen long ago observed [453] that human teeth are much like the teeth
   of sheep, in figure, order and structure, as well as are small and
   white, neatly set, innocent and harmless; not ravenous and voracious,
   cropping only herbs and grass: the whiteness of the teeth is chiefly
   intended, in which the beauty of them lies; [454] and for which they
   are sometimes compared to Parian marble or whiteness. [455] These are
   compared,

   I.To a "flock of sheep."

   II.To a flock of sheep, "even shorn."

   III.To a flock of sheep that are just "come up from the washing."

   IV.To a flock of sheep that are fruitful, "whereof every one bear
   twins," etc.

   By her teeth we may understand,

   1st, The ministers of the gospel; [456] the Targum interprets it of the
   priests and Levites; and other Jewish writers [457] of the disciples of
   the wise men. Ministers may be called the church's teeth, 1. For
   strength: teeth are strong, being of a bony nature; and indeed the work
   that is allotted to them requires strength: the ministers of the gospel
   are Christ's strong men; who are, or at least need to be, "strong in
   the grace that is in Christ Jesus;" they have need to be "strong in the
   Lord, and in the power of his mighty;" for their work is great, and
   requires it, which is to labor in the word and doctrine; a work so
   great, arduous and difficult, that the great apostle Paul,
   notwithstanding all his gifts and grace, said, "Who is sufficient for
   these things?" they have need of strength to quit themselves like men
   in the defense of the gospel, for which they are set, against all
   opposers and gainsayers; they have need of strength to withstand
   Satan's. temptations; for he generally bends his bow, shoots his
   arrows, and casts his fiery darts most at them; they have need of
   strength to bear the world's reproaches and persecutions, of which they
   generally have the greatest share, and to sustain the infirmities of
   weaker saints, which are not few. 2. For their sharpness: teeth are
   sharp, and they ought to be so upon many accounts: the ministers of the
   gospel, though they are not to be like that generation, "whose teeth
   are as swords, and their jaw-teeth as knives;" to devour the flock; nor
   like ravenous wolves, who will not spare it, but prey upon it, for they
   are to use meekness and tenderness; yet in some cases, they are to use
   sharpness also, according to a power that Christ has given them, and
   lodged in them; as when persons are unsound in the faith, and corrupt
   in their morals: also as sharpness is necessary to teeth, that they may
   penetrate into, chew and prepare the food for the stomach; so is it
   necessary to ministers of the gospel, that they have abilities to
   penetrate into gospel-truths, in order to feed souls with the bread of
   life. 3. In nothing can they more fitly be compared to teeth, than in
   their preparing food for souls: as the teeth break the food, chew it,
   and prepare it for the stomach; so ministers of the gospel break the
   bread of life, make hard things plain, easy and intelligible; for not
   only in Paul's epistles, but in many other places of scripture, there
   are some dusno&gt;hta, "things hard to be understood." Now it is the
   work of the gospel to open and explain those difficult passages, remove
   the hard shell that is over them, that souls may eat the kernel; nay,
   they not only break the bread of life, but chew it, i.e. meditate upon
   the word, and digest the doctrines of grace themselves, that so they
   may not propose unto, or set before persons, crude, raw, and undigested
   food; but having chewed, digested, and well prepared it, they then
   present it to them; for these are the church's teeth, which cut [458]
   and rightly divide the word of truth," and give to every one their
   "portion of meat in due season." Now these teeth of the church, the
   ministers of the gospel, may be compared,

   I.To a flock of sheep, and to their teeth, for their harmlessness and
   innocence. They are sent forth by Christ as "sheep among wolves;" and
   so they live like sheep, useful to many, but hurtful to none; live
   harmless and inoffensive lives, though exposed to a variety of evils,
   for the sake of Christ and his gospel: "they are counted as sheep for
   the slaughter;" and yet, like sheep, they patiently bear all without
   murmuring, in imitation of their dear Lord, who was led like a lamb to
   the slaughter, and like the sheep before her shearers, is dumb, so he
   opened not his mouth (Isa. 53:7).

   II.To a flock of sheep even shorn. There is no word in the original
   text for any animal, neither sheep nor goats; it is only "to a flock of
   shorn ones;" and may be supplied from the preceding verse, "a flock of
   goats even shorn:" for in some countries, particularly in Cilicia,
   goats were shorn, as sheep in other places; [459] and so in Lycias:
   [460] but inasmuch as the word sheep is in a parallel text, chapter
   6:6. it seems best to supply it so here: and the comparison is to their
   teeth, that are equally alike in bigness and size; do not stand out nor
   rise up one above another; but are as if they had been cut, and planed,
   and made alike, as some [461] render the word; which is a better
   rendering, since sheep are not shorn before washing, but after it; nor
   is the word ever used of sheering wool: which may denote the equality
   of the ministers of the word, having such an agreement with each other,
   as the cherubim in Solomon's temple, which were of "one measure and one
   size," (1 Kings 6:25). Now the ministers of the gospel may be compared
   to such teeth, 1. Because they are equal in power and authority; though
   one may be superior to another in gifts and grace, in parts and
   learning, yet one has not a superior power and jurisdiction over
   another; for, as Christ says to his disciples (Matthew 20:25, 26); "the
   princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them; and they that are
   great exercise authority upon them; but it shall not be so among you;
   but whosoever shall be great among you, let him be your minister:" no
   such dominion and authority are allowed by Christ to be exercised by
   one minister, pastor or bishop, over another; they are like to the
   teeth of sheep that are even; one is not higher than another, nor
   superior to another in power; Peter was not above the rest of the
   apostles. 2. They have all the same commission, and are sent about the
   same work: the disciples of Christ were equally sent to preach the
   gospel to every creature; and the commission now is of the same and of
   as large, extent as ever; and the same commission that is given to one
   minister, is given to another; for they are all sent to preach one and
   the same gospel, in the full extent of it; not one part of it is
   assigned to one, and another part to another, but the whole is assigned
   to them all; for a different gospel is not given in commission to one
   to preach, than what is given to another; though their manner of
   preaching, and their success in their ministry, may not be alike. 3.
   They may be said to be as the teeth of sheep even, on the account of
   the harmony and agreement there is between the doctrines which they
   preach: though there may be a diversity of gifts, and one minister may
   have more gospel-light and knowledge than another, yet the doctrine of
   grace, preached by them, is one and the same; it is one and the same
   Jesus whom they preach; one and the same way of salvation which they
   shew; and one and the same heavenly inheritance which they are pointing
   at; which harmony and agreement of doctrine will more manifestly
   appear, when the "watchmen shall see eye to eye," even at the time
   "when the Lord shall bring again Zion," (Isa. 52:8). 4. These teeth of
   the church may be said to be like to the teeth of sheep even, to denote
   their mildness, meekness, harmlessness and innocence; sheep not having
   teeth or tushes, standing out more, or rising up higher than the rest,
   as ravenous beasts, such as lions, bears, etc. but are all equal and
   even; so such ministers do not devour, but feed the flock; do not
   assume a lordly and domineering power over them; but, behaving
   themselves quietly and peaceably among them, seek their good and
   welfare, and not their hurt.

   III.To a flock of sheep just "come up from the washing; and so are
   white and clean; which is another thing in which the beauty of teeth
   consists; for it is not only requisite that they should be even, so as
   one does not grow out from, nor rise higher than the other; but
   likewise that they should be white and clean, like sheep that are just
   come out of the washing pit: which some [462] think intends baptism;
   though it may be better understood "of the washing of regeneration, and
   renewing of the Holy Ghost," which the ministers of the gospel ought
   not to be strangers to; for he that is not "born again of water, and of
   the spirit," as he shall neither "see nor enter into the kingdom of
   heaven" himself; so is he not fit to preach the gospel of the kingdom
   of heaven to others: though I rather think, it intends the pure and
   unspotted lives and conversations of Christ's ministers,; who, being
   persons that hate the "garment spotted with the flesh," and who "have
   washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the lamb;"
   become examples to the flock, not only in faith, but in purity of
   conversation.

   IV.To a flock, of which "every one bears twins, and there is none
   barren among them." The figures are just and beautiful; it is common
   with sheep to bear twins or more in the eastern countries, as the
   philosopher [463] observes: these may answer to the two rows of teeth,
   and the word for teeth is in the dual number; and when these are white,
   clean and equal, are well set, and not one is wanting, none rotten, nor
   shed, nor fallen out, look very beautiful. This is to be understood of
   the fruitfulness and successfulness of their ministry, in begetting and
   bringing forth many souls to Christ; which was more especially verified
   in the apostles and first preachers of the gospel, whose ministry,
   after an extraordinary manner, was blessed and owned for the conversion
   of many sinners; three thousand were converted under one sermon; the
   savor of Christ's "knowledge was made manifest by them in every place;"
   they bore twins to Christ, and were instrumental in the conversion of
   many, both of Jews and Gentiles; they went forth bearing and sowing the
   precious seed of the gospel; and returned, "bringing their sheaves with
   them," having reaped a glorious harvest: they travailed in birth, till
   Christ "was formed in souls;" and they did not travail in vain, for he
   that brought to the birth, caused to bring forth.

   2dly, Or else by teeth, if applied to particular believers, we may
   understand meditation and faith, by which they feed on divine and
   spiritual things, 1. By meditation a soul feeds on Christ, on his
   person, blood, and righteousness; and finds a pleasure, sweetness, and
   delight therein: it is sometimes, as in Psalm 63:5, 6; satisfied as
   with marrow and fatness, when it remembers Christ upon its bed, and
   meditates on his love and grace in the night-watches; by it a believing
   soul feeds upon the gospel, its truths and promises, and receives much
   refreshment from thence; like Jeremy (Jer. 15:16). it finds the word by
   meditation, and eats it, and it is the joy and rejoicing of its heart.
   Now meditating souls may be very well compared to a flock of sheep,
   which are clean creatures, and chew the cud; for these chew the word of
   grace, and ruminate upon it; and to a flock of sheep even shorn, being
   in some measure rid of the old fleece of vain, carnal, and worldly
   thoughts; and are come up from the washing; being cleansed in some
   measure from the former filthiness and uncleanness of their minds, they
   ascend heavenwards in their thoughts, desires, and affections, which
   they employ by meditating upon pure, spiritual, and heavenly things;
   and such souls are usually fruitful; they are not barren and unfruitful
   in the knowledge of Christ and his gospel; but generally bring forth
   the twins of prayer and praise "meditation fits a man for prayer, and
   fills him with praise; meditating souls are commonly praying and
   praising ones; for whilst they are musing, the fire bums, and then
   speak they with their tongues, either in prayer or praise; it puts them
   either upon praying to God for a mercy, or upon praising him for one.
   2. By faith a soul feeds on Christ and his grace: faith serves a great
   many purposes; it is the soul's eye, by which it sees Christ; and its
   feet, by" which it goes to him; and the hand, by which it receives him
   and lays hold on him; and likewise the teeth, by which it feeds upon
   him: faith is expressed by eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, in
   John 6:56. "he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in
   me, and I in him." An oral, corporal manducation, is not here intended,
   but a spiritual one, which is by faith: faith feeds on Christ, the
   bread of life, and eats that hidden manna, the food of the wilderness,
   lives wholly and entirely on him; which grace is peculiar to Christ's
   sheep, and therefore is called the "faith of God's elect;" and the
   reason why others do not believe and live upon him, is, because they
   are not of Christ's sheep; and though in some persons it is strong, and
   in others weak, yet it is in all alike precious faith in its own
   nature, and to Christ Jesus: these teeth are even, and so fit for
   eating; faith is alike as to its quality in all believers, though not
   as to degree; and, like Judah's teeth, is white with the milk of the
   word, is pure, unfeigned and sincere; and is always fruitful, attended
   with good works; and more especially bears and brings forth those
   twins, love to Christ, and love to the saints; for "faith works by
   love," (Gal. 5:6).

Chapter 4 Verse 3

   Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy
   temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words Christ proceeds to give the fourth and fifth
   instances of the church's beauty; and says,

   I.That her "lips are like a thread of scarlets" etc.

   II.That her "temples are like a piece of a pomegranate."

   I.Her lips are compared to a thread of scarlet. The Targum on this
   place, by eyes, understands the princes and wise men of Israel, who sat
   in the Sanhedrim, and enlightened the world; by the hair, the rest of
   the people of the land, in verse 1. by teeth, in verse 2. the priests
   and Levites, who offered the sacrifices, and eat the holy flesh; and by
   lips here, the lips of the high priest, who (as the Targum expresses
   it) by his prayer on the day of atonement, changed the transgressions
   of the people of Israel, which were like to a thread of scarlet, and
   made them white as wool: It is a received tradition among the Jews
   [464] that when the scapegoat was sent into the wilderness, a scarlet
   thread was tied to the temple-door, and when the goat was come to the
   wilderness, the scarlet thread turned white; which was not only a sign
   of the goat's arrival thither, but also a token to them of the
   remission of their sins, according to Isaiah 1:18. "though your sins be
   as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow:" and they tell us [465]
   that this scarlet thread ceased turning white forty years before the
   destruction of the temple; which was about the time that Christ, the
   great sacrifice for sin, was offered up. R. Aben Ezra thinks, by the
   eyes are meant the prophets, who in scripture are called seers; by the
   hair, the Nazarites; by the teeth, the strong and mighty men; and by
   the lips here, the singers, who sung the high praises of God. R.
   Solomon Jarchi expounds it, of the beauty and comeliness of the lips,
   in making and keeping promises; as the spies did to Rahab the harlot,
   whose token to know her house by, was a line of scarlet.

   Lips are the instruments of speech; and by the church's lips here, are
   meant her words, which the following expression,: and thy speech is
   comely," manifests and confirms; which are compared to a thread of
   scarlet; to a thread for thinness, and to a thread of scarlet for
   color; for these two things, thinness in substance, and redness of
   color, are the beauty of the lips: thin, red lips being beautiful, as
   well as white teeth; so the beautiful Aspasia had red lips [466] and
   teeth whiter than snow; hence we sometimes read of red and purple lips;
   [467] and which were not only expressive of beauty, but of health, and
   of a sound constitution. Now by the church's lips, or words, are meant,
   either,

   1st, Her prayers: Christ's prayers are, in Psalm 21:2. called the
   request of his lips; and so may the church's prayers, and every
   believer's, be called the request of their lips; which may be compared
   to a thread of scarlet, 1. For thinness: The prayers of believers are
   not filled with great swelling words of vanity, but with humble
   confessions of sin; bewailing the corruption and depravity of their
   natures; earnestly imploring views of pardoning grace, and the
   discoveries of God's love to their souls; acknowledging that they are
   unworthy to receive the least mercy and favor at the hand of God, but
   deserve the severest strokes of his justice, and the highest instances
   of his displeasure: they do not address the throne of grace with vanity
   and pride, but with an humble boldness, and oftentimes under a great
   deal of brokenness of soul; being conscious of their own guilt, and
   filled with a sense of God's majesty and greatness; was it not for the
   mediator Christ Jesus, and his precious blood, which is carried within
   the veil, and his spotless righteousness, which they are allowed to
   plead, they durst not presume to approach the divine presence; they do
   not exalt themselves, and magnify their works of righteousness, nor
   extenuate their sins and transgressions, but are silent in the one, and
   frankly acknowledge the other, with all their aggravating
   circumstances; they do not act like the proud Pharisee (Luke 18:11-13),
   who "stood and prayed thus with himself; God, I thank thee, that I am
   not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this
   publican; I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I
   possess;" but like the poor publican, who stood afar off, and "would
   not so much as lift up his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast,
   saying, God be merciful to me a sinner:" the lips of the publican, in
   this prayer, were like to a thread of scarlet, 2. For their constancy,
   and continuance in them: the prayers of believers are like one
   continued thread of scarlet; no sooner are souls born again, but behold
   they. pray; and they continue, or at least ought to continue praying
   souls all their days. Christ spoke a parable to this end, that "men
   ought always to pray, and not to faint," and the apostle (Col. 4:2),
   exhorts believers to "continue in prayer, and watch in the same with
   thanksgiving:" not that it is intended, in these places, that persons
   should always be actually engaged in this duty; but that believers
   should be often at the throne of grace; and when they are there, be
   importunate for the blessing they stand in need of; watch for a return
   of their prayers, and then be as diligent to attend the throne of grace
   with thankfulness; and when this is the common and constant course of a
   believer's life, his lips may be said to be like to a thread of
   scarlet. 3. For the fervency of them: the scarlet color may denote the
   ardency, warmth and fervor of a believer's spirit in prayer; such a
   warm, fervent, praying soul was Jacob, who wrestled with God, and would
   not stir without the blessing, but, "as a prince, had power with God,
   and prevailed;" and such an one was the Syrophaenician woman, who would
   take no denial from Christ; and such an one was Elias (James 5:16-18),
   who prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not; and
   again he prayed that it might rain, and the heavens gave ram; for the
   "effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much:" now when
   believers are thus fervent and importunate in prayer for the mercy or
   blessing they want, then may their lips be said to be like a thread of
   scarlet. 4. Because a believer's prayers are all tinctured with the
   blood of Christ, and so become like a thread of scarlet: they are all
   presented through Christ's mediation, being perfumed with his much
   incense; a believer does not put them up in his own name, but in the
   name of Christ; he pleads not his own worthiness, but the precious
   blood of Christ, and expects that they will meet with acceptance only
   through his mediation. 5. For their acceptableness with God: the
   scarlet color is the best of colors, and most highly esteemed of; the
   prayers of the saints being offered up in faith, and in the name of
   Christ, being presented thro" his mediation, are very acceptable to
   God; they are pleasant music in his ears, and sweet fragrant odors in
   his nostrils; he is so far from despising the prayer of the destitute,
   that he delights and takes pleasure in it; it is like a thread of
   scarlet to him. Or else, by the church's lips, we may understand,

   2dly, Her praises: as prayer is called the request of the lips, so
   praise is called the fruit of the lips (Heb. 13:15), as with our lips
   we pray to God, so with our lips we praise him: and the lips of
   believers in praising, as well as in praying, may be compared to a
   thread of scarlet, 1. They are thin, like a thread of scarlet: they are
   not filled with big, swollen praises of themselves, and of what they
   have done; a believer takes the advice the wise man gives (Prov. 27:2),
   "Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not
   thine own lips:" he does not speak in the commendation of himself, but
   of the goodness and grace of God; he praises him for all temporal
   mercies, for his being, the preservation of it, and for all the mercies
   of life, which make it comfortable; acknowledging that he is not worthy
   of the least of the mercies which God has shewn him; and then his
   praises and thanksgivings rise higher for spiritual ones, for those all
   spiritual blessings, with which he is blessed in heavenly places in
   Christ Jesus: how does he adore, admire, and praise distinguishing love
   and grace, that such a poor, blind, ignorant creature as he, should be
   called out of darkness into marvelous light! that such a guilty wretch
   should be justified by Christ's righteousness from all his sins! That
   such a filthy creature should be washed and cleansed in Christ's blood,
   and have all his iniquities pardoned through the same! that he should
   be adopted into God's family, and be made an heir of God, and a joint
   heir with Christ Jesus! how thankful is he for the gospel and the
   ministers of it, which have brought him the news of, and shewed him the
   way unto life and salvation by Jesus Christ! and, above all, how
   thankful is he for Christ, that unspeakable gift of God's love! Now
   when the lips of believers, in praising, move in such a strain as this,
   then may they he said to be like a thread of scarlet. 2. The praises of
   believers are compared to a thread of scarlet, for the heartiness,
   sincerity, and affection that go along with them; as they draw nigh to
   God with their mouths, and honor him with their lips, so their hearts
   are not far from him; all the while they are praising, the fire of love
   burns within them; their souls are enflamed with it, and their lips
   look. Like scarlet, being touched with a live coal from off God's
   altar. 3. For the acceptableness of them through Christ's mediation:
   our praises, as well as our prayers, must be tinctured with Christ's
   blood; they must be offered up by him; for no other way are these
   sacrifices well pleasing to God, or accepted with him. Or,

   3dly, By her lips may be meant the doctrines of the gospel, delivered
   by her ministers; which are the church's lips, that "drop as an
   honey-comb," and publish the glad tidings of peace, life, and salvation
   to poor souls. Now these doctrines of grace, delivered by them, may be
   compared to "a thread of scarlet," 1. Because they are spun out of the
   scriptures: all scripture being divinely inspired, qeo&gt;pneusov,
   breathed by God, "is profitable for doctrine," as well as for other
   things" it is the fountain from whence all the doctrines of grace
   spring; and the Lydian stone, by which they are all tried; for whatever
   is not according to this "law and testimony," is not to be received:
   hence Christ advises to "search the scriptures," and the noble Bereans
   are commended for doing so. 2. This scarlet thread of the gospel, being
   spun out of the scriptures, is smooth and even; there is an harmony and
   agreement in the truths of the gospel; there is no jar and discord
   among them: this great trumpet does not give an uncertain sound; the
   doctrines of it are not yea and nay, contradictory to one another and
   truth itself, but are all of a piece, like one single "scarlet thread;"
   there is a close connection between them; they are linked and chained
   together, and cannot be separated; they look like, and are answerable
   to one another; there is a proportion or analogy of faith, according to
   which they are all measured. 3. The great subjects of the gospel are
   the blood, death, and sufferings of a crucified Christ; we, says the
   apostle (1 Cor. 1:23), preach Christ crucified:" a crucified Christ was
   the sum and substance of their ministry; therefore the gospel, and the
   doctrines of it, may well be compared to a "scarlet thread:" the chief
   doctrines of the gospel are, that the pardon of sin is procured by
   Christ's blood; that he has made peace and reconciliation for sinners
   by the blood of his cross; that sinners are justified by his blood, and
   so shall be saved from wrath to come; that Christ sanctifies his people
   with his blood, and has by it opened the gates of heaven tot them; that
   it is by that he himself has entered into the holy of holies, and by
   which saints have a right so to do. Now these are the scarlet-colored
   doctrines of the gospel; which, 4. Are valuable, precious, and highly
   to be esteemed of as scarlet; they are comparable to gold, silver, and
   precious stones; which angels desire to look into, and are by saints
   preferred to their necessary food; yea, are dearer to them than their
   lives, or any thing in life; witness the fines, imprisonments, loss of
   goods, racks: tortures, and death itself, which they have voluntarily
   and cheerfully underwent for the sake of it: thus her lips are like "a
   thread of scarlet."

   It is further added, "and thy speech is comely:" which words are
   exegetical of the former; and manifestly shew what is intended by her
   lips, namely, her speech; which is said to be comely, that is,
   graceful, amiable, and to be desired. And so is, 1. A believer's speech
   concerning Christ. When believers speak to others of what Christ is
   unto them; how he is "of God made unto them wisdom, righteousness,
   sanctification and redemption; and of what he has done for them, in
   atoning for their sins, bringing in an everlasting righteousness, and
   saving them from sin, law, death and hell; when they speak of the
   glories of his person, the preciousness and efficacy of his blood, the
   excellency of his righteousness, and completeness of his sacrifice:
   when believers speak "often one to another" of these, "he hearkens and
   hears," listens as it were to hear what they talk of, and puts it down
   in the "book of his remembrance," as being well pleased with it. 2. The
   speech of a believer is graceful and comely to Christ, when they speak
   for him, in vindication of his person, people, truths and ordinances;
   for he says (Matthew 10:32), "whosoever shall confess me before men.
   him will I confess also before my" Father in heaven." 3. The speech of
   a believer to Christ is exceeding grateful and well-pleasing, whether
   it be in prayer or in praise, as has been already shewn; hence Christ
   says, chapter 2:14, "let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice;
   for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely." 4. It may
   intend the gracefulness of a believer's speech in his common
   conversation: it being attended "with grace," "and seasoned with salt,
   ministers grace unto the hearers;" is not infectious, pernicious and
   destructive, as the corrupt and unsavory communication of the wicked
   is; but tends to the pleasure, profit and edification of others.

   II.Her temples are next commended in these words, which is the fifth
   particular instanced in the church's beauty; "thy temples are like a
   piece of a pomegranate within thy locks." R. Aben Ezra interprets these
   words of the priests, who had pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet,
   round about the hem of the ephod which they wore: but the Targum, on
   the place, understands by the temples, the king who was the head of the
   people of Israel, and was fall of good works, as the pomegranate is of
   kernels; and by the locks, the governors and princes, who were next to
   him: but it seems more agreeable, that ecclesiastical officers are here
   intended, whom Christ has placed in his church, to take care of the
   discipline of his house, as well as to maintain and defend the gospel.

   That there is, and ought to be such officers in churches, who have the
   presiding; ruling, governing power therein, not only the nature of
   societies requires, but the scripture also does abundantly confirm,
   more especially the following ones; "Let the elders that rule well be
   counted worthy of double honor, etc. Obey them that have the rule over
   you, etc. He that ruleth with diligence," (1 Tim. 5:17; Heb. 13:17;
   Rom. 12:8). Their work is not only to preach the gospel, and feed the
   flock with wholesome food; but to admonish, warn and rebuke those who
   stand in need thereof; to lay on and take off censures, to open and
   shut the doors of the church, that is, in admission and excommunication
   of members. Now this power is originally in the church, and only
   derivatively in them; they are but the administrators of it, in the
   church's name: they have no despotical, arbitrary, and tyrannical
   power, lodged in their hands, to rule at pleasure; but are limited by
   the taws of Christ, which he has provided for the orderly government of
   his house, which they are to see put into execution. Now these may be
   called,

   First, The church's temples.

   1st, The temples are called, in the Hebrew tongue, by a word [468]
   which signifies thinness and tenderness; because the temples have but
   little flesh upon them, and are covered only with a thin skin; which
   may teach us, 1. That those persons who are called to such a work and
   office in Christ's house, though it cannot otherwise be but they must
   have flesh as well as spirit in them, being men of like passions and
   affections with others; yet these more especially Ought not to live in
   and walk after the flesh; there should be a less appearance of
   carnality in them, and a greater discovery of. spiritual-mindedness,
   and of the life and power of godliness in their conversations;
   therefore the apostle is very particular in giving their characters (1
   Tim. 3:1-7; Titus 1:6-9). 2. It may also teach us, that there ought to
   be it great deal of tenderness in them, and used by them in the
   discharge of their work; for in so doing, they are like to be most
   successful: admonitions and reproofs for sin, mildly and tenderly
   given, are often kindly taken; they are like "an excellent oil, which
   does not break the head," but wins the heart: tender-heartedness is
   requisite in all Christians, but more especially in officers of
   churches, who are to deal as tenderly with persons, as surgeons do in
   dressing wounds, or in setting broken or dislocated bones; hence the
   apostle, in Galatians 6:1 uses a metaphor taken from them, "you that
   are spiritual restore," katarti&gt;zete, joint in, or set in joint
   again, "such an one in the spirit of meekness;" though it is true, in
   some cases sharpness is to be used; as when there is a gangrene in a
   member, which endangers the body, there must be a cutting off, an
   amputation of the member; so persons, when all means have been tried
   for their recovery and restoration, and there is no reclaiming them
   from an error in doctrine or practice; they are not only to be rebuked
   sharply, but to be cut off from the body, the church.

   2dly, The temples are called in Greek, kro&gt;tafov [469] from the
   evident beating of the pulse there: now as a person's constitution may
   be judged of by the beating of his pulse; so may the constitution of a
   church by her temples, the officers, in their administration of
   affairs: if church discipline is neglected, and Christ's laws are not
   put in execution against delinquents, the church is in a bad state and
   in an unhealthful and declining condition; and on the contrary, when
   officers are lively, zealous and diligent in their work, and all things
   are kept in a just order and decorum, the church is then in an
   healthful and flourishing condition.

   3dly, The temples are placed between the eyes and the ears; and church
   officers being called so teaches us that they have need of both in
   managing the affairs of Christ's house. Christ indeed, being God
   omniscient, "shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither
   reprove after the hearing of his ears;" but we have no other way of
   judging than by the sight of our eyes, and by the hearing of our ears,
   and therefore both are to be employed: the ears of the church-officers
   are to be open, without respect of persons, to rich and poor, high and
   low; they are to hear complaints and charges exhibited, if introduced
   in a regular manner, and then the evidence to support these complaints
   and charges; they must also hear the answers of the person or persons
   accused and complained of, and must not shut their eyes against clear
   light and plain evidence.

   Secondly, These temples are said to be "within the locks;" under locks
   of hair plaited and curled about them; expressive both of secrecy and
   beauty: which may teach us, 1. That admonitions, in case of private
   offenses, ought to be given privately, according to that golden rule
   given by our Lord (Matthew 18:15-17), "If thy brother shall trespass
   against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone;"
   let no one know it before thou hast told him, and let none be with thee
   when thou dost; "if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother;"
   therefore for ever after never speak of it to others, nor upbraid him
   with it; "but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
   more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be
   established; and if he shall neglect to hear them," matters being thus
   prepared, "tell it unto the church;" and then thou shalt have witnesses
   to support and make good thy allegations. This rule is so plain and
   easy, that one would think, none could mistake or go aside from it; and
   was it but closely adhered to, would prevent a great deal of scandal
   and reproach that is cast upon religion, as well as a great many
   disturbances, occasioned in churches by the neglect of it: and in so
   doing, the church's temples, in this branch of the administration of
   discipline, may be said to be within her locks; though it is true, in
   case of public offenses, admonitions and rebukes are to be given
   publicly, that "others may fear," (1 Tim. 5:20). 2. It may also teach
   us, that all the affairs and concerns of churches ought to be kept
   private, and not blazed about in the world; their debates and
   determinations ought not to be told to other churches, unless there is
   a necessity for it; much less told in Gath, and published in the
   "streets of Askelon;" for every particular church should be as a
   "garden enclosed, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed," (Song 4:12). 3.
   The temples being within the locks, may denote the humility of
   church-officers in their work; they lie hid under the hair, the rest of
   believers; they do not rise up above them, though they are taller and
   higher than they are in gifts and grace, as well as by virtue of their
   office and station in the church; yet they are, in their own esteem,
   "less than the least of all saints:" they do not assume to themselves a
   domination and lordly power "over God's heritage;" they. do not impose
   their sentiments upon churches for final determinations in cases; but
   humbly submit themselves, preferring the judgment of the church to
   their own private ones; they be.. come "all things to all, that they
   may save some." 4. May be expressive of the beauty of
   church-discipline: that church appears very beautiful, like the
   "temples within the locks," where the gospel is faithfully preached,
   the ordinances purely administered, and the laws of Christ's house
   strictly regarded. Believers, who walk together in the order, as well
   as in the faith of the gospel, appear very beautiful, stately, and
   magnificent to spectators: they are "like a company, of horses in
   Pharaoh's chariot;" or like a garden, with a variety of flowers, well
   weeded and taken care of; or an "orchard of pomegranates," well dressed
   and managed: on the contrary, a church, in which no regard is had to
   order and discipline, is like "the field of the slothful, and the
   vineyard of the man void of understanding," which is all overrun "with
   thorns and nettles," its fence and stone-wall being broken down."

   Thirdly, These temples are said to be "like a piece of a pomegranate;
   not of the tree, but of the fruit, the shell or rind being broken; so
   the Septuagint render it. [470] The land of Canaan was a land of
   pomegranates; they grew there in great plenty, and therefore are
   frequently mentioned in this Song.

   1st, The fruit, when the shell, or rind is broken, appears to be full
   of grains or kernels, and therefore is a pomegranate: and it is the
   nature of this fruit, that if it hangs long on the tree after it is
   fully ripe, it will burst and open of itself, [471] and its kernels
   will become visible: one of the mansions of the Israelites is called by
   them Rimmon-parez, Numbers 33:19, the pomegranate of rupture, or the
   burstened pomegranate, where probably they found such. And the church's
   temples are said to be like to such a burstened and broken piece of a
   pomegranate, that is full of kernels, and visible; because those who
   are called to such work and office in the church, as has been
   mentioned, should be men "full of the Holy Ghost," as Stephen was; they
   should be as full of the gifts and graces of the Spirit, as the
   pomegranate is of kernels, that they may be capable of discharging the
   work aright: Christ knows full well that they stand in need of such,
   and therefore, as he has "received gifts for men," so he "gives them to
   men;" to qualify them for the work of the ministry, and for the
   well-ordering and governing of his churches; and yet, notwithstanding
   all that they receive, they are obliged to say, with the apostle, "Who
   is sufficient for these things?" And as they should be men full of the
   Spirit, so likewise full of good works; and these visible to men, even
   as the kernels of a burstened pomegranate; [472] their "light should
   shine before men;" they should have a good report of them that are
   without, and be examples to those that are within; and when they are
   so, then may the church's temples be said to be "like a piece of a
   pomegranate within her locks." Also the pomegranate, when broken,
   appearing to be full of kernels, all set in a beautiful order, and
   joined to each other, may be expressive of that union, harmony, and
   consent of church-members, with their officers, in acts of discipline;
   censures are laid and taken off, members are received or rejected, not
   by some single person or persons, but by the joint consent and
   unanimous voice of the whole church.

   2dly, As this fruit is full of kernels, so, when broken, there springs
   from it a reddish, purple, sweet and delightful juice hence you read of
   the "juice of the pomegranate," chapter 8:2, which the church would
   cause Christ to drink of; and nothing is more delightful in Christ's
   eye, odoros to his smell, and sweet to his taste, than this juice of
   the pomegranate is; namely, a pure administration of his ordinances,
   and a strict regard and close adherence to the laws of his house; nay,
   even to believers themselves, result from hence pleasure, delight and
   satisfaction.

   3dly, The fruit of the pomegranate is very useful in medicine. 1. For
   repressing the heat of choler, and malignity of fevers. [473] God's
   children too often fall out by the way; there are frequently
   differences and divisions among them: many of them are of hot, fiery
   and choleric dispositions; do not know "what spirits they are of," and
   at every turn are, like the disciples, for calling "for fire from
   heaven" upon those who have disobliged them. Now officers in churches
   are like a peace of a pomegranate; they allay and repress these heats,
   by wholesome advice and proper admonitions; they are instruments in
   making peace, and reconciling differing brethren; and either remove the
   causes of contention, or else, with the consent of the church, remove
   those who are the causes of these divisions and contentions. 2. For
   stopping the fluxes of the belly: [474] the pomegranate is of an
   astringent nature, the kernels bind more that, the juice, and the shell
   or find more than either; the officers of churches are useful in
   putting a stop to loose and disorderly practices, by warning,
   admonishing, rebuking, or withdrawing from those who walk disorderly.
   3. For comforting the stomach and bowels: [475] so these officers
   comfort the children of God; for as they "warn the unruly, so they
   comfort the feeble-minded, and support the weak," by directing them to
   the person, blood, righteousness, and. fullness of Christ Jesus; by
   delivering the sweet doctrines) and opening the precious promises of
   the gospel.

   Thus church-officers, in managing the affairs of Christ's house, in
   conjunction with his church, may be called her temples, which are "like
   a piece of a pomegranate within her locks;" or her veil [476] as some
   render at; so Symmacchus, covered with a veil, as her eyes were, verse
   1. and here her cheeks; and so the Septuagint render the word in Isaiah
   47:2; such veils, covering those parts, were wore by women in the
   eastern countries) expressive of their modesty; and what was latent,
   and much out of sight, seemed more beautiful. Likewise the temples,
   taken in a large signification, not only intend that part of the face,
   between the ears and eyes) and upwards, but include the cheeks also;
   and so the Septuagint [477] translate the word here: the purple juice
   of the pomegranate well expresses the color of them, which is their
   beauty; hence we often read of purple cheeks as beautiful [478] a
   pomegranate cut affords a very agreeable resemblance of a beautiful
   cheek; and in Talmudic language, as Jarchi observes the cheeks are
   called ypad ynmwr the pomegranates of the face. And these being
   compared to "a piece of pomegranate within her locks," may denote her
   modesty, shamefacedness, and beauty. 1. Her modesty: the cheeks are the
   seat thereof, and being within her locks, give the greater evidence of
   it. The church of Christ, or believers, are very humble and modest;
   they think the worst of themselves and the best of others, and so take
   the apostle's advice (Phil. 2:3). "Let each esteem other better than
   themselves:" they are apt to think every saint has more grace and less
   sin and corruption in him than they have, and esteem themselves the
   least of saints and the chief of sinners; they frankly acknowledge that
   all they have, and all they are, is owing to the grace of God; that
   whatsoever they have, either of nature or grace, whether temporal or
   spiritual, they have received from him; and whatever they are, they say
   it is by the grace of God they are what they are; they do not envy the
   gifts and grace of God, which are bestowed on others, but could wish,
   with Moses (Num. 11:29), that "all the Lord's people were prophets;"
   yet they could be glad of more themselves, and are not puffed up with
   what they have, and therefore are far from despising others who are
   inferior to them; they are willing to be instructed by, and receive
   admonition from the meanest saint: they are very sparing in speaking of
   themselves; like their dear Lord, their "voice is not heard in the
   street;" and, when they do open their mouths, it is not in commendation
   of themselves and their own righteousness; but in lamenting the
   depravity and pollution of their nature; in acknowledging the
   imperfection of their obedience, and that when they have done all they
   can, they are but unprofitable servants. 2. Her shamefacedness and
   blushing; which is elegantly set forth by the broken piece of the shell
   or rind of the pomegranate, tinctured with the red and purple juice
   thereof: a believer oftentimes blushes before God under a sense of sin,
   and especially when committed against love, grace and mercy; thus we
   read of Ezra, in Ezra 9:6. that he was "ashamed and blushed to lift up
   his face to God, because that grace had been shewed them from him; and
   he had left them a remnant to escape, and had given them a nail in his
   holy place, and had extended mercy to them in the sight of the kings of
   Persia;" and yet, after all this, they had forsaken his commandment: it
   is this which cuts and grieves a believer's heart, and fills his face
   with shame and confusion; and never more is he put to the blush, than
   when he views sin in the glass of pardoning grace and pacifying love,
   according to Ezekiel 16:63. "That thou mayest remember, and be
   confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame,
   when I am pacified towards thee;" then are their checks like a piece of
   a pomegranate within their locks, or under a veil; they blush when no
   eye Sees them, and for that which none ever saw or could charge them
   with: and whenever they are charged with or reproved for sin, they have
   not a brow of brass to outface the charge, but soon discover their
   consciousness of guilt by the blushing of their countenance. Moreover,
   whenever they cast their eyes upon their own righteousness, they are
   ashamed of it, it being nothing but filthy rags, and "as an unclean
   thing;" and oftentimes, when they come into Christ's" presence, not
   having that holy boldness and confidence of faith in him, they hang
   their heads, and dare not so much as lift up their eyes to him;
   wherefore he says to them, as in chapter 2:14. "Let me see thy
   countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy
   countenance is comely;" and that in order to remove their fears, cheer
   their souls, and encourage their faith. 3. Her beauty: when a
   pomegranate is broken, there appears a reddish juice, like blood, as
   Pausanius [479] remarks; interspread between the white kernels, which
   gives a lively idea of her beauty; she being, as she says of her
   beloved, "white-and ruddy," and so a perfection of beauty: her modest
   dress and blushing looks; her temples or cheeks being within her locks,
   or under a veil; and these like a piece of a pomegranate, made her
   extremely beautiful in Christ's eye. Modest and humble souls he fixes
   his eye on, and delights to dwell with; to these he will give more
   grace, and will beautify them yet more with his salvation.

Chapter 4 Verse 4

   Thy neck is like the tower of David, builded for an armory;
   whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word this verse Christ proceeds to give a sixth instance of the
   church's beauty, and compares her neck to the tower of David, etc. The
   Targum, by her neck, understands the "chief of the session, or great
   council," who, for his works and worthiness, was like David king of
   Israel: R. Aben Ezra expounds it of the king, and the bucklers and
   shields of the princes: R. Solomon Jarchi interprets the neck of the
   chambers of hewn stone, where the great council sat, which, he says,
   was the strength and fortress of Israel; the bucklers or shields, the
   law, which is a shield or buckler to Israel, which God hath commanded
   to a thousand generations: and others of the Jewish writers [480]
   think, that by the neck, the house of the sanctuary or temple is
   intended. Though rather, by the church's neck are meant, either,

   First, The ministers of the gospel; who, 1. As the neck, are placed
   next the head, in the more eminent part of the body, they are set above
   the rest of the members; but yet in subjection to Christ, the head;
   they are fixed between the head and the body, and are ruled by the one,
   and govern the other; but with no other laws but what are given forth
   by the head. 2. As the neck, they are adorned with chains of gold which
   are the gifts and graces of the Spirit; which, in a variety, are given
   to them, to make them both beautiful and useful in the place wherein
   they are set. 3. As the neck joins to the head, so they hold to the
   head, Christ Jesus, and nothing can separate them from him; the
   flatteries and allurements of the world cannot draw them; nor its
   terrors, reproaches and persecutions, drive them from Christ; but they
   still espouse his cause, vindicate his person, preach his gospel, and
   hold fast their profession, though it be with the peril of their lives.
   4. As the neck, they bear up and support the head. that is, the name,
   cause, and interest of Christ Jesus; so the apostle Paul is said to be
   "a chosen vessel, to bear Christ's name among the Gentiles," Acts 9:15,
   and Pselles, an ancient writer, thinks that he is here particularly
   meant. 5. As the neck joins the body to the head, so they bring souls
   near to Christ who are afar off; and that by preaching "peace to them
   that were afar off, and to lead them that are nigh:" they shew souls
   the way of salvation, and direct them to a crucified Christ; they woo
   and beseech them, and are the instruments of espousing them to him. 6.
   As the neck is the means of conveying food to the body; so they are the
   means of conveying spiritual food to souls from Christ: all spiritual
   food and nourishment is derived to the members from Christ, the head;
   and very frequently, through the ministry of the word: Christ gives his
   ministering servants light, knowledge, and understanding in gospel
   truths, that they may feed others therewith; he breaks the bread of
   life, and gives it to them, that they may give to every one their
   portion; as he took the loaves, and distributed to his disciples, and
   they to the multitude. Now this neck of the church may be compared to
   the tower of David.

   The tower of David [481] was either the strong hold of Zion, which he
   took from the Jebusites, and rebuilt; or some other tower, erected by
   him for an armoury, wherein his worthies or mighty men hung up their
   shields; such an one as the house of the forest of Lebanon, afterwards
   built by Solomon, was, where he put two hundred targets, and three
   hundred shields, all made of beaten gold; and therefore mention is made
   in Isaiah 22:8 of "the armor of the house of the forest." Now the
   ministers of the gospel may be compared to David's tower: the Lord says
   of Jeremy (Jer. 6:27), "I have set thee for a tower and for a fortress
   among my people." (1.) They may be compared to the tower of David for
   its height; towers are usually built very high, and, no doubt, this
   tower of David's was built so; Mr. Sandys [482] says, it stood aloft in
   the utmost angle of a mountain, whose ruins are yet extant ministers
   are set in the highest post and place in Christ's house; are called
   with the high calling of God, to the greatest work therein, and are
   endowed with the largest measures of gifts and graces for it, and ought
   to be highly esteemed of for their works" sake. (2.) For its erectness;
   towers are built erect, and for this reason the neck is compared to
   one; the beauty of the neck consisting in its straightness and
   uprightness; which may set forth the integrity and uprightness of
   ministers, both in doctrine and conversation: as Christ has counted
   them faithful, and put them into the ministry, and has put the word of
   reconciliation into their hands, so they will not let it go; but will
   hold fast the faithful word, whatever it cost them, or whatever be the
   consequence of it: moreover, they are as careful to hold it forth in
   their lives, and to exercise a flood conscience void of offense, both
   towards God and man. (3.) For its strength: towers, as they are built
   high and upright, so they are usually built strong; and no doubt but
   this tower of David's was: the ministers of the gospel, like towers,
   are strong and immoveable, cannot be easily moved away from the hope of
   the gospel; bonds and imprisonment will not move them, nor death itself
   scare them from it; but, like strong towers and walls of brass, they
   stand the batteries of Satan and the world. (4.) Towers were built for
   defense, and so perhaps was this of David's; ministers of the gospel
   are set for the defense of it; and they have been enabled so well to do
   it, that it has not been in the power of the enemy hitherto to take and
   destroy it. (5.) Sometimes they are built to watch in; thus we read of
   a watch tower, in Habakkuk 2:1 ministers of the gospel are represented
   as watchmen, whose work is to give warning of, and to prevent
   approaching danger, and to watch over and for the souls of men. (6.)
   This tower of David was built for an armory [483] on which were hung a
   thousand bucklers, etc. this may intend that furniture which ministers
   have for their work; and that panopli&gt;a, or whole armor of God,
   which they are supplied with out of the scriptures, to defend the
   gospel against all opposers. And so,

   Secondly, By the church's neck, which is compared to "the tower of
   David," may be understood also the scriptures of truth; which, 1. As
   the neck is joined to the head, and being erect, discovers and makes it
   conspicuous; so the scriptures being near to Christ, point him out,
   lead and direct souls unto him; they hold him forth, and discover him
   to them; and therefore Christ exhorts us (John 5:39) to, "search the
   scriptures," and for our encouragement declares, that they testify of
   him. 2. They are the means of conveying spiritual breath to souls: the
   words which Christ speaks, and when he speaks them to the soul, "they
   are spirit, and they are life;" and when attend. ed with an almighty
   power, they make "dry bones live," and become the "savor of life unto
   life" to dead sinners. 3. They are the means of conveying spiritual
   food, as well as spiritual breath; as through the neck our breath is
   drawn, and food communicated to us, so through the scriptures we have
   spiritual breath and spiritual food; they supply us with that which is
   nourishing and satisfying, delightful and pleasant, sweeter than the
   "honey or the honey comb." 4. As the neck is beautified with chains of
   gold; so are the scriptures bespangled with glorious truths and
   precious promises, where every truth is a golden link, and every
   promise a pearl, to a believing soul.

   Now this neck of the church, the sacred scriptures, may very justly be
   represented by "the tower of David," (1.) For height: the scriptures
   are an high tower; the truths and doctrines contained therein are
   sublime; they are out of sight, beyond the a each, and above the
   capacity of a natural man; they are things which the carnal eye hath
   not seen, the carnal-heart cannot conceive of, and which are only
   known, judged, valued, and esteemed by the spiritual man, to whom the
   Spirit of God has revealed these deep things; for there are heights and
   depths in the sacred volumes, which require an eagle's eye and an
   angel's heart. (2.) For strength, firmness, and immoveableness: Satan
   and his emissaries nave used all their art and cunning, and employed
   all their power and might to remove the scripture out of the world; but
   they have found it "a burdensome stone" unto them; "the gates of hell"
   and earth have not been able to" prevail against it;" it has stood, and
   ever will, immoveable as a rock, and impregnable as a tower. (3.) It is
   like David's tower, "built for an armory, whereon hang a thousand
   bucklers, all shields of mighty men." From hence are saints furnished
   with spiritual armor, [1.] To repel Satan's temptations: when that
   enemy of souls set upon Christ in the wilderness, and threw his fiery
   darts and poisoned arrows at him; he defended himself, and vanquished
   the enemy with bucklers and shields, and the like pieces of armor taken
   out of his armory; he repelled and weakened the force of his
   temptations, by saying, at every assault of the tempter, "It is
   written," so or so: and thus likewise believers are enabled to do more
   or less; there is no better weapon to engage with that enemy than "the
   sword of the spirit, which is the word of God;" neither is there a
   better storehouse, and magazine of spiritual armor, than the scriptures
   be; the reason why those young men, in 1 John 2:14, are said to
   "overcome the wicked one" is, because the word of God abode in them.
   [2.] To defend the gospel, and refute erroneous doctrines: thus Christ
   refuted the errors of the Pharisees concerning the law, and of the
   Sadducees concerning the resurrection from the dead, and proved the
   spirituality of the one, and confirmed the truth of the other by
   scripture testimonies: so Paul and Apollos mightily convinced the Jews,
   and proved from the scriptures, that Jesus was the Christ, the true
   Messiah; for, as in 2 Timothy 3:16, 17. "All scripture is given by
   inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
   correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God,"
   every believer, and more especially a minister of Christ, "may be
   perfect, thoroughly furnished to every good work;" and particularly to
   defend truth, and refute error, for which he may be abundantly supplied
   out of this armory; for here "hang a thousand bucklers," and these are
   "all shields of mighty" men;" which mighty men may use, and by which
   they may perform mighty actions, and do great exploits.

   Thirdly, By the church's neck, which as compared to the tower of
   David," we may also understand the grace of faith; and, 1. As the neck
   is united to the head and members, so believers, being united to
   Christ, lay hold upon him by faith, and closely adhere to him; by faith
   Christ dwells in our hearts, and by faith we dwell in him, being one
   with him. 2. It bears up and exalts the head; there is no grace which
   brings that glory to Christ, and honors him, as this does; it is a
   soul-emptying, self-abasing, and Christ-exalting grace. 3. Through it
   are conveyed, and by it are derived from Christ, the head, all life,
   food, and nourishment to our souls; it is by faith we live on Christ,
   and receive life, and the comfortable supplies of it; all food and
   nourishment comes from Christ, the head, which faith receives and
   conveys unto us. 4. It is adorned with other graces and good works; the
   other grace of the Spirit, such as hope, fear, love, humility,
   patience, self-denial, etc. are like chains of gold about this neck;
   besides, there are also the fruits of righteousness which attend it,
   and make it look very beautiful and amiable. 5. It is like to the neck
   for erectness; it looks not downwards, but upwards to Christ, who is
   "the author and finisher" of it; it is attended with an humble
   boldness, an holy confidences and a becoming cheerfulness.

   This may now be compared to "the tower of David, (1.) For its height:
   the author of this grace of faith is the most high God; it has its
   original from above; its object is Christ, who is "made higher than the
   heavens;" and to him it looks, on him it lives, in him it dwells; and
   is still pressing on toward "the mark, for the prize of the high
   calling of God in Christ Jesus." (2.) It is like a tower builded for an
   armory: faith is the believer's defense, his buckler and shield,
   whereby he is enabled "to quench the fiery darts" of Satan; faith makes
   use of God as its shield, being encouraged so to do, by the declaration
   of grace made to Abraham, Genesis 15:1. "Fear not, I am thy shield, and
   thy exceeding great reward." Faith improves and makes use of every
   perfection in God, as a shield, his love, grace, power, faithfulness,
   etc. faith makes use of all God's promises as such; there is never a
   promise in the gospel, but will serve for a buckler and shield for
   faith, which believers, at one time or another, have also used as such;
   but more especially, faith uses Christ as such, who is the believer's
   sun and shield, and will give grace and glory to them, and will
   withhold no good thing from them: Christ indeed, rather than faith, is
   a storehouse and magazine of armor, whereon hang a thousand bucklers;
   in whom an inexhaustible, overflowing, and all-sufficient fullness of
   grace dwells: from whence faith is furnished with all sorts of graces
   and every needful piece of spiritual armor.

   and derivation of it. Some, as R. Aben Ezra observes, take it to be a
   compound word, of hlt to hang, and twyp mouths or edges, that is, of
   swords; and so suppose this tower to be built to hang up swords in;
   which agrees well enough with our translation, and with Junius and
   Tremellius's version. who render the word, ad armaria. Others think,
   that it is compounded of lt an heap, and twyp mouths, edges, or

Chapter 4 Verse 5

   Why two breasts are like two young roes that are twins,
   which feed among the lilies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words contain the seventh and last particular instance of
   the church's beauty; in which her breasts are compared to "two young
   roes," very elegantly expressing the beauty of them; they are compared
   to "two young roes" for smallness, large breasts not being accounted
   handsome; to "young does that are twins," because they are of equal
   size and bigness, not one larger and higher than the other, for that
   would be a deformity; and to "two young roes that feed among the
   lilies." which are fat and plump, and so web expresses the fullness of
   them, they being not dry and empty breasts: such are sometimes called
   sororiantes [484] as if they were sisters, being alike; and full and
   distended with milk, reach and join to, and as it were kiss each other
   as such; or, "two fawns, the twins of a doe:" providence, as Plutarch
   [485] observes, has given to women two breasts, that, should they have
   twins, both might have a fountain of nourishment, and though the hind,
   for the most part, brings but one roe at a time; yet the philosopher
   observes [486] there are some that bring twins. Now by the church's
   breasts, we may understand either,

   First, The ministers of the gospel. The Targum here makes mention of
   the Jews two Messiahs; which is a Talmudic fiction, and shews the work
   to be a later one than what is pretended: the words are thus
   paraphrased in it; "Thy two redeemers which shall redeem thee, Messiah
   the son of David, and Messiah the son of Ephraim, are like to Moses and
   Aaron, the sons of Jochebed, who are compared to two young toes that
   are twins; who, in their integrity, fed the people, the house of
   Israel, forty years in the wilderness, with manna and fatted fowls, and
   water of the well of Miriam." And agreeable to this paraphrase, other
   Jewish, writers [487] would have Moses and Aaron here intended, who
   suckled and fed the people of Israel, and as twins, were very like one
   another. But I think they may be much better applied to the ministers
   of the gospel; who impart the "sincere milk of the word" to persons;
   deliver the sweet, comfortable, and nourishing, doctrines of grace;
   which may be compared to milk out of the breasts, with which they feed
   them, as the apostles says (1 Cor. 3:2), "I have fed you with milk;"
   which is nourishing to new-born souls, suitable to their natures, and
   easily" digested by them. Now these breasts of the church, the
   ministers of the gospel, may be compared,

   1st, To two young does, which are, 1. Loving and pleasant creatures;
   "let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe," (etc., Prov. 5:19),
   ministers of the gospel are loving and affection. ate to such souls
   more especially who are born again under their ministry, whom they feed
   with the milk of the word; they are as fond of them, and bear as great
   an affection to them, as the tender mother or nurse do to their sucking
   babes, according to what the apostle says (1 Thess. 2:7, 8). "But we
   were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children; so
   being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted
   unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because
   ye were dear to us;" than which nothing can be more passionately
   spoken, nor in a more lively manner represent that strong affection and
   tender love and regard that ministers shew to souls: moreover as they
   are as the loving hind unto those souls, so they are as the pleasant
   roe in their esteem; they love them, and are loved by them; they appear
   exceeding beautiful and lovely in the eyes of those to whom God has
   made them useful; for the very feet of them that bring glad tidings are
   beautiful to them. 2. Those creatures are sharp-sighted ones; ministers
   of the gospel, having their understandings opened, their judgments
   informed, and their souls led by the Spirit of God, into "the truth, as
   it is in Jesus," have light, knowledge and penetration into the
   scriptures of truth, and are capable of directing and guiding the feet
   of, and shewing the way of salvation unto others. 3. They are swift
   creatures: thus the apostles and first ministers of the gospel, like
   young roes, ran, spread, and carried the gospel all over the Gentile
   world; "their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the
   end of the world:" and it may also denote in general, how expedite and
   quick of dispatch ministers are in doing of their Lord's work,
   notwithstanding a great many difficulties are in the way; yet, like
   young toes, they leap over these mountains, and skip over these hills,
   and are" not slothful in business, but fervent in spirit, serving the
   Lord." 4. Here is only mention made of two young roes, and that to suit
   with the number of her breasts; and two breasts being sufficient for
   one person, denotes the sufficient number of ministers which Christ
   provides for his church: when he had sent out the twelve apostles, he
   afterwards sent out other seventy disciples, and these he sent out "two
   and two;" and so in all ages of the world, as he has removed some, he
   has sent others, and when there has been want of such workmen in his
   vineyard, he has prayed "the Lord of the harvest" to send forth more
   laborers; and as the fruit of his ascension and intercession,
   sufficient gifts have been given to a competent number of men to fit
   them for the ministry, for the good of his body, the church.

   2dly, They are compared, not only to two young roes, but two young roes
   that are twins; which is expressive of their equal authority, joint
   commission, and harmony of doctrine, as has been already observed on
   verse 2.

   3dly, They are compared to two young toes that "feed among the lilies;
   the lilies of the field," for such there were (Matthew 6:28), and we
   sometimes read of harts and hinds being among lilies [488] Now the
   lilies, among which the ministers of the gospel feed, are either, 1.
   The scriptures, which they make their principal study, and the main
   subject of their contemplation; here their own souls are delighted,
   comforted and instructed, and so become useful in comforting and
   instructing others; from hence they gather food for themselves, and
   being nourished with the wholesome words of faith and sound doctrine,
   they are capable of feeding others also. Or, 2. The saints: in what
   respects the people of God may be compared to lilies, has been shewn on
   chapter 2:2. among these the ministers of the gospel feed, and to these
   they break and impart the bread of life. 3. It may be observed, that it
   is where Christ himself feeds, as in chapter 2:16. The ministers of the
   gospel feed where Christ feeds, and Christ feeds where they do: the
   great end of the gospel-ministry is, not only that saints may have
   communion one with another, but also with their head, Christ Jesus:
   Would any therefore enjoy communion with Christ? Are any desirous of
   knowing where Christ feeds? he feeds where his ministers do, and that
   is among the lilies, in the congregation of the saints; it may serve
   then as a direction to such, to sit under a gospel-ministry. Or,

   Secondly, We may understand by the church's two breasts, the two
   Testaments, the Old and the New: A Jewish writer [489] would have their
   two laws here intended, namely, the written law, and the oral law; the
   written law is that which was written on the two tables of stone; the
   oral law is what they imagine God gave to Moses by word of mouth, which
   he gave to Joshua, and so was handed down from one to another, and
   makes up the volume of their vain, unprofitable, and numerous
   traditions, called the Misnah: but it is much better applied by another
   of them [490] to the two tables themselves, on which were written the
   ten commandments, five on one table, and five on the other; and so,
   like two young roes that are twins, answered one another: though the
   two Testaments, the Old and the New, seem to bid much fairer to be the
   sense of these words; which two breasts contain and impart the whole
   "sincere milk of the word," and afford every thing that is nourishing
   and refreshing to believers; here is milk for babes, and meat for
   strong men; and, like "two young roes," are exceeding pleasant and
   delightful to believers; they rejoice the heart, cheat the spirits, and
   fill the soul with an universal pleasure; and as two young roes that
   are twins are alike, there is an harmony and agreement between them:
   they look to one another as the two cherubim over the mercy-seat did.
   They agree, 1. In the person, office, and grace of Christ: the
   Old-Testament has said nothing concerning the Messiah, what he should
   be, do or suffer, but what the New Testament has fully confirmed and
   more clearly discovered: and the New. Testament says nothing of Christ,
   his person, office and grace, but what the Old bears a testimony to;
   and therefore, says Christ to the Jews (John 5:39), "search the
   scriptures," that is, of the Old Testament; "for they are they which
   testify of me." 2. They are alike in their doctrines; the doctrines
   concerning Christ's person, the remission of sins by his blood,
   justification by his righteousness, etc. are the same in both
   Testaments, notwithstanding they were spoken at sundry times," and
   delivered in" divers manners;" though perhaps they are more clearly
   revealed in the one than in the other: the apostle Paul, that great
   asserter of the doctrines of grace under the New Testament, said no
   other firings than what Moses and the prophets said under the Old. 3.
   The promises and prophecies of the Old-Testament have their completion
   in the New; there was nothing promised to be done, or prophesied that
   should be, but what has been exactly fulfilled and brought to pass;
   neither is there scarcely any thing in the New Testament, but what was
   promised and prophesied of under the Old. 4. The types and figures of
   the old law are exactly answered in the New-Testament: the law was
   nothing else but a "shadow of good things to come;" the passover-lamb,
   the brazen serpent, the rock and manna, the Jewish sabbaths,
   sacrifices, new moon, washings and purifications, all prefigured and
   had their fulfillment in Christ Jesus. there is scarce any thing in the
   New-Testament, but what was typified under the Old; and nothing
   prefigured under the Old, but what has its completion in the New; and
   thus are they like two young roes that are twins: and they may also be
   said to be like roes that "feed among the lilies," because they abound
   with the lilies of gospel promises and gospel-doctrines; these two
   fields are full of them; there are "exceeding great and, precious
   promises," and heavenly and delightful truths, which make for the
   consolation, edification, and instruction of God's people. Or,

   Thirdly, By the church's two breasts may be intended, the two
   ordinances of the gospel, baptism, and the Lord's supper; which are not
   dry breasts, but the breasts of consolation, out of which believers
   suck and are satisfied; in the Lord's supper, by faith they "eat the
   flesh," and "drink the blood" of the Son of God, and feed upon the
   bruised and broken body of a crucified Jesus, and in so doing, receive
   much strength and nourishment; in the ordinance of baptism, they look
   to a buried and risen Jesus, behold the place where their Lord lay,
   "who was delivered for their offenses, and rose again for their
   justification;" and oftentimes go away, as the eunuch did, rejoicing:
   now these, like "two young roes," are exceeding pleasant and delightful
   to believers, when they have the presence and Spirit of God with them,
   and the discoveries of his love unto them; for then are wisdom's ways,
   "ways of pleasantness, and all her paths, paths of peace." Again, like
   two roes that are twins, they are both instituted by Christ, both lead
   the faith of God's children to him; they both require the same
   subjects, namely, believers, and ought to go inseparably together; he
   that has a right to the one, has an indubitate right to the other; and
   he that subjects to the one, should also to the other; for so did the
   first primitive Christians, who, as soon as converted, were baptized,
   and the same day joined themselves to the church, and steadfastly
   continued in holy fellowship and communion with it; a practice to be
   imitated and followed by us now. Moreover, these may be said to "feed
   among the lilies," because they are all acknowledged, received, and
   submitted to by the saints, who are compared to lilies; who not only
   entertain them, but maintain and vindicate them against all opposers.

   There are some [491] who think by the church's breasts are meant, love
   to God, and love to our neighbor, which are the two great commandments
   of the law; and therefore love is avid to be the "fulfilling of the
   law." Now "we love God, because he first loved us," and we love the
   saints, because they are loved with the same love, redeemed by the same
   blood as we are, have the same grace wrought in their hearts; as we
   ourselves have, and all as the fruit and effect of divine grace; and
   being thus filled with a sense of God's love, they become very fruitful
   in good works, and, like "two young roes," are exceeding pleasant and
   delightful to Christ; and therefore he says, in verse 10: "How fair is
   my love, my sister, my spouse," etc. both to me and to my saints: and
   like two young roes that are twins, are wrought at one and the same
   time in the soul; bear a very great resemblance to each other in their
   natures, properties, and usefulness, and do inseparably go together;
   for where there is love to God, there will be love to the saints: for
   to say we love God, and do not love our brother, is a manifest
   contradiction, as the apostle John says, 1 John 4:20, "He that loveth
   not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not
   seen?" and these being fed by scripture-precepts and examples, grow and
   increase abundantly, like two young roes which are fat and plump,
   feeding among the lilies: but the other senses of the words
   before-mentioned seem better to agree with them.

Chapter 4 Verse 6

   Until the day break, and the shadows flee away
   I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of
   frankincense.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word [492] think these are the words of the church; who, not
   being able to bear any longer to hear herself so highly commended, as
   in the preceding verses resolves to betake herself to some private
   place, where she might be out of the hearing of such praises and
   commendations: or else, being under great temptations and darkness of
   soul, resolves to go to the mountain of the Lord's house, the church of
   Christ, and there in reading, meditation, prayer, and other exercises,
   wait for his presence, and the manifestations of himself unto her: or
   rather, being in distressed circumstances, she is resolved to go to
   Christ himself, "the rock that is higher than" she; who, for the odor
   of his sacrifice, the fragrancy of his intercession, and sweet-smelling
   garment of his righteousness, may be called "the mountain of myrrh,"
   and "hill of frankincense," as he is "a bundle of myrrh," in chapter
   1:13. But I am rather inclined to think, that they are the words of
   Christ; in which we are told,

   First, The place where he resolves to go to, and abide; "the mountain
   of myrrh, and hill of frankincense;" which I apprehend intend one and
   the same place; though two places in Arabia were so called. [493] The
   allusion may be to mountains and hills, where those odoriferous plants
   grew; such as were in or near Judea: it is said of Pompey the Great,
   that when he passed over Lebanon, after-mentioned, verse 8, he went
   through sweet-smelling groves, and woods of frankincense and balsam;
   [494] and Lebanon is thought by some, [495] to have its name from the
   frankincense that grew upon it; though rather, from the whiteness of
   the snow continually on it; and is, in the Targum of verse 8. called
   "the mountain of snow;" (see Jer. 18:14).

   Secondly, How long he proposes to continue here; "until the day break,
   and the shadows flee away."

   Now by "the mountain of myrrh, and hill of frankincense," most of the
   Jewish writers [496] understand the temple, which was built on mount
   Moriah (2 Chron. 3:1), the place where Abraham offered up his son
   Isaac; in which mountain as the Lord then, so frequently in after-ages,
   especially when the temple was built, appeared unto his people. Now the
   temple may be called "the mountain of myrrh, and hill of frankincense,"
   either in allusion to Moriah, the name of the mountain on which it was
   built; which perhaps might have its name originally from the abundance
   of myrrh which grew upon it; or else, because in it was the holy
   anointing oil, one ingredient in which was "pure myrrh;" and also the
   incense, which was made of "pure frankincense," together with other
   spices; which was likewise put upon their meat-offerings, which were
   there offered up unto the Lord: and this sense of the words is not
   altogether to be despised; for in the temple, the shechinah or divine
   majesty dwelt, until Christ came in the flesh, when the gospel-day
   broke, and the shadows of the ceremonial law vanished, fled and
   disappeared, as has been shewn in chapter 2:17. Though I think rather,
   by "the mountain of myrrh, and hill of frankincense," is intended the
   church of Christ; [497] where he has taken up his residence, and
   resolves to dwell until his second coming; which may be compared to a
   hill or mountain, 1. For their height: hills and mountains are higher
   than any other parts of the earth; and so is the church of Christ than
   the rest of the world: saints are higher in Christ's esteem than all
   the world besides; and are exalted by his grace, and dignified with
   favors by him above all others; and however love and mean they may now
   appear in the eyes of the world, the time is coming when this "mountain
   of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains,
   and shall be exalted above the hills," (Isa. 2:2). 2. For their
   immoveableness: hills and mountains cannot be removed; no more can the
   church or believers in Christ, Psalm 130:1, for "they that trust in the
   Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for
   ever:" they shall never be removed either from Christ's hands or
   Christ's heart; they shall never be removed from a state of
   justification to a state of condemnation; they ate secured by electing
   love, and preserved in Christ Jesus; they are held fast by
   covenant-bands, and are built upon "a sure foundation, upon a rock,"
   against which "the gates of hell can never prevail." 3. For being
   places where trees grow, as oaks, cedars, olives," etc. and famous for
   these were Bashan, Hermon, Lebanon, the mount of olives," etc. in the
   church of Christ are "trees of righteousness," which, being planted by
   Christ's father, flourish like palm-trees, and grow like cedars in
   Lebanon. 4. For being places of pasture for cattle; such were Bashan,
   Carmel, and Gilead: in the church of Christ there is pasture for all
   his sheep; there plenteous provisions of grace are made; "a feast of
   fat things," wine mingled, bread prepared, mad a table sufficiently
   furnished for all Christ's friends and guests, in this his holy
   mountain, the church. 5. In hills and mountains worship used to be
   given, and sacrifices offered up to God, as may be collected from the
   discourse of Christ with the woman of Samaria (John 4:20, 21), as well
   as from other places of scripture: in the church of Christ the worship
   of God is maintained, the word of God is preached, his ordinances are
   administered, and the sacrifices of prayer and praise are offered up to
   him in the name and through the mediation of Christ Jesus. And as it
   may be compared to a mountain and hill, so likewise to "a mountain of
   myrrh, and hill of frankincense," (1.) Because of the fragrancy of
   those graces with which the church is perfumed: hence she is said, in
   chapter 3:6. to be "perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all
   powders of the merchant;" and in this chapter, verse 10. the smell of
   them is said to exceed all spices; and that more especially when they
   are in exercise; so grateful, well-pleasing, and sweet-smelling are
   they then to Christ Jesus. (2.) Because of sacrifices which are of "a
   sweet-smelling savor, that are offered up here, as the sacrifices of
   prayer, which, in Revelation 5:8, are called odors; and are more
   especially so to God the Father, when they are offered up through
   Christ's mediation, being perfumed with his much incense: here are also
   the sacrifices of praise, which are of an exceeding grateful and
   delightful odor to God; for being offered up to him through Christ,
   these spiritual sacrifices become acceptable to him. (3.) Because of
   that pleasure and delight which Christ takes in his people, and that
   sweet communion which they here enjoy with him; so that to them both it
   is "a mountain of myrrh and hill of frankincense;" where the one
   concludes, it is good to be, and the other resolves to stay "till the
   day break," etc. The saints are "the excellent in the earth," with whom
   Christ delights to converse, and to whom his "goodness extends;" he
   says, "the lines are fallen to him in pleasant places, and that he has
   a goodly heritage assigned him by his Father; inasmuch as they are his
   to live and dwell with him for evermore: and to the saints, Christ's
   "tabernacles are amiable" and lovely; they count "a day spent in his
   courts, better than a thousand elsewhere;" because there they see him,
   and have fellowship with him whom their souls love. Now in this
   "mountain of myrrh, and hill of frankincense," Christ, as he delights,
   so he resolves to dwell, "until the day break," etc. Which is,

   1st, Until the day of grace breaks in upon every elect soul, All that
   the Father hath loved with an everlasting love, and hath chosen in
   Christ before the world began, he put into his hands; who, upon the
   reception of them, laid himself under obligation to redeem them by his
   blood, and bring them safe to glory; and as he has already done the
   former, he is now doing the latter, through the ministry of the word;
   and therefore the preaching of the gospel, a standing ministry, and a
   church state, are continued on earth; in which he will stay, until
   every one of those other sheep are called by divine grace, whom he has
   laid himself under obligation to bring in: and now, when grace breaks
   in upon a poor sinner's heart, it is like the break of day unto him;
   light springs into his understanding, which before was darkened; he was
   darkness itself, is now made light in the Lord; and is no more reckoned
   among the children of the night, bat among the children of the day; for
   now the shadows of ignorance and infidelity are fled away; the scales
   of darkness are fallen from his eyes, and in God's light he sees light:
   he now sees his lost and undone state without Christ, the corruption
   and depravity of his nature, and the plague of his own heart; he sees
   the impurity" and imperfection of his own righteousness, and the glory
   and fullness of Christ's; he sees Christ as a proper, suitable, able
   and willing Savior; he sees things he never saw before, and which will
   ever remain invisible to a carnal eye. Now until the day of grace has
   thus broke in upon every elect soul; and the shadows of blindness,
   ignorance, and infidelity, are thus fled and gone; Christ has taken up
   his residence, and will dwell in his church, which, to him, is a
   mountain of myrrh and hill of frankincense. Or else,

   2dly, Until the day of glory breaks; that everlasting day, in which
   there will be no more night; when nil shadows of darkness, infidelity,
   doubts and fears, will flee away; when saints shall be attended no more
   with the long, tedious and dark nights of afflictions and sorrows, and
   shall stand in no need of shadowy ordinances; but shall enjoy Christ,
   the sum and substance of all, and dwell and be delighted with him
   perpetually, upon the everlasting mountains of spices, as has been
   shewn on chapter 2:17.

Chapter 4 Verse 7

   Thou art all fair, my love, there is no spot in thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having mentioned some particular parts of the church,
   wherein she appeared very beautiful; in describing of which his soul
   was so taken with her beauty, that he resolves to dwell with her till
   his second coming; and now, lest it should be thought that there was a
   defect of beauty in the parts not mentioned, he sums up all in this
   general commendation; Thou art all fair, my love, there is no spot in
   thee:" which commendation may regard the church in some particular
   period of time; or, in general, be expressive of the fairness and
   beauty of the church, and every believer in any age of the world. A
   learned Jewish writer [498] would have the words referred to the days
   of Solomon; in which, he affirms, all Israel were righteous: and
   another [499] to the time when Israel received the law from mount
   Sinai; when, it is said, there were none lame, blind, and dumb among
   them: but they much better agree with the primitive and apostolic
   church, that was gathered by the ministry of the apostles after
   Christ's ascension, which is the mind of some Christian expositors;
   [500] and indeed the church then bid as fair for this character, as in
   any" other period of time whatever. Therefore, it may not be amiss if
   we consider how well it agrees with it; which will appear, if we
   observe,

   First, The pure doctrines of grace which were then preached: the
   doctrines of the gospel, by the first ministers thereof, were fully
   preached; they kept back nothing that might be profitable to the
   churches, upon any pretense whatever; they shunned not to declare all
   the counsel of God, whatever was the consequence of it: and this they
   did in all sincerity and godly simplicity; they used no artful methods
   to conceal their principles, but renounced those hidden things of
   dishonesty; they did not handle the word of God deceitfully, but by
   manifestation of the truth, commended themselves to every man's
   conscience; they did not corrupt the word of God [501] and blend it
   with their own inventions, but as of sincerity, but as of God, being
   sent by him, in the sight of God, so spake they in Christ; and were
   always jealous, lest the souls they ministered to should be seduced and
   drawn away, by cunning and artful men, from the simplicity of the
   gospel: they were careful to deliver those doctrines consistently;
   their trumpet did not give an uncertain sound; their word was not yea
   and nay, sometimes one thing, and sometimes another, to the dishonor of
   the gospel, and the confusion of souls, but was all of a piece; they
   preached agreeable to the analogy of faith, and were very solicitous to
   keep to that rule, and not swerve from it: and with a great deal of
   warmth and zeal they adhered to these truths; bravely withstood all
   opposers, feared the faces of none, and studied to please no man; but
   were bold in the name of God to speak the gospel of God, though with
   much contention; and however weak, mean, and contemptible their
   ministry might appear to the world, it was attended with a
   demonstration of the spirit and of power, and was made useful for the
   conversion of thousands of souls; for these truths being received in
   the love thereof, wrought effectually in them that believed; and were
   constantly adhered to and retained by them, mauger all the opposition
   of men and devils.

   Secondly, If we consider the nature of their worship, which was pure
   and spiritual; the ordinances were kept by them, as they were delivered
   to them; were not mixed with human inventions, and, to their eternal
   honor, were constantly attended on by them; they were very frequent and
   fervent in the duties of fasting and prayer, and did nothing of moment
   in the church without them; all the parts of religious worship were
   performed decently and in order by them; in all things they sought the
   glory of God, and the consolation and edification of each other.

   Thirdly, If we take notice of their discipline, which was strict, and
   according to rule: proper officers were chosen by the joint suffrages
   of the church; ministers were by them set apart for the ministry; and
   deacons chose by them to take care of the poor, and serve the tables:
   church censures and excommunications were administered by the whole
   body, and that with a great deal of success; in case of private
   offenses, they gave private admonitions, and for public crimes, rebuked
   before all, that others might fear; those who were erroneous in
   principle, they sharply reproved; and such as were disorderly in
   practice, withdrew from; an heretic, after the first and second
   admonition, they rejected; and such who were the authors of division,
   and causes of contention, they carefully marked, observed and avoided.

   Fourthly, If we take a view of their Christian communion and fellowship
   with each other; they lived in entire unity and harmony with each
   other; they were all of one heart and of one soul; one soul did, as it
   were, dwell in, and actuate all their bodies; they had a great deal of
   sympathy for each other in all distresses, whether inward or outward,
   and freely communicated to each other; they wept with those that wept,
   and rejoiced with those that rejoiced; they kept Christ's new
   commandment, and entirely loved one another; and in so doing, gave an
   evidence of their being the true disciples of Christ; so that the very
   heathens took notice of it, and could say; "See how they love one
   another!" [502] which, though they could not condemn, yet it was not
   very grateful to them.

   Fifthly, Their conversation was as becometh the gospel of Christ Jesus:
   they held the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience; that grace;
   which was revealed unto them, and wrought in them, taught them to deny
   ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and
   godly in this present world; and in so doing, they adorned the gospel,
   honoured their profession, stopped the mouths of gainsayers, and
   recommended religion to others; and thus the primitive church much
   continued for "the first three hundred years after Christ: but we are
   not to imagine, that there were no blemishes and imperfections in her
   during all this time; for there were many, and more especially towards
   the latter end; but, being compared with the state of the church in
   after ages, she might then be said to be all fair, and no spot in her.
   But I rather think the words are not to be limited to the church in any
   one period of time, but are applicable to her and to all believers in
   any age of the world; who are all fair, not upon the foot of their own
   works, as the Targum on the place intimates; for all their
   righteousnesses are as filthy rags, and so are far from making them
   appear fair and beautiful in Christ's sight; but they are so, being
   justified by his righteousness, washed in his blood, and sanctified by
   his Spirit; and so shall be at last presented to him a glorious church,
   not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing," (Eph. 5:27). The title
   and character which Christ here gives to his church, "my love,"! have
   already met with and explained in chapter 1:9. It is here predicated of
   her,

   1st, That she is all fair. She is said to be fair, and is called by
   Christ, his fair one, and the fairest among women, before; but here,
   all fair: To shew, 1. That she was a perfection of beauty, being made
   perfect through that comeliness which Christ put upon her; believers
   are perfectly justified by Christ's righteousness from all sin; stand
   complete in him, and so are esteemed all fair by him: and in respect of
   sanctification, there is a perfection of parts, though not of degrees;
   there is a perfect new creature in all its parts, though it is not as
   yet grown up to be a perfect man in Christ; even as a new born babe,
   which has every part and limb in just proportion, may be said to be
   perfect, though it has not as yet grown up to the stature and bigness
   it will do, if life is continued. 2. That the whole church, and all the
   true members thereof are so; all of the church, every member, every
   individual believer, is fair in Christ's eye; the meanest and weakest
   believer, as well as the greatest and strongest, is made perfectly
   comely with Christ's comeliness, and equally accepted in the beloved.
   3. He says so of the church, to manifest the exceeding greatness of her
   beauty, and how much his heart was taken with it, that he, the king,
   greatly desired it, and delighted to be in her company. 4. To comfort
   her, banish her doubts and fears, and strengthen her faith; who, seeing
   her own vileness and sinfulness, and spots and blemishes, might be
   ready to despond in her mind, and call in question her interest in
   Christ, and his righteousness; therefore he says, "Thou art all fair,
   my love:" I do love thee; thou art exceeding fair and beautiful in my
   eye; all of thee is fair and beautiful; thou art fairer than all
   others, being adorned with my" grace, and clothed with my
   righteousness.

   2dly, He asserts that there was no spot in her; which is not to be
   understood, 1. As if there was no sin in believers; for this is
   contrary to all the experience of God's children, as well as to express
   texts of scripture; the humble confessions and ingenuous
   acknowledgments of saints in all ages, their frequent groans and
   complaints of the weight and burden of it, are plain proofs to the
   contrary; their ardent prayers at the throne of grace, for the
   manifestations of pardoning love, that: God would cleave them from
   secret, and keep them back from presumptuous sins, not only testify
   their commission of sinful actions, but also their sense of indwelling
   corruptions; and their daily slips and falls loudly proclaim the
   depravity of their natures; to imagine that we have no sin in us, is
   but to deceive ourselves, and to give an evidence to others, that the
   truth is not in us: therefore, when Christ says of his church, that
   there is no spot in her, we are not to understand it in this sense.
   Nor, 2. As if the sins of God's people were not sins; for, though they
   are justified by Christ's righteousness from all sin, and have all
   their sins pardoned through Christ's blood: yet their sins do not
   hereby cease to be sins: pardon of sin and justification by Christ's
   righteousness, free souls from an obligation to the punishment due to
   sin, but do not destroy the nature of sin: violations and breaches of
   God's righteous law, made by his own people, are equally esteemed sins
   by him, as those made by others; and though he never will inflict his
   vindictive wrath upon them for their sins; yet he does oftentimes, in a
   fatherly manner, chastise them for them, and brings them under a sense
   and acknowledgment of them before him. But, 3. The church and all
   believers are so in Christ's account; though they have sin in them, and
   have committed sin, and, through infirmity, continue to do so, yet sin
   is not reckoned and imputed to them; for, being clothed with his
   spotless righteousness, he looks upon them as if they had no spot in
   them; and they are so covered with it, that when their sins are sought
   for by divine justice, they shall not be found, nay, God himself,
   having accepted of Christ's righteousness and imputed it to them, sees
   no iniquity in Jacob, nor perverseness in Israel: though all sin is
   seen by him, in articulo providentiae, in the article of providence,
   and nothing escapes his all-seeing eye; yet, in articulo
   justificationis, in the article of justification, he sees no sin in his
   people, so as to reckon it to them, or condemn them for it; for they
   all stand unblameable and unreproveable in his sight; and Christ will
   ere long present them in open view to men and angels, not having spot
   or wrinkle, or any such thing.

Chapter 4 Verse 8

   Come with me from Lebanon, (my spouse) with me from Lebanon:
   look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
   from the lions" dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having, in the verses going before, given a large and full
   commendation of his church's beauty, and having his heart exceedingly
   taken with it, so that he could not bear a distance from her; invites
   her, as his spouse and bride to go along with him, and look off from
   the several places here mentioned. In the words are,

   I.A special title given her, expressive of the nearest relation to him;
   "my spouse."

   II.A kind invitation to go along with him, enforced with the most
   powerful arguments.

   I.A special title is given to her, "my spouse." This is a new one,
   which we never met with before: He had called her his love, his dove,
   and his fair one, but never, till now, his spouse; which is expressive
   of that near relation and strict union that is between Christ and his
   church; which union is represented by several things in scripture, as
   by the union of the head and members, vine and branches; but by none
   more strongly than by the conjugal union of husband and wife, by which
   they become one flesh; which the apostle, Ephesians 5:32, taking notice
   of, applies to Christ and his church: This, says he, "is a great
   mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and his church:" Christ and his
   church being espoused together, become one spirit; hence it is that
   they are called by the same names: Christ is called by the name of
   Israel, which is the church's name, and the church is called by the
   name of Christ; hence all that Christ has is the church's, and all that
   the church has is Christ's; her debts become his, and his grace becomes
   hers; there is a mutual interest of persons and things; and that. which
   crowns all, is, that this union is indissoluble; this band can never be
   broken, nor this marriage-knot be ever untied.

   I shall, now very briefly shew you, 1st, How the church came to be the
   spouse of Christ. 2dly, Why she is first called so here.

   1st, How the church came to be Christ's spouse; a person so much
   beneath him, at such a distance from him, and so unlovely and unlikely
   in herself, it may justly seem strange and be wondered at, "how she
   came to be so nearly related to him. And here now observe, that the
   Lord Jesus Christ from all eternity pitched, his love upon her: that he
   loved her from thence, is manifest from his suretyship-engagements for
   her; he asked her of his Father, who had a right to dispose of her, and
   he gave him his heart's desire, and did not withhold the request of his
   lips from him; which request being made by the Son, and consent given
   by the Father, he then betrothed her to himself for ever, and that in
   righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and. in
   mercies; and resolved to bestow that grace upon her, which should cause
   her to know, own and acknowledge him to be her Lord and husband: but
   notwithstanding this, at present here was an actual consent of her own
   wanting; wherefore he sends his ministering servants in the several
   ages of the world to obtain it: these are sent to display his
   greatness, discover the richness of his grace, and speak of all his
   glories; which, being impressed upon souls by the mighty power of his
   spirit and graces they are willing to give up themselves to him to be
   his for ever, to love, own, and acknowledge him as their Lord and
   husband; which may be called "the day of their espousals" to him: but
   all this will more visibly and gloriously appear, when all the elect
   are gathered in, and every soul of them made willing to be a holy
   spouse unto him; then shall the nuptials be solemnized, and that voice
   shall be heard in heaven, "the marriage of the Lamb is come;" whose
   wife, being "as a bride adorned for her husband," shall be received by
   him, and enter with him into the marriage-chamber, where they shall
   spend an endless eternity in the enjoyment of each other.

   2dly, Why she is first called so here; she is in the following verses,
   and in other parts of this song, frequently called so, but never before
   this time. 1. Being all fair, without any spot or blemish, being
   prepared by his grace for himself, and having a grant from him to be
   "arrayed in fine linen, clean and white," he calls her his spouse; for
   now she looked something like one, having on the wedding garment,
   Christ's spotless righteousness. 2. The marriage was now consummated,
   "the day of his espousals" was over, which is mentioned in chapter
   3:11. for all that comes between that and these words, is a
   commendation of his church's beauty, which his heart was wonderfully
   taken with on his marriage-day; and when he had finished the
   commendation, salutes her with this title, my spouse. 3. The mentioning
   of it here, may be also to prevail with her to go along with him: Where
   should a wife be? or with whom should she be, but with her husband? I
   am thy husband, and thou art my spouse and bride; and therefore both
   duty and affection to me should oblige thee to go along with me: so
   that the import of the words is much the same with those; "forget thine
   own people, and thy father's house, so shall the king greatly desire
   thy beauty; for he is thy Lord, and worship thou him," (Ps. 45:10, 11).
   Which leads me to consider,

   II.The invitation he gives her to go along with him,, Come with me, my
   spouse," etc. or, as the words may be read, "Thou shalt come with me
   [503] etc." for whatever Christ invites and exhorts us to, he must give
   us grace and strength to perform, and, blessed be his name, he does.
   Lebanon, from whence she is exhorted and invited to remove, was a
   goodly mountain, on the borders of the land of Canaan, northward; it
   was famous for odoriferous trees, and especially for cedars, wherefore
   frequent mention is made of it in this song; this was that "goodly
   mountain and Lebanon; which Moses had such a desire to see before his
   death (Deut. 3:25). the allusion may be to the bringing of Pharaoh's
   daughter, whom Solomon married, from the house of the forest of
   Lebanon, where she might be first placed, to the house he built for
   her, when it was prepared to receive her [504] (1 Kings 9:24). Some of
   the Jewish writers [505] think, that a mighty conflux of people to the
   temple, from all parts of Judea, and even from among the uncircumcised,
   who are compared to lions and leopards, is here intended: but rather,
   we are to understand the words as an exhortation, to remove from the
   temple and from Jerusalem; for perhaps by Lebanon here, may be meant
   the temple, as in Zechariah 11:1. "Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the
   fire may devour thy cedars;" which, by some Jewish writers, [506] is
   expounded of the temple, and the destruction of it: for they tell us,
   [507] that forty years before the destruction of it, the gates of the
   temple opened of themselves; at which R. Jochanan Ben Zaccai, as if
   affrighted, rebuked them, and said, "Now know I that thy destruction is
   at hand, according to the prophecy of Zechariah, the son of Iddo, Open
   thy gates, O Lebanon, etc." The temple might be called so, because it
   was made of the wood of Lebanon, of cedars which were brought from
   thence, and because the frankincense which grew there, was daily burnt
   in it, and the glory of it was brought into it. Now in Christ's time
   the temple was become a den of thieves, as he calls it, in Matthew
   21:13, and in the apostles time was a den of lions, and a mountain of
   leopards; was full of painted and spotted hypocrites, and cruel
   persecutors; wolves in sheeps clothing, who made havock of the church,
   and persecuted the saints from place to place: wherefore Christ removed
   from them, broke up housekeeping with them, and left their house
   desolate unto them; he took his gospel from them, ordered his ministers
   to depart far hence to the Gentiles, and calls forth his people from
   among them, to go along with him thither, "Come with me from Lebanon,
   my spouse, etc." Also he bids her look from the top of Amana, from the
   top of Shenir and Hermon: Amana [508] was a mountain, which divided
   Cilicia from Syria; from whence perhaps the river at the foot of it
   took its name, which in 2 Kings 5:12 is called Abana, but in the keri
   or margin it is read Amana: and so the Targum here expounds it of the
   people which dwelt by the river Amana: R. Solomon Jarchi would have it
   to be a mountain in the northern border of Israel, and that it is the
   same with mount Hor; [509] and indeed, in every place where mention is
   made of mount Hor, the Targum of Jonathan [510] always renders it,
   Taurus Umanus; for Amanus, according to Ptolemy, was a part of mount
   Taurus; it is joined with Libanu by Josephus, [511] and was a part of
   it, where the snow lay all the summer; as it is both with that and
   Carmel by AElianus. [512] Shenir and Hermon were one and the same
   mountain, called by different names: Hermon perhaps was the common name
   to the whole mountain; and that part of it which belonged to the
   Sidonians, they called Sirion; and the other part which belonged to the
   Amorites, they called Shenir, Deuteronomy 3:9. Now all these mountains
   may be called dens of lions, and mountains of leopards, not only
   because they were inhabited by those wild beasts, [513] but because
   they were inhabited by cruel, savage and tyrannical persons, and by
   thieves and robbers, and such like persons, and especially Amana, as
   Strabo [514] Cicero [515] and Plutarch [516] relate; and which appears
   also from what Lucan says, in his Pharsalia, lib. 3. verse 244.

   -- Venere feroces,

   Cappadoces duri populus nunc cultor Amani.

   Shenir and Hermon were formerly, as Jarchi observes, the dens of those
   lions, Sihon and Og, kings of Bashan and of the Amorites; unless they
   should rather be thought to be the proper names of some places about
   Lebanon, for Adrichomius [517] says, "The mountain of the leopards,
   which was round and high, was two miles distant northwards from
   Tripolis, three from the city Areas southward, and one from mount
   Lebanon." Now from the tops of these mountains, Christ would have his
   church look, and take a prospect how the gospel was received, what
   numbers of souls were converted, and how churches were planted in
   Phoenicia, Cyprus, Cyrenia, Antioch, etc. though it was contemned,
   rejected, and persecuted by the Jewish nation; so that the words may be
   understood of Christ's carrying his gospel into the Gentile world, and
   succeeding in it, and calling his people to take notice of it. Or else,

   This may intend in general Christ's call to his church and people, to
   leave the society of, and come out from among the wicked men of the
   world, comparable to lions and leopards, and to go along with him, as
   in 2 Corinthians 6:17 and Revelation 18:4. And here are two sorts of
   arguments, which he makes use of to enforce this upon them.

   First, That the persons from whom he exhorts them to remove, were no
   better than lions and leopards; and to converse with them, was no
   better than to dwell in the dens and mountains of such. 1. Wicked and
   ungodly persons may be compared to lions, especially those who are of a
   cruel and persecuting nature: hence David, being among such, says, "my
   soul is among lions;" he frequently represents the wicked as such, and
   desires deliverance from them: likewise the apostle Paul calls a
   persecuting Nero, "the lion," out of whose mouth it pleased the Lord to
   deliver him. 2. They may be compared to leopards, (1.) For their being
   full of spots; the leopard is not fuller of spots, than the sinner is
   of sin; as the one is natural, so is the other; and as the leopard
   cannot change one spot, nor make any alteration in his nature; no more
   can the sinner change his own heart, nor by any power of his own remove
   the spots and stains of sin; as Jeremy says, Jeremiah 13:23: "Can the
   Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also
   do good, that are accustomed to do evil." (2.) For their craftiness and
   cruelty, as is manifest from Jeremiah 5:6; Hosea 13:7. AElianus reports
   [518] that when the leopard is in want of food, it hides itself among
   the thickets, so as it cannot be seen; and, by the sweetness of its
   odor, draws the fawns, does, wild goats, and such like animals to it;
   and when they are near, breaks out of its lurking-place, and makes them
   its prey "other artful methods it makes use of for the same purpose, as
   is recorded by others; [519] which is a just emblem of the craftiness
   and cruelty of wicked and ungodly men, who use all the stratagems to
   ensnare, and exercise all the crusty they can devise upon those who are
   "quiet in the land." (3.) For their swiftness; so in Habakkuk 2:8, the
   horses of the Chaldeans are said to be swifter than leopards: wicked
   men, though slow and backward to that which is good, yet are swift to
   do mischief; no sooner do their hearts devise wickedness, but their
   feet run to accomplish it.

   Secondly, The second argument he uses with her to quit the society of
   wicked men, is, the enjoyment of his own company, which is far
   preferable to theirs; "Come with me, my spouse." 1. Christ's company is
   much more pleasant than theirs; though the ways of sin may seem
   pleasant for a while, yet at length they will appear no other than the
   haunts of lions and leopards; though the company of sinners may seem
   now sweet and delightful, they will be found at last to be more bitter
   than death; but Christ's ways are always "ways of pleasantness:" it is
   good for the believer to be always in his company, where he finds solid
   pleasure, and inexpressible delight; more than ever he did in the tents
   of wickedness. 2. It is more profitable: the company and conversation
   of wicked men is hurtful and pernicious; "evil communications corrupt
   good manners;" but the company of Christ is always profitable: a
   believer always gets something by it; it has a mighty influence upon
   the inward frame of his soul, and upon iris outward walk in the world;
   it makes him both comfortable in himself, and useful to others; so that
   he sustains no loss, but undoubtedly is a gainer, who parts with the
   company of the men of the world for Christ's. 3. Christ's company is
   much more safe than theirs: the company of wicked men is always
   dangerous; there is danger, not only of being infected with their sins,
   but also of partaking of their plagues; it tends to ruin here, and
   leads to everlasting destruction; but the believer is always safe in
   Christ's company, in what place or condition soever he be; though he
   walks through the waters of affliction, and fire of tribulation, nay,
   though through the valley of the shadow of death; yet he is always
   safe, being guided by his counsel, supported by his hand, and comforted
   by his presence.

   Now Christ in all this discovers a great deal of care over, and
   affection to his church and people. One would think she cannot
   withstand a request, delivered in such an affectionate manner, where
   her own comfort, profit, and safety, are so much concerned: Who would
   dwell in lions" dens, and in the mountains of the leopards, when they
   might have such agreeable and delightful company as Christ's is? which
   is to be valued and preferred before this world, and all the things of
   it; though God's own children are too apt to he taken with them; and
   therefore have need, as here, to be called to look off from them to
   things that are spiritual and heavenly; and not take up their rest and
   satisfaction in those things and places, where lions dwell and leopards
   walk.

Chapter 4 Verse 9

   Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister; my spouse: thou hast
   ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy
   neck.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having invited his church to go along with him, here
   discovers the reason of it, because his heart was ravished with her; he
   had such an affection for her, that he could not bear to be at a
   distance from her. In these words, consider,

   I.The titles given to her; "my sister, my spouse."

   II.What he declares to her; "thou hast ravished my heart;" which
   expression is doubled.

   III.What it was his heart was so taken with, which had such a mighty
   influence upon him; "with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy
   neck."

   I.I shall consider the titles he gives unto her, and they are two, "my
   sister, my spouse;" one of which, namely, "my spouse," has been
   explained in the former verse, and is here repeated to shew his
   affection to her, how much he delighted, in her under this character;
   as also, to assure her of the truth of it, as well as to manifest his
   satisfaction in this relation, and that he was not ashamed to own and
   acknowledge her as such: the other title, "my sister," we have not met
   with before. Now Christ may call the church his sister, 1. More
   amatorio, it being a love-strain; [520] and this being a love-song,
   where Christ and his church are expressing their love to each other;
   such a title as this cannot be looked upon as an improper one: it being
   an endearing expression, used by husbands to their wives; as by Raguel
   to Edna, Tobit 7:18, and by Tobias to Sara, chapter 8:4. 2. More
   Hebraeorum: it being usual with the Jews to call those of their own
   kindred and country, brethren and sisters; and with none but such were
   they allowed to marry; and perhaps to this the apostle has a respect (1
   Cor. 9:5), "Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife?" etc.
   agreeable to this, Christ calls his church, his sister, whom he had
   espoused to himself. 3. He may call her so on account of his
   incarnation; he assuming the same nature, and partaking of the same
   flesh and blood the children did; and so being of one and the same mass
   and lump with them, is not ashamed to call them brethren; which, it may
   be, is intended in that wish of the church's, chapter 8:1. "O that thou
   wert as my brother!" etc. that is, O that thou wert incarnate! that we
   were of the same flesh and blood, and thereby thou appear to be my
   brother, and I thy sister. 4. On the account of her adoption: God has,
   by his sovereign, free, and distinguishing grace, adopted all his elect
   into his family, and has in his covenant of grace declared himself to
   be their Father, and them to be his sons and daughters; and now, being
   the sons and daughters of the same Father as Christ as the Son of, they
   become his brethren and sisters, which he acknowledges (John 20:17). 5.
   Being born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
   the will of man, but of God, they bear this character; and are so in
   Christ's esteem, according to what he says (Matthew 12:50), "Whosoever
   shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my
   brother, and sister, and mother:" Christ bears all relations to his
   people, and is willing to own them in all relations to him. 6. Perhaps
   the church is here first called Christ's sister; because Christ having
   called his people out of Judea's land, and gathered a church among the
   Gentiles, that little sister spoken of in chapter 8:8, it might hereby
   appear that he had a real affection for her, that she was valued by
   him, and nearly related to him.

   II.What he declares unto her, is, that she had "ravished his heart." It
   is but one word in the Hebrew text, and is used is this form and sense
   no where else, but twice in this verse; for Christ's love being so
   unspeakable and inexpressible, he coins, as one, [521] well observes,
   new words to discover it by; it is variously rendered, and perhaps by
   laying the several versions together, it will appear more fully what is
   intended by it. 1. The words may be rendered, "thou hast heartened me,
   or put heart into me," and caused me to be of good cheat; so Cocceius
   and Schmidt: the word is used in this sense, in the Syriac Testament,
   in Matthew 9:2, and 1 Thessalonians 5:14 and then the sense may be
   this; the love which I bear unto thee, the charming ideas of thee,
   which I always carry in my mind, and the "joy which was set before me,"
   of having thy company and presence for ever in glory; have made my
   heavy sufferings easy, animated me as man and mediator, and cheerfully
   carried me through them all for thy sake, Hebrews 12:2. 2. Others read
   them, "thou hast unhearted me;" thou hast taken away my heart, and
   stolen it from me, so that I have no heart left in me, so the
   Septuagint; which reading, R. Aben Ezra confirms. Sometimes fear throws
   persons into such a condition, that they are as if they had no heart,
   spirit, life, or soul in them; as the Canaanities in Judges 5:1
   sometimes wonder and surprise; thus the queen of Sheba, when she had
   seen Solomon's wisdom and glory, it is said, "there was no more spirit
   in her:" and sometimes love has such an influence on the heart, and so
   it had here on Christ; it was so powerful, that it had taken away his
   heart; "thou hast ravished my heart," that is, thou hast taken it away
   from me, as it were, by force and violence, that it is no longer mine,
   but thine; thou art master over it, and hast the command of it [522]
   having claimed it to thyself as thine own. 3. It is rendered by others,
   "thou hast drawn my heart unto thee," so R. Solomon Jarchi; or,
   "brought me near," or "caused me to draw nigh": [523] that our hearts
   should be drawn to Christ, by views of his loveliness, and discoveries
   of his love to us, is no wonder; but that Christ's heart should be
   drawn to us, in whom were neither love nor loveliness, is surprising;
   which shews the exceeding greatness, freeness, and richness of Christ's
   love. 4. It may be read, "thou hast coupled my heart with thine;" and
   in this sense the Talmudists use the word: [524] Christ's heart and a
   believer's are so knit, joined and coupled together, that they are but
   one heart, one soul, and one spirit; "he that is joined to the Lord is
   one spirit;" all the powers of hell and earth, united together, are not
   able to disjoin and separate, either a believer's heart from Christ, or
   Christ's heart from a believer. 5. The Targum paraphrases it thus, "thy
   love is fixed upon the table of my heart;" it is wrote there in legible
   characters, which can never be erased: the church is not only engraven
   on the palms of Christ's hands, but also upon the table of his heart;
   and so the church has what she wished for, chapter 8:6. "Set me as a
   seal upon thine heart:" Christ's love to the church is so riveted and
   fixed in his heart, that there is no removing it; "Who shall separate
   us from the love of Christ?" 6. It is translated by others, "thou hast
   wounded my heart," so the Vulgate Latin; which reading is not to be
   despised; R. David Kimchi [525] owns it: Christ's heart was wounded
   with one of love's darts [526] with an arrow shot from one of the
   church's eyes; which is expressive of the force and power of love, with
   what vehemence it dwelt in, and what influence it had upon the heart of
   Christ.

   Now this expression is repeated, to shew the vehemency and
   passionateness of his love, and the exceeding greatness of it; as also
   to assure her of the reality of it, that he was hearty end sincere in
   it; and did not say this by way of compliment to her, as lovers too
   often do; nor was it a word which wan rashly spoken by him, or that
   dropped from him at unawares; but as it proceeded from his heart, so it
   was spoken by him in a deliberate manner; therefore he repeats it, not
   to correct, but to confirm it.

   Hence we may conclude what interest a believer has in Christ's heart.
   What may he not expect? what can he want? what need he fear, that has
   so great a share in Christ's heart and what reason has he to give
   Christ his heart, who has so much of Christ's?

   III.I shall now take notice of the things with which Christ's heart was
   ravished. 1. "With one of the church's eyes:" the eye is an attractive
   of love; [527] and therefore it is said in Proverbs 6:25. "Neither let
   her take thee with her eye-lids." By the eye, with which Christ was so
   taken, may be meant, the eye of faith; by which a soul looks on him,
   and loves him; beholds his fullness, and wishes for an interest in him;
   and looks to him, and expects from him alone life and salvation: He
   says, it was with one of her eyes; which shews that a believer has more
   eyes than one; and therefore we read of "the eyes of their
   understanding," Ephesians 1:18, but it was with this eye of faith, by
   which she looked to him, and believed on him, that his heart was so
   ravished; and that but with one look from it, or glance of it, as both
   Junius and Ainsworth read it; nay, though but a very glimmering one;
   for faith, even in its lowest degree, is exceeding precious to Christ
   Jesus; which shews how easily and quickly a conquest is gained over
   Christ's heart by faith; his heart must needs be full of love to
   believers, since it is ravished and overcome even with a single
   glimmering look from faith's eye; and if so, how" much will his heart
   be ravished, when we shall see him "face to face, just as he is;" take
   a full view of him, look at him, and feed our eyes for ever upon the
   unutterable glories of his person! 2. "With one chain of her neck:" the
   neck is a beautiful part of the body, and being agreeably adorned, is
   exceeding enamoring: the Vulgate Latin version is, "with one lock of
   hair of thy neck." so Aquila; which hung down in it, and looked very
   beautiful, and with which lovers are sometimes taken. [528] By the
   neck, we may also understand faith, as we have observed on verse 4. it
   being neither unusual nor improper to represent one and the same thing
   under different metaphors: and by the chain, may be meant the graces of
   the Spirit, which, being linked and chained, do inseparably go
   together; and being put about this neck of faith, makes it look very
   beautiful: every grace is as a golden link or precious pearl in
   Christ's esteem; who having, beautified his people with them, takes the
   utmost delight in viewing them; and whilst he is observing how
   beautifully they are adorned therewith, his heart is ravished with
   them.

Chapter 4 Verse 10

   How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy
   love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having declared in the preceding verse, how much his heart
   was delighted in, and ravished with the faith of his church; now
   proceeds to shew how well pleased he was with her love, and other
   graces of the Spirit, in these words; where.

   I.The excellency of her love is set forth.

   II.The sweet smell of her ointments is commended.

   I.He gives some excellent characters of her love to him. Christ is the
   object of a believer's love; and he is well pleased with that love
   which they shew to him: the nature of this love, its spring and
   actings, have been shewn already, on chapter 1:3, where it has been
   observed, that it is superlative and universal; a believer loves Christ
   above all, and all of Christ; it is, or at least ought to be, constant
   and ardent, and is always hearty and unfeigned; it springs and arises
   from views of Christ's loveliness, and sights of his suitableness and
   fullness, from a sense of his love, and a discovery of union and
   relation to him; and is heightened and increased by enjoying communion
   and fellowship with them; it manifests itself by a regard to his
   commands and ordinances, his truths, his people and his presence, and
   by parting with, and bearing all for him, as has there been more
   largely shewn, Now of such a love as this, he says, 1. That it is fair;
   "How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse!" the titles and characters
   he gives her, have been already explained; it was proper to repeat them
   here, that whilst he was commending her love, he might shew his own;
   and assure her of the relation she stood in to him, and that he "had an
   undoubted right to the affections of her heart: he here says, that her
   love to him was fair, that is, lovely, delightful, grateful, and
   acceptable; and it appears to be exceeding well-pleasing to him; for
   those persons, he declares, are the objects of his love, to whom he
   manifests himself in a way of special grace and favor; he overrules all
   things here for their good; he gives them more grace, has prepared
   glory for them, and will preserve them safe unto it: not that their
   love is the meritorious and procuring cause of all this, nor the
   condition of their enjoying it; for his love to them has resolved all
   these thing? for them beforehand, and is the cause of theirs; but when
   it is wrought in their souls, and discovers itself to him, he is
   pleased to shew by those instances of his grace, how fair and lovely it
   is in his sight. 2. He says, that it is "better than wine:" he here
   asserts the same of her love, which she had of his, in chapter 1:2.
   Christ and the church, in this Song, do frequently gather up each
   others words, striving, as it were, to outdo each other in their
   expressions of love; but Christ will in no wise come behind, and be
   outdone by his church and people; though it may well be wondered at,
   that Christ should have the same to say of our love, as we have of his;
   yet so it is: he here declares, it is "better than wine," that is, more
   grateful and pleasant, more refreshing and reviving; "wine makes glad
   the heart of man," Psalm 104:15. but it cannot cheer, and make glad the
   heart of man, more than a sinner's love does the heart of Christ: wine
   was used in feasts, and counted a principal part thereof; therefore the
   "house of feasting", was called the "house of drinking," that is, wine,
   Ecclesiastes 7:2. the feast which the rich Pharisee made for Christ,
   was not, as one [529] well observes, thought so much of by him, nor
   half so entertaining to him, as the love which the poor woman shewed
   him: wine was used in the legal sacrifices; but the wine of legal
   sacrifices, or any external performance, is not so valued by Christ as
   a sinner's love is; and indeed no duties or performances whatever are
   acceptable to him, unless love be the inward principle from whence they
   flow, and by Which they are acted. 3. He sets off the greatness and
   excellency of it, by using a word of the plural number; "How fair are
   thy loves [530] how much better are thy loves," etc. which may be
   expressive of the several actings of it towards him, for it discovers
   itself various ways; and also of the several fruits which accompany or
   spring from it; all which serve for the greater commendation of it. 4.
   The manner of the expressions, which is by way of interrogation and
   admiration; "How fair! etc. how much better!" etc. as if it could not
   be well expressed, how fair and lovely it was; which is an evidence of
   the valuableness of it, or at least an indication how much Christ
   esteemed it; Christ's love has its heights and depths, and lengths, and
   breadths; and to hear souls speak after such a manner, concerning that,
   need not to be wondered at; but to hear Christ express himself after
   this manner, concerning ours, is strange and surprising.

   II.Her ointments are next commended, and the smell of them: in chapter
   1:3 we read of Christ's ointments, here of the church's; in both places
   one and the same thing is intended, namely, the graces of the Spirit;
   why these are called ointments, have been there shewn. These ointments,
   or graces of the Spirit, are first Christ's and then the church's: the
   head is first anointed with them, and then the members; he without
   measure, but they in measure; which being poured forth upon them, and
   they anointed with them, the smell of them is exceeding grateful to
   him: the smell of these ointments intends the actings and exercises of
   grace upon him; which are very delightful to him, and preferred by him
   to all spices, even to all that were used in the holy anointing oil,
   Exodus 30:23, 24, that was not so valuable as this "anointing which
   teacheth all things;" nor the smell of that so much esteemed by Christ,
   as this is.

Chapter 4 Verse 11

   Thy lips, O my spouse! drop as the honey-comb: honey and milk
   are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell
   of Lebanon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having declared, in the two former verses, how much his
   heart was taken with the faith and love of his church, and delighted
   with the smell of her ointments, here, with pleasure, takes notice of
   her mellifluous language, and sweet-smelling dress. Two things are here
   commended in her;

   I.The sweetness of her speech.

   II.The smell of her garments.

   I.The sweetness of her speech: Christ's heart was not only ravished
   with her sparkling eye and dazzling chain, but also with her charming
   lips and graceful language; "Thy lips, O my spouse! drop as the
   honey-comb," etc. her lips dropped things for matter like the
   honey-comb; and these things in such a manner as the honey-comb does:
   so the speech of persons, flowing from the mouth and tongue, is said to
   be sweeter than the honey-comb; [531] and lovers are said to be sweeter
   to one another than the sweet honey. [532]

   First, Things for matter like the honey-comb; "Pleasant words," says
   Solomon, Proverbs 18:24, "are as an honey-comb, sweet to the soul, and
   health to the bones." Such pleasant words, which are as the honey-comb,
   drop from the church's, and from every believer's lips, 1. In prayer;
   so the Targum expounds these words of the priest's lips, dropping as
   the honey-comb, when they prayed in the holy court. The believer
   oftentimes drops things in prayer; which, as they are profitable to
   himself and others, for the effectual, fervent, ejnergoumh&gt;nh, the
   inwrought "prayer of a righteous man availeth much," James 5:16, so
   they are sweet, pleasant, delightful and acceptable to Christ: "the
   prayer of the upright is his delight;" the prayers of the meanest
   believer are as delightful music in his ears, as sweet-smelling odors
   in his nostrils, and like the honey or honey-comb to his taste. 2. In
   praises: Christ has done great things for his church and people in the
   redemption and salvation of them; and therefore praise becomes them; it
   is their duty: and as this work is oftentimes pleasant to their own
   souls; so in discharging it, they often drop things in the praise of
   Christ's person and grace, which are exceeding grateful and
   well-pleasing to him. 3. In confessing Christ's name, and owning his
   truths before men: this is a work exceeding necessary, and a duty
   highly incumbent on God's children; at every opportunity, and whenever
   they are called to it, they ought to do it; and as the omission of it
   is much resented by Christ, so the performance of it will be graciously
   rewarded, as appears from Matthew 10:32; thus Paul, both at Jerusalem
   and at Rome, and many other martyrs and confessors, have, in the behalf
   of Christ and his gospel, dropped words like the honey-comb. 4. In the
   ministry of the word: the church's lips are the ministers of the
   gospel, so Theodoret; whose business is to deliver, not so much "the
   senses of the law," which is Jarchi's note on the words, as the
   doctrines of the gospel; these lips drop "the wholesome words of our
   Lord Jesus Christ;" and not words which eat like a canker, but words,
   which, like the honey-comb, are "health to the bones." 5. In common
   conversation: the lips of the saints do frequently therein drop words
   pleasant and delightful; which tend to the edification of those with
   whom they converse, and "minister grace to the hearers;" and so are
   like the honey-comb, both pleasant and profitable.

   Secondly, Her lips dropped these things in such a manner as the
   honey-comb does; 1. Freely, and without pressing or squeezing: a soul
   that has received the "grace of God in truth, cannot but speak of the
   things which he has heard and seen; being full of matter, his belly is
   as wine which hath no vent, and is ready to burst, like new bottles;"
   therefore he must speak, that he "may be refreshed;" there needs no
   other constraint to be laid on him, than what he feels in his own
   breast. 2. Gradually: the honey-comb does not pour out. all at once,
   but by degrees; a man of grace, like the virtuous woman in Proverbs
   31:26 opens his mouth with wisdom, and not like the fool who pours out
   his foolishness, and utters all his mind at once; but delivers his
   words with moderation and discretion, and observes proper seasons and
   opportunities to speak his mind: now a word fitly, prudently, and
   seasonably spoken, is like apples of gold in pictures of silver;" for
   as we are to walk, so we are to "talk in wisdom," both to those "that
   are without," and to those that are within. 3. Constantly: the
   honey-comb, though it drops gradually, yet it keeps constantly
   dropping; so a believer's speech should "be always with grace;" he
   should be always praying or praising, or dropping something which may
   tend to the magnifying of God's grace, and the good and edification of
   souls.

   These words in general shew the choiceness of a believer's discourse;
   that it is not any thing that is the subject of it; no common and
   ordinary things which he is speaking of, but what are choice and
   excellent; as the honey which drops from the honey-comb is esteemed the
   best, being what we call life-honey; as also, how much Christ's heart
   was taken with it, and his affections drawn by it; it had a mighty
   influence upon him, and strongly engaged his heart towards her; see
   Proverbs 5:3. Now the reason why her lips dropped after this manner,
   was, because "honey and milk were under her tongue;" and. therefore
   they could not well drop otherwise. The ancients had a sort of food of
   this mixture, called by the Greeks meligala [533] and sometimes
   candylos [534] which was the same composition: according to Galen [535]
   it was not safe to take milk, particularly goats milk, without honey;
   Jove is said [536] to be nursed with such a mixture: and this being
   very grateful to the taste, the speech of the church for pleasantness
   is compared to it: so Pindar [537] compares his hymn or ode to honey
   mixed with milk, as being sweet and grateful; and in Plautus [538] it
   is said, "Your words are honey and milk:" and it may be farther
   observed, that such a mixture of milk and honey, with poppies in it,
   was given to the new-married bride, when brought home to her husband;
   [539] which was now the case of the church. By "milk and honey," may be
   intended the aboundings and overflowings of grace in a believer's
   heart, which thereby is made like Canaan's land, "flowing with milk and
   honey;" now out of the abundance of this grace, received into the
   heart, the mouth speaks: or else, by them may.369 be meant the
   doctrines of the gospel; which may very well be compared thereunto,
   words sweeter than honey and milk. [540]

   1st, To honey, 1. The gospel is gathered out of the choice flowers of
   the scriptures: the ministers of it, "who labor in the word and
   doctrine," are the bees, who come laden with the honey of the gospel,
   into the hive of the church, by which souls are delighted and
   refreshed. 2. It is like to honey for its sweetness: thus David could
   say, Psalm 119:103. by experience, "How sweet are thy words unto my
   taste! Yea sweeter than honey to my mouth:" a gracious soul, who feeds
   on the gospel, and tastes the sweetness of it, finds it, as Ezekiel did
   his roll, "like honey for sweetness" in his mouth; and so it is always
   thus grateful to a spiritual man, who has a proper gust and relish of
   it. 3. Like honey, it is of a nourishing nature: honey was not only the
   food of babes, but of grown persons, as appears from Isaiah 7:15, 22,
   the gospel has in it food both for "children and for strong man and
   that which is exceeding nourishing to both. 4. Like the honey which
   Jonathan eat of, it enlightens the eyes: when the Spirit of God
   introduces it into a sinner's heart, it gives light there, as the
   psalmist says, Psalm 119:130." The entrance of thy words giveth light;"
   it gives light into a man's self, into his lost and miserable state by
   nature; it gives light into the impurity of his heart, and the
   imperfection of his obedience; it gives light into the person, grace
   and righteousness of Christ; and is an instrument, in the Spirit's
   hands, "to guide his feet in the way of peace." 5. It is like the honey
   the Israelites sucked out of the rock in the wilderness: the rock is
   Christ, from whence the honey of the gospel flows; he is the author,
   and he is the subject of it. Or, 6. It is like the honey Samson found
   in the carcass of the lion: Christ is the "lion of the tribe of Judah;
   in whose slain body and precious blood, the honey of gospel-grace is to
   be found by poor sinners, who feed upon it.

   2dly, As the gospel may be compared to honey, so likewise to milk; it
   is called the "sincere milk of the word;" which is not mixed and
   blended with human doctrines, but is free from such adulterations; and
   so is exceeding profitable, and no ways hurtful to the souls of men. 1.
   it may be compared to milk, because it is easy of digestion, and
   therefore proper food for new-born babes: hence the apostle fed the
   Corinthians with the milk of the word, and not with the strong meat
   thereof; because they were not as yet able to bear it, could not digest
   it; but the plainer and more easy truths of the gospel are like milk,
   easy of digestion to souls that are horn again; though even these to a
   natural man are hard sayings, which he cannot bear. 2. Like milk, it is
   very nourishing; Christ's new-born babes grow hereby, being "nourished
   up in the words of faith, and of good doctrine. 3. Milk is of a cooling
   nature, and useful in abating the violence of inflammations; [541] so
   the gospel, being applied by the Spirit to a poor sinner, who has been
   under a work of the law, represses the violence of those inflammations
   raised in his conscience, by a fiery law's working wrath there; which
   is wonderfully allayed by the milk of the gospel, and the application
   of the exceeding great and precious promises of it, which lead the soul
   to the person, blood and righteousness of Jesus Christ. 4. Milk is
   esteemed useful to persons in consumptions, and therefore a milky diet
   is usually recommended to them; sin is a wasting and consuming
   distemper, which is only cured by bringing the milk of the gospel;
   which, when powerfully applied by the Spirit of God, is "the savor of
   life unto life;" and will not only recover a person that is far gone,
   and in the most declining condition, but also restore him from death
   itself.

   Now when these are said to be under her tongue, it intends either, (1.)
   That they were in her heart; so Psalm 66:17: "he was exalted with my
   tongue," or he was exalted under my tongue, that is, in my heart; it
   was in my heart to exalt him, I purposed and designed it: so here,
   "honey and milk are under thy tongue," that is, they are in thy heart;
   it is one thing to have a notion of the gospel in our heads, and
   another thing to have it in our hearts by a comfortable experience.
   (2.) It supposes that she tasted the sweetness of those truths; she
   rolled them as a sweet morsel under her tongue, as Job 20:12, resolving
   to have all the pleasure and satisfaction which might arise from
   thence. (3.) That these were the constant subject of her meditation,
   Psalm 10:7, having tasted a sweetness in them, which drew her
   affections to them, her thoughts were always employed about them. (4.)
   That she was always ready to speak of them at suitable times, and on
   proper occasions, having them under her tongue. (5.) This shews the
   difference there is between a carnal, Christless sinner, and a true
   believer; the one has "the poison of asps under his lips," Romans 3:13,
   and the other "honey and milk under his tongue;" the speech of the one
   is poisonous and infectious, and the language of the other sweet and
   edifying; so that as by their words they shall be justified, by their
   words also they may be known; their speech bewrays them, and declares
   to what company they belong.

   II.The second thing commended in her, is the smell of her garments; the
   ancients used to scent their garments; Calypso gave to Ulysses
   sweet-smelling garments; [542] "and the smell of thy garments is like
   the smell of Lebanon:" in Lebanon grew many odoriferous trees, which
   did emit a fragrant smell to passers by, hence called "sweet-smelling
   Lebanon;" [543] so the graces of God's people are said to smell as
   Lebanon, Hosea 14:6. By her garments here, may be meant, 1. The
   "garments of salvation, and the robe of Christ's righteousness:
   Christ's garments are said to "smell of myrrh, aloes and cassia; now
   these very garments are put upon the believer, so that it is no wonder
   his garments smell like Lebanon; in these believers appear before God,
   as Jacob did before his father, in the garments of his elder brother
   Esau, and are in his nostrils a sweet-smelling savor; for the smell of
   their raiment to him is like "the smell of a field which the Lord hath
   blessed;" he is exceeding well pleased with it, and with them in it;
   Christ smells a sweet odor, even in those garments which he himself has
   wrought out, and clothed his people with. Or else, 2. By them we may
   understand the outward conversation garments of, the saints; which are
   wholesome and savory, and not like the conversation of the wicked,
   filthy, of an ill smell, nauseous and infectious: when works go along
   with words, and practice with profession; when with lips dropping like
   the honey-comb, the sweet-smelling garment of a gospel conversation is
   joined, how does it adorn a Christian, and render him lovely and
   acceptable, and causes his smelt, to be as that of Lebanon? Some Jewish
   writers [544] refer these garments to the sacerdotal garments of the
   priests; which were certainly typical of those, which Christ, as our
   high-priest, wears, and with which he clothes his people.

Chapter 4 Verse 12

   A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse;
   a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having admired his church's faith and love, her language and
   her dress; proceeds to give farther commendations of her, and makes use
   of new metaphors to describe her by; in which he represents her as a
   well-watered and fruitful garden. First, He says, she is, "a garden
   enclosed:" the titles he gives her, "my sister, my spouse, have been
   explained in verse 8, 9. I shall only here inquire why she is called a
   garden, and that an enclosed one. And she is said to be a garden, 1.
   Because a garden is a piece of ground distinguished and separated from
   others for the owner's use: the church of Christ is distinguished and
   separated from others by electing and redeeming grace; by efficacious
   calling grace saints are also made to differ from others, and do in
   their lives and conversation live separate from them; and being set
   apart for God's own use, service, and glory, are a peculiar people to
   himself. 2. In a garden is a variety of flowers, herbs and plants: in
   Christ's church are many members, and those of different sorts; they
   have gifts differing from one another, and grace also; some have
   greater gifts, and larger measures of grace than others have; Put in
   them all there are many of those sweet flowers and precious plants. 3.
   In a garden, flowers, herbs and plants, do not grow up naturally of
   themselves, but are either set or sown; nothing but weeds grow up of
   themselves; so in Christ's garden, the church, and in the members of
   it, the graces of the Spirit do not grow up of themselves; they are
   sown, planted, and raised up by the Spirit of God; for in their hearts
   naturally grow nothing but the weeds of sin and corruption. 4. The
   ground must be dug and prepared far the setting of plants and herbs
   therein: the hearts of God's people before conversion are like
   fallow-ground; God is the husbandman, and they are his husbandry, this
   ground must be dunged, as well as dug, before it becomes good ground,
   or ever these flowers, herbs, and plants will grow there, which method
   Christ takes with his garden, and the several parts thereof. 5. To keep
   a garden in order, requires a deal of labor and care; the stones must
   be gathered out, the plants must be watered, the trees pruned, the
   ground dunged, and the fences kept up: all this, and much more, does
   Christ to his garden, the church; he gathers out those things which
   offend and hinder the growth of his plants; he watches over them night
   and day, and waters them, every moment; he lops off the fruitless
   branches, and prunes those that are fruitful, that they may bring forth
   more fruit, and keep up the fences thereof, that "the wild boar of the
   forest" may not enter in, and destroy his garden. 6. Gardens are places
   where persons delight to walk: Christ walks in his garden, the church;
   in the midst of his golden candlesticks; you frequently hear of him in
   this song, that "he is gone down into his garden, to feed" there, and
   "to gather lilies;" nay, he not only takes his walks, but takes up his
   residence in his church. 7. A garden is usually but a small piece of
   ground; and so is Christ's church, in comparison of the wilderness and
   waste places of the world; it is a little flock, a small remnant, a few
   that shall be saved. 8. A fruitful and pleasant place; and so is the
   church, when compared with the world, "which lieth in wickedness," and
   is overrun with the briars and thorns of sin.

   Also the church is said to be a garden enclosed, (1.) For
   distinction-sake: the church is by God distinguished from others; the
   fence with which it is enclosed, and by which it is made to differ from
   others, is the free, special, and distinguishing grace of God. (2.) For
   protection: Christ's church, as it is distinguished by God's grace, so
   it is protected by his power; he is "a wall of fire round about it, and
   the glory in the midst of" it; a noble fence indeed! a glorious
   enclosure! Jerusalem with all its mountains, and Zion with all its
   bulwarks, were not so well fenced as this. (3.) For secrecy: it is
   hidden from, and is not seen and known by the world; it is like a
   garden that is walled around, and closely locked and.5 barred [545]
   whose flowers emit a sweet and fragrant odor, but are not seen; the
   saints, though they are exceeding useful in the world, yet are not
   known by the world; but are hid and shut up till the resurrection-morn,
   when it shall appear what they really are, for at present it does not.
   (4.) It is compared to a garden enclosed, or locked and barred; for so
   the word [546] properly signifies, because it is not pervious to every
   one, neither ought it to be; every one has not a right to enter there,
   it should remain enclosed, bolted and barred, to all but those who
   believe in Christ; none ought to walk here but those who come in at the
   right door, Christ Jesus and every one that climbs up, and gets into
   this garden any other way, is reckoned by Christ as a thief and a
   robber. (5.) It is said to be a garden enclosed or locked up, because
   it is only for Christ's use; therefore, in verse 16 she desires him to
   come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruit:" for this garden is
   only, his, and the fruits of it for his use alone: in chapter 5:1
   agreeable to her request, he tells her, that he was come into his
   garden, had gathered the fruits of it, and had eat; it being his sole
   property, which others had no right unto, he keeps it enclosed, locked
   and bolted. The allusion perhaps is to a garden near Jerusalem, which
   Adrichomius [547] calls hortus regius, the king's garden, which was
   shut up, and was only for his use and pleasure; which is much more
   likely than what Mr. Maundrei relates [548] , that at a little distance
   from Bethlehem, are pools of water; and below those runs a narrow,
   rocky valley, enclosed on both sides with high mountains; which the
   friars will have to be the enclosed garden alluded to.

   Secondary, He says that she is "a spring shut up, and a fountain
   sealed:" I put these two together, because they seem to intend much one
   and the same thing; though perhaps the one may be more strongly
   expressive of the church's fullness and excellency than the other; a
   fountain may intimate a larger quantity of water than a spring, and
   sealing signify a stronger security than bare shutting; but are both
   designed to inform us, that Christ's garden was well watered, and that
   there is, no danger of the herbs, flowers, and plants withering and
   perishing.

   The Septuagint render the first of these expressions as before, kh~pov
   kekleisme&gt;nov, "a garden enclosed, or shut up;" and so do the
   Vulgate 6 Latin and Tigurine versions, reading ^n for ln; Cocceius
   translates, "a heap locked up;" and thinks the church is compared to a
   heap of spices or fruits, which are locked up in a private place, that
   they may not be spoiled nor stolen away from the owner: Christ's church
   congregated together is a heap, but not a confused one; it is like an
   heap of spice or fruit laid in order; nor is it a heap of any thing,
   but of sweet-smelling spices and pleasant fruits, such as are mentioned
   in verses 13, 14 to which add also, it is an heap that is valued and
   cared for, and therefore kept up safe under lock and key. The other
   version of "a spring shut up," is more usually received and
   acknowledged, both by Jewish [549] and Christian Expositors, which also
   our Translators follow.

   Now the church is said to be a spring and fountain from whence waters
   flow, to water all the plants in Christ's garden; which are either, 1.
   The graces of the Spirit, which are in her as "a well, and rivers of
   living water, springing up unto eternal life," John 4:14. and 7:38,39
   and are called waters, because they are of a fructifying and reviving
   nature; the plants in Christ's garden being watered with these, revive
   and lift up their heads, become green, flourishing and fruitful; the
   souls of God's children drinking them in, and being filled with them,
   become like a watered garden, whose springs fail not. Or else, 2. The
   doctrines of the gospel: the gospel is thought to be the fountain,
   spoken of in Joel 3:18 which should "come forth of the house of the
   Lord, and water the valley of Shittim:" it is with its gracious truths
   that the faithful ministers of the gospel water Christ's garden; the
   spirit of grace does it efficaciously, they do it ministerially; Paul
   plants, and Apollos waters, but God gives the increase; the doctrines
   of grace oftentimes flow in the ministry of the word, like floods of
   water upon the dry and parched ground, which soften, moisten, and make
   it fruitful; souls are refreshed, grow, and flourish thereby; their
   graces are revived, quickened and drawn forth into exercise, and every
   thing looks gay and beautiful, as in a fruitful and pleasant garden.
   Now we are not to suppose that the church is so properly this spring or
   fountain, as Christ and his Spirit are; she has not an indeficient
   supply in herself, she receives all from another; but because of the
   abundance of grace, and the means of it, which Christ is pleased to
   grant unto his church, therefore he calls her a spring and fountain;
   though she has grace enough to ascribe all the glory to him, and own
   him to be the alone spring and fountain from whence she is supplied, as
   in verse 15 will be made more manifestly to appear.

   Moreover, the church is said to be "a spring shut up, a fountain
   sealed;" springs and wells of water being highly esteemed, and much
   valued in those hot countries, were highly preserved; they used to roll
   a large stone at the mouth of them, and, for farther security, seal it;
   as that stone was which was laid at the month of the lions den, in
   which Daniel was cast; and that at the sepulcher in which Christ was
   buried: now these fountains were shut up and sealed, not only that the
   waters might not be bemudded by beasts, but also that they might not be
   converted to the use of others; thus it is reported, that, among the
   Persians [550] were such fountains that only the king and his eldest
   son might drink of; it being a capital punishment for any others to do
   so: and perhaps Solomon might have such a spring and fountain in his
   garden, which was shut up and sealed, and kept for his own private use,
   to which the allusion is here made; either at Jerusalem, or at Ethan,
   where he had a pleasure-house; which, for the delicate gardens, walks
   and fountains, and the fruitfulness of the place, he took great delight
   in [551] : and near the pools at some distance from Bethlehem, supposed
   to be his, is a fountain, which the friars will have to be the sealed
   fountain, here alluded to; and to confirm which, they pretend a
   tradition, that Solomon shut up these springs, and kept the door of
   them sealed with his signet, to preserve the waters for his own
   drinking: and Mr. Maundrel [552] , who saw them, says, it was not
   difficult to secure them; they rising under ground, and having no
   avenue to them, but by a little hole, like to the mouth of a narrow
   well.

   And if we apply this to the doctrine of the gospel, it intends, 1. The
   secrecy and hiddenness of them to the men of the world; "for if our
   gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, whom the god of this
   world hath blinded," says the apostle, in 2 Corinthians 4:3, 4 it is an
   hidden gospel to some, a book sealed both to the learned and unlearned,
   who are in a carnal and unconverted state: from many it is hidden, as
   to the external ministry of it; and to others it remains a secret, in
   the midst of the clearest light, and most powerful ministrations of it;
   it is shut up in parables, and appears to be nothing else but dark
   sayings to a mere natural man. 2. That they are peculiarly intended and
   designed for the elect of God: it is for their sakes he has sent it
   into the world; and for their sakes he will continue to keep it there,
   maugre all opposition, until every one of them are called by powerful
   and efficacious grace; "I endure all things," says the apostle (2 Tim.
   2:10), "for the elects sake, that they may also obtain the salvation,
   which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory;" that is, I preach the
   gospel: and in doing it, undergo all the sufferings I do, purely upon
   their account; that salvation may be brought unto them, and they
   brought at last into the eternal possession of it: and as it is sent
   into, and continued in the world for their sakes, so it is only blessed
   to them for conversion and consolation: though the gospel is preached
   to others, as well as to them, yet it does not Become profitable to
   them, because it is not mixed with faith by them; for whilst it is the
   "savor of life unto life" to some, it is the "savor of death unto
   death" to others; and though these waters of gospel-doctrines flow to,
   and fall upon others; yet it is but like water that falls upon a rock,
   that quickly glides away, and makes no impression; and not like streams
   of water which run about the plants, and soak to the very root. The
   elect of God are only savingly converted, refreshed, and comforted by
   gospel-doctrines; they are peculiarly designed for them, and eminently
   blessed to them; they are only for their use, and are to them "a spring
   shut up, and a fountain sealed." And if we apply it to the grace of the
   Spirit, it denotes, 1. That it is hidden, unknown, and is not
   communicated to any but to the elect of God: the natural man knows not
   the things of the Spirit, namely, the grace of the Spirit in
   regeneration and effectual vocation; these things are mysteries to him;
   he is a stranger to them, and unacquainted with them; they are only
   communicated to, and wrought in those to whom God would make known the
   exceeding riches of his grace: thus things are said to be shut and
   sealed up, which are kept secret and hidden, and are not conveyed to
   the knowledge of persons, as in Esther 8:16; Daniel 12:4-9. 2. That it
   is safe and secure: the grace of God's people is shut up and scaled; it
   can never be taken away from them; their life, and all their grace, and
   the fullness of it, "are hid with Christ in God"; and what is given
   forth unto them, and wrought in them, is an immortal seed and that good
   part which cannot be taken away. 3. It may intend the confirmation of
   it to the saints; so things are said to be sealed, when they are
   ratified, confirmed and made sure; grace and glory are both so to the
   saints; the Spirit is the author of their grace, and the earnest and
   pledge of their glory, by whom they are "sealed unto the day of
   redemption." 4. It may signify Christ's special property in his church,
   and her inviolable chastity to him; and this I take to be the most
   proper sense of all these expressions; she is "a garden enclosed, a
   spring shut up, a fountain sealed;" she is Christ's garden and none but
   his; Christ's spring and fountain, to which none has a right but
   himself; she is his spouse and bride, and no other's; and being
   espoused unto him, as a chaste virgin, by mighty grace is kept so. The
   Jewish writers [553] generally understand it of the modesty and
   chastity of the daughters of Israel; and this sense seems to be
   abundantly confirmed from Proverbs 5:15-18. "Drink waters out of thine
   own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well," etc. Let thy
   fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.

   Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits,
   camphor with spikenard.

   VERSE 14.

   Spikenard and saffron, calamus and

   the chief spices.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having compared his church to a garden, and observed that it
   was well watered, having in it a spring and fountain; he proceeds to
   shew the fruitfulness of it, that it abounded with the choicest trees,
   the most pleasant fruits, and the chief of spices. In explaining these
   words, it will be proper,

   I.To inquire what are intended by the church's plants.

   II.Why these plants are said to be "an orchard of pomegranates."

   III.Take notice of the several trees, fruits, and spices here
   mentioned, and what may be meant by them.

   I.Who are meant by the church's plants. The Targum and Jarchi expound
   it of the young men in Israel; and it is nor. unusual in scripture to
   call children plants (see Ps. 128:3, 144:12); therefore, by her plants,
   may be intended the members of the church, her children, young
   converts, believers in Christ, who are "planted in the house of the
   Lord, and flourish in the courts of our God:" these are not mere
   education plants, who spring up in churches, and join themselves to
   them, because their parents did; and espouse religion, because they
   were brought up in it: these are not mere outward profession-plants,
   who have a name to live, and are dead; have lamps, but no oil in their
   lamps; and have a form of godliness, fruit but deny the power thereof,
   such plants as these are fruitless ones; they are like the barren
   fig-tree, from which three years successively fruit was sought, but
   none found; if ever there was any appearance of fruit on them, it never
   came to any thing, but withered away; and whatsoever fruit they do
   bring forth, it is to themselves, and not to God; like Israel of whom
   it is said (Hosea 10:1), that he is "an empty vine, and brings forth
   fruit, to himself:" and the reason of this is, because they have not
   the root of the matter in them; nor are they engrafted into, and rooted
   in Christ Jesus; and therefore are like the stony ground-hearers, who
   heard and received the word with joy, but it did not last long, because
   they had no root in themselves; and such being none of the Father's
   planting, shall be plucked up, according to what Christ says (Matthew
   15:13). Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be
   rooted up;" and shall be bundled together, as fit fuel for the fire,
   like the unfruitful and withered branches, or like the tares in the end
   of the world: but these plants in the text, are such who, 1. Are by
   divine grace transplanted from the wilderness of the world, they are
   Christ's vines, which he brings out of Egypt; his fir and myrtle trees,
   which he causes to spring up instead of briars and thorns; these he
   either takes out of the wilderness, or else makes it a fruitful garden
   by planting them there; he calls them out of the world, and translates
   them into his own kingdom, whereby he enlarges his church, and of a
   garden makes it an orchard. 2. Who have the grace of the Spirit planted
   in their hearts; who works in them every sort of grace, which he
   raises, cherishes, and at last brings to perfection. 3. Who are
   engrafted into Christ Jesus: by nature they belong to, and grow upon
   the wild olive: but are by grace broken off from that, and are
   engrafted into the true olive, Christ Jesus; they are planted into the
   likeness of his death, and into the likeness of his resurrection, and
   so receive the benefits of both; they abide in him, as the branch in
   the vine, and, receiving sap and nourishment from him, become fruitful
   souls. 4. They are such who have received the engrafted word; it has
   been planted in them, and powerfully impressed upon them; they have
   received it in the love of it; it has effectually wrought in them, and
   brought forth fruit in them from the very day they heard and received
   it. 5. Such as these who are transplanted from the wilderness of the
   world, and are planted in Christ, and have had his word and grace
   planted in their souls, have a right to be planted ministerially in his
   church; and being planted there, will grow and flourish. Now such
   plants as these are choice and select ones; they are plants of renown,
   and pleasant ones to God and Christ; they are planted in a fruitful
   soil, and by rivers of water, therefore their leaf is always green;
   neither do they cease from yielding fruit; hence they shall never be
   plucked up; neither sin, nor Satan, nor the world can do it; and Christ
   Jesus never will; for they are his Father's planting, in whom he is,
   and will be glorified, and then is he so when they bring forth much
   fruit.

   II.These plants are said to be an orchard, or like unto an orchard of
   pomegranates. The word for plants, is by the Cabalistic doctors [554] ,
   rendered waterings or rivulets; which, being derived, make her a garden
   of pomegranates, as full as an orchard is of them: and it may be
   rendered gardens [555] ; particular churches, which make an orchard, or
   are like one; even a paradise, .as the word is rendered by the
   Septuagint, and in other versions [556] ; it is generally thought to be
   a Persiac word (see Neh. 2:8); but Hillerus [557] derives it from drp
   to separate; it being a garden separate and enclosed, as before one
   like Eden's garden, exceeding pleasant and delightful; and not like an
   orchard of any sort of trees, but of pomegranates; of which there were
   plenty in the land of Canaan; called "a land of pomegranates," (Deut.
   8:8) many places in it had their names from thence (Josh. 15:32, 19:13,
   21:24). And the church [558] , with her plants, may be called so, in
   allusion to the garden of Eden, the earthly paradise of our first
   parents; where the "Lord God made to grow every tree that was pleasant
   to the sight, and good for food;" in the midst of it stood the tree of
   life, and out of it went a river to water all the garden, and was on
   all accounts exceeding pleasant and delightful: in Christ's garden, the
   church, are planted all manner of trees of righteousness, which are
   both pleasant and profitable; God, stands the tree of life, in the
   midst of this paradise of Christ Jesus; but with this difference from
   the tree of life in Eden's garden; for Adam might not put forth his
   hand, and take of that; but of this, whosoever will, may pluck and eat,
   and happy is every one that does so: here runs a river of boundless
   love and grace, the streams whereof water and refresh all the plants
   herein; and upon all accounts is an Eden of pleasure, a paradise which
   Christ has made for his own pleasure and delight [559] , and for that
   reason bears this name: but these plants are not only said to be an
   orchard, but an orchard or paradise of pomegranates, that is, in which
   pomegranates grew in great plenty. The church, like the land of Canaan,
   is a land or orchard of pomegranates; and the church's plants,
   believers in Christ, who are planted and grow there, may be compared to
   pomegranates, that is, not to the fruit and shell, as in verse 3 but to
   the trees, 1. Because there are various sorts of them [560] , which
   bear fruit differing from each other; which may denote the difference
   there is in saints, by reason of their gifts and graces; they have
   grace and gifts differing from each other; one has more grace and
   larger gifts than other's have; they are not all of an equal size and
   bigness; they have not all a like measure of the Spirit, and yet they
   are all pomegranates, trees of righteousness, of the right planting. 2.
   Pomegranate-trees in some countries are very large; and so they were in
   the land of Canaan, as appears from 1 Samuel 14:2 and perhaps may here
   denote such who excel others in gifts and grace; who are officers in
   churches, and are set over others in and by the Lord; as by the other
   trees, fruits and spices, after mentioned, may be intended lesser
   saints, who are of a lower form in the church of Christ. 3. They are
   very fruitful trees: the fruit they bear, as it is full of a delightful
   juice, so of grains or kernels; which may denote the saints being full
   of grace, and all the fruits of righteousness and good works, as the
   Targum and Jarchi observe here. 4. They grow up straight and upright,
   and so denote the saints uprightness, both in heart and life; they are
   men of upright hearts, and of upright conversations; are looking
   upwards to, and growing up into their head, Christ Jesus. 5. They do
   not grow any where, in any soil; the wilderness, through which the
   Israelites traveled, could not furnish them with any, though the land
   of Canaan could when they came thither: these plants or trees of
   righteousness, do not grow any where; they are not to be found every
   where; they grow in Christ's garden; in his house they are planted, and
   in his courts they flourish.

   III.Here are several other trees, fruits and spices, which are said to
   be in this garden or orchard; for it is added, with all pleasant
   fruits; that is, whatsoever is valuable, precious, and desirable, such
   as those after mentioned; as camphor with spikenard; both these have
   been observed in chapter 1:12,14. but are here mentioned in the plural
   number, cypresses, or cyprusses with nards [561] ; the camphor, or
   cypress, on the account of its fruits or berries; and the spikenard,
   because there are various sorts of it, as nardus Italica, nardus
   Celtica, and nardus Indica, which last is the right spikenard; and it
   may be, because the leaves which grow out of the root, are like a bunch
   of ears of corn: saffron; it is no where else mentioned in scripture;
   we call it by this name from the Arabic, zaffran; it is called so on
   account of its yellow and golden color; its nature and usefulness are
   well known among us; according to Schindler [562] , it seems to have
   been read carcos, the same with crocus, which has its name from Corycus
   [563] , a mountain in Cilisia; so Pliny, lib, 21. c. 6. where it grew,
   and was the best; it is properly joined with spikenard, since itself is
   a spice, and is called spica Cilissa [564] ; it bears a blue flower, in
   the midst of which are three stylets, or little threads, of a fine red
   color, which are what is called saffron: calamus and cinnamon; both
   these were ingredients in the holy anointing oil, Exodus 30:23, both
   grow an India, and in Arabia [565] , and in Ethiopia; calamus is the
   sweet cane, mentioned in Isaiah 43:24, it grows in India and Arabia;
   and is said to scent the air, where and while it is growing, with a
   fragrant smell; and cinnamon is the middlemost bark of a tree, that
   grows in Ceylon in the East Indies; it is mentioned in Proverbs 7:17,
   as the harlot's perfume, and in Revelation 18:13, as part of the wares
   or merchandise of the whore of Babylon: some say [566] , what we call
   cinnamon is the cassia of the ancients; Herolotus [567] fabulously
   relates, what, from the Phoenicians, is called cinnamon, are stalks or
   barks, which the Arabs say, are found in the nests of certain birds.
   "With all trees of frankincense, myrrh;" frankincense chiefly grew in
   one of the Arabias, hence called thurisera; [568] and is said to come
   out of Syria; [569] it was used in the holy perfume, as was myrrh in
   the anointing oil, Exodus 30:23-34 which is a gum, from a shrub in
   Arabia, of a bitter taste, but fragrant; and with both these the church
   is said to be perfumed, chapter 3:6 and aloes; either the ling-aloes,
   so the Targum here, of which mention is made in Numbers 24:6. called
   agallocbium, an aromatic plant, which grows in India and Arabia, and is
   of a sweet odor, as Isidore [570] says; or the herb aloes, which is of
   a bitter taste, but of a sweet smell, and with which garments were
   perfumed, Psalm 45:8; Proverbs 7:17 together with all chief spices, or
   precious ones; Solomon's gardens might be furnished with these from
   Arabia Felix, where all sorts of spices grew, hence called aromatifera,
   the spice country: [571] and be they what they will, they are all to be
   found in Christ's garden, or what is answerable to them. Now by these
   may be meant, the several graces of the Spirit, which are to be found
   in all those who are plants or members in Christ's church; which are
   called by these names, and compared to these fruits, herbs, and spices,
   1. Because the graces of the Spirit are many, and therefore many herbs
   and spices are mentioned (see Gal. 5:22). 2. They are various, of
   different sorts; for as it makes for the pleasantness of a garden or
   orchard to have many trees, plants, herbs, and flowers, so to have them
   of different sorts; for if there were never so many, and all of one
   sort, it would not be so delightful: the church of Christ, and
   believers in Christ, as they have many, so they have various graces;
   there are faith, hope, love, etc. faith is a grace differing from hope,
   and hope differs from faith, and love from them both. 3. They are rare
   and excellent: the herbs and spices here mentioned, such as spikenard,
   saffron, camphor, cinnamon, etc. are not to be found everywhere; they
   do not grow in every garden; they are very rarely to be met with: the
   graces of the Spirit do not grow any where, in any heart; there are but
   few that have them; they are exceeding rare, valuable and precious. 4.
   These herbs and spices are all of them of a sweet smell: and so are the
   graces of the Spirit to Christ; they are a sweet perfume to him; the
   smell of these ointments is preferred by him to all spices, in verse
   10. 5. Some of these herbs and plants cheer the heart, [572] and revive
   the spirits, as saffron, cinnamon, and camphor: the Spirit of God, in
   his operations of grace, and in exciting and drawing forth grace into
   exercise, wonderfully cheats our hearts, revives our spirits, and keeps
   us from fainting and swooning fits: in the multitude of our thoughts
   within us, his comforts delight our souls. 6. Some of them preserve
   from putrefaction, as myrrh and aloes; and therefore were used in
   embalming dead bodies (John 19:39), the grace of the Spirit is of such
   a nature; it is by this our dead souls are quickened, by this they are
   kept in life, and are preserved from putrefying and rotting in sin. 7.
   Some of them are green in winter-time; as saffron and the aloe: [573]
   grace is always dive, and ever green, even in winter-storms and
   tempests, though it does not always appear so to us; it is an immortal
   seed which never dies. 8. Some of these grow up higher and taller than
   others; the calamus, [574] cinnamon, myrrh, and ethers, grow up taller
   than the spikenard and saffron: now these may intend the graces of
   faith, hope, and love, which rise upwards in their actings on the Lord
   Jesus Christ; and the latter, the graces of humility, meekness,
   lowliness of mind, etc. 9. All these emit the most fragrant odor, when
   they are either cut, bruised, or burnt; so do the graces of the Spirit,
   when they are exercised and tried in the furnace of affliction, 10.
   They are all, one way or another, more or less medicinal, and are
   healthful to the bodies of men; and so are the graces of the Spirit to
   the souls of men. Solomon understood the nature of all sorts of herbs
   and plants, and no doubt these are aptly chosen to set forth the graces
   of the Spirit by; and had we but his wisdom, we should know better how
   to apply them.

Chapter 4 Verse 15

   A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from
   Lebanon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having commended his church as a well watered garden, and
   declared her fruitfulness; she breaks forth in these words, and
   ascribes it all to him, saying, "O fountain of gardens, and well of
   living waters," etc. as the words are rendered by some: [575] though
   others [576] take them to be the words of Christ; but rather are the
   church's. It is true, as if she should say, I am a garden, and a garden
   enclosed by thy sovereign grace, where the streams and flows of thy
   grace run and water all my plants, and make them so fruitful as they
   are: but I am not the spring, the fountain from whence they flow it is
   thou who art the fountain of gardens, from whence I am supplied, and am
   put into, and kept in the flourishing condition I am; it is not owing
   to myself, but it is by thy grace I am what I am; and therefore I will
   ascribe all the glory to thee. So that the church here acknowledges
   Christ,

   I.To be "a fountain of gardens".

   II."A well of living waters." And,

   III.His grace to be like "streams from Lebanon."

   There seems to be a respect to several places called by these names:
   there was one called "the Fountain of Gardens," which flowed from
   Lebanon, six miles from Tripoli, and watered all the gardens about,
   whence it had its name, and all the country that lay between those two
   places: [577] and there was another, called "the Well of living
   Waters," a little mile to the south of Tyre; it had four fountains,
   from whence were cut various aqueducts and rivulets, which watered all
   the plain of Tyre, and all its gardens; which fountains were little
   more than a bow's cast from the main sea; and in which space six mill,
   were employed: [578] and there is a rupture in mount Lebanon, as Mr.
   Maundrel [579] says, which runs up in seven hours traveling; and which
   on both sides is steep and high, and clothed with fragrant greens from
   top to bottom; and every where refreshed with fountains, failing down
   from the rocks, in pleasant cascades, the ingenious work of nature: and
   Rauwolff, [580] who was on this mountain in 1575, relates; "We came,
   says he, into pleasant groves, by delightful rivulets that arose from
   springs, that made so sweet a noise as to be admired by king Solomon,"
   (Song 4:15).

   I.She acknowledges him to be "a fountain of gardens." By gardens may be
   intended, either particular believers, whose souls are made like
   watered gardens, whose springs fail not; or rather, particular
   churches: Christ has mere gardens than one; every particular church is
   a garden; such were the churches at Rome, Corinth, Colosse, Philippi,
   Thessalonica, and the seven churches of Asia; but though there have
   been, and still are many gardens, yet there is but one fountain, from
   whence they are supplied, and by which they are all watered, and that
   is the Lord Jesus Christ, as the church here owns; in him all fullness
   of grace dwells, and from thence believers "receive grace for grace;"
   he is the fountain from whence it all flows, all justifying grace flows
   from this fountain; in him alone is our justifying righteousness before
   God; by him are all the elect justified, and that from all things from
   which they could not be justified by the law of Moses; in doing which
   abundance of grace is displayed, both in bringing it in and applying it
   to the ungodly sinner; all which grace flows from this fountain: all
   sanctifying grace flows from hence; a holy nature, as well as a
   justifying righteousness, we have from Christ; he is both our
   sanctification and our righteousness; to him we must look for, and from
   him we must receive the one as well as the other: all the streams of
   pardoning grace take their rise from hence; Christ shed his blood to
   obtain the pardon of sin, and he has obtained it thereby for all his
   people; so that now as forgiveness of sin is according to the riches of
   God's grace, it is also upon the foot of justice, being founded upon
   redemption through the blood of Jesus; hence God's justice and
   faithfulness are concerned in the pardon of sin, as well as his grace
   and mercy displayed; Christ is "the fountain opened," to wash in "for
   sin and for uncleanness;" it is his blood alone which "cleanseth from
   all sin" whatever: He is the fountain of all the blessings and promises
   of the everlasting covenant; of all that light and life that we are
   made partakers of; of all that strength and wisdom that are given forth
   to us, to act for him in our several stations of life; and of all that
   joy, comfort, and peace in believing, which our souls are at any times
   possessed of: He is the fountain of all fructifying and persevering
   grace, by which the plants in his garden become fruitful, and continue
   to do so: in short, he is the fountain from whence all his churches are
   supplied not only with grace, but with the gifts of the Spirit; he is
   ascended on high, "that he might fill all things;" he is filled himself
   as man and mediator, with the Spirit without measure; he has received
   "the promise of the Father," and plentifully sheds it abroad among his
   people; he fills his churches with members and officers, and all these
   with suitable gifts and graces for their respective places; all comes
   from this "fountain of gardens."

   II.She declares him to be "a well of living water:" we read, in Isaiah
   12:3 of wells of salvation, in the plural number, which intend the same
   as here; and are so called to denote the fullness, completeness, and
   excellency of salvation in Christ: Christ is a well that is, 1. Large
   and deep; like that which Isaac called Rehoboth, either from the
   largeness of it, or the liberty he had then obtained in enjoying it; or
   like Jacob's well, which was very deep, at which Christ met the woman
   of Samaria: the fullness of grace in Christ has its heights and depths,
   its lengths and breadths; it is bottomless and unfathomable, it is
   immeasurable and incomprehensible. 2. Christ is a full well: we read, 2
   Peter 2:17 of some that are wells without water; but such an one is not
   Christ; he is a full welt, and not full of any thing, of any sort of
   water, but of living water; he is fur of grace and truth, 3. This well
   was dug by, and filled alone with sovereign grace; it pleased the
   Father; it was an act of his sovereign grace, that Christ should be the
   mediator, and that all fullness of grace should dwell in him as such;
   when he treasured up in him before the world began: the Lord, says
   Wisdom (Prov. 8:22), possessed me; with what? with all fullness of
   grace; and when did he do this? in the beginning of his way, before his
   works of old; O boundless, sovereign grace! 4. Faith is the grace with
   which we draw from hence: it may indeed be said to us, what the woman
   of Samaria said to Christ (John 4:11), "sir, thou hast nothing to draw
   with, and the well is deep:" we have nothing of our own to draw with;
   but Christ, who has opened our eyes, as the Lord did Hagar's, to behold
   himself, the well of living waters, gives us faith, whereby we draw out
   of the wells of salvation, and receive from this overflowing fountain
   grace for grace. 5. The waters we draw from hence are living ones; such
   Christ told the woman of Samaria he could, as undoubtedly he afterwards
   did give unto her, even living water. Christ is a well, and a well full
   of living waters; which are so called, (1.) Because grace given forth,
   from Christ's fullness to dead sinners, makes them alive; these waters
   are like the waters of the sanctuary, in Ezekiel's vision; which,
   wherever they come, not only keep alive those that are so, but quicken
   such who are dead in trespasses and sins, and in this respect excel
   them: we are told (Prov. 10:11), that the mouth of a righteous man is a
   well of life; certainly Christ's mouth is so, when he says to sinners,
   whilst in their blood, live; his grace may then be said to be living
   water. (2.) Grace given forth from Christ's fullness, revives and
   quickens saints when dull, lifeless and fainting; it comforts their
   hearts, and makes them cheerful, lively and active. (3.) Grace
   maintains and supports life in believers: we have our life alone from
   Christ; he is the author of it, and with him it is hid, secured, and
   preserved; it is by his mighty grace that our souls are upheld in it;
   from his fullness we have all the communications of it; and because he
   lives, therefore we do, and shall live also. (4.) It is this grace of
   Christ's that gives saints a right to, prepares them for, and will end
   in eternal life; justifying grace gives them a right to eternal life;
   sanctifying grace makes them meet for it, which is in them "a well of
   water springing up into everlasting life," (John 4:14). (5.) These are
   called living waters, because they are ever running [581] ; and so
   opposed to standing waters, which are dried up in the summer season:
   Christ's grace is perpetual, everlasting and inexhaustible; like
   himself, it is "the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever;" the fullness
   of grace in Christ, and the communications of it, are like those living
   or ever-running waters, mentioned in Zechariah 14:8. "And it shall be
   in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of
   them towards the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea; in
   summer and in winter shall it be;" that is, at all times and seasons of
   the year shall these waters flow: the saints before and after the
   flood, the saints before and under the law; the saints under the Old
   Testament, and the saints under the New, have all received from this
   fountain and fullness of grace in Christ; all the grace that angels
   have, and all that men have or shall have. all comes from hence; and
   yet it is an ever-running, overflowing, and inexhaustible fullness, And
   this I take to be the principal reason why it is called "living water."

   III.The church here acknowledges the grace of Christ to be like streams
   from Lebanon: mount Lebanon gave rise to Eleutherus, etc. and as these
   took some rivers, as Jordan [582] their rise and streamed from thence,
   so does grace from Christ, "whose countenance is as Lebanon," chapter
   5:15, who is intended here from this high, goodly, pleasant, fruitful,
   and fragrant mountain, flow all the streams of divine grace to our
   souls. Now by this expression are intended, 1. The discoveries and
   breakings forth of grace to those who are the objects of it: the river
   of God's love ran under ground from eternity; so that those who are
   interested in it, and are the objects of it, know nothing of it, till
   it breaks forth in effectual vocation; when it comes pouring in unto
   them, like streams from Lebanon. 2. This expression may denote the
   rapidity, force, and power of divine grace; as the streams from Lebanon
   fall with great rapidity: [583] grace comes like a mighty torrent, and
   carries all before it; throws down the strong holds of Satan, and is a
   match for the corruption of nature; for when this works, nothing can
   let; all mountains become a plain; all obstacles and impediments are
   removed out of the way; and nothing can stand before it, when the
   exceeding greatness of its power is exerted; it is irresistible,
   invincible, end always victorious. 3. This phrase maybe expressive of
   the abundance of grace which flows from Christ: there are aboundings of
   sin in our nature; but grace, streaming from Christ, abounds overall;
   where sin abounded, says the apostle, Romans 5:20 "grace did much more
   abound;" it flows into, and it overflows in a believer's heart; the
   grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, uJperepleo&lt;nekse, it
   abounded; yea, it superabounded with faith and love which is in Christ
   Jesus: there is an abundance of grace given forth to a single believer;
   how much then must it be that is given forth to them all! and how large
   that fullness which is in Christ! 4. Though this grace flows in
   abundance to poor sinners, yet it is in measure; grace is in Christ
   without measure, but in us in measure; it is in him as in a fountain,
   but is given forth to us in streams; and these streams should lead us
   to the fountain from whence they flow; for though we should rejoice in,
   and adore grace for the streams, yet we should not rest contented,
   without often going to the fountain itself. 5. The communications of
   grace are called streams, and said to be as streams from Lebanon,
   because they are exceeding grateful and delightful to souls; even as
   streams of water were in those hot countries: the streams which flow in
   this river of divine grace make glad the city of God; a spring of water
   to a thirsty traveler in the Arabian deserts, cannot be more welcome
   and delightful than the discoveries of grace, those streams from
   Lebanon, are to a believing soul; and therefore Christ is said to be
   "as rivers of water in a dry place, anal as the shadow of a great rock
   in a weary land," Isaiah 32:2. 6. It intends the continued supplies of
   grace to believers: grace is always running, streaming, flowing to
   them; could rue communications of grace be stopped, were those streams
   from Lebanon to cease; they would soon be in an empty, miserable, and
   wretched state and condition; but this "river of the water of life is
   proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb;" it ever did, and
   so it does still, and ever shall; "my God will supply all your need,"
   (etc., Phil. 4:19). 7. It intimates unto us the freeness of it; it is
   like the streams from Lebanon; it runs freely; whosoever will, may come
   and take of this water of lit e freely. The first of these expressions
   in the text, denotes the fullness of grace in Christ; the second, the
   perpetuity and inexhaustibleness of it; and this third, the exceeding
   freeness of it.

Chapter 4 Verse 16a

   Former part. Awake, O north wind, and come thou south, blow
   upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.--
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having taken notice of the fruitfulness of his garden, the
   church, in verse 12-14, and she, in verse 15, having acknowledged that
   it was all owing to himself, who is the fountain of gardens; he, in
   this verse, that nothing may be wanting to continue and increase the
   fruitfulness thereof, calls to the north and south winds, the one to
   awake, and the other to "come and blow upon his garden, that the spices
   thereof may flow out." The reason why I take these words to be the
   words of Christ, and not of the church, as some, [584] are, 1. Because
   the language seems best to suit with him; who has created the winds,
   and gathered them in his fist, and holds them there; who opens his hand
   and lets them loose, and can and does recall them at his pleasure; Who
   has his storehouse and magazines of them, and, when he pleases, brings
   them forth out of his treasures; who, in the days of his flesh, gave a
   surprising instance of his power over them, in rebuking the wind and
   sea, and commanding a calm, when the disciples, with others, were in
   imminent danger; which occasioned the men to say, "What manner of man
   is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him!" he can shut up and
   let loose the winds, when he thinks fit; he has them at his command,
   and uses them as he pleases; so that it may be truly said of him, what
   the heathen poet [585] said of his Jove:

   Protinus AEoliis aquilonem claudit in antris,
   Emittitque notum ; madidis notus evolat alis.

   2. It does not appear so agreeable that the church should petition
   Christ to let loose the north wind upon her; especially, if by it we
   understand, as I think we must, some rough dispensation of providence,
   as afflictions, temptations, etc., which though Christ knows they are
   wholesome and useful to his people, and he makes them so, and therefore
   in his wisdom and grace sends them; yet they are not desirable to the
   saints; they do not pray for them. 3. The person here speaking, claims
   a right and property in this garden, on which the south wind, is to
   blow. Now the church is not her own garden, but Christ's, as she in the
   following part of the verse acknowledges; therefore it appears to be
   Christ who here speaks, and says, "blow upon my garden." Taking them
   then to be his words, I shall now consider what he says. And,

   I.He calls to the norm wind to awake, "Awake, O north wind." Which some
   [586] understand as a command, to remove and be gone, and blow no
   longer upon his garden: in Psalm 107:25 we read that God commandeth,
   and raiseth the stormy wind; it is in the Hebrew text, dm[yw "and
   causeth the stormy wind to stand;" so that the raising of the wind, and
   continuing it, in that language was called a causing it to stand; and
   perhaps a recalling it was, as here, called an awaking or raising it
   up, in order to be gone: and there are some reasons which may be
   alleged why it may be supposed that it was not the design of Christ,
   that the north wind should blow, but rather that it should not, 1.
   Because it was now spring time; "the wither was past, the rain was over
   and gone; the flowers appeared in the earth, the fig-tree put forth her
   green figs, and the vines with the tender grapes gave a good smell."
   Chapter 2:11-13, and therefore it was time for the north wind to cease
   blowing. 2. It being a cold and nipping wind, would be hurtful and
   injurious to the plants in his garden, mentioned in verses 13,14, and
   therefore it may be supposed that he would not have it blow. 3. The
   verb yjwph blow, is in the singular number, and seems to be only in
   construction with the south wind; and therefore is alone ordered to
   blow, and not the north wind. 4. Winds diametrically opposite to each
   other [587] , as the north and south be, cannot blow together under one
   and the same horizon with a continued blast; for if they blow with
   equal force, they will hinder each other from blowing freely; and if
   one is more powerful than the other, the weaker will be obliged to join
   the other, or else subside; though winds contrary may blow together
   obliquely and sideways; but the more oblique they are, the greater
   tempest they raise, which cannot be supposed to be Christ's design
   here: and now, when he orders the north wind to awake, arise, and be
   gone, he intends every thing that may be noxious, hurtful, and
   injurious to his garden. Though others think the meaning of this
   phrase, "Awake, O north wind," is, arise, exert thyself, and blow,
   together with the south wind, upon my garden; and so the Jewish writers
   think, [588] , that both winds are designed to blow. The north wind,
   though a cold and nipping wind, yet Pliny says [589] , that it is the
   most wholesome wind that blows: and the scripture informs us, that
   though out of the north comes forth the cold; yet also from it proceeds
   fair weather; (Job 37:9-22) and Solomon tells us, that the north-wind
   drives away rain (Prov. 25:23), and then by the north wind, as I hinted
   before, we may understand rough dispensations of providence, as
   temptations, afflictions, etc. which Christ is pleased to suffer to
   come upon his people, and which he brings them under, for their good
   and his glory: and this shews, (1.) That none of these things come upon
   the saints without Christ's knowledge, permission, or appointment;
   there is not a wind blows upon them without his will and order:
   afflictions do not come out of the dust, nor trouble spring out of the
   ground, but are sent from heaven to the saints as covenant mercies; no
   temptation comes upon them, but what is common to man; and Christ takes
   care that they are not tempted above that they are able to bear, and in
   his own way and time gives them deliverance from it. (2.) These are all
   for their good; it is, if need be, they are in heaviness through
   manifold temptations; all adverse and rough dispensations of
   providence, all afflictions, work together for their good; they are all
   in mercy to them, otherwise he that holds the wind in his fist, would
   not suffer the blustering north wind to blow upon them. (3.) They serve
   to make the spices flow out; that is, they are useful for the trial,
   exercise, and increase of grace; tribulation works patience, and
   patience experience, and experience hope; that is, tribulation
   exercises and tries these graces, and makes them to appear more bright
   and glorious: the manifold temptations the saints are attended with,
   are suffered to come upon them, "that the trial of their faith being
   much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with
   fire, might be found unto praise, and honor, and glory, at the
   appearing of Jesus Christ," (1 Peter 1:6, 7).

   II.He calls to the south wind, to come and blow upon his garden. The
   church is compared to a garden, in verse 12, and why it is so, has been
   there shewn. Here Christ claims a property in it; and it is his, 1. By
   choice; he chose this spot of ground, and preferred it to all others,
   for this purpose and use. 2. By gift; he asked it of his Father, and he
   gave it to him; "thine they were, and thou gavest them me," (John
   17:6). 3. By purchase; he has bought it, and at a clear rate; not with
   corruptible things, as silver and gold, but with the invaluable price
   of his own precious blood. 4. By his powerful and efficacious grace,
   has distinguished and separated it from the wilderness of this world.
   5. He uses it as his own; he purchased and set it apart for his own use
   and recreation, and here delights to walk;" he is frequently to be
   found, seen, and heard of here: and this being his own garden, which he
   himself chose, his Father gave him, which he has purchased with his own
   blood, distinguished by his grace, and where he delights to take his
   walks; he therefore calls upon the south wind to blow upon it. And by
   the south wind, and blowing of it, I apprehend, is intended the Spirit
   of God, in his powerful operations, and special influences of grace, in
   and upon the hearts of God's people; and shall now consider how he may
   be compared,

   First, To the wind in general. The Spirit of God bears the same name,
   and several of the properties thereof are applicable to him. 1. The
   wind, as our Lord says, John 3:8, bloweth where it listeth; the Spirit
   of God is a free agent; he works how and where he pleaseth; he acts
   freely in the first application of grace to a poor sinner; and so he
   does in all the after actings, operations and influences of it, as well
   as in the donation of those gifts, which he bestows upon men for
   different purposes; for though there "are diversities of gifts,
   differences of administrations, and diversities of operations; yet all
   these worketh that one and the self-same spirit; dividing to every one
   severally as he will," (1 Cor12:4-11). 2. The wind blows imperceptibly;
   thou hearest, as Christ says in the above-mentioned place, "the sound
   thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; and
   so is every one that is born of the Spirit:" the workings of the Spirit
   of God in regeneration are invisible and imperceptible to the natural
   man; he can no more discern the Spirit's grace, than he can see the
   wind when it blows; he can no more tell from whence this grace comes,
   and how it is acted, than he can point at the treasures of wind, and
   tell from whence they take their rise, and why they blow sometimes one
   way and sometimes another; why sometimes only in a gentle breeze, and
   at other times rise to violent storms; why sometimes their drive on in
   a direct line, and at other times have a circular motion: and as he
   cannot account for these things, no more can he for the operations of
   the Spirit; for he neither knows his person nor his grace. 3. It blows
   powerfully and irresistibly; there is no stopping of it; it blows when,
   where, and how it listeth, for any thing that man can do; none but he
   who has created the winds, and gathered them in his fist, can rule them
   at pleasure; and, when he lets them loose, and gives them a command,
   they carry all before them; throw down houses, pluck up trees by the
   roots, rend the mountains, and break the rocks in pieces; for which
   reason the Spirit of God is compared to "a mighty rushing wind," (Acts
   2:2), which filled the house in which the disciples were, on the day of
   Pentecost, and filled them with extraordinary gifts: the Spirit of God,
   in his mighty operations of grace upon a sinner's heart, carries all
   before him; there is no withstanding his grace and power; he throws
   down Satan's strong holds, and demolishes the fortifications of sin;
   all mountains become a plain before him; and the whole posse of hell,
   and the corruption of a man's heart, are not a match for him; for when
   he works, none can let: he has conquered the hearts of the vilest and
   most notorious sinners; such as a Manasseh, a Mary Magdalene, and a
   persecuting Saul; there is no resisting his grace and the power of it,
   nor holding of his almighty arm. 4. The wind is of a purifying nature,
   therefore some call it nature's fan; it clears the air of infectious
   and noxious vapors; we are scarce sensible how much our health is owing
   to it; for without this, the air would soon be stagnated, and quickly
   destroy the life both of man and beast: the Spirit of God purifies our
   hearts by faith; width he does by leading it to the blood of Jesus,
   which cleanseth from all sin; and by sprinkling it upon our
   consciences, whereby they are purged from dead works; these dead
   weights and heavy clogs, which hinder us in serving the living God. 5.
   It is of a piercing and searching nature; it penetrates into every hole
   and cranny: the Spirit of God searches, not only the deep things of
   God, but the deep things of man also; what is said (Prov. 20:27), of
   the spirit of man, may in a higher sense be said of the Spirit of God,
   that it is "the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of
   the belly; it penetrates into the utmost recesses of a man's heart, and
   discovers those hidden swarms of corruption, which before lay
   indiscernible; it pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and
   spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is both a discerner and
   revealer of the thoughts and intents of the heart. 6. It is of a
   cooling nature; so is the Spirit of God, in his operations of grace
   upon a sinner's heart; which is often enflamed with wrath, through the
   workings of a fiery law, and the injections of Satan's fiery darts; the
   heat of which he allays, by acting as comforter, and as the spirit of
   promise, bringing home and applying to the conscience of the distressed
   sinner, the exceeding great and precious promises of the gospel, which
   cool and refresh, by removing wrath and terror from thence.

   Secondly, He may be compared to the south-wind in particular, 1.
   Because it blows warmly, brings heat with it, breaks up frosts, and
   thaws the ice; "when ye see the south-wind blow," says Christ, (Luke
   12:55), "ye say there will be heat, and it cometh to pass:" so the
   Spirit of God brings heat along with him to the cold heart of a sinner,
   "dead an trespasses and sins;" and by the mighty influence of his
   grace, thaws and melts his hard and frozen soul; and with his
   soul-warming gales, and comfortable discoveries of love, warms,
   enlivens, comforts and refreshes the saint, when in a cold lifeless and
   uncomfortable frame. 2. It brings serenity along with it: it is not a
   blustering and tempestuous wind, as the north-wind is; but is still,
   gentle and quiet; blows softly as Elihu said to Job 37:17. "Dost thou
   know how thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
   south-wind? the Spirit of God brings peace unto, and commands quietness
   in the heart of a distressed sinner, where were nothing before but
   storms and tempests: the fruit of the Spirit is peace, a conscience
   peace, "a peace that passeth all understanding;" which he works in the
   sinner's heart, by leading him to the person, blood, and righteousness
   of Christ. 3. It is very fructifying; by its warmth, together with the
   sun, it loosens the trees, and causes the sap to flow, which was
   congealed by the cold, and clothes them with leaves, flowers and fruit:
   the Spirit of God, by his mighty grace and special influence, makes
   souls fruitful in every good word and work. 4. The south-wind usually
   brings rain, hence it is called nubilus auster; [590] and therefore the
   poet represents it as flying, cum madidis alis, with wet and moistened
   wings. Pliny [591] says, it produces greater flood; than others do;
   which suits well with Junius's version, who renders the next clause
   thus, "let the waters flow through the spices thereof:" [592] the
   Spirit of God blows, and causes the floods of grace to rise; which,
   running about the several plants in the garden, makes them fruitful.

   Thirdly, According to the mind of some Expositors [593] , the Spirit of
   God is intended by both winds, the north and south; and that, 1. On the
   account of his different operations; for which reason we read of " the
   seven spirits" of God, (Rev. 1:4), not that there are so many distinct
   spirits personally existing; but by them are intended the variety and
   perfection of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit of God, who works
   them in, and bestows them on whom he will. 2. If the Spirit is intended
   by both winds, it may be expressive of the usual order of the Spirit in
   his operations: he is first as the north-wind, sharp and knipping: and
   then as the south-wind, warm and refreshing; he first acts the part of
   a convincer, and then that of a comforter; he first kills, and then
   makes alive; wounds, and than he heals; he humbles souls, and makes
   them low in their own eyes, and then exalts them: he brings them "into
   the wilderness," and then "speaks comfortably to them." 3. It may shew
   that Christ's garden stands in need of both winds: that the saints
   sometimes need the Spirit as a reprover, to bring them to a sense of
   themselves; as well as a comforter, to relieve them under their
   distresses: the cold and nipping north-wind, as well as the warm and
   comfortable south-wind. 4. Both winds are called upon, and that to
   cause the spices to flow out, that the odor of them may be spread far
   and near, that it might be carried from pole to pole, even all the
   world over. Now when Christ is here represented, saying to the Spirit,
   "come and blow upon my garden;" it must be understood of him as
   mediator, calling unto, and as it were demanding of the Spirit to do
   his work assigned him in the church which does not suppose any
   inferiority in the Spirit to Christ for all the three persons having
   jointly agreed in the everlasting council and covenant of peace, to
   take their several distinct parts in man's salvation; and the Father
   having distinguished this spot of ground, this garden, by his grace;
   and Christ having purchased it by his blood; and the Spirit having
   planted it with precious plants, herbs and spices; Christ calls upon
   him, by virtue of this former agreement, to do the remaining part of
   his work (see John 14:16, 16:7), to blow upon his garden, that it may
   grow and flourish, and the sweet smell of these spices be carried far
   and near. Which brings me to consider,

   III.The reason why he would have the south-wind blow upon his garden;
   and that is, "that the spices may flow out;" might emit a fragrant
   smell: though Virgil [594] represents the south-wind as hurtful to
   flowers, so it might be in Italy, where it dried them up, as Severius
   on the place observes; and yet be useful to them in Palestine, where it
   blew from the sea, by which the south is sometimes called (Ps. 107:3).
   Now by spices, we must understand the graces of believers; which, like
   spices, are rare, excellent, precious, sweet and odorous, especially to
   Christ Jesus, by whom they are preferred to all spices: and the
   "flowing out" of them intend, either, 1. The exercise of them: grace is
   not always in exercise, but is like flowers, shut up; or like plants,
   herbs and fruits, which seem to be withering; or like coals covered
   with ashes, that want to be "stirred up" [595] 1 or blown upon, as in 2
   Timothy 1:6, but this believers are not capable of doing themselves;
   for they can no more exercise grace, than they can work it of
   themselves: Christ knew full well, that this is the Spirit's work;
   therefore he calls upon him to blow, and thereby open these flowers,
   revive these plants, and blow off the ashes from these coals, and draw
   forth grace into exercise upon himself, the proper object of it. Or, 2.
   The evidence and shewing forth of it to others: Christ would not only
   have grace in the hearts of his people, but would have it exert and
   shew itself in the life and conversation; he would have these "lights
   shine before men," and this grace appear, not only to himself but to
   others. Or, 3. The increase of grace: that these herbs and plants might
   be fruitful, the spices smell, and the whole garden be in a flourishing
   condition; in short, that the Spirit would be ripening and bringing to
   maturity grace in the souls of believers, and finish what he had begun
   there. Or else, 4. The diffusive odor of them: that their, graces might
   emit such a sweet odor, both to himself and others, as a garden does,
   when, after a delightful shower of rain, the wind gently blows upon it.
   Which request, or rather demand of his, no doubt was answered, as
   appears from the following words.\

Chapter 4 Verse 16b

   Latter part Let my beloved come into his garden,
   and eat his pleasant fruits.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word north-wind being awaked, and the south-wind having blown
   upon Christ's garden, the church, according to his order, the spices
   did flow out; her graces were stirred up, and begin now to exercise
   themselves; which causes her, before he had well done speaking, and
   made a stop, to break forth in these words, and earnestly desire his
   presence and company in his garden; so that in this one verse we have
   both Christ and his church speaking. In these words are to be
   considered,

   I.A title or character she gives him; "my beloved."

   II.A request or invitation she makes him; to "come into his garden."

   III.Her end in it; to "eat his pleasant fruits."

   I.Here is a title or character which she gives him, "my beloved;"
   which, as it comes from her mouth, is expressive, 1. Of her love to
   him: he wag the object of her love, him whom her soul loved; and indeed
   how could she do otherwise than love so lovely a person, one who loved
   her so dearly, and had given such undeniable demonstrations of it?
   love, we usually say, begets love; and no wonder that Christ's love
   should beget love in her, when we consider his person, the nature of
   his love, and how undeserving she was of it. 2. Of her faith, as to her
   interest in him; she could point him out, and distinguish him from all
   others, and had strength of faith enough, to claim him as hers; faith
   and love go together, they are twins; they are born together in a
   regenerate soul, and grow up together; when one is in exercise, usually
   the other is also; for "faith works by love." 3. She makes use of this
   title as an argument to obtain her request, or make her invitations the
   more forcible: she who in this manner earnestly desires that he would
   come into his garden, was one who dearly loved him, stood nearly
   related to him, and had an interest both in his person and affections:
   arguments taken by the saints from their union and relation to Christ,
   and their interest in him, have very great influence upon him, and are
   not disregarded by him: David knew this, and therefore uses this way of
   speaking at the throne of grace, "I am thine", says he, Psalm 119:94,
   save me."

   II.Here is a request made, or an invitation given, by the church to
   Christ, to "come into his garden." By the garden is meant the church;
   and why it is so called, has been shown on 5:12, and in what sense it
   is Christ's, and how he came to have a right to it, and property in it,
   has been observed in the former part of this verse, where Christ claims
   it, and the church here owns it; he calls to the south-wind, and says,
   " blow upon my garden ;" she here says, "let my beloved come into his
   garden:" believers are willing to acknowledge that all they have, or
   are, belong to Christ; that they are not their own, but "are bought
   with a price;" and therefore all they have and are, are for his use,
   and at his service; which they openly declare, and would have others
   take notice of, and therefore say (Ps. 100:3), "Know ye, that the Lord
   he is God; it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves;" that is,
   who hath re-made as: we are new creatures in Christ, and are his
   workmanship, and not our own; "we are his people," in a way of special
   and covenant-grace; "and the sheep of his pasture," whom he has taken
   the care and charge of, as the great shepherd; has laid down his life
   for, and feeds and leads into good pasture.

   The next thing to be taken notice of, is, what is meant by Christ's
   "coming into his garden." There is a threefold coming of Christ,
   mentioned in the scripture.

   1st, His coming in the flesh. This was what the Old Testament saints
   earnestly desired, prayed and longed for: it was not only the wish of
   David, but of the whole church; he spoke the language of all their
   hearts, when he said, Psalm 14:7. "O that the salvation of Israel were
   come out of Zion!" This being long promised, and long expected, the
   faith of the saints sometimes grew weak and languid concerning it;
   therefore the promises which respected it, were frequently renewed and
   repeated, and the prophets bid to say, Isaiah 35:4, to them that were
   of a fearful heart, Fear not, be strong, your God will come and save
   you;" and when they by faith saw the time near at hand, and him
   approaching, they were filled with joy and exultation; hence it is
   said, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! behold thy king cometh unto
   thee," (etc., Zech. 9:9), but this, I apprehend, is not intended in
   these words of the church.

   2dly, There is his coming at the last day to judge the world, which is
   usually called his second coming; which is what the apostle intends,
   when he says, Hebrews 9:28. "Unto them that look for him, shall he
   appear the second time, without sin unto salvation." The first time of
   his appearing in the flesh, though it was without sin of his own, yet
   not without the sins of his people; which were imputed to him, charged
   upon him, and he answered for them; but when he appears the second
   time, it shall be without them, they being already expiated and atoned
   for. He came the first time to obtain salvation for sinners, and will
   come the second time to put them into the full possession of it; and as
   the first coming of Christ was desired by the Old Testament saints; so
   this is desired by the New Testament saints; who, upon Christ's saying,
   "surely I come quickly," answer, "Amen, even so come, Lord Jesus:" it
   will fill the saints with wonder and joy; for he, when he comes, will
   be both glorified in them, and admired by them, though it will strike
   the wicked with dread and terror, and fill them with the utmost
   consternation; for his coming will be "in flaming fire, to take
   vengeance" on them. But neither is this, I think, she coming intended
   here. But,

   3dly, There is a spiritual coming of Christ; which is, when he comes
   and pays a visit, grants his presence, manifests his love, discloses
   the secrets of his heart unto his people; which was what he promised
   his sorrowing disciples, when he was about to remove from them, and
   they were no longer to enjoy" his bodily presence; says he, John 14:18.
   "I will not leave you comfortless, ojrfanou&gt;v, orphans or
   fatherless, I will come to you;" which promise Christ made good unto
   them, as he does to all his people at one time or another; for, says
   he, (John 14:23). "If any man love me, he will keep my words; and my
   Father will love him, and we will come unto him:" that is, Father, Son,
   and Spirit, "and make our abode with him;" which is what the church
   desires here, that Christ would grant her his spiritual, gracious and
   comfortable presence, and that she might have more intimate communion
   with him. From whence we may observe, 1. That Christ is sometimes
   absent from his church and people: He does not always manifest himself
   unto them; he sometimes hides his face, withdraws his presence, and
   seems to stand at a distance from them; he is sometimes Deus
   absconditus, the hidden God; he was so to the Jews in the days of his
   flesh, and he is so sometimes to his own flesh for "he hideth his face
   from the house of Jacob;" his own church and people, for whom he has
   the greatest love and regard: not that Christ is ever really and wholly
   absent from his church; he is always in his garden; he has promised to
   be always with his people and ministers unto the end of the world, and
   his faithfulness stands engaged to make it good; but he does not always
   alike manifest himself unto them; they have not always alike views of
   his person, discoveries of his love, and enjoyments at his presence;
   which sometimes makes them say, with Job, "O that I were as in months
   past!" etc. nay, sometimes in their apprehensions he is entirely gone,
   which is the church's case, in chapter 5:9, and such is their
   infirmity, and the strength of unbelief in them, that they are ready to
   say, He is gone, and will never return more; and therefore, as David
   did, read all that in the affirmative, which you will find in Psalm
   77:7-9, though I do not think this to be the case of the church here;
   she seems not to be without the manifestation of Christ's love, and
   enjoyments of his presence, being in such a fruitful state, the
   south-wind having blown upon her, her grace appearing to be in
   exercise, and she in a comfortable frame; though she wanted more
   nearness to him, more intimate communion and fellowship with him:
   believers never think themselves near enough to Christ, nor never wilt,
   till they are with him in glory: the highest enjoyment of Christ here
   below, though exceeding ravishing and delightful, falls short of giving
   full satisfaction; for still the soul desires more and greater: the
   apostle Paul, who had as much communion and fellowship with Christ, as
   perhaps ever any man had on earth; and yet, when he had in view that
   eternal being with Christ hereafter, speaks as if he had never been
   with him here; all his communion with him here was nothing, when
   compared with that which he expected in another world, and therefore he
   had "a desire to depart, that he might he with Christ." 2. From hence
   may be observed, that Christ's presence is exceeding desirable to
   believers; this is the one thing they seek after, and cannot be easy
   without; which, when enjoyed, gives them the utmost pleasure, and fills
   them with inexpressible joy: and the reason why Christ's company and
   presence is so desirable to them, is because he is nearly related to
   them; he is their beloved, their head and husband; they are "members of
   his body, his flesh, and of his bones;" he is their "all in all;" and
   when he is in the garden [596] , all they want, and all they desire is
   there; for there is none in heaven nor in earth with them comparable to
   him; his coming revives the plants and herbs, and makes them fruitful;
   it causes the spices to flow, grace to appear in exercise; it is like
   "the rain, and as the latter and former rain unto the earth:" also it
   is doing the saints the greatest honor; they have reason to say, Whence
   is this to us, that not "the mother of our Lord," as Elizabeth said to
   Mary, but our Lord himself should come to us? and yet this honor have
   all the saints. Moreover, Christ's coming is always beneficial to
   believers; he never comes empty-handed; he never pays a visit, but he
   brings something with him; he never sups with his people, but he is at
   the charge of the whole entertainment. Again, it is Christ's presence
   that makes his garden, the church, an Eden of pleasure, a heaven on
   earth; which makes it a Bethel, and "the gate of heaven:" it is this
   which makes Christ's tabernacles "amiable and lovely, his ways, ways of
   pleasantness, and his paths, paths of peace;" it is this which makes
   his "yoke easy? And his "burden light," and all his commandments not to
   be grievous, but delightful; and when all this is considered, it is no
   wonder that believers are so desirous of Christ's presence and company
   in his garden. 3. Hence it appears, that Christ's granting his presence
   with his church, is an act of wonderful grace and condescension; and
   therefore she asks it as a favor of him; and a surprising instance of
   his grace it is, that he who is the high and lofty one, should
   vouchsafe his presence to such vile and unworthy creatures as we be.
   The Septuagint render it, "let him descend into his garden" [597] ;
   and, agreeable hereunto in chapter 6:2, he is said to be "gone down
   into his garden," intending his wonderful condescension: Solomon, at
   the dedication of the temple, said, "But will God indeed dwell on the
   earth?" We have reason to say with Judas, not Iscariot, "Lord, how is
   it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not unto the world?"
   especially when, with the centurion, we consider, that we are not
   worthy that he should come under our roof.

   III.The end of her making this request or invitation, is, that he might
   "eat his pleasant fruits:" in which may be considered, 1st, What these
   fruits are. 2dly, Whose they are. 3dly, That they are pleasant ones.
   And, 4thly, What is meant by eating them.

   1st, What these fruits are. By fruits are meant, either the graces of
   the Spirit, which are called "the fruit of the spirit," (Gal. 5:22), or
   else, the duties and services of God's people, their good works, which
   are performed in the exercise of grace, believers are "trees of
   righteousness;" and the fruits which they bear are called "fruits of
   righteousness;" being by grace made good trees, they bring forth good
   fruit, and are said to be " fruitful in every good work;" now these
   Christ is here invited to eat. The Targum expounds it of the offerings
   of the people, which God graciously accepted.

   2dly, Whose fruit is this, is the next inquiry; and they are said to be
   his, that is, Christ's: the garden is his, and all the fruit of it;
   only, as one [598] well observes, the weeds are hers; every thing else
   in the garden, that is either for service or pleasure, belongs to him.
   The graces of the Spirit are his, 1. He is the procurer and possessor
   of them; he obtained all grace for his church and people in the
   everlasting covenant; he then asked for it, and it was granted him and
   given to us in him, on condition of his performing certain articles
   then agreed upon; so that, as the glorious mediator of the covenant, he
   is "full of grace and truth, and from his fullness do saints receive
   grace for grace;" it is all lodged in his hands, and from thence given
   forth to us. 2. He is the author of all grace; he is said to be the
   author and finisher of faith; and as he is the author of that, so he is
   of all other grace; he gives it to us, and by his Spirit works it in
   us; he is the green fir-tree, from whom all our fruit is found, for
   otherwise we have none of ourselves. 3. He is the object of all grace,
   particularly faith, hope, and love; he is the person in whom we
   believe, trust and depend on for life and salvation; on whom our hope
   of glory is fixed, and to whom our love and affections are drawn; so
   that these fruits may be truly said to be his; also our duties,
   services, and good works, performed in the exercise of grace, are his;
   for, (1.) They are performed by virtue of union to him; and therefore
   the fruits of righteousness are said to be by Jesus Christ; and "as the
   branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine," no
   more can any bear fruit, or perform good works aright, except they are
   engrafted and abide in Christ: he is the root which bears the branches,
   and from whence they receive sap and nourishment, which causes them to
   abound with fruit; "the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit," says
   Solomon, 12:12. now the righteous man's root is Christ. (2.) They are
   done, "not in their own strength, but in his;" for without him they can
   do nothing; it is he who works in them, both "to will and to do of his
   good pleasure;" therefore they ascribe all their works, duties and
   services to him; and say, as the apostle did, when he had asserted that
   he had labored more abundantly than the rest of the apostles, corrects
   himself thus, "yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." (3.)
   They are designed for his honor and glory, when performed aright; they
   do not seek themselves, their own carnal interest, nor worldly
   applause, nor expect to merit any thing by them; but what they do, is
   in a way of obedience and gratitude to Christ, and that he in all
   things may be glorified; they are performed in his strength, and
   designed his use; and so are properly his; which being considered,
   destroys that notion which advances the merit of good works.

   3dly, These fruits are said to be pleasant, that is, grateful,
   well-pleasing, and acceptable to Christ; so are the graces of the
   Spirit, especially when in exercise, as appears from verses 9,10, and
   so are the good works of his people, when performed in faith, from a
   principle of love to him, and are directed to his glory; the smallest
   services of his saints to him, and the least acts of charity to his,
   are acceptable to him, when performed in the exercise of grace; and he
   will take notice of them, and openly declare it one day before angels
   and men, how well pleased he is with them.

   4thly, What is meant by eating them: and this intends Christ's
   acceptation of them, and delight in them, as also his enjoyment of
   them; the phrase of eating and drinking being; with the Jews,
   expressive of enjoyment: and it also farther declares, the church's
   acknowledgment of Christ being the owner of the garden; for who should
   eat of the fruits of it, but he who has planted it, and takes care of
   it, and to whom all the fruit belongs? Knowing it therefore to be so,
   she here invites him to his own; which invitation is not disregarded,
   but observed by him, as appears from the following words.

   Chapter 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   This chapter begins with Christ's answer to the church's request, at
   the close of the preceding chapter; in which he inform her, that he was
   come into his garden, as she desired; and gives an account of what he
   had done there; and kindly invites her, and his dear friends, to feast
   with him there, verse 1. Then she relates her case and circumstances,
   which followed upon her sleepy frame, and ungrateful carriage to her
   beloved; which he resenting, he withdrew from her, and this gave her
   sensible pairs, verses 2-6. Also what treatment she met with from the
   watchmen; her charge to the daughters of Jerusalem; and the questions
   they put to her about her beloved, verses 7-9, which led her to give a
   large description of him, by his several parts, head, hair, etc.,
   verses 10-15. And the chapter is concluded with a general commendation
   of him and his loveliness, and a claim of interest in him, verse 36.

     __________________________________________________________________

   first word verse properly belongs unto, and is a part of the preceding
   chapter. The bible, when first wrote, was not divided into chapters, as
   now it is: this is a work purely human and not divine, therefore liable
   to correction. And I much wonder that the authors of this work should
   begin this chapter with this verse, which ought to end the former, as
   both the words and sense of them manifestly show; for this chapter
   ought to begin at verse 2, where the church begins a new account of her
   state and case, and of some other remarkable occurrences which befell
   her, not hitherto spoken of. In this verse may be observed,

   I.Christ's reply to the church's request, in the latter end of the
   former chapter, where she desires and invites him to come into his
   garden.

   II.An account of Christ's carriage and behavior, or what he did when he
   came into his garden.

   III.A kind invitation given by Christ to his friends to feast with him.

   I.Here is a reply made by. Christ to the church's request or
   invitation; "I am come into my garden, my sister; my spouse." The
   titles which he gives her, have been already" taken notice of and
   explained, in chapter 4:8, 9, and this reply of his unto her may be
   considered, either by way of denial to her, so some [599] interpret it;
   as though Christ did not answer the church's wishes and desires, but
   rather gives a reason why he does not; and wherefore she had no reason
   to expect his presence a long time; because, says he, I have been in my
   garden already, and there I have gathered my myrrh and the rest of my
   spices; I have got in my harvest or vintage, and I have eat my honey
   and honey-comb, and drunk my wine and milk; and therefore to what
   purpose should I now come into my garden? thou canst not expect me,
   until more myrrh and ether spices grow: or else, as a correction of her
   mistake, as if he should say, Dost thou invite me to come into my
   garden, as if I was absent from it? thou art mistaken, I am always in
   it, and never out of it; and am now there, gathering my myrrh and
   spice, eating my honey and honey-comb, and drinking my wine and milk,
   From hence may be observed, that Christ may be in his church, among his
   people, or with particular believers, and they not know it; so God was
   in the place where Jacob was, and he knew it not: and thus it was with
   Mary at the sepulcher; Christ was at her elbow, and she knew him not;
   he speaks to her, and yet she is ignorant, and takes him for the
   gardener, until he calls her by her name, Mary, and theft she knew him,
   and turns herself, "and saith unto him, Rabboni, that is to say,
   master." Though I rather think the words are to be taken as a direct
   answer of Christ's to the church; she desires and invites him to come
   into his garden, and accordingly he does come, and lets her know of it:
   in which we may take notice, 1. Of the speediness of it; she no sooner
   asks, but it is granted; no sooner invites, but he comes; and before
   she had well done speaking, makes a reply; his answer was ready; he was
   as willing to come, as she was to desire him; which makes good what is
   said in Isaiah 65:24. "And it shall come to pass, that before they
   call, I will answer," that is, will be ready to give an answer; " and
   while they are yet speaking, I will hear:" a famous instance of this
   kind we have in Daniel; who, "while he was speaking in prayer," and
   confessing to God his own sins, and the sins of his people, the angel
   Gabriel was caused to fly swiftly to him; who informed him, that at the
   beginning of his supplications, as soon as the good man was on his
   knees, and had opened his mouth in prayer to God, "the commandment came
   forth," orders were given, and he, as a messenger from heaven,
   dispatched to bring him an answer; but God does not always do so; "the
   vision is for an appointed time," and must he waited for till it comes.
   2. The nature of this answer is worth observing, being exactly
   according to her request; Christ does not always do so: when the
   apostle Paul had "a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet
   him," he besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from him; but
   it does not appear by the answer which was given him, that his request
   was granted immediately; the answer, "My grace is sufficient for thee,"
   was a very glorious one, enough to support him under his present
   exercise, but gives us no intimation that it immediately freed him from
   it; it being sometimes most for our good and for God's glory, not to be
   immediately and exactly answered: but here, as she was answered
   speedily, so exactly; she desires him to "come into his garden, and eat
   his pleasant fruits;" he tells her, that he was come into his garden,
   and did eat his honey-comb with his honey: which shews, 3. That her
   request was according to his will, in that she was answered so speedily
   and exactly; for "if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth
   us; and therefore our great concern in prayer should be, that we might
   be under the directions and influences of the Spirit of God, and that
   he would make intercession for us, according to the will of God, who
   perfectly knows it; and when we ask a favor or entreat a blessing, it
   should be always with submission to the divine will, in imitation of
   our dear Lord, and so shall we be most likely to succeed. 4. It may be
   observed, that Christ not only answers her, but lets her know it; not
   only grants his presence, but gives her intimations of it; he himself
   acquaints her with it; for, as has been observed, Christ may be present
   with believers, and they not know it: so he was with the two disciples
   who were going to Emmaus; he walked with them, conversed with them,
   opened the scriptures to them, and their hearts burned within them
   while he did so; and yet they knew him not, till he was made known to
   them in breaking of bread: it is not only an instance of Christ's grace
   to be present with us, but also to assure us that he is so. I have
   shewn in chapter 4:16, what is intended by Christ's coming into his
   garden; and therefore,

   II.Shall now proceed to take notice of his carriage and behavior there,
   or what he declares he did, or was doing; being there.

   1st, He says, "I have gathered my myrrh with my spice? Myrrh is one of
   the chief spices, was a principal ingredient in the holy anointing oil,
   and was used in other ointments. We read of the oil or ointment of
   myrrh, in Esther 2:12, with which Esther and the other maidens were
   purified, in order to be presented to king Ahasuerus: this, and other
   sorts of ointments, as spikenard, were used in feasts, and were poured
   upon the heads of those who were the guests, as appears from Mark 14:3,
   to which custom the Psalmist alludes (Ps. 23:5). Christ being about to
   make a feast, not only for himself, but for others, gathers myrrh, with
   other spices, to make an ointment of, to entertain and refresh his
   guests with. By myrrh, with the rest of spices, may be meant, either
   repentance and humiliation for sin, and mortification of it, according
   to some interpreters; [600] and indeed repentance and humiliation for
   sin, when evangelical, being the work of the blessed Spirit, springing
   from right principles, and kata Qeo&lt;n, according to God's mind; when
   it arises from an apprehension of sin, as committed against a God of
   love and grace; and when it springs from faith's viewing a crucified
   Christ; though, like myrrh, it is bitter to the soul, yet is odorous
   and well-pleasing to Christ; it is taken notice of by him, as Ephraim's
   bemoanings, repentance and humiliation, were by God; he has a bottle to
   put such tears as these in, which drop from faith's eye: and so
   mortification of sin, considered as the Spirit's grace, is regarded by
   him, according to Romans 8:13. "If ye, through the spirit do mortify
   the deeds of the body, ye shall live." Or else, according to others
   [601] , by myrrh with other spices, are intended the suffering saints
   and martyrs, who have undergone bitter afflictions and persecutions for
   Christ and his gospel; whom he values, esteems, takes notice of, and
   gathers into his Father's house; where he clothes them with white
   robes, puts palms in their hands, and everlasting hallelujahs in their
   mouths (see Rev. 7:9-14), or rather, the sufferings of Christ himself,
   and the fruits thereof; which, though bitter to him, yet are of a
   sweet-smelling savor to God the Father, and to all the saints; the
   fruits of which, appearing in the everlasting salvation of his people,
   are very delightful to him; for he now sees of the "travail of his
   soul, and is satisfied;" he is now reaping with pleasure a glorious
   harvest of all his sweat, toil and labor. Though I rather choose to
   understand hereby in general the graces of the Spirit, which Christ
   delights in, and which go under the name of myrrh and other spices, in
   chapter 4:13,14. Christ having got in his harvest, as the word
   signifies, and the Septuagint render it, provides a feast for himself
   and others; as was the custom of those times and nations, as it is now
   with us. And therefore,

   2dly, He says, "I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey." Honey was the
   food, not only of infants, but of grown persons, as is manifest from
   Isaiah 7:22, but that he should eat the honeycomb with it, seems to
   have some difficulty in it. The Septuagint read it thus, I have eaten
   my bread with my honey [602] , that is, either bread dipped in honey,
   or honey being put upon it, or else bread made with it; which sense is
   favored by those words in Ezekiel 16:13. "Thou didst eat fine flower,
   and honey, and oil," that is, bread made thereof: R. Sol. Jarchi says,
   it is the honey which grows in canes; he means, sugar, which, by
   Arrianus [603] , is called me&gt;li kala&gt;minon; and that for the
   exceeding love he had for it, he is said to eat it out of the cane; but
   it rather seems to be a piece of an honeycomb full of honey, just took
   out of the hive; such an one as the disciples gave Christ; and this was
   had in no small esteem among the Jews. The word for honeycomb signifies
   a wood or forest [604] , and may design such honey as was found in
   woods; though here, it should seem, in a garden, of which there was
   plenty in Judea (1 Sam. 14:25), which of its own accord dropped from
   the comb, and ran down the tree from it, in which it was, and was
   reckoned the purest honey: and the other word for honey, may signify
   common honey, or honey made of the fruit of the palm-tree; which, the
   Jewish writers say, is the honey meant in Deuteronomy 8:8, [605] and so
   the words may be rendered, "I have eaten my wood-honey with my
   palm-honey;" for it cannot be thought that the honey and the comb were
   both eat together. And by the honey and honeycomb, may be meant the
   doctrines of the gospel, or the words of Christ's mouth, which are said
   to be sweeter than the honey or the honey-comb:" so that Christ
   delights, not only in the graces of the Spirit, but also in the
   doctrines of the gospel, and the preaching of them.

   3dly, He says, "I have drunk my wine with my milk." Having eat, he
   drinks, to shew that he had a complete feast, and nothing was wanting
   to give him satisfaction; not only wine, but milk was used for drink,
   by many nations, and no doubt by the Hebrews: we find that Jael gave
   Sisera milk to drink when he was thirsty, as being preferable to water;
   but that wine and milk should be drank together, is not so usual;
   though it may be observed, that a mixture of wine and milk was used by
   the ancients [606] , and is by us, which, Clemens of Alexandria says
   [607] , is a very profitable and healthful mixture. Some of the Jewish
   writers think, that by wine, is meant red wine, and by milk, white
   wine; and so the Targum expounds the words of God's acceptation of the
   drink-offering of red and white wine, which the priests poured upon the
   altar: R. Aben Ezra gives it as the sense of some of their Rabbins,
   though he does not approve of it; that by milk, is meant the white
   which ascends upon the wine; I suppose he means the froth or head that
   is made by pouring it out. But to leave these empty conjectures, this
   seems in general to intend the plenty of provisions, and satisfaction
   therein, which Christ found in his church; by which may be meant the
   doctrines of the gospel. Gospel grace is represented hereby, in Isaiah
   55:1. "By wine and milk, without money and without price:" wine revives
   and cheats the spirits, makes a man to forget his poverty, and to
   remember his misery no more; so do the doctrines of the gospel, when
   they come with power to a poor sinner, sensible of his poverty and
   misery; they make him to forget it, and fill him with an unspeakable
   joy: milk nourishes and strengthens; and so do the doctrines of the
   gospel; therefore says the apostle, "I have fed you with milk," meaning
   the wholesome and nourishing words of faith. Now from all this I would
   observe, 1. That here is a variety: as at a feast, there is a variety
   of dishes, different sorts, both for eating and drinking; so here are
   myrrh and spice, honey, and the honeycomb, wine, and milk. 2. That here
   is nothing but what is sweet, savory and wholesome; myrrh and spice are
   of a delightful odor; honey is sweet to the taste, and. Wine and milk
   are wholesome and nourishing. 3. That all these are Christ's own; it is
   his own he feasts and makes himself welcome with; he does not say, "I
   have gathered thy myrrh with thy spice," which grow in thy garden; "I
   have eaten thy honeycomb with thy honey; I have drunk thy wine with thy
   milk;" but it is my myrrh and my spice, my honey" and my honeycomb, my
   wine and my milk: Christ would have but a poor entertainment, if he had
   no other than what we can provide for him of our own. 4. Christ appears
   exceedingly delighted and well pleased with all this; therefore he
   plucks and gathers, eats and drinks: the smallest degree of grace, and
   the weakest performances of his people, he takes notice of and regards;
   he eats his honeycomb, as well as his honey, and drinks his milk, as
   well as his wine; for a "bruised reed shall he not break, and the
   smoking flax shall he not quench."

   III.In these words is also an invitation of Christ to his friends to
   eat and drink; he is not willing to eat his morsel alone; as he feeds,
   feasts, and delights himself in the graces of his own Spirit in his
   people, so he will have them feed and feast upon his person and grace;
   into whatsoever heart Christ comes, he will not only sup with them, but
   will make them also sup with him. And here are to be considered, 1st,
   The persons whom he invites. 2dly, What it is he invites them to.

   1st, Who the persons are whom Christ invites; and they are here called
   friends and beloved; by whom are meant, not the angels, which is the
   mind of some [608] ; though it is true, they are Christ's friends, and
   rejoice at the conversion of elect sinners, and in the prosperity of
   his church and people; yet I think they are not intended here: nor the
   priests, whose right it was to eat the remainder of the sacrifices, as
   many Jewish writers [609] expound the words: but rather believers in
   Christ, who of enemies are made friends; being first reconciled to God
   by the death of Christ, and then to himself by his Spirit and grace;
   whom he regards and treats as such, by granting them his presence,
   paying them visits, and disclosing the secrets of his heart unto them;
   and so he said to his disciples (John 15:14, 15), "Henceforth I call
   you not servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth; but
   I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my
   Father, I have made known unto you:" now these are enabled, through
   divine grace, to shew themselves friendly to Christ again, by valuing
   his presence, delighting in his company, regarding his ordinances, and
   observing his commands; for though these things do not make friends,
   yet they shew them to be so; as Christ says, "Ye are my friends, if ye
   do whatsoever I command you." These are also the beloved of his soul;
   he has loved them with an everlasting love, and has given the fullest
   proofs and clearest demonstrations of it that possibly can be; which
   being manifested to their souls, begets love to him again; on the
   account of which he calls them friends and beloved. But,

   2dly, It will be proper to consider what he invites his friends and
   beloved to; to eat and drink, yea, to drink abundantly: but what is it
   they are to eat and drink of, or to feast upon? why, Christ himself,
   who is the bread of life, and the hidden manna, whose flesh is meat
   indeed, and whose blood is drink indeed; which if a man eats, and feeds
   upon by faith, he shall never hunger, nor die the second death, hut
   live for ever: moreover, his love is what they ate to drink of, and
   that largely; it being preferable to wine, may be drank of, without
   danger, plentifully; they may drink, yea, be inebriated with loves
   [610] , as the words may be rendered; for here is enough of it, and no
   fear of receiving any danger by it; and all this together makes up that
   feast of fat things, of wines on the less well refined, which the
   Lord's supper is a representation of. And this shews, 1. The
   plenteousness of the provisions which Christ makes in his house for his
   people: it is not an empty house that Christ keeps, a niggardly feast
   that he makes; but here is food, and that in plenty, and drink enough
   and to spare. 2. That a believer is heartily welcome to the
   entertainment which Christ makes: it is true, we are unworthy creatures
   of ourselves; but seeing Christ has made such entertainments for us,
   and has so kindly invited us, let us use freedom and eat; and the more
   heartily we feed on these royal dainties, the more welcome we are; and
   to assure believers that they are so, he, in his invitation to them,
   gives them the titles of friends and beloved: nay, the very manner of
   the invitation, not only declares the plenteousness of the feast, but
   also the largeness and sincerity of his heart in it. 3. It also lets us
   know, that Christ neither invites nor allows any to feed and feast with
   him, but those who are his friends, whom he accounts and makes so; this
   is a privilege peculiar to them, which indeed none can enjoy but they.
   And as for the external ordinance of the Lord's supper, that feast of
   love, none have a right to eat of it, but those who are Christ's
   friends; and to none but those is it profitable and edifying; for he
   does not manifest himself, nor discover his love to any other: these
   are his darlings and favorites; with these he grants his presence at
   his table, and satisfies their souls with the goodness of his house.

Chapter 5 Verse 2

   I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that
   knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, ray dove, ray
   undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and ray locks with the
   drops of the night.

   first word are the words of the church, who here begins to give an
   account of her present state and condition; how that after this
   spiritual banquet, which she had partook of with Christ, she fell
   asleep, as the disciples did in the garden, after they had been with
   Christ, at his table: and also, what methods he made use of to awake
   her; how basely and ungratefully she treated him; which he resented,
   and shewed by a departure from her; which when she was sensible of, was
   troubled at, and made enquiry after him, first of the watchmen, who
   abused her, and then of the daughters of Jerusalem, who question her
   about him; which gave her occasion to give that large and excellent
   account of him, which closes this chapter: and it may be observed, that
   as Christ speaks most in the preceding chapter, so she does in this. In
   these words are these two things,

   I.The church's account of her present state and condition.

   II.Christ's carriage and behavior to her in this condition.

   I.The account she gives of her present state and condition; "I sleep,
   but my heart waketh:" like persons half awake and half asleep, whom
   Cicero [611] calls semisomni; the phrase is sometimes used to describe
   a sluggish, slothful man. [612] This case which the church was now in,
   is different from that recorded in chap. in. there she was upon her bed
   indeed, but not asleep; there she was seeking after her beloved; but
   here he is seeking to her, and entreating her in the most kind and
   affectionate manner to arise, and let him in; there she of her own
   accord arose and sought him in the streets and broad ways; but here she
   continues in this sleepy and lazy condition, notwithstanding the
   pressing instances and powerful arguments which he made use of, until
   he exerted his mighty grace, which caused her to arise and open to him;
   but then he was gone: there she inquires of the watchmen, who, though
   we do not read of any answer they gave her, yet they did not abuse her;
   but here they smite her, wound her, and take away her veil from her;
   there, a little after she had passed from them she found him; but here
   she appears to be even sick of love before she found him. In this
   account of hers, two things are asserted by her, First, That she was
   asleep. Yet, Secondly, Her heart was awake.

   First, She acknowledges that she was asleep. "I sleep." This is not the
   dead sleep of sin, in whom all unconverted per. sons are; nor that
   judicial slumber, which God suffers to fall upon some; but such an one,
   which though displeasing to Christ and unbecoming the believer, yet is
   consistent with a principle of grace. The church here was not so fast
   asleep, but she could hear, know, and distinguish the voice of Christ;
   her sleep is much the same with that of the wise virgins, who all
   slumbered and slept, as well as the foolish, and yet had oil in their
   lamps, which they had not. And in taking notice of this part of the
   church's case, I will endeavor, 1st, To shew wherein this sleepy frame,
   which sometimes attend believers, does consist, or wherein it shews
   itself. 2dly, What are the springs and causes of it, or from whence it
   proceeds. 3dly, The danger of such a frame.

   1st, It will be proper to shew wherein this sleepy frame of spirit does
   consist, or wherein it shews itself, 1. It consists in a non-exercise
   of grace; though there is grace in the heart, yet it is but very little
   exercised by persons in this condition, it lies dormant; faith is weak
   and languid, hope abates in its former liveliness, and love in its
   warmth and fervency; it grows cold; there is such a thing as a leaving,
   though not a losing our first love. 2. It appears in a sluggishness and
   slothfulness to or in duty; for though persons have not wholly cast off
   the fear of God, and restrained prayer before him, as Eliphaz, Job 15:4
   wrongfully charged Job; yet there is a backwardness to it, and a
   laziness appears in the performance of it; there is a want of that
   fervency and spirit, which formerly discovered itself whilst they were
   serving the living God. 3. It manifests itself in a contentation in the
   external parts of religion: Internal religion is at a low ebb in their
   souls; they hear, and read, and pray, and attend on ordinances,
   contenting themselves with the bare performance of these things,
   without having their hearts engaged, their faith in exercise, and their
   affections raised; and so come short of answering the character of
   being worshippers of God in the spirit; either under the influences of
   the eternal Spirit, or with their own spirits influenced thereby, which
   formerly was their great concern in religious worship. 4. It discovers
   itself in a carelessness, lukewarmness, and unconcernedness for the
   cause of Christ: persons in such a condition may be observed sensibly
   to abate in their zeal, both for the doctrines of the gospel, and the
   46 discipline of God's house; they seek their own things, and not the
   things which are Jesus Christ's; they mind their own celled houses, and
   let the house of God lie waste; they come far short of imitating
   Christ, their glorious head, of whom it is said (Ps. 69:9), that the
   zeal of God's house eat him up; things may go how they will for ought
   they care, who have got into this frame of spirit. 5. It shews itself
   in an unconcernedness, as to omission of duty, and commission of sin:
   time was, when these persons could not omit a duty occasioned by the
   hurrying business of life, but it gave them great uneasiness; could not
   do those things which by some are not accounted sinful, but it burdened
   their consciences; but now they can neglect duties time after time,
   fall in with the customs and corruptions of the age, and be very little
   concerned about it. 6. In a willingness to continue so: they do not
   love to be jogged; grow peevish when any attempts are made to awaken
   them; their language is that of the sluggard (Prov. 6:10), "yet a
   little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
   sleep." This seems to be the case of the church, who being asleep, did
   not care to be disturbed; and therefore made those idle excuses she
   did, when called upon in the most tender and affectionate manner to
   arise.

   2dly, What are the true springs and causes of this sleepy frame, or
   from whence it does proceed, 1. From a "body of sin" they carry about
   with them; which fleshly, gross and earthly part in them, induces
   heaviness, and inclines to sleep: the cold humors of sin benumb the
   soul, and bring upon it a spiritual lethargy; "like the poison of
   asps," it operates this way; the deceitful charms of sin sometimes lull
   them asleep. 2. Worldly cares have sometimes this effect upon God's
   people; an immoderate thirst and pursuit after the things of this
   world, oftentimes makes persons grow indifferent about the things of
   another; it runs them into many temptations and snares; it frequently
   causes them to omit private and family duty, and " chokes the word" and
   ordinances, that they become unfruitful; being surfeited and
   overcharged with it, they fall into this drowsy and sleepy frame. 3. It
   arises sometimes from a cessation from spiritual exercises; idleness,
   or a want of exercise induces sleep: when believers grow weary of
   well-doing, and grow remiss in the duties of meditation, prayer,
   hearing and reading; grace, as to the exercise of it, declines, and
   their souls fall into a spiritual slumber. 4. It sometimes springs
   from, and is increased by an absenting from the ministry, especially an
   awaking one, which might be useful to rouse them; and from the company
   of lively Christians by conversing with whom, their souls, through the
   blessing of divine grace, might be kept awake; but instead of this,
   they" neglect the ministry of the word, leave off the company of those
   warm and lively souls, and converse with cold and formal professors,
   which bring them into, and continues them in this sleepy frame. 5.
   Sometimes it follows upon an enjoyment of ease, peace and liberty;
   therefore some [613] interpret these words of the state of the church
   in Constantine's time, when the church not only enjoyed freedom from
   persecution, but also abounded in riches and prosperity, and upon it
   grew careless, secure and sleepy; by reason of which many errors, both
   in doctrine and discipline, crept into the church; and I am afraid,
   that the long enjoyment of peace and liberty which we have had, has
   brought us into much the same frame of spirit.

   3dly, The danger of being in such a state and condition, 1. When the
   church of Christ is in such a condition, it lies liable to be filled
   with hypocrites, and pestered with heretics: to be filled with
   hypocrites, because it has not then such a spirit of discerning; these
   may then more easily impose themselves upon it: to be pestered with
   heresies and heretics, of which there have been lamentable instances,
   that "while men slept, the enemy sowed tares;" which roots of
   bitterness have sprung up with the wheat of sound doctrine, and have
   troubled some, and defiled others; and I wish I could say, that this is
   not the case of the churches of Christ now, nor these the dreadful
   consequences of her being in such an one. 2. Particular believers, who
   are got into this sleepy and drowsy frame, are exposed to every sin and
   every temptation; therefore said Christ to his disciples, Matthew
   26:41, "watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation;" knowing,
   that when asleep, they might easily be led into it: What may not the
   "devouring lion" be suffered to do to persons in such a condition? Into
   what sins and snares may he not be permitted to lead them, though he
   shall never destroy them? 3. They are liable to be deprived of Christ's
   presence, which was the case of the church here: she had had a glorious
   enjoyment of Christ's presence; he had been with her in his garden, and
   had made a noble entertainment for her and his friends, quickly after
   which she falls asleep; and after he had made some attempts to awake
   her, and had given some notices of his regard to her, withdraws himself
   from her, verse 6. 4. Such may be robbed of what is valuable and dear
   unto them; a man that is asleep, any thing that he has, money, jewels,
   etc. may be taken from him; so a believer, though he cannot lose his
   grace, nor that treasure which he has in heaven, yet he may lose his
   comfort and liveliness; and the truths of the gospel may be more easily
   wrung out of his hands. 5. Such a sleepy, lazy frame, tends to
   spiritual poverty; it brings leanness upon the soul: grace, as to its
   exercise, is brought low thereby, and the soul into a declining
   condition. 6. Such persons are liable to be surprised with the
   midnight-cry; though it is tree those who are real believers, shall
   never be found without oil in their lamps, but shall be always ready in
   Christ for his appearance; yet it will not be so startling and
   surprising to the waking, as to the sleepy virgins. 7. Such a frame is
   both displeasing to Christ and uncomfortable to themselves: a lukewarm
   frame Christ so resents, that he threatens to "spew such out of his
   mouth;" neither is it very comfortable to themselves; it is but broken
   sleep they have; they are disturbed with many startlings and joggings
   of conscience; like persons who know it is their duty to arise and be
   about their business, and yet have no power to do so, being overcome
   with sleep.

   Secondly, She declares, that notwithstanding she slept, yet her heart
   was awake. R. Sol. Jarchi divides these words, and refers the former
   clause, "I sleep," to the bride; and this here, "my heart waketh," to
   the bridegroom; and so he says, it is expounded ha an ancient book of
   theirs, called Pesikta [614] : and then the sense is, Though I have
   been, and am in a sleepy frame of spirit, yet he who is my heart [615]
   , my life, my soul, my all; he whom I love with all my heart, and who
   is the rock, the strength of my heart, mad my portion for ever; he, I
   say, never slumbers nor sleeps, but watches over me night and day even
   when I am asleep, that nothing hurts me. But in another ancient book of
   theirs, called Zohar [616] , I dad both clauses referred to the church,
   and so they are to be understood; "my heart waketh," that is, my
   regenerate part, which is sometimes called in scripture, "the spirit,"
   and the "inward man;" that is to say, so far as my carnal and
   unregenerate heart prevails, "I sleep;" and so far as I am renewed and
   sanctified, "my heart waketh:" she was not so fast asleep, but that, 1.
   She had some thoughts of heart concerning Christ; he was not wholly out
   of her mind; though she was asleep, her thoughts were running upon, and
   employed about her beloved; his image was so impressed upon her mind,
   that she thought him present; and every thing that stirred, supposed it
   was he, and that she heard his voice; even as lovers in their sleep,
   have their thoughts running upon the person who is the object of their
   love. 2. There were some stirrings of affections in her towards him;
   though she had got into this sleepy and lazy frame of soul, yet Christ
   was still the object of her love; and therefore she says, "it is the
   voice of my beloved;" she was not so fast asleep, but that she could
   not only know and distinguish the voice of Christ, but she could also
   call him " her beloved? 3. There were no doubt some convictions of sin
   upon her conscience: we must not suppose her to be in such a dead
   sleep, as to be "past feeling," or to have her "conscience seared with
   an hot iron;" she was sensible of her evil, in indulging such a flame;
   though, being overcome with sleep, she had no power to guard against
   it. 4. It is highly probable, that she was not without some desires
   after being in her duty, as being uneasy in her present case; it seems
   to be with her, as it was with the disciples when asleep, of whom
   Christ says, "that the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak;" they,
   with her here, had a will to duty, a will to watch and pray with him;
   "but how to perform they knew not," being overpowered with this fleshly
   and earthly part.

   Now from this whole account which she gives of herself, as sleeping,
   and yet waking, we may observe the following things. (1.) That a
   believer has two different principles in him; a principle of
   corruption, and a principle of grace; the one he brings into the world
   with him, the other is wrought by the Spirit of God; and these are
   represented as two different persons, both by the church here, who
   speaks of and that sleeps, and an heart that wakes; and by the apostle
   elsewhere, who speaks of a new man, and an old man; of himself, as
   having no good thing dwelling in him, and yet of an I that sinneth not
   (see Rom. 7:18-20; Eph. 4:22-24). (2.) That these two different
   principles may exert themselves, at one and the same time, in a
   believer; "the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against
   the flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other: the law in the
   members wars against the law in the mind, and the law in the mind
   opposes the law in the members;" and at the same time she sleeps, her
   heart wakes. (3.) That corruption may seem to have the ascendant, in a
   believer's heart for a time; it seems to have had k in the church here;
   sleep overpowered her, though her heart was awake: this law in the
   members may carry captive for some time, and have such a power over the
   believer, as that he cannot do the good which he would. (4.)
   Notwithstanding, true grace cannot be lost in a believer; it is an
   immortal seed which remains and abides; grace is always alive, though
   not always alike lively; it is "a well of living water springing up
   into everlasting life." (5.) The difference between a carnal and a
   spiritual heart; the one is in a dead sleep, the other, though asleep,
   yet his heart wakes; the one has spirit as well as flesh, the other is
   nothing but flesh. And, considering these as the words of the church,
   they inform us, 1. That believers have a discerning of their state and
   condition; when in the lowest, they know in some measure how it is with
   them, and can observe a difference in themselves, from themselves, and
   from what they have formerly been, which an unconverted person is a
   stranger to; he is not capable of making such a remark as this upon
   himself, which the church here does; though it is true, the believer
   may be left sometimes to make a wrong judgment of himself. 2. That
   believers are ingenuous in acknowledging their sins, failings ,and
   infirmities; which is an evidence of the truth of grace, and that there
   are more or less some stirrings of it, where this spirit is. 3. That it
   is the duty of believers to take notice of their grace, as well as of
   their sin; and therefore the church takes notice of her "waking heart,"
   as well as of her "sleeping I:" we should be careful how we deny or
   lessen the work of the Spirit of God upon our souls, but speak of it to
   the glory of him who is the author of it; who can, does, and will keep
   our hearts awake, grace alive there; though we, with the church, may be
   sometimes suffered to fall asleep: thus much for her state and
   condition. Now follows,

   II.Christ's carriage and behavior to her when in this state, as
   acknowledged by herself.

   1st, He called unto her, and that so loud, that she, though asleep,
   could hear, and own it to be his voice, saying, "It is the voice of my
   beloved." By the voice of Christ, we must understand the gospel, as
   preached by his ministering servants; by whom he often calls to his
   drowsy and sleepy saints to awake, as he does here. In what sense the
   gospel is the voice of Christ, and how it may be and is distinguished
   by believers from the voice of strangers, have been shown in Song of
   Solomon 2:8. I need only add here, that as it is a distinguishing
   character of believers to know Christ's voice; so they are capable of
   doing it, even when in a carnal and sleepy frame of soul: believers
   sometimes, under hearing the word, are very dull and heavy; there is
   but very little exercise of faith in them; yet: they can then
   distinguish the gospel from what is not so; though they are little
   affected with it, and receive but very little advantage by it: nay, it
   may be further observed, that she could say, it was the voice of her
   beloved; for though her faith and love were very low, yet they were not
   lost; but then let it be carefully remarked, that though she was
   capable of making such observations on what she heard, yet she was not
   thoroughly awaked hereby, but sleeps on still: thus, notwithstanding
   Christ's passionate expostulation with his disciples in the garden,
   saying, "What, could ye not watch with me one hour?" I say,
   notwithstanding this, they fall asleep again. Christ's word, without
   his power, will neither quicken dead sinners, nor awake sleepy saints;
   neither of these will be affected by it, unless he puts in the finger
   of his powerful and efficacious grace, "by the hole of the door," as he
   does in verse 4. Well, Christ calling her by his ministers, and not
   awaking her, he takes another method: and therefore,

   2dly, Knocks, and calls again, saying, Open to me, etc. There is, 1. A
   knocking at sinners hearts at first conversion. The heart of an
   unconverted sinner is bolted and barred against Christ, with the strong
   bolts and bars of sin and unbelief: elect sinners, whilst in a state of
   nature, are stout-hearted, and far from righteousness; they are
   unwilling to submit to Christ and his righteousness, nor to open the
   doors of their hearts, and let the king of glory in: he stands and
   knocks there, by the preaching of the gospel; and, having the key of
   David in his hands, "he openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth, and
   no man openeth;" with this key of almighty and efficacious grace, he
   openeth their hearts, as he did Lydia's; and, with the hammer of his
   word, breaks them in pieces, and causes all bolts and bars to fly
   before him; plucks down the strong holds which Satan had made;
   dispossesses the strong man of his armor, wherein he trusted, to keep
   his palace in peace and safety; and reduces all in obedience to
   himself; where entering with his glorious train of graces, and hawing
   dethroned sin, sets up grace to reign in his stead; and takes
   possession of the heart as his palace, from whence sin and Satan will
   never be able to eject him. Now in this mighty work of grace, in thus
   conquering and subduing a sinner's heart, we are not to suppose that
   here is a force upon the will; for though before they were unwilling,
   as well as unable to open and let him in, yet are now made willing in
   the day of his power, to submit unto him; they become voluntary
   subjects to him; and Christ meets with a kind reception and hearty
   welcome from them; so that they are as desirous of having him there, as
   he is of entering in, when this day of his power has passed upon them.
   But, 2. There is a knocking at churches, or at the hearts of particular
   believers; and of this we read in Revelation 3:20. "Behold, I stand at
   the door and knock," etc. the church of Lacodicea there appears to be
   in much the same case and condition as the church is here: the church
   here was asleep, though her heart was awake; and the church of Laodicea
   there was lukewarm, neither hot nor cold; which being highly
   displeasing to Christ, in order to bring her to a sense of her present
   condition, he comes and stands at the door, and knocks, as he does
   here. Now we are not to suppose that Christ is ever turned out of
   doors; that the key is turned upon him; or that he has not always a
   dwelling in his churches, or in the hearts of particular believers; for
   he is Christ in us, and in all believers, the hope of glory; he is
   there, and will continue there, till he has brought them to that glory
   which they are hoping for; though sometimes they are so shut up in
   their frames, that they can neither come forth themselves, in the
   enlargement of their desires and affections, and in the exercise of
   grace, nor let in Christ unto them; there is but very little communion
   between Christ and them; and though there is no distance or separation
   with respect to union, yet there is with regard to communion; there
   stands as it were a door, a wall, a middle wall of partition, between
   Christ and their souls; and oftentimes, which is still worse, they are
   secure, careless and unconcerned about it; therefore Christ, in order
   to bring them to a sense of themselves, and their present condition;
   that they may see their need of, and that desires may be stirred up in
   them, after communion with himself, comes and stands at the door, and
   knocks: which knocking I take to be, not by the ministry of the word,
   as before: but in a providential way, in a way of chastisement, by
   taking in his hand the rod of affliction or scourge of persecution, and
   lashing his children with them; with such severe raps and blows of
   persecution did he knock at the door of the church, in the times of
   Constantius, Valens and Julian, emperors of Rome, after she was fallen
   asleep, through the peace and prosperity which she enjoyed in the times
   of Constantine: the two former of which persecuted the orthodox
   ministers and others, in favor of the Arians; and the latter entirely
   apostatized from the Christian religion, and became a bitter enemy and
   cruel persecutor of it: and this is thought by some interpreters [617]
   , to be particularly intended here: and in this sense we are to
   understand knocking, in that parallel text (Rev. 3:20), as is manifest
   by comparing it with verse 19, "as many as I love, I rebuke and
   chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent; behold, I stand at the door
   and knock," etc. His knocking there, is no other than his rebukes and
   chastisements in a way of love, which were designed to bring her to a
   sense of herself, as appears from that exhortation, "be zealous
   therefore, and repent;" and that she might see her need of, and have
   her desires enlarged after communion with him, as is manifest from
   these words; "if any man open to me, I will come in to him, and will
   sup with him, and he with me;" which also is his end and design in
   knocking after this manner here; "it is the voice of my beloved that
   knocketh, saying, Open to me." There is an emphasis upon the word me!
   open to me, who am thy Lord, thy head, thy husband, and thy friend: and
   by opening to him; he means an enlarging of their affections and
   desires to him, which were now very cold and chill; and an exercise of
   their faith upon him, which was very weak; which they of themselves
   were no more capable to do, than a sinner is to open his heart to
   Christ at first conversion; this can only be done by him, who has the
   key of David, who openeth and no man shutteth, etc. and therefore we
   find this knocking was also ineffectual, until he exerted his mighty
   grace, as in verse 4, his saying to her, "open to me," is designed to
   convince her of her present condition, and what need she stood in of
   his presence and assistance.

   3dly, Christ not only calls by the ministry of the word, and knocks in
   a providential way, by his rebukes and chastisements; but he also gives
   her good words, kind and endearing titles and characters: he calls to
   her, saying, "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled."
   The three first of these titles and characters have been already
   considered and explained: the first title, my sister, is expressive of
   the near relation the church stands in to Christ, being "flesh of his
   flesh, and bone of his bone," and has been spoken to on chapter 4:9,
   the second, "my love," shews the strong affection Christ had for her,
   she being the alone object of it, and has been opened on chapter 1:9,
   the third, "my dove," declares the church's harmlessness and
   simplicity, her cleanness, purity and chastity, as has been shewn on
   chapter 2:14, and the fourth, "my undefiled, or my perfect one [618] ,
   as it is in the Hebrew text, is what we have not yet met with, and
   therefore will deserve a little more consideration. And here it must be
   observed, that all the descendants of Adam, by ordinary generation, are
   polluted and defiled, both in their nature and actions; all the parts
   of their bodies, and powers and faculties of their souls are so; their
   will and affections, understanding and judgment, mind and conscience,
   are all defiled; and indeed how can at otherwise be, for "who can bring
   a clean thing out of an unclean? not one:" nay, believers themselves
   are not free from pollution; but complain of the uncleanness of their
   hearts and lips; and frankly acknowledge that they are all as an
   unclean thing, and that all their righteousnesses are as filthy rags:
   it may then seem strange, that Christ should call his church, and that
   in her present circumstances, his undefiled one; and so she is, not in
   herself; but as considered in him, believers are full of spots in
   themselves, but having in his spotless righteousness, he looks upon
   them as all fair, and as having no spot in them; they are the undefiled
   in the way, even whilst in the way to glory: and on this side the
   heavenly inheritance, which is incorruptible, undefiled, and that
   fadeth net away, reserved in the heavens far them. Or else, this
   character may regard her chastity to Christ; who, though she was guilty
   of many failings and infirmities, yet she had kept his bed undefiled;
   had not committed spiritual adultery, which is idolatry, but kept close
   to his ways and ordinances, as those we read of in Revelation 14:4,
   who, because they did not join with the whore of Rome in her
   abominations, are said not to be "defiled with women, for they are
   virgins; these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth."
   Now Christ calls his church by all those loving and endearing titles,
   1. To shew that she stood in the same relation to him she ever did, and
   was loved by him with the same love she ever was; though sleepy and
   lazy, careless and negligent of her duty, and regardless of him, yet
   she is his sister, his love, his dove, his undefiled: notwithstanding
   all this, there was a change in the frame of her soul, and in her
   carriage and behavior towards him; but no alteration in her relation to
   him, nor in his love to her, which shews him indeed, "Jesus, the same
   yesterday, to-day, and for ever." 2. That all these knocks, raps, and
   chastisements, were all in love; he meant it for her good, and would
   have her take it so: we are too apt to think, when chastised and under
   God's afflicting hand, that it is in a way of wrath, and that he deals
   not with us as children; but when he knocks, and gives such endearing
   characters as these, it plainly shews that it is all in love. 3. To
   manifest how desirous he was of communion with her, and therefore takes
   all ways to obtain it; he calls and knocks, and calls again, and that
   in the most tender, moving language that can be. And this is not all,
   but,

   4thly, He expostulates with her, and uses very pressing instances and
   powerful arguments to persuade her to open and let him in; "for my
   head," says he, "is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the
   night:" here, because of the great love and affection which he has for
   his church, and the desire he has of enjoying communion with her; here,
   he is represented as coming in the night, season to pay her a visit,
   and standing knocking at her door, and waiting so long there for an
   answer, until his head was filled with dew, and his locks with the
   drops of the night: which may be understood, either, 1. Of the
   doctrines and blessings of grace, which Christ came full fraught with;
   these being compared to dew in scripture, see Deuteronomy 32:2, Hosea
   14:6, and then the sense is, "Behold, my love, I starts at thy door
   knocking, and waiting to be admitted in; I pray thee, rise and open to
   me, for I am come filled with the comfortable and refreshing doctrines
   of the gospel, and wire all the spiritual blessings of the everlasting
   covenant of grace, which I know are needful and proper for thee:" So R.
   Sol. Jarchi, by dew, understands God's blessings for those who turn by
   repentance; though by drops of the night, he thinks are meant
   punishments tot those who forsake and despise him. Or else, 2. These
   words may intend the sufferings of Christ, which I rather incline to:
   Thus Nebuchadnezzar's body being wet with the dew of heaven, is
   expressive of the forlorn and miserable condition he was in, when being
   driven from men, he eat grass as oxen, and was exposed to all the
   inclemency of the heavens; so when Christ's head is here said to be
   filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the night, it may mean
   his sufferings in Ins state of humiliation, who had no where to lay his
   head; whose constant practice it was some time before his death, in the
   day time, to teach in the temple, and in the night continued praying in
   the mount of Olives; and that night in which he was taken, appears to
   be a very cold one, from Peter's warming himself: so that there seems
   to be an agreement between those outward sufferings of his, and these
   represented in these words; though no doubt far greater than those
   intended here, which he underwent in his own person, on the account of
   his church; which may be compared to dew and drops of the night, (1.)
   Because of the multitude of them, the dew and drops of the night being
   many: Christ's sufferings were many and various; there are the
   sufferings of his body and of his soul, and many of both sorts; what
   tongue can express, what heart can conceive what he underwent, when he
   bore our sins and his Father's wrath? and because of the multitude of
   them, they are compared, not only to dew and drops of the night, but to
   floods (Ps. 69:1, 2). (2.) As the dew and drops of the night are
   uncomfortable and prejudicial to health, especially in those hot
   countries; so Christ's sufferings were uncomfortable to the human
   nature, as is manifest from what he said to his Father in the garden,
   and when upon the cross; and they would have been intolerable to any
   but himself. (3.) As the dew and drops of the night, though prejudicial
   to the health of persons, yet are very useful and fructifying to the
   truth; so the sufferings of Christ, though uncomfortable to the human
   nature, yet have produced many blessings of grace, and are the means of
   bringing many sons to glory (see John 12:24). Now the sum of the
   argument then is this; seeing I have suffered so much and so largely on
   this account, how canst thou be so cruel so hard-hearted, so base and
   disingenuous, as not to arise and let me in? so lovers sometimes
   represent their case in such circumstances as hardly dealt with [619] ;
   and know not which to call most hard and cruel, the door shut against
   them, or the lover within: and yet, notwithstanding such a moving and
   melting argument, what idle excuses does the church make to put Christ
   off, in the following words?

Chapter 5 Verse 3

   I have put off my coat, how shall I put it on?
   I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word sleepy and lazy frame which the church had fallen into,
   together with Christ's carriage and behavior towards her in that
   condition, has been considered in the preceding verse; and in this we
   have the effect which Christ calls and knocks, his melting language,
   and moving expostulations had upon her: all the answer he obtains from
   her, are only some idle excuses and frivolous shifts to put him off.
   Some interpreters [620] indeed have attempted to vindicate the church
   from slothfulness and rudeness, and would have this ascribed to her
   modesty, which would not admit her to appear before so great a person
   in such a disagreeable dress: but if this had been the case, he would
   never have resented her behavior to him, as he did by withdrawing from
   her; he would never have suffered her to wander about the city in quest
   of him, as she did; nor would he have permitted the watchmen to abuse
   leer, as they did, by smiting, wounding, and unveiling her; nor should
   she have gone so long, until she was sick of love, before she found
   him, had net all this been to chastise her for her former slothfulness
   and rudeness. Nor are we to consider these words as of one asking for
   information sake, how she should do this and the other thing, as Being
   willing to comply with the request made to her, if she knew but how;
   for she had no desire to do it; her chief design being to keep her bed,
   her ease and rest, if possible; therefore, though she is not so rude as
   to say, that she would not arise and let him in; yet her words and
   actions manifestly shew that she had no design to do it, and therefore
   makes the excuses she does; which are to be looked upon as an absolute
   denial, and were so interpreted by Christ; and may be paralleled with
   that answer which the man gave to his friend, who came at midnight to
   borrow loaves of him, which, in Luke 11:7, you will find to be this,
   "Trouble me not, the door is now shut, and my children are with me in
   bed; I cannot rise and give thee." Having given you this general view
   of the words, I wilt now consider the parts of them, or the particular
   excuses that she makes.

   First, She says, "I have put off my coat," and from thence argues," how
   shall I put it on?" It will be proper to consider what is meant by her
   putting off her coat; and also what the argument she forms upon it, or
   the conclusion she draws from it, intends, 1. The believer's coat is
   Christ and his righteousness: his clothing is the garments of
   salvation, and his covering the robe of righteousness; all which he has
   from Christ, who is Jehovah, our righteousness; whose righteousness is
   the saints wedding-garment; which being made of fine linen, clean and
   white, and put upon them, they are clothed as with the sun; their own
   garments, whether of sin or righteousness, are filthy ones; in the room
   of which, is given to them change of raiment. Now this coat or garment
   of justifying righteousness, being wrought out by Christ, and brought
   to the soul by the Spirit of God, faith puts on, according to Romans
   13:14. "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ," that is, the righteousness of
   Christ; which faith puts on, as a man does his clothes: and for this
   reason we are said to be justified by faith; not that faith, by virtue
   of its own, has an influence in our justification, or is a part of it;
   for we are no otherwise justified by it, than as it apprehends, lays
   hold, and puts on Christ for righteousness. Now this coat or garment
   being once put on, the believer can never be disrobed of it; it as an
   everlasting righteousness; it will never wear out, nor can it be lost,
   nor will it ever be taken away from him: Adam lost the righteousness in
   which he was created, but the believer's can never be lost; for it is
   not the righteousness of a creature, but of God; those who once have on
   Christ's righteousness, always have; for being once justified by it,
   they will always be so; nor must it he imagined, that ever a true
   believer will be left to despise and reject this righteousness: there
   is nothing dearer to him, and more valued by him than this is; he often
   thinks of it in himself, and frequently speaks of it to others; he
   desires to be always found in it, living and dying; but yet sometimes
   his faith may be remiss about it; may lie dormant, and be very little
   exercised on this glorious object: sometimes a believer is got into
   such a carnal, secure, and lazy frame of spirit, as the church here
   was, that he contents himself with the bare performance of external
   duties, without having his soul affected with, or his faith concerned
   about Christ, as the Lord his righteousness; nay, sometimes when he is
   not in such a frame, he is too apt to dwell upon his own heart, his
   graces, his frames, his duties; there is a great deal of legality
   sometimes in believers, and their practice runs contrary to their light
   and judgment. Now so far as we rest in ourselves in our duties and
   performances, or dwell in our graces and our frames; so far we may be
   said to have put off our coat, or to have laid aside and neglected the
   righteousness of Christ; tho" it is certain, believers cannot be really
   disrobed of it; and perhaps this may be the sense of these words. [621]
   Or else, 2. They may intend her leaving her first love; as her faith in
   Christ's righteousness was very low, so her love to Christ, his people,
   ways and ordinances, was very cold; there is such a thing as leaving,
   though not losing our first love, for which the church at Ephesus was
   blamed (Rev. 2:4), now when saints are in the exercise of this grace of
   love to Christ or his people, they may be said to put it on, as the
   apostle exhorts, in Colossians 3:14. "And above all these things, put
   on charity, or love, which is the bond of perfectness," and when they
   grow remiss and cold in it, they may be said to put it off. 3. These
   words may also represent her neglect of her duty; for she had not only
   dropped in a great measure the exercise of grace, but likewise the
   performance of duty; she was grown slothful and inactive; she had put
   off her clothes, as having done working, and therefore takes to her
   bed, and composes herself to rest: thus, as a performance of duties may
   be called a putting of them on; see Colossians 3:12, so a neglect of
   them may be called a putting of them off; which Eliphaz, in Job 15:4.
   calls a casting off fear before God; for he intends thereby a disregard
   to religious exercises, which he supposed Job chargeable with. 4. These
   words manifestly shew, that she was in a sleepy, drowsy frame; had put
   off her clothes, and was gone to bed; that she was now off her guard,
   and had dropped her spiritual watchfulness: thus, as putting and
   keeping on of clothes is a sign of watchfulness (see Neh. 4:23; Rev.
   16:15); so putting them off is an indication of the contrary; and she
   having done so, is not only exposed to danger, but to shame, disgrace,
   and scandal. 5. Being now free from troubles, afflictions and
   persecutions, she puts off her coat, and betakes herself to a bed of
   cage; and though Christ calls, yet she is unwilling to arise and go
   along with him, lest she should meet with the same trials and
   sufferings as before, for the sake of him and his gospel; so much does
   the love of worldly ease prevail over God's own children, that they are
   sometimes loath to arise and follow Christ in his own ways.

   Now from hence she argues, and thus she concludes, that seeing she had
   put off her coat, how should she put it on? Which discovers, (1.) That
   she was apprehensive of difficulty in doing it, "How shall I etc. that
   is, how difficult will it be for me to do it?" and indeed it is easier
   dropping, the exercise of a grace, or the performance of a duty, than
   it is to take it up again after we have so done; and when grace is
   called to exert itself, or a duty is presented to be performed, carnal
   reason raises a thousand difficulties as insuperable, which faith only
   gets over. (2.) This way of arguing shews her sluggishness, and her
   love of ease; a sluggard thinks there is danger if he arises and goes
   into the streets, saying, "There is a lion without, I shall be slain in
   the streets;" and he is so wretchedly slothful, that having "hid his
   hand in his bosom, it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth:" so
   she, having put off her coat, was so exceeding slothful and sluggish,
   that she was loath, it grieved her, it went to her very heart, she did
   not know how to bring herself to it, to put it on again. (3). Nay there
   was not only a loathness, but an aversion to it; the carnal and fleshly
   part in the believer is entirely averse, either to the exercise of
   grace, or to the discharge of duty; it lusteth against the spirit;
   though there is a willingness in the regenerate part thereunto, for he
   delights in the law of God, after the inward man: but the former seems
   to have the ascendant in the church here, which makes her say, "How
   shall I, etc." I am averse unto it. (4.) It intimates as though she
   thought it unreasonable in him to desire it, seeing her clothes were
   off, and she was now in bed; for him to desire her to arise and open,
   and let him in, was, what she thought, an unreasonable request, and
   therefore says, "How shall I put it on?" that is, How canst thou desire
   it of me? though this which Christ called her to, and indeed, had it
   been much more difficult than it was, but her reasonable service. (5.)
   It supposes that she was apprehensive of danger by doing it; that it
   would be incommodious and detrimental to her, break her rest, disturb
   her ease, and be prejudicial to her health; there being danger of it,
   as she imagined, by rising out of her bed, and putting on her clothes
   to let him in. Now arguments taken from, and formed upon such selfish
   principles, are much made use of by carnal reason, and are pleaded with
   a great deal of force and vehemence by it, against the observance of an
   ordinance or performance of a duty: it was upon this foot that those
   who were bidden to the wedding, excused themselves; it was against
   their worldly profit and pleasure to comply with the invitation; one
   had bought a piece of ground, another, five yoke of oxen, and a third
   had married a wife, and therefore they could not come; and in so doing,
   declared that they valued their worldly interest before the blessings
   of grace in Christ; as the church here in saying, "How shall I put it
   on?" shews, that she preferred her worldly ease to Christ's company,
   and that she sought more her "own things, than the things which are
   Jesus Christ's." (6.) It may also signify that she knew not how to do
   it, because of that shame and confusion which attended her on the
   account of her sins and transgressions against him; being conscious to
   herself of these things she blushed and was ashamed, not knowing how to
   shew her face, and appear before him with any confidence, and therefore
   puts him off with these excuses; and so it oftentimes with believers,
   who, when they have fallen into sin neglect their duty through shame,
   and so add sin to sin, as the. church did here: and this sense the
   Targum gives of this part of the words after this manner: "The
   congregation of Israel answered and said before the prophets, Lo, now I
   have removed from me the yoke of his precepts, and have served the
   idols of the people; and how can I have the face to return unto him?"
   though it makes the latter part of the text to be, not the words of the
   church, but of the Lord; who makes answer to her, and lets her know,
   that as he had removed his divine presence from her, because of her
   sins, how should he return to her again? Which other part of the words
   come now to be considered.

   Secondly, She urges that she had washed her feet; and therefore how
   could she "defile them." Washing of feet was a custom much used in the
   eastern countries, where they wore not shoes, but sandals, and
   therefore contracted a great deal of soil, especially in travelling,
   after which it was usual to wash them; which not only removed the filth
   from them, but much comforted and refreshed them: instances of this we
   have in Abraham and Lot, who desired that water might be brought to
   wash the feet of the angels, whom they thought to be men, also in
   Abraham's servant, in Joseph's brethren, and in Christ's washing the
   feet of his disciples a little before his death: washing of feet was
   also used before going to bed [622] , which is what is here referred
   to. Now this is to be understood, not of the washing of regeneration,
   with which no doubt she was washed, being Christ's spouse and bride, as
   well as washed in his blood; for that is the work of the spirit of God,
   in his mighty operations of his grace upon her; but this appears to be
   something of her own doing, "I have washed my feet, etc." nor is it
   meant of the purity of her outward conversation; though feet and
   walking, when applied to the saints, do in a spiritual sense, intend
   this oftentimes, but it does not intend it here; for her outward
   conversation does not appear to be so clean and pure, and so becoming
   the gospel, and her profession of it, as it should be. But, 1. It may
   be observed, that she had plucked off her shoes or sandals, which are
   the gospel, and a conversation agreeable to it, according to Ephesians
   6:15. "And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace."
   Now when the believer's feet are shod thus, that is, when he holds "the
   mystery of the faith in a pure conscience," then may it be said of him,
   as in chapter 7:1. "How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O princes
   daughter!" but now the church here had plucked off hers, in order to
   wash her feet; that is, she was grown very careless about the doctrines
   of the gospel, and very negligent in keeping up a conversation
   answerable to them. 2. This phrase shows that she was grown weary of
   spiritual exercises, so persons when they are weary of work or
   travelling, used to wash their feet, and go to rest. She was grown
   weary of well-doing, and was much like those in Malachi 1:13, who said,
   in regard to the performance of religious exercises, "Behold, what a
   weariness is it!" and therefore washes her feet, lays aside an
   observance of ordinances and duties, and betakes herself to her carnal
   ease and rest; and being called from thence, she argues, "I have washed
   my feet, how shall I defile them;" which intimates as before, a
   loathness, an aversion to it; and as though she thought it unreasonable
   in him to desire it, and criminal in her to comply with it. Where
   observe her wretched mistake, in imagining that hearkening to, and
   obeying Christ's commands, would be a defiling her; and it also shews
   us what poor, little trifling excuses, persons in such a condition will
   make, to keep themselves in their carnal ease and peace, in a state of
   slothfulness and inactivity; nay, these excuses of hers were not only
   idle and frivolous, as the putting on of her coat, and defiling her
   feet, but likewise vile and sinful, as will appear from the following
   considerations. (1.) She had slighted the means which Christ had made
   use of to awake her; she had made them null and void, and of no effect;
   he had called to her by the ministry of the word, and had knocked in a
   providential way, and yet to no purpose; she withstands both his knocks
   and calls, which must needs be an aggravation of her sin. (2.) She
   sinned against light and knowledge; she knew that it was the voice of
   her beloved that called unto her, and acknowledges it to be so; and yet
   she sleeps on, and makes these idle excuses as she does, which must
   needs increase her guilt. (3.) She had invited him to come but a little
   before, as in chapter 4:16. "Let my beloved come into his garden;"
   accordingly he did come; and as soon as he was come, she falls asleep,
   and treats him after this base and disingenuous manner. (4.) She had
   purposely composed herself to sleep; it does not seem to have fallen
   upon her at an unawares; but she as it were sought it, and for this
   reason put off her coat, and washed her feet, that she might be the
   more fit for rest, and take it more easily. (5.) Yet she endeavors to
   shift the blame from off herself, as if she was no ways in the fault,
   but that the thing was either difficult and unreasonable, or else
   unlawful to be done; and therefore she says, "How shall I, etc." (6.)
   She appears in all this to be guilty of the greatest ingratitude; she
   fell into this sleepy and lazy frame after this and a noble
   entertainment and sumptuous feast that Christ had made for her; she
   continues herein, notwithstanding the most affectionate characters he
   gives her, and the most powerful arguments he uses with her; she sleeps
   on, though he lets her know that his "head was filled with dew, and his
   locks with the drops of the night:" though he had suffered and
   undergone so much on her account, yet, O vile ingratitude! she is
   unwilling to be at the trouble of putting on a coat on his account, or
   to run the risk of defiling her feet for his sake. (7.) She also
   discovers the highest folly, in that she prefers her present ease to
   Christ's company. Well, but how does Christ take this? How can he bear
   to be affronted after this rate? Does he not highly resent it? Yes; but
   this will farther appear in the consideration of the following verses.

Chapter 5 Verse 4

   My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door,
   and my bowels were moved for him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church proceeds here to give an account of some farther
   steps which Christ took in order to awake her, and cause her to arise
   and open to him; which, though they are instants of his grace unto her,
   yet manifestly shew how much he resented her unkindness and ingratitude
   to him! and she also takes notice what influence this carriage of his
   towards her had upon her. In these words we have,

   I.The method which Christ took in order to have entrance; he "put in
   his hand by the hole of the door."

   II.The effect it had upon her; her "bowels were moved for him."

   I.The method which Christ took to let himself in. Seeing she was so
   loath and so unwilling to arise and open to him, he attempts it
   himself; not by breaking open the door, but by putting in his hand by
   the hole thereof, in order to remove the bolt or bar which kept him
   from entering in. Some read the words, "My beloved put down his hand
   from the hole of the door, or lock;" [623] that is, withdrew or removed
   his hand from thence: he put it in there for the aforesaid reason; but
   hearing such language from within, as in the preceding verse, "I have
   put off my coat," etc. he desisted from his attempt, and went his way;
   resolving to chastise her for her base usage of him, by a departure
   from her; which, when she understood, it threw her into that concern of
   mind, which appears in this verse; and also put her upon taking those
   methods to find him, which the following verses shew she did. But I
   shall consider the words according to our version or them, "My beloved
   put in his hand by the hole of the door;" and then, not to take any
   notice of the character which she gives him, "My beloved," which has
   been often considered and explained; I shall inquire, 1st, What is
   meant by the door. 2dly, What by the hole of the door. 3dly, What the
   hand of Christ signifies. 4thly, What the putting of it in is
   expressive of.

   1st, It will be proper to inquire what is meant by the door. There are
   several things in scripture which bear this name, in a figurative and
   metaphorical sense; as Christ, the church, an occasion or opportunity
   of preaching the gospel, John 10:9-Song of Solomon 8:9, 1 Corinthians
   16:9, etc. none of which can be intended here. A Jewish writer [624]
   thinks, that the firmament is here meant, and that God put forth his
   hand from thence; perhaps either in a threatening way, or by inflicting
   some chastisement on the people of Israel, for their slothfulness and
   neglect of building the second temple: but by the door here, I
   apprehend we are to understand, either the door of faith, of which we
   read in Acts 14:27. "And when they were come," that is, "Paul and
   Barnabas, to Antioch, and had gathered the church together, they
   rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the
   doer of faith unto the Gentiles;" which must be understood, either of
   the preaching of the doctrine of faith among them, or of the
   implantation of faith in them, and perhaps both are intended: all by
   nature, whether elect or non-elect, are shut and locked up fast in the
   prison of unbelief; and when God comes to convert a sinner, he opens
   the door of faith, and sets them at liberty; though. sometimes this
   door of faith, even afterwards, is so closely shut up, as that there is
   only a little crevice, a small hole, through which a little love breaks
   forth from the soul to Christ, and a little light breaks in from Christ
   unto the soul; which seems to be the case of the church here, and is
   what Heman the Ezrahite complains of, in Psalm 88:8, when he says, "I
   am shut up, and I cannot come forth." Or else, by the door, may be
   meant the door of her heart, which was in a great measure shut against
   Christ, through weakness, and the prevailings of corruptions in her:
   thus Lydia's heart is compared to a door, which was opened by the hand
   of powerful and efficacious grace; by the means of which, Christ, with
   his large train of grace, were let in, of whom it is said (Ps.
   24:7-10), "Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye
   everlasting doors;" which are not to be understood of the doors and
   gates of the temple, though perhaps there may be an allusion to them,
   but of souls which are of an everlasting make; and the king of glory
   shall come in: Who is this king of glory? the Lord of hosts, he is the
   king of glory; even the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the King of kings,
   and Lord of lords; who is glorious in his person, in his offices, and
   in his saints; and who demands an entrance into, takes possession of,
   and dwells by faith in the hearts of his people. The door then is
   either the door of faith, or the door of her heart; or if we put them
   both together, and say, it is faith in her heart here meant, I cannot
   see that it will be amiss, But,

   2dly, What is meant by the hole of the door, is our next enquiry. The
   word door is not in the Hebrew text; therefore some interpret it the
   hole of the window or casement, others of the lock; but it seems rather
   to be of the door: this hole was either in the door, or hard by it, so
   R. Solomon Jarchi thinks; or else was between the two leaves or
   foldings of the door, according to R. Aben Ezra; but however, it is the
   mystical and spiritual sense which we are chiefly concerned about. And
   having interpreted the door, of her heart, or of faith in her heart;
   and there being but a small hole in this door, through which Christ put
   his hand, it lets us know that her heart was much narrowed and
   straitened; her faith was very low in its exercise on Christ, which
   sometimes is an open door to receive him; but now was but as an hole,
   through which but little light was let in from Christ, and but little
   love returned to him; her affections were chilly and cold, which used
   to be enlarged with fervency unto him; her obedience to him was but
   very small, not attended with that cheerfulness and spirit of liberty,
   as heretofore; which seems to be the case of David, when he says (Ps.
   119:32), "I will run the ways of thy commandments, when thou shalt
   enlarge nay heart;" his heart was then narrowed, and he was shut up in
   his own soul; there were not that cheerfulness and liberty, that warmth
   and zeal, that liveliness and sprightliness, which he had sometimes
   experienced, in his obedience to the divine commands: and this no doubt
   was the church's case here; but there being a hole open, though perhaps
   but a small one, yet it shows, that her heart was not entirely closed
   and shut up; it cannot be said of her, that there were in her no faith
   in Christ, no love to him, no fear of him; for grace, once implanted,
   can never be lost; though it is not always in exercise, an motion, yet
   it is always in being: and herein lies the difference between a
   regenerate and an unregenerate man; the one has his heart entirely
   closed and shut up against Christ; there is not a crevice, a cranny
   open to Christ; but the other, though his heart may be much closed and
   shut up, yet there is always an entrance, though sometimes but a small
   one, for him: but you will say, Why then does Christ say, in verse 2,
   "Open to me, my sister, my love?" etc. I answer, Because he found the
   entrance into her heart was not so wide, so open and so free, as it had
   heretofore been; and though he knew she was no more able to widen and
   enlarge her heart, and open it to him, than she was at first
   conversion; yet, to bring her under a conviction of her present state,
   he thus calls to her: no, this work is his alone; he alone can enlarge
   the heart, and make it wide enough for himself to enter in at; he has a
   key that can open this door, when he pleases, even the key of David,
   with which he openeth, and no man shutteth, and shutteth, and no man
   openeth, But I proceed,

   3dly, To shew what is meant by the hand of Christ, which he puts in by
   the hole of this door: and this I take to be his mighty, powerful, and
   efficacious grace; and so the word is used in Acts 11:21. "And the hand
   of the Lord was with them; and a great number believed, and turned to
   the Lord." The reason why the ministry of the apostles was so much
   owned for the conversion of souls, was, because it was attended with
   the mighty and efficacious grace of Christ; it was the want of this
   Isaiah complained of, when he said (Isa. 53:1), "Who hath believed our
   report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?" If the ministry
   of any is made useful for the good of souls, it is because this arm is
   revealed, and this hand is put forth; and the ministers of Christ are
   willing to ascribe it to that, and not to themselves; and can freely
   join with the apostle Paul, in saying, "Not I, but the grace of God
   which was with me;" and without this hand, all the means of orate are
   ineffectual; but this can turn the key and open the door of any heart,
   though never so closely shut, and strongly barred and bolted against
   Christ: now the same mighty and efficacious grace is equally exerted
   and put forth in the awaking of a drowsy same, reclaiming a backsliding
   professor, and quickening him to his duty, as in the conversion of a
   sinner, dead in trespasses and sins. Which brings me to consider,

   4thly, What is meant by Christ's putting in his hand of mighty and
   efficacious grace, by the hole of the door. Now this intends the
   exertion and application of grace to the hearts of believers, which
   influence and quicken, support and maintain grace in them; this is an
   internal work, and differs from all the other methods which Christ took
   with her, and appears To be more powerful than any of them; he had
   called in the external ministry of the word, and knocked in a
   providential war, by inflicting some chastisement upon her; he had
   given her good words, expostulated with her, and used persuasive
   arguments, and yet to no purpose: but now he puts in his hand of mighty
   grace, and the work is done; which hand moves secretly and invisibly,
   and yet powerfully and irresistibly; for "none can stay his hand, or
   say unto him, What doest thou?" though it uses no force or compulsion,
   but works sweetly and kindly upon the heart; for how unwilling and doth
   soever the church was before to arise and open to Christ, now she is
   entirely willing to do it; and that not through force or feat", but out
   of a real affection for him, and love to him. Christ now, in putting in
   his hand, and thus powerfully and sweetly working upon her heart,
   shows, 1. The exceeding greatness of his love and grace unto her: that
   though she had treated him in so rude a manner, and discovered so much
   disingenuity and ingratitude to him, which made him take up a
   resolution to depart from her; yet he would not leave her without
   giving some evidences of his love to her, without putting in his hand,
   and leaving some myrrh upon the lock, and sweet-smelling myrrh on the
   handles thereof. 2. His faithfulness to her: Christ never wholly and
   entirely leaves his people; he has promised that he will not, and he is
   faithful to this promise; Christ may so withdraw himself from them, as
   that they may not have sensible communion with him; but their union to
   him remains firm and indissoluble; they may think that he has totally
   and finally left them, when he has not, nor never will: he departs here
   from the church, but it was not a total departure; for he put in his
   hand by the hole of the door, and left something there, which stirred
   up her affections to him, and put her upon a diligent search and
   inquiry after him. 3. His power: What is it that the hand of Christ
   cannot do? what the external calls of the ministry, the knocks and raps
   of persecution, what good words and moving arguments could not de, that
   is done in a moment by Christ's putting in his hand; she lay still
   before, and put him off with idle excuses, but now she arises and opens
   to him. Which leads me to consider,

   II.The effect of this, or what influence this had upon her heart; her
   bowels, she says, were moved for him: which is expressive, either,

   First, Of that sorrow and grief which then possessed her heart. The
   word is used in Jeremiah 4:19, Lamentations 1:20, to express grief and
   sorrow; and indeed, it is no wonder that it should be so with her, when
   she began to be capable of revolving things in her mind, and comparing
   her carriage and his together; observing the baseness and disingenuity
   there were in the one, and the exceeding greatness of love and
   tenderness in the other. The words have a double reading in the Hebrew
   text: some copies read, "my bowels were moved ylx in me, or for me;"
   and this reading the jewish commentators follow, particularly R.
   Solomon Jarchi, and so do Junius rand Tremellius, the Tigurine version,
   and that of Pagnine's: other copies read, "my bowels were moved wilx
   for him;" which, by Mercer, is esteemed the best and most correct
   reading, and is followed by our and other translators. If we read the
   words in the first way, they will afford us these two observations: 1.
   That her grief and sorrow was inward, and so real and sincere; her
   bowels moved within her; and such a sorrow as this is what is required,
   regarded and approved of by God; "Thou desirest truth in the inward
   parts, and in the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom," says
   David (Ps. 51:6), for it is not a shedding of tears, nor rending of
   garments, but a heart broken under a sense of sin, and melted down with
   the discoveries of boundless love, that is an acceptable sacrifice with
   God through Christ. 2. That her own sin and unkindness to Christ was
   the cause of all this; my bowels were moved for me, or concerning
   myself: for what I had done, and had been guilty of, I have none to
   blame but myself; I am the sole author of all this trouble to myself;
   my own sin and wickedness has brought all this upon me; O! it pains me,
   it cuts me to the very heart, to think that I should use the best of
   husbands so unkindly, and treat him after so base a rate as I have
   done!

   But then if we follow the second reading, it will lead us to make the
   remarks following: (1.) That sin, as committed against Christ, was the
   chief and principle cause of her trouble and sorrow; "my bowels were
   moved for him," because I had sinned against him; had it been another,
   it would not have grieved me so much; but against thee, thee only have
   I sinned; which shows her repentance to be right, and her sorrow to be
   true and genuine. (2.) That the sufferings of Christ, occasioned by her
   sins and transgressions, influenced her sorrow; my bowels were moved
   for him; it grieves me, I am pained at the very heart, to think that my
   beloved's head should be wet with dew, and his locks with the drops of
   the night, through me; that he should suffer so much upon my account,
   and for my sake: now when repentance springs from faith's viewing a
   crucified and suffering Christ, it appears to be evangelical (see Zech.
   12:10). (3.) That her frustrating the means which Christ made use of,
   added to her grief: Did my beloved call and knock, and call again? and
   did I know that it was the voice of my beloved? Did he give me good
   words, expostulate and argue with me in the most moving and tender
   manner? and yet, vile and ungrateful wretch that I am, did I lie still,
   and not move to open and let him in? could he get nothing from me but
   mere shifts and evasions? O! how does the consideration of all this
   overwhelm me with grief and sorrow? (4.) That the loss of his company
   was also an ingredient herein; for, as Christ's company and presence
   fill the believer with the greatest joy, so his absence and departure
   from him give him the greatest uneasiness: "Thou didst hide thy face,"
   says David (Ps. 30:7), and I was troubled; so here, her bowels moved,
   her soul was grieved, not only for what she had done unto him; but also
   for the loss of him. Or else, these words, "my bowels were moved for
   him," are expressive,

   Secondly, Of the moving and stirring of her affections to him, in which
   sense the word is used in Isaiah 63:15, Philemon 12, for though her
   affections had been chill, and her love to Christ cold, yet they were
   not lost; Christ's putting in his hand, stirred up the coals of love,
   which "many waters cannot quench;" so that they began to kindle and
   appear in flames: for not only the grace was in her heart, but in
   exercise, in motion there, "my bowels moved," etc. so that she could
   say, after all her sleepiness, slothfulness, negligence in duty, and
   base carriage towards Christ, as Peter, after his backslidings, "Lord,
   thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee :" this love of
   hers was real, hearty and sincere; it was not the moving of her lips or
   tongue, but of her bowels within her; she loved "not in word, neither
   in tongue, but in deed and truth;" and this her actions testify, which
   are recorded in the following verses.

Chapter 5 Verse 5

   I rose up to open to my beloved, and my hands dropped with
   myrrh, and my fingers with sweet, smelling, myrrh, upon the
   handles of the lock.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words the church gives an account of a second and a
   third effect of Christ's "putting in his hand by the hole of the door."

   I.She "rose to open to him".

   II.Having done so, she laid hold on the "handles of the lock," in order
   to draw it back; and before she proceeds to take notice of any other
   steps she took, with the success thereof, she stops to give an account
   of a sweet piece of experience she met with, when she put her hands
   "upon the handles of the lock; My hands, says she, dropped with myrrh,
   and my fingers with sweet-swelling myrrh."

   I.She says, that she "rose to open to her beloved." This is opposed to
   her former slothfulness and sleepiness; before she lay still and slept
   on, notwithstanding Christ's calls and knocks, his melting words and
   moving language; but now being touched by his hand of mighty and
   powerful grace, she shakes off her sluggishness, and arises to open to
   him, which is more than a mere resolution to do it; such an one as she
   made in chapter 3:2, and the prodigal in Luke 15:18. Now these
   resolutions were made in the strength of grace; and being assisted by
   divine grace to perform them, were quickly put in execution; though
   otherwise, resolutions made in our own strength, are seldom or never
   made good: but this was more than a mere resolution, it was an actual
   performance of it; not but that she resolved no doubt in her mind, to
   do it before she did it; but the dispatch was so quick, and there being
   so little time between the making and the execution of it, she had
   neither leisure nor room to regard it; "I rose to open to my beloved;"
   which act of hers shows, 1. That her design and intention to open to
   Christ, was real and hearty: had she lain upon her bed, and made ever
   such fair promises, that she would arise and open to him, and yet have
   kept her bed and slept on; there would have been but very little proof
   that she really and heartily designed it; but her rising in order to
   it, is a full indication of it; even as Abraham's rising up early,
   saddling his asses taking his own and only son Isaac with him, and
   going to the place which the Lord directed him to; his putting the wood
   in order, binding his son, and laying him upon it; his taking the
   knife, and stretching out his hand to slay his son, manifestly showed
   that he really intended to obey the divine command, though so
   disagreeable to flesh and blood. 2. That her concern at her base and
   unbecoming carriage to him was sincere and unfeigned; the effects show
   that her sorrow was of a godly sort; seeing it wrought in her
   carefulness to obey his will, zeal for his honor and glory, fear and
   reverence of his person, a vehement desire after the enjoyment of his
   presence and company, and an indignation at her own sin and folly; see
   2 Corinthians 7:10,11. The repentance appears to be true and genuine,
   because it brought forth "fruits meet for it." 3. That she did not stay
   to confer with flesh and blood, but immediately arose, as soon as
   touched by the hand of mighty grace; had she done so, she would have
   argued thus with herself, "yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a
   little folding of the hands to sleep," and then I will arise and open
   to him; no, for though she put him off before with idle excuses, having
   consulted her own carnal ease; yet now, being under the influence of
   powerful grace, she cannot defer it any longer, but without delay, uses
   to open to him. 4. That when a soul, in such a case as hers, is made
   sensible of it, it cannot rest easy upon a bed of carnal security; it
   may, with David, for a time be senseless, stupid, and unconcerned; and
   with Jonah, lie fast asleep in the sides of the ship, careless,
   thoughtless, and unconcerned; yet when awaked from hence, anguish and
   distress seize it; and it cannot be easy without some returning visits
   of love, some views of Christ's person, and some enjoy, merit of his
   presence; and therefore will arise and go out in quest of him: and now
   no difficulties discourage such a soul, as none did the church; when,
   she was upon her bed of ease, every little thing was difficult to her;
   her language was that of the sluggard's, "There is a lion in the way, a
   lion is in the streets;" it was then a trouble to her to put on her
   coat, and an intolerable hardship to defile her feet; but now neither
   the one nor the other hinder her; but she rises, opens, and ventures
   herself alone in the streets, runs among the watchmen of the city, and
   keepers of the walls. And from thence to the daughters of Jerusalem, to
   inquire of her beloved. 5. It also supposes that she thought Christ
   still at the door; though no sooner had he put in his hand, but he was
   gone, being willing to let her know, though he loved her, yet he
   resented her carriage to him, and here we may observe, that God's
   children may he mistaken sometimes about the presence of Christ;
   sometimes he is present with them and they know it not, as, Jacob said,
   Genesis 28:16, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not;"
   and at other times, when they are got into such careless, secure, and
   unconcerned frames of soul, like Samson, the Lord is departed from
   them, and they wist not, that is, know not that the Lord is departed
   from them. 6. This shows the power of mighty and efficacious grace, and
   that she was under the influence of it; though perhaps the spirit was
   willing before, yet the flesh was weak; though she might have a will to
   open to Christ, yet how to perform it she knew not; though indeed her
   will seemed to be very indifferent about it; there appeared a lothness
   in her, and a kind of unwillingness to it; but now she is made both
   able and "willing in the day of his power," to arise and open to him.

   II.Having rose to open to Christ, she puts her hand "upon the handles
   of the lock," to draw it back, and let him in; which, in order, is the
   third effect of Christ's "putting in his hand by the hole of the door."
   Now though this is not in so many words expressed in the text, yet it
   is manifestly implied; for if her "hands dropped with myrrh, and her
   fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles of the lock;" it
   then supposes, that her hands and fingers must first lay hold upon the
   lock-handles, which was also absolutely necessary to do, in order to
   open the door. It will be proper here to consider, 1st, What we are to
   understand by the lock, and the handles of it. 2dly, What by her hands
   and fingers, which laid hold on these handles to draw back the lock,
   and in what sense they might do it.

   1st, It is needful to inquire what may be meant by the lock, and the
   handles of it: and as by the door, I suppose is meant the heart of a
   believer, so by the lock, which fastens and keeps this door shut, may
   be meant unbelief; by which, as all by nature are locked and shut up in
   the state they are; so believers sometimes by it are so straitened,
   confined, and shut up in their souls, that they cannot come forth in
   the free exercise of faith, in which they are at other times found: and
   the handles of this lock may be lukewarmness and indifference of soul
   with regard to duty, a sluggishness and loathness to come to it, which
   oftentimes bring the soul at last to a neglect of it; for, first,
   persons grow indifferent about the performance of duties, or attendance
   on ordinances; do not care whether they perform them, or attend on
   them, or no; then they begin to be "slothful in business, not serving
   the Lord" with that fervency of Spirit which they have heretofore done;
   and at last wholly neglect them; which brings them into a carnal,
   secure and unconcerned frame of spirit; and all this strengthens
   unbelief, and keeps the door the closer shut against Christ; which
   seems to have been the case of the church here, and of that of
   Laodicea, in Revelation 3, when Christ stood at her door and knocked.

   2dly, By her hands and fingers may be meant her faith in its exercise
   and operation, attended with the fruits thereof. Faith is usually
   represented in scripture as the hand of the soul by which it receives
   Christ, as the Father's free gift; embraces him as the only Savior;
   lays hold upon and retains him, as he stands in all the endearing
   characters and relations which he appears in to his own people, Now
   this faith is not idle and inactive, but "works by love" to Christ and
   his people, to his ways and ordinances; it has its fruits, and is
   attended with the performance of good works,, and will put the person
   that is possessed of it, on the discharge of his duty; it put the
   church here upon attempting to draw back the lock of unbelief; faith
   laid its hands and fingers upon the handles of it, and used all its
   might, power and diligence to do it: but it may be asked, How could the
   church be able, with all her faith, industry and diligence, to draw
   back this lock? I answer, Faith cannot do this of itself; unbelief is a
   "sin which easily besets us," but it is not so easily got rid of; it is
   a weight, that the hand of faith of itself, cannot lift and lay aside;
   the believer must say, even in the exercise of faith, with the poor man
   in the gospel, Mark 9:24. "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief;"
   this lock. grows too hard for faith to draw it back of itself; but yet
   faith's looking to, and dealing with Christ's person, blood, and
   righteousness, much weakens unbelief. When an unbelieving Thomas was
   indulged with a sight of Christ's pierced hands and feet, and was
   enabled to thrust his hand into his side; his unbelief immediately
   vanished and disappeared, and he could say, "My Lord, and my God:" it
   is certain, that the stronger faith grows, lukewarmness, indolence, and
   carnal security decay; and the soul is quickened, stirred up, and put
   upon the performance of duty: and what is it that a soul is not
   enabled, to do in the exercise of faith? difficulties which are
   insuperable to carnal sense and reason, are got over by faith; read
   ever the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews, and you will
   see what heroic acts have been performed by faith though the strength
   in which these things have been performed, did not arise from the grace
   itself, but from Christ, the object of it, whose "strength is made in
   faith's weakness;" for without him we can do nothing, but his "grace is
   sufficient to enable us to do all things."

   Now before she proceeds to tell how she succeeded in this attempt: she
   gives an account of a piece of sweet experience she met with, whilst
   she was trying to draw back the lock; "my hands," says she, "dropped
   with myrrh, and my fingers, with sweet-smelling myrrh upon the handles
   of the lock." By myrrh, is meant grace, in its aboundings and
   overflowings: but it may be inquired, From whence this myrrh came, and
   by whom it was brought? If we understand it of the church's myrrh or
   grace, as brought here by herself, as some think [625] ; who may be
   represented as taking up a pot of myrrh, intending with it to anoint
   end refresh his head which was wet with dew; which she either unawares
   or else designedly broke; or else, being :in a panic fear, her hand
   shook, and the myrrh ran over her hands and fingers; or rather, not
   having time to perfume her garments with it, as was usual (see Ps.
   45:8); she dipped her fingers in a pot of myrrh, to ingratiate and
   render herself acceptable to her beloved; supposing that he might be
   full of resentment on the account of her carriage and behavior towards
   him: and then taking it in this sense, it will teach us these things
   following; 1. That her grace was now in exercise, it was flowing; this
   oil of myrrh before was as it were congealed; but now it is become
   liquid; it is upon the flow, and flows in such abundance, that it ran
   off her hands and lingers upon the handles of the lock. 2. Her hands
   and fingers, dropping with it, show that these actions and good works
   of hers, intended by her hands and fingers, being performed in faith,
   were odorous and grateful to Christ: so the prayers of the saints are
   called odors, in Revelation 5:8, and some mean and small services of
   the Philippians, are called an odor of a sweet smell (Phil. 4:18). 3.
   That When grace is in exercise, duty is both easy and pleasant:
   Christ's commands then are not grievous, but his "ways are ways of
   pleasantness, and his paths, paths of peace:" before, nothing more
   unpleasant than to arise and open to him; but now, nothing more easy
   and delightful; her "hands drop with myrrh;" etc. But I rather think,
   that the myrrh or grace of Christ is here meant, which was brought and
   left here by him; when he "put in his hand by the hole of the door," he
   then put in this myrrh he had gathered, verse 1, and left it in the
   lock-hole; which she found in such abundance when she came to open,
   that her hands and fingers dropped with it: the allusion seems to be to
   lovers shut out, who used to cover the threshold of the door with
   flowers, and anoint the door-posts with sweet-smelling ointment. [626]
   Taking the words in this sense, we may observe that grace is called so,
   (1.) For the preciousness of it; myrrh is a precious spice, and one of
   the principal spices; and this in the text is the best of myrrh, there
   was a sort of myrrh called odoraria, sweet-smelling [627] : the word
   translated sweet-smelling myrrh," signifies "passing or current myrrh;"
   [628] it being vendible or saleable, not in the least damaged, but what
   will pass; and so is in the same sense current, as money is said to be
   (Gen. 23:16), or else, it is called "passing myrrh," because it
   diffuses its odor on every side; so R. Solomon Jarchi thinks: or,
   rather because it is that myrrh which bleeds or weeps, or drops from
   the tree of itself, which is always esteemed the best myrrh: and this
   sets forth the exceeding preciousness of Christ's grace, which is more
   valuable than all things else. (2.) It sets forth the abundance of it:
   if there was such an abundance of it brought by Christ, and left in the
   lock-hole, so that it ran in such plenty over her hands and fingers, as
   to drop from thence; What an abundance? what an overflow of it must
   there be in himself, who is "full of grace and truth?" if there is a
   super-abounding of grace in those in whom sin has abounded; What an
   overflowing fullness of it must there be in him, in whom is no sin, and
   who is the fountain from whence all grace flows, and is communicated to
   his people? (3.) It is expressive of the odorousness of it: there is
   such a sweet savor in the grace of Christ, as it is in himself, that
   the love of the virgins is drawn forth to him by it; and it emits so
   fragrant an odor, as it is in believers, that Christ himself is
   delighted with it (see Song 1:3, 4:10).

   Moreover, seeing it appears that this myrrh was brought unto, and left
   in the lock-hole by Christ; it may be asked, for what purpose it was
   brought and left there? which was, (1.) To draw and allure her heart
   unto him: the same grace that draws a soul to Christ at first
   conversion, draws it to him when it has declined and back-slidden from
   him; Christ uses the same methods, and puts forth the same grace at one
   time as at the other; he draws "with the cords of love, and bands of a
   man." (2.) To supple and soften her hard heart, and make this rusty
   lock go easy: this oil of myrrh being left there, removed the hardness
   of her heart, the stiffness of her will, and the rustiness of her
   affections; this melted her hard heart, made her stubborn will pliable,
   set her affections on the flow, her faith in exercise, and made the
   lock of unbelief draw back more easy. (3.) To exercise and stir up her
   grace; it is Christ's grace, manifested and applied unto us, that
   excites ours; it is his love "shed abroad in our hearts by his Spirit,"
   that raises ours; for "we love him, because he first loved us." Now all
   these ends were answered hereby; it was this grace, this myrrh, left in
   the handles of the lock, that fetched her off her bed, that softened
   the hardness of her heart and affections to him, that removed the bars
   and bolts that kept him out, and drew forth her grace into exercise.

   Again, the church's hands and fingers being said to drop with myrrh,
   which Christ had put into the lock-hole, shows, 1. That all the grace,
   all the myrrh, that a believer has, comes from Christ; it is from "his
   fullness we receive grace for grace," that is, all sorts of grace. 2.
   That a believer has most reason to expect a larger measure of grace
   from Christ, when he is in the way of his duty; whilst the church was
   sluggish and slothful, negligent of her duty, and taking her ease upon
   a bed of security, there is no mention of the flowings of this myrrh
   into her or upon her; but now she is up, and in the way of her duty,
   her hands drop with myrrh, and her fingers with sweet-smelling myrrh:"
   not that our duties are deserving of any thing at Christ's hands, much
   less such large measures and over-flowings of grace as these; yet
   Christ has been graciously pleased, for an encouragement, to grant the
   promise of his presence, and the communications of his grace to us,
   when found in the way of our duty, though not for the performance of
   it. How the church succeeded in this attempt of hers, in opening the
   door, may be seen in the following words.

Chapter 5 Verse 6

   I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
   and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I
   could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words are,

   I.A fourth and last effect of Christ's "putting in his hand by the hole
   of the door;" she opened to him.

   II.The wretched disappointment she had met with; he "had withdrawn
   himself, and was gone."

   III.What effect this disappointment had upon her; her soul failed when
   he spake.

   IV.Her endeavors to find her lost spouse.

   I.Here is a fourth and last effect of Christ's "putting in his hand by
   the hole of the door," which is the exertion of his mighty and
   efficacious grace, "I opened to my beloved." This was what her beloved
   desired of her, and called for, in verse 2, and which was his principal
   end in exerting the power of his grace. Now this opening to him, is to
   be understood of the exercise of her faith, by which her heart was
   enlarged and dilated to receive Christ: faith is the eye, the ear, the
   mouth and hand of the soul; faith's eye being opened, sees the beauties
   and glories of Christ's person, and spies wondrous things in his
   gospel; its ear being open to discipline, listens to what Christ says
   in his promises and commands, and takes in the comfort of the one, and
   carefully observes the other; its mouth being opened, speaks of the
   promises of Christ, the glory of his person, office and undertakings;
   and its hand being opened, receives and embraces him, opens the door,
   and lets him in. From this act of the church, in opening to her
   beloved, may be observed, 1. That Christ had not only wrought in her a
   will, but had also given her a power to open to him; once she seemed to
   have but little inclination; her will did not seem so very free, being
   overpowered with sleep and sloth; and if her spirit was willing, yet it
   appears manifest that the flesh was weak; if she had a will to open,
   how to do it she knew not; but now, as by her rising off her bed,
   coming to the door, and putting her hands and fingers upon the handles
   of the lock, in order to draw it back, she showed that Christ had
   wrought in her to will; so by her actual opening to him, she made it
   appear that he had also wrought in her "to do of his good pleasure." 2.
   That she being assisted in this act by the mighty grace of Christ, is
   said to do that which is sometimes ascribed to God himself; thus in
   Acts 16:14, the Lord is said to open the heart of Lydia: it is true,
   there is a great difference between the opening of a sinner's heart at
   conversion, which is entirely shut against Christ; and the opening of a
   believer's, which is in part only shut and closed through unbelief,
   negligence, and carnal security: in the one, there were no principles
   of grace, previous to the opening of it; but in the other there are,
   though they lie dormant, and are not in exercise; but yet a believer,
   without the grace and power of Christ, can no more open his heart to
   him, when in such a case, than he could at first conversion: this work
   is attended with difficulties insuperable without the strength of
   Christ; therefore, whilst on her bed, she thought it impossible for her
   to do it, and unreasonable in him to desire it; till he put in his
   hand, and left such an abundance of the sweet-smelling myrrh of his
   grace, by which being assisted, she is said to do it. 3. That the heart
   of a believer is only patent and open to the Lord Jesus Christ, "I
   opened to my beloved;" though it is sometimes, an a great measure,
   dosed and shut unto him; yet when it is opened, it is only opened to
   him; he is the only object of a believer's faith and love: the church
   here did not open to strangers, only to her beloved, being espoused as
   a chaste virgin" to him; therefore, in chapter 4:12, she is said to be
   "a garden inclosed, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed." 4. Her
   opening to Christ, supposes that she thought Christ still at the door;
   so she did when she got off her bed to open to him; and so she did when
   she put her hands upon the handles of the lock; and perhaps was more
   confirmed in her thoughts, that he was still there, when she found such
   an abundance of his sweet-swelling myrrh in the lock, and upon the
   handles of it; but she was very much mistaken, as she afterwards found.
   For,

   II.Her "beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone;" a very great
   disappointment indeed! she expected, that as soon as ever the door was
   open, she should have seen him, and that he would have received her in
   his arms, and embraced her in his bosom; but instead of that, he was
   gone, and she could neither have any sight, nor hear any tidings of
   him. Here it may be inquired, 1st, What is meant by Christ's
   withdrawing himself from his church and people? 2dly, Why he did now
   with withdraw himself from the church? And, 3dly, Why she makes use of
   two words to express his departure from her, and what they import?

   1st, It may be inquired what is meant by Christ's withdrawing himself
   from his church and people? And, 1. It is not to be understood of him
   as the omnipresent God, who is every where, and fills heaven and earth
   with his presence; for as there is no fleeing from it, so there is no
   withdrawing of it, as David says (Ps. 139:7), "Whither shall I go from
   thy spirit, or whither shall I fly from thy presence?" there is no
   place exempted from it, nor can be; he does not move from place to
   place, nor from person to person; nor is he sometimes with a person,
   and sometimes not; for if so, he would not be the omnipresent God. Nor,
   2. Is it to be understood of the dissolution of a believer's
   covenant-interest in Christ, and union to him: a believer may lose
   sight of Christ for a time, but he can never lose his interest in him:
   the relation between them can never cease; the marriage-knot can never
   be untied, nor the union-bonds be, ever broken; for Christ has said,
   Hosea 2:19. "I will betroth thee unto me for ever:" the union between
   Christ and believers is in some measure like to that between the Father
   and the Son; and I will venture to say, that the one may as soon be
   dissolved as the other (see John 17:22, 23). Nor, 3. Is it to be
   understood of a withdrawing of his love and affection from them; for
   though they may sometimes think he has, yet he never does, nor never
   will withdraw it; his love to them is as unchangeable as himself; it is
   the " same yesterday, today, and for ever;" for "having loved his own,
   which were in the world, he loved them to the end;" he has given his
   word, that though he, "for a small moment forsakes them, yet with
   everlasting kindness will he have mercy on them;" and as if this was
   not enough, he joins his oath to it, and swears, that he "would not be
   wroth with them, nor rebuke them;" and declares, that his kindness and
   his covenant are as immoveable as, nay, more than mountains and hills;
   which, one would think, is enough to banish all doubts and fears from
   believers, and fill them with as firm a persuasion as the apostle Paul
   was possessed of, when he says, "I am persuaded that neither life nor
   death," etc. "shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which
   is in Christ Jesus our Lord." But, 4. It is to be understood of the
   withdrawing of the sensible manifestations of his presence and love:
   and this is what the church has experienced in all ages; for he is a
   God that "hideth his face from the house of Jacob;" and what particular
   believers have met with, as is manifest from David, Heman, and others.
   And this was what the church wanted, even some sensible enjoyments of
   Christ's presence and grace; she had his strengthening and supporting
   presence, which enabled her to rise and open; but she wanted his
   comforting and soul-rejoicing presence, and sensible communion with
   him; Christ's love is always the same, but the sense of it in believers
   is variable; the one is sometimes withdrawn, the other never.

   2dly, It may seem a little strange, and almost unaccountable, that
   Christ at this instant should withdraw himself from his church; seeing
   he had so importunately desired her to arise and open to him; had used
   all methods to win upon her, find by his grace had enabled her to do
   it; and yet now it is done, he withdraws himself and is gone: and
   therefore it is proper to inquire why he should do so; which was
   perhaps, 1. To chastise her for her former carriage to him: had he, as
   soon as she had opened the door, shown himself to her, and received her
   with all tokens of love and joy; she would not have thought the offense
   so great, nor that he was so much provoked by it, and did so highly
   resent it as he did; therefore to bring her to a sense of it, and to
   correct her for it, by suffering the loss of his company, he withdraws
   himself. 2. To try the truth and strength of her grace: her grace was
   now in exercise, as appears by her rising and opening; and now, the
   more to exercise it, and prove the strength of it, he with. draws
   himself: thus all our afflictions, temptations and desertions, are for
   the trial of our faith, and other graces; which being tried, appear
   "much more precious than of gold that perisheth." 3. To enflame her
   love, and sharpen her desires the more after him; which effect his
   withdrawing from her, in Song of Solomon 3:1-3, had upon her; and so it
   had here: many such instances we have in Job, David, and others; who,
   being without the presence of God, have the more earnestly wished for,
   vehemently thirsted, punted and breathed after a re-enjoyment of it
   (see Job 23:2; Ps. 43:1,2, 63:1); and it is usually so, that the want
   of a blessing, not only brings us under a conviction of the worth of
   it, and so draws out our affections to it, but also enlarges and
   increases our desires after it. 4. To endear his presence the more,
   when she came to enjoy it: when a soul has been destitute of Christ's
   presence for a time, and come to enjoy it again, O how sweet, ravishing
   and delightful is it to him! and how much it is valued by him! the
   disciples were without Christ's bodily presence but a few days; and
   when he appeared to them, we are told (John 20:20), that "then were the
   disciples glad, when they saw the Lord;" and what expressions of joy,
   and intimations of esteem for Christ's presence, does the church give,
   in Song of Solomon 3:4, when she had found her lost spouse? 5. To keep
   her humble: had she immediately enjoyed his presence upon her rising
   and opening to him, she might dare thought that she had, by those
   actions of hers, deserved such a favor at his hands; therefore, to hide
   pride from her, and to let her know the nothingness of all her doings,
   and that they fell abundantly short of meriting such a blessing, he
   withdraws himself: our enjoyment of Christ's presence, and the
   communications of his love and grace to us, as much depend on his free
   and sovereign will, as the first display of his grace to us; he gives
   these favors at pleasure, and that to whom, when, and where he pleases.
   6. To show her the odious nature of sin, which was the cause of this.;
   and that she might, through grace, be more upon her guard against it,
   and be more cautious of provoking him to it again: it was sin that was
   the cause of the angel's being turned out of heaven, the place of the
   divine abode; and of Adam's being drove out of Eden, from the presence
   of the Lord God; and though sin cannot dissolve the union that is
   between Christ and a believer, nor destroy his covenant-interest in
   him; yet it is often the cause of God's hiding his face, and Christ's
   withdrawing his presence from him; "Your iniquities have separated
   between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you,"
   says the prophet Isaiah 59:2, to the people of Israel; and it was the
   church's unbecoming carriage to Christ, which was the cause of his
   withdrawing from her now; and therefore to bring here to a sense of it,
   and to see the odious nature thereof, he withdraws himself; that when
   she enjoyed it again, she might be more careful not to provoke him
   again by such steps as these: and such an effect it had upon her, in
   Song of Solomon 3:4,5, where she not only held him fast herself, and
   would not let him go; but also charges the daughters of Jerusalem to
   give him no molestation or disturbance.

   3dly, The church makes use of two words here to express Christ's
   departure from her, "My beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone,"
   which signify and import, 1. That this was done suddenly and secretly,
   unseen, at an unawares to her, and unexpected by her; so the word
   translated, "had withdrawn himself," [629] , signifies a doing it
   secretly; he "turned himself about, and was gone" [630] in a moment; he
   withdrew himself privately from the door, and passed by the window, and
   was gone; so that she could not set eyes upon him, nor hear any tidings
   of him. 2. That he was gone at a very great distance in her
   apprehensions: so believers think sometimes, when Christ has withdrawn
   himself from them, that he is gone a great way off, is not within call,
   and will never return more (see Ps. 10:1); and this is thought by some
   [631] , to be the import of the first word; and the other, being added
   to it, heightens the sense. 3. That he was really gone: it was not u
   mere imagination of hers, but it was certainly so; which she found to
   her great grief and sorrow. 4. The doubling of the words, or her using
   those two words without a copulative, he "had withdrawn himself, was
   gone," which she seems to speak in the utmost haste and confusion,
   represent the strength of her passion, the greatness of her sorrow,
   what a wretched disappointment she met with; and as if she was wringing
   her hands, and crying outs "He is gone, he is gone, he is gone." Which
   brings us to consider,

   III.What effect this disappointment had upon her; "my soul," says she,
   "failed when he spoke," or went out [632] ; I was as one dead, I
   immediately fell into a swoon, and was as one whose life and soul
   departed. Some [633] think that the church in these words excuses
   herself from the blame of not rising and opening to him sooner; as if
   she should say, I am not so much to be blamed, nor has my beloved so
   much reason to be provoked at, nor so highly to resent my not rising
   and opening sooner; for as soon as ever I heard his voice, saying,
   "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove," etc., it overcame my heart,
   my soul failed at these words of his; I immediately fell into a swoon,
   and lay as one lifeless and helpless, and was not able to rise and open
   to him; but as soon as ever I came to my senses, and was recovered a
   little out of this fit, I arose and opened to him: but it does not
   appear from the context, that side did fall into such a fit at his
   calling to her, or was rendered non combos mentis; for she was capable
   all the while of observing all his words and ways; how he carried
   himself to her, and proceeded with her; what steps he took, and methods
   he used, till he had brought her to arise and open, Therefore the words
   seem rather to be expressive of that confusion of mind she was thrown
   into, when she found he was gone; even as it is said of the queen of
   Sheba, that "there was no more spirit in her;" occasioned through
   wonder and surprise in beholding Solomon's wisdom, and the order and
   management of his house and servants, that she knew not what to think
   or what to say: so the church here being surprised at Christ's absence,
   her soul fails her, no spirit is left in her; she knew not what to
   think, say, or do: or else they are expressive of the exceeding grief
   and sorrow that she was overwhelmed with; "my soul failed when he
   spoke," or "at his word" [634] ; that is, at the remembrance of it: O!
   now I call to mind how lovingly, kindly, and tenderly he spoke to me,
   when he said, "Open to me, my sister, my love," etc., yet, vile,
   ungrateful wretch, as I am, I took no notice of it; I put him off with
   idle excuses, I kept my bed and indulged myself in sloth and ease; but
   now it cuts me to the heart, it grieves me, t cannot bear up under it;
   when I remember his love, and my unkindness, I sink, I faint, I die; I
   cannot live without his presence; his absence is death unto me; my soul
   fails at his words of love and grace which he spoke to me, and at his
   word of command which he enjoined me; to which, being disobedient, I
   have now lost his company, which is intolerable to me. She seems to be
   much in the same case that the Psalmist was, when he said (Ps. 143:7),
   "Hear me speedily, O Lord, my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from
   me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit."

   IV.Being somewhat recovered out of her fainting fit, she rallied
   together all the spirit and strength she had, and out she goes in
   search of her lost spouse; the methods she took, and how she succeeded
   therein, are as follow:

   1st, She sought him, namely, in the public ordinances, "in the streets
   and broad ways of the city," as she had done before, in Song of Solomon
   3:2, and that with the same success; "she sought him, but found him
   not." The nature of seeking a lost Christ, and how to be performed, as
   also why the church succeeded no better, have been there shown; which
   will equally serve to explain and illustrate this.

   2dly, She called him, to wit, by name, as she went along the streets
   and broad ways; that is, she prayed unto him, that he would manifest
   himself to her in his own ordinances; and no doubt but the method she
   took was right, and may serve to instruct us, that we should not only
   before we attended upon an ordinance, pray for the presence of Christ
   in it; but also, when we are attending, our souls should be breathing
   after, and secretly begging for it. But how did she succeed herein? she
   "called him, but he gave her no answer;" resolving still to chastise
   her for her former ingratitude; to try her faith, and exercise her
   patience; to enflame her love to him, and increase her desires after
   communion with him. But, 1. This seems contrary to those kind promises;
   "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find, etc. call
   upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee," etc. but she
   asked, and it was not given to her what she asked for; she sought, but
   found not; she called, but no answer is returned: to which it may be
   replied, that God does, and certainly will make good his own promises,
   and fulfill the petitions of his people; yet he does not always answer
   immediately, nor just in that way which they are desirous of the church
   had his upholding presence, though not sensible communion with him; she
   was so far answered, as to be "strengthened with strength in her soul,"
   to continue in her search and inquiries after him; though she had not
   those manifestations of his grace and love, which she was desirous of.
   2. It is a very great affliction to a believer, when he labors under
   such apprehensions, that his prayers are not heard and answered; the
   church mentions this among her sore afflictions, in Lamentations
   3:8,44, that God had "shut out her prayer," and had "covered himself
   with a cloud, that her prayer should not pass through:" unconverted
   men, hypocrites and carnal professors, are not concerned about the
   answer of their prayers; it is enough to them to perform these duties;
   but believers are concerned about the returns of prayer, and, are
   grieved to the heart, as the church here was, when they cannot observe
   any. 3. Christ here treats her just in the same way in which she had
   treated him; she is paid in her own coin; he had called to her, but she
   disregarded him, and turned a deaf ear to him, and returned him no
   answer, that deserved the name of one; she now calls to him, but he
   disregards her, turns a deaf ear to her, and gives her no answer; he
   treats her here, not in a way of vindictive wrath and punishment, as he
   will do the wicked at the last day (see Prov. 1:24-28); but in a way of
   chastisement and correction. What success she afterwards met with, will
   be seen in the following verses.

Chapter 5 Verse 7

   The watchmen, that went about the city, found me; they smote me,
   they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from
   me.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church in the former verse gives an account of the wretched
   disappointment she met with, when she opened the door to her beloved,
   who had withdrawn himself, and was gone; at which she fell into a
   fainting fit, out of which, when she was a little recovered, she
   resolved not to stay at the door, lamenting the loss of her spouse, but
   to go out in search of him, which she did, but with no success; and she
   does in these words give an account of what she met with in the
   adventure; how she was taken up by the watch, and evilly treated by
   them. Where we have to consider,

   I.Her being found by "the watchmen that went about the city, and
   "keepers of the walls."

   II.Their treatment of her, and carriage to her.

   I.In this search of her beloved, she falls into the hands of the
   watchmen that went about the city, and the keepers of the walls
   thereof; who were officers of the church, set for the defense of it,
   and for the administration of those ordinances, in which she sought her
   beloved; and the description of them, or these titles and characters
   which they bear, may lead us to observe,

   1st, That the church is a city: and no doubt is called so, in allusion
   to the city of Jerusalem, which was builded as a city that is compact
   together; it was the metropolis of the land of Judea, where Solomon
   kept his court, was well fortified, and delightfully situated; and
   therefore the church militant, as well as the church triumphant, is
   called by the same name; which is the city of God; of which the
   psalmist says (Ps. 87:3). Glorious things are spoken; it is the place
   of the residence of the King of kings; where his honor dwells, where he
   keeps his court, and has his palace; and therefore is called the city
   of the great King, in whose palaces God is known for a refuge; here he
   shows himself, here he maybe seen; therefore she was in the right of it
   to seek him here: in this city are all needful and delightful
   accommodations; it is beautiful for situation, a river of boundless
   love and grace runs through it, whose streams supply, refresh, and make
   glad the inhabitants of it; here are the best provisions to be had,
   which are called the goodness and fatness of God's house; here are the
   most delightful company, and agreeable conversation; here souls have
   fellowship with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ; those who
   are brought unto, and are made inhabitants of this city of the living
   God, have communion with an innumerable company of angels, and spirits
   of just men made perfect by Christ's righteousness: in this city are
   many special and peculiar privileges and immunities, which the
   inhabitants of it enjoy; for being Christ's freemen, and freemen of
   this city, they have a right to all the ordinances of the gospel, and
   share in all the promises which concern the grace and presence of
   Christ; they are under no obligation to any other laws but those of
   Christ's, and are freed from the curses and condemnation of the law of
   works; so that to be a citizen of this city, and a fellow-citizen of
   the saints, is no, small privilege (see Eph. 2:19; Rev. 3:12); But of
   the church's being compared to a city, see mote on chapter 3:2.

   2dly, Mention being made of the keepers of the walls of this city,
   shews us, that this city of God is a walled one; it is a fortified
   place, even as Jerusalem was, to which the allusion is made, when the
   church of God is spoken of; as in Psalm 51:18, and 122:7, and it may be
   proper to inquire what are the walls of the church, which render it
   strong and impregnable. And, 1. God himself is the wall of it,
   according to what he himself says, Zechariah 2:5, "For I, saith the
   Lord, will be a wall of fire round about it, and will be the glory in
   the midst of her;" he is not only a wall that keeps the enemy from
   entrance into the city, but a wall of fire that consumes and destroys
   all that make near approaches to it; all the divine perfections are as
   so many walls, which encompass and defend the church; especially that
   of Almighty power, by which saints are kept as in a garrison [635] ,
   through faith unto salvation: Jerusalem was fortified, not only by art,
   but also by nature, not only with walls, but with mountains; and "as
   the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round. about
   his people, from henceforth, even for ever," (Ps. 125:2). 2. Salvation
   by Christ is the church's wall, which render it strong and impregnable:
   hence we read, in Isaiah 26:1. In that day, that is, in the gospel day,
   when salvation is accomplished by Christ, "shall this song be sung in
   the land of Judah, We have a strong city; "But what is it which makes
   it so? salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks: and, this
   song will be sung more clearly in the latter day, when the church shall
   call her walls, salvation, and her gates, praise: salvation wrought out
   by Christ, is the church's protection from all enemies; hereby
   believers are screened and secured from sin and Satan, law, hell, and
   wrath to come; no enemy" can destroy them, no condemnation reach them,
   nor any wrath fall on them; but they shall be "saved in the Lord with
   an everlasting salvation." 3. Ministers may be called so, who are set
   for the defense of the gospel: so the Lord told Jeremiah, chapter 1:18,
   that he had made him a defensed city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls
   against the whole land; though they seem not to be intended here,
   because they are called the keepers of the walls, and not the walls
   themselves. Now the city of God being thus walled and fortified, shows,
   (1.) That it would otherwise be in danger from enemies: for the church
   of Christ has many enemies, who are lively and strong, crafty and
   cunning, vigilant and active, seeking all opportunities to get within,
   and there make disturbance, and do mischief: but this city is so well
   walled and firmly built, that let Satan, with all his emissaries, use
   all their power and cunning, and lay the closest siege unto it, the
   gates of hell will never be able to prevail against it. (2.) The great
   care which God takes of his church and people; for as birds flying or
   fluttering over and about their nest, in order to preserve their young,
   when they are in danger of being taken away from them; " so will the
   Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also, he will deliver it; and
   passing over, he will preserve it," as it is said in Isaiah 31:5, which
   care for their preservation, is manifestly seen in his placing such
   walls about it.

   3dly, In this city are proper officers appointed and set to watch over
   and guard it; and these go under two titles or characters in the text.
   1. They are called "watchmen that went about the city:" these are the
   ministers of the church, who are called so both in the Old and New
   Testament; because they ought to watch over themselves, their doctrine
   and conversation, and to watch over others, who are made their care and
   charge: the business of watchmen is also to give the time of night, to
   give notice of present or approaching danger, either by fire or by
   thieves and robbers, and to take up disorderly persons, and bring them
   to correction: so the ministers of the gospel give notice what time of
   clay or night it is with the churches of Christ; they give notice to
   sinners of the danger which they are in, whilst in a state of nature;
   and also what danger churches may be in, through contentious persons
   and heretics, who endeavor to sow the seeds of discord, error and
   heresy among them; likewise their business is to awake and arouse
   sleepy professors, who are indulging themselves in carnal ease and
   security in the streets of Zion; and to admonish, reprove, and rebuke
   all that stand in need thereof, and so bring them under the notice and
   censure of the church. These are said to go about the city, (1.) To
   distinguish them from those upon the walls: those that went about the
   city, were to take care of the peace and safety of the city within; the
   keepers of the walls were to descry an enemy without, observe his
   motions, repel him, if able, and to give notice to those within of
   danger from him; the one was a running watch, the other a standing one.
   (2.) To show the nature of their work, and their diligence in it: it
   was the business of the keepers of the walls, to keep their stands, and
   not stir from their places; but the work of these was to go from place
   to place, to see that all was in peace and safety; but of these
   watchmen, see more in chapter 3:3. 2. These officers are called
   "keepers of the walls;" by "which some [636] understand angels, who
   encamp about, and protect the people of God; others [637] , civil
   magistrates, who, the apostle says, Romans 13:3,4 are not " terrors to
   good works, but to the evil;" and that "he is the minister of God for
   good, and beareth not the sword in vain:" but if these were civil
   magistrates, they terrified the church in the way of her duty, and
   discouraged her in it; nay, turned the point of their swords against
   her, as often the princes of this world do, being ignorant of Christ
   and his church: but I rather think church-officers are here intended,
   and that they are the same with the watch-men who went about the city;
   only they may be expressive of different branches in the ministry, or
   of different talents which ministers have, and are to use in the
   discharge of their work: some, their work chiefly lies in comforting
   and establishing the church, in answering cases of conscience, and
   keeping peace and order within; and they have gifts suitable thereunto;
   and these may be called watchmen that go about the city: others, their
   work lies chiefly in defending the gospel against the avowed enemies of
   it; these keep the outworks good, and repel the enemy, whenever he
   makes an attack upon any doctrine of the gospel; and these may be
   called "the keepers or watchmen of the walls;" and so ministers are
   called in Isaiah 62:6. The Jews in Shirhashirim Rabba, and in Yalkut on
   the place, understand by these keepers, the tribe of Levi, the keepers
   of the walls of the law.

   But it may now be inquired, whether these were the true ministers of
   Christ, or no: some [638] think that they were; they are called
   watchmen, and watchmen in the city, the church, though it is true,
   false teachers may bear the same name as true ones, and be in office in
   the church as well as they; but what seems most to strengthen this
   opinion, is, that they Mere about their work, and in the discharge of
   their office; the watchmen were going about the city, as they should
   do, and the keepers of the walls were upon their stands, as they ought
   to be: others [639] think that they were not the true and faithful
   ministers of the gospel; but such who are called "blind watchmen, etc."
   in Isaiah 56:10, 11, and that, (1.) Because the church makes no inquiry
   of them, nor any application to them, which she did in a like case to
   the watchmen, in Song of Solomon 3:3, and therefore it seems to
   intimate, that she, not looking upon them as ministers of Christ, had
   nothing to say to them, but would have shunned them if she could. (2.)
   Because of their cruelty to her: they are not so pitiful, compassionate
   and tender, as becomes the ministers of Christ to be to souls in such
   cases; they seem rather to be ravenous wolves, than faithful shepherds
   or watchmen, and are most like those in Ezekiel 34:2-21. Plato [640]
   says, keepers of cities should be mild and gentle towards their own,
   but to enemies rough and severe.

   Now these found the church seeking and inquiring for her beloved; which
   shows, that she was in the city, in the streets and broad ways of it:
   she searched all over the city, where the watchmen that went about it,
   found her; and, escaping from them with blows and wounds, finding that
   her beloved was not there, she makes to the outparts of the city,
   perhaps designing to go without the city in search of him, where she
   fell into the hands of the keepers of the walls. This finding of her,
   also appears to be accidental and at an unawares; they were not seeking
   her, nor was she inquiring after them; it was on a sudden that they
   found her; and as soon as they did find her, they fell upon her, and
   took her up for a stroller or night-walker; and by their treatment of
   her, manifestly showed that they found her, not as a friend, but as an
   enemy; and therefore did not let her go safe, but with blows, wounds,
   and the loss of her veil. Which brings us to consider,

   II.Their treatment of her, and carriage to her. And,

   1st, "The watchmen, that went about the city, smote and wounded her;"
   which, if we understand of the true ministers of the gospel (though I
   rather think that others are intended) must be meant, either of their
   upbraiding and reproaching her for her former unkindness to Christ, and
   negligence of her duty; when they told her, and hit her in the teeth of
   her former sins and miscarriages, they smote and cut her to the heart,
   opened the wound, and made it bleed afresh; and so, like Job's friends,
   proved miserable comforters, who broke him in pieces with words, with
   words both of reproof and reproach they laid open her sins to her, and
   sharply reproved her for them, when they should have comforted her with
   the doctrines of justification by Christ's righteousness, and pardon by
   his blood; for Christ's own ministers may sometimes be mistaken in
   timing reproofs and corrections; or else, she being under the ministry
   of the word, and hearing some sweet discourses concerning Christ's
   person and grace, her heart was smitten and wounded therewith, which
   made her charge the daughters of Jerusalem, in the following verse,
   that when they found her beloved, they would tell him, that she was
   sick of, or wounded with love. But if we understand it of false
   teachers, which seems most agreeable; then by those smitings and
   woundings, are meant, the scandalous lives of such persons, the rents
   and divisions they make, the false doctrines which they preach; and
   those human traditions, which with force, they impose upon the
   consciences of men, being assisted by civil magistrates, whom they stir
   up to make penal laws, and put them in execution against the saints; by
   all which means they make the hearts of the righteous sad, and wound
   the consciences of God's children. One of the Greek versions is, "they
   scourged me," [641] whipped her till she was black and blue; as the
   Jews did the first Christians in their synagogues.

   2dly, "The keepers of the walls took away her veil from her:" veils
   were used by women in those countries: sometimes for ornament (Isa.
   3:23), sometimes as a token of modesty; thus Rebekah, when she found
   that Isaac was coming to meet her, covered herself with a veil (Gen.
   24:65), and sometimes as a token of subjection to the husband; for
   which the apostle argues, that women ought to be covered (1 Cor.
   11:6-10), at marriage, it was customary with the Grecians [642] , to
   give a veil to the new-married bride ; the bridegroom, with the Romans,
   used to give the bride a veil, called flammeum [643] , from its being
   of a flame-color, either yellow or red, expressive of the blushing and
   modesty of the new bride [644] ; and the like custom might obtain with
   the Jews. Now for the keepers to take away her veil from her, was to
   strip her of her ornaments, and expose her frailties and infirmities,
   which ought to be covered; it was to disown her as the spouse of
   Christ, and to represent her as a whorish and impudent woman; and,
   whereas she professed herself to be Christ's, to serve him in the way
   of his appointments; they endeavored to "corrupt her from the
   simplicity that is in Christ," and to draw her aside to a reception of
   false doctrines, and to a compliance with human traditions: and then
   more especially, may they be said to take away her veil, when they
   oppose and endeavor to subvert or remove the doctrine of imputed
   righteousness by Christ; Christ's righteousness is the believer's veil
   or covering; this is "the wedding garment, perizolaion numfikon, the
   nuptial robe, as Gregory Nyssen [645] calls the veil here; and when
   persons attempt to take away this doctrine, they do as much as in them
   lies to take away the church's veil. And now all this cruelty was
   exercised by persons professing religion, under a mask of godliness; by
   those who were officers in the church, from whom she might have
   expected a quite different treatment; and indeed, who were more bitter
   enemies to Christ and his apostles, than the priests and Pharisees
   were? and who have more cruelly persecuted in after-ages, than those
   who have professed Christianity! The church thus escaping from the
   watchmen and keepers, with blows, wounds, and the loss of her veil,
   meets with the daughters of Jerusalem, to whom she speaks in the
   following manner.

Chapter 5 Verse 8

   I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
   if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having met with a disappointment, as has been
   observed in verse 6 by her beloved's withdrawing-himself from her; but
   resolving to find him, if possible, she seeks for him in the public
   ordinances; where she is taken notice of by the officers of the church,
   "the watchmen of the city, and keepers of the walls;" who very much
   abuse her; "smite and wound" her, and take away her veil from her; by
   reason of which, she making a hideous outcry in the streets, the
   "daughters of Jerusalem," the wise virgins, who were then sleeping and
   slumbering on their beds, were awakened and alarmed, and rose up to
   know what was the matter; who being observed by the church, had the
   charge in the text given unto them by her. In which we have,

   I.The persons whom she addresses, and in this solemn manner adjures;
   "the daughters of Jerusalem."

   II.The charge itself, which she gives them; which is, to tell her
   beloved, when found by" them, that she was "sick of love."

   III.The condition of this charge; "if ye find my beloved."

   IV.The manner in which this charge is given, which is very solemn and
   serious.

   I.The persons to whom she gives this charge; "the daughters of
   Jerusalem:" by whom we are not to understand the prophets, as the
   Targum does; though these were proper persons for the church to make
   application to in her present condition; but having been so evilly
   treated by the watchmen and keepers of the walls, she had but little
   encouragement to go to them: nor are angels here meant, as some [646]
   think though they are "ministering, spirits, sent to the heirs of
   salvation," and are often useful to the saints on many accounts; yet it
   does not seem to be their business, nor are they capable of assisting
   and relieving souls in such a case as this of the church's: nor are
   "saints departed" meant, as some popish interpreters [647] imagine: as
   if the church desired their prayers for her, who are uncapable, of
   giving her any assistance: but by them we are to understand saints here
   on earth, the friends and companions of the church, which bel;ong to
   that Jerusalem, which "is free, and is the mother of us all;" these
   were fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;"
   perhaps were young converts, as has been observed in other places of
   this Song; and it is certain, that they were believers of the weaker
   sort; their knowledge of Christ was but small, though they had a great
   respect for the church, and a desire of sucking Christ with her, verse
   9 and Song of Solomon 6:1. The church now making application to these
   persons in her disconsolate condition, shows, 1. Her humility: that she
   is willing to be assisted by mean Christians or weak believers, who
   were much inferior to her in faith and knowledge; it is the nature of
   grace, and the tendency of such trying dispensations as these, in which
   the church was, to make and keep souls humble; the more grace they
   have, the more humble they will be; the greatest believer reckoned
   himself the "least of saints, and the chief of sinners," and is willing
   to be instructed and admonished by the meanest saint (see Ps. 141:5);
   and is glad of the prayers and assistance of weak believers, when in
   distress. 2. Her resolution to use all means to find her beloved, as
   Job did, Job 23:8,9, she will leave no stone unturned, nor let slip any
   opportunity, where there was any probability or possibility of finding
   him; she had sought him in public ordinances, but with no success; nay,
   had met with ill treatment front church-officers; yet she is not
   discouraged, but is resolved to persist in her search of him; she had
   spread her case before Christ in prayer, and could get no answer; and
   now she betakes herself to the company of private Christians, that by
   conference with them, and through their prayers for her, she might be
   brought to the enjoyment of what she was seeking after. 3. That
   communion and conversation with saints is a very proper method to be
   taken by believers in such cases; conversing together about the things
   of God, is very acceptable and well-pleasing to him: it is said,
   Malachi 3:16, of the saints, who "spake often one to another, that the
   Lord hearkened and heard, listened as it were unto it, and took such
   notice of it, that "a book of remembrance was written before him" for
   them; he did, as it were, take notes and minutes of what they said and
   thought, and laid them up: as we should spread our cases before God; so
   it is very proper, and often very useful, to spread our case before one
   another; and therefore there should not be a "forsaking the assembling
   of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but so much the more
   should" we assemble together, as our various wants and cases require.
   4. That when souls are in distress, it is their duty and interest to
   make application to others; they should not only pray for themselves,
   which should be done in the first place, but they should also desire
   the prayers of others for them; for "the effectual fervent prayer of a
   righteous man availeth much:" and it is no disgrace nor dishonor for a
   person superior in office, gifts, and graces to others, to desire their
   assistance by their prayers for him at the throne of grace; instances
   of this we have, not only in the church here, but in that great man of
   God, and instance of grace, the apostle Paul, who frequently desired
   the prayers of meaner saints for him (see Eph. 6:19; 1 Thess. 3:1, 2).
   5. That it is the duty of saints to be assisting to each other in their
   distresses, as much as in them lies; by singing the praises of God
   together, by praying one with and for another, and by conferring with
   each other about divine things, and so building up one another on their
   most holy faith: there ought to be a sympathizing spirit in the saints;
   they should "bear one another's burdens, and should mutually help each
   other; they should weep with those that weep, and rejoice with those
   that rejoice." But,

   II.Let us consider the charge itself, which is given to them by her;
   and that is to tell her beloved, when they found him, that she was sick
   of love. This does not suppose that he was ignorant or unmindful of her
   present state; he heard her, though he would not answer; he knew that
   she was inquiring after him, and what hardships she underwent in doing
   it; and also, how much her soul was filled with love to him, and longed
   for the enjoyment of him; though he would not immediately show himself,
   intending a little longer to chastise her for her former carriage to
   him: but the words shew the ardency of her love to Christ, and that she
   would have them declare this to him, in their prayers for her, which
   she thought might be a means to induce him to manifest himself to her;
   as also they show what familiarity souls may use at the throne of grace
   what freedom they may take with Christ, when they come into his
   presence, "tell him that I am sick of love." They may tell him their
   own cases, and the cases of others, as one friend may tell another, or
   as a child may tell its father; they may go with boldness to him, and
   spread their own and others cases before him, without fear of being
   chided or upbraided by him; and indeed it is their duty to bear upon
   their minds, at the throne of grace, not only their own cases, and the
   cases of the churches in general, as the apostle Paul frequently did;
   but also the cases of particular persons, whom they know to be in
   distress; therefore Christ taught his disciples to pray after this
   manner, "Our Father, etc. and forgive us our debts, etc." to show that
   they should be concerned for others in prayer, as well as for
   themselves. The words in the Hebrew text may be rendered thus, "What
   shall ye, or should ye tell him?" [648] as if she should say, Do not
   tell him the blows and wounds that I have received from the watchmen;
   nor desire him to revenge the injuries and affronts they have given me,
   I freely forgive them; nor am I so much concerned at the sufferings
   that I undergo, as I am for the loss of him: "What shall ye tell him ?"
   Tell him that which lies most upon my heart, under which I shall sink
   and die, if he does not relieve me; "tell him that I am sick of love."
   Again, What shall ye tell him? Tell him that which will be the most
   acceptable and agreeable to him; tell him I love him so, that I cannot
   live without him: she knew that he valued her love, and that his heart
   would be ravished with it, from what he had said, Song of Solomon
   4:9,10, and therefore would have this told him. Again, "What shall ye
   tell him?" What shall I say to you to tell him? I have a great many
   things to tell him of; but I will not overburden your memories, but I
   will give you my mind in a few words, in the most concise manner, "tell
   him that I am sick of love;" and when I meet with him myself, I will
   tell him all my mind; but for the present, only tell him this. But let
   us a little more particularly consider the matter of this charge, or
   what the church would have the daughters of Jerusalem tell Christ, when
   they found him; which is, that she was "sick of love." And it will be
   proper to inquire,

   1st, The causes of this sickness; which sometimes are, 1. A want of the
   views of pardoning grace, under a sense of sin, which perhaps was the
   case of the church here; she had sinned against Christ, in neglecting
   to arise and open to him; and she was now sensible of it, but wanted
   the manifestations of pardon; and was therefore in a languishing and
   fainting condition on the account of it; and it is only this which will
   cure this sickness: "The inhabitant shall not say, I am sick;" Why so?
   "the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity;" that
   is, they shall have the manifestations of pardoning grace to their
   souls, which shall cure them of their sicknesses and maladies; which
   was what the church here wanted. 2. The absence of Christ is sometimes
   the cause of this sickness; and this also was the church's case: Christ
   had "withdrawn himself from her, and was gone, as in Song of Solomon
   5:6, and though she had diligently sought him, yet she could not find
   him, nor hear any thing of him; and this brought this sickness upon
   her. 3. An eager longing after Christ's presence, and the discoveries
   of his love, is another cause of it: when a soul has sought Christ a
   long time in ordinances, and cannot find him; has lived in the hope and
   expectation of enjoying his presence time after time, and yet is still
   at a loss for him, then comes this sickness upon it; for, as Solomon
   says (Prov. 13:12), "hope deferred maketh the heart sick." 4. Sometimes
   the large discoveries of love which believers have, cause a sickness,
   which may be called a love-sickness; and this is what the church speaks
   of, in Song of Solomon 2:5, "stay me with flagons, comfort me with
   apples; for I am sick of love:" she had been with Christ in his
   wine-cellar or banqueting-house, and had as much of his love let into
   her soul, as sloe could hold, nay, more; she was overpowered with it;
   "his banner over" her had been love. But this was not the church's case
   here; her sickness here arises rather from the aforesaid causes, and
   chiefly from a want of that love which she had such large discoveries
   of there.

   2dly, It may not be amiss to consider the nature and properties of this
   sickness. And, 1. It is not a sickness unto death; none ever died of
   this sickness; Christ will never suffer any to die with love for him;
   for he "loves them that love him," and will cause them "to inherit
   substance;" to enjoy himself, the substance of all felicity; and to
   inherit eternal glory, which is the better and the "more enduring
   substance;" where they shall have sweet and uninterrupted communion
   with him. Yet, 2. It is a very sore and painful sickness; like
   Hezekiah's, it is a pining one; and oftentimes wastes the body, as well
   as affects the mind: The Septuagint render it, "for I am wounded with
   love;" which gave her a great deal of pain and uneasiness; for "love is
   as strong as death." 3. It is an immedicable sickness without the
   enjoyment of Christ, the object loved; bodily physicians cannot cure
   it; these are in this case, like Job's physicians, of no value; merry
   companions are of no service to remove it; the enjoyment of another
   beloved will not do; the language of a soul in such a case, is, None
   but Christ, none but Christ; give me Christ, or I die; I cannot live
   without him: this sickness can only be cured by the object loved, and
   this infallibly cures; for, "as hope deferred maketh the heart sick, so
   when the desire cometh it is a tree of life."

   3rdly, We may now consider the evidences of this love-sickness, or how
   it manifests itself: and, 1. There is in souls that labor under it, a
   violent pulsation and punting of the heart after Christ, even "as the
   heart panteth after the water-brooks;" they are restless and uneasy
   without him; their thoughts are continually running upon him; the
   desire of their souls, night and day, "is to his name, and to the
   remembrance of him." 2. They are prodigious jealous of him and his
   love; and this is exceeding afflicting to them; for "jealousy is as
   cruel as the grave:" they are exceedingly afraid that he does not love
   them or that he loves others better than them; for, as the poet [649]
   says, Res est soliciti plena timoris amor. 3. They are very active and
   diligent, careful and industrious to gain his love; they use all the
   methods and stratagems they can devise; are bold and resolute, are not
   discouraged at any difficulties, bat are willing to run all risks for
   the enjoyment of him. 4. They love to hear his name mentioned, and
   especially to be spoken well of; his name to them is "as ointment
   poured forth," exceeding grateful; it attracts their love, "therefore
   do the virgins love" him; they love his ways, his ordinances and his
   doctrines, and cannot bear to hear them spoken against; they love to
   look upon and converse with his people, because they are like him, and
   bear a resemblance to him.

   III.The condition of this charge is, "if ye find him;" which shews, 1.
   That at present these daughters of Jerusalem had not any sight of
   Christ, nor communion with him; and this appears also manifestly from
   the following verse, where they inquire of her concerning him. 2. That
   it was possible that they might find him before she did; for Christ is
   sometimes "found of them that sought him not," and is "made manifest
   unto them that asked not after" him; she was inquiring after Christ but
   found him not; and yet it was possible that they might find him before
   her, who had not been seeking after him: also Christ may manifest
   himself to poor, mean, and weak believers, when he does not to some
   that are superior to them in faith, light, and knowledge; he showed
   himself after his resurrection to a poor woman, to Mary Magdalene, out
   of whom he cast seven devils, before he did to his disciples. 3. That
   when they did find Christ, and had liberty of access to his presence,
   that they would then spread her sorrowful case before him, and use
   their interest with him, to take pity and compassion on her; who was
   "sick of love" for him; she entreats them to do such a favor for her,
   as Joseph requested of the chief butler, when he should be restored to
   his place; says he Genesis 40:12. "But think on me, when it shall be
   well with thee; and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me; and make
   mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house." So the
   church would have these virgins, when it was well with them when they
   enjoyed the presence of. Christ, to think on her and her sorrowful
   case, and make mention of it to him.

   IV.This charge is delivered in a very solemn manner; "I adjure you
   [650] ," or "I put you to your oath, I make you swear," as the word
   signifies, that when you find him, you will tell him what I have said
   to you; I have given you your oath to do it: and now as you will answer
   it before God, in whose name and presence you have taken it, that you
   will carefully observe what I say to you, and faithfully deliver the
   message; if you have any regard to this solemn oath you have taken, or
   any love to me, I beg you will tell him that I am sick of love. She
   delivers herself in this solemn manner, not only to show the strength
   of her love to him, and that she was hearty and sincere in her search
   and inquiries after him: but also that she was serious in what she said
   to them, and would have them be serious, diligent, and faithful in
   telling her case to Christ. The answer returned by them, is as follows.

Chapter 5 Verse 9

   What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest
   among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved,
   that thou dost so charge us?
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having solemnly adjured the daughters of Jerusalem,
   that when they found her beloved, they would tell him that she was sick
   of love In these words we have their reply to her, which show what an
   opinion they had of her, and what effect her words had upon them: in
   which may be observed,

   I.The title and character they give her; "O thou fairest among women."

   II.A question they propose to her; "What is thy beloved more than
   another beloved?"

   III.This question repeated; where the reason of it must be considered.

   IV.What the occasion was of their putting this question to her; which
   was her solemn charge, "that thou dost so charge us?"

   I.The title or character which they give her, the "fairest among
   women;" which is expressive of the exceeding greatness of her beauty:
   she was not only fair, but the fairest, and that among women, whose
   beauty is excelling; she was the fairest of any of her sex; not as she
   was in herself, but as she is in Christ, justified by his
   righteousness, washed in his blood, and sanctified by his Spirit; and
   being considered thus, she appeared to these daughters, as indeed she
   really is, a perfection of beauty; and they were not mistaken herein,
   to Christ, who knew her perfectly well, and from whom she received her
   comeliness, gives her the same character in the very same words, in
   chapter 1:8, but then this opinion, which they entertained of her,
   though it entirely corresponds with that which Christ has entertained
   of her, yet is extremely different from that which the world has
   embraced; which shows, that these persons were not of this world, but
   called by grace out of it, seeing they had different sentiments of the
   church; the saints are by the world esteemed the filth thereof, and the
   off-scouring of all things; they are accounted by them the foolish,
   base, weak, and contemptible things of the world; nay, even things that
   are not, as if they were mere non-entities, and did not deserve the
   name of men or beings; and indeed, as they see no beauty nor comeliness
   in Christ, it is no wonder that they can see none in the church; but
   these daughters of Jerusalem could, for they judged not according to
   the outward appearance; the world only sees the outside of the people
   of God, which is generally poor, mean, and abject; but these could
   penetrate into the inside of the church, and viewed her, who is the
   king's daughter, as all glorious within, and therefore call her the
   fairest among women; for outwardly she was now black with sins,
   infirmities, reproaches and persecutions; yet notwithstanding she is
   highly esteemed of by them; for they had made Moses" choice, having
   thought it more eligible to suffer affliction with the people of God,
   than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach
   of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt. Young converts,
   as I suppose these daughters were, have generally a great respect for
   old professors, for such that were in Christ before them; these are the
   excellent in the earth, in whom is all their delight; they love to see
   them, and take pleasure in their company and conversation; and indeed,
   as love to the brethren is made an evidence of passing from death to
   life, by the apostle John (1 John 3:14), so it shows itself in young
   converts, as soon as any thing else; for oftentimes, where there is but
   a small knowledge of Christ, and acquaintance with him, there is a
   great deal of love to Christ's people; which was the case of these
   daughters here: also it may he supposed, that they give her this title
   to assure her of the high esteem which they had for her, and that
   opinion which they had of her, that she might not think that they
   designed her any hurt by asking the following question; but rather,
   seeing they had such a value for her, that their design was to do her
   all the service, and, be as assisting to her in her search of her
   beloved as they were able; and no doubt also, but this opinion which
   they had of her, made them listen to, and regard the more what she
   afterwards says of her beloved; for they concluded, that he must be
   some great and extraordinary person, that she, who was the fairest
   among women, had made the object of her choice and love: they took it
   for granted, that one so fair, so wise and prudent as she was, would
   not take notice of any person, nor lavish and throw away her love upon
   every object; and this made them the more forward and eager to put the
   question, which is now to be considered.

   II.The question which they propose to her, is, "What is thy beloved
   more than another beloved?" which is not put in a scornful, disdainful
   or profane way, as Pharaoh said to Moses, when he demanded the
   dismission of the people of Israel, "who is the Lord, that I should
   obey his voice?" or as Rabshakeh to the men of Judah, in that railing,
   profane speech of his, in 2 Kings 18:33-35, the design and sense of
   which was, What is the God of Israel more than the gods of the nations?
   but such was not this question here; these persons were not the profane
   people of the world; they had a great esteem for the church, and
   therefore it cannot be supposed that they would insinuate, my thing in
   a scornful and reproachful way of her beloved: nor did they propose
   this question with a design to ensnare her, as the Scribes and
   Pharisees frequently did to Christ; nor with a design to shift off any
   trouble from themselves, which they might suppose would arise from an
   observance of her solemn charge, but rather are willing to be assisting
   to her all they could; and therefore desire to have some distinguishing
   characters of him, that they might not lose their labor in seeking,
   and, when they found him, might perfectly know him; which when she had
   given, to their entire satisfaction, they then desired to know whither
   he was gone, which way he took when he left her, that they might seek
   him with her, as is manifest from chapter 6:1, nor does this question
   suppose that they were altogether ignorant of her beloved; for though
   their knowledge of Christ was small, yet they were not entirely
   destitute of it; and therefore, as one [651] well observes, they do not
   say, who, but what is thy beloved, etc. and indeed it cannot "be
   reasonably thought, that of him for she had, in chap. they should be
   entirely ignorant of him; for she had, in chapter 1:5, given some
   account of herself to them; that though she was black in herself, yet
   comely in another; which is the reason why they here call her the
   fairest among women; and there is no doubt but she also gave them some
   account of him, from whom she received all her comeliness; and in
   chapter 2:7, and 3:5, she charges them very strictly, to give him, her
   love, no molestation or disturbance; which could not very well be,
   without informing them who he was; and in chapter 3:11, she invites
   them to come forth and see this glorious person, who was her Lord and
   husband, in all his glory, on his coronation and espousal-clay; to
   which invitation, they no doubt complied, and therefore must have some
   knowledge of him. The design then of this question is, that they might
   know him more and better; which also is the desire of every gracious
   soul, even of those who have made the greatest proficiency in the
   knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; the apostle Paul perhaps knew as
   much of Christ as ever any mere man on earth did, and yet he desired to
   know more of him, and the power of his resurrection; for he valued the
   knowledge of him above all things else: these daughters of Jerusalem,
   though they knew but little, were willing to know more of Christ; as
   they had begun to know, they desired to follow on to know him, and make
   a greater improvement in this kind of learning; and being sensible of
   the church's abilities, desire her assistance, and are willing to, be
   instructed by her: also those who knew the most of Christ, are
   frequently desirous of having his praises and excellencies set forth by
   others; for they can never hear him enough extolled; his name to them
   is as ointment poured forth; therefore they love him, as did the
   virgins here; who excited the church hereunto, by putting this
   question, and so had their ends answered: and perhaps likewise they
   might have in view the trial of her faith in Christ, her knowledge of
   him, and love to him in her present state; she was now under his
   resentments; he had withdrawn himself from her, and she was exposed to
   the scandal, reproach, and persecutions of her enemies; and they were
   willing to know how her faith stood now, whether she loved him now as
   well as ever, and whether by his absence she had nor lost all just
   ideas of him; and in this she gives them full satisfaction in her
   answer to them; where she gives an exact account of him, describes him
   from head to foot, and shows the strength of her faith in him, and
   affections for him, particularly in the close of it, verse 16, also in
   this question they seem principally desirous of knowing what those
   excellencies were which were in him, that distinguished him from other
   beloveds, and made him preferable to them: Christ was the chiefest
   among ten thousands in her esteem; to all that believe he is precious;
   not only precious upon an equal foot with others, but far more precious
   than all other things or persons besides; for there is none in heaven,
   nor any upon earth, that saints desire besides him: there are indeed a
   great many other beloveds, but Christ is preferable to them all; and in
   what he is so, the daughters of Jerusalem were willing to know.

   1st, The world, with the riches and grandeur of it, is the beloved of
   some persons. There are too many, both in the world and in the church,
   that have their affections too much set on earthly things; who neglect
   their own souls, and the cause and interest of Christ Jesus; having,
   Demas-like, loved this present world: but, alas! What is this world, or
   any thing in it, to be compared to Christ, the believer's beloved?
   everything, even the best that is in the world, is fading, perishing
   and transitory; many temptations and snares, foolish and hurtful lusts,
   does an immoderate care for, and sinful love of this world, run persons
   into; therefore, says the apostle John (1 John 2:15), "love not the
   world, neither the things that are in the world;" for they are not to
   be mentioned with Christ he is infinitely preferable to them (see Prov.
   3:13-15).

   2dly, The sinful lusts and pleasures of this life are the beloveds of
   others. Every natural man has his beloved lust or lusts; and these he
   idolizes and adores, falls down to and worships; he makes gods of them,
   as the apostle says, Philippians 3:19, of some, "whose god is their
   belly:" and it may be said of all by nature, that they are "serving
   divers lusts and pleasures," being lovers of them; who are never better
   pleased and more satisfied, than when they are "fulfilling the desires
   of the flesh and of the mind;" but these pleasures are but short-lived;
   they afford no real satisfaction now; and, if grace prevent not, will
   end in bitterness and death: wherefore the worst of a believer, even
   his afflictions, are better than these; and therefore he thinks it more
   eligible to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the
   pleasures of sin for a season; and if so, much more preferable must
   Christ, an interest in him, union to him, and communion with him, be to
   all such beloveds as these.

   3dly, The praise and applause of men is another beloved of some
   persons. This was the beloved of the hypocritical Pharisees, who, in
   all the parts of their religion and devotion, sought the honor of men,
   and not of God: as also of those, who, though they were convinced in
   their consciences that Christ was the Messiah, and believed him to be
   so, yet "did not confess him, for they loved the praise of men more
   than the praise of God;" they were afraid that their good names,
   characters and reputations should be blasted, as too many are now: and
   therefore drop the doctrines of the gospel, and desert the cause and
   interest of Christ Jesus: but though "a good name is better than
   precious ointment," it is not better than a precious Jesus, whose "name
   is as ointment poured forth;" nor better than the precious doctrines of
   the gospel; it is much preferable to be nick-named, reproached, and
   vilified with Christ and his gospel, than to have the best name,
   character, and reputation in this world without them; for what will it
   avail a man, "though he hath gained all this, when God taketh away his
   soul?"

   4thly, Near and dear relations are the only beloveds of others, as
   parents, children, etc. They set their affections so much on these,
   that Christ has little or no share in them: now, says Christ, Matthew
   10:37, "he that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of
   me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of
   me:" Christ is preferable to all such beloveds, and indeed to any
   creature-enjoyment whatever.

   5thly, and lastly, Self is the beloved of many; nay, may not I say, too
   much the dearly-beloved of us all? Self lies close to us, is near and
   dear unto us; and we too much deserve that character, "lovers of
   ourselves, more than lovers of God;" and yet Christ requires of us,
   that we should deny this beloved self, sinful self, and part with it
   for him; nay, even righteous self, our beloved righteousness, which we
   are naturally so fond of, and which is so hard and difficult a work to
   do; and yet souls are enabled by divine grace to do this, seeing a
   super-excellency in Christ and his righteousness, as the apostle Paul
   did; who, though he had been so much in love with his own
   righteousness; it had been his darling, he valued himself much upon it,
   and thought to have gained much by it; yet threw it all away as "loss
   and dung," and desired to be found in Christ, and "in his righteousness
   only; that being far preferable to his former beloved.

   Thus Christ excels all other beloveds; and he must needs do so, for, 1.
   He is fairer than all others; there is no such beauty to be found in
   any beloved whatever as is in him; he is the "brightness of his
   Father's glory, and the express image of his person." 2. He is wiser
   than all others; he is a perfection of wisdom, as well as beauty; "in
   him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge." 3. He is richer
   than all others; he is possessed of "unsearchable riches;" riches which
   can never be told over, in time, nor to all eternity; he has riches of
   grace and riches of glory; "yea, durable riches and righteousness." Now
   one, in whom all beauty, wisdom and riches meet, must needs be an
   excellent person, and appear preferable to all beloveds: Christ is such
   an one; he has all the accomplishments and perfections of the divine
   and human nature to make him so.

   Again, the daughters of Jerusalem putting such a question as this to
   the church, shows, (1.) Their regard unto her, and compassion for her:
   the watchmen and keepers of the walls, as soon as ever they found her,
   without asking any question, who she was, where she came from, whither
   she was going, or whom she was seeking; I say, as soon as ever they
   found her, they fall upon her, smite her, wound her, and take away her
   veil from her; but these persons showed more regard and compassion;
   for, being willing to assist her in her present case, if possible, they
   stand conferring with her. (2.) It appears from hence, that these were
   inquiring souls, which discover a work of grace begun in them; for no
   sooner are souls awakened to see their lost state by nature, but they
   are inquiring the way of salvation; and having got some glimmering
   knowledge of Christ, and salvation by him, they inquire still more
   after him, concerning his person, office, and grace; and having some
   impressions of his love on their souls, inquire the nature of a church,
   and the ordinances of Christ therein; they ask their way to Zion with
   their faces thitherward." (3.) It is evident, from the question they
   proposed, that they were docile and teachable: they were willing to be
   instructed; they were not haughty, scornful, and above instruction;
   they did not think that they knew enough of Christ and needed to know
   no more, nor be instructed better; but being conscious of their own
   ignorance, and extremely desirous of being informed better, they put
   this question to her.

   III.This question is repeated by them; which shows the surprise that
   they were in at her solemn charge, and the stir she made about her
   beloved; and concluded from thence, that there must be some peculiar
   excellencies in him, which they had not been made acquainted with yet,
   and therefore repeat the question; as also to manifest their
   seriousness in it, and that they were in good earnest desirous of
   knowing Christ more and better; and likewise it is expressive of their
   importunateness to have a speedy answer from her.

   IV.Here is also that which gave occasion to them to put this question
   to her; and that was her strict and solemn charge in the former verse,
   "that thou dost so charge us;" that is, so awfully and solemnly, so
   seriously and strictly, with so much warmth and vehemence: they were
   eye and ear-witnesses to her sufferings at the hands of the watchmen,
   and to her courage, constancy and undauntedness therein; they saw that
   she was no ways discouraged by what she met with from seeking her
   beloved; but seemed rather by her solemn charge to them to be more warm
   and zealous, serious, diligent, and resolved to go on in search of him;
   and seeing all this, it put them upon inquiring what he was, what
   peculiar excellencies were in him, and what distinguished characters he
   might be known by. Thus the warmth, zeal, and liveliness of some
   Christians have been the means of stirring up and quickening, others to
   their duty; nay, the sufferings of the saints, and their courage and
   boldness therein,, have not only filled beholders with wonder, but have
   put their very enemies upon making inquiry into the religion they had
   suffered for; and to ask, who and what that Christ was, for whom they
   had underwent such severe tortures and punishments; and this has been
   the means of the conversion of thousands; which gave rise to that
   saying, "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church:" and this
   is the gloss of R. Solomon Jarchi on this text, namely: "Thus the
   nations asked the Israelites, What is your God more than all gods, that
   ye are burnt and hanged for him after this manner?" Next follows a
   glorious description of Christ, the church's beloved, in answer to this
   question of the daughters of Jerusalem.

Chapter 5 Verse 10

   My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having, in verse 8 given the daughters of Jerusalem a
   strict and solemn charge, that when they found her beloved, they would
   tell him that she was sick of love, made them, in verse 9 very
   inquisitive after him; being as it were uneasy till they knew what he
   was, and wherein he excelled others; and therefore put this question to
   her, "What is thy beloved more than another beloved?" to which an
   answer is returned by her, in this and the following verses; in which
   she first gives a more general description of him, and then descends to
   particulars. The general description of him is in the words now under
   consideration; in which she describes him,

   I.Positively, in regard to what he was in himself, as to his favor and
   complexion; "my beloved is white and ruddy."

   II.Comparatively, as he may be considered with regard to others; "the
   chiefest among ten thousand."

   I.She describes him by his favor and complexion, "white and ruddy."
   Which some [652] understand of his two natures, human and divine; who
   may be said to be white, as to his divine nature; "the ancient of
   days," the everlasting God, is represented in Daniel 7:9 as being
   clothed with "a garment white as snow, and the hair of his head like
   the pure wool:" the description which John (1 John 1:5), gives of the
   Divine Being, is, that he "is light, and in him is no darkness at all;"
   which is thought [653] to be best represented by this color, which is
   simple, and has no mixture and composition in it. Christ is "the light
   of the world;" he was known by this character to the Old Testament
   saints; he was prophesied of as the great light which should lighten
   the Gentile world; this was owned by old Simeon, witnessed by John, and
   asserted by himself: and then it is thought by these interpreters, that
   he may be said to be red or ruddy, as to his human nature. The first
   man, who was a type of Christ, and "a figure of him that was to come,"
   was called Adam, which signifies red; and perhaps he had his name from
   the Hebrew word hmda adamah, which signifies red earth [654] , out of
   which he was formed, Genesis 2:7, so Christ is called " the last Adam?
   (1 Cor.15:45), because he "took part of the same flesh and blood the
   children" whom he loved, "are partakers of." Now, according to this
   sense of the words, her answer is this; Would you know who and what my
   beloved is, and wherein he excels others? I will tell you, and be it
   known unto you, that he is no mean, common and ordinary person; no, he
   is a glorious and an extraordinary one; his name is alp pele,
   wonderful, a wonder, a miracle; and so is his person; two natures meet
   in him; he is God and man in one person; he is "the great mystery of
   godliness, God manifest in the flesh;" and when you hear this, you will
   cease to wonder why I so charge you, and why I love, value, and esteem
   him above all others.

   Again others [655] understand these words of Christ's human nature
   only; and that he may be said to be white, because of the innocence,
   purity and holiness of his human nature; which was not tainted with
   original sin, as ours is, he not descending from Adam by ordinary
   generation; but was miraculously conceived in the womb of a virgin by
   the power of the Holy Ghost, and therefore it is called "that holy
   thing:" neither was there any sinful action committed by him in all his
   life; but both in nature and practice he was "holy, harmless,
   undefiled, and separate from sinners;" he never sinned in thought, word
   or deed, though he "was made sin for us." Also they suppose, he may be
   said to be red or ruddy, on the account of his sufferings in this
   nature; by reason of which he may be represented, in Isaiah 63:1,2, as
   being "red in his apparel," and as being clothed with "dyed garments;"
   for what with the buffetings and scourgings of his body, the crowning
   his head with thorns, and piercing his hands, feet and side, with the
   nails and spear, the garment of the human nature was like "a vesture
   dipped in blood:" to this purpose is Alcuin's note on the text, which
   is not to be despised; he is white, says he, because without sin; red,
   with the blood of his sufferings; "chosen out of ten thousand," because
   he is the only mediator of God and men. Now there cannot appear a more
   beautiful and delightful sight, to those who desire "to know nothing
   but Christ and him crucified," than to see the just Jesus suffering for
   unjust ones; him that "knew no sin, made sin for them;" and the holy,
   harmless, innocent, and unspotted lamb of God, shedding his blood for
   the vilest of sinners: according to this sense, the church's answer is;
   Would you know what my beloved is, and wherein he excels others? I will
   tell you, he is not lack with original and actual sin, as you and I
   are; for though you see him red with sufferings; yet he was "not cut
   off for himself, but was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised
   for our iniquities;" for in his nature and actions he is white, pure
   and spotless; and such a mixture of white and red, of innocence and
   sufferings, render him extremely amiable and lovely to me. Or else,

   As others [656] have observed, these words may be understood of the
   different administrations of mercy and justice: Thus when Christ
   pardons sinners, "though their sins be as scarlet," he makes them "as
   white as snow; and though they be red like crimson, they become as
   wool;" and when he justifies persons, he is said to clothe them in
   "fine linen, clean and white, which is the righteousness of the
   saints;" and when he promises glorification to them, it is in such
   words as these, "they shall walk with me in white, for they are
   worthy;" and so glorified saints are represented, "clothed with white
   robes, palms in their hands, and hallelujahs in their mouths;" for all
   which see Isaiah 1:18; Revelation 3:4, 5; and 7:9, 13, 14, and 19:8,
   and then when he is represented as taking vengeance on his enemies, and
   executing wrath upon his foes, he is said to be "red in his apparel,"
   and to be "clothed with a vesture dipped in blood;" for so they
   understand Isaiah 63:1,2; Revelation 19:13, and it may be farther
   observed, that the wrath which the Lord poureth forth upon the "wicked
   of the earth," is represented by a cup of red wine, expressing the
   fierceness and fury of it; "for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup,
   and, the wine is red," etc. (Ps.75:8). And this agrees with the common
   notion of the Cabalistic doctors, that when God appears in mercy and
   kindness, then he may be said to be white; but when in wrath and anger,
   red: of this frequent mention is made in Zohar, and in other Cabalistic
   books: [657] according to this sense, it is as if she should say, My
   beloved has mercy and grace for his people, which he bestows in a
   sovereign manner upon them; and he has vengeance for his adversaries,
   which he executes upon them according to the strictest rules of
   justice; and this mixture of mercy and justice, of white and red,
   renders him an extraordinary person; it makes some to love him, and
   others to fear him. Or else,

   These words may be interpreted of Christ's battles and victories, and
   may represent him as a mighty warrior, and a triumphant conqueror: Thus
   in Revelation 6:4. the warrior, who had "power given him to take peace
   from the earth," is introduced as riding upon "a red horse;" and in
   verse 2, he that "went forth conquering and to conquer," as riding upon
   a "white horse;" thus Christ, who is "the Lord of hosts, the man of
   war," considered as fighting the Lord's battles, may be said to be red
   or ruddy; and as returning from the field of battle, as a mighty
   conqueror, having "spoiled principalities and powers," and got an
   entire victory over all his and our enemies, may be said to be white.
   And now this great person, as if she should say, has done all this for
   me, and "made me also more than a conqueror;" and this person is my
   beloved.

   But passing these several senses, which perhaps may be thought too nice
   and curious, though agreeable to the analogy of faith, yet it may be,
   will not bear so well here; though I choose rather to understand them
   of the beauty, glory and excellency of Christ, as mediator, without
   applying particularly these colors of "white and ruddy," to either
   nature, or to any particular actions performed in either: and I cannot
   but think that the church, in this description of Christ, has some
   reference to the account that is given of David, 1 Samuel 16:12. which
   is, that "he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and
   goodly to look at." David was an eminent type of Christ; of his line
   the Messiah came, who is sometimes called David in scripture; and is
   both his "root and offspring, the bright and the morning star;" and as
   described by David, is "fairer than the children of men," being "white
   and ruddy, which discovers the best temperature, the most healthful
   constitution, and the completest beauty: as mediator, he is a
   perfection of beauty; all divine perfections are in him; the glory of
   them all shine resplendently in his face or person; and they are all
   glorified in him and by him, who is "the brightness of his Father's
   glory, and the express image of his person." There is also a
   mediatorial glory that he is possessed of, which is the result and
   consequence of his work; and which readers him exceeding fair and
   beautiful in the eyes of believers now, and is what they will, with
   wonder and pleasure, everlastingly gaze upon in another world: likewise
   as mediator, all fullness of grace dwells in him; and as "full of grace
   and truth, his glory appears as the glory of the only begotten of the
   Father."

   Again, Christ, as mediator, is "white and ruddy," a perfection of
   beauty in the eyes of believers, as considered in all his offices of
   prophet, priest and king; and in all his relations, as husband, father,
   brother and friend, which he bears and stands in to his people:
   moreover, he is exceeding beautiful in their esteem, in all that he has
   done and suffered for them; but of this beauty and fairness o£ Christ,
   see more on chapter 1:15.

   II.Christ is here described by the church comparatively, as he may be
   considered with regard to others; "the chiefest among ten thousand."

   The Septuagint render the words thus, "chosen out of, or from ten
   thousand:" [658] so Christ is both by God and men; he is chosen of God
   from among ten thousand, as man and mediator: when that large number of
   all the individuals of human nature, which tie resolved to create in
   time, came up in his vast and eternal mind; a certain number of them he
   for himself whom he meant to make instances of singled out his mighty
   grace and mercy, and therefore ordained them to life and salvation; and
   out of this select company, which he had in his eternal view, he chose
   the man Christ Jesus, and singled oat that single individuum of human
   nature only, to be united to the eternal logov, logos, the second
   person in the glorious Trinity; and therefore he is said to "exalt one
   chosen out of the people:" he chose this glorious person to be the
   Savior. head, and mediator of his elect ones, that living stone, which
   is disallowed and rejected by some men, who would be accounted
   builders, is "chosen of God, and precious;" he has laid him as the
   foundation, and "made him as the head of the corner;" he knew that he
   was furnished with suitable abilities to be the sinner, savior,
   therefore he "laid help upon one that is mighty;" he called him to the
   work, invested him with the office of a mediator, and appointed him his
   "salvation to the ends of the earth:" and now, had all human beings
   been summoned together to have chosen a savior for themselves, they
   could never have made a better choice than God has made for them; with
   this choice every sensible sinner is well satisfied, and rejoices in
   it; and was it to be done again, would say, as the Psalmist did, "He
   shall choose our inheritance for us," (Ps. 47:4).

   He is also chosen of men from among ten thousand: there is none among
   all the angels in heaven, the large number of inhabitants that fill the
   upper world; nor any among the vast crowds of the sons of men, so
   desirable to sensible sinners as he is: they make choice of Him only
   for their Savior i far being sensible that in vain is salvation hoped
   for any where else, they say of all the works of their hands, even of
   the best their hands ever wrought, "ye shall not save us;" neither will
   we any more give you such honor, nor have such a dependence on you as
   to say, "ye are our gods," but Christ, and he only, shall be our
   salvation; and though he slay us, yet will we trust in him: they choose
   him for their ruler and governor, their Lord and King; and though they
   have formerly been under, and have submitted to the government of
   others; yet they now desire to be his subjects and servants only, and
   to be obedient to his laws and commands: they likewise fix on him as
   the alone object of their love, whom they have the strongest affection
   for, and desirous to keep the most inviolable chastity to; for though
   he is out of sight, he is not out of mind, "whom having not seen they
   love;" nor can he be out-rivaled by any, being preferable in their
   esteem to all others.

   Moreover the Hebrew word may be rendered, a "standard-bearer [659] , or
   one standard among ten thousand." The church of Christ here below is in
   a militant state; she has many enemies to grapple with, which cause
   fightings without, and fears within; and though these enemies are
   mighty and powerful, crafty and cunning, yet in the name and strength
   of her Lord, she sets up her banners, and appears as terrible to them,
   and as majestic to others, "as an army with banners;" and this banner,
   or standard, which is both her covering and her comfort in the day of
   battle, is love, according to chapter 2:4. It is the love of Christ, as
   a banner displayed, an ensign set up, and standard erected, which
   invites and engages so many to enlist themselves in Christ's service;
   and, when enlisted, animates them to fight the Lord's battles so
   courageously as they do; Christ, he is the standard-bearer, and the
   great "captain of our salvation," being by God the Father given as a
   "leader and commander" to the people. Now Christ being said to be "the
   standard-bearer among ten thousands" may be understood of the
   multitude, either of ministering angels [660] , who are under him and
   at his command; or of saints, who are enlisted in his service, and
   ready to do his pleasure; he having set up his standard, and being
   himself "an ensign to the people," multitudes flock unto him, and
   fulfill the prophecy of him, as the great Shiloh, to whom "the
   gathering of the people should be:" herein lies the glory and
   excellency of Christ that he has ten thousand, that is, a large number
   of choice and select ones under his standard, such as there are not the
   like in all the world besides; and how stately and majestic does Christ
   look, and what a noble sight is it to see him bearing the standard
   before such a company! such a sight as this John had of him, at the
   head of a vast multitude of those shining ones, who were "clothed with
   white robes," and had "palms in their hands," having just obtained a
   glorious victory over their enemies (Rev. 7:9, 13, 14). Or else, the
   intent of the word is, that Christ is a more excellent standard-bearer
   than all others [661] : there may be ten thousand persons who carry a
   flag, but none of them all are to be compared with him, either for
   comeliness, strength or courage; none have such a choice and select
   company under them as he has; neither do any carry such a banner as he
   does, whose motto is love; and herein was he, who is "the lion of the
   tribe of Judah," represented by that tribe, which of all the tribes of
   Israel pitched their standard first, and had the greatest number under
   it (see Num. 2:3, 4).

   But these words by our translators are rendered, "the chiefest among
   ten thousand;" and the sense of them is no ways opposed by the former
   versions; for if he is "chosen out of," and is "the standard-bearer
   among ten thousand," then he must be the chiefest among them; he is the
   chiefest among all the angels in heaven; for to "which of the angels
   said he at any time, Thou art my son," etc. He is the Son of God in a
   higher sense than angels and men are; angels are the sons of God by
   creation, saints by adoption, but Christ is the Son of God by an
   ineffable generation; as he is God, he is the creator of angels, and to
   him they pay homage and adoration; they are his servants, and are at
   his command, whom he sends forth as ministering spirits, to do his
   pleasure; and though as man, in the state of his humiliation and
   abasement here on earth in the days of his flesh, he was "made a little
   lower than the angels;" yet now in the very same nature in which he was
   abased below them, he is now exalted above them at the Father's right
   hand; for "to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right
   hand," etc. as mediator, he has "obtained a more excellent name than
   they;" for the name of a savior or mediator is given to none of them;
   and as such they are beholden to him, though not to make peace and
   reconciliation for them, they having never sinned and incurred the
   divine displeasure; yet they are obliged unto him for confirming grace,
   to secure them in that state in which they stand. He is also the
   chiefest of all on earth, as well as of all in heaven; in all things,
   and over all persons, he has the preeminence; he is the head of saints,
   their "everlasting father," and tender husband; he is the great master
   of the family, and "the first-born among many brethren;" he is the King
   of saints, and Lord of the creation; and should be the chiefest, and
   have the chiefest place in the desires of our hearts, in the
   contemplations of our minds, the affections of our souls, and in our
   ascriptions of glory; for "he is the chiefest among ten thousand."

Chapter 5 Verse 11

   His head is as the most fine gold; his locks are bushy,
   and black as a raven:
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church, having given a general description of her beloved in
   the former verse, pursuant to the request of the daughters of
   Jerusalem, does in this enter into a more particular commendation of
   him, and continues unto the end of the chapter: which commendation
   consists of ten particulars, two of which are in these words;

   I.She describes him by his head; which, she says, "is as the most fine
   gold."

   II.By his locks; which "are bushy, and black as a raven."

   I.She describes "his head as the most fine gold." Some think, that some
   ornament of the head is meant, as a diadem or crown of gold: or else,
   the hair of the head; which though afterwards is said to be black, yet,
   being powdered with gold dust, looked of the color of gold, especially
   with the rays of the sun upon it; as did the hair of Solomon's youths
   that attended him, being thus decorated, as Josephus [662] relates; and
   which custom of powdering the hair with gold, was used by some of the
   Roman emperor. [663] By Christ's head may be meant, either,

   1st, God the Father, who is in scripture called so: Thus the apostle
   says, in 1 Corinthians 11:3. "The head of every man is Christ, and the
   head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God," that is,
   God the Father; which is to be understood of Christ as man and
   mediator; for as he is Gods the Father is not his head; he is not above
   him, nor superior to him in nature, power or glory; for "being in the
   form of God, he thought it no robbery to be equal with him." It is
   true, the Father is the first person in the Trinity; but he is not
   first in order of time, dignity, nor causality; some of the fathers and
   schoolmen have indeed said, that the Father, with respect to the other
   two persons, is fons deitatis, principium, causa, the fountain of the
   deity, beginning, and cause thereof; these phrases are better let alone
   than used: but he may very properly be said to be the head of Christ,
   as man and mediator; for as he is man, he is God's creature, the work
   of his hands, "a body hast thou prepared me;" and so subject to him,
   and under his power and government; and in this sense ,re those words
   of Christ to be understood, where he says (John 14:28), "My Father is
   greater than I;" being his Creator, Lord, and head. And, 1. Christ as
   man and mediator, has his life from his Father; as he is God, his life
   is original and underived; it is not communicated to him from another;
   but his life, as man and mediator, is given him; he asked life of his
   Father, in the everlasting covenant, both for himself and for his
   people, and it was granted to him; and in this sense is that text to be
   understood (John 5:26). "As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he
   given to the Son to have life in himself:" as we derive our life from
   Christ, and have it maintained and supported by him; so Christ, as man
   and mediator, has his life from his Father, by whom also it is
   supported, he lives by him; "as the living Father hath sent me," says
   Christ (John 6:57), "and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me
   shall live by me;" and in this sense is God the head of Christ; he
   communicates life unto him, as man and mediator, and continues it in
   him. 2. Christ, as man and mediator, is subject to his Father, as the
   members of the body are to the head: thus, as God's "righteous
   servant," he was sent by him about the great work of man's redemption,
   was obedient to him, and carefully observed all the commands which he
   enjoined him; he still is, and will be to all eternity subject to his
   Father, as man and mediator; for when all things shall be put under the
   feet of Christ, as King of saints, then he, "the Son shall be subject
   to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all," (1
   Cor. 15:28). 3. Christ, as man and mediator, was guided and directed,
   taught and instructed by his Father, what he should speak and what he
   should do, as the great prophet in Israel, and Savior of the would; and
   this gives light to those scriptures, John 5:20 and 8:28 and 12:49, 50,
   and proves the Father to be the head of Christ. 4. Christ, as man and
   mediator, was strengthened and supported in his work by his Father, as
   his head; this was promised him in the everlasting covenant; and was
   made good to him "in an acceptable," suitable and seasonable "time, in
   the day of salvation;" in the day he wrought out the salvation of
   sinners; which animated and encouraged him in the view of all that he
   was to go through (see Isa. 1:8)--to and proved him to be the "Son of
   man," whom God made strong for himself. Now this head of Christ "is as
   the most fine gold;" here are two words used in the Hebrew text, which
   both signify gold; [664] the one signifies pure, fine and shining; the
   other, strong and solid gold; and may also be rendered. the gold of
   Fez; [665] from whence either the city of Fez had its name; [666] or
   else, this gold had its name from the land where it was in abundance;
   and perhaps is the same with the gold of Uphaz, mentioned in Daniel
   10:5; Jeremiah 10:9; and this being the best and finest gold, the
   church uses it to set off the glory and excellency of Christ's head:
   not that we are to suppose, as the apostle observes, Acts 17:29, that
   "the Godhead is like to gold and silver," etc. for no likeness and
   similitude can be formed of the Divine Being; and indeed the church
   seems to be almost at a loss what to compare this head to; but gold
   being the richest, most excellent, and durable metal, and the gold of
   Fez the best of any, she uses this to set forth the glory of it by: and
   yet, as not being satisfied, she says, it is as "the most fine gold;"
   if there is any better, it is like that; or, as the words may also be
   rendered, " his head is as the gold of gold; [667] and it is as if she
   should say, I would compare it to gold, because I can think of nothing
   better, richer, and more glorious; but I cannot find gold good enough
   to compare to it; this is "the gold of gold;" there is none such
   elsewhere; the whole universe cannot furnish us with the like; he that
   is my beloved's head, is "more glorious and excellent than the
   mountains of prey;" yea, than all the golden mountains of Peru. Or
   else,

   2dly, By Christ's. head may be meant, the divine nature in him, [668]
   which is the head, the chief and principal nature in Christ; in which
   his highest characters are wrote, and which puts a glory and efficacy
   in all that he has done and suffered as mediator; and it is this which
   supported him, and enabled him to go through the great work of man's
   salvation: all divine perfections are in Christ, and these all shine
   resplendently in him, who is "the brightness of his Father's glory, and
   the express image of his person;" this head is an head of pure, fine
   and shining gold; "all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in
   him;" and the glory of it is very manifest and conspicuous, Or,

   3dly, By Christ's head may be meant, his headship over his church, or
   his regal power and government, which I rather incline to; thus he is
   represented, in Psalm 21:3 as having "a crown of pure gold" upon his
   head, denoting his royal dignity and authority: so Nebuchadnezzar, or
   the large and flourishing monarchy which he was ruler of, is set forth
   by an head of gold, in Daniel 2:32-37,38. And now Christ, as Lord of
   the church, and King of saints, may be compared to "the most fine
   gold," because his kingdom and government is the most excellent and
   glorious; it is managed with the utmost wisdom and prudence, and
   according to the strictest rules of justice and equity; his head is a
   golden one, and fit for the work he is called to, for in it "are hid
   all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge;" and therefore he is the
   only wise and just, as well as the only rich and powerful potentate in
   the universe; he is "King of kings, and Lord of lords;" all others
   receive their crowns and kingdoms from him, and are set up and put down
   by him at pleasure; and therefore it is by him that "kings reign, and
   princes decree justice;" all the wisdom and prudence, justice and
   equity, which appear in any of the governments of this world, are but
   faint resemblances of what of this nature appear in Christ's
   government; he is the "head of gold," all the rest are but like "brass,
   iron and clay." 2. He is compared to fine gold, because his kingdom is
   pure and spiritual; at is "not of this world;" it consists in nothing
   that is worldly, earthly and carnal; it is "not meat and drink, but
   righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost." 3. Because, like gold,
   it is solid and substantial; it does not consist in external pomp and
   gaudy shows, as the kingdoms of this world, which yet are tiding,
   transitory, and perishing; but this, though it does not come with
   observation, but looks mean and abject in its outward appearance; yet
   is all of pure and solid gold, and will appear bright and glorious,
   when the gild of others is worn off and gone. 4. It is compared to the
   most fine gold for the richness of it: Christ is the richest prince in
   the world; his riches are lasting and durable; they are unsearchable
   and incomprehensible; his kingdom is the richest on earth, and the
   meanest subject in it is a prince, nay, a king; that may be much more
   truly said of Christ's subjects, what the proud Assyrian monarch said
   boastingly of his princes, "Are not my princes altogether kings?"
   Christ's meanest subjects are so; for he has made them "kings and
   priests unto God?" (Rev. 1:6). 5. Christ's kingdom may be compared to
   gold, because it is lasting and durable: Christ's "throne is for ever
   and ever?" there will never be any end of his government; nor of the
   increase of it, and of the peace and prosperity thereof; when all other
   kingdoms are destroyed, and all other rule, power and authority put
   down, Christ's kingdom will stand; it wilt be more visibly set up, and
   appear more glorious, and so continue for ever. Thus Christ, as head of
   the church, and king of saints, may be compared to the most fine gold;
   which is the first particular she instances in, by which he may be
   known from others. The Jewish writers, [669] by this head of fine gold,
   understand the law, which is more to be desired than gold; as they do
   by the locks in the following clause, the several letters, sections,
   doctrines and senses of it.

   II.She describes him by his locks, which, she says, "are bushy and
   black as a raven." By his locks may be meant, either,

   1st, The thoughts, [670] counsels and purposes of God, who is the head
   of Christi which, 1. Like the hairs of a man's head are innumerable:
   the purposes of his heart concerning man's salvation; his thoughts of
   love, grace, and mercy towards sinners, "cannot be reckoned up in order
   to him; they are more than can be numbered; the sum of them is so
   great," that they exceed the sand upon the sea-shore. 2. Like bushy and
   black locks, are intricate, dark and obscure, unsearchable and
   incomprehensible; God's thoughts and purposes of distinguishing grace
   are out of our reach, and beyond our comprehension; and therefore are
   said to be "higher than our thoughts, even as the heavens are higher
   than the earth:" when we seriously consider that the great and infinite
   Being should pitch his thoughts of love from all eternity upon poor,
   sinful creatures; and upon some, and not all; and resolve on their
   everlasting salvation, and not on others; it obliges us to say, with
   the apostle, "O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and
   knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past
   finding out!" Romans 11:33. 3. Yet these thoughts and purposes of God's
   heart, so Jar as they are made known to us, are like bushy and black
   locks of hair, very beautiful and delightful: How glorious and
   beautiful is the draught, the model and scheme of salvation, which was
   drawn in the eternal mind? with what exactness is it managed? what
   wisdom and grace appear in that "fellowship of the mystery," which the
   gospel leads us into an acquaintance with? "How precious are those
   thoughts of love which run through all, as well as " how great is the
   sum of them?" Or,

   2dly, By these locks may be meant, the multitude of believers, [671]
   which grow upon Christ, as the head of the church and these may be
   compared to hair for their number, their dependence on Christ, and
   their reception of life and nourishment from him, as has been observed
   on chapter 4:1 and these being called locks of hair, may intend their
   being congregated in gospel-order, their being united in faith and
   love, and their walking together in all the ordinances of Christ;
   "endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace." Now
   saints being thus joined together in holy fellowship, having strict
   regard to Christ's truths and commands, do much adorn the head, Christ
   Jesus; and are a lovely and delightful sight to spectators; see
   Colossians 2:5. And these locks are said to be, 1. Bushy; the word may
   signify heaps; [672] and so denotes the multitude of believers that
   spring from, and have their dependence on Christ, the head: or it may
   be rendered, thick, [673] being well-set; or pendulous, [674] hanging
   down in a beautiful order: and this may intend the ornament that
   believers are to Christ; "childrens" children are the crown of old
   men;" believers are "a crown of glory to Christ;" they are "a royal
   diadem in his hand," and upon his head: or it may be translated, crisp
   or curled; [675] and so be expressive of the hardness and strength of
   believers; curled hair [676] being the strongest and hardest: believers
   though weak in themselves, yet are strong in Christ; not only to
   perform duty, but to withstand enemies, and endure hardness as good
   soldiers of Christ Jesus; they are "strengthened with all might in the
   inner man," to fight the Lord's battles, are undaunted in their
   spirits, and immoveable as a rock. 2. They are said to be "black as a
   raven;" saints are black with original and actual sin, as they are also
   with infirmities, reproaches, scandal and persecution; they have mean
   thoughts of themselves; and though exalted on the head, Christ, yet
   look upon themselves as the least of saints, and chief of sinners:
   though I rather think, this does not intend their blackness by sins,
   infirmities, etc. nor their humble thoughts of themselves; but rather,
   their real beauty, which they have from Christ, and that ornament and
   glory which they are unto him. Or else,

   3dly, By these locks may be meant, Christ's administrations in the
   discharge of his kingly office: and this seems to me to be the best
   sense; for, as by his head, is intended his regal power and government;
   so by his locks, the administrations of it; which though sometimes
   dark, intricate and obscure, being attended with severity to his
   enemies, and so may be said to be bushy and black; yet being managed
   with the utmost wisdom and prudence, and according to the strictest
   rules of justice and equity, look very beautiful and comely, and are
   admired and; wondered at by all the saints (see Rev. 15:3, 4).

   Moreover in general these bushy and black locks of Christ may denote,
   1. The fullness of wisdom which is in Christ; curled hair is a sign of
   an hot and dry brain, [677] which produces acuteness and sharpness of
   wit: all wisdom is in Christ; he is the wisdom of God; who has not only
   fullness of it for himself, which is requisite to qualify him for, and
   carry him through the work he is engaged in; but has also a fullness of
   it: for the saints, to whom "he is made of God wisdom as well as
   righteousness." 2. His youthful strength, vigor and courage, of which
   his black hair is accounted a sign: in Revelation 1:14. Christ's hair
   is said to be "as white as wool, as white as snow," to denote his
   senile gravity; that he is "the ancient of days; who exists from
   everlasting to everlasting:" but here his locks are said to be black,
   to set forth his juvenile vigor and strength, which is always in its
   bloom, without any change or alteration: he is the mighty God in his
   highest nature, and "mighty to save," as mediator; he gave the fullest
   proofs of his strength and courage in fulfilling all the law required,
   in bearing all that justice inflicted, and in conquering all his and
   our enemies. 3. These black locks set forth the beauty of Christ: black
   hair was accounted the most beautiful, not only by the Jews but by the
   Romans; as is manifest from what is said by many of the poets, [678]
   concerning both men and women: it was very desirable to them; insomuch
   that these, whose hair was not naturally black, used various ways and
   methods to make it so, and among other things, both Pliny [679] and
   Ælianus [680] tell us, they used the eggs, brains, and blood of ravens
   for that purpose. Now when Christ's locks are said to be black as a
   raven, the meaning is, that he looks exceeding beautiful, being "fairer
   than Absalom," or any of the children of men; his black shining locks,
   hanging down in a beautiful order from his head of gold, make him look
   very stately and majestic; and as the blackness of the raven is a very
   fine black, and what is natural to it, and not made by art; so the
   beauty of Christ is exceeding great, it is natural to him; it is not
   derived from another, as ours is from him, but what is original,
   underived and essential to him; and this proves him to be the most
   excellent beloved, and "the chiefest among ten thousand."

Chapter 5 Verse 12

   His eyes are as the eyes of doves, by the rivers of water,
   washed with milk, and fitly set.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word is the third instance of Christ's beauty, or distinguishing
   character of him, which the church gives to the daughters of Jerusalem,
   whereby they might know him from others; having described him by his
   head and hair, she here describes him by his eyes; the order and method
   in which she proceeds is very just and natural. By his eyes may be
   meant, either,

   First, The gifts and graces of the Spirit which are in Christ. as man
   and mediator; [681] who is represented, in Revelation 5:6 as a lamb
   that had been slain for the sins of men, with even eyes, which are said
   to be "the seven spirits of God;" not that there are seven-personal,
   distinct, divine subsistencies, which are called so; but the phrase
   intends that variety, fullness and perfection of the gifts and grace of
   that one Spirit of God, who is the third person in the blessed Trinity;
   which gifts and grace of his, being bestowed on Christ, as man and
   mediator, furnished and qualified him for his work; of which seven
   spirits or various gifts of the Spirit, which he received for this
   purpose, you may read in Isaiah 11:2-4. Now these may be said to be "as
   the eyes of doves by the rivers of water;" because the Spirit of God
   did in an eminent and public manner descend upon him, as a dove, at the
   time of his baptism in the river of Jordan: and they may also be said
   to be as doves, or as the eyes of doves "washed with milk, to express
   the purity and holiness of his nature, sanctified thereby; for, as man
   and mediator, he was holy harmless, undefiled, and separate from
   sinners: likewise they may be said to be as the eyes of doves fitly
   set, or set in fullness, because the Spirit was not given to him by
   measure, but in fullness; the whole fullness of the gifts and grace of
   the Spirit is given to him; and therefore he appears "full of grace and
   truth," and from hence they are communicated unto men. Or else,

   Secondly, By his eves may be meant the church's teachers, [682] or
   ministers of the gospel; who, as they are the mouth by whom Christ
   speaks, so they are his eyes, by whom he sees, provides for, and
   watches over his church and people; and therefore are called watchmen,
   whose business is to watch for, and over the souls of men: these are
   the eyes which give light unto, guide and direct the members of
   Christ's body; who-point out unto them the way of salvation, and guide
   their feet into the way of peace. Now these may be said to be as the
   eyes of doves, on the account of those dove-like gifts of the Spirit,
   by which they are fitted for their work, and made able ministers of the
   New Testament; also for their honesty, faithfulness, and simplicity in
   preaching the everlasting gospel; and likewise for that harmlessness
   and innocence, which do and ought to appear in their lives and
   conversations. These may also be said to be as doves, or as the eves of
   doves by the rivers of water, which may intend the scriptures of truth;
   [683] for as doves delight to sit by rivers of water, so do the
   ministers of the gospel delight to be reading of, and meditating upon
   the scriptures, which is their work and business: and from hence they
   fetch the doctrines they preach to others; they speak according to the
   oracles of God; and that "not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth,
   but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
   spiritual," 1 Corinthians 2:13. Likewise they may be said to be as
   doves, or as the eyes of doves washed with milk, because of their light
   and knowledge in the gospel, which is the sincere milk of the word;
   whereby they are made capable of feeding others with the plain and
   wholesome truths of the gospel: or else this phrase may intend that
   pure and spotless conversation, which they ought to lead as examples to
   others in faith and purity. Whey may also be said to be tidy set; "for
   God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets,
   thirdly" teachers," etc., 1 Corinthians 12:28, this was the fit and
   beautiful order in which the first ministers of the gospel were placed
   by God himself; and indeed all the ministers of it are fitly set in the
   more eminent part of the body, the church, to overlook, direct, and be
   useful to the several members of it. But these seem rather to be the
   eyes of the church, than the eyes of Christ, which also are compared to
   dove's eyes in chapter 1:15.

   Thirdly, To understand by these eyes, the omniscience of Christ: R.
   Aben Ezra seems to understand them of God's omniscience; for his
   comment is that text in Proverbs 16:3. The eyes of the Lord are in
   every place. Christ is the omniscient God; every creature is made
   manifest in his sight; all things are naked and open unto the eyes of
   him with whom we have to do; who is the living word, and a critical
   discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart: in the days of his
   flesh here on earth, he needed not that any should testify of man; for
   he knew what was in man; and gave convincing proofs to the Scribes and
   Pharisees, that he was well acquainted with the secret thoughts of
   their hearts: Peter bore a noble testimony to Christ's omniscience,
   when he appealed to him, saying, "Lord, thou knowest all things, thou
   knowest that I love thee." And indeed was he not the omniscient God,
   how could he be capable of acting as the head of his church, or as the
   mediator between God and man, or of judging the world at the last day?
   but then he will give an incontestable proof of this divine
   perfection's being in him; he will let all the churches, and all the
   world know, that he it is which searcheth the reins and hearts. Now
   when these eyes of Christ's omniscience are fixed on persons in a way
   of wrath and anger, they are said to be as flames of fire; especially
   when fixed upon heretics, idolators, false worshippers, or any of his
   and his church's enemies (see Rev. 1:14, 2:18, 20-23, 19:11, 12, 15);
   but when they are fixed in a way of special love and grace upon his own
   people, they may be said to be,

   1st, As the eye of doves, which are loving, lovely, clear and chaste,
   1. Christ's eyes may be said to be as doves, because of the lovingness
   of them; the eyes of doves are not fierce and furious, as the eyes of
   some creatures are; there are no fury in Christ's eyes, as fixed upon
   his people: "The eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them
   that hope in his mercy;" that is, his eye is upon poor trembling
   sinners, who come to the throne of grace, and prostrate themselves at
   his feet, humbly imploring his grace and mercy, and venturing on him as
   sinners ready to perish; his eye is upon them all the while; not to
   destroy them, and cut them off from his sight; but to deliver their
   soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine: his eyes are upon
   all his righteous ones; not to cut off the remembrance of them from the
   earth, which he threatens to the wicked, but to deliver them out of all
   their troubles: his eyes are upon all creatures, and all things, for
   they run to and fro throughout the whole earth; but then it is to show
   himself strong in the behalf of them, whose heart is perfect towards
   him: his eye of love is always upon his people, to succor, relieve,
   protect, and defend them: his eye is upon them under all their trials,
   temptations, desertions, sorrows and afflictions: his eye is upon them
   when in the furnace, to observe the exercise of their grace upon him,
   their carriage to him; and when tried, to deliver out of it; for his
   eyes behold, and his eye-lids try the children of men, 2. They may be
   compared to dove's eyes, because they are lovely, as well as loving;
   and it is for this reason he compares the church's eyes to doves, in
   chapter 1:15 and 4:1. Every part of this description serves to set off
   the beauty and loveliness of Christ's eyes; they are said to be "as the
   eyes of doves by the rivers of water," because doves delight to sit
   there; where being pleased with the pure and purling streams, their
   eyes look more quick and lively, and so more beautiful and lovely. Also
   they are said to be as doves washed with milk; either as milk-white
   doves, which look very pleasant and delightful; or as doves washing
   themselves in streams of water, look as clean as if they had been
   washed in milk: likewise they are said to be as the eyes of doves fitly
   set; that is, neither too much staring out, [684] nor too much sunk
   within; neither hollow-eyed nor goggle-eyed, which are both extreme
   deformities in the eye. 3. They may be compared to doves eyes, because
   of their clearness and perspicuity; Christ's eyes are so clear, he is
   so sharp-sighted, that he can see all persons, and things in all
   places, at one view; for "the eyes of the Lord are in every place,
   beholding the evil and the good:" more especially his eyes behold, and
   he takes cognizance of his own people; these he knows by name, and
   distinguishes them in his care and affections from all others; he sees
   and knows all their wants perfectly well, is able to supply them, and
   has an heart to do it; and seeing that "all things are naked and open
   unto him, with whom they have to do at the throne of grace," they are
   encouraged to come thither with the greater Boldness; he sees and knows
   all the contrivances and designs of wicked men against his people,
   though formed in the dark; for the darkness and the light are both
   alike to him; his eyes are so clear, sharp and penetrating, that there
   is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may
   hide themselves: and this makes much for the comfort of his people, as
   well as serves to command and set off the loveliness and excellency of
   him. 4. They may be compared to doves eyes for their faithfulness and
   chastity: Christ is faithful to God, who appointed him to be the
   mediator and savior of his people; and to that covenant of grace which
   he made with him; in which he promised many things, which are fully
   performed by him; and he received many blessings of grace for his
   people, which he is faithful to distribute unto them and bestow upon
   them he hath given meat to them that fear him, as an indication that
   his eye is upon, and that he will ever be mindful of his covenant; he
   has a respect unto it, and therefore calls those by his grace, and
   brings them to glory, who are interested in it: also as the eye of the
   dove is only upon its own mate, is faithful and chaste unto it, and has
   no regard to another; so Christ's eye of love is only upon his church;
   as she is his dove, so she is his only one: hence he says, "my dove, my
   undefiled is but one;" and as he loves her above all others, so he
   loves none but her with his special and peculiar love, in Which he
   always rests and continues.

   2dly, Christ's eyes of love, as fixed on his own people, are as the
   eves of doves by the rivers of water. Now this sets forth the
   loveliness and beauty of Christ's eyes, as has been already observed;
   the eyes of doves being more brisk, quick and lively, when sitting by
   rivers of water, where they are delighted in and pleased with the clear
   and running streams thereof: and may also lead us to observe these two
   things; 1. The fixedness and constancy of Christ's eye of love being
   set upon his own people: doves sitting by a river side, keep their eyes
   fixed upon the purling streams; and in drinking, as Pliny [685]
   observes, do not resupinare colla, erect their necks, and lift up their
   heads, but keeping their eyes fixed upon the water, drink a large
   draught of it in the manner of beasts: Christ, being sweetly delighted
   with his own people, has fixed his eye upon them. and never removes it
   from them; he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous; his eye was
   upon them before time, continues so in time, and will be so to all
   eternity; for having loved his own which were in the world, he loved
   them to the end, 2. It may intend the object of Christ's love: some of
   the Jewish writers, [686] by the rivers of water, would have their
   schools and synagogues intended; where the waters of the law flow, the
   difficulties of it are explained, and its proper senses given: but they
   may be much better understood of gospel- churches, made up of righteous
   persons; who are justified by Christ's righteousness; sanctified by his
   grace; sprinkled with the clean water of the everlasting covenant; and
   who have low, mean, and humble thoughts of themselves; on such as these
   Christ's eye is fixed, and to these he looks (see Isa. 66:2), here the
   ordinances of the gospel are administered in their purity, the waters
   of the sanctuary flow, the doctrines of grace are powerfully preached,
   and souls hereby much delighted and refreshed.

   3dly, These eyes of Christ are said to be as the eyes of doves washed
   with milk; and this is expressive both of the beauty and clearness of
   them, as has been already observed: eyes, when washed, are clearest,
   and so most lovely; like milk-white doves, which look the most
   beautiful, especially when they have just washed themselves: respect
   may be had to the color of doves; white doves were had in esteem in
   Palestine and Syria. [687] And this may also intend the purity of
   Christ's eyes, who is of purer eyes than to behold evil, with any
   pleasure or approbation; and likewise the meekness and mildness of
   them: his eyes are not red and furious, but look as if they had been
   washed with milk, being full of mercy, pity and compassion to poor
   sinners; his heart is full of it, and his actions, as God-man and
   mediator, give the strongest proofs of his being a merciful as well as
   a faithful high priest,

   4thly, These eyes are said to be fitly set, or fitting by fullness;
   [688] that is, by full channels of water. Christ himself is as rivers
   of waters, which denote the fullness and abundance of grace that is in
   him; and by these full fountains of grace, life and salvation, he sits,
   dwells and abides; and thither he, the lamb in the midst of the
   throne," leads his people. Or the words may be rendered, "sitting in
   fullness;" [689] and so it expresses the loveliness and beauty of
   Christ's eyes, as has been already observed: his eyes were neither sunk
   too low within, nor stood too much out, but exactly filled their holes;
   they were fitly set as diamonds in a ring, or as precious stones in the
   breast-plate of the high-priest, which exactly filled the cavities
   which were made for them, and therefore were called stones of fullness
   (see Ex. 25:7, 28:17, 20); so R. Solomon Jarchi and R. Aben Ezra
   understand the words; tho' they may be better translated, "sitting upon
   fullness". [690] Christ's eyes are set or sitting, 1. Upon the fullness
   of this world; "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it;" as he
   has a right unto it, so his eyes are upon it; for "his eyes run to and
   fro throughout the whole earth;" they are an every place at one and the
   same time, beholding at one view the evil and the good, all their
   persons, and all their actions; his eye is upon that vast number of
   persons and things that fill the whole universe, and upon the large
   variety of actions performed there: now this sets forth the
   extensiveness of Christ's omniscience, and that general and universal
   knowledge he is possessed of; which sense is much favored by R. Sol.
   Jarchi's note on the words. 2. Christ's eyes were set, or sitting upon
   the fullness of time in which he was to come into the world, and
   perform the great work of redemption; for as he was appointed to be the
   author of this work, and the persons were pitched upon whom he was to
   redeem, so the time was also fixed when he was to do it; and this is
   called "the fullness of time," in Ephesians 1:10; Galatians 4:4; and
   now, from the first making of the everlasting covenant, down throughout
   the whole Old Testament dispensation, Christ's eye was fixed on this
   fullness; waiting, watching, as it were longing till the time was come,
   when he should appear in human nature, and do the work which his heart
   was so much set upon; witness his many appearances in an human form
   before his incarnation, and the frequent notices he gave of his near
   approach. 3. Christ's eyes are set, or sitting upon his fullness, the
   church, whom in the fullness of time he came into this world to redeem:
   the church is called so, in Ephesians 1:23, which "is his body, the
   fullness of him that filleth all in all;" and then is she, and will she
   appear to be so, when all his elect ones are called by grace; and these
   all filled with those gifts and graces of the Spirit designed, for
   them, by him who is ascended to fill all things; and more especially
   when they are all grown up in proportion, unto the measure of the
   stature of the fullness of Christ: now Christ's eye is upon his church,
   and upon every member of it, until all this is done; and will be so
   when time shall be no more. 4. His eyes were, and still are set, or
   sitting upon the fullness of the Gentiles, until that is brought in:
   his eye was upon them in the everlasting covenant; therefore both he
   and his Father thought fit that he should be not only the redeemer of
   Israel, but a light to the Gentiles also, and be God's salvation unto
   the ends of the earth: his eye was upon them during the Old Testament
   dispensation; and therefore gave out many promises and prophecies
   concerning their calling: his eye was upon them when he died and
   suffered; and therefore he became a propitiation, not for the Jews
   only, but also for the Gentile world: his eye was upon them when he
   gave the commission to his disciples to preach the gospel; and
   therefore bid them "go into all the world, and preach it to every
   creature;" which he owned for the conversion of thousands: and his eye
   is still upon them, and will be so, until all those other sheep are
   brought in which are not of the Jewish fold. 5. His eyes are set, or
   sitting on his own personal fullness as God; for "in him dwelleth all
   the fullness of the godhead bodily:" his eye was upon this when he
   undertook the work of redemption, and so it was when he was actually
   concerned in it; therefore he failed not, neither was he discouraged;
   this supported him under it, and comfortably carried him through it. .
   His eyes are set, or sitting upon his fullness as mediator; which is a
   dispensative, communicative fullness put into his hands, to be
   distributed to his people; and his eye is continually upon it, to
   supply the wants of his people out of it, under all their straits,
   difficulties, temptations, sorrows, and afflictions: and where Christ's
   eyes are fixed, there should ours be also; we should be continually
   looking to, and be strong, not in ourselves, but in "the grace which is
   in Christ Jesus."

Chapter 5 Verse 13

   His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers:
   his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words are the fourth and fifth particular instances of
   Christ's beauty; for having described him by his head, locks, and eyes,
   she here describes him by his cheeks and lips; still keeping in a
   beautiful and regular order in her description of him. And,

   First, She describes him by his cheeks; which, she says, "are as a bed
   of spices, as sweet flowers:" by which we are to understand, not the
   smooth and naked cheeks, but with hair growing upon them, which best
   suits with the metaphor of a bed of spices; for as aromatic plants and
   sweet-smelling flowers bud out, and spring up from a bed of spices, and
   make it look very beautiful; so the hair of a man's beard puts itself
   forth, and grows upon his cheeks, or jaws, [691] as the word may be
   rendered, and makes him look very graceful and majestic: R. Aben Ezra
   understands by his cheeks, his beard; as also do many Christian
   Interpreters. [692] And this was literally true of Christ; who was not
   "an infant of days," but a man grown up, when he suffered in the room
   and stead of sinners; as is manifest from his "giving his back to the
   smiters, and his cheeks to those that plucked off the hair." The cheeks
   rising, and being a little elevated, are fitly described by beds in a
   garden; or fragrant flowers, or fruit trees, reared up in the form of
   towers, as some render the word, or pyramids; or by a dish of
   sweetmeats placed in such a figure: and the hair of the cheeks or
   beard, are aptly represented by spices, rising up from a bed of them;
   and all denote the beauty, savor and majesty of Christ: or, as the
   Vulgate Latin version, "as beds of spices set by confectioners; [693]
   not as aromatic plants, set in rows by the gardener; but as the spices
   themselves, set in rows by the confectioner in vessels, or placed in
   such a manner in his shop to be sold, [694] which being of various
   colors, especially red and white, the cheeks, for color and eminence,
   are compared to them. And being taken in a mystical and spiritual
   sense, may intend, either,

   1st, Believers, who are the hair of Christ's cheeks, as well as of his
   head: these grow upon him, receive their life and nourishment from him,
   and are ornamental to him: these are as "a bed of spices and sweet
   flowers;" for, being "perfumed with the myrrh and frankincense" of his
   grace, they ascend upwards in the exercise of faith, hope and love, as
   "towers of perfumes, [695] as the words translated sweet flowers may be
   rendered; they are fruitful in themselves, like a spicy bed,
   odoriferous to Christ, and delightful to each other. Or else,

   2dly, The graces of the Spirit which are in Christ as man and mediator:
   these, like the hair of a man's beard which grow upon his cheeks, adorn
   the man Christ Jesus, and render him very lovely and graceful; these
   grow in large numbers on him; he is "full of grace and truth;" and
   though there is a large communication of grace made daily to believers
   from this fullness which is in Christ; yet it is no way lessened
   thereby, even as the hair of a man's beard, which the oftener cut, the
   thicker and faster it grows. Now these lovely cheeks thus adorned, may
   be said to be "as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers," because of their
   beauty and loveliness; no spicy bed, set and filled with aromatic
   plants and sweet-smelling flowers, can be more lovely and delightful to
   the eye of sense, than Christ, with all his grace, is to the eye of
   faith; the reason why he appears to a believer "fairer than the
   children of men," is, because grace, in all its fullness, "is poured
   into his lips:" also they may be compared to these, because of the
   sweet odor of them; the effluvias of the sweet flowers and most
   fragrant spices growing in large numbers, in beds of them, cannot be
   more grateful to the smell, than the graces of Christ are to believers;
   and therefore they are compared to ointments, the savor of which cheats
   the minds, and attracts the hearts of his people to him: this oil of
   gladness being powered plentifully on his head, runs clown his beard,
   and so to every part of his garments; which makes them all "smell of
   myrrh, aloes and cassia;" and renders him, and all that belong, to him,
   sweet, savory, and delightful to his saints. Likewise they may be
   compared to "a bed of spices and sweet flowers," because of the variety
   of them: as in an aromatic garden there are various beds, and in those
   beds various spices, plants and flowers; so there is in Christ a
   variety of the gifts and graces of the Spirit; there are diversities of
   gifts, and all sorts of grace, which make up that fullness, from whence
   believers receive grace for grace, Or else,

   3dly, This may be expressive of the manliness and courage, prudence,
   gravity and majesty of Christ; when the beard appears in men like "a
   bed of spices," thick and well-grown; it is a manifest indication that
   they are grown up to the estate of men, and are at years of discretion.
   Now Christ's manliness and courage appeared in his boldly refuting the
   errors of the Pharisees and Sadducees; and in preaching the everlasting
   gospel, though he often ran the risk of his life in doing it; and to
   the very last he bore a noble testimony to it, and "witnessed a good
   confession" of it before many witnesses: as alto he gave a manifest
   discovery of it at the time of his being "taken by his enemies; as well
   as in Pilate's hall, where he was smitten, buffeted, scourged, mocked,
   and spit on; and yet in the midst of all, discovered the greatest
   undauntedness and composure of mind; but never more than while he was
   bearing his Father's wrath, and the strokes of divine justice,
   grappling with his and our enemies, and undergoing a painful and
   ignominious death; for under all this he failed not, neither was he
   discouraged. His "cheeks being as a bed of spices," shew him to be
   endued with manliness and courage, which he thus discovered; as they
   also show his prudence and gravity, which he manifested in all his
   discourses, "questions and answers; for " in him are hid all the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge;" for at twelve years of age, when
   the lovely down scarce appeared upon his cheeks, he discoursed with so
   much wisdom and gravity, put such questions to the doctors, and
   returned such answers to theirs, as filled them with wonder and
   surprise: and much more did he so, when his "cheeks were as a bed of
   spices;" when he was grown up to man's estate, and was entered upon his
   public ministry; he spake with so much wisdom and authority, that his
   audience was amazed at him; he dealt so prudently, according to the
   prophecy of him, that the subtle Scribes and Pharisees did not care to
   meddle with him; for as they could not answer his questions, so they
   dare not put any to him; his enemies themselves being witnesses, "never
   man spake like him." And this prudence and gravity of his appeared
   throughout the whole conduct of his life; his words were with power and
   authority; his deportment was grave and serious; and his walk and
   conversation, as it was in all holiness and righteousness towards God,
   so it was in all wisdom and prudence towards men.

   But if by cheeks, we understand that part of the face as smooth and
   naked, without the additional consideration of hair upon them; then by
   them may be meant, either,

   1st, The scriptures of truth. [696] The Targum understands them of the
   two tables of stone, which were written in ten lines, like the rows or
   beds of an aromatic garden, productive of acute and delightful senses;
   much to the same purpose does R. Solomon Jarchi give the sense of them:
   but it seems better to understand them of the whole word of God, the
   scriptures both of the Old and New Testament. These are as it were the
   cheeks or face of Christ, which represent and set forth the glory of
   his person, the virtue of his blood, the excellency of his
   righteousness, and the riches of his grace: these may be said to be "as
   a bed of spices, as sweet flowers," being in several distinct plots or
   beds: for this garden of the scriptures was not thrown up at once, and
   formed in that beautiful order in which now it is; but first one spicy
   bed was made, and then another; for "God at sundry times, and in divers
   manners, spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets:" these
   beds are set with a variety of "exceeding great and precious promises,"
   and excellent doctrines; which the meditating soul, like the
   industrious bee, sucks much sweetness from: all those excellent spices,
   and sweet-smelling flowers which grow here, have their different
   usefulness; for "all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
   profitable for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in
   righteousness," (2 Tim. 3:16). And as aromatic plants and fragrant
   flowers are delightful to the eye, sweet to the smell, and refreshing
   to the senses, so are these truths and promises; they are like "apples
   of gold in pictures of silver" to the eye of faith; diffuse a
   delightful odor to the smell, give a savor of Christ's knowledge, when
   and wherever explained; and being held in the hand of faith, refresh
   all the spiritual senses, and are "the joy and rejoicing of the heart."
   Or else,

   2dly, By Christ's cheeks, may be meant his presence with his people,
   and the manifestation of himself unto them in his word and ordinances.
   Thus the presence of God is frequently called his face in scripture; as
   when saints are said to seek his face, or he is said to hide his face
   from them; which are to be understood of God's withdrawing his presence
   from them, and their desire of enjoying it: thus Christ's presence with
   his people may be set forth by his cheeks or face; which when they
   enjoy, they see him in his beauty, behold him in his glory, and are
   ravished with his love: and this may be said to be "as a bed of spices,
   as sweet flowers;" for nothing is so desirable and delightful to
   believers as this; walking in the light of Christ's countenance, is far
   preferable to walking among beds of spices, where the most fragrant
   plants and odoriferous flowers grow; nothing that is earthly and
   sensual, with all its affluence and pleasure, can so strike the carnal
   senses, as the presence of Christ does the spiritual ones. Or else,

   3dly, The cheeks being the seat of modesty, bashfulness and blushing,
   may intend the humility of Christ; which appeared in his assumption of
   our nature, and throughout the whole course of his life, and more
   especially at his death: and this is a very great ornament to him, and
   renders him very delightful to his people. How lovely does the meek and
   lowly Jesus look! how beautiful are those blushing cheeks of his, who,
   though he was "equal with God, yet was found in fashion as a man!" and
   though possessed of all divine perfections, and transcendent
   excellencies, yet always spoke modestly of himself; and did not seek
   his own, but his Father's glory, and the good of his people.

   Secondly, Which is indeed the fifth particular instance of his beauty,
   she describes him by his lips; which, she says, are like lilies,
   dropping sweet smelling myrrh:" lips being the instruments of speech,
   and those compared to lilies, may be expressive of florid language and
   eloquence; so Lucian [697] describes the Trojan orators as having a
   lilian voice, that is, a florid and eloquent one. And by lips, may be
   meant the words of Christ; which are like lilies, 1. For purity; "the
   words of the Lord are pure words, as silver tried in a furnace of
   earth, purified seven times:" Christ's words are free from all
   pollution and defilement, from all scurrility and raillery, from all
   deceit and hypocrisy, and from all human mixtures whatever; and
   therefore his word is called "the sincere milk of the word." 2. His
   lips are compared to lilies for the beauty of them: and I suppose that
   not white lilies are here meant, but purple or red lilies; of which
   Pliny [698] speaks, the flower of which, he says, some call the
   rose-lily; so Maimonides [699] speaks of red lilies, by which he
   interprets drwz the rose; which, he says, have a good smell, and of
   them it is said, his lips, like lilies, Song of Solomon 5:13 and also
   R. Alshech on the text: the best of these grew in Syria, in Antioch,
   and Loadicea; [700] and these best suit with lips; for not white, but
   red lips, [701] are accounted the most beautiful; and therefore Christ
   compares the church's lips to "a thread of scarlet," in chapter 4:3.
   There is a beauty and loveliness in all Christ's words; they are
   pleasant ones; they are gracious words, or words of grace, which drop
   from his lips; and indeed how can his lips drop any other? his speech
   cannot be but always with grace, and with gracefulness, when grace
   itself is poured into his lips. 3. They may be compared to lilies for
   the fineness, thinness, softness and delicateness of them: thinness, as
   well as redness, adds a beauty to the lips: Christ's voice was not
   heard, his lips did not move in setting forth his own praises; for he
   sought not his own, but his Father's glory; he did not speak for
   himself, but his words and actions spoke for him; he did as Solomon
   advised (Prov. 27:2), "Let another man praise thee, and not thine own
   mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips." 4. They may be compared to
   lilies for the sweet odor of them: Christ's lips drop "sweet-smelling
   myrrh; his words, his gospel, and the doctrines of it, diffuse an
   agreeable savor; to some they are "the savor of life unto life;" and
   though they are "the savor of death unto death" to others, yet that
   does not arise from Christ's words in themselves, but is owing to their
   being rejected, slighted, and contemned by men. 5. They may be compared
   to lilies for the glory and majesty of them: Christ says, that "Solomon
   in all his glory was not arrayed like one of the lilies of the field;"
   Christ's words come with authority, and are clothed with power; "the
   voice of the Lord is powerful, the voice of the Lord is full of
   majesty," (Ps. 29:4).

   Again, these lips of Christ are said to drop "sweet-smelling myrrh;"
   for the construction is not with lilies, but with lips; for myrrh does
   not drop from lilies, but may be said to do so from Christ's lips:
   though some [702] think, the allusion is to crowns, made of red or
   purple lilies, wore at nuptial feasts, on which were poured oil of
   myrrh, and so dropped from them; but it is from the lips, and not
   lilies, the myrrh is said to drop. And here we may consider, 1st, The
   matter of those words which drop from Christ's lips, which is said to
   be as "sweet-smelling myrrh." 2dly, The manner of the delivery of them,
   which is dropping.

   1st, The matter of Christ's words is like "sweet-smelling myrrh." 1.
   Grateful and acceptable as such; Christ's lips drop the "sweet-smelling
   myrrh" of peace and reconciliation to rebellious sinners, pardon to
   guilty ones, rest to those that are burdened, comfort to the
   distressed, and life to all his people: this he did in the days of his
   flesh, and still continues to do by his ministering servants; who are
   his lips, by whom he speaks, and are thought by some [703] to be
   chiefly intended here; and so will his lips drop "sweet-smelling
   myrrh," the words of eternal life, when he shall say, "come, ye blessed
   of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
   of the world." 2. His lips drop words, for matter like "sweet swelling
   myrrh," preserving from rottenness, putrefaction and corruption:
   Christ's words preserve from the corruption of sin; his doctrines are
   "according to godliness;" they are so far from having a tendency to
   encourage persons in sin, that they are the best antidote and
   preservative against it; the doctrines of grace teach us "to deny
   ungodliness and worldly lusts;" they are the means of implanting and
   maintaining principles opposite to them: they also preserve from the
   corruption of false doctrines, which are pernicious to souls, and "eat
   as do a canker;" but Christ's words are wholesome ones; and those whose
   hearts are established with them, are not "carried about with divers
   and strange doctrines;" nor are they "tossed to and fro with every
   wind" of error, but retain their steadfastness in Christ Jesus:
   likewise, wherever Christ's words come with power, they preserve from
   going down to "the pit of corruption;" for Christ says that whosoever
   "keeps his sayings, shall never see death," that is, the second death.

   2dly, The manner of the delivery of Christ's words; which, as the
   matter of them is grateful, this is grateful, and is said to be
   dropping, 1. Gradually, and not all at once: Christ did not speak all
   at once to his disciples, but by little and little, as they were able
   to bear it; they had not their light, knowledge and comfort all at
   once; no more have saints now, nor must they expect it; we are first
   babes, then young" men, and then fathers in Christ. 2. Seasonably, at
   proper times, as the wants and necessities of his people require; for
   "God hath given him the tongue of the learned, that he may know how to
   speak a word in season to him that is weary," (Isa. 50:4). 3.
   Constantly; his lips dropped sweet-smelling myrrh when on earth, and
   still drop it now he is in heaven; "see that ye refuse not him that
   speaketh;" that now speaketh, continues to speak, and will do so until
   all his people are gathered in. 4. Powerfully and effectually; though
   his words do but drop, yet they drop with power; they make and leave
   impressions where they drop; they work effectually in them that
   believe. 5. Yet sweetly and gently; not like hasty and sudden showers
   of rain, which beat down the grass and corn; but as rain that drops
   gently and mildly, and so is acceptable to the earth, and makes it
   fruitful; "my doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil
   as the dew," etc. (Deut. 32:2). Now this graceful and agreeable manner
   of his delivery, as well as the grateful matter of his words, render
   him very acceptable to his church, and shew him to be a most excellent
   person, and "the chiefest among ten thousand;" which is what she
   attempts to demonstrate, in this description, to the daughters of
   Jerusalem. The kisses of Christ's lips, or the manifestations of his
   love, may be taken into the sense of these words which are as
   delightful as sweet-smelling myrrh; see chapter 1:2 and such a
   sentiment is expressed in the same language by others. [704]

Chapter 5 Verse 14

   His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl:
   his belly is as bright ivory, overlaid with sapphires
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words contain the sixth and seventh particular in stances of
   Christ's beauty, or distinguishing characters of him, whereby he might
   be known from all other beloveds, and wherein he was preferable to
   them.

   I.She describes him by "his hands;" which, she says, "are as gold set
   with the beryl."

   II.By "his belly or bowels;" which, she says, "is as bright ivory
   overlaid with sapphires."

   I.She sets forth the beauty and loveliness of his hands, by comparing
   them with "gold rings set with the beryl;" which is the sixth
   particular instanced in: it was usual in former times, as now, for gold
   rings to be set with one precious stone or another, [705] and
   particularly with the beryl. [706] And by his hands may be meant,
   either,

   1st, The munificence and liberality of Christ, manifested in the
   distributions of his grace to his own people: all grace is in Christ's
   hands, being put there by God the Father, as an instance of his love to
   Christ, as mediator, and his regard to those whom he made his care and
   charge; "the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
   hands," (John 3:35), all fullness of grace is in Christ, of justifying,
   sanctifying, pardoning and adopting grace; all the blessings and
   promises of the covenant are in his hands; all fullness of wisdom and
   strength, light and life, peace, joy and comfort, is with him which is
   all lodged in his hands, in order to be distributed to God's chosen
   ones: Christ, as the ascended Lord and King, "received gifts for men,"
   and as such, gives them to them; the daily experience of souls testify
   it, for "of his fullness we all receive, and grace for grace." Christ
   does all this liberally, and upbraideth not; he does not do it with a
   reflection on our "unworthiness; nor does he hit us on the teeth of our
   manifold sins and transgressions: as he does not withhold the blessings
   of grace from those they belong to; so when he gives, he does not do it
   grudgingly, but freely and cheerfully; not sparingly, but plenteously;
   he openeth his hands wide, and largely communicates to his people: all
   which he does wisely and prudently, at such times and in such ways, as
   will best suit with their wants and necessities; for as a "wise and
   faithful steward" of God's grace, he gives to every one "their portion
   of meat in due season." And now these hands of Christ's, which so
   faithfully and wisely, so liberally, freely and largely distribute the
   blessings of grace to the saints, are as beautiful and lovely as hands
   adorned with gold rings, set with the most valuable precious stones:
   How glorious does he appear to the eye of faith, "as exalted to be a
   prince and a Savior, to give repentance unto Israel, and forgiveness of
   sins," with his hands full of grace, and a heart to give it! How
   beautiful do both his right and left hand look, in whose "right hand is
   length of days," and in whose "left hand are riches and honor!" Or
   else,

   2dly, By his hands may be meant his power in working: Christ's hands
   have always been active; "my father worketh hitherto, and I work;" that
   is, I have been working, and I continue to do so. Those hands of
   Christ, which are said to be "as gold rings," etc. laid the foundation
   of the heavens and the earth, formed all things out of nothing, reared
   up the beautiful structure of the universe, and filled it with proper
   inhabitants; for without him was not any thing made that was made:" and
   in doing this, his hands look like gold rings; there is a shine, a
   luster on them; the glory of the divine perfections appears in them;
   "the heavens declare his glory, and the firmament sheweth his
   handy-work;" these hands also bear up and support the pillars of the
   earth; and in this he appears to be the brightness of his Father's
   glory, and the express image of his person, in that he upholds all
   things, by the word of his power: these hands likewise hold the reins
   of government; the government of the whole universe in general, as well
   as of the church in particular, is in the hands and upon the shoulder
   of our Lord Jesus Christ: but in nothing does Christ's hands appear
   more beautiful and lovely, like gold rings set with the beryl, than in
   grasping, holding, and retaining the saints; who are put into his hand
   by God the Fathers where they are safe and secure; for out of his hands
   none can pluck: How beautiful do the hands of Christ look, in holding
   those bright stars, the ministers of the gospel there! for he "holdeth
   the seven stars in his right-hand:" and more do they appear so, when we
   view all the saints there; who are so many gold rings, jewels, pearls,
   and precious stones in Christ's esteem. Or else,

   3dly, By his hands may be meant, his works performed by his almighty
   power: as lips being the instruments of speech, intend Christ's words
   in the former verse; so hands being the instruments of action, may
   intend his works in this; such as the works of creation and providence,
   which are all formed in a beautiful order, in a delightful connection
   with, and an agree, able subordination and subserviency to each other;
   his works of miracles here on earth, on all which were a shine of
   deity, and were a demonstration of his being the true Messiah and
   Savior of the world; and more especially his works of grace and
   redemption, which may be said to be "as gold rings set with the beryl."
   1. For the perfection of them: the circular form is accounted the most
   perfect, and therefore they are compared to gold rings, which are of
   such a form; Christ is a rocks and his work is perfect, and
   particularly that of redemption: he does none of his works by halves;
   and especially this, which he never left till he could say, it is
   finished; and so being made perfect himself through sufferings, having
   perfectly fulfilled both the preceptive and penal parts of the law, he
   became the complete author of eternal salvation to all them that obey
   him. 2. For the excellency and glory of them; gold rings are valuable,
   beautiful and ornamental: all Christ's works of grace are glorious and
   honorable; and more especially this of redemption, in which the glory
   of all the three persons, and the glory of all the divine perfections,
   is manifestly displayed, and eternally secured; "his glory is great in
   thy salvation," (Ps. 21:5). 3. For the variety of them; gold rings, in
   the plural number, are here mentioned: Christ's works of grace are many
   and various, they are more than can be reckoned up; and even in the
   work of redemption, there is an admirable variety; many are the things
   which he has wrought out, brought in, and procured by his precious
   blood; such as a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin, peace and
   reconciliation, liberty of access to God, deliverance from all enemies,
   sin, Satan, hell, and death, etc. 4. Christ's hands in working out
   redemption, may be said to be as gold rings set with the beryl: this is
   one of the precious stones in the high priest's breast-plate, mentioned
   in Exodus 28:20 and is one of the pearl foundations of the new
   Jerusalem (Rev. 21:20), the appearance of the wheels in Ezekiel's
   vision, is said to be like it (Ezek. 1:16), and the body of that great
   person who appeared to Daniel, chapter 10:6, is said to be as this
   stone; so that it is no wonder that Christ's hands should be said to be
   as gold rings set with it.

   The Hebrew word Tarshish, here used, is sometimes the name of a person,
   and at other times the name of a place, and is used sometimes to
   signify the sea; and naturalists [707] tell us, that the best beryl is
   that which most resembles the color of the sea; thus all the three
   Targums on Exodus 28:20 call it amy µwrk crum yamma, from its being of
   a sea color; and Junius and Tremellius here render it, beryllus
   thalassius, the sea coloured beryl: this stone is found in India; and
   being carried about by persons, is said [708] to inspire them with
   courage to help them to conquer their enemies, and to put an end to
   strifes and controversies. Christ, whose hands are said to be as gold
   rings set with beryl, in working out man's redemption, discovered the
   utmost courage, resolution and magnanimity of mind; when he was bearing
   his Father's wrath, suffering the severe strokes of justice, and
   grappling with all his and our enemies; when he was deserted by his
   friends, forsaken by his God, and insulted by his enemies, he failed
   not, neither was he discouraged; when he saw that there was none to
   give him the least assistance, his own arm brought salvation to him; he
   stood the field, fought the battle alone, got an entire victory over
   all enemies, sin, Satan, and the world; saved us out of the hands of
   them all, and put an end to that grand controversy between God and us,
   occasioned by sin; he repaired that breach, made up that distance, and
   reconciled those two contending parties, by making peace between them,
   through the blood of his cross. 5. Some think that the chrysolite is
   here meant, as Ainsworth and others; which is a precious stone of a
   golden color, [709] from whence it has its name; it is mentioned in
   Revelation 21:20 and is said [710] to be good against melancholy, fear
   and folly, and to fill the mind with courage, cheerfulness and wisdom;
   which, being applied to Christ's hands in working out redemption, may
   shew that Christ not only performed this work with courage, but with
   cheerfulness, and also with the utmost wisdom: his wisdom appears in
   all the works of his hands, as the psalmist says (Ps. 104:24), "O Lord,
   how manifold are thy works, in wisdom hast thou made them all!" but in
   none more than in this of redemption, wherein he hath abounded towards
   us in all wisdom and prudence; this was so well contrived, and so fully
   effected, that all the divine perfections are glorified in it; he has
   herein secured the glory of justice and holiness, as well as given the
   greatest display of his grace and mercy; he has satisfied a broken law,
   and destroyed sin, and yet saved the sinner; herein appears the
   manifold wisdom of God; there is such a variety of it, and such a glory
   in it, that angels are amazed at it, and desire to look into it:
   Christ, as the great Redeemer, is not only the power, but also the
   wisdom of God; for in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge; of which he gave the fullest proof when he was concerned in
   this work. 6. Others think that the hyacinth or jacinth is here
   intended; Pagnine renders it, "full of precious stones, like hyacinth;
   the Vulgate Latin and Tigurine versions render it the same way; this is
   likewise mentioned in Revelation 21:20, it is of a violet or purple
   color, for which reason the flower so called has its name; [711] to be
   good against the bitings of venomous beasts; and being worn on the
   finger, and put about the neck, keeps strangers safe, and renders them
   grateful to their host: the bluish and purple color of this stone, and
   its ruby veins, which some say it has, may represent a crucified and
   bleeding Christ; when his precious hands, which are as gold rings,
   wrought out man's salvation; by whose blue wounds and purple streams of
   blood, souls have a cure for every disease; and particularly for those
   wounds which their sins, those scorpions within, and Satan, that old
   serpent without, have made in them; for by his stripes we are healed;
   it is the precious blood of Christ, and spotless righteousness and
   glorious redemption wrought out thereby, which being applied by the
   Spirit, and laid hold on by faith, preserve souls safe from all enemies
   and evils, as sin, Satan, law, hell and wrath; and which only render
   them grateful and acceptable to God; for saints are only accepted in
   the beloved on the foot of redemption, and upon the account of his
   justifying righteousness; for the Lord is well pleased for his
   righteousness-sake, because he hath magnified the law, and made it
   honorable (Isa. 42:21). 7. Others have thought that the sardonyx is
   intended, as Cocceius; this is an Arabian gem, and one of the principal
   ones; it is a composition of the sardius and onyx stones [712] , as
   appears from the name; it is of a white and ruddy color, and much
   resembles the nail of a man's hand, set in flesh, both for color and
   smoothness; and it used to be set in rings, and wore on the hand; hence
   an hand adorned with one, is called sardonychata manus [713] ; and a
   ring set with this stone, was called sardonyche [714] : this is also
   mentioned in Revelation 21:20, and may represent the glorious deity,
   innocent humanity, and bloody sufferings of Christ, whose hands have
   obtained eternal redemption for us; it was necessary that he should
   die, in order to satisfy for our sins, which he could not have done,
   had he had any sin of his own; neither would the sufferings of this
   innocent person have been sufficient, had he been a mere creature, and
   not truly God: it is by the precious blood of Christ that we are
   redeemed, and by the blood of Christ, as of a lamb without spot and
   blemish; and what made this blood powerful and efficacious to such a
   purpose, is the influence of the divine nature: all these three may be
   observed in one verse (Heb. 9:14).

   II.She describes him by his belly, which, she says, is as bright ivory
   overlaid with sapphires. The generality of ancient interpreters [715]
   understand by belly, the human nature of Christ, which is expressed by
   this part, because of the frailty and weakness of it: Christ's human
   nature, though not attended with sinful, yet with all sinless
   infirmities; he was encompassed with them; and was a man of sorrows,
   and acquainted with griefs; and yet, like ivory, was firm, constant,
   and immoveable in sufferings, being supported and .strengthened by the
   divine nature, he appeared to be the man, of God's right hand, the son
   of man whom he made strong for himself; and, like bright and white
   ivory, pure, holy, innocent and spotless; and now like bright and white
   ivory overlaid: with sapphires, being glorified and exalted at God's
   right hand. Ivory is used to express the beauty of persons; see chapter
   7:7, so the beauty of Æneas is described by it [716] ; even by such as
   has been in the hands of a workman, smoothed and polished by him, and
   so become bright, as here called: the sapphire is used to express the
   glory and majesty of the Divine Being, in Exodus 24:10.

   The Septuagint render it thus, "his belly is an ivory box upon a
   sapphire stone [717] ," and this serves very well to represent the
   body, and may very aptly be applied to the human nature of Christ, in
   which "the fullness of the Godhead dwells," and displays its glory: but
   the words may be better rendered, "his bowels are as bright ivory,"
   etc., [718] so the same word is translated in verse 4, and may express
   the love, grace, mercy, pity and compassion of Christ to poor souls;
   which may be compared to bright ivory, 1. For the valuableness and
   excellency of it: the ivory is the tooth of the elephant, and is very
   valuable; Solomon made himself a throne of it, and overlaid it with
   gold; that is, studded it, and enameled it with gold, as this is said
   to be sapphires: nothing is so valuable as Christ's love; the brightest
   ivory, the richest jewels, most precious stones, and excellent
   sapphires, are not to be compared to it; his "loving; kindness is
   better than life," or all the things which render life comfortable and
   delightful. 2. For the purity, sincerity, and chastity of it; there is
   no spot, stain, or blemish of hypocrisy and deceit in it; but like pure
   bright ivory, is without the least sully or tarnish: nor is there any
   reason for jealousy" of it; both the ivory and the sapphire are
   observed to be preservatives of chastity; and though God's children are
   often jealous of Christ's love, yet they have no reason for it; for as
   he loves them above all others, so he loves none but them in that way;
   and he "rests in his love" towards them, and is the "same yesterday, to
   day, and for ever." 3. For the firmness, constancy and durableness of
   it; ivory is firm and lasting; Christ's love is so; it is from
   everlasting to everlasting, always the same, never varies, and will
   continue so for ever; for "having loved his own which were in the
   world, he loved them unto the end." 4. For its reviving, refreshing and
   strengthening nature; ivory, to which Christ's bowels are here
   compared, is said [719] to be a great strengthener of the bowels and
   inward parts: Christ's love being shed abroad in our hearts, revives
   our fainting souls, puts new strength into our graces, and makes us not
   ashamed or confounded, even in a day of trouble. 5. It is like bright
   ivory "overlaid with sapphires;" that is, either covered with them, as
   the word signifies, or rather enameled with them: of this precious
   stone frequent mention is made in scripture; it is used to express the
   glory of God (Ex. 24:10), and the throne of his majesty is said to be
   as the appearance of it (Ezek. 1:26), the beauty of the Nazarites is
   represented by it (Lam. 4:7), and the glory of the church in the latter
   day: (Isa. 54:11), it was one of the precious gems in the high-priest's
   breast-plate; and one of the foundations of the new Jerusalem: some of
   the Jewish writers [720] say, that the two tables on which the law was
   engraven was made of this; it is a very clear and transparent gem [721]
   , of a coerulean or sky color, shining with golden specks; it is said
   [722] to help those that are bitten with scorpions, to defend the heart
   from the infection of poison, and to cure intestine ulcers: this may
   all serve to set forth the glory and excellency of Christ's love; it is
   this oil of love, grace and mercy, which being poured in by the good
   Samaritan, heals the wounds that sin has made, and preserves from the
   dreadful effects of its poison and venom. Albertus Magnus [723] says,
   that the sapphire creates peace and concord, and renders the mind pure
   and devout to God; but whether this be so or no, it is certain that the
   love of Christ, discovered to a poor distressed sinner, produces
   calmness and serenity of mind, creates "a peace which passeth all
   understanding;" removes that enmity, and weakens the remains of it,
   which is naturally in the heart of man against God, Christ, his gospel,
   people, ways and ordinances; there is nothing attracts our love to
   Christ as this does; "we love him because he first loved us:" nor is
   there any thing that more engages our hearts in acts of obedience to
   him than this; it is this which lays us under obligation, constrains us
   to, and enforces on us a regard to all his commands and ordinances, and
   makes us most cheerful in our observance of them.

   But there are some interpreters [724] who think, that not any part of
   the body is here described, as the belly or bowels, but rather that
   some covering of those parts is intended; and in, deed it does not seem
   so agreeable with the rules of decency, nor consistent with the
   spouse's modesty, to describe her beloved by those naked parts to the
   daughters of Jerusalem; any more than it does with the scope of the
   place, which is to give some distinguishing marks and characters of him
   to them, that they might know him from another; but these parts being
   out of sight, and not exposed to public view, a description of them
   could be of no service to them in this respect; nor indeed does what is
   said serve so much to commend the belly, as it does some covering of
   it: R. Aben Ezra thinks the girdle about the loins is here meant; and
   if so, it may intend either Christ's royal girdle, which is a girdle of
   righteousness and faithfulness; all his regal administrations being
   performed, as well according to the strictest rules of justice and
   equity, as with the utmost wisdom and prudence: or else, his priestly
   girdle, which is called a golden one (Rev. 1:13), and is no doubt an
   allusion to what the high-priest wore: or else, the covering intended
   may respect the embroidered coat of the high-priest, which covered his
   whole body; whose embroidery were holes or incisures, in which, as
   Jarchi [725] says, were put jewels and precious stones; and so as the
   church described Christ as a prince before, she is thought to describe
   him here as a priest: or rather, the ephod with the breast-plate is
   here alluded to, in which were twelve precious stones, and, among the
   rest, the sapphire, on which were engraven the names of the twelve
   tribes of Israel; and it is certain, that the Targum on this place has
   reference to it; for it mentions the stones one by one, with the
   several names of the tribes engraven on them: and this may represent
   Christ, as the great high-priest, bearing all his elect ones upon his
   heart in heaven, having entered there in their name to appear and plead
   for them, and to take possession of glory for them in their stead,
   until they are brought into the actual enjoyment of it themselves.

Chapter 5 Verse 15

   His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold:
   his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words contain the eighth and ninth particular instances of
   Christ's beauty, given by the church to the daughters of Jerusalem, or
   distinguishing characters of him, whereby they might know and discern
   him from all others. And,

   I.She describes him by "his legs," which, she says," are as pillars of
   marble, set upon sockets of fine gold."

   II.By "his countenance;" which, she says, is, 1st, "As Lebanon." 2dly,
   "Excellent as the cedars."

   I.She describes him by his legs; which she says, "are as pillars of
   marble, set upon sockets of fine gold;" which is the eighth particular
   of this glorious description of Christ. The word translated legs, may
   as well be rendered thighs; which may very well be compared to marble
   pillars, both for form and color; especially when we consider, that it
   does not appear that the ancient Jews did in common wear any thing upon
   their thighs and legs, but only sandals upon their feet: or perhaps, by
   thighs may be meant, the femoralia [727] , or garments on the thighs,
   which were wore by the priests when they ministered in holy things. I
   have observed that some interpreters think, that some garment of the
   high priest, either his girdle, or his embroidered coat, or the ephod,
   with the breast plate, is intended by the belly, in the latter part of
   the preceding verse; so that as Christ was described as a prince
   before, he is now described as a priest; which description may be still
   carried on here. These femoralia, or garments for the thighs, were made
   of fine linen (Ex. 28:42),nd so are very aptly represented by white
   marble; they are also said to be made of fine twisted linen (Ex.
   39:28), which the Jewish Rabbins [728] say, was of thread six times
   doubled; and therefore these breeches must sit very full and stiff,
   like pillars of marble: and this may set forth the pure mad spotless
   righteousness of Christ, which is called, in Revelation 19:8, fine
   linen, clean and white, it is this which covers our nakedness, hides
   the impunities of our nature, and renders us acceptable unto
   God.Moreover, below these breeches of the priest, was the hem of the
   holy robe, round about which were set pomegranates and golden bells;
   which perhaps may be meant by the "sockets of fine gold," on which
   those pillars of marble were set; and may intend the glory and
   excellency of the righteousness of our great high. priest, Christ
   Jesus.

   Moreover, in this description, the church seems to take in thighs,
   legs, and feet; his thighs and legs are compared to pillars of marble,
   and that very aptly; his feet are intended by "the sockets of fine
   gold; which either respects the sandals bound about the feet with
   golden ribbands; or the custom of some who used to adorn their shoes
   with gold and precious stones [729] : and that nothing may be wanting
   to set off her beloved as the most excellent, she represents him as
   having such sandals or shoes upon his feet; golden sandals on his
   snow-white marble feet and legs [730] for white marble is meant, such
   as Parian marble, so Aquila and Theodotion render it; or shoes gilt in
   the upper part, as noblemen in Spain wore, as Lyra on the place
   observes. And now Christ's legs being said to be "as pillars of marble,
   etc.," may denote,

   1st, The strength and power of Christ to bear tip and support what is
   or has been laid upon him: much of a man's strength is in his legs;
   these are by Solomon called "the strong men," (Eccl. 12:3), and are the
   pillars and support of the body which, when they begin to bow
   themselves, it is an indication that this earthly tabernacle is ready
   to be dissolved: Christ is the rock of ages in whom is everlasting
   strength; his legs are as pillars of marble, as pillars of marble, set
   upon sockets of fine gold, firm and immoveable, lasting and durable, 1.
   To bear the weight of the whole universe [731] : the earth, with all
   the inhabitants thereof, would soon be dissolved, did not he bear up
   the pillars of it; as he made all things, so he upholds all things by
   the word of his power; with all the created inhabitants of it, have
   their dependence on him and are upheld by him; for as "he is before all
   things, so by him do all things consist." 2. To bear the whole weight
   of the covenant of grace: it was the business of the Levites to bear
   the ark of the covenant; but Christ is the covenant itself; he is so
   both materially and fundamentally; he is the matter, sum and substance
   of it ; he is the basis and foundation of it; all the blessings of it
   are upon him; and all the promises of it are in him, yea and amen: it
   is this which makes the covenant of grace, with all its blessings and
   mercies, sure, and renders it preferable to the covenant of works
   because it is "established upon better promises;" which promises are
   upon a better foundation, and that is the Lord Jesus Christ. 3. To bear
   all the persons of the elect: as the legs of a man bear and support the
   whole body, so Christ's legs, which are as pillars of marble, bear up
   and support his whole body, the church: thus Christ bore and
   represented the persons of the elect in the everlasting covenant, and
   received all grace for them; and so he did when he hung upon the cross,
   when he died and rose again; and so he does now he is in heaven, even
   as Aaron bore the names of the children of Israel upon his
   breast-plate, for a memorial before the Lord. 4. To bear all their sins
   and transgressions: so Aaron bore the iniquity of the holy things of
   the children of Israel; and so did the scapegoat bear upon him their
   iniquities unto a land not inhabited; and therein were both types of
   Christ, who was manifested in our nature for this purpose; on whom God
   the Father laid the iniquity of us all, and who actually bore it in his
   own body on the tree; and by so doing, made satisfaction for it. 5. To
   bear all the punishment due to sin: sin being laid on him, he, as the
   sinner's surety, bore the whole weight of his Father's displeasure for
   it; he had not the least abatement of his wrath, but suffered the
   severest strokes of his justice; and yet he failed not, neither was he
   discouraged, or was not broken; it was enough to have broken the
   strength of men and angels; but he stood up under it, "his legs being
   as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold;" when God banished
   Cain from his presence, as an indication of his displeasure for his
   sin, he cried out, "My punishment is greater than I can bear;" and
   indeed, who can stand in his "sight when once he is angry?" and yet,
   what was this to what Christ bore in the room and stead of the elect?
   6. "His legs are as pillars of marble, etc.," to bear the whole care
   and government of his church: the government of the church in general
   is upon his shoulder; and indeed no other shoulder is capable of it but
   his who is "the mighty God, the everlasting Father, and Prince of
   Peace:" it may be said of him, in a much more eminent senses what Paul
   said of himself (2 Cor. 11:28), that "the care of all the churches was
   upon him;" the care of every particular believer, as well as of the
   church in general, is upon Christ; for they cast their care upon him,
   who careth for them. 7. They are so, and need be so, to bear all the
   burdens of his people: there was a complaint of the Jews in Nehemiah's
   time (Neh. 4:10), that the strength of the bearer of burdens was
   decayed, but this cannot be made of Christ, who is the bearer of his
   peoples burdens; for "his legs are as pillars of marble, etc.," he has
   said (Ps. 55:22), "Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain
   thee;" he has both willingness and ability, a heart and a hand to do
   it. 8. To bear up his people under all their afflictions, trials, and
   temptations: "in all their afflictions he is afflicted;" he supports
   and upholds them with the right hand of his righteousness; he suffers
   "no temptation" to befall them, but what he gives strength
   proportionate to it, "that they may be able to bear it;" he comfortably
   carries them through all the difficulties of life, and will not leave
   them till he has brought them to glory; for even "to hoary hairs" he
   will carry them; he has made, and he will bear them. 9. To bear them up
   and keep them from falling: he is able to do it, and he will do it; he
   is that "sure foundation," on which their souls being built, "the gates
   of hell" cannot prevail against them; and though they may be attended
   with many failings and infirmities, yea, with many slips and falls, yet
   they shall never fall totally and finally; for he "upholdeth them with
   his hand." 10. His legs are as "pillars of marble," etc. to bear "all
   the glory of his father's house;" for as he "builds the temple," it is
   proper that he should "bear the glory:" Adam had a great deal of glory
   put upon him, in being made after God's image and likeness, and in
   being the representative of, and a federal head unto all his posterity;
   but he "being in honor," did not abide long; the crown was too heavy
   for him, it soon fell from his head, he being a mutable creature: but
   Christ is "the same, yesterday, today, and for ever;" and will for ever
   continue to bear the glory of the God-man and mediator, which no mere
   creature is capable of, being no ways able to effect the work. And now,
   when we consider all these things, Christ's legs had need be, as indeed
   they are, "as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold."

   2dly, By Christ's legs may be meant, his ways and paths [732] , which
   he has trod in; for as legs are for the support of the body, so they
   are likewise the instruments of walking; and may intend, either, 1.
   Christ's ways of love, grace and mercy in the covenant; "whose goings
   forth" in it were "from of old, from everlasting;" these were, like
   "pillars of marble," firm and constant; his "counsels of old are
   faithfulness and truth," and like such, "set upon sockets of fine
   gold," glorious and excellent; the steps which were then taken, the
   measures and methods that were then concerted, were all to advance the
   glory of the three divine Persons, as well as to bring about and secure
   the salvation of sinners. Or, 2. The path of the incarnation which he
   trod in, as never any did before or since: it was a wondrous stoop, a
   surprising instance of his mighty grace, that he should come down from
   heaven, and converse with mortals on earth in our nature; and the
   manner in which this was done is no less amazing, as well as it is an
   indication of his love to his people, to be a partaker of the same
   flesh and blood with them. Or, 3. His walk and conversation here on
   earth, which, like "pillars of marble," was always upright, even and
   constant: he never went awry, or stepped aside from the path of
   righteousness and holiness; but always acted in a perfect conformity to
   the law of God, which he made the rule of his obedience; and upon the
   whole of his conduct and conversation, there appeared a beauty, glory
   and luster; so that his legs looked like "marble pillars set upon
   sockets of fine gold." Or else, 4. His walks in his churches, which are
   his "golden candlesticks;" among whom he delights to be, and to whom
   his presence is very beautiful and glorious, delightful and desirable.
   Or, 5. His providential dispensations to his people, which are
   sometimes "past finding out;" for his "way is in the sea, and his path
   in the great waters," so that his "footsteps are not known;" he seems
   sometimes to come forth against his people in a way of anger and
   displeasure; and then "his feet are like unto fine brass, as if they
   burned in a furnace," as they are represented in Revelation 1:15. But
   yet these are, (1.) Like pillars, straight and upright; for he "is
   righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works" and though wicked
   men, and sometimes God's own children, through peevishness, impatience
   and unbelief, may say that "the Lord's way is not equal," yet his is
   always equal, and theirs unequal. And, (2.) Like "pillars of marble,"
   are firm and constant; for "he is in one mind, and who can turn him?"
   and "what his soul desireth, even that he doth." And, (3.) They are
   like such pillars, "set upon sockets of fine gold;" the basis and
   foundation of them are his eternal purposes and decrees; for he
   "worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:" and this will
   all appear exceeding beautiful and glorious, when the book of purposes,
   ,and the book of providences are opened, and saints behold that
   delightful harmony and agreement which is between them; then will they
   sing the song of Moses and of the Lamb, saving, "Just and true are thy
   ways, thou King of saints, who shall not fear thee?" etc. "for thy
   judgments are made manifest," (Rev. 15:3, 4).

   3dly, These legs may set forth the power of Christ, in treading under
   and trampling upon all his and our enemies; so his legs were like
   "pillars of marble," etc. when he hung upon the cross, who then
   trampled upon and triumphed over sin, Satan, and the world; and so they
   are now he is in heaven, "for he must reign until he hath put all his
   enemies under his feet:" Christ's legs and feet, in the government of
   his church, and in the subduing of his enemies, are not like the legs
   and feet of Nebuchadnezzar's image, in Daniel 2:33, whose legs are said
   to be "of iron," and " his feet, part of iron and part of clay," which
   were easily demolished and destroyed;" but Christ's kingdom being a
   more glorious, durable, and lasting one, yea, an everlasting one, as in
   verse 44, therefore his legs are here compared to "pillars of marble,"
   and his feet to "sockets of fine gold;" his head and his feet are both
   of fine gold, which shows that his kingdom is glorious and excellent,
   and preferable to all others; and because Christ's legs and feet are
   such, hence the saints are "more than conquerors," and shall have all
   enemies trodden under their feet.

   4thly, Some [733] by these legs understand Christ's apostles, and the
   ministers of the gospel: who bear the name of Christ, carry his gospel,
   run to and fro, and diffuse "the savor of his knowledge in every
   place;" are pillars in his house, are instruments to support and
   strengthen his interest; and are marble ones, constant and immoveable
   in their work, cannot be diverted from it, either by the frowns or
   flatteries of the world: and in the discharge of their work, are very
   beautiful; "how beautiful are the feet of him that bringeth good
   tidings!" and what makes their feet so beautiful? because they are as
   it were shod with gold; they are "shod with the preparation of the
   gospel of peace," with the golden truths of the gospel; and this makes
   them look like "pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold."

   II.She describes him by "his countenance;" or his appearance [734] ,
   look or aspect; which is the ninth particular instanced in: by this is
   meant, not his countenance or look by which he beholds others; but that
   by which he is visible to, and beheld by others, and which recommends
   him to them; as his grand and majestic form, his tall stature, his
   graceful mein and deportment, and stately walk. And this she says, is,
   First, As Lebanon; which intends, either,

   1st, The mountain of Lebanon; which was a large and goodly mountain,
   abounding with fruitful and fragrant trees, situated on the north side
   of the land of Canaan: to which Christ may be compared, 1. For the
   height of it: Christ, as God, "is over all, blessed for ever;" as
   God-man and mediator, he has "a name given him above every name; he is,
   "higher than the kings of the earth," or than all the angels in heaven;
   he is of a more excellent nature, and has "obtained a more excellent
   name than they," 2. For pleasantness; Lebanon is called by Moses, that
   goodly mountain which before his death he had a great desire to see:
   Christ's countenance, form or personage, is more glorious and excellent
   than Lebanon, or any other mountain whatever; he is "the brightness of
   his Father's glory, and the express image of his person." 3. For the
   fruitfulness of it; Lebanon was a fruitful mountain for vines and
   cedars: on Christ all those "trees of righteousness" grow, which are
   the Lord's planting; from him they receive their life and nourishment,
   their verdure and fruitfulness; and by him they are supplied with all
   needful grace; for in him all fullness of it dwells, 4. For the
   fragrancy of it; hence we read that the saints smell is as Lebanon
   (Hosea 14:6), the trees and plants which grew there, were very
   odoriferous, and diffused a grateful smell to passers by: Christ's
   person, grace, righteousness, sacrifice, and all that belong to him,
   are exceeding savory to believers; and hence it is, that he is in this
   song compared to spikenard, myrrh, camphor, the rose and lily, etc.
   Lyra interprets this, not of the mountain of Lebanon, but of the
   aromatic tree, lebanah, or frankincense; so Theodoret.

   2dly, It may be meant of the forest of Lebanon. Some think, that she
   has a regard in this part of the description to the attire of the
   high-priest, in whose garments were curiously wrought the figures of
   animals, trees and flowers; so that when he had his robes on him, he
   might be thought in some measure to resemble a forest, and particularly
   this of Lebanon, which was esteemed the most excellent; and so may be
   expressive of the glory and excellency of Christ, as our great
   high-priest, so far exceeds Aaron and all his sons. Or else,

   3dly, It may be meant of the temple, which is sometimes called Lebanon,
   as in Zechariah 11:1, and it may be very well called so, because it was
   chiefly made of the wood of Lebanon: and Christ may be very well
   compared unto it, for the stateliness and magnificence of it; as well
   because that all that belonged to it, or were performed in it, were
   eminently typical of him, and did gloriously prefigure him; and hence
   he calls his body the temple, in John 2:19.

   Secondly, She says, that his countenance is, or "he is excellent or
   choice as the cedars" which grew on Lebanon; and her meaning is, that
   as the cedars in Lebanon were the choicest, and were preferable to all
   other trees, so was Christ her beloved to her: saints are compared to
   cedars (see Ps. 92:12; Num. 24:5, 6); but Christ is the chief cedar,
   the choicest of all the cedars; in him these are planted and take root,
   and by him they are made fruitful; to these sort of trees Christ may be
   compared, for their tallness, stateliness, fragrancy and durableness;
   but these and all other things failing short to express his beauty, and
   set off his greatness, she concludes the description in the following
   words.

Chapter 5 Verse 16a

   Former part. His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words we have,

   I.The tenth and last particular instance of Christ's beauty, or
   distinguishing character of him, whereby he might be known from all
   other beloveds; "his mouth is most sweet," or "sweetnesses."

   II.A comprehensive summary of all his excellencies and glories; "yea,
   he is altogether lovely."

   I.She here describes him by his mouth, which, she says, is most sweet
   [735] ; yea, sweetness itself, and that in the highest degree of it;
   sweetnesses, as the word may be rendered [736] . And by Christ's mouth
   here may be meant, either,

   1st, The words of his mouth [737] . In this sense is the word used, in
   Proverbs 5:3 and 8:7, and by them may be meant, the "doctrines of the
   gospel;" which are "the gracious words" that proceed out of Christ's
   mouth; and are sweet to believer's taste, administer spiritual
   refreshment to his soul, and are preferred by him to his "necessary
   food:" likewise the precious promises" of it are the words of Christ's
   mouth; which, if ever spoke to any purpose to a believer, they are
   spoke by Christ; and when they are so, they are exceeding sweet, and
   fill the soul with an unspeakable satisfaction. The kind invitations of
   the gospel also are not to be excluded, such as Isaiah 55:1; Matthew
   11:28; Revelation 22:17, which manifestly speak out the love and grace
   of Christ to sinners; and when applied with power by the blessed
   Spirit, are exceeding sweet, comfortable, and refreshing to the
   consciences of distressed sinners. Moreover, the comforts which Christ
   speaks to his people, either by his Spirit or by his ministers, may be
   included here; as well as his commands, which also are the words of his
   mouth, which he has enjoined us the observation of, and which are no
   ways grievous, but joyous to a believer; especially when he has the
   presence of Christ, the discoveries of his love, and is under the
   influences of the Spirit of grace, whilst he is engaged in acts of
   obedience to them: these "statutes and judgments of the Lord," as they
   are right and just in themselves, so they are to believers "more to be
   desired than gold, yea, than fine gold; sweeter also than the honey or
   the honey-comb;" for such is the grace of Christ, that what he has made
   the believer's duty, he also has made his privilege; and hence it is,
   that all wisdom's ways are "ways of pleasantness" to him, and the words
   of Christ's mouth are carefully regarded by him. Or,

   2dly, The kisses of Christ's mouth may be here intended, or the
   sensible manifestations of his love and grace to souls, which are what
   the church earnestly desired, in chapter 1:2, than which nothing can be
   more delightful to the saints: these give them more pleasure and
   satisfaction than all the things this world can afford; but both these
   seem to be intended before, namely, the words of his mouth by his lips,
   and the manifestations of his love by his cheeks; and therefore perhaps
   something different from these is designed here. And,

   3dly, Some [738] think, that Christ's voice in his ministers is here
   meant; this is net omitted in that glorious description of Christ which
   John gives, in Revelation 1, and which bears some resemblance to this,
   and is there said to be as the sound of many waters: now if it is not
   intended here, it does not appear in this whole description; and
   whether the word be translated, "the throat, mouth," or "roof of the
   mouth," as it may be either, they are all the instruments of the voice,
   and so may be expressive of it: moreover, nothing is more common with
   lovers, than to admire each other's voice; Christ was takes with the
   church's voice, and therefore desired to hear it, in chapter 2:14,
   saying, "Let me hear thy voice--for sweet is thy voice;" and no wonder
   then that the church should admire Christ's voice, and that it. should
   make such sweet music in her ears, as it seems from hence it did; his
   mouth or voice is most sweet; I am charmed with it: and so would you, O
   ye daughters of Jerusalem, did ye but hear it.

   The voice of the law is harsh and unpleasant; it pronounces guilty,
   curses and condemns; it is a voice of wrath and terror; it is a
   soul-cutting and soul-killing one; it is a voice of words, and of words
   that are not grateful; and therefore those who had once heard it,
   entreated that it might not be spoken to them any more: but the voice
   of Christ in the gospel is exceeding sweet, delightful and alluring;
   and no wonder it is so, for it is a voice of love, grace and mercy; it
   speaks peace and pardon, and brings the agreeable news of life and
   salvation by Christ to lost sinners; it is also the voice of the
   church's beloved, of him whom she loves with all her heart and soul,
   and therefore must needs be sweet unto her; it is what she is well
   acquainted with, perfectly knows, and can distinguish from a
   stranger's; nor is she ever more delighted than when under the sound of
   it; hence, in chapter 8:13, she says, as it is commonly understood, "O
   thou that dwellest in the gardens? where the companions hearken to thy
   voice," and are charmed and ravished with those warbling notes of
   thine, cause me also to hear it; for no concert of music whatever is
   equal to it.

   4thly, The word translated mouth, may be rendered taste, as it is in
   chapter 2:3, or rather, "the palate or roof of the mouth," which is the
   instrument of tasting, as it is in chapter 7:9, and as the roof of the
   church's mouth is there commended by Christ, why may not the roof of
   Christ's mouth be here commended by the church? Christ has a palate or
   taste, that, as Job says, chapter 6:30, can discern perverse things;
   distinguish between the precious and the vile, knows the difference
   between the good and bad, and can tell what food is best for his
   people, and what a portion of it is necessary for them; and therefore
   gives to every one of them their portion of meat in due season: he has
   a taste that disrelishes all carnal and earthly things, even in his own
   people, as well as others; that savors nothing but what is spiritual; a
   believer being a compound of flesh and spirit, the spiritual part of
   him savors the things of the spirit, and the carnal part the things of
   the flesh; but Christ having no flesh, no carnal part in him, savors
   nothing but the things of the spirit: hence he provides no food for his
   people but what is wholesome in itself, and savory to them; and they
   may very safely eat of it, when Christ, whose taste is most sweet, has
   prepared it for them, set it before them, and bid them welcome; nay
   more, he himself sits at the table, and sups with them, and they with
   him. And, "his taste is most sweet," that is, the taste of him is so;
   "Come, taste and see," says the Psalmist (Ps. 34:8), "that the Lord is
   good;" and every regenerate soul finds him so: Christ, and all of
   Christ, is sweet to a believer's taste, his person, grace, and
   righteousness; what he is in himself, and what he has done for his
   people, are all so; and hence the church could say, in chapter 2:3, by
   good experience, his fruit was sweet unto my taste. Or else,

   5thly, and lastly, By Christ's mouth may be meant, the breath of his
   mouth [739] : which being most sweet, wonderfully recommends him to the
   church's lave and affection. Job's breath was strange to his wife; but
   Christ is sweet to his people, nay, sweetness itself; and by it we may
   understand, either, 1. The expressions of Christ's love to his people:
   wicked men breathe out threatenings, cruelty, ruin, and destruction to
   God's children; but Christ breathes out nothing but love, grace and
   mercy: fury is not in him, but mercy is; for with the Lord is mercy,
   and with him is plenteous redemption; it is true, "the breath of the
   Lord is like a stream of brimstone," even an overflowing stream to
   destroy the wicked for with the breath of his lips shall he slay them;
   but it is like an overflowing stream of love, grace and mercy, which
   abounds and super-abounds towards his people in their everlasting
   salvation. Or, 2. It may be understood of Christ's mediation: the
   prayers of believers are called their breathing , in Lamentations 3:36.
   Christ's prayers, mediation and intercession, upon the account of his
   people, may bear the same name. Now this is most sweet, and is
   therefore compared to incense; it is sweet and acceptable unto God, and
   what sweetens and perfumes the saints sacrifices of prayer and praise;
   and hence it is, that the prayers of the saints are called odors (see
   Rev. 5:8, 8:3, 4). Though, 3. A late writer [740] thinks, that this may
   as well be referred to Christ's breathing upon his apostles, when he
   bid them receive the Holy Ghost; which was one of the finishing actions
   of his life on earth, as this is the finishing part of his description
   here: and indeed, Christ's breathing the gifts and graces of his Holy
   Spirit upon his apostles then, mad upon his churches and ministers in
   all ages since, he having the fullness of it with him, renders him
   exceeding amiable and lovely to them.

   II.She sums up the whole character, and doses the description of him,
   in saying, "Yea, he is altogether lovely; or, he is all desire" [741] ,
   as the Septuagint read it; or, "all desires," as it is in the Hebrew
   text: he is exceeding desirable to believers; there is none in heaven
   or in earth they desire besides him; and one of the characters which he
   was known by, under the Old Testament, was, "the desire of all nations.
   And now what makes him so desirable to the church and to all believers,
   are, The divine excellencies and perfections which appear in his
   person; for " in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily:
   there is no perfection or excellency in the Deity, but what may be
   found in Christ; and if so, there can be nothing that is excellent in
   any creature, either in heaven or earth, but what is eminently so in
   him; and therefore he must needs be a desirable person. 2. The
   mediatorial qualifications he is possessed of; he has a fullness of the
   gifts and graces of the Spirit in him, which qualify him as man end
   mediator for his office; he has a fullness of fitness for it, and a
   fullness of abilities to carry him through it; which render him a
   suitable and a desirable high-priest unto us. 3. The fullness of grace,
   life and salvation in him, makes him altogether desirable to souls;
   when they can see nothing in themselves, and all in Christ, an
   emptiness in the creature, and a fullness in him; that it is in vain to
   expect salvation elsewhere; but that there is enough in him to answer
   all their wants, present and future; every thing that will make them
   comfortable here, and happy hereafter; how can he be otherwise than
   exceeding desirable to them? 4. His agreeable carriage and deportment
   towards souls render him so; which is so wise and prudent, so loving,
   tender and compassionate, so week and humble, so courteous and affable,
   and attended with such an air of familiarity; that it at once fixes our
   eyes upon him, attracts our affections to him, and makes him all
   desires unto us. 5. The names and titles which he bears: he has a name
   that is above every name, which awes and commands our fear, being full
   of majesty; and he has a name which draws our love, being full of
   sweetness, which is that sweet and precious name Jesus; which is as
   ointment poured forth, and therefore do the virgins love him; and so
   are all those names which are given him, in Isaiah 9:6. 6. The
   characters he bears, and the relations he stands in to his people, make
   him exceeding desirable to them; and indeed, how can he be otherwise
   than so unto them, when he stands in the relations, and bears the
   characters of a tender husband, an indulgent father, a loving brother,
   and a faithful friend? He is all things to them [742] , even all in
   all.

   Again, if we read the words as they are translated in our bibles, "he
   is altogether lovely," we may observe, 1. That Christ, and all of
   Christ, is lovely to believers; he is so in his person, in all his
   offices, in his people, and in his ordinances; nay, the worst of
   Christ, or what may seem the most scaring and frightful to others, is
   lovely to the saints; as the cross of Christ, reproaches and sufferings
   on his account; for tho' they are not lovely in themselves, yet they
   are for his sake; and are therefore preferred by believers to the
   pleasures of sin, and profits of this world (see Heb. 11:25, 26). 2.
   That there is a perfect loveliness in Christ, every thing in him is
   lovely, and there is nothing lovely but what is in him; he is
   comprehensively so: if the church is a perfection of beauty, and is
   perfectly comely, "through the comeliness" which Christ has put upon
   her; he must needs be so from whom she has it, even "altogether
   lovely." 3. That he is so to all: he is lovely to his Father, as he is
   his own Son, the dear son of his love; and as he is man and mediator,
   engaged in our cause, as having assumed our nature, and obtained
   eternal redemption for us; he is so to all the holt angels, many of
   whom descended at his incarnation, and sang his praise, ministered to
   him in his state of humiliation, attended on him when tempted in the
   wilderness, and when in his agonies in the garden; and gazed with
   wonder and delight upon his glorious person, as they accompanied him in
   his ascension to glory: hence this is said to be one branch of the
   "great mystery of godliness," that God, who was "manifest in the flesh,
   was seen of angels," and appeared lovely to them: and so he is to all
   the saints, for "to them that believe, he is precious;" and indeed he
   is so to all but Christless sinners; who see no beauty, form nor
   comeliness in him, wherefore they should desire him. 4. As Christ is
   lovely in himself, and lovely to all others, so it is he that makes all
   the saints lovely to God: there is nothing in them, nor done by them,
   that can make them grateful to him; they are only accepted with him "in
   the beloved;" he is pleased with Christ and his righteousness, and with
   them as considered therein: he must needs be lovely, yea, "altogether
   lovely," that makes all the saints lovely too.

   Now the church having given such an ample description of her beloved to
   the daughters of Jerusalem, they might from henceforward cease to
   wonder, why she, who was "the fairest among women," was so deeply
   fallen in love with Christ; why she made such a stir about him, was so
   much concerned at his absence, was so diligent in her search of him,
   and gave them so strict a charge concerning him; as well as they need
   not now be any longer at a loss to know who and what he was, he having
   given such distinguishing characters of him; and having done this, she
   closes all with claiming an interest in him, and appropriates him to
   her own soul, in the latter part of this verse; she having a clear
   sight of him, and her faith more strengthened in him.

Chapter 5 Verse 16b

   Latter part.--This is my beloved, and this is my friend,
   O daughters of Jerusalem.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having given a large description of Christ, in the
   preceding verses, to the satisfaction of the inquiring daughters of
   Jerusalem; closes the account of him with a comfortable appropriation
   of him to her own soul, and a holy boasting of him before others; which
   she does, by considering him under those two characters:

   I.As her beloved.

   II.As her friend.

   I.She points him out to the daughters of Jerusalem, and distinguishes
   him from all other beloveds; and boasts of him in the views of her
   interest in him, under the character of her beloved: which shows, 1.
   That her love and affection to him were strong and ardent, such as many
   waters could not quench nor any thing separate from; though she was
   forsaken by him, and had suffered much from the watchmen and keepers of
   the wall for the sake of him; she had sought him with a great deal of
   care and diligence to little purpose; she had called aloud, and with
   great importunity herself, and had made use of the interest of others
   with him, and yet could not prevail upon him to show himself; she could
   neither see him, nor hear him, nor get any tidings of him; yet
   notwithstanding all this, he is her beloved still. 2. It bespeaks the
   strength of her faith in him; for notwithstanding the sense of sins and
   infirmities, which she now had, the desertions, temptations,
   sufferings, etc., which she was attended with, yet she could say, "This
   is my beloved:" this is the trial of faith, and herein lies the glory
   and excellency of it, when a soul can believe in the dark, or as
   Abraham did, believe "in hope against hope;" herein the church acted in
   some conformity to Christ, her head; who, when upon the cross, in the
   agonies of death, deserted by his friends, and forsaken by his God, yet
   nevertheless could say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" 3.
   This shows that Christ only was her beloved; that she had singled him
   out from all others; and that he was in her esteem preferable to all
   others: there is none among all the angels in heaven nor any among all
   the sons of men on earth, neither is there any creature enjoyment
   whatever, comparable to him; and it is as if she should say, Let others
   take their beloveds to themselves, the idols of their own hearts, their
   carnal lusts and sensual pleasures whom they have chose; for my part, I
   ingenuously confess that this excellent person, whom I have just now
   described unto you, is only "my beloved;" him I have chose, and I
   desire no other; and now I leave you to judge whether there is any
   comparison between him and others [743] . But having met with his
   character already in this song, I shall not any longer insist on it
   now; but proceed,

   II.To consider the other character which she gives of him "this is my
   friend" [744] . There is a mutual friendship between Christ and
   believers; he calls them his friends, in 5:1 of this chapter, as the
   church calls him in this; and it is worthy of observation, that the
   very same characters of beloved and friend, which Christ gives to his
   church there, are given to him by his own church here; it being usual
   for therein this song to take up each other's words, and return them.
   This character of a friend, undoubtedly suits well with Christ; in
   opening of which, I shall endeavor, First, To give some instances and
   proofs of Christ's friendship to his people. Secondly, To show the
   transcendent excellency of this friend. And, Thirdly, Consider in what
   manner the church here delivers herself.

   First, it will be proper to give some instances of Christ's friendship
   to his church and people; from whence it will manifestly appear, that
   he justly deserves such a character. And, 1. His engaging as a surety
   for them, is a manifest indication of it; when our cause was desperate
   he engaged in it; when justice was ready to give the blow our
   transgressions deserved, he interposed and averted it, and took it upon
   himself; when he knew that we should run through all our stock, and
   become bankrupts, he became our bondsman, and engaged to pay the whole
   debt; when he saw that we should fall into the depths of sin and
   misery, he undertook to bring us out of them, cleanse us from all sin,
   clothe us with his righteousness, and safely conduct us to glory; and
   must not all this be esteemed a proof of Christ's friendship to us? 2.
   His dying for us is another: this is the greatest act of friendship
   among men, for one mart to die for another; "Greater love hath no man
   than this," says Christ (John 15:13), "that a man lay down his life for
   his friends;" but Christ has given a greater instance of friendship
   than this, in that he has laid down his life for his enemies; for "when
   we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his son;" O
   matchless love! Unparalleled friendship! 3. He has paid all our debts:
   our sins are called so in scripture, and a large score of them we have
   run; we owe "ten thousand talents" and have not one farthing to pay;
   and to prison we must have gone, "where we should have lain until we
   had paid the uttermost farthing," had not Christ engaged to do it;
   which he has actually done, by making satisfaction to law and justice;
   on the account of which, God the Father has cancelled the bond, crossed
   the debt-book, and discharged both sinner and surety; it was an act of
   friendship now to be bound for us, but still a greater to pay the whole
   debt. 4. He has purchased our persons, and procured all things needful
   for us; we are "not our own," but "are bought with a price;" which
   price is not "corruptible things, as silver and gold," but the
   "precious blood" of Christ Jesus, which he has shed for the ransom of
   us: for a king to give a large sum of money for the ransom of any of
   his subjects out of Algiers, or any other place of slavery, is an
   instance of his beneficence, humanity, and friendship to them; but was
   he to give himself a ransom for them, it would be an unheard-of one,
   but Christ has done this for his people, and thereby redeemed them from
   the slavery of the law, sin, Satan, and the world and not only this,
   but has washed them from their sins "in his own blood," stripped them
   of their "filthy garments," and clothed them with "change of raiment;"
   nay, has procured an inheritance for them, of which he now gives them
   the pledge and earnest, and ere long will put them into the full
   possession of it: and now, to do all this for persons who are entirely
   undeserving of it, is an instance of friendship indeed! 5. Not only so,
   but he is also gone to glory, to take possession of it in our name,
   room and stead; that so we may not be under any fear of losing it, nor
   of being by any means deprived of it; and in so doing, acts the part of
   a loving brother, a trusty co-heir, and faithful friend; as well as he
   is gone thither also to prepare a place for us, that it may be ready
   for us, when we, by his Spirit and grace, are made ready for that. 6.
   His acting the part of an intercessor and advocate for us with the
   Father, is another instance of his friendship; "he appears in the
   presence of God for us," presents our services and petitions to him;
   pleads for every blessing we stand in need of, for converting,
   pardoning, adopting, sanctifying, and glorifying grace, and answers all
   Satan's charges and accusations; and in so doing, shows himself
   friendly to us. 7. He supplies all our wants: he has all grace
   treasured up in his person for this purpose, and he does not withhold
   it from his people; but, at proper times, cheerfully and freely
   distributes it, according as their wants and necessities require; and
   this he does, not merely for their importunities sake, but because they
   are his friends; when disconsolate, he comforts them; when tempted, he
   succors them; when distressed, he relieves them; when hungry, he feeds
   them; when sick and wounded, he heals them, and discharges all the good
   offices of a friend unto them. 8. He shows his friendship to us, and
   maintains it by the kind and comfortable visits which he makes to us;
   for though he may absent himself for some time, yet he will not leave
   us comfortless, but will come and see us, and visit us with his
   salvation; which is such an astonishing piece of friendship, that we
   have reason to say as the Psalmist (Ps. 8:4), "What is man that thou
   art mindful of him? and the son of man that thou visitest him?" 9.
   Whenever he pays those visits, it is with such an air of freedom and
   familiarity, as renders them exceeding delightful, and justly entitles
   him to this character; it was his free, courteous, and affable
   deportment to men in the days of, by his flesh, which occasioned the
   Pharisee's way of reproach, to call him "a friend of publicans and
   sinners:" and so free and familiar are his converses with his people in
   a spiritual war; he talks with them, as one friend may with another; he
   walks with them, nay, he sits down at table with them, sups with them,
   and they with him. 10. He shows himself to be a friend unto them, and
   that he looks upon them to be his friends, by disclosing the secrets of
   his grace unto them; hence says he to his disciples, John 15:15. "I
   call you nor servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth;
   but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my
   Father, I have made known unto you:" he lay in his Father's bosom, and
   so was privy to all his secret thoughts, counsels, purposes and
   decrees, and makes a discovery of them to us, so far as is needful to
   advance our good and his glory; for "the secret of the Lord is with
   them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant," (Ps. 25:14).

   And lastly, his friendship appears in the good and wholesome counsel
   which he gives unto us; which being taken, is always useful, and
   infallibly succeeds, being given with the utmost wisdom and the
   greatest faithfulness; of which see an instance in Revelation 3:18.
   Nay, his reproofs for sin, as well as his advice in distress, are
   exceeding friendly, and ought to be taken so; for, as the wise man says
   (Prov. 27:5, 6), "Open rebuke is better than secret love; faithful are
   the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful." Thus
   much may suffice for some instances and proofs of Christ's friendship
   to his church and people. I come now,

   Secondly, To show the transcendent excellency of this friend; "this is
   my friend:" he is a nonsuch; there is none like him, nor to be compared
   with him; for, 1. He is a "friend that sticketh closer than a brother:"
   which may be expressive of that near union there is between Christ and
   believers; they are as if but one soul actuated them; and indeed but
   one spirit does, which is in Christ without measure, and in believers
   in measure; for "he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit:" Christ
   stands in a nearer relation than that of a brother to his church; he is
   her head and husband, her bosom-friend; she is "flesh of his flesh, and
   bone of his bone;" though all these relations fall short of fully
   expressing the nearness, strictness, and indissolubleness of this
   union. Or else, this character may intend that sympathy and affection
   which Christ bears to his people, in all their afflictions, sorrows,
   sufferings, temptations, desertions, sins and infirmities; as well as
   signify his close adherence to our cause; who having once undertook it,
   never left it till he had completed what he had engaged to do; all
   which shows the transcendent excellency of this friend, 2. He is a
   constant friend, one that "loves at all times;" he was a friend to us,
   when we were enemies to him; and merely by his love and acts of
   friendship to us, he overcame us, slew the enmity of our natures, and
   of enemies made us friends; and continues to be a friend to us in all
   the adversities and afflictions of life: when men are in prosperity,
   they have usually many friends; but when the day of adversity comes
   upon them, they soon forsake them: but Christ does not treat his people
   so; he is a friend to them in adversity, as well as in prosperity; he
   knows their souls then, when no body else will; he owns them for his
   own, and treats them as his friends, and so he will continue to do,
   even until death; and at that time wilt not fail to show himself
   friendly to them, no more than he will at the day of judgment, when he
   will publicly own them, before angels and men, to be his friends; set
   "the crown of righteousness" upon their heads, and give them an
   admittance into his Father's kingdom and glory. 3. He is a faithful
   friend; we may safely tell him all the secrets of our hearts, he will
   not betray us; we may trust him with our all, he will never fail us;
   and though the prophet says (Micah 7:5). "Trust not in a friend, and
   put not confidence in a guide;" yet we may safely trust in this our
   friend, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will be our almighty God, and our
   trusty and faithful friend and "guide, even unto death." 4. He is a
   rich friend; such an one is often useful and needful: a man may have a
   friend that has a heart to help him, but not in a capacity; but Christ,
   as he is heartily willing to help us, so he has an ability to do it; he
   is possessed of "unsearchable riches," and these he distributes among
   his friends; for it is from those "riches in glory," which are in
   Christ's hands, that all the wants of his people are supplied. 5. He is
   an everlasting friend: a man may have a friend, but this friend may
   die, and then all his dependence on him is gone; but Christ ever lives,
   and ever lives to be a friend unto his people; death parts the best
   friends, and puts them into an incapacity of serving each other; but
   there is no fear or danger of this in Christ, over whom death shall no
   more have the dominion. 6. He is an unchangeable friend; he is always
   the same, "yesterday, to-day, and for ever:" sometimes little things
   "separate chief friends," but nothing can separate Christ and
   believers; his mind never changes, his affections never cool, nor are
   the communications of friendship ever cut off; his ears are not open to
   every idle story, nor is he tempted to break off friendship with his
   people, by their unkindnesses and ingratitude unto him. But,

   Thirdly, A little to consider the manner in which the church delivers
   herself in these words; which appears to be, 1. In the strength of
   faith: she could comfortably appropriate Christ to herself, under each
   of the characters here mentioned; and though she had not the sensible
   manifestations of Christ's love to her, which she was desirous of, and
   had not those visible instances of his friendship she had formerly
   experienced, yet she did not doubt but that he was both her beloved and
   her friend. 2. She seems to speak in an exulting and rejoicing manner;
   her soul was filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory, as an
   effect of her faith in an unseen Jesus; and indeed she had all the
   reason in the world to rejoice in the views of her interest in such a
   beloved, and in such a friend, whom she had before described. 3. She
   seems also to speak in a kind of boasting manner, "This is my beloved,
   and this is my friend:" and indeed believers may do so, for though they
   may not glory in themselves, nor in any thing done by them, yet they
   may in Christ, and in what he has done for them: and so the Psalmist
   David did, (Ps. 34:2), who says, "My soul shall make her boast of the
   Lord:" and thus the church did here before the daughters of Jerusalem,
   and what effect this whole discourse of hers had upon them, may be seen
   in the following words.

   The discourse between the church and the daughters of Jerusalem is
   continued in this chapter: they inquire whither her beloved was gone,
   in order to seek him with her, verse 1 she tells them where he was
   gone, and for what purpose he went thither, and what he. Was doing
   there; and claims and asserts her interest in him, verses 2,3. Then
   follows a commendation of the church by Christ; who admires her beauty,
   and describes her by her eyes, hair, etc., verses 4-7, and prefers her
   to all others, being a singular and choice one to him, and being
   praised by others, verses 8-10, and next he gives an account of his
   going into his garden, and of his design in it, and of what happened to
   him there, verses 11,12. And the chapter is concluded with a charge to
   the Shulamite to turn herself, that she might be looked upon; which
   occasions a question, to which an answer is returned, verse 13.

Chapter 6 Verse 1

   Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among, women?
   Whither it thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word church having answered the former question of the daughters
   of Jerusalem to their satisfaction, by giving them an ample account of
   her beloved, what he was; they proceed to another question, and ask,
   whither he was gone, which we have in this verse. In which may be
   considered,

   I.The title or appellation they give her, or their manner of addressing
   her, "O thou fairest among women."

   II.A question proposed by them to her, which is also repeated; "Whither
   is thy beloved gone? whither is thy beloved turned aside?"

   III.The end of their asking this question; "that we may seek him with
   thee?"

   I.The title or appellation which they give her, is, the "fairest among
   women:" which is, no doubt, designed to express the exceeding greatness
   of her beauty; women being the fairest of human race, and she the
   fairest of all that sex; she was in their eye the "perfection of
   beauty," and therefore they give her this character; and they were not
   mistaken in it, for Christ gives her the very same encomium, and that
   in the same words, in chapter 1:8. But now we must not understand this
   of her, as considered in herself; neither did the daughters of
   Jerusalem so understand it, who had been better informed from her own
   mouth; for she had told them, that she was black in herself, though
   comely in Christ: nor is it to be understood of her outward appearance
   in the world: for under that consideration she appears also black with
   reproaches, scandals, persecutions and afflictions: but this character
   suits her as she is considered in Christ, her head; as justified by his
   righteousness, washed in his blood, and .sanctified by his Spirit. It
   may also be observed, that these persons continued in their esteem of
   her; for the same character they give her here, they gave her when they
   proposed the first question to her, in chapter 5:9, nay, perhaps their
   esteem of her, and value for her, might rise higher than heretofore,
   they having a clearer knowledge of Christ than they had before; for as
   our knowledge of Christ and love to him increase, so do our love unto,
   and our esteem for his people: and it is very probable, that the beauty
   and loveliness which they saw in her, drew their pity and compassion
   towards her; so as to take notice of her case, condole her misfortunes
   in the loss of so excellent a person, and offer their service to assist
   her in the search of him. Likewise, no doubt but the veneration and
   esteem which they had for her person, made them more carefully attend
   to what she said concerning her beloved: for thus it is with persons
   under the preaching of the gospel; if they come prejudiced against the
   person who ministers, they take but little notice of what is said,
   unless it be to calumniate and reproach, and so reap but little
   advantage from it; when, on the other hand, if persons come, not only
   unprejudiced against, but having a veneration and respect for the
   minister of the gospel, they generally give the greater heed unto, and
   are most likely to profit by his ministrations.

   Moreover, the daughters might make use of this title or appellation in
   their addresses, to assure her that they were serious and in good
   earnest in asking this question, as well as in the former; and that it
   was not to indulge a vain curiosity in themselves, nor designed for her
   disadvantage, but rather the contrary.

   II.Here is a question put by them; "Whither is thy beloved gone?" [745]
   Which way did he take? what course did he steer? on which hand did he
   turn, when he withdrew from thy door? which question is repeated,
   though another word [746] is used, yet to the same purpose, "Whither is
   thy beloved turned aside?" Which way did he look? which way did he turn
   his face, when he turned it from thee? Now, 1. The putting of this
   question, and not insisting any longer upon the former, or upon the
   explication of any branch of her answer to it, supposes that they were
   entirely satisfied with it; therefore the question is not now, who or
   what her beloved was, for they knew that full well from the description
   she had given of him but now the question is, "Whither is he gone?"
   This may teach us, that when younger Christians have any doubts,
   scruples, cases of conscience, or questions relating to faith or
   experience; to the person, office, and grace of Christ, or to any part
   of the great mystery of godliness, to be resolved, they should make
   their application to elder ones: this method these young converts, or
   daughters of Jerusalem, took here; which God was pleased to bless and
   succeed, for their increase in light and knowledge, and for the
   stirring up of their affections and desires after the Lord Jesus: and
   may serve to encourage the private conferences and conversations of the
   saints with each other: which, when carried on in an agreeable manner,
   when filled with spiritual discourses, and taken up with asking and
   answering proper questions relating to faith or experience, are highly
   well pleasing to God, and tend much to the edifying of one another:
   this may also serve as a direction to ministers to insist chiefly upon
   the glories and excellencies of Christ; for this is the way of
   preaching which God owns and blesses, for the conversion of sinners,
   and consolation of saints; the church's insisting on this subject, was
   made of great use to these persons, to draw out their love to Christ,
   and to make farther inquiries after him. 2. It may be observed from
   this question, that when Christ is known, who he is, and what he is;
   the next question is, where he is, and how he may be come at? whilst
   persons are insensible of their wretched state by nature, they see no
   need of Christ; and whilst they are ignorant of him, they have no value
   for him, nor desire after him; ignoti nulla cupido; there is no desire
   after an unknown thing; an unknown Christ is an undesired Christ: the
   reason why souls, in a state of nature, seek not after God is, because
   they have no understanding of him: "there is none that understandeth,"
   says the apostle (Rom. 3:11), "there is none that seeketh after God:"
   the same reason holds here, with respect to Christ; for, whilst souls
   remain strangers to the beauties and glories of Christ's person, they
   will have no value for him, nor make any inquiry after him; but as for
   those that know the Lord, they will "follow on to know him," and make
   use of all means appointed for that purpose; for the more a soul knows
   of Christ, the more it desires to know; mere speculative notions of his
   person, without knowledge of interest in him, and communion with him,
   will not satisfy them an account of him by hearsay, though exceeding
   ravishing and delightful to them, is not enough without seeing him; for
   where Christ's worth is once known, there is no contentment without the
   enjoyment of him; when he is once discovered as "the pearl of price,"
   the soul is willing to run all risks, endure all hardships, part with
   every thing that is near and dear, so it may but be possessed of him:
   its language is, Give me Christ, or I die; ten thousand worlds, if I
   had them, for an interest in this glorious person: this seems to be the
   case of the daughters of Jerusalem here. 3. The repetition of this
   question, shows that they were serious and in good earnest, and did not
   speak sarcastically: [747] and that they were impatient until they
   received an answer; "Whither is thy beloved gone? whither is thy
   beloved turned aside?" prithee give us an answer speedily, keep us not
   in suspense; thou hast given us such a character of his person, that we
   long to see him, and are uneasy until thou givest us some notice of the
   place whither he is retired, that we may, along with thee, be searching
   after him. 4. There may be some knowledge of Christ, love to him, and
   desires after him, when there is but little faith in him that is
   discernible; all the graces of the Spirit are implanted at one and the
   same time, but they do not all appear at once in their actings upon
   Christ; love and affection to Christ, and desires after him, appear
   before faith does: so they did in these persons: they had got some
   farther knowledge of Christ from the church's description of him; were
   filled with greater love and affection to him, and had more ardent
   desires after him, and yet had but little faith in him; for they could
   not say, that he was their beloved; and therefore, as one [748] well
   observes, they do not say, where is our beloved gone, but where is thy
   beloved gone? 5. It appears that they were willing to take the least
   hints, nay even conjectures, that if it was possible, they might
   improve them towards finding him, "Whither is thy beloved gone?" Canst
   thou not give us some hints of it I canst thou not guess which way he
   took? which shows how intent they were of using all means, so that they
   might but find him; let it be which way it would, they. were resolved
   to pursue it; could they but have the least notice of it, whether it
   was to the right-hand or left, backwards or forwards. 6. Their putting
   this question to her, shows that she was, or at least that they thought
   she was, capable of giving them some directions, though she was at the
   same time destitute of his presence; and it seems she was, by the
   answer she gives them in the following verse. The church knew where
   Christ usually retired, and granted his gracious presence to his
   people; and though he was not willing, at present, to show himself to
   her, yet she did not know but he might to them, and therefore directs
   them; nay, sometimes believers are capable of advising and directing
   others, when they cannot take advice themselves.

   III.The end they propose in asking this question, is, that they might
   seek him with her: which may be considered as a motive to prevail upon
   her to comply with their request; for this shows that they were serious
   and in good earnest; that their end was not mere speculation, but
   practice, which indeed ought to be the end of all our inquiries; that
   it was their purpose and resolution to seek him; they had agreed and
   resolved among themselves to do it; for so the words may be read, "and
   we will seek him with thee;" [749] and if thou wilt tell us which way
   he went, it will lay us under an obligation to make good our
   resolution: nay, it shows also that it was her good they had in view,
   as much as their own; and self-interest goes a great way; so that, put
   all together, it is no wonder that she readily, and without any
   hesitation, answers the question. Now this being the frame of soul that
   these daughters of Jerusalem were brought into through her discourse
   concerning Christ; and seeking Christ being the thing which they had in
   view, and were desirous of being directed in; may lead us to observe
   the following things: 1. That the end of setting forth the excellencies
   of Christ, whether in private conversation, or in the public ministry,
   is to set souls a seeking after him; for this purpose the ministers of
   the gospel insist upon the glories of Christ's person, the excellency
   of his righteousness, the efficacy of his blood, and the fullness of
   his grace; it was with this view that the church took so much pains,
   and spent so much time, in discoursing concerning this excellent
   person, her beloved, which had its answerable success. 2. It is very
   discouraging to seek Christ, and not know where he is; it is true, the
   church knew where Christ used to retire, when he withdrew himself, and
   therefore knew where to seek him, in hopes of finding him; but the
   daughters of Jerusalem were unacquainted therewith; and therefore it
   was very proper for them to put such a question, previous to their
   seeking, him. 3. This should be the principal thing we should have in
   view in all religious duties, seeking and seeing Jesus; this is that
   one thing that should be uppermost in our hearts and desires, when
   concerned in the duties of hearing, reading, praying, meditating and
   conferring, that we may "behold the king in his beauty." 4. Our seeking
   Christ should be jointly and together; we should seek him, not
   separately, but with the church: though this does not exclude our
   seeking him alone, in our closets and in our families; yet there is a
   social part of worship that we should be concerned in jointly; in which
   we are to worship the Lord with one shoulder and one consent, and "not
   forsake the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some too
   often is. 5. We should seek Christ in his ordinances, and where his
   church seeks him: we cannot expect the presence of Christ, when we run
   away from his church and ordinances, or when we seek him elsewhere; we
   should seek him with the church, and where the church seeks. 6. Their
   saying that they would seek him with her, was no doubt to encourage her
   in hopes of finding; they do as good as desire her not to be cast down
   at his departure; for they hoped he was not gone far, and that he would
   be found again, and at the same time promise her all the assistance
   they were capable of giving; though there is also reason to believe,
   that they were in hopes of sharing with her in so valuable a blessing;
   and indeed it was but reasonable, that if they bore part with her in
   the fatigue of the search, they should also participate with her in the
   enjoyment of the blessing; which no doubt she was willing to, and
   therefore immediately gives the following answer.

Chapter 6 Verse 2

   My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices,
   toiled in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words contain the church's answer to the second question of
   the daughters of Jerusalem; they had asked her what her beloved was
   more than others; she told them: they then proceed to ask, whither he
   was gone; to which she here replies. In which may be considered,

   I.The place whither she says he was gone; "my beloved is gone down into
   his garden, to the beds of spices."

   II.The end of his going down, or what his business and employment was
   when there; which was twofold: 1st, "To feed in the gardens." 2dly, "To
   gather lilies."

   I.The place whither she says he was gone, "into his garden;" and more
   particularly, "to the beds of spices." And,

   1st, It may be inquired what was meant by his garden, into which he was
   gone down. Same [750] understand it of the heavenly paradise, whither
   Christ was gone to share the everlasting joys thereof, and converse
   with angels and saints; who may be said to be the "trees of
   righteousness," those spicy plants and precious flowers which are
   planted there; and in the midst of which stands "the tree of life,"
   Christ Jesus, the glory of the whole garden; and into this, Christ's
   lilies, when fully ripe, are transplanted by him. This sense is favored
   by R. Aben Ezra's gloss upon the text, who says, "This is he who
   ascended on high," to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies,
   "because he dwelleth with the angels, who are the righteous ones." But
   if the words design Christ's ascension into heaven, they should rather
   have expressed thus; "my beloved is gone up into his garden," than as
   they are, "my beloved is gone down into his garden:" therefore I rather
   think, that the church of Christ here on earth is meant; which is as a
   garden separated by Christ from this world, whose enclosure is
   sovereign and distinguishing grace; in which are various trees, plants
   and spices, set and planted there by Christ himself, and where he takes
   his walks with pleasure; but in what sense the church may be compared
   to a garden, see more on chapter 4:12.

   2dly, It may be observed, that this garden is said to be his; and so it
   may very well; for of all others he has chosen this to be his garden;
   he asked it of his Father for this purpose, and he gave it him; he has
   also purchased it by his own blood, and distinguished it by his grace;
   he takes the care of it, waters it, and watches over it; it is he that
   hath brought it to its present perfection, and will bring it to a far
   greater; so that Christ retires and takes his walks here, not as one
   either upon trespass or sufferance, and by the leave of others; but as
   having an undoubted right and title to it, and as being sovereign lord
   and owner of it; but of this, see more on chapter 4:16.

   3dly, Christ is said to be gone down into his garden: which perhaps may
   be an allusion to Solomon's gardens, which lay lower than his palace:
   and it is probable that those stairs, which went down from the city of
   David, the palace royal of the kings of Judah, were made to go down
   into the king's gardens, of both which you read in Nehemiah 2:15, and
   so "the garden of nuts," in verse 11. seems to be in the valley: or the
   allusion may be to what Solomon himself was wont to do, as Josephus
   [751] relates; who used to go very early in a morning, in great pomp,
   to Etham, about two miles from Jerusalem, a pleasant place, abounding
   with gardens and flows of water, which might lie lower than Jerusalem.
   And in the spiritual or mystical sense, may point out, 1. The low
   estate of Christ's church here on earth: the saints are compared to
   myrtle-trees; and these are said (Zech. 1:8), to be "in the bottom,"
   that is, in a low estate, being depressed with many sorrows,
   afflictions, and persecutions; they are doves, but "doves of the
   rallies," mourning under a sense of their iniquities, being burdened
   with the weight of sin; and they are not only in a low estate, but also
   low and humble in their own eyes: and with such Christ delights to
   dwell; he often goes down into his garden to those humble souls, pays
   them a visit, grants them his presence, and bestows larger measures of
   his grace upon them. 2. It is also expressive of Christ's condescension
   in doing this: It was a wonderful stoop, and an amazing instance of his
   condescension, to come down from heaven, clothe himself with our
   nature, and converse with sinful mortals here on earth; for a king to
   come from his royal palace, and enter into the cottage of a beggar, and
   to eat, drink, and lodge there for a time, would not express so much
   humility and condescension as this does; and next to this is his
   granting his presence to his churches, and to particular believers here
   on earth; so that we have reason to say, when we consider the greatness
   of his majesty, and our vileness, sinfulness and unworthiness, with
   Judas, not Iscariot. "How is it, Lord, that thou wilt manifest thyself
   to us, and not unto the world?" (John 14:22). And if,

   4thly, It should be asked, How she could tell the daughters of
   Jerusalem where her beloved was, when she was at a loss for him, and in
   the search of him herself? it may be answered, 1. That though she had
   sought hires and found him not; though he was not pleased to manifest
   himself to her at that present time; yet having had large experiences
   of these things, she knew where Christ usually was, and would be found
   of his people; therefore she directs them where formerly she had,
   though now she could not find him, in hopes that they might. Or, 2. It
   may be supposed that the case was altered with her, that she was no
   longer at a loss for him; but having sought him, had found him, or at
   least had got some intelligence of him; which she no sooner had, but
   she informs them of it. Or, 3. Their inquiring whither he was gone,
   might bring to her remembrance what she had formerly heard him say, in
   chapter 5:1. "I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse," etc. but
   falling asleep immediately, entirely forgot it, until her memory was
   refreshed by the inquiries of these persons. Thus you see that weaker
   Christians may be useful to stronger ones; and even the very questions
   they put for information-sake, may prove the quickening of believers,
   and be the means of increasing light and knowledge, or at least; of
   reviving past experiences. But,

   5thly, It may be observed, that she not only says that he was gone down
   to his garden, but that he was gone down "to the beds of spices:" by
   which I understand particular believers, who are so many beds in
   Christ's garden; in which ate planted those precious spices, the graces
   of the Spirit, which, for rareness, excellency and fragrancy, are
   called so: and these more especially intend growing, thriving and
   flourishing souls; lively believers, whose spices flow out," whose
   grace is in exercise; such Christ has a particular regard unto, and
   delights to be with.

   II.She declares the end of his going down into his garden, or what it
   is he employs himself about when there. And,

   1st, She says, it was "to feed in the gardens." By gardens, I
   understand particular congregated churches; [752] for though there is
   but one "general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are
   written in heaven;" which is redeemed by Christ's blood, and will be
   presented "a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such
   thing," and therefore before called a garden, in the singular number;
   yet there are many distinct and particular churches; such as those of
   Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Colosse, Philippi, Thessalonica, and
   the seven churches of Asia, were; which were as so many distinct
   gardens, or plots of earth, that the one garden was subdivided into.
   And by feeding, here, is meant, either, 1. His feeding himself; [753]
   which as to be understood of that pleasure and delight which Christ
   takes in being among his saints, and seeing their graces exercised upon
   their proper object; for as believers feed themselves by exercising
   their grace on Christ, so he feeds or delights himself in observing
   this; this is his meat and drink; this is his supping with them, as the
   other is their supping with him; and this Christ is invited to, in
   chapter 4:16, to which he complies, in chap. 5:1. Or else, 2. It may be
   understood of his feeding his flock, as R. Sol. Jarchi observes; for
   "he feeds his flock like a shepherd," though in such places as other
   shepherds do not; he feeds them in the gardens, which are unusual to
   feed sheep in; commons or enclosed grounds, and not gardens, being the
   most usual places for that purpose: and she makes mention of gardens,
   in the plural number, to show that Christ is not tied to one particular
   church, but feeds in all his churches, in all his gardens; where he
   feeds his people with himself, who is "the bread of life, the hidden
   manna;" whose flesh is meat indeed, and whose blood is drink indeed: O
   precious food! delicious fare! he feeds them by and with his
   ordinances, which are those "breasts of consolation" which convey much
   strength and nourishment to them; those green pastures into which he
   leads them, and "the fatness of his house" with which he feeds them;
   and particularly the Lord's Supper is that "feast of fat things," by
   which he sweetly refreshes them; he feeds them also by his ministers,
   who are his under-shepherds, to whom he has given a commission and also
   ability, to feed his people "with knowledge and with understanding:"
   and so he does likewise by his Spirit; who takes the things of Christ,
   and sheds it in us; and the promises of Christ, and applies them to us;
   for which reason he is called "the spirit of promise." And now this may
   serve to direct poor hungry souls where to go for food, and where to
   expect it, even in Christ's gardens, in his churches and in his
   ordinances, where he himself feeds.

   2dly, Another end of his going down into his garden, is "to gather
   lilies or roses, as the Targum renders it; to crop them with the hand;
   [754] lilies are liable to be cropped; hence Horace [755] calls the
   lily, breve lilium, the short-lived lily: by which may be meant, either
   the good works of the saints, which he is well pleased with, and takes
   notice of; insomuch that he writes them down in "the book of his
   remembrance," as R. Solomon Jarchi observes; for he "is not unrighteous
   to forget their work, and labor of love," but will reward them in a way
   of grace: or else, by them is meant, the sweet-smelling graces of his
   own Spirit, growing in his churches, as Ainsworth thinks, with which he
   is wonderfully delighted: or rather, the persons of the elect, and
   members of his church, who may be compared to lilies, for the glory,
   splendor, and beauty in his righteousness; of which see chapter 2:2.
   Now there was, 1. A gathering of these lilies at Christ's death: as all
   the Sins of the elect were collected together and were laid on Christ,
   when he hung upon the cross; so all their persons were collected and
   gathered together in one head, Christ Jesus; they all met in his
   person, and were represented by him; for this purpose Christ came down
   from heaven, took our nature, and suffered in it (see John 11:51, 52;
   Eph. 1:10). 2. There is a gathering of these lilies in effectual
   calling, through the ministry of the word, by the mighty power of
   divine grace; and this work Christ is daily concerned in, in his
   church, and will be until all his elect are gathered in. 3. There is a
   gathering of them into church-communion, which is also Christ's work;
   who takes "one of a city, and two of a family," and brings them to
   Zion; and in doing this, he shows his regard to the good of souls, and
   at the same time "glorifies the house of his glory," (see Isa. 60:7,
   8). 4. There is a gathering into nearer communion with himself, which
   he often does after great desertions (see Isa. 54:7). 5. This may be
   expressive of that great delight and pleasure which Christ takes in his
   people: no man can take more delight in plucking fruit, or gathering
   flowers in a garden, than Christ does in his own people, and in his own
   grace in them (see Song 5:1). 6. This may be meant of their being
   gathered by death; so Abraham and Isaac, when they died, are said to be
   "gathered unto their fathers," (Gen. 15:8, 35:29). Christ comes into
   his garden, the church, sometimes to plant new lilies, and sometimes to
   crop and gather old ones, when they are fully ripe; not to destroy
   them, but to remove them into his paradise above; and at the last day,
   by the means of angels, he will gather in all his elect ones from the
   four winds, as wheat into his barn, and as lilies into his garden (see
   Matthew 3:7, 13:48, 24:31). This sense of the word is given by several
   Jewish writers. [756] And now, lest any should think that this was a
   mere surmise, conjecture, and imagination of hers; or if any should
   call in question her knowledge in this matter, she declares in the
   following verse, that she was not only well acquainted with him, but
   was nearly related to him; and therefore was capable of informing any
   person where he was, and what he was about.

Chapter 6 Verse 3

   I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine:

   he feedeth among the lilies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words are expressive of that mutual interest and
   property which Christ and his church have in each other, of that strict
   and inseparable union that there is between them, and also of that
   mutual affection and complacency which they have to and in each other,
   as well as of her knowledge and assurance of her interest in Christ,
   has been shown on chapter 2:16, but it may be farther observed, that
   the order of the words is here inverted; that whereas in chapter 2:16,
   the order of the words is this, "My beloved is mine, and I am his;"
   from whence has been observed, that Christ is first ours, and then we
   are his, which is an undoubted truth; for Christ first gives himself to
   us, before we are capable of giving ourselves to him; but that which
   was first there is here last, and what was last is first; for she first
   says, "I am my beloved's; and then, "my beloved is mine:" from whence
   it may be observed, that though Christ is first ours in fact, yet our
   being his, may come first to our knowledge, may be first in discovery;
   that is to say, that we may know that he has called us by his grace,
   and enabled us thereby to give up ourselves to him: so that we can say,
   Lord, we are thine, thou hast conquered our souls by thy grace, and
   hast taken possession of us, which thou wouldest never have done, had
   we not been thine; and from this work of grace upon our souls, we
   conclude that thou art ours. Thus the cause may be known by the effect;
   and our interest in Christ, by the displays of Christ's grace to us,
   and in us; likewise, if we consider the words as connected with her
   former carriage and behavior to Christ, and what she had met with from
   him, they will lead us to observe; that all the infirmities, sins, and
   miscarriages of God's people, do not destroy their union with, and
   interest in Christ Jesus: she had treated him very rudely, when he, in
   the most moving manner, and with the most tender language, entreated
   her to arise and let him in; she put him off with idle excuses, which
   he so much resented, as to absent himself from her, and left her to
   seek him in vain,, and to be abused by the watchmen and keepers of the
   walls; and though he thus visited her transgressions with this rod of
   correction, his own absence, for that is so to God's children; and with
   those stripes and blows which she received from the watchmen; yet he
   did not take away his loving-kindness from her, nor break his covenant
   with her; and she was satisfied of this, and therefore could say,
   notwithstanding all this, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine;"
   and if, with R. Aben Ezra, we connect the words with the preceding
   verse, there will appear a beauty and glory in them, "My beloved is
   gone down into his garden," etc. It is true, he is so; but though he is
   gone, and I am left alone, he is departed from me, and when he will
   return, I cannot tell; perhaps I may never see his face more here on
   earth, in a way of sensible communion and fellowship with him, as I
   have heretofore done, though I hope I shall; yet if I never do, I am
   satisfied as to my covenant-interest in him, and union to him; I know
   that I am my beloved's, and that my beloved is mine; here lies the
   glory and excellency of faith, thus to believe in an unseen Christ:
   though it may be, as the Targum intimates, that she had now the
   presence of Christ, the glorious Shekinah, with her; he had once more
   shewn himself to her, and, upon the sight of him, she says, as Thomas
   did, my Lord, and my God: but however, whether she had or had not the
   visible tokens of Christ's presence, her faith was certainly in
   exercise upon him; nay, she had not only faith, but the joy of faith;
   she not only knew her interest in Christ, as her salvation, but also
   had the joys of this salvation restored to her. And again it may be
   observed, that tho' she excludes all other beloveds from having any
   share in her affections, or from being in competition with him; yet by
   saying what she does, she does not exclude others, particularly the
   daughters of Jerusalem, from having an interest in him, as well as she,
   as R. Sol. Jarchi thinks; who paraphrases the words thus, "I am my
   beloved's, and ye are not his, and therefore shall not build with us,"
   and then explains it by Ezra 4:3, but though the church knew that a
   whole Christ was hers, yet she knew that he was others also; and would
   therefore never say so to the daughters of Jerusalem, to discourage
   them in seeking of him.

   Moreover she adds, as in chapter 2, "he feedeth among the lilies:"
   which may be considered, either as an apostrophe to him, "O thou that
   feedest among the lilies;" or as descriptive both of him and of the
   place where he was; that others might, readily know where her beloved
   was, and where he was to be found: but of this we have spoken, on
   chapter 2:16, and shall not here repeat it; only observe, that Christ
   having been a long time absent from his church, and would not make
   himself known, nor speak one word a great while, at last breaks
   silence, and, like another Joseph, cannot refrain himself any longer
   from her; but must make himself known to her, and bursts out with words
   of love and joy, in the following commendations of her.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 6 Verse 4

   Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah;
   comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are the words of Christ; who, having absented himself from
   his church for a considerable time, to show his resentment of her
   former carriage to him, now manifests himself unto her, and declares
   that he has the same love and affection for her as ever he had, and
   therefore addresses her with this title or character, "O my love!" nay,
   that she was as beautiful and comely in his eye as ever she was,
   notwithstanding all her failings and infirmities; which beauty of hers
   he describes first more generally in this verse, and then more
   particularly in the following ones. In this general description of her
   beauty are three parts: "that she is as beautiful as Tirzah."

   I.He says,

   II."Comely as Jerusalem."

   III."Terrible as an army with banners."

   I.He declares her to be as "beautiful as Tirzah." The Septuagint do not
   take it to be the proper name of a place, as we, with R. Aben Ezra, do,
   and therefore translate the word, and render it thus, wJv eudokia, as
   good-will or good-pleasure; which may be expressive of the sweetness of
   her temper and disposition, which is heightened by using the abstract;
   she was all over good-will and good-nature, not only sweet, but
   sweetness itself, as she says of him, in chapter 5:16. Moreover, this
   may be spoken of her, as she is the object of God's good-will and
   pleasure; and so she appears to be, as chosen in Christ by him, to be a
   partaker of grace and glory with him; which was not done upon the foot
   of works, but by an act of his sovereign good-will and pleasure, who
   "will have mercy on whom he will have mercy:" also, as she is redeemed
   by Christ: in which there was such a discovery of "the exceeding riches
   of God's grace," such an appearance of his "goodwill to men," that the
   angels could not but take notice of it, when they celebrated with a
   song the birth of an incarnate Savior (Luke 2:14). likewise, as called
   and sanctified by the blessed Spirit of grace, who "worketh in us both
   to will and to do of his good pleasure." And now if we thus consider
   the church as the object of God's good-will and pleasure, in those
   several instances of it, she will appear beautiful and lovely. Or else,
   this may be said of her, as she is filled with good-will to God, to
   Christ, his people, gospel, worship, ways and ordinances: the church
   and all true believers in Christ bear a good-will to God; they "love
   him, because he first loved them;" they love him, not only for what he
   is unto them, and what he has done for them, but also for what he is in
   himself: for he is in his own nature, in his own perfections, amiable
   and lovely: they bear a good-will to Christ, he is altogether lovely to
   them; they have none in heaven but him, nor as there any on earth they
   desire besides him; every thing that belongs to him is exceeding
   precious to them: "his name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do
   the virgins love him;" they bear a good-will to his people, who have
   his image enstamped upon them, and to his gospel, which they prefer to
   their necessary food; and to his worship, ways and ordinances; they
   love the habitation of his house; his tabernacles are amiable; his ways
   are ways of pleasantness; his commands are not grievous, but exceeding
   delightful to them. Now if we consider the church :as being of this
   sweet and loving disposition, which is wrought, influenced and
   maintained by divine grace, how beautiful does she appear!

   Again, the word Tirzah comes from a root, which signifies to be
   grateful, or to be accepted; and so R. Solomon Jarchi paraphrases the
   words, "Thou art beautiful, O my love, seeing that thou art acceptable
   to me;" and so he says it is explained in an ancient book of theirs,
   called Siphre: [757] and if we take the words in this sense, they set
   forth the beauty and glory of the church, as she stands before God, "
   accepted in Christ the beloved." God is well pleased with Christ, and
   with the church in him; he is well pleased for his righteousness sake,
   and with her as she appears in that; for so considered, she is a
   complete beauty, fair and without spot, lovely to look upon, delightful
   to Christ, and acceptable to God.

   The Targum paraphrases the words thus, "How beautiful art thou, O my
   love, in the time it is thy will to do my pleasure. Our righteousnesses
   are indeed as filthy rags, and we ourselves as an unclean thing;" yet
   when we are made "willing in the day of God's power," to act according
   to his will, and that in faith, from a principle of love, and with an
   eye to his glory; it is accepted by him, the same way as our persons
   are. But I see no reason why we should not take the word as the proper
   name of a place; seeing it is certain that there was such a city as
   Tirzah, in the land of Judea, which was a very pleasant and delightful
   place, as its name manifestly shows; for which reason, no doubt, it was
   made choice of by one of the ancient kings of Canaan, to be the place
   of his residence (see Josh. 12:24), as it was afterwards by Jeroboam
   and his successors, until Zimri's time: who, when the city was taken,
   burnt the king's house with fire. Now either for its pleasant
   buildings, or beautiful situation, or some such tiring, the church is
   here compared unto it, being arrayed with Christ's righteousness, and
   adorned with the graces of his Spirit. But,

   II.Lest this should not be sufficient to commend her beauty, he says
   also, that she is as "comely as Jerusalem;" which was not only the
   chief city in Judea's land, but as Pliny [758] says, was the most
   famous of all the cities in the east; nay more, it was "the joy of the
   whole earth:" the church goes under this name, both in the Old and New
   Testament; for which, see the following texts, Isaiah 40:2 and 52:1;
   Galatians 4:25,26; Hebrews 12:22; Revelation 21:2. Now she may be said
   to be "comely as Jerusalem," for the following reasons: 1. Jerusalem
   was a well-built city, its houses were closely joined together, and its
   streets uniform; hence the Psalmist says (Ps. 122:3), "Jerusalem is
   builded as a city that is compact together:" so the church of Christ,
   and the members of it, as they are built upon the same foundation, and
   are closely joined to the same head, Christ; so they are strictly
   united one to another, and are like "a building fitly framed together,"
   or like an human body that is "fitly joined together, and compacted by
   that which every joint supplieth;" all the members being set in their
   proper places, in a just symmetry with, and subserviency to each other
   (see Eph. 2:20, 21, 4:16). 2. Jerusalem was not only the metropolis of
   Judea, but was the chief city in all the world, as has been observed:
   and this may set forth the super-excellency, glory and comeliness of
   the church, above all the world besides; which will more manifestly
   appear, when "the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in
   the top of the mountains, and be exalted above the hills, and God's
   Jerusalem be a praise in the earth," (see Isa. 2:2, 62:7). 3. It was a
   very beautiful city; [759] it had many beautiful structures in it,
   particularly the temple, which was the finest building that ever was
   seen in the world; it was also very beautiful for situation, as well as
   for buildings, and therefore was called the perfection of beauty; as
   the church also is, being beautified with the garments of Christ's
   salvation. 4. It was a very rich and opulent city; especially in
   Solomon's time who "made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones:" in the
   church, not only the unsearchable riches of Christ, are preached, but
   also the immense riches of divine grace and mercy are expended upon the
   members of it; so that every inhabitant of this Jerusalem is a king and
   a prince: How rich must that city be, all whose inhabitants are kings
   and princes? such are the saints, the members of Christ's church, who
   are made by Christ kings and priests to his Father. 5. It was not only
   the place of the residence of the kings of David's line, where they had
   their palaces, and kept their courts; but also, what made it more
   glorious and comely than all the rest, it was "the city of the great
   king;" even of him who is the King of kings, who was set up by his
   Father, as king over his holy hill of Zion: so the church is Christ's
   palace, where he keeps his court, grants his presence, shows himself,
   and entertains his friends as courtiers; it is his rest, his
   habitation, where he dwells and delights to be, having chosen it for
   that purpose, 6. What made Jerusalem also exceeding comely, was, that
   the worship of God was kept up there: here was the temple; here
   sacrifices were offered up; hither the tribes went up to worship; and
   therefore is called, the city of our solemnities: Christ's church is
   the place of worship where saints assemble together, where God is
   reverenced and adored by them; where the sacrifice of prayer and praise
   are offered, up; where the word of God is preached, and his ordinances
   administered, to the comfort of his saints, and to the glory of his
   name. 7. Jerusalem, as it was beautiful in its inward buildings, so it
   was likewise in its outward fortifications, which were both natural and
   artificial; it had not only many towers and bulwarks, which were its
   artificial fortifications, ,but had also mountains around it, which
   were natural ones; and for this reason the church and people of God are
   compared to it, in Psalm 125:2. "As the mountains are round about
   Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people, from henceforth, even
   for ever:" God himself is a wall of fire around his church; Christ is a
   strong tower in the midst of it, and salvation has God appointed for
   walls and bulwarks about it. 8. Jerusalem was a free city, as is
   Jerusalem, which is the mother of us all; it had many privileges and
   immunities, as has also the church of Christ, and all the members of
   it; all who are "fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of
   God," are all Christ's freemen, and enjoy the liberty of the gospel,
   and can never lose their freedoms, nor be deprived of them; they shall
   never be arrested by divine justice, nor come into condemnation, nor be
   reduced to a state of bondage.

   III.He also says of her, that she was "terrible as an army with
   banners." This comparison manifestly shows, that it was not any single
   person that is intended in this song; not Pharaoh's daughter, nor any
   single inhabitant of Jerusalem; but a considerable company of persons,
   a collective body, such as the church of Christ is; for a single person
   cannot well be compared to an army with banners. Now this shows that
   the church of Christ on earth is militant; she is in a warfare state,
   and has many enemies to fight with, as sin, Satan, and the world; she
   has enemies within and enemies without; "a great fight of afflictions"
   to endure, and "the good fight of faith to fight," after which she is
   to receive eternal life: the use of banners has been taken notice of,
   on chapter 2:4. Moreover, this comparison may lead us to observe, that
   the church was as an army in good order, well-disciplined, having
   proper officers and good, armor: Christ is the chief general; the
   ministers of the gospel are the under-officers; the banner is love; and
   the armor they are accoutred with, what you read of in Ephesians 6,
   says not only so, but that she was in a posture of defense, ready to
   fight, whenever the enemy should attack her: she appeared like an army,
   having its general at the head of it, its colors flying, drums beating,
   and sword in hand; and being so, she was terrible to her enemies, sin,
   Satan, and the world.

   Now the terribleness of the church of Christ, here spoken of, may be
   understood, either, 1. Of that awe which godly persons have over the
   wicked; the good examples and pious conversations of the saints often
   distress the consciences, and strike an awe upon the minds of the
   ungodly; they are deterred sometimes by them from evil practices,
   especially when in the presence of them, and are awed by them from
   doing them any hurt; thus Herod feared John the Baptist, because he was
   a holy man (Mark 6:20). Or, 2. Of the invincibleness of the saints,
   when united together; when they are at peace one with another, and have
   no discord and mutiny among themselves, but keep close to each other,
   and endeavor to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,"
   they are like an army in battle-array, that cannot easily be broke in
   upon by the enemy. Or, 3. Of her constancy and undauntedness in seeking
   of him; and it is as if he should say, When I parted from thee, what
   difficulties, didst thou meet with? How wast thou abused by the
   watchmen and. keepers of the walls? who smote and wounded thee, and
   took away thy veil from thee; and yet thou wast not discouraged, but
   still went on in search of me, marching like an army with banners,
   bearing down all before thee, surmounting all difficulties until thou
   hadst obtained what thou soughtest for, Or, 4. Perhaps Christ may say
   so of her, as regarding himself: who had felt the power of her arms,
   and was conquered by her; like another Jacob, she "had power with God,
   and prevailed." Her love to Christ was so great, her faith so strong,
   she so diligent in her search, and so importunate in her desires, that
   he could not withstand her; and therefore, as one that had found her to
   be "terrible as an army with banners," says, in the following words,

Chapter 6 Verse 5a

   Former part. Turn away thine eyes from me,
   or they have overcome me.--
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word this and the two following verses, Christ gives a more
   particular account of the church's beauty, and begins with her eyes in
   these words; for though they are delivered in such a manner as they be,
   yet they serve to commend that particular part of her, here mentioned;
   which is never taken notice of by Christ in this song but with
   commendation; see chapter 1:15 and 4:1,9; and 7:4. And in these words
   may be observed,

   I.Something that is enjoined the church by Christ; which is, to "turn
   away her eyes from him."

   II.The reason of it; "for they have overcome me."

   I.Here is an injunction laid upon the church by Christ, to turn away
   her eyes from him; in which may be inquired, 1st, What is meant by her
   eyes, 2dly, What by turning them away from him.

   1st, By her eyes may be meant, as has been observed on chapter 1:15,
   the ministers of the gospel, who are that to Christ's body, the church,
   as eyes are to an human body; they are placed in a more eminent part of
   it; their business, is to watch, inspect, and overlook the several
   members of the body, and therefore are called-watchmen and overseers;
   they pry, search and penetrate into gospel truths, and discover them to
   others; they guide and direct those who are under their watch and care,
   "teaching them to observe all things" which Christ has commanded them.
   The Targum, by eyes, understands the Rabbins, and wise men of the great
   congregation: and R. Aben Ezra, by the turning of them away, the
   removal or ceasing of prophecy in the second temple. Or else, by eyes
   may be meant, the enlightened eyes of the church's understanding; the
   eyes of her faith, love, and knowledge; that eye of faith which looked
   upon Christ in the dark) and was the evidence of an unseen Jesus to
   her; so that she could say, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is
   mine:" this eye of faith, I say, had pierced the heart of Christ, won
   it, and got an entire conquest over it; which obliged him to say these
   words, "Turn sway thine eyes from me," etc. That love which she had
   shown unto him, though absent from her, discovered in a variety of
   expressions to the daughters of Jerusalem, appeared exceeding fair and
   beautiful to him; her strong and constant affections to him, being
   attended with solid judgment, and an exact knowledge of his person and
   grace, took much with his heart, struck the passions of his soul, which
   shewed and gave themselves vent in such expressions as these. And these
   eyes of faith and love, I take to be principally intended here. But,

   2dly, It may be inquired what is also meant by turning away these eyes
   from him, Some read the words thus, "Turn about thine eyes over against
   me;" so Ainsworth: and this. is favored by the Targum or Chaldee
   paraphrase upon the text; and so indeed the word signifies to turn to
   as well as to turn from. And this, 1. Suits well with the mind and will
   of Christ: which is, that his church and all believers should be
   continually looking to him for life and salvation, righteousness and
   strength, peace and pardon, joy and comfort; and in short, for every
   needful supply of grace, until they are brought safe to glory: his
   language is, "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth;
   for I am God, and there is none else," (Isa. 45:22). 2. It suits with
   the experience of God's children; who often have their eyes taken off
   from Christ, and set either upon their own righteousness, their duties,
   and their frames; or else upon creature enjoyments, the transitory and
   perishing things of this world; and therefore have need to be called
   off from them, to look to him: and perhaps this was the case of the
   church here; she had had her eyes intently fixed on Christ for some
   time, and now on a sudden they are diverted from him, and therefore he
   gives her this exhortation, to turn them again to him. Which shows, 3.
   That he was well pleased and exceedingly delighted with them: faith is
   a precious grace; it is so in its own nature, and in the actings of it
   upon the person of Christ; it is a precious grace to believers, being
   very useful to them in dealing with Christ, and receiving from him; and
   it is also precious to Christ, seeing it brings all the glory back to
   him: how much Christ is delighted with both these eyes of faith and
   love, may be seen in chapter 4:9, 10. 4. This version, or reading of
   the words, may lead us to observe, that Christ would have us not: to
   take side-looks only of him, but full views; "turn about thine eyes
   over against me," right over against me; look me full in the face: it
   is true, Christ's countenance is as the sun, when it shineth in its
   full strength; which we, in this imperfect state, cannot so fully and
   directly look at; yet there is a vast difference between faith's
   looking at Christ at one time land at another: sometimes we have only a
   glance, a side-look at Christ; at other times, faith, with open face,
   beholds, "as in a glass, the glory of the Lord:" our eyes, as Solomon
   directs (Prov. 4:23), "look right on, and our eyelids look straight
   before us;" and this is what Christ would have his church do here. 5.
   It gives us an intimation, that we should look all around Christ, and
   take as it were a survey of his person, and the glories and
   excellencies of it; turn about thine eyes; look all around me, view me
   from head to foot, on all sides: It is true, thou hast been viewing me,
   as if he should say, and giving an excellent description of me; but
   turn thine eyes about me again and again, thou wilt find more glories
   still, fresher beauties, and be able to make new discoveries of my
   person and grace. 6. This being the first time of their meeting
   together, after she had so shamefully and basely treated him; she might
   be filled with so much shame and confusion at the thoughts of it, that
   she could not lift up her eyes, and look him in the face; which agrees
   with the experience of the psalmist, when he said, Psalm 40:12, "Mine
   iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up,"
   And this now being her condition, Christ speaks these words to her, for
   her encouragement, turn thine eyes unto me; look up with an holy and
   humble confidence to me, for thine iniquity is done away.

   But then, if we consider the words as our translators have rendered
   them, we are not to understand them, either, 1. As a reprehension of
   her curiosity, in prying and searching into the glory and greatness of
   his majesty, which is the sense that some [760] give of the words; for
   though Christ, as God almighty, cannot be found out to perfection; nor
   can we comprehend his person and grace as God-man in this imperfect"
   life; nor see him as he as, which is reserved to another and more
   perfect one; yet this does not forbid our search and inquiries, in
   order to obtain a more perfect knowledge of him; though a check should
   be given, and a restraint laid upon all vain curiosity": but this does
   not appear to be the case of the church here; Christ was not displeased
   with her, nor had he absented himself from her on such an account as
   this, but because of her slothfulness and negligence in duty; besides,
   it does not appear likely that Christ, when he is extolling and
   commending his church in such a manner, should give so severe a rebuke
   unto her. 2. Nor were these eyes of hers carnal and sinful, haughty and
   lifted up, or wanton and unchaste, and therefore disagreeable to him;
   no, her eyes are said to he doves eyes within her locks, modest, humble
   and chaste; which are well-pleasing to him, and are always commended by
   him. Nor, 3. Are we to understand the words as if Christ did not
   approve of her looking to him by faith; for there is nothing more
   grateful to him; faith always meets with a kind reception from him, and
   is always commended by him: souls need not fear its being accounted a
   piece of boldness or presumption in them to believe in Christ, for he
   gives all encouragement to it; "Ye believe in God," says he, "believe
   also in me," (John 14:1). But, 4. It is expressive of the exceeding
   great passion of love he was in with her; he could stand it out no
   longer, but must acknowledge he was overcome by" her, and therefore
   bids her turn away her eyes from him; not through any dislike, but as
   having his heart overpowered with love by them: the expression is
   designed to signify the exceeding greatness of Christ's love to the
   church, as well as, her surpassing beauty. Unless, 5. We would rather
   understand it as his will, that she should cease petitioning to him.
   seeing he had granted her request; thus, lifting up the eyes to God,
   signifies prayer to him; see 2 Chronicles 20:12. Psalm 123:1, and if we
   take it in this sense here, it is as if he should say; thou hast been
   lifting up thine eyes to me, and petitioning me, that thou mightest
   have some discoveries of my grace, enjoyment of my presence, and
   communion with my person; and now thou mayest turn away thine eyes from
   me, or cease petitioning; for thou hast the thing thou hast been
   praying and looking up to me for.

   II.The reason of Christ's saying so to his church, or bidding her "turn
   away her eyes from him," is because they had overcome him. These words
   are very differently rendered. 1. Some read them thus, "for they have
   lifted me up," so Ainsworth; or, "that they might lift me up," [761] so
   Junius that is, make me cheerful, comfort and encourage me: there is a
   near union between Christ and his church, from whence arises a very
   great sympathy; he has a fellow-feeling with his people in all their
   afflictions, both inward and outward, temporal and spiritual; when they
   are afflicted, he is afflicted; when they are east down, he is as it
   were cast down with them; and when they are cheerful, he is so too; he
   "weeps with them that weep, and rejoices with them that rejoice:" the
   church being in a comfortable frame, and in the exercise of faith and
   love upon him, he is as it were cheered by it, and. rejoiced at it; but
   this must be understood only as expressive of that near sympathy there
   is between them, and not as implying weakness or alteration in him, who
   is subject to no change. 2. Others read the words thus, " for they have
   strengthened me;" [762] and so our translators have rendered the word,
   in Psalm 138:3, and then the sense is, they have strengthened my desire
   towards thee and confirmed me in it, as R. David Kimchi [763] observes;
   and it is as if he should say, It is true, as I am thine, and thou art
   mine, I always had a desire towards thee, and to thy company; and it is
   not long since I signified it to thee; but since thine eyes have been
   so intently fixed on me, thy faith and love have been so exercised upon
   me, methinks my desire towards thee is strengthened and increased: but
   this must be understood as expressive of that great regard which Christ
   had to her, and be taken with the same caution as before. 3. Others,
   [764] as R. Sol. Jarchi, read the words thus, "for they have made me
   proud;" the word is rendered, "to behave one's self proudly," in Isaiah
   3:5, by our translators: Christ, as I may so say, is proud of his
   people, whom the Father has given him, and he has purchased with his
   own blood; he takes a kind of pride as well as pleasure in them; he is
   proud of that beauty which he himself has put upon them, and of those
   graces which he has wrought in them, and especially that of faith, when
   it is in exercise: What notice did he take of the Centurion's faith?
   and in a kind of a boasting manner, as being proud of it, say to his
   followers, "I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel:" here
   is an instance of faith for you, such an one as is not to be matched in
   Israel. 4. Others [765] read them thus, "they have made me fierce;" not
   with anger and indignation, but with love; for there is a power, a
   force, a fierceness in love, as well as in wrath; "love is strong as
   death;" it is so not only in Christ's people towards him, but more
   especially in him towards them; his affections are very strong towards
   them, and are sometimes let out with a greater force upon them than at
   other times, as they seem to be here. 5. R. Aben Ezra [766] renders
   them thus, "they are stronger than me," or, "they have taken away my
   strength;" so that I am as one that is dead, and have no life and
   spirit in me; these sparkling eyes of thine have transported me into a
   kind of ecstasy, that I am scarce myself: and to this purpose the
   Septuagint render it, "they have made me to fly away;" [767] that is,
   out of myself; which agrees with our version, "they have overcome me,"
   I am not master of myself; the sense is the same with chapter 4:9. Now
   this shows us, (1.) The power of faith; which not only subdues
   kingdoms, stops the mouths of lions, and puts to flight the armies of
   the aliens," but conquers God himself. (2.) This is owing very much to
   the importunity of it, which is increased by seeming denials: faith
   will not let Christ alone, nor let him go, nor will I cease
   petitioning, till it has got the blessing; sad the repulses it meets
   with, do but increase its importunity (see Gen. 32:26; Ex. 32:9, 10;
   Matthew 15:24-28). (3.) Christ's being overcome by the church, does not
   imply any, weakness in him; but is a discovery of his astonishing,
   condescending love and grace, that he should be willing to be held, as
   it were a captive, by a poor sinful creature; that He should be willing
   to be overcome by us, who has conquered all our enemies, sin, Satan,
   hell and death for us, is surprising and amazing; and perhaps on this
   account, as well as upon some others, we may be said to be "more than
   conquerors," because we are the conquerors of him who has conquered
   all.

     __________________________________________________________________

   first word commendations of the church's beauty are delivered in the
   same words in chapter 4:1-3, but the repetition of them here is not
   vain and idle, but may be for the following reasons: 1. To show the
   reality and certainty of her beauty; that it was no imaginary beauty,
   but a real one: so things are sometimes repeated for the confirmation
   of them. 2. To put her in mind of it, that she might value it, and
   herself upon it, as coming from Christ; who had made her perfectly
   comely, through the comeliness which he had put upon her. 3. To assure
   her that her beauty was still the same, and that he had the same
   opinion of it as ever he had, notwithstanding all her failings and
   infirmities; and therefore expresses it in the very same words he had
   used before her backslidings from him. 4. To manifest the
   unchangeableness of his love towards her; that he is "Jesus, the same
   today, yesterday, and for ever;" that is "the Lord that changes not,
   and therefore the sons of Jacob are not consumed." But having explained
   these words in chapter 4. I shall not consider them any farther here;
   but only just observe some variations and differences between them,
   though they are not indeed very material. In verse 5, the word mount is
   omitted, which may be supplied from chapter 4:1. In verse 6, the word
   sheep is expressed, which is understood in chapter 4:2, as are the
   words even shorn omitted here, though expressed there. In verse 7, is
   wholly omitted that part of the description which concerns the beauty
   of the church's lips and speech; though it is added at the end of the
   sixth verse by the Septuagint; but is not in the Hebrew copies; neither
   is it taken notice of by the Targum on the place; nay, the Masora on
   chapter 4:3, remarks some words as only used in that place, and
   therefore this was not repeated here in the copies then in use.

Chapter 6 Verse 8 & 9

   VERSE 8.

   There are threescore queens and fourscore concubines;
   and virgins without number.

   VERSE 9.

   My dove, my undefiled, is but one; the is the only one of her
   mother; she is the choice one of her that bare her: the daughters
   saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and
   they praised her.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having commended the church's beauty, both in general and in
   particular instances, as she might be considered by herself, without
   respect to others, in the preceding verses; now commends her, as she
   might stand related to, or be compared with others. And,

   I.The persons with whom she stands compared, and to whom she appears
   preferable, are "queens, concubines, and virgins without number."

   II.The things in which she appears to be preferable to them, are,

   First, That she "is but one." Secondly, "The only one of her me, thee."
   Thirdly, "The choice one of her that bare her." And then,

   III.Her beauty is commended by the notice the "daughters, queens, and
   concubines" took of it; who, as soon as ever "they saw her, blessed and
   praised her."

   I.The persons with whom she stands compared, and appears preferable to,
   are, "the threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins
   without number," mentioned in verse 8, which words may be considered,
   either as an assertion that there are so many, a certain number being
   put for an uncertain one; or else, as a supposition, though there may
   be so many, yet "my undefiled is but one," etc. Queens are those who
   were the principal wives of kings, who brought portions with them;
   whose children inherited, and they themselves, with their royal
   husbands, had the management of affairs: Concubines are secondary
   wives, or half wives, as the word [768] nmay be rendered; they were
   such who brought no portions with them; [769] and though they were
   admitted to the fellowship of the bed, yet their children did not
   inherit, but had only some gifts given to them; nor had they themselves
   any share in the government of the house, but rather acted like
   servants under the other; such were Hagar, Zilpah, Bilhah, etc. "The
   virgins without number," are unmarried persons; these were the maids of
   honor, who waited and attended upon the queens. Now there are in the
   words an allusion either to the custom and practice of kings and great
   persons, who had more wives than one, had many concubines, and a large
   number of virgins to attend upon them; and this was not only the
   practice of heathen, but also of Jewish princes, as David and Solomon;
   which latter, more especially, had a large number: and it is thought
   that a regard is had more particularly to his queens and concubines in
   this text; for which reason some have thought that this back was
   written before he gave so great a loose to his lusts, as we find he
   did; for we are told (1 Kings 11:3), that he had seven hundred wives,
   princesses, and three hundred concubines. Or else, the allusion is to a
   nuptial solemnity, and the ceremony of introducing the bride into the
   bridegroom's house, who used to be attended with a large number of
   persons of distinction; so four times sixty virgins are said to attend
   the nuptials of Menelaus and Helena [770] (see Ps. 45), between which
   and this song there is a very great resemblance; and perhaps that was
   the plan of this: there the queen is represented as standing in "gold
   of Ophir," which answers to Christ's church and bride here, and means
   the same there: also "kings daughters," which answer to the queens
   here, are said to be among her "honorable women" who were attendants on
   her; and the "virgins, her companions," are said to "follow her," when
   she was introduced into the king's presence.

   Now by these "threescore queens, fourscore concubines, and virgins
   without number," may be meant, either,

   1st, The several kingdoms and nations of the world: and by queens may
   be meant those kingdoms and countries, which are more large, rich, and
   flourishing; by concubines, those which are inferior to them, either in
   largeness, riches, or numbers; and by virgins, the vast multitude of
   inhabitants which fall them; and then the sense is this: though there
   are many large, rich and populous nations in the world; yet my church
   is preferable to them all: these all put together, cannot equal her;
   for "as the lily is among thorns," and is preferable to them; so my
   love is among the daughters," the nations of the world, and is
   preferable to them all. Or,

   2dly, By them may be meant false churches, who pretend to be the true
   spouse of Christ, but are not so: by queens may be meant, those who
   boast themselves of their riches and numbers, and would be esteemed on
   that account the true bride of Christ; as the church of Rome, who saith
   in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow;" and yet is an harlot,
   nay, "the mother of harlots." By concubines, such who are inferior in
   wealth and numbers, but equally corrupt in principles, and which make
   the same pretensions the others do; such are the Arian, Socinian, etc.,
   churches: and by "virgins without number," the large multitude of poor,
   weak and ignorant people, who are seduced and carried aside by them.
   But now Christ's church, though it does not make so great a figure in
   the world; nor does it appear in so much external pomp and splendor;
   nor has it the riches and numbers that these may have; yet in Christ's
   esteem is preferable to them all. Though,

   3dly, Others [771] think, that the several sorts of preachers in the
   church are here intended: and that by queens, are meant ministers of
   the first rank; who are faithful to Christ and his gospel, and are
   instrumental in bringing forth many souls unto him: and by concubines,
   such who "corrupt the word of God, and handle it deceitfully:" who are
   "false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the
   apostles of Christ;" who seek not Christ but themselves; not his honor,
   but their own applause: and by virgins, such who, though regenerated,
   vet at present are not fit for the ministry, but are training up for it
   in the several churches or schools of learning; and may be such, whom
   the apostle calls novices; not a novice, nefuton, a young tender plant;
   one that is newly planted in Christianity, and has arrived to some
   knowledge of the gospel, but as yet not fit for the office of a bishop.
   But,

   4thly, The words seem rather to be understood of the several degrees of
   believers. [772] By queens, may be meant believers of the highest form;
   such whom Christ has honored with greater gifts and larger measures of
   grace; in whose hearts and lives grace reigns more gloriously than in
   others; and who have a greater nearness to Christ, and more communion
   with him than others have: and by concubines, believers of an inferior
   sort, who are of a more servile and legal spirit, have more of "a
   spirit of bondage than the spirit of adoption," but yet these have
   fellowship and communion with Christ at times: and by virgins, young
   converts, newborn babes, that have not so much experience as either of
   the former: so that this distribution of believers into "queens,
   concubines, and virgins," seems to suit with the division of them into
   "fathers, young men, and children," which is made (1 John 2:13, 14),
   and what seems to strengthen this sense of the words, is their blessing
   and praising the bride in the following verse. In an ancient tract of
   the Jews, called Midrash Hanneelam, [773] the queens, in the next
   verse, are said to be the fathers or patriarchs; the concubines, the
   proselytes of righteousness; and the daughters, the daughters of
   Jerusalem. Now Christ's church, considered as a collective body, is
   preferable to single believers, even to the greatest of them: and it is
   also well observed by one, [774] that there are more concubines than
   queens, and more virgins than either of them; for there are more weak
   believers and babes in Christ, than there are strong ones; those of the
   highest rank and form are very rare; there are but few to be found in
   comparison of the other; but Christ's bride comprehends them all, and
   is preferable to them; which is the next thing to be considered.

   II.Christ, in verse 9, commends his church above all these queens,
   concubines and virgins; he gives her two excellent titles, which show
   her to be superior to others; the first of which, "my dove," has been
   explained in chapter 2:14, and the other, "my undefiled," in chapter
   5:2, and therefore need no farther explanation here. The things in
   which she appears to be preferable to all these fore-mentioned persons,
   are,

   First, That she is but one, and they are many: which may be expressive,
   1. Of the church's fewness in number; who, if compared with the nations
   of the world, which is the first sense given of the former words, she
   is but like one to sixty or eighty, nay to an innumerable multitude;
   there are but few that are chosen, though many are externally called:
   Christ's church is a remnant, according to the election of grace; it is
   but one of a city, and two of a family that Christ brings to Zion; they
   are but a little flock, to whom the heavenly kingdom is bequeathed. 2.
   Of the church's unity in herself. (1.) She is but one body; as there
   are various members in an human body, and yet but one body; so likewise
   is the church, though consisting of many believers; as there are many
   sheep and lambs in a flock, and yet but one flock, under the care of
   one shepherd; many beds in a garden, and a variety of spices, flowers,
   herbs and plants in these beds, and yet but one garden; even so, though
   there are many particular congregated churches, and in those churches
   many believers; yet there is but one "general assembly and church of
   the first born, which are written in heaven." (2.) She has but one
   spirit, which actuates and influences this body, the same Spirit that
   dwells in the head, Christ, dwells in his body, the church; and the
   same that dwells in the body, dwells in every member of it; for though
   there are diversities of gifts, and various graces, yet there is but
   one Spirit who distributes them to the several members, for their use
   and profit. (3.) She has but one head and husband, Lord and Savior: she
   has but one head, to whom she holds, and from whom she receives life
   and nourishment, and so increases with the increase of God; but one
   husband, whom she owns and acknowledges as such, and to whom she is
   "espoused as a chaste virgin;" but one lord. under whose government she
   is, and to whom alone she yields obedience; and but one mediator, that
   she regards, and makes use of, and that is, "the man Christ Jesus."
   (4.) Though the church consists of many members; yet being but one body
   united to one head, and actuated by one and the same Spirit, they enjoy
   the same privileges; they are built upon one and the same foundation,
   Christ; they are washed in the same blood; they wear the same
   righteousness, and receive from the same fullness, "grace for grace."
   (5.) They make a profession of one and the same faith, for as there is
   but one Lord, so there is but one faith; the doctrine of grace is
   invariable; it is like the author of it, "the same yesterday, today,
   and for ever;" there never was another gospel, nor never will be; the
   faith which the church now professes, is what was "once delivered to
   the saints," to be kept by them; and which they, standing fast in one
   spirit, should strive for the purity of; which cannot be, unless they
   are "perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same
   judgment. (6.) They are in the same one in worship: the object of
   worship is one and the same; and so is the Spirit which assists them in
   it, as well as the form of it; for as there is but one Lord, and one
   faith, so there is but one baptism: whose subjects and mode of
   administration should continue the same, without any variation, until
   the end of time: and but one Lord's supper: and so it may be said of
   every other ordinance, and of every part of religious worship; for
   saints, as they worship one and the same God, under the influences of
   one and the same Spirit, and in the same way; so likewise should they,
   with one consent: which they cannot be said to do, when an ordinance is
   administered by some one way, and by some another. (7.) They are one in
   affections, or at least ought to be; their chief business should be to
   "keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace," and that from the
   aforesaid considerations: for this is one end of their calling, the
   glory of their profession, and a distinguishing character of their
   being the disciples and church of Christ. This may be also expressive
   of her being the only spouse and bride of Christ; "my dove, my
   undefiled is but one;" that is, though other princes may have their
   sixty queens and eighty concubines, and an innumerable company of
   virgins to wait upon them; yet I have but one, and am well satisfied
   with her, I desire none but her; my one is preferable to their many; as
   she says, "I am my beloved's:" that is, I only am his, he has none
   besides me and "his desire is towards me," and to none else.

   Secondly, He says, that she is the only one of her mother." By her
   mother is meant "Jerusalem, which is above, which is the mother of us
   all:" and by her being "the only one of her mother," we are to
   understand that she had no other but her: for though we read, in
   chapter 1:6, of "her mother's children," yet we are to understand them
   of carnal professors; who had the name, but not the nature of children;
   were not true sons of the church, were bastards, and not sons. Or else
   the meaning is, that she was to him as a mother's only child; no mother
   could more tenderly love an only child, than he did her: so that it may
   be expressive of that strong affection and tender passion which he bore
   to her.

   Thirdly, he says, that she is the choice one of her that bare her,"
   which is a periphrasis of her mother; and her being the "choice one of
   her," shows how much she was valued and esteemed by her; of all her
   mother's children, she was loved the best. Moreover, the word may be
   translated, "the pure or clean one;" [775] and so she is as clothed
   with that "fine linen, clean and white, which is the righteousness of
   the saints," as washed in Christ's blood, which "cleanseth from all
   sin;" as sanctified by the Spirit, purified by faith, and sprinkled
   with clean water, the grace of the everlasting covenant: also, as she
   was free from the pollution of error and false worship; was of an
   unspotted conversation; and was now, or at least had been lately, in
   the furnace of affliction, where Christ had purified her, and made her
   white and clean.

   III.Christ commends her beauty, by observing what notice the daughters,
   queens and concubines took of it, and how much they praised and
   commended her for it: "The daughters saw her, and blessed her, the
   queens and the concubines, and they praised her:" it may seem strange
   that concubines should praise a queen; but it was not unusual in the
   eastern countries; with the Persians, as the queen admitted of many
   concubines, by the order of her lord the king; so the queen was had in
   great veneration, and even adored by the concubines. [776] Which may be
   understood, 1. Of the great esteem which the church had or should have
   in the world, and that from the great men of it; which will appear more
   visibly in the latter day, when those prophecies shall be fulfilled, of
   which we read in Isaiah 49:23 and 60:3,10,11, when kings shall be, her
   nursing fathers, and queens her nursing mothers; and God's Jerusalem,
   the church, shall be the praise of the whole earth. Or, 2. Of the great
   value and esteem which professors, and especially young converts, have
   of the church; in whose eyes she is "the fairest among women;" who, as
   soon as ever they saw her, were ravished with her beauty, loved her,
   and wished themselves as happy as she: for, 3. They blessed her; that
   is accounted her happy; as well they might, seeing she was "blessed
   with all spiritual blessings in Christ;" and indeed whether we consider
   the saints, either as to their entertainment in God's house, or their
   employment there, it may be said of them what the queen of Sheba said
   of Solomon's servants (1 Kings 10:8). "Happy are thy men, happy are
   these thy servants which stand continually before thee, and hear thy
   wisdom." And, 4. They wished all happiness to her, and prayed for it,
   which also may be the sense of the words, they blessed her (see Ps.
   129:8), they prayed for the peace of Jerusalem, which was their duty;
   and in doing which, they show their affection to the church: nay, 5.
   They not only thought well of her, and wished well to her; but they
   also praised her, that is, they spoke well of her, and highly commended
   her beauty: so that Christ was not alone in his opinion of her; for
   others thought her to be an accomplished beauty, as well as he: and
   this, as it serves to commend her beauty, so its being taken notice of
   by Christ, shows how much he was pleased with it, for as those that
   touch his people, "touch the apple of his eye;" and whatsoever is
   spoken against them, he takes as spoken against himself; so, whenever
   they are praised and spoken well of, he is well pleased with it.

Chapter 6 Verse 10

   Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon,
   clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are either the words of Christ, commending and wondering at
   the beauty of his church, and confirming the daughters praises of her;
   which shows that they were neither wrong, nor were they alone in their
   opinion of her; for she was an astonishing beauty in the eyes of him,
   who seeth not as man seeth, neither judges after the outward
   appearance: or else, they are the words of the daughters of Jerusalem
   continued; and this I rather incline to, for the following reasons: 1.
   The connection between this and the preceding verse is very easy;
   especially if we supply the word saying, as it is sometimes done, as in
   Jeremiah 31:3, and so read the words thus; "the daughters saw her, and
   blessed her; the queens and the concubines, and they praised her,
   saying, Who is she that looketh forth as the morning?'" etc., 2. This
   gives a ready answer to such a question that she might be asked, What
   was it the daughters, queens, and concubines said of her, when they
   gave her commendations, declared her the happy person, and sung her
   praises? why, it was this, "Who is she that looketh forth as the
   morning?" etc., 3. It confirms what Christ had said of her, in verse 4,
   that she was "terrible as an army with banners;" that they had just the
   same opinion of her as he had, and therefore use the same words: but if
   they were supposed to be the words of Christ, it would make a manifest
   tautology, which is scarce to be allowed of in the same commendation.
   4. It best agrees with other parts of this song, which appear to he the
   words of the daughters of Jerusalem, as chapter 3:6 and 8:5. 5. The
   Targum, or Chaldee paraphrase upon this text, takes them to be the
   words of the people or nations of the world, which, in this paraphrase,
   are sometimes understood by the daughters of Jerusalem. And though the
   words axe interrogatory, yet they are not the effect of ignorance, but
   of wonder and surprise, These daughters were not ignorant of the
   church; they knew who she was, but were surprised at her glory and
   beauty: the way of speaking is much like that in Isaiah 63:1. "Who is
   he that cometh from Edom," etc. Having now considered whose words they
   are, I shall in the next place consider the words themselves, and the
   meaning of them: and they may be expressive,

   First, Of the state and condition of the church in the several ages of
   the world; especially in those three remarkable ones, that before the
   law, that under the law, and this under the gospel. There is a manifest
   gradation in the text; and this appears in the church, in those several
   periods; in which there was an increase of her faith, light, knowledge,
   and glory. And,

   1st, The state of the church before the law was given, from Adam to
   Moses, may be intended in the first expression, "Who is she that
   looketh forth as the morning?" And here give me leave to observe, 1.
   That Adam's sin brought not only a night of darkness upon his own soul,
   but also upon all the world besides: man, who in his first creation was
   endued with light and knowledge, is now become a poor, dark creature,
   by the fall; nay, in darkness itself: he is born and brought up in
   darkness, and walks on in it, not knowing whether he goes, until he is
   called by divine grace; when he appears to be a child of the day, and
   not of night, nor of darkness. 2. The first display of grace to fallen
   man, which was in the garden, after the night of darkness had invaded
   his soul, was like the dawn of the morning; when the seed of the woman,
   the glorious Messiah, was made known to Adam; as who should break the
   head of the serpent, and so redeem him, and those of his fallen race,
   whom God had set apart for himself: this struck the light of joy and
   comfort into his soul; those dark and dreadful apprehensions he had of
   things, in a great measure then vanished and disappeared; this breaking
   up of covenant grace unto him, was like the break of day, or like the
   first appearance of a glorious morning: and as for Satan, whose works
   are works of darkness, and cannot bear the light; like a beast of prey
   he leered off, and lurked into his den, when this morning light thus
   first broke out: this was the first appearance and revelation of grace
   to fallen man. 3. This light of grace, which now began to show itself,
   like the morning light, increased yet more and more: there were greater
   breakings forth of it afterwards; not only to Adam himself, who was
   taught by God the way of sacrificing, and therein to look by faith to
   the great sacrifice, Christ, who was to be offered up for the sin of
   man; but also to succeeding patriarchs, particularly to Noah, who found
   grace in the eyes of the Lord, became a preacher of righteousness; and
   that not of moral righteousness only, but also of evangelical, even the
   righteousness which is by faith: but more especially to Abraham, to
   whom it was promised, that the Messiah should be of his seed, and in
   that seed all nations be blessed; there was so great a discovery of
   grace made unto him, that the gospel is said to be preached unto him:
   and then to his grandson Jacob, there was a greater discovery made; for
   not only the Messiah was revealed unto him as God's salvation, which he
   says he waited for, and that he should be of Abraham's seed; but also
   more particularly, that he should spring from the tribe of Judah: the
   time of his coming is pointed out by him, as well as the glory and
   magnificence which should attend him, by mighty confluence of people to
   him, in that famous prophecy of his (Gen. 49:10), thus the
   morning-light of the gospel went on apace, and increased exceedingly.
   But, 4. Though here was light broke forth, and that increasing, yet it
   was but small, in comparison of what appeared in after ages: the first
   display of grace seems rather to be by way of threatening to Satan,
   than by way of promise, to fallen man; and tho' it was made known to
   our first parents, that the Messiah should be the seed of the woman;
   yet perhaps it was not so clearly revealed, till Isaiah's time, that he
   should be born of a virgin; which might be the reason that our mother
   Eve was so mistaken in the birth of her first son, as to imagine that
   she had got the Messiah; for so those winds, in Genesis 4:1, according
   to some, may be read, "I have gotten a man, [777] the Lord;" and
   Jonathan Ben Uzziel, in his Targum on the place, paraphrases it thus,
   "I have got the man, the angel of the Lord;" but she could never have
   thought so, had she known that he was to be born of a virgin. Moreover,
   the greatness of his person, his several offices, of prophet, pries,
   and king; the nature, efficacy, and end of his sufferings; his
   resurrection, ascension and session at the Father's right hand, are
   more clearly spoken of by David, in his book of Psalms, and by Isaiah,
   in his prophecy, than were before; and no doubt but there was more
   light in the church, in David's, Solomon's, and more especially in
   Isaiah's time, than there had been in ages preceding. But yet, 5. Those
   discoveries of grace, which were mate before the law was given, like
   the cheerful morning, brought joy and comfort along with them,
   particularly to A tam; who stood trembling, expecting every moment to
   have the awful sentence of wrath pronounced, and the severe stroke of
   justice given; when on a sudden grace appears, a Savior is revealed;
   and the darkness of guilt and horror which filled his soul disappears,
   and in the room of it an universal joy and pleasure diffuses itself.
   The Jews [778] tell us of ten songs that are sung in the world; and the
   first, they say, was that which Adam sung when the Lord pardoned his
   iniquity; and indeed he had a great deal of reason for it. Nay, it was
   not only joy to Adam; but also to all the angels in heaven, who stood
   astonished and surprised to see all human nature lost at once, and that
   to all appearance irrecoverably; but whilst they were waiting to see
   what the issue of things would be, a glorious display of grace is made;
   the way of salvation, by the incarnate Son of God, is opened; which
   caused these bright seraphs to clap their wings, and these morning
   stars to sing together, "Glory to God in the highest:" for if they
   rejoice at the conversion of a single sinner much more would they at
   the tidings of salvation to Adam, and to so many of his race; and so
   all after discoveries of grace, to succeeding patriarchs, were more or
   less attended with joy and pleasure: it is particularly remarked of
   Abraham (John 8:56), that he saw Christ's day, and was glad.

   2dly, The state of the church under the law, may be represented under
   the second expression, "fair as the moon; which, though it receives its
   light from the sun [779] yet splendor and brightness are ascribed to it
   (Job 31:26), and by other writers, [780] it is represented as fair and
   beautiful; and the beautiful form of persons is expressed by it. [781]
   Such was the nature of divine worship under that dispensation, that it
   may very aptly be set forth by this phrase; and I cannot but be of
   opinion, that the ceremonial law is intended by the moon, which is said
   to be under the church's feet, in Revelation 12:1. for though it was
   abolished by the death of Christ, yet it was kept up and maintained by
   many of the Jews, even of those that believed; so that it as one of the
   greatest difficulties that the Christian church had to grapple with;
   for though it was under the feet of Christ) yet it was a long time
   before it was under the feet of the church; and a wonder it was when it
   was accomplished; for persons are naturally fond of ceremonies; and
   many had rather part with a doctrine, or an ordinance of the gospel,
   than with an idle ceremony, or an old custom, though never so
   ridiculous; and this was in a great measure the case of the Jews; "Thou
   seest, brother," says James to Paul, Acts 21:20, "how many thousands of
   Jews there are which believe, and they are all zealous of the law." Now
   the ceremonial law may be very aptly represented by the moon; for, 1.
   It consisted much in the observation of new moons; its solemn feasts
   were governed by them (see 2 Chron. 8:12, 13; Isa. 1:13, 14; Amos 8:5;
   Col. 2:16). 2. There was some light in it, and it gave light to the
   saints in the night of Jewish darkness; it pointed out Christ unto
   them; and was their schoolmaster, to teach and lead them to him. But,
   3. Like the moon, it was the lesser light, that which ruled by night,
   and not by clay: the light it gave was inferior to that which saints
   have under the gospel-dispensation. 4. As the moon has its spots, so
   had this its imperfections; had it been faultless, there had been no
   need of a new dispensation, to have succeeded; but God had provided
   some better thing for us, New Testament saints, that they, the Old
   Testament saints, without us should not be made perfect; for this law
   could not make them so; it could neither perfectly sanctify, nor
   justify, nor expiate sin. 5. Like the moon, was variable and
   changeable: it is done away; this middle wall of partition is broken
   down; this hand-writing of ordinances is blotted out; it is not only
   like the moon in the wane, waxen old, but is also entirely vanished
   away. But now, notwithstanding all this, the church, as considered in
   her observance of the ceremonial law, was fair; there was a beauty in
   that kind of worship; the laws of it, being the ordinances and
   institutions of God, and when performed in faith, and according to the
   will of God, were amiable and lovely. But,

   3dly, The state of the church under the gospel-dispensation, may be
   said to be "clear as the sun;" for now the glorious sun of
   righteousness is risen, that great "light of the world" has appeared,
   and made "that day," which, by way of emphasis, is so often spoken of
   in the books of the prophets: now the shadows are fled and gone,
   Christ, the substance, being come; greater light, and more knowledge,
   with clearer faith, are the saints possessed of than they were under
   the law; "the least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than John the
   Baptist: now saints, not with faces veiled, but with open face; not
   through cloudy shadows and cloudy sacrifices; but as in a clear,
   transparent glass behold the glory of the Lord, and are changed" into
   it; Some Jewish writers [782] interpret this of the coming of the
   Messiah, and redemption by him, before whom darkness will flee away.
   Moreover, as there is one glory of the moon, and another glory of the
   sun, and that of the sun far exceeds that of the moon; so the glory of
   the gospel dispensation far exceeds that of the legal one: if the
   church was then "fair as the moon," she must be now "clear as the sun:"
   The excelling glory of the gospel-dispensation is set in a true light
   by the apostle, in Corinthians 3:7-10. Now,

   4thly, The church, in all these several periods whether she be
   considered before the law, or under the law, or under the gospel, is
   "terrible as an army with banners;" the church was always militant in
   all ages of the world; and as she never wanted enemies to fight with,
   so she never wanted a leader, and a commander to march before her; nor
   proper officers to keep her in order; nor suitable armor to put on and
   use; nor did she ever fail of victory, but was always "more than a
   conqueror through him that loved her;" and so was like a well-ordered
   or well-disciplined army, terrible to her enemies.

   Secondly, The state of the Christian church, from the times of Christ
   and his apostles, until his second coming and presentation of her to
   himself in glory, may be here represented. And,

   1st, The primitive church, or that in the age of the apostles, may be
   intended by the first expression; "Who is she that looketh forth as the
   morning?" for then the morning of gospel light broke, and swiftly and
   suddenly spread itself over the nations of the world; it produced joy
   and gladness wherever it came; and moved on irresistibly, maugre all
   the opposition that was made against it; and could no more be stopped
   in its progress, than the morning-light can.

   2dly, The state of the church, in some after-ages, may be set forth by
   the next phrase, "fair as the moon," it being variable and changeable;
   and like the moon, had different phases and appearances; sometimes
   lying under sore trials and grievous persecutions, and at other times
   enjoying rest and peace; sometimes retaining the doctrines and
   ordinances of the gospel. In their power and purity, and at other times
   overrun with errors and heresies.

   3dly, The church being said to be "clear as the sun," may either be
   descriptive of her state and condition in Constantine's time, when she
   was "clothed with the sun;" was in a great deal of splendor and glory;
   had the moon, the ceremonial law, "under her feet," and "a crown of
   twelve stars upon her head," the glorious doctrine of the twelve
   apostles; and were as terrible to her adversaries "as an army with
   banners:" or else, the state of the church in the latter-day-glory;
   when "the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the
   light of the sun shall be sevenfold:" or else, as glorified in heaven,
   enjoying consummate happiness with Christ in the kingdom of his Father;
   where "the righteous shine forth as the sun," and are out of the reach
   of all their enemies.

   Thirdly, These words may also be expressive of the state and condition
   of particular believers, who, in their first conversion, may be said to
   "look forth as the morning;" their light and knowledge being but small,
   and their faith weak; but yet, like the morning-light, increasing; for
   "the path of the just is as the shining light which shines more and
   more unto the perfect day:" as also her being compared to the morning,
   may intend the beauty [783] and glory of believers, both in their faith
   and walk; she looks forth as the morning;" the look of faith is
   exceeding beautiful in Christ's eve; see chapter 4:9, or, "goes forth
   as the rising morn" [784] as the Vulgate Latin reads it; that is, her
   talk and conversation is exceeding comely. Moreover, believers, as to
   their sanctification, may be said to be "fair as the moon," which has
   its spots in it; and what light it has, it derives from the sun: so the
   sanctification of believers is imperfect, and all the light, grace, and
   holiness they have come from the sun of righteousness; but then as to
   their justification, they are clear as the sun. all fair and no spot in
   them; and in their faith and conversation are terrible to their
   enemies, as an army with banners.

Chapter 6 Verse 11

   I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valley,
   and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates
   budded.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are either the words of the church, or of Christ: Some [785]
   take them to be the words of the church, who not finding Christ on
   earth, sought him in the heavenly paradise, which they understand by
   this nut-garden; and by her going down into it, ,he lively exercise of
   her faith on the unseen joys and glories of it, in looking to them,
   seeking of them, and pressing after them: though others [786] who also
   understand them as the words of the church; yet think that they
   represent her as giving a reason why, upon his departure from her, she
   went not only into the city, but also into the fields, and that in the
   night-season, which might not appear so reputable to one of her sex;
   therefore to wipe off all reproach, and to remove all suspicion of evil
   designs in her, as well as to inform him now she had employed herself
   during his absence, she tells him that she went into the nut-garden, to
   inspect the fruits of it, and to see in what case the vines and
   pomegranates were. Tho' I rather think that they are the words of
   Christ, declaring to his church where he went, and what he employed
   himself about, when he departed from her; and that he was not even then
   altogether unmindful of her; but narrowly looked into the state and
   case of her, and her members, when she thought he was at a distance
   from her: and this agrees with what Christ had said, in chapter 5:1, "I
   am come into my garden," etc. and also confirms what she had said, in
   5:2, of this chapter, "My beloved is gone down into his garden," etc.
   Besides, it best suits with him, who is the owner of the garden, to
   look after the fruits of it, and to see in what case it stands:
   moreover, this was the usual place of Christ's residence. Taking them
   then to be the words of Christ, there are two things to be considered.

   I.Want is meant by this "garden of nuts," into which, Christ says, he
   "went down."

   II.The tact of his going there; which is threefold. 1st, "To see the
   fruits of the valley." 2dly, "To see whether the vine flourished."
   3dly, Whether "the pomegranates budded."

   I. I shall inquire what is meant by this "garden of nuts," into which
   Christ is said to go Some Jewish [787] interpreter, understand by it,
   the second temple, which was built by the commandment of Cyrus king of
   Persia; but it seems better to understand it of the church of Christ,
   which is compared to a garden, in chapter 4:12, and for what reasons
   has been there shown; and Christ being said to go down into it, may be
   an allusion to Solomon's gardens, which lay low, and required a descent
   unto them from his palace; and thus not only is expressive of the state
   and condition of Christ's church, but also of his condescension in
   visiting it, as has been observed on verse 2. Now this garden here, is
   said to be a "garden of nuts;" a garden where nut-trees only grew; for
   the ancients had places appropriated to such trees, [788] and with
   propriety might be called nut-gardens; tho', by what follows, there
   seem to be vines and pomegranates, and other fruits, as well as nuts in
   this garden; nuts might be the principal tree whence it had its name.
   The words are by some [789] translated, "the pruned gardens," or "the
   gardens of pruning or shearing:" deriving the word from a root, which
   signifies to cut or sheer; and so signifies that it is a garden well
   dressed, and pruned, and kept in good order: and so indeed is Christ's
   church; and therefore is opposite to, and different from the field and
   vineyard of the sluggard (Prov. 24:30, 31), which was neither in good
   order, without nor within; without, its stone-wall, its fence, was
   broken down; and within, it was all overrun with thorns and nettles:
   but Christ's garden is in a much better case; for, 1. It is well fenced
   with sovereign powerful and distinguishing grace; nay, God himself is
   "a wall of fire" about it, and has appointed salvation for walls and
   bulwarks" all around it; so that it is strongly enclosed, and well
   secured from the "boar out of the wood" wasting it, and from " the wild
   beast of the field" devouring it. 2. It is well planted; it is not an
   empty garden within, but is well stored with plants of all sorts, and
   those the most excellent, as appears from chap. 4:13,14, it is filled
   with "trees of righteousness," which are laden with the fruit thereof,
   and therefore are very valuable. 3. It is well pruned; for as Christ is
   the vine, the principal plant in this garden, on which all others grow,
   and from whence they receive their life and nourishment; so Christ's
   "Father is the husbandman, the vine-dresser, the keeper of the garden,
   and he keeps the plants in good order; for "every branch that beareth
   not fruit," he lops it off, and taketh it away; and "every branch that
   beareth fruit, he purgeth," or pruneth it, "that it may bring forth
   more fruit (John 15:1, 2). 4. It is well watered; as the Lord is the
   keeper of it, so he "waters it every moment" with the refreshing dews
   and delightful showers of divine line and grace; there as a fountain in
   the midst of it to water all the beds, and this is Christ himself; who
   therefore, in chapter 4:15, is called the "fountain of gardens;" who
   also is the "well of living waters;" and whose grace is as streams from
   Lebanon:" so that every" particular believer, every plant here, is
   "like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters fail
   not." 5. It is well weeded; there are tares grow up in Christ's field,
   and weeds in his garden, such as hypocrites and carnal professors; and
   Christ sometimes weeds his garden of many of these; and that by causing
   the sun of persecution to arise upon them, which scorches and burns
   them up, they not having root in themselves; he sometimes takes his fan
   in his hand, and with it purges his flower of the chaff, and clears his
   churches of such sort of persons as these; but this he will do more
   effectually at the last day, when he shall send his angels to "gather
   out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity,"
   (Matthew 13:41).

   Moreover, by these well-dressed or pruned gardens may be meant, those
   particular churches of Christ, which are regularly formed, are in good
   order, and are well disciplined; whose members are lively in the
   exercise of their faith, walk agreeably in their lives and
   conversations; are zealous for the truths of the gospel, and for the
   maintaining the ordinances of it in their purity; and are not remiss in
   dealing with offenders, whether they be immoral in their lives, or
   erroneous in their principles, such were. in a great measure, the
   churches of Ephesus, and Colosse (see Rev. 2:3; Col. 2:5), and with
   such churches Christ delights to be; and these may expect his presence.

   But the word, [790] though only used in this place, is by Jewish
   writers generally rendered a nut; and so it is by the Septuagint, as
   well as by our translators and others: this is very properly taken
   notice of in this love-poem; it being usual for new-married persons to
   get nuts, and throw them among children to make pastime; and to
   signify, among other things, that they now renounced childish things.
   [791] And by the garden, is meant the church of Christ, as has been
   observed before; and by the nuts which grow in this garden, from whence
   it has the name of a nut-garden, are meant believers; who may be called
   so, for the following reasons: 1. Because though they are mean and
   abject without, yet are glorious and valuable within: the "king's
   daughter is all glorious;" the inside of a believer, like that of the
   nut, is the best part of him: the outward appearance of saints is but
   mean, and the world judging according to that, not capable of seeing
   any farther, look upon them as the off-scouring of all things: but
   Christ, who knows their inside as well as their outside, knows what
   they are by his grace, as well as what they are by nature, that though
   they are black in themselves, yet are comely in him; he reckons them
   the excellent in the earth, in whom is all his delight. 2. Because of
   their several coverings: in the nut there are the husk and shell, and
   besides these, an inward covering; believers have several coverings;
   they have the robe of Christ's righteousness to cover them, which may
   answer the shell of the nut; being lasting and durable, will abide for
   ever, and will bring the soul that is enwrapped in it safe to glory:
   there is also "the new man," or garment of sanctification, which is put
   on by the believer; and this may answer the inward covering of the nut,
   as being more thin and tender, weak and imperfect: and then there is
   likewise the outward garment of a gospel-conversation; and this may
   answer the husk of the nut, as being the coarser and more imperfect
   covering, which, continually needs washing in Christ's blood. 3.
   Because of their hardiness in enduring afflictions: they wade through a
   sea of troubles in this world, before they enter the kingdom; and this
   they do with becoming cheerfulness, patience, courage, and magnanimity
   of mind; they "are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; are
   perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down,
   but not destroyed," (2 Cor. 4:8, 9) and that because they are supported
   under all these trials and exercises, and carried above them by a
   superior power. 4. Because of their hiddenness; the best part of the
   nut is hid: the saints are hid from everlasting, in the bosom of the
   Father, in the hands of the Son, and in the everlasting covenant of
   grace; until they are made openly to appear to be the people of God, by
   powerful and efficacious grace in conversion, and therefore are called
   God's "hidden ones;" and after conversion they are hid from the men of
   the world; the work of grace upon their souls is hid from them, and
   therefore called "the hidden man of the heart;" their joys and comforts
   are hid from them, and so indeed is their whole life of grace here, as
   well as their life of glory hereafter: for though they are "the sons of
   God, yet it does not appear" so fully to themselves, much less to the
   men of the world, "what they shall be." 5. Because of the safety and
   security both of their persons and their graces: nuts, in the greatest
   showers of rain, have only their outside washed the more, but their
   inside remains untouched, and is no ways hurt; so saints are safe and
   secure, notwithstanding all the floods, storms, and tempests of
   temptations, persecutions and afflictions; being built upon the rock,
   Christ Jesus, and hid in him, the ark of the covenant; the inward
   principle of grace in them cannot be lost; that hidden seed is
   incorruptible, and will abide so for ever. 6. Nuts often grow in
   clusters; which may not only denote the multitude of believers, and
   their close adherence to Christ, his gospel, cause and interest; but
   also their unity among themselves: and as it is a very pleasant and
   delightful sight to see nuts grow in clusters; so it is much more to
   see "brethren dwell together in unity." 7. Saints being compared to
   nuts, and to those of the best sort which grow in gardens, shows, that
   they have not only the shell of an outward profession, but also the
   kernel of true grace: some have only "the form of godliness, but deny
   the power thereof; profess to know God in words, but in works deny
   him;" have a name to live, but yet are dead; but such are not these who
   are here compared to nuts. 8. Their being compared to nuts, may denote
   their preservation from the pollution of the world, though in the midst
   of them: as a nut, though it may fall into the mire and dirt, yet the
   inside is no ways defiled therewith; so R. Solomon Jarchi, out of the
   Midrashes [792] explains these words of the impollution of the works of
   the Israelites, when they were in captivity among the nations of the
   world. 9. The kernel of the nut does not appear, [793] until the shell
   be broke: the graces of God's children generally show themselves most
   when they are under afflictions; for "tribulation worketh patience, and
   patience experience, and experience hope;" that is, makes those graces
   to appear more in their lively exercise; even as spice smells most when
   beaten in a mortar: moreover, this rich treasure of divine grace, which
   is put into our "earthen vessels," will not be so clearly seen, until
   these vessels are broken in pieces; nor will the soul appear so
   beautiful and glorious, being clothed with Christ's righteousness, and
   adorned with the graces of his Spirit, as when it is dislodged from
   "the earthly house of its tabernacle," and is joined with the spirits
   of just men made perfect." 10. Some [794] think, that not the common
   nuts, but the fruit, which we call nutmegs, are here intended; but such
   nuts grew not in those parts: rather, walnuts are meant, which the
   Arabs call gauz or geuz, which is the same word that is here used; as
   walnuts were in great esteem in the eastern countries, among the
   gardens Solomon had (Eccl. 2:7), one might be appropriated to these;
   and at Etham, about two miles from Jerusalem, Solomon had gardens, into
   which he had used to go early in a morning, as Josephus [795] relates:
   pistacia-nuts were well known in Syria, [796] which joined to Judea,
   and which might have a part in this garden: nuts grew in Judea, of
   which Josephus [797] makes mention, as in great plenty; and they are
   reckoned among the beat fruits of the land of Canaan (Gen. 43:11), and
   if nutmegs were designed, they might be expressive of the fragrancy and
   sweet odor of the saints, as they are clothed with Christ's garments
   which smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;" and as they are perfumed with
   "his ointments," which are exceeding savory. But,

   II.Let us consider the end of Christ's going down into this garden of
   nuts; which is,

   1st, "To see the fruits of the valley." By fruits, are meant the graces
   of the Spirit; the growth, actings and exercises of which, Christ went
   down to take notice of: and these are said to be the "fruits of the
   valley," because they grow upon humble souls, with whom Christ delights
   to be, and on whom he bestows more grace; though it is a wonderful
   instance of his grace and condescension to vouchsafe a regard to such
   poor, low, mean, and worthless creatures (see Isa. 57:15, 66:1, 2).
   Some interpreters translate the words, "the shoots or fruits of the
   brook or river; [798] agreeable enough to the Hebrew word, [799] which
   signifies a torrent, as well as a valley; and so are expressive of the
   fertile soil in which believers are planted, and which is the occasion
   of their fruitfulness (see Ps. 1:3).

   2dly, "To see whether the vine flourished." In what sense particular
   churches or believers in Christ may be compared to vines, has been
   shown on chapter 2:13, who may be said to flourish, when they increase
   in number, gifts and grace, and become fruitful in every good word and
   work, which Christ much looks after in his churches and in particular
   persons.

   3dly, To see whether "the pomegranates budded." By pomegranates are
   meant believers; see chapter 4:13, and by their budding, the beginnings
   or first putting forth of grace in them; which Christ takes much notice
   of, and is highly well pleased with. And from all this may be observed,
   1. The particular care and notice which Christ takes of his plants; he
   misses none, but goes from one to another; observes them all in what
   case they are, takes notice of the meanest, as well as the greatest;
   the fruits of the valley, as well as the vines and pomegranates. 2.
   That Christ is well pleased with the fruitfulness of them; he has been
   at a great deal of labor and expense to make them so; for this purpose
   he has made, planted, dunged and watered this garden: and now it must
   be some pleasure to him, to see of the travail of his soul, and to have
   the pleasure of the Lord prosper in his hands;" for as herein is his
   Father glorified, so herein is he well pleased, that his people "bring
   forth much fruit," (see John 15:8; Col. 1:10). 3. That he particularly
   takes notice of the first appearances and budding of grace in young
   converts; these he has a tender regard for, and takes a more than
   ordinary care of; see chapter 2:15, Isaiah 40:11 and 42:3. 4. That
   Christ has plants of various sorts and different growths in his garden;
   some vines, some pomegranates, and some nut-trees: all have gifts and
   grace differing one from another; some have ripe fruit upon them,
   others are blossoming, and some are but just budding forth. 5. Yet they
   are all fruit-bearing trees in Christ's garden: there are none else
   mentioned here; and there are none in it, which are of his planting,
   but what are fruitful. Seeing then that Christ does so narrowly inspect
   the plants and trees in his garden, and expects fruit from every one of
   them; how much should we be concerned to be "filled with the fruits of
   righteousness!" lest when he comes into his garden, and finds no fruit
   upon us, neither in the blossom nor in the bud, he should give orders
   to cut us down for cumber-ground (Luke 12:6, 7).

Chapter 6 Verse 12

   Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are either the words of the church, or else the words of
   Christ: if we consider them as the words of the church, then they may
   be expressive, either,

   1st, Of that rapture which her soul was in, in the views of those
   heavenly joys which, some [800] think, she had been taking notice of,
   and meditating upon in the former verse; which, whilst she was doing,
   "or ever she was aware," her soul took wing, and fled as swiftly in
   thought [801] towards those happy regions, as ever the chariots of
   Amminadib ran: she seems to be in much such an ecstasy as the apostle
   Paul was (2 Cor. 12:2-4), when he was "caught up into the third heaven,
   and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to
   utter;" who then knew not whether he was "in the body" or "out of the
   body," and therefore in his account of it, leaves it as a thing only
   known to God; so she here says, "or ever I was aware," or, as it is in
   the Hebrew text "I knew not;" [802] that is, scarce where I was, or,
   whither I was going; or whither I was in the body or out of the body, I
   cannot tell; so sudden was the snatch, so surprising the rapture, that
   I cannot tell what better to compare it to, than the swift run of
   Amminadib's chariots. Or,

   2dly, Of her ignorance where Christ was, and yet her diligence in
   seeking of him; "I knew not, that is, where my beloved was: he departed
   from me, and was absent a considerable time, and I could hear no
   tidings of him; it is true, I had heard him say that he was come into
   his garden; but, alas! through my drowsiness and sleep I had entirely
   forgot it, until discoursing with the daughters of Jerusalem about him,
   it came fresh into my mind; but even then, when I knew not where he
   was, "my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib;" I ran about here
   and there in search of him until I found him, as swiftly as ever his
   chariots did; see chapter 3:1, 2 and 5:6-8, 9. Or else,

   3dly, Of that prodigious haste she made, as soon as ever she knew where
   he was; and it is as if she should say, As soon as ever I understood
   that my beloved was gone down into his garden, to take a view of the
   trees and plants which grow there sudden, as it were and of the fruits
   of it; immediately, on a at unawares, such was the strength of my love
   and affection to him, that I moved as swiftly after him as if I had
   been in one of the chariots of Amminadib. Or,

   4thly, Of her courage and resolution in surmounting all difficulties
   for the sake of him: love makes persons bold and oaring; "perfect
   love," as the apostle says (1 John 4:18), "casts out fear;" and so it
   did in her; for she feared nothing that might befall her, and what did,
   did not discourage her; for though she was abused by the watchmen, and
   unveiled by the keepers of the walls, yet she drove on as briskly and
   as courageously as ever Amminadib drove on his chariots in the field of
   battle. Or,

   5thly, They may be expressive of the modesty and humility of the
   church, in not thinking that such praises as those which had been given
   her, both by Christ and by the virgins in the preceding verses,
   belonged to her; "I knew not;" I did not think, being conscious to
   myself of my own imperfections, that such commendations belonged to me;
   but finding that they did, nay soul made the greater haste to answer
   those characters, and to enjoy the company of him whom I dearly love;
   and therefore she takes her leave of the virgins, her companions, who
   had hitherto accompanied her in the search of her beloved, that she
   might be alone with him; which occasioned them to say, in the following
   words "Return, return, O Shulamite, return, return, that we may look
   upon thee." Though I rather think, that these are the words of Christ,
   as those in verse 11, also are; who, having gone down into his garden,
   to observe the fruitfulness of the trees and plants of it, declares in
   these words in what case he found them, or rather, in what he did not;
   "I knew not," or I did not perceive them to be in a fruitful and
   flourishing condition: and to this purpose Junius and Tremellius read
   the words, Nondum percipientem haec, "Not yet perceiving these things;"
   that is, the vines to flourish, or the pomegranates to bud; therefore
   his soul put him upon using speedy methods to bring his garden, and the
   plants of it, into a more fruitful condition. From whence we may
   observe, 1. That sometimes there may be but little fruitfulness
   appearing in the churches of Christ: faith may be very low, as to its
   actings and exercise; the life and power of godliness may be much
   decayed; there may be but little warmth, zeal and activity for Christ,
   his gospel, cause and interest; the ministry of the word may meet with
   but small success; so that there may be no pomegranates budding, as
   well as no vines flourishing. But, 2. Christ will not always leave his
   churches in such a condition; but will make haste unto them, and bring
   them into a more fruitful state; he will come and revive his work upon
   the hearts of his people, and make them fruitful in every good word and
   work; he will bless the ministry of the word, not only for comfort and
   edification, so as his vines shall flourish, but also for conversion,
   so that the pomegranates shall bud forth. And, 3. It may be observed,
   that it is Christ's presence that makes churches fruitful: as his
   absence causes a winter-season, both with churches and particular
   believers; so his presence is as the returning spring which renews the
   face of the earth, causes the flowers to appear above ground; the
   pomegranates to bud, and the vines to put forth their tender grapes; he
   is that sun of righteousness," by whose warm and quickening beams of
   light and love, souls " grow up as calves of the stall."

   Moreover, these words may be expressive of that transport of love, with
   which Christ was filled towards his church, which caused him so
   speedily to return to her, as is here intimated; "or ever I was aware,"
   that is, on a sudden, and in a surprising manner, my love and affection
   to my church broke eat and discovered itself; which powerfully moved
   and inclined me to make speedy haste unto her, and afford her all the
   assistance I could, as well as grant her my presence, which she was so
   desirous of: not that we are to suppose that any thing comes to Christ
   at unawares, or is done inadvertently by him; but this he says to show
   the strength of his love, and in what a sudden and surprising manner it
   brake forth towards his church and people. And in these words may be
   considered these three things:

   I.What it was that put him upon this speedy return to his church; "my
   soul made me," etc.

   II.In what manner this was effected, or what his soul made him to his
   church, in his return to her; it made him "like the chariots of
   Amminadib."

   III.Whose chariots these are which Christ's soul made him like unto, or
   set him upon; or rather, who the persons are to whom his soul made him
   as chariots.

   I.In these words we have an account of what it was that moved him to,
   or put him upon this speedy return to his church; which was not any
   worth or worthiness, love or loveliness in her; it was not her grace,
   nor the exercise of it, considered in themselves, but his own soul that
   moved him to it; that is, that love and affection which he bore in his
   own heart towards her; it was this that moved him first to undertake.
   her cause, assume her nature, and die in her room and stead; and it is
   this which causes him to manifest himself in a way of grace, and pay
   those love-visits to her, which he frequently does.

   II.The manner in which this was effected, or what his soul made him to
   his church and people, may he here also observed; it made him "like the
   chariots of Amminadib." 1. Like these chariots he moved swiftly to her:
   Christ is a "present help" to his people in their time of need; he
   helps them, "and that right early;" he makes haste, and delays not to
   afford them his assistance; for which reason he is said to be as "a roe
   or a young hart, leaping upon the mountains, and skipping upon the
   hills," in chapter 2:8, 9. 2. He is like chariots to support, bear up
   and carry his people; he takes them up in his chariots of salvation,
   and carries them through all the troubles and difficulties of this
   life, safe to glory, as he himself declares he will, in Isaiah 46:3, 4.
   3. He is as chariots to them, to protect and defend them from their
   enemies: That which chariots and horses are to others, that is Christ
   to them, and much more so; whilst some trust in chariots, and others in
   horses, they trust in the name of the Lord their God; who comes with
   his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his
   rebuke with flames of fire," (Isa. 66:15). 4. It may denote the majesty
   and glory in which he visited her; which, as it was an instance of his
   condescension, so it was putting an honor upon her; that one so great
   as he, who is the King of kings, and Lord of lords, should visit one so
   poor and mean as she.

   III.It may also be considered whose chariots these are, which Christ's
   soul made him like unto, or who the persons are to whom his soul made
   him as chariots. Some take Amminadib here to be the proper name of a
   person; [803] who perhaps was one of Solomon"s chariot-drivers, and was
   famous in that way; was an artist in it, and who, Jehu-like, drove on
   swiftly, and furiously; and therefore Christ, speedily returning to his
   church, compares himself thereunto. Though I rather think, with R. Aben
   Ezra Jarchi, and others, that it should be considered as two words,
   thus, ammi, which signifies my people, and nadib, willing or princely;
   and so the words may be rendered, "the chariots of my willing or
   princely people. And this may be understood, either,

   1st, Of angels, who are Christ's willing people; who are always ready
   to do his pleasure, obey his orders, and execute his commands with the
   utmost cheerfulness and alacrity imaginable (see Ps. 103:20, 21), and
   therefore, one of the petitions in that prayer, which Christ directed
   his disciples to, is, that God's will might " be done on earth, as it
   is in heaven." These are also the chariots of the Lord, as is manifest
   from Psalm 68:17. The chariots of the Lord are twenty thousand, even
   thousands of angels: These are made use of by him in a providential
   way, to execute his will, and do his pleasure (see Zech. 6:5), and so
   they are in a way of grace; they are made use of by him to carry
   messages of grace to his people; for they are "all ministering spirits,
   sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation." These
   are his chariots, which he sends out to bring his children home; in
   these Elijah was conducted, body and soul, to glory; for the chariots
   and horses of fire, which carried him thither, were no other than
   angels, who appeared in such a form; by whom also Lazarus was carried
   into Abraham's bosom; and perhaps Christ might here make use of the
   ministry of angels, and ride in these chariots in this discovery of
   himself to his church. Or else,

   2dly, It may be meant of the ministers of Christ; who preach Christ and
   his gospel freely; "not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
   lucre, but of a ready mind." These may be called the chariots of the
   Lord; as Elijah, in 2 Kings 2:12, is called the "chariot and horsemen
   of Israel:" and they may be called so, because they bear the name of
   Christ, and carry and spread his gospel throughout the world, and are
   his chariots to bring home souls unto him, as the trophies of his grace
   (see Isa. 66:20), and in which Christ frequently rides and shows
   himself unto his people. Though,

   3dly, I should rather think, that the people of Christ themselves are
   here intended, whom Christ is as chariots to; for so I think the words
   may very well be rendered, "or ever I was aware, my soul made me as
   chariots to my willing or princely people;" and so it points out the
   persons who shared in this instance of his grace: and these are said,
   in Psalm 110:3, to be "a willing people in the day of his power;" and
   they may be called so, 1. Because they are made willing to part with
   sin: This God requires, but man is naturally loth to do it; for sin is
   a sweet morsel in his mouth; "he hides it under his tongue, be spares
   and forsakes it not, but keeps it still within his mouth;" but when the
   Spirit of God convinces him of the exceeding sinfulness of it rhea what
   was before sweet, is now bitter; and what was delightful is now odious;
   and what his soul adored, it now abhors, and says, as in Hosea 14:8
   with Ephram, "What have I to do any more with idols?" 2. Because they
   are made willing to part with sinful companions: This is what God calls
   his people to; but is a thing that is not so easily complied with,
   until by mighty grace they are made willing to it; for it is no other
   than a forsaking a man's own people, and his father's house; besides a
   great deal of reproach is cast upon them for so doing; for "he that
   departs from evil, maketh himself a prey;" but when the spirit of God
   convinces the soul of the necessity of parting with such company, and
   the danger of continuing in it; it is not only willing to do it, but
   also laments that it has been so long in it, saying, as in Psalm
   120:5,6. "Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
   of Kedar!" 3. Because they are made willing to part with their own
   righteousness; not in point of obedience, but in point of dependence;
   not as ornamental to the Christian, but as constitutive of him; not as
   it glorifies God, but as it is made use of as a plea with him, either
   for grace here, or glory hereafter: again, not as it is a guard or
   fence against the reproaches of men, but as matter of boasting before
   God; not as it is agreeable to God's law, but as it is opposite to
   God's revealed method of justifying sinners by his Son-righteousness:
   but this, man is not naturally willing to; it goes against him to part
   with it, because this is most agreeable to nature; it is his own
   offspring, the effect of great labor and toil, and what affords matter
   of boasting to him; but when the Spirit of God convinces him of the
   weakness and insufficiency of it, and shows him the glory and fullness
   of Christ's righteousness; he then desires with the apostle Paul (Phil.
   3:9), to be "found in him, not having on his own righteousness, which
   is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ." 4.
   Because they are willing to be saved alone by Christ: man is naturally
   for bringing his own works, either as the sole cause of, or as partners
   with Christ in salvation-work; but when souls are made to see the
   imperfection of these, and that salvation is only by Christ, and in no
   other, their language is, "Ashur shall not save us; we desire to be
   saved no other way than by Christ;" and therefore they say, with Job,
   chapter 13:15,16, "though he slay us, yet will we trust in him; he also
   shall be our salvation." 5. Because they are as willing to serve Christ
   as they are to be saved by him; and this, not from fear of punishment,
   but from a principle of love the love of Christ constrains them to it;
   nor do they perform it in a servile mercenary way, but freely; not as a
   task, but as a pleasure: for to them wisdom's "ways are ways of
   pleasantness, and her paths are paths of peace." 6. Because they are
   willing to bear the cross of Christ; this Christ requires of them, and
   this they readily and voluntarily submit unto: Christ's cross is to
   them preferable to crowns and kingdoms: with Moses (Heb. 11:25, 26),
   they choose "rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than
   to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season." Now to such a free and
   willing people as these Christ makes himself as chariots.

   But again, the word may be rendered, "my princely people;" and such are
   the people of Christ (see Ps. 113:7, 8), they are all princes, being
   the sons of a king; they are all heirs to a kingdom, have a crown of
   life, righteousness and glory laid up for them, and a throne of glory
   prepared for them to inherit; they wear princely robes, enjoy princely
   fare, and have a princely equipage; the angels of the Lord attend them
   continually as their life-guard. So the church is said to be a prince's
   daughter, in chapter 7:1, and to her Christ here make himself as
   chariots, and takes her up along with him, that she might enjoy his
   delightful company, which she had so long sought after, and so much
   desired; which occasioned the daughters of Jerusalem, who had hitherto
   accompanied her in the search of him, to say, in the following words:

Chapter 6 Verse 13

   Return, return, O Shulamite, return, return, that we may look upon
   thee: What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of
   two armies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words consist of two parts:

   I.A call, either of Christ or of the daughters of Jerusalem, to the
   church, to return, that they might have a full view of her.

   II.A reply to that call, which is made by proposing a question, and
   returning an answer to it.

   I.Here is a call, either of Christ or of the daughters, to the church,
   to return, that they might have a full view of her: in which may be
   considered,

   First, The name she is called by, or the title and appellation which is
   given to her, Shulamite. Secondly, What she is called upon to do; and
   that is, to return, which is repeated over and over. Thirdly, The end
   of it, which is, that they might "look upon her."

   First, The name she bears, or the title and application which is given
   her, is, Shulamite; and she may be called so, for the following
   reasons:

   1st, Because she was an inhabitant of Salem or Jerusalem: [804] as the
   woman with whom Elisha lodged, is called a Shunamite from her dwelling
   in Shunem; so the church is here called a Shulamite or a Jerusalemite,
   from her dwelling in Salem or Jerusalem: Jerusalem was formerly called
   Salem; so it was in Melchizedek's time, as is thought, who was king of
   that place; which ancient name of it is mentioned by the Psalmist, in
   Psalm 76:2, "in Salem also is his tabernacle." And now it is no wonder
   that the church, or any particular believer, should be called a
   Shulamite, seeing the church, both in the Old and New Testament,
   frequently bears the name of Jerusalem; so that to be a Shulamite, is
   to be a "fellow-citizen of the saints, and of the household of God,"
   and to share in all the privileges and immunities thereof, as they do;
   who, besides the company of angels, and conversation of saints, enjoy
   the presence of Father, Son, and Spirit; and share in all the blessings
   of the everlasting covenant; for to the Shulamites, these natives of
   Zion, or inhabitants of Jerusalem, do these properly belong (see Isa.
   33:24; Zech. 13:1).

   2dly, Because she was the wife of the true Solomon, Christ Jesus. This
   is thought by some, [805] to be the same with Solomon, having a
   feminine termination, which suits well with her: and as it is a common
   thing for the wife to have the same name with the husband; so it is no
   unusual thing for the church to be called by the same name as Christ
   is; Is he the Solomon? She's the Shulamite: Is he Jehovah our
   righteousness? this is also the name wherewith she is called: See
   Jeremiah 22:6, compared with chapter 33:16, hence it is, that she
   shares in all the blessings he is possessed of, and in every thing he
   has a property in: for Christ being hers, all that he has is hers.

   3dly, The word [806] flora whence this is derived, signifies both
   perfection and peace; so that she may be called the Shulamite, from
   that perfection, and peace which she enjoys in and through Christ. 1.
   She may be called so from that perfection, which She is or shall be
   possessed of; "Return, return, O Shulamite;" or, "O thou perfect one;"
   who art an accomplished beauty, being the perfection of it; whose
   renown is gone forth among the heathen for it; for thy beauty is
   perfect, through the comeliness which the Lord hath put upon thee. Now
   the church may be said to be a Shulamite, a perfect one, these several
   ways: (1.) Not as she is in herself, but as she is in Christ; as she is
   in herself, she is black, but as she is in Christ, she is comely; as
   she is in herself, she is imperfect, but as she is in him, she is
   complete; as she is in herself, she is full of spots, but as she is in
   him, she is all fair, and without spot." (2.) She is perfect: not as
   considered in her own righteousness, but as considered in Christ's; as
   she is considered in her own, she is perfect, that being so; which she
   frankly acknowledges, saying (Isa. 64:6), "we are all as an unclean
   thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags;" but as she is
   considered in Christ's righteousness, she is perfect, being completely
   justified, acquitted., and discharged thereby from all sin; and so may
   be justly reckoned among the number "of the spirits of just men made
   perfect." (3.) She may be said to be perfect: not absolutely as in
   herself, but comparatively, with regard to others: so saints may be
   said to be perfect, when compared either with themselves before
   conversion, or with hypocrites and carnal professors, or with the
   profane men of the world: so Job, though he may be said to be "a
   perfect and an upright man "on the account of his having Christ's
   righteousness upon him, and the truth of grace within him; yet he may
   also be said to be so, as being compared with the men of that
   generation in which he lived; and therefore the Lord says of him,
   "there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man."
   (4.) She may be said to be perfect, or, with a perfection of parts, but
   not of degrees; it is true, the believer has a complete sanctification
   in Christ, but not in himself: moreover, every part, power and faculty
   of the soul, may be sanctified, but not wholly, or to that degree as it
   shall be: the new creature is formed in all its parts, but it is not
   yet grown up to be "a perfect man in Christ;" it is not adult, it is as
   yet in its nonage, in its infancy." (5.) She may be called the
   Shulamite, or "the perfect one," not as she is now, but as she shall be
   hereafter; for though saints "are now the sons of God, it does not vet
   appear what they shall be;" they are now in some measure like to
   Christ, but then they shall be perfectly like unto him; they have now
   spots upon them, but then they shall be without spot or wrinkle, or any
   such thing;" they will then. appear to be complete in Christ, and to be
   " the fullness of him," as the church is called, in Ephesians 1:23,
   which then she may be said to be, when all the elect are called by
   grace, and not one member of the body is missing; and when all these
   members are filled with all the gifts and graces of the Spirit in their
   measure, and are all grown up to a just proportion in the body. 2. She
   may be called the Shulamite, [807] from that peace which she does or
   shall enjoy in and through Christ. (1.) She may be called so from that
   peace which she has through Christ: who is her peace, and has made
   peace for her through the "blood of his cross," and thereby has
   reconciled her unto God; so that being now "justified by faith" in his
   blood and righteousness, she has " peace with God, through our Lord
   Jesus Christ." (2.) From that peace which she has from Christ; who
   gives unto her such a peace as the world can neither give nor take
   away: "Peace I leave with you," says Christ (John 14:27), "my peace I
   give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you;" which is such
   an one as the believer can experience, even in the midst of the world's
   frowns, troubles and persecutions: this is a peace which "passeth all
   understanding;" and which is spoken only by the blood of Jesus, that
   speaketh better things than that of Abel;" and which the God of peace
   gives to men, by leading their faith to the person, blood and
   righteousness of Christ. (3.) From that peace which she does or should
   enjoy in her members: who ought to endeavor "to keep the unity of the
   spirit in the bond of peace;" which they will do, if "the peace of God
   rules in their hearts," as it should do; for hereunto are they called.
   (4.) From that peace which she is entitled to, and shall enjoy
   hereafter; for though this world is a world of trouble to the believer,
   yet he is no sooner out of it, but "he enters into peace;" and into
   such an one as will never be interrupted and broke in upon, either by
   sin, Satan, or the world; for "mark but the upright and perfect man,"
   the true Shulamite, "for the end of that man is peace." But,

   Secondly, Let us now consider what is said unto this Shulamite; and
   that is, "return, return:" which, if we understand as the words of
   Christ, may be expressive, either, 1. Of the spiritual return of his
   church and people to him after sin and backslidings; which sense is
   favored by the Targum or Chaldee paraphrase upon this place; and also
   suits with the former state and condition of the church, who was fallen
   into a piteous frame of spirit, was sleepy and drowsy, negligent of her
   duty, and slighting Christ, for which reason he departed from her; but
   now returning himself, invites her to return also to him; which shows
   the exceeding greatness of his love unto her, and tenderness for her;
   and therefore to answer all objections, and remove all discouragements,
   he not only speaks to her in such loving and endearing language; but
   also repeats the call over and over, to shew how earnestly desirous he
   was of it, as well as the haste and speed he would have her make in it
   (see Jer. 3:1-12; Hosea 14:1-4). Or, 2. Of the conversion of the Jews:
   [808] The name by which the church is here called, may more especially
   intend the Jewish church; and the words, "return, return," aptly
   represent the present state of the Jews, who are in a state of
   blindness, impenitence and unbelief; and have not only veils over their
   heads, but also over their hearts, when the law of Moses is read and
   expounded among them; they have their backs turned upon God, and their
   hearts set against the true Messiah, Christ Jesus: moreover, their
   conversion is expressed both in the Old and New Testament, by a turning
   or a returning unto the Lord (see Hosea 3:5; 2 Cor. 3:16); and the
   repetition of these words, "return, return," not only shows the power
   and haste in which this shall be accomplished; for then shall that
   prophecy be fulfilled, which is mentioned with so much wonder and
   surprise, in Isaiah 66:8. "Who hath heard such a thing? Who hath seen
   such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or
   shall a nation be born at once?" but also their being repealed four
   times, [809] may denote the collection of the Jews, at the time of
   their conversion, from the four corners of the earth (see Isa. 11:12).
   I rather think, that these are the words of the daughters of Jerusalem,
   who, perceiving that the church was going away from them, call after
   her to return from them; they first meet with her in the time of her
   beloved's absence from her, and had accompanied her in her search after
   him hitherto; but not having met with her beloved, who had made himself
   unto her as "the chariots of Amminadib," she takes her leave of them,
   and in all haste goes along with him; which they observing, car to her
   after this manner: or else, these daughters having observed how the
   church, through modesty and shamefacedness, "being conscious of her
   former treatment of Christ, hang down her head, and hid her face, as
   blushing and being ashamed to look up, being now in his presence; they
   call to her to turn, as some [810] tender the word; that is, to turn
   her face, that they might behold the beauty and glory of it. Which
   leads us to consider,

   Thirdly, The end of this call, which is, that they might "look upon
   her:" and if we take them to be the words of Christ, then the we are
   either the Trinity of Persons, Father, Son and Spirit; who are all well
   pleased with returning sinners, look upon them with delight and
   pleasure, and grant them communion and fellowship with them: or else,
   Christ and his angels, who, together with Christ, not only rejoice at
   the conversion of profane stoners, but also at the return of
   backsliding ones: or else, he and the daughters, :her companions; who,
   as well as he, were in love with her, and with wonder gazed at her.
   Though they seem rather to be the words of the daughters themselves;
   who here express their desire of seeing her, and therefore call to her
   to return unto them: [811] they had heard very great commendations of
   the church's beauty, in the preceding verses, which had excited desires
   more narrowly to look upon, and take a fuller view of her, than
   hitherto they had done: as also, that they might again enjoy her
   company and conversation, which had been so useful and instructive to
   them; and which, they might imagine, would be. more so, seeing she had
   so lately met with Christ, and had some fresh experiences of his love
   to her. So much for the first part of the words.

   II.Here is a reply made to this call of Christ, or of the virgins to
   the church, to return; which is done, 1st, By proposing a question,
   "What will ye see in the Shulamite?" 2dly, By returning an answer to
   it, "as it were the company of two armies."

   1st, A reply is made, by proposing this question, "What will ye see in
   the Shulamite?" which is done either by Christ; who was best able to
   answer it; and this he does, not as being ignorant of what was to be
   seen in his church, nor with a design to lessen his church's glory and
   excellency; but rather to heighten it, and to animate and excite the
   desires and affections of these virgins more strongly towards her: or
   else this question is put by the virgins, one to another; some of them
   wished for her return, and others asked what they would see, or what
   they expected to see in her. Though I rather think, it is put by the
   church herself; who, perceiving that the daughters were so very
   importunate with her to return to them, that they might look upon her;
   ask what they could expect to see in her, who was in herself and in her
   own opinion, such a poor, mean and unworthy creature; not fit to be
   looked upon, there being nothing in her that was extraordinary, or
   indeed valuable, or worth seeing;

   2dly, An answer is returned unto this question, thus, "As it were the
   company of two armies;" which is either given by Christ as an answer to
   his own, or to the daughters question, and that with a design to set
   forth the glory and majesty of the church: should it be asked, as if he
   should say, What is to be seen in my church? I answer, a great deal of
   glory; for though she is militant, yet she is "terrible as an army with
   banners;" nay, there is as much stateliness and majesty to be Seen in
   her, as in two armies set in battle array; or else, they are the answer
   of the virgins, one to another, declaring what they expected to see in
   Christ's spouse; and that is; either such a glorious and joyful meeting
   between Christ and his church, as is often, between great persons,
   which is frequently attended with singing and dancing; for the word
   translated company, [812] signifies a company of those who dance and
   sing and therefore is rendered by the Septuagint, coroi, choirs; an
   instance of which spiritual joy, signified by such metaphors, see in
   Psalm 68:24, 25, or as an army at the reception of their prince, for
   the sake of greater honor and majesty, divides itself into bands, or
   else, it was an angelic glory which they" expected to see in her, or to
   see her face as the angel of the Lord; which would be as delightful and
   refreshing a sight unto them, as that was which Jacob had, when he had
   just parted with Laban, and was in danger from his brother Esau; who
   (Gen. 32:1, 2), saw the angels of God as two bands, the one to go
   before, and the other behind him; and therefore he called the name of
   the place Mahanaim; which signifies two hosts or two armies, and is the
   same word that is here used; and to this history the allusion seems to
   be here made: or else, by this company of two armies, which these
   virgins expected to see, and were desirous of seeing in the church, may
   be meant, the union of Jews and Gentiles in one body; which will be
   effected in the latter day; and when it is, it wall be a glorious and
   delightful sight. Though I rather think, that both the question and the
   answer are the church's; who first asks what they could expect to see
   in her; and then replies, that nothing could be seen in her, but as it
   were the company of two armies; that is, flesh and spirit, grace and.
   sin, which were continually warring against, and opposing each other
   (see Rom. 7:23; Gal. 5:17); and this surely could be no pleasant or
   desirable sight, as she thought to them: but notwithstanding she had
   such a mean opinion of herself, yet very large and noble commendations
   are given of her in the following chapter, which fill up the greatest
   part of it; and thus it begins Chapter 7.

   In this chapter Christ gives a fresh commendation of the beauty of his
   church, in a different order and method than before: beginning with her
   feet, and so rising gradually upwards to the hair of her head, and to
   the roof of her mouth, verses 1-9. And then the church asserts her
   interest in him; and declares his desire towards her, verse 10 and
   invites him to go with her into the fields, villages, and vineyards;
   and offers various reasons, by which she urges him to a compliance with

Chapter 7 Verse 1

   How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the
   joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a
   cunning workman.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are either the words of the daughters of Jerusalem, who
   having desired the church to return unto them, in the latter part of
   the preceding chapter, that they might take a view of those
   incomparable and astonishing beauties, for which she had been
   commended; to which request, she complying, they now with wonder look
   upon her, and give those large commendations of her, which are in this
   and some following verses: and what seems still more to strengthen this
   sense of the words, Christ is spoken of in verse 5 as a distinct
   person, both from the person who is described, and also from the
   persons by whom the description is made. Though I rather think, that
   they are the words of Christ; who, observing his church think so
   meanly, and speak so modestly of herself, enters afresh upon the
   commendation of her beauties; to the end, that all her discouragements
   might be removed, her objections answered, and she be fully assured
   that she was as beautiful in his eyes, and as much the object of his
   love, as ever she was, notwithstanding her unkind treatment of him, and
   behavior to him. Moreover, it may be observed, that the title, which is
   given the church, in verse 6 does not suit well to come out of any
   other's mouth but Christ's, whose love peculiarly she is: nor indeed
   would it appear so proper to any as to Christ, to give such
   commendations of the church as here are given. And it is also worthy of
   our notice, that the order in which Christ proceeds here, in the
   description of the beauty of his church, is not only different from
   that method which she took in setting forth his glory, in chapter 5,
   but also from that which he himself took, when upon the same subject,
   in chapters 4:6, for as he there began with the hair of her head, her
   lips, teeth, cheeks, and temples, and so proceeded downwards; he here
   begins with her feet, and rises upwards: which may be, 1. To show that
   he takes notice of and has a value for the meanest members of his
   mystical body, the church; he takes notice of her feet, which, though
   they have the lowest place in the body, yet are not without their
   usefulness; "for the head cannot say to the feet, I have no need of
   you;" and as they are not without their usefulness, so neither are they
   without Christ's-notice; who has a real value, and has made provisions
   of grace for them, as well as for the other members of his body, and
   therefore appears in a garment down to the feet; which garment of his
   justifying righteousness, covers the feet and toes, as well as the
   other parts of the Body: nay, Christ not only takes notice of, and has
   a value for the meanest saints, but also for their meanest
   performances; he hears and despises not the prayers of his destitute
   ones: he bottles up their tears, and forgets not their labor of love
   towards his saints; such as visiting them when sick, feeding them when
   hungry, and clothing them then naked, nay, even the giving them a cup
   of cold water in the name of a disciple; all which he looks upon as
   done to himself, and will remember, and speak of them when they have
   forgotten, them, and at a time when they little thought to have heard
   of them. 2. It may be also to lead the church, together with the
   daughters of Jerusalem, gradually, by little and little, into the glory
   and beauty which she received from him; and so bring them to consider
   what glory and beauty he must be possessed of, from whom she received
   all hers; for if her feet with shoes were so beautiful, what must the
   other parts of her body be, which were still more gloriously adorned!
   and if she in all her parts was so glorious; what must he be who made
   her so! 3. He takes notice first of her feet, because she was now upon
   the return unto him after her backsliding from him, which was exceeding
   grateful to him: the returning prodigal was not more welcome to his
   father; who, seeing him afar off, ran and fell upon his neck, and
   kissed him; than a poor backsliding sinner is to Christ Jesus. 4. He
   inverts his former order and method, to show that the manifestations of
   his love are not always alike; he sometimes takes one way, and another
   and whether a believer is considered sometimes either one way or
   another, he is always beautiful in Christ, and in his eyes. But let us
   now consider the words themselves; in which may be observed,

   I.The noble and excellent title which is given her; "O prince's
   daughter!"

   II. The commendations of her; which are, 1st, Of her feet, and these
   are said to be "beautiful with shoes." 2dly, Of the joints of her
   thighs; which are said to be "as jewels, the work of the hands of a
   cunning workman."

   I. Here is a new and noble title given to her, "O prince's daughter!"
   Christ finds new names and titles for his spouse; and that not only to
   set forth her excellency the more, but also to express the largeness of
   his love and affection to her; who may well be called a prince's
   daughter, as she is the king's daughter in Psalm 45:13, and that
   because she is the daughter of the King of kings, and Lord of lords:
   and so she is, 1. By covenant grace, which makes her so; for God has in
   covenant made over himself unto his people, and declared that he will
   be their Father, and they shall be his sons and daughters; for even
   thus saith the Lord Almighty: and now that same grace, which has taken
   them into that relation, will make it appear manifestly that they are
   so, by bestowing all that grace which is laid up in covenant for them,
   and all that glory which is there provided for them. 2. By birth, or by
   the grace of regeneration: the church of Christ is a prince's daughter
   by birth, being born again, "not of blood, nor of the will of the
   flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God;" the original and descent of
   the children of God is not base, mean and low, but high and noble:
   those that are born again) are born a]noqen from above, as that word
   may be rendered; they are born heirs to an inheritance, that is not of
   this world, which is fading and perishing, but to one that is
   incorruptible, undefiled, and which fadeth not away, reserved in heaven
   for them: and as they are born, so they are brought up as the sons and
   daughters of kings and princes; they are brought up in the king's
   palace; they feed at his table, and participate of all his royal
   dainties; their clothing shows them to be such, which is all of wrought
   gold; as does also their equipage and retinue: who, besides the virgins
   or maids of honor to wait upon them, have also a guard of angels
   continually to attend them. 3. By adopting grace: angels are the sons
   of God by creation; but saints by adoption: they are predestinated to
   it; and by the Spirit of God, who is the spirit of adoption, are put
   into the possession of it, and reap the benefits, and enjoy the comfort
   of it, through his witnessing with their spirits, that they are the
   children of God; which is such a surprising instance of God's grace,
   that all who share in this privilege have reason to say, with the
   apostle John (1 John 3:1), "Behold what manner of love the Father hath
   bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God." 4. By
   marriage: The church is married to Christ, the eternal Son of God;
   whose titles are, "The Prince of peace, and the Prince of the kings of
   the earth:" so that she is both a prince's daughter, and a prince's
   wife; and is the former, by becoming the latter; she is espoused as a
   chaste virgin to Christ, who is the only Son of the king eternal,
   immortal, invisible, the only wise God.

   Moreover, the words may be rendered, "O noble, or princely daughter!"
   [813] that is, who art of a noble and princely spirit: and this is,
   (1.) A free spirit, in opposition to a servile one: and so the word is
   translated, in Psalm 51:12. "Uphold me with a free or princely spirit:"
   and such a spirit believers have, being freed from the servitude of sin
   and Satan; and being delivered from a spirit of bondage to a law of
   works, serve the Lord with all cheerfulness and readiness, being made a
   willing people in the day of his power. (2.) To be of a princely
   spirit, is to be of a free, noble, generous, bountiful and liberal
   spirit; and such a spirit saints have, not only in distributing their
   temporal things to the necessities of the poor, but also in
   communicating their spiritual things to the mutual comfort and
   edification of each other; so the word is rendered in Isaiah 32:5, 8.

   II. Having considered the title, it will be now proper to take notice
   of the commendations given her: 1st, Of her feet, which are said to be
   beautiful with shoes. 2dly, Of the joints of her thighs, which are said
   to be "as jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman."

   1st, Her feet with shoes are here commended: it is no unusual thing to
   describe the comeliness of women by their feet, and the ornaments of
   them; so Hebe is described by Homer, [814] as having beautiful feet;
   and Juno, by her golden shoes: particular care was taken of, and
   provision made for the shoes of queens and princesses in the eastern
   countries; Herodotus [815] relates, that the city of Anthylla was given
   peculiarly to the wife of the king of Egypt, to provide her with shoes:
   the Targum here is, purple shoes; and those of a red, scarlet or purple
   color, were in esteem with the Jews (Ezek. 16:10) and with the Tyrian
   virgins, their neighbors; [816] and also with the Romans, [817] with
   whom likewise white shoes [818] were much in use. By these feet with
   shoes may be meant, either, 1. The ministers of the gospel, [819] whose
   feet being shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, are
   exceeding beautiful, according to Isaiah 52:7. "How beautiful upon the
   mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that
   publisheth peace," etc. These are the church's feet, which run to and
   fro in the world, whereby the knowledge of Christ and his gospel is
   increased; which was eminently true of the apostles and first ministers
   of the gospel, who swiftly ran over the Gentile world; and wherever
   they came, diffused the savor of Christ's knowledge, and were
   instrumental in the conversion of thousands of souls; for their sound
   went into all the earth; and their words unto the ends of the world.
   And now these feet being said to be beautiful with shoes, may denote,
   (1.) The promptitude and readiness of Christ's ministers to preach the
   gospel: as the people of Israel, having their shoes upon their feet
   when they eat the passover, just when they departed out of Egypt,
   showed their readiness for their journey; so these feet of the church,
   having shoes on, show the readiness of the ministers of the gospel to,
   preach it in every place where they are called to it, tho' in the face
   of the greatest opposition; "I am ready," says the apostle Paul (Rom.
   1:16), "to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also;" his feet
   were shod with it, and he was prepared to preach it; even where not
   only the seat of the empire, but the seat of persecution was, where it
   was the hottest and raged the most furiously; and the reason he gives
   is, for, says he, "I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ;" no, not
   in Caesar's palace: faithful ministers are ready to preach it any
   where, and at any time; and are "instant in season and out of season;"
   they preach, "not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre,
   but of a ready mind." (2.) It shows their intrepidity in preaching the
   gospel; a man that "has his feet well shod", regards not the roughness
   of the way, nor the sharp stones which lie in it, nor the pricking
   briars and thorns through which he walks: the ministers of the gospel,
   whose feet are well shod with it, regard no difficulties that lie in
   their way, so as to be discouraged by them, and desist from their work;
   but, with the utmost courage and magnanimity of mind, bear and surmount
   them; with scorn and contempt they trample upon all the briars and
   thorns of reproaches and scandal .that are cast upon, and persecutions
   which are leveled against them; none of these things move them; neither
   do they count their lives dear to themselves; so that they may finish
   their course with joy, and the ministry, which they have received of
   the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. (3.) It is
   expressive of their beauty and glory: the ministers of the gospel are
   not only beautiful in the eyes of those to whom they are made useful,
   either for conversion or consolation; but also in the eyes of Christ;
   especially when they faithfully discharge their work; though they run
   the risk of losing their credit, honor and reputation in the world,
   nay, their lives also. Or else, 2. By these feet, may be meant the
   affections of the church towards Christ; [820] which are that unto the
   soul, as feet are to the body; these carry it up and down, hither and
   thither, at pleasure: and being said to be beautiful with shoes, show
   that they moved in an orderly way; constrained her to turn her feel to
   his testimonies, and enlarged her heart to run the way of his
   commandments; which made them appear exceeding beautiful to him, so
   that his heart was ravished with them; see chapter 4:9,10, the eyes of
   Holofernes are said to be ravished with the sandals upon Judith's feet,
   which she had put on, on purpose to deceive persons (see Judith 10:4,
   16:11), and this shows it to be the custom of women to adorn their
   shoes or sandals, that they might enamor their lovers; to which custom
   perhaps the allusion is here made. Or else, 3. By them may be meant the
   actings of faith on Christ, in saints coming to him and walking on in
   him, as they have received him: as faith is the eye of the soul, which
   sees Christ, and the hand which receives him, so it is likewise the
   foot which goes to him and walks in him; and nothing is more pleasant
   and delightful to Christ, than for souls to come unto him, and venture
   their all upon him, in expectation of receiving life and salvation,
   righteousness and strength, peace and comfort, grace and glory, all
   from him and through him; for such he willingly receives, and has
   promised never to reject: and as their first coming, so their continued
   walking in him. by fresh repeated acts of faith, is well pleasing to
   him; these feet are beautiful with shoes. Though, 4. By them may be
   meant, the outward conversation of the saints; [821] which is
   frequently expressed in scripture, by walking in the ways, commands and
   ordinances of Christ (see Luke 1:6; Eph. 4:17; Col. 4:5), which may be
   said to be beautiful with shoes, (1.) When they appear to be ready to
   every good work; who, no sooner are enlightened into an ordinance, or
   called to a duty, but they readily comply with it, being beforehand
   furnished and prepared for it, having their shoes upon their feet, in a
   posture of readiness, to do it. (2.) When the conversation is so
   ordered, as that the shame of our nakedness does not appear to the eyes
   of the world: To walk barefoot, was accounted shameful (see Isa. 20:4),
   and so it is to have an ill-ordered conversation: but a well-ordered
   conversation is like shoes to the feet, which cover them, so that the
   shame thereof does not appear. (3.) When it is conformed to God's law;
   which is "a lamp unto the feet, and a light to the path." (4.) When it
   is becoming Christ's gospel. (5.) When it is guarded against the
   reproaches and offenses of the world: as shoes upon the feet keep off
   the thorns and briars from pricking; so does a good conversation,, in
   some measure, keep off the reproaches of the world, or at least keep
   from being disturbed at them; for great peace have they which love
   God's law, and nothing shall offend them: and though it does not afford
   yet a believer, whose conversation is becoming the gospel, may say, as
   Samuel did, chapter 12:3, "Whose ox have I taken? Whose ass have I
   taken? Whom have I defrauded?" so that hereby he is fenced and guarded
   against the world's calumnies and contempt. (6.) Then is it so, when
   there is such a luster in it as cannot but be seen by, and is
   conspicuous to all beholders; which raises their admiration, and gives
   them occasion of glorifying God (see Matthew 5:16), and this, as it is
   commendable among men, so it is beautiful in the eyes of Christ; for so
   such who order their conversations aright, that is, whose feet are
   beautiful with shoes, will he show the salvation of God.

   2dly, "The joints of her thighs" are said to be "as jewels, the work of
   the hands of a cunning workman." By which may be meant, either, 1. Some
   ornaments of gold, silver, or precious stones, which were used to be
   worn about the legs or feet by women in those times; which was a custom
   not only used among the heathens, [822] but also among the Jews, as is
   manifest from Isaiah 3:18, where among the rest of the attire of the
   Jewish women. "The bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their
   feet" is mentioned; and so may be expressive of the greater glory,
   luster, and beauty of the church's conversation. Or, 2. The garments
   which covered the thighs; [823] for it is not agreeable to the rules of
   decency and modesty to describe the naked thighs: the word [824]
   signifies "the compassing of the thighs;" which does not intend the
   ambient flesh, or the thickness of it about them, as R. David Kimchi
   [825] supposes; but rather, the femoralia, or garments about the
   thighs, which encompassed and covered them; by which may be meant, "the
   garments of salvation, and robe of Christ's righteousness," whereby the
   persons of God's elect are covered, so that "the shame of their
   nakedness" does not appear; and with which they are as richly adorned,
   as the bridegroom is with his ornaments, and the bride with her jewels,
   on their marriage-day. Moreover, this is not the bungling work of a
   creature, but "the work of the hands of a cunning workman;" even of one
   that is God as well as man, and therefore is called the righteousness
   of God. Or, 3. The girdle about the loins, according to some, [826]
   which was wont to be worn in those times: thighs being put for loins,
   as in Genesis 46:26 and may intend that girdle of truth with which the
   loins of believers are girt, and is joined with "the preparation of the
   gospel of peace," with which their feet are shod, in Ephesians 6:14,15,
   which metaphor is frequently made use of, when a gospel-con-versation
   is directed and exhorted to (see Luke 12:35; 1 Peter 1:13). Or, 4. By
   these "joints of the thighs," may be meant young converts: The Targum
   expounds it of the children which sprung from the thighs or loins of
   the people of Israel (see Gen. 46:26; Ex. 1:5; Judg. 8:30), where this
   phrase, "to come out of the loins," or, as it is in the Hebrew text,
   "the thighs," is expressive of generation; and therefore these words,
   in a mystical and spiritual sense, may have reference to those many
   souls that are born again in the church; who are as jewels in Christ's
   esteem; and are the curious workmanship of the blessed Spirit, "created
   in Christ Jesus unto good works." Or else, 5. By these "joints or
   turnings of the thighs," [827] by which they move orderly and
   regularly, may be meant the principles of a believer's walk and
   conversation, as one [828] well observes, without which it is little
   worth, nor can it be ordered aright; for principles denominate actions
   to be either good or evil. Now the principles of grace, from whence a
   believer acts in his conversation, and by which he moves in his
   Christian walk, are as valuable and as precious as jewels; and are
   wrought by no less a hand than the Spirit of God, who "worketh in them
   both to will and to do of his good pleasure."

Chapter 7 Verse 2

   Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor:
   thy belly is like an heap of wheat, set about with lilies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word here continues the commendation of his church, and gives two
   other instances of her beauty: and as in the former verse, he had
   commended those parts, which may be expressive of her outward walk and
   conversation, and of the principles of grace from whence she acted; so
   here he may be thought to set forth her inward glory by these, the
   navel and belly, which are more hidden and less conspicuous; for this
   king's daughter is all-glorious within, as well as her conversation is
   honorable without; her adorning not being the "outward adorning, of
   platting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;
   but is the hidden man of the heart, is that which is not corruptible,
   even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of
   God of great price:" but what is particularly intended by these parts,
   will more manifestly appear from a distinct consideration of them. And,

   I.Her navel is said to be "like a round goblet, which wanteth not
   liquor."

   II.Her belly as "an heap of wheat, set about with lilies."

   I.Her navel is compared to "a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor:"
   by which some [829] understand, not that part of the body itself, but
   some covering or ornament of it; as some jewel or plate of gold, which
   was so called, either, because it was the shape of the navel, or else,
   because it covered and adorned it; as also, because the word translated
   round in the Chaldee language signifies the moon, it has inclined them
   to think that this ornament may be the same which the Jewish women are
   said to wear, in Isaiah 3:18, where mention is made of their "round
   tires like the moon;" which figure is also understood by the Targum
   upon our text though others, [830] who are also of opinion that some
   covering of these parts is intended; yet think that the reference is
   made unto that "clothing of wrought gold," with which the church is
   said to be arrayed, in Psalm 45:13 in the midst of which, or in that
   part of it which covered the navel and belly, was a raised or embossed
   work, which resembled an heap of wheat, or rather, sheaves of wheat,
   round about which was an embroidery of curious flowers, and especially
   lilies; ,and in the midst of the whole work, a fountain or conduir,
   running with several sorts of liquors, into a great bowl or bason:
   Fortunatus Scacchus [831] interprets it of a garment covering those
   parts, embroidered with lilies. By all which, the glory and beauty of
   the "garments of salvation, and robe of Christ's righteousness," with
   which believers are adorned, may be represented to us. R. Aben Ezra, by
   the navel, understands the great Sanhedrim; as he does by the belly,
   the lesser: [832] R. Solomon Jarchi, lishcat gazit, or the paved
   chamber an which they sat. Moreover, nothing is more frequent with
   Jewish writers, [833] than to call the land of Canaan, and particularly
   Jerusalem, the navel of the earth; which they suppose to be in the very
   midst of it, for which reason they call it so; and it was from this
   navel of the earth, that the gospel of Christ, went forth into all the
   world; "for out of Zion shall go, forth the law, and the word of the
   Lord from Jerusalem:" The Targum, or Chaldee paraphrase on the place,
   applies it to the "head of the school; by whose righteousness the whole
   world receives nourishment, even as the child receives nourishment
   through its navel in its mother's bowels." And I am inclined to think,
   that by it we are to understand the ministers of the gospel; who, in
   the administration of the word and ordinances, are that to Christ's
   body, the church, as the navel is to an human body: and, 1. As the
   navel is placed in the more eminent part of the belly, so ate the
   ministers of the gospel in the highest place in the church; who, being
   called to the greatest work, have the greatest gifts, and largest
   measures of grace bestowed upon them, to furnish them for it; to whom
   others are exhorted to submit themselves, they being set over them "in
   or by the Lord." 2. As the navel, they are placed in the midst of
   Christ's body, the church: it is in the midst of the church they do all
   their work, preach the gospel, and administer ordinances, in imitation
   of and conformity to their great master and prophet in Israel, Christ
   Jesus; who said, "In the midst of the church will I sing praise unto
   thee," (Heb. 2:12). 3. As the navel is the strength of the intestines;
   so the ministers of Christ are not only strong themselves, in the power
   and grace of Christ, as they had need be, but are also strength-criers
   of others; one principal part of their work being to "strengthen weak
   hands, and confirm the feeble knees;" as our Lord said to Peter, "when
   thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren," (Luke 22:32). 4. As the
   navel conduces much to the health of the body, so do the ministers of
   the gospel to the health of the church: Solomon, speaking of the tear
   of the Lord, says, that "it shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to
   thy bones," where, by the navel, he means the whole body; that being in
   a good plight, and a healthful condition, has much influence upon the
   whole body to make it so: The ministers of Christ, in preaching the
   everlasting gospel, and feeding souls with the "wholesome words of our
   Lord Jesus Christ," are very serviceable for the increasing and
   maintaining the health of the church; many things in the book of
   Proverbs are applicable to them in this case (see Prov. 12:18, 13:17,
   16:24). 5. The navel is that part through which the child receives its
   nourishment in the womb; the ministers of Christ as they are
   instruments in begetting souls again, so they are useful in the
   nourishing of them, even when in embryo, as well as in feeding them
   with " the sincere milk of the word;" which they, as "new-born babes,"
   are desirous of, and with which they are nourished and brought up.
   Moreover, the navel of the church is compared to a "round goblet, bowl
   or bason." I need not observe how aptly the metaphor agrees with this
   part of the body, it being like a bowl or bason, both round and hollow;
   though the mystical writers ,among the Jews render it, the pit of the
   breast or stomach; [834] a phrase which we also use, and rather seems
   to answer better the description given: which, in a mystical sense, may
   be expressive of, 1. The perfection of gospel-ministers: the round or
   circular form is accounted the most per-feet; these, though they are
   not absolutely perfect, yet may be said to be comparatively so, having
   a more perfect knowledge of the gospel, and the mysteries of it, than
   private believers usually have (see Phil. 3:15), for having a larger
   acquaintance with the scriptures of truth, they are thereby in a sense
   made perfect, and "thoroughly furnished Unto all good works," as the
   apostle observes, in 2 Timothy 3:17, 2. It may also be expressive of
   that workmanship which is bestowed upon them; who of themselves are not
   "sufficient for these things," until, by the gifts and graces of the
   Spirit, they are made "able ministers of the New Testament," and in
   some good measure qualified for the work of the ministry; and then are
   they like "a round goblet," turned and formed by some curious artist.
   3. It may likewise serve to set forth the capacity which they are
   endowed withal, to hold and retain gospel-truths; they are not like
   colanders, which immediately let out whatever is poured into them; but
   like round goblets, bowls or basons, which to old and retain whatever
   they receive; and this is esteemed as a necessary qualification of a
   gospel minister, by the apostle Paul, in Titus 1:9, that he be such an
   one as holds fast the faithful word, and does not let it slip nor go
   from him; but continues in the things which he has learned, knowing of
   whom he has learned them.

   Also, it is worthy of our notice, that this navel of the church is not
   compared to an empty goblet, but to one that "wanteth not liquor:" by
   which may be meant, (1.) The grace of the blessed Spirit which is more
   or less in all believers; which lunch conduces to their healthfulness,
   as the moisture of the navel does to the body: it is no unusual thing
   in scripture for the grace of the Spirit to be compared to water, and
   to an abundance of it; even to rivers of living water; which are said
   to be in the belly of a believer, and these are never-failing ones; for
   grace is in them, as a "well of water springing up into everlasting
   life." Or, (2.) The church's cleanness may be intended by this
   expression; who being washed in Christ's blood, and sprinkled with the
   clean water of the everlasting covenant, needed no other liquor to be
   washed with; and thus, as a navel not cut and unwashed, represents the
   impurity and corruption of nature, in Ezekiel 16:4, so a navel cut and
   washed, as the church's is here, may be expressive of her purity and
   cleanness, through the blood and grace of Christ; so that she needs no
   other liquor to make her clean. Or rather, (3.) It intends those large
   and never-failing supplies which the ministers of the gospel
   continually have from Christ; who is "ascended on high to fill all
   things," and particularly ministers; that so they may never want the
   liquor of gospel-truths to communicate to others; for which reason he
   has promised to be with them unto the end of the world; as he
   accordingly is, and continues filling these golden pipes, as fast as
   they empty the golden oil of gospel-truths out of themselves. And, 4.
   The Hebrew word translated liquor, properly signifying, a mixture, or a
   mixed liquor, [835] may be expressive of that variety of gospel-grace
   and gospel-truths, which they are possessed of, and distribute to
   others: which is a mixture, not of human inventions, and the doctrines
   of the gospel together: but of wine and milk, which are joined
   together, in Isaiah 55:1 to which souls are invited to partake of: and
   which perhaps is the mingled wine, in Proverbs 9:2-5, such a mixed
   liquor [836] being what was drank in those countries, as appears from
   Song of Solomon 5:1, and such a mixture as this, for thirsty,
   distressed and fainting souls, will never be wanting in the gospel, or
   with gospel-ministers.

   Likewise it may be observed, that the words may be read as a wish for a
   continued supply of this mixed liquor in this vessel, thus, "Let there
   not want liquor"; [837] and so is expressive of Christ's strong
   affection to his church, and tender concern that there might be a
   continued supply in the ministry of the word for her nourishment; as
   well as implies a promise that it should be so.

   II.Her belly is said to be as "an heap of wheat, set about with
   lilies;" which, as the former expression sets forth the nourishment
   which she has through the ministry of the word, this may be expressive
   of her fruitfulness thereby: it was usual with the Jews to scatter
   wheat on the heads of married persons, at their weddings, three times,
   saying Increase and multiply; [838] for the allusion seems to be to a
   woman with child, as one [839] welt observes; she is fruitful and big,
   not with wind, but with wheat: by which may be meant, either, 1. The
   word or gospel of the grace of God, which is comparable to wheat; "he
   that hath my word," saith the Lord (Jer. 23:28), "let him speak my word
   faithfully; for what is the chaff to the wheat?" there is as much
   difference between a teller of dreams, and a faithful preacher of the
   gospel; or between the dreams which the one tells, and the word which
   the other preaches, as there is between the chaff and the wheat. The
   gospel may be compared to wheat for the excellency of it: wheat is the
   most excellent of grain; it is not only preferable to chaff, but to all
   other gram whatsoever: so the gospel is preferable to all other
   doctrines whatever; and ought to be valued by believers mote than their
   necessary food seeing that those who are fed therewith, are fed with
   the "finest of the wheat;" and therefore may not only be compared to
   wheat for its excellency, but also for the nourishment which it
   conveys. Besides, wheat is a solid, weighty, and substantial gram; as
   are also the doctrines of the gospel; which are not like wind, but
   wheat; and is a quite different food than what Ephraim fed upon; of
   whom it is said (Hosea 12:1), "Ephraim feedeth on wind." Moreover, this
   is an heap of wheat, which the church's belly is compared to here; such
   an one as is upon the corn-floor, ready threshed and winnowed, and
   cleared of the chaff (see Ruth 3:7), and so may intend the purity of
   the gospel, and its being clear of all human inventions and mixtures;
   it is wheat that is clear from, and not mixed with the chaff; for as
   faithful ministers will not set forth such to feed upon, so neither
   will enlightened and experienced souls receive it: also, this heap may
   be expressive of the variety and multitude of soul-comforting
   doctrines, and exceeding great and precious promises, with which the
   gospel abounds; there are many of them, an heap of them. and fullness
   of the blessing in every one; they are full of spiritual blessings and
   consolations, especially when they come "in power and in the Holy
   Ghost." Or else, 2. By it may be meant the graces of the Spirit of God,
   with which she was filled; which may also be compared to wheat for the
   excellency of them, being more valuable than, and to be preferred unto
   all the desirable things of nature; and to an "heap of wheat" for the
   variety of them, which souls receive from Christ; of whose "fullness
   they receive grace for grace," that is, grace in some measure
   answerable to the grace in Christ, or grace in abundance; "grace for
   grace," [840] that is, heaps of grace; for there cannot be one grace,
   but there must be every grace, even heaps of grace: as also for the
   purity of them, being free from all mixtures of hypocrisy; their faith
   is a faith unfeigned; their hope, which is fixed on Christ's person,
   blood, and righteousness, is of a different nature than that of the
   hypocrites; their love to God, Christ, his gospel, ordinances and
   people, is without dissimulation; in short, sincerity runs through all
   their graces; they are like an heap of wheat, winnowed and cleared of
   chaff: moreover, these may be compared to wheat for their permanence;
   they will abide the sieve of Satan's temptations, as Peter's faith did;
   for though it was shaken much, it did not fail, because Christ prayed
   for it; and they will also abide the world's fan of persecution, and
   likewise the awful scrutiny and discrimination, which will be made at
   the clay of judgment; when the florid profession and external works and
   righteousness of others will be as chaff, which "the wind shall carry
   away, and vanity shall take," these will abide and appear in their
   greatest glory and full perfection. Though I rather think, 3. That by
   this heap of wheat, to which the church's belly is compared, are meant
   young converts; [841] who are not only born in the church, but are also
   brought forth by her; "for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth
   hot children:" and these are the wheat which Christ will gather into
   his garner, when he will burn up the wicked, "the chaff, with
   unquenchable fire:" as wheat is the noblest of seeds, is full of meat,
   is solid and substantial, these are born, "not of corruptible, but
   incorruptible seed," and being full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and
   continually receiving from Christ's fullness, are solid and substantial
   believers; and will abide the force of persecution now, and stand the
   trying and discriminating time hereafter; "when the ungodly shall not
   be so, but shall be like the chaff which the wind driveth away; for
   they shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation
   of the righteous;" but even then this wheat ,a ill continue on the
   floor, and be gathered into Christ's barn. Moreover, this heap of wheat
   signifies the large number of souls that shall be born again in the
   church; and when those scriptures, in Isaiah 49:19-21 and 60:8, have
   had their full accomplishment, then will this description of the church
   be exactly answered, and appear very glorious.

   Moreover this heap of wheat is said to be "set about with lilies," or,
   as in the Hebrew text, hedged with lilies; [842] which would incline
   one to think, that not an heap of wheat upon the corn-floor, but a
   field of standing wheat is here intended; whose enclosure is not an
   hedge of thorns and briars, but of lilies: by which lilies may be
   meant, either the precious promises and comfortable doctrines which
   abound in, and encompass around the word of God, or else, the sweet
   odor which the graces of the Spirit emit on every side; or rather, "the
   beauties of holiness," in which men appear as soon as they are born
   again; and may be expressive of their secrecy and security, as well as
   of their beauty and glory.

   There is one thing more which I would not omit the mention of., and
   that is, that some interpreters [843] think, that by these two parts,
   the navel and belly, here described, are meant the two ordinances of
   baptism and the Lord's supper: by the former, the ordinance of baptism,
   which is the first ordinance administered to believers; and which none
   but those who are born again, receive any comfort, nourishment or
   benefit from: and by the latter, the Lord's supper; which, like an heap
   of wheat, affords solid and substantial food to believers; where
   Christ, who is the bread of life, whose flesh and blood are meat and
   drink indeed, is set forth to them; who are kindly invited, and are
   heartily welcome to his table; which table of his is graced and
   adorned, or at least should be, not with the weed; or thorns and briars
   of scandalous and profane sinners, who eat: and drink unworthily; but
   with the lilies of precious saints and true believers, who sit as
   olive-plants, or rather are set as lilies about it. Though I should
   rather think, that these are intended in the following verse.

Chapter 7 Verse 3

   Thy two breasts are like two young roes, that are twins.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word breasts are the fifth part, which is here commended by
   Christ; what is intended by them, has been shown in chapter 4:5, where
   we have met with the same commendation, and that in the same words;
   only here is an omission of a clause which is added there, namely,
   "which feed among the lilies." The Targum here again makes mention of
   the two Messiahs, whom the Jews vainly expect: R. Aben Ezra expounds
   those words of their two laws, oral and written, as he had done in the
   chapter and place above-mentioned: as R. Solomon Jarchi does also of
   the two tables of the law; though he likewise produces another sense of
   the words, which is, that by the two breasts are meant the king and the
   high priest: but for the understanding of the words, the reader is
   referred to chapter 4:5, where they are more largely insisted on.

Chapter 7 Verse 4

   Thy neck is as a tower of ivory: thine eyes like the fish-pools in
   Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower Ode
   Lebanon, which looketh toward Damascus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word continues his commendation of the church's beauty; and adds,
   in these words, three other instance, of it to the five former,
   mentioned in the preceding verses. And,

   I.He compares her neck to "a tower of ivory."

   II."Her eyes to the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim."

   III."Her nose to the tower of Lebanon, which looketh toward Damascus."

   I. He compares her neck to a tower of ivory: Two things recommend the
   neck, erectness and whiteness; both are here expressed, the one by a
   tower, the other by ivory; hence a fine beautiful neck is called an
   ivory one; [844] and for the same reason it sometimes has the epithet
   of snowy, [845] and sometimes of milky, [846] and sometimes of marble.
   [847] R. Aben Ezra, by the neck, understands the King Messiah; but he
   is not the neck, but the head of the church; R. Solomon Jarchi
   interprets it of the temple and altar, or of the lishcat gazit, or
   paved chamber, in which the Sanhedrim sat: The Targum would have abbeth
   din, the father of the house of judgment, or chief of the Sanhedrim,
   intended: but it seems better by it to understand, either,

   1st, The ministers of the gospel, who hold unto, bear up and exalt
   Christ, the head; and are instruments in bringing souls near unto him,
   and of conveying spiritual food to the several members of his body, the
   church: who are likewise beautifully adorned with the gifts and graces
   of the Spirit, whereby they are fitted for the work they are called
   unto: these may also be said to be like towers for their strength and
   impregnableness; they are set for the defense of the gospel, and are as
   immoveable as towers; they stand the battery of Satan's rage and
   malice, and abide the force of the world's persecutions and reproaches;
   and none of these things move them to desert the work they are employed
   in. Moreover, this neck of the church is compared to a tower of ivory:
   whether there was a tower built of ivory, or that was so called, we
   have no account in scripture; the Targum, on this place, speaks of an
   ivory tower, which king Solomon made, but the scripture is entirely
   silent about it; unless by it we understand that great throne of ivory,
   which is mentioned in 2 Kings 10:18, and which may as well be cared a
   tower, as the pulpit on which Ezra and others stood, is, in the Hebrew
   text, in Nehemiah 8:4. Now the church's neck may be said to be as a
   tower of ivory, 1. To express the purity of gospel ministers, both in
   doctrine and life; who at once answer that character, of holding the
   mystery of the faith in a pure conscience; and so become examples to
   others, both in faith and purity. 2. These may be said to be as towers
   of ivory for their strength which they receive from Christ, to hold
   fast the doctrine of faith, to confirm and establish others in it, and
   to withstand the force and power of Satan's temptations. 3. They may be
   compared hereunto, for the smoothness and evenness of those doctrines
   which they preach; by which I mean, not those smooth things, which
   carnal persons would have prophesied to them, such as are tickling to
   the carnal ear, taking to the carnal fancy, and suited to the carnal
   hearts of unconverted ones; but such as are agreeable to the word of
   God, consistent with themselves, being all of a piece, and not yea and
   nay, as well as suited to the experiences of God's children. Or else,

   2dly, By the church's neck may be meant, the scriptures of truth; which
   lead and direct souls to Christ, the head; and are the means of
   conveying spiritual breath, life, and food to God's children; and are
   beautifully hung and adorned with soul-refreshing doctrines, and
   comfortable promises. Now this neck may be said to be as a tower which
   is very high: seeing that it contains things which are sublime, and out
   of the reach of carnal sense and reason; and is also as impregnable and
   immoveable as a tower; for though Satan and his emissaries have
   attempted to remove the scriptures out of the world; yet their efforts
   have hitherto, and ever will be in vain: and these may likewise be very
   well compared to a tower of ivory, for the purity and glory of them;
   for, "the words of the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a
   furnace of earth, purified seven times," (Ps. 12:6). Or else,

   3dly, By the church's neck may be meant, the grace of faith, which lays
   hold upon and keeps close to Christ, the head; it is that grace which
   exalts and glorifies him, and by which saints live upon him, and
   receive grace, strength and nourishment from him; and is never without
   the other graces of the Spirit, and the becoming fruits of
   righteousness, which serve to adorn it: This may be compared to a tower
   of ivory, 1. For the strength of it; which appears both in believing
   the promises of God, which sometimes seem to be attended with
   difficulties insuperable to sense and reason, and in resisting and
   withstanding Satan's temptations; this fort and tower of faith Satan
   could never take and demolish it: it has stood, and will stand against
   all the posse that he is able to collect together against it; because
   Christ, who is the author, will be the finisher of it; and continually
   prays that it fail not. 2. For the purity, beauty and glory of it; as
   the church's neck being compared to a tower, is expressive of its
   strength. So its being compared to ivory, shows its beauty and
   fairness: faith, that is pure and unfeigned, is a beautiful grace in
   the eyes of Christ; he is sometimes ravished with this neck of the
   church, and with one chain thereof: see chapter 4:9. 3. For the
   preciousness of it; as ivory is very precious and valuable, so is this
   grace of faith; it is called precious faith, in 2 Peter 1:1, and so it
   is in its nature, object, and actings; it is more precious than ivory,
   yea, than gold; hence the trial of it is said to be "much more precious
   than that of gold that perisheth," (1 Peter 1:7).

   II.The eyes of the church are here compared to fish-pools: in Heshbon,
   by the gate of Bathrabbim: in this comparison the allusion may be to
   the humors in the eye, one of which is called aquea; which are enclosed
   as water in a fishpool, and in which the eye seems to swim; hence the
   eyes are called by Virgil [848] natantia lamina; and the same word in
   Hebrew, signifies both a fountain and the eye; and fishpools, in the
   plural number, are properly observed, because there are two eyes. Some
   think that Heshbon is not to be taken here as the proper name of a
   place, but to be read in construction with fishpools, thus, thine eyes
   are like to fishpools, artificially made; [849] that are curiously
   formed, and according to art; such as were about the sheep-gate, which
   is here called the gate of Bathrabbim, because it was much frequented,
   and through it abundance of people passed to and fro: but it seems most
   agreeable to understand it of the city Heshbon, which. was the seat of
   Sihon king of the Amorites, as appears from Numbers 21:26, and
   Bathrabbim was one of the gates of this city; which was so called,
   either because it led to Rabbath, a city near unto it, and therefore
   are mentioned together, in Jeremiah 49:3, which,, as is manifest from 2
   Samuel 12:27, was a city of waters: or else, because of the vast
   multitudes of people which went in and out thereat; for it may be
   rendered: "the gate of the daughter of many, or of great ones." Near
   this gate, it seems, were some very excellent and delightful fishpools,
   to which the eyes of the church are here compared; and by which may be
   meant, either,

   1st, The ministers of the gospel; [850] who are to the church, as eyes
   are to the body; for which see chapter 1:15, and these may be compared
   to fishpools, 1. For their clearness of sight into gospel-truths: it is
   true, in comparison of that light and knowledge which saints have in
   glory, they now "see but through a glass darkly;" but yet, with respect
   to the legal dispensation, in which there was much darkness and
   obscurity, they may be said to "behold with open face the glory of the
   Lord;" and their light will still be considerably increased, when the
   "watchmen shall see eye to eye;" and that will be, "when the Lord shall
   bring again Zion." 2. Like fishpools full of water, they are filled
   with "the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ:" the means
   of grace, the ordinances of the gospel, and particularly the ministry
   of the word, are in scripture compared to waters (see Isa. 55:1), where
   souls are kindly invited, and where they often meet with that which is
   as refreshing as cold water to a thirsty man; and of this Christ's
   ministers are full, being filled by him, who "fills all things;" they
   are not like those, in 2 Peter 2:17, who are said to be "wells without
   water," but are like "the fishpools in Heshbon," clear and full. 3.
   They may be compared to those fishpools which were "by the gate of
   Bathrabbim," because of the multitude of people which flock to, and
   attend upon their ministry, and which receive benefit more or less
   thereby; and then more especially will they answer this metaphor, when
   that prophecy, in Isaiah 2:2,3, shall have its full accomplishment. 4.
   The word which is here translated fishpools, comes from a word which
   signifies to bless, because pools of water were esteemed blessings (see
   Judg. 1:15), and so are ministers of the gospel to the churches of
   Christ; they are promised by God as such (Jer. 3:15), and he sometimes
   threatens to remove them as such from his churches, when they are grown
   carnal, lukewarm and indifferent, and do not prize and use such mercies
   and blessings as they should (see Rev. 2:5). Lord's days, ordinances,
   and opportunities of hearing the gospel preached, are the only
   blessings and comforts of life that some enjoy; God gives them "the
   bread of adversity, and the water of affliction;" this they are sure to
   have, with this they are fed all the week long; but on Lord's-days,
   they have sweet and comfortable meals for their souls; and this great
   blessing God favors them with, though he denies them many temporal
   ones, which is, that their teachers are not removed into corners, but
   their eyes behold their teachers; they have Christ's fishpools to come
   unto. 5. They are like fishpools, whose waters are still, quiet,
   invariable and constant; and are not like troubled waters, such as
   false teachers are, who are continually casting up the mire and dirt of
   their own inventions, and the divers and strange doctrines of men; but
   these abound with those truths, which, like Christ, the author of them,
   are "the same yesterday, today, and for ever." Or else,

   2dly, By these eyes of the church, may be meant "the eyes of her
   understanding," which are enlightened by the Spirit of God,
   particularly those of faith and knowledge; which may be said to be as
   fishpools, 1. For their perspicuity: faith can behold things clearly,
   which are invisible to, and are out of the reach of carnal sense and
   reason, and therefore is called "the evidence of things not seen;" it
   can look "within the veil," and view an unseen Christ, with all the
   invisible realities of another world. 2. For their steadiness and
   unmoveableness: the eye of faith is fixed, not upon the duties,
   services and performances of the creature; but upon the person, blood
   and righteousness of Christ; it looks off of all things else alone to
   him. 3. For their abounding with the tears of gospel-repentance: Jeremy
   wished that his "head were waters," and his "eyes a fountain of tears:"
   the believers eyes are so; for repentance is a tear that drops from
   faith's eye: souls first look, and then they mourn; nor do they ever
   more so, nor in a better manner, than when they can view their
   righteousness, peace, and pardon in a bleeding Savior; it is under a
   sense of this, they both mourn, most and best, both for their own sins,
   and the sins of others; their eyes are as fishpools, abounding with
   these waters; "rivers of water run down their eyes, because they keep
   not God's law," (Ps. 119:136). 4. For the modesty of them: these are
   not rolling waters, to which wanton and immodest eyes may be compared;
   but quiet, still and standing ones: faith is a very modest grace; and
   he that is possessed of it, and has the greatest measure thereof, is
   the most humble soul; it exalts Christ, magnifies his grace, and gives
   all the glory to him; it abases the creature, takes away all boasting
   from him, and ascribes nothing to him; for which reason the church's
   eyes are also said to be as "doves eyes within her locks." 5. For their
   proportionable size, exact symmetry, and delightful beauty: perhaps the
   allusion may be to fishpools; [851] which, being discerned at some
   distances between trees or groves, look very sparkling and dazzling;
   and so did the church's eyes to Christ; with which he seems to be
   ravished, as he says he was, in chapter 4:9 and 6:5.

   III.Her nose is said to be "as the tower of Lebanon, which looketh
   toward Damascus:" Very properly is the nose mentioned next to the eyes;
   since, as Cicero [852] says, it is so placed, as that it seems to be as
   a wall between the eyes; and here it is compared to a tower, not for
   the largeness of it, which is not reckoned comely, but for its position
   and use: though it may be rendered, "thy face;" [853] and may denote
   her aspect, bold and courageous. This tower of Lebanon seems to be one
   that was built in or near the forest of Lebanon; and was a frontier
   tower for that part of the country which lay towards Damascus: it was a
   tower on that part of mount Lebanon which fronted Damascus, that lay in
   a valley; and so open to view, as well as exposed to winds, hence
   called by Lucan, [854] ventosa Damascus; which tower was so high, as
   Adrichomius [855] says, that from thence might be seen and numbered the
   houses in Damascus: Vitringa [856] observes, that many travelers relate
   that, on the extreme part of this mountain, in a craggy place, to which
   the plain of Damascus is subject, is a small building; which, though it
   is of an Arabic original, as is said, yet he thinks it is the place
   where a tower formerly was, looking to Damascus, to which Solomon here
   alludes. To this the church's nose is compared: by which may be meant,
   1. either, 1. The ministers of Christ, as before; for it need not be
   thought strange, that one and the same thing should be expressed by
   different metaphors for different reasons, especially this: seeing
   there are different parts and branches of the work and office of
   ministers; who are not only eyes to see, but as the nose to smell;
   having a spiritual discerning into gospel-truths beyond others, they
   not only savor them themselves, but diffuse the savor of them to
   others, and are themselves to many "the savor of life unto life:" they
   are, in some measure; both the ornament and the defense of the church;
   the former is intended by their being compared to the nose, which is
   the ornament of the face, as well as the seat of smelling; and the
   latter, by "the tower of Lebanon;" and this as "looking towards
   Damascus," the inhabitants of which were always enemies to the people
   of Israel: and so it denotes the courage and vigilance of faithful
   ministers; who continually have their eye upon the church's enemies,
   watch all their motions, observe all their steps, and, wish a manful
   courage, face and attack them. Or, 2. By this part thus described, may
   be intended in general, the stateliness and majesty, courage and
   magnanimity of the church; her stateliness and majesty by her nose,
   which, when of a good size and well-proportioned, adds much grace and
   majesty to the countenance; her magnanimity and courage, by its being
   compared to the invincible and impregnable tower of Lebanon, which
   looks towards Damascus; intimating, that she was not afraid to look her
   worst enemies in the face; and so answers the character which is given
   of her, both by Christ and by the daughters, in chapter 6:4,10, which
   is, that she was "terrible as an army with banners." Or else, 3. It is
   expressive of her prudence and discretion in spiritual things which she
   is capable of discerning from carnal; she can distinguish truth from
   error, and can espy dangers afar off, and so guard against them; for
   which her nose may be compared to this tower which was thus situated.

Chapter 7 Verse 5a

   FORMER PART.

   Thine head upon thee is like Carmel,
   and the hair of thine head like purple--
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words contain the two last, which are the ninth and tenth
   instances of the church's beauty.

   I.Her head upon her is said to be like Carmel.

   II.The hair of her head like purple.

   I.Her head is compared to Carmel. And it will be proper to inquire,
   First, What is the church's head. Secondly, Why it is thus compared.

   First, I shall inquire what the church's head is; which is not the
   civil magistrate; he may indeed be a member of the church, but not the
   head of it: The princes and great men of the world may be of much
   service to the church; as in the latter day, kings shall be her nursing
   fathers, and queens her nursing mothers; but then they shall be so far
   from being her head, that they shall bow down unto tier, and lick up
   the dust of her feet: The Targum indeed understands it of the king who
   is set over the people.

   Some [857] think, that by the head, is meant the soul or mind; which is
   indeed the chief part in man; and being filled with the graces of the
   Spirit, and the precious fruits of righteousness, may much resemble the
   top of Carmel, covered with pleasant plants and fruitful trees: but it
   seems better to understand it of Christ, who only is the head of the
   church; she is compared to a body, because consisting of various
   members, of which body he is the head; see Colossians 1:18. "And he is
   the head of the body, the church." Christ is,

   1st, A representative head of his church; as such he acted in the
   everlasting covenant of grace; where what he did he did in her name,
   and what he received he received for her; hence the elect are said to
   be blessed with all spiritual blessings, and grace is said to be given
   to them in him before the foundation of the world: thus also he acted
   as their representative, when he was crucified, buried, rose again, and
   entered into heaven; they were then crucified, buried and raised, and
   are now made to sit together in heavenly places in him.

   2dly, He is a political head; in the same sense as a king is the head
   of his people, Christ is the head of his church; and this regards his
   kingly office, as the other did his suretyship engagements: Christ is
   given to be "an head over all things to the church;" and he is head
   over the church, thine head, dyl[ which is over thee and above thee;
   and which may be understood in the same sense, and may be interpreted
   by his Father's setting him as king over his holy hill of Zion.; which
   office he execrates, by enacting laws for the good of his people, which
   are written, not upon tables of stone, but upon "the fleshly tables of
   the heart;" by subduing their enemies, protecting their persons, and
   supplying them with all necessaries, as an head and common parent to
   them.

   3dly, He is an economical head: He is an head to his church, in the
   same sense as an husband is to his wife (Eph. 5:23), she being espoused
   and married to him, ought to be subject to him, as her head; and in the
   same sense as a father is to his children. Christ is the everlasting
   Father saints are his children, which God has given him, and are born
   unto him in his church; and him they ought to honor, as their head.
   Also he is so in the same sense as a master is to his servants; and it
   is under this consideration that Christ becomes the head of angels, who
   are servants in his family: he is not indeed the redeemer of angels,
   because they never were in a state of slavery and captivity; nor is he
   the mediator of them, they.having never been at variance with God, nor
   rebelled against him; but yet he is the head of them, according to
   Colossians 2:10, "which is the head of all principality and power."

   4thly, He is a natural head; even as an human head is to an human body;
   and it is in allusion to this that he is often called the head; of
   which many things may be said: as, 1. That he is a true and proper
   head; and that which is so, must, (1.) Be of the same nature with the
   body; so is Christ; he has partaken of the same flesh and blood, and
   has been in all things made like unto his church, sin excepted; hence
   arise that strong affection to her, sympathy with her, and care of her.
   (2.) It must be united to it; an head separate from the body, cannot be
   a proper head, nor do the service of one to the body; there is a
   spiritual and indissoluble union between Christ and his church; which
   is represented by that conjugal union there is between a man and his
   wife, by which, they become one flesh; and also by that natural one, of
   the vine and branches; but nothing does more express it to the life,
   than that of head and members; for "we are members of his body, of his
   flesh, and of his bones." (3.) It must be superior to the body, as well
   as of the same nature with it, and united to it: so is Christ: and that
   not only in his highest nature, as he is God, and in his office, grace
   and power: but even in our nature, being "crowned with honor and
   glory," and set at his Father's right-hand in it, "far above all
   principality and power." (4.) It must be a living head, and endued with
   the same vital spirit as the body is: such an one is Christ: he and his
   church live one and the same life: he is the believer's life: he lives,
   but it is Christ that lives in him: one and the same vital spirit
   actuates both head and members, and that is the Spirit of God, which is
   in Christ, the head, without measure, but in his members in measure;
   "for he that is joined to the Lord, is one spirit." 2. Christ is a
   perfect head; there is no deficiency in him, nor any thing wanting that
   may render him a suitable one to his church. (1.) Here are no part nor
   sense wanting; he has eyes to see with, which are continually fixed
   upon his people; he sees their persons and their circumstances, and
   accordingly relieves them; his cars are open to their cries, which are
   not disregarded by him; and he has a tongue to speak a word in season,
   both to them and for them; he smells a sweet savor in the persons,
   garments and graces of his people, and has tasted death for them all.
   (2.) Here are no vicious humors which fall from hence to infect the
   body: Adam was a federal head to all his seed; but nothing is derived
   from him but sin, corruption, and death, and such vicious humors, which
   have infected all human nature; but from Christ is nothing derived, but
   holiness, grace and life; for he himself is "holy, harmless, and
   undefiled." (3.) Here is no deformity at all; but every part is in its
   proper place and just proportion; there is a surpassing beauty in all:
   "he is fairer than the children of men;" there is none to be compared
   to him; "he is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand." (4.)
   Here is a fullness of every thing to supply his body with; "he is full
   of grace and truth:" there is a fullness of justifying and sanctifying
   grace in him; all our righteousness, holiness, grace, strength, life
   and nourishment, come from Christ, our head; "it is in him we live, and
   move, and have our being;" and he has a sufficiency of all grace to
   supply his members with. 3. Christ is the only head of his church;
   there is no other; if the church had more heads than one, she would be
   a monster: The civil magistrate is no head of the church; neither lathe
   pope of Rome; Christ only is. As there is but one body, though
   consisting of various members; and one spirit, which actuates them all;
   and one faith, by which they hold to the head; and one baptism, in
   which they make a profession of him; and one God and father of us all,
   who, by adopting grace, has made and owned them for his children; so
   there is but one Lord and head unto them, "who is over all, God blessed
   for ever." 4. He is an everlasting head: The church never was, nor
   never will be without an head; she has a living one, and one that lives
   for ever; and this is matter of joy and consolation to God's people;
   hence they need not fear a suitable supply of all grace, life and
   strength; for, because he lives as their head, they, his members, shall
   live also. But,

   Secondly, I shall now consider why Christ, who is the church's head, is
   compared to Carmel; that is, mount Carmel, as the Arabic version
   expressly renders it. And, 1. This was a mountain in the land of Judea,
   where Elijah contended with and slew the prophets of Baal; and which
   the Targum on this text takes notice of: and for the height of it,
   Christ, the church's head, may be compared unto it; "who is higher than
   the kings of the earth," nay, than the angels in heaven; for he is "set
   far above all prinicipality and power;" nay, he is "higher than the
   heavens themselves." 2. This was a very fruitful mountain; whose top
   was covered with vines, com-fields, and fruitful trees (see Isa. 35:2;
   Amos 1:2). The word is sometimes used for green ears of corn, as in
   Leviticus 2:14 and 23:14 and is sometimes rendered, by our Translators,
   a fruitful field, as in Isaiah 32:15. A bushy, well-set head of hair,
   which may be here referred to, since hair is mentioned in the next
   clause, may be fitly compared to a mountain or to a field, covered with
   trees and grass, and such to an head of hair: [858] and this may be
   expressive of Christ, the church's head, on whom her hair grows; and
   who is her green fir-tree, from whom all her fruit is found. 3. The
   word by some, [859] rendered crimson; and the rather; it may seem to be
   so taken here, because purple is made use of in the next description;
   and which go together, and are thus rendered, in 2 Chronicles 2:7 and
   3:14, And this may serve to set forth, (1.) The royal dignity and
   majesty of Christ; this being a color usually worn by the kings and
   great men of the earth; tree of Christ's titles, is "the Prince of the
   kings of the earth," (Rev. 1:5). (2.) His ardent love to his church;
   whose flaming affection to her may be very well represented by this
   color. Or, (3.) His passion and bloody suffering for his church and
   people; by which their sins, though like scarlet, become as snow; and
   though red like crimson, are as wool: so that here is a crimson Savior
   for crimson sinners. Thus may Christ, the church's head, be compared to
   Carmel.

   Though some think, that not the head, but some covering of the head, is
   intended here: R. Solomon Jarchi thinks, that the tephillin or
   phylacteries, which the Jews wore about their heads, are here meant;
   but this is not probable: rather, with others, [860] the allusion is to
   the nuptial crown or garland, made of flowers, etc., which was wore by
   the bride on the marriage-day: and this may denote the graces of the
   blessed Spirit, which are "an ornament of grace to the head, and chains
   about the neck;" which may very well be thought to resemble the
   fruitful top of mount Carmel: and as one [861] well observes, by this
   covering of the head, more particularly may be meant, the grace of
   hope, which is the believer's head-piece (1 Thess. 5:8), as Christ, who
   is our head, is called our hope; so our hope, which is our head-piece,
   by a figure which is not unusual, may be called the head; it is
   supported and sustained by faith, which is the neck; and has its life
   and liveliness from the death, sufferings and resurrection of Christ;
   and therefore may be compared to crimson.

   II.The hair of her head is said to be like purple: purple-colored hair
   was in great esteem; of this color was the hair of king Nysus,
   according to the fable; [862] and so the hair of Evadne and of the
   muses were of a violet color; [863] the hair of Ulysses is said to be
   like to the hyacinth flower, [864] which is of a purple or violet
   color; and Milton [865] calls the first Adam's hair, hyacinthine locks;
   and here in a figurative sense, the second Adam's hair is said to be
   like purple. By which may be meant, either the thoughts of her heart,
   which are many and numerous, and which proceed from thence; as the hair
   does from the head; and when these are fixed upon, and are employed in
   the contemplation of a crucified Christ, then may they be said to be
   like purple; and then are they taken notice of by Christ, and are
   exceeding delightful to him. Though I rather think, that believers are
   here meant, as I have observed on chapter 4:1 and 5:11, who grow on
   Christ, the head, and receive their strength and nourishment from him;
   and these may be said to be like purple, 1. Because of that royal and
   princely dignity they axe advanced to by Christ; who has made them
   "kings and priests to God and his father;" for this is a color that is
   usually worn by great personages, [866] such as all believers are. 2.
   Because of their being washed in Christ's purple blood; for so are both
   their persons and their garments; they are tinctured with it, and are
   of this dye. 3. Because of the sufferings which they undergo for the
   sake of Christ and his gospel; and especially such dear and precious
   servants of Christ may be said to be as purple, who have spilled their
   blood, and laid down their lives on his account.

   Though some [867] think, that not the hair, but either the hair-lace,
   or the pins, or some such small things, by which the hair is tied and
   dressed up in a beautiful order, are intended; and indeed the word is
   never used elsewhere for hair, and it properly signifies something
   small, thin and tender: and this may teach us what notice Christ takes
   of the meanest grace and performance of believers; every little thing
   that is in, or is done by a believer, looks very beautiful in Christ's
   eye; so far is he from despising the day of small things.

Chapter 7 Verse 5b & 6

   VERSE 5.

   LATTER PART

   --The king is held in the galleries.

   VERSE 6.

   How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights?
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word , having given a description of the church's beauty, in ten
   particular instances of it, does here,

   I.In the latter part of the fifth verse, discover his great love and
   affection to her, though in a very abrupt manner; "the king is held in
   the galleries."

   II.Gives a general and comprehensive summary of her whole beauty, in
   verse 6 thus; "How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for
   delights." And,

   I.I shall consider this abrupt expression, "the king is held in the
   galleries:" which seems to have no dependence upon or connection with,
   either the preceding or subsequent words, but only with the affections
   of Christ's heart; who being as it were surprised and astonished at,
   captivated and ravished with the church's beauty, breaks out in these
   words, even before he had well finished the account he was giving. And
   it may be here inquired, 1st, Who is meant by the king. 2dly, What
   those galleries are in which he is said to be held. And, 3dly, What by
   being held in them.

   1st, By the king, we are to understand the Messiah, the Lord Jesus
   Christ; who is the governor of the whole universe, has a sovereign
   dominion over all creatures, is the prince of the kings of the earth;
   who sets up and pulls down at pleasure, and exercises an uncontrollable
   power over all created beings: and who is in an especial manner the
   king of saints; who are committed to him as mediator by his Father, to
   rule and govern; whom he has purchased by his own blood, and conquered
   by the mighty power of his grace; in whose hearts he reigns, by putting
   his Spirit, implanting his grace, and writing his laws there; whom he
   continually protects, subdues their enemies, and supplies with all
   things necessary: this kingdom of his is not of this world; it is not
   supported by worldly power; nor carried on with worldly interest; nor
   does it appear in worldly pomp and splendor; but is of an invisible
   find spiritual nature; it is managed according to the strictest rules
   of justice and equity, and is upon such a foundation as will last for
   ever.

   2dly, By the galleries, in which this great king is held, we are to
   understand the ordinances of the. gospel: the same word, which is here
   rendered galleries, is, in chapter 1:17 translated rafters; which are
   of much use for the strength and support of buildings: as the
   ordinances are for the strengthening of weak hands, and confirming of
   feeble knees: the word is also by some, here rendered canals, [868] as
   it is gutters, in Genesis 30:38, 41. And troughs to water cattle in
   Exodus 2:16 which also is applicable to the ordinances of the gospel
   through which, as through so many canals, conduit-pipes or gutters, is
   conveyed to souls the grace of the Spirit, which is in scripture
   frequently compared to water: but we render the word galleries; as does
   R. David Kimchi, [869] and after him Junius and Tremellius. In the
   eastern countries, galleries ran along by the sides of great houses,
   and were a common passage to the rooms in them; [870] and which will
   well suit with the ordinances, which are those galleries where Christ
   and believers walk and converse together; where he discovers the
   secrets of his love, and leads them into a farther acquaintance with
   his covenant grace; from whence they have delightful views of his
   precious person; who having been some time absent from them, they now
   from hence behold him coming towards them, "leaping upon the mountains,
   and skipping upon the hills;" here they are oftentimes indulged with
   Pisgah views; and not only see the king in his beauty, but also beheld
   the good land which is very far off. But,

   3dly, I shall next consider what is meant by this great person's being
   held there. The word signifies a being bound, as a prisoner, with
   chains and fetters: R. Aben Ezra and Al-shech acknowledge, that the
   Messiah is here intended; and tell us, that it was the opinion of their
   ancient Rabbins, that he was born the day that Jerusalem was destroyed:
   and if yea ask the modern Jews, why then they are so unbelieving
   concerning him? they will tell you, that though he was then born, he is
   not yet revealed; and if you ask where he now is, some of them will
   tell you, that he is in paradise, where he lies tied and bound with the
   locks of womens hair, which are like to the frizzles and curlings of
   water in canals; to support which whim of theirs, they torture this
   text of ours, and read it thus; ;the hair of thine head is like purple,
   with which the king is tied or hound in the walks or canals; [871] that
   is, in paradise. But though the king Messiah is here represented as one
   bound as a prisoner, yet not in this ridiculous sense; but his being
   held or bound in the galleries or ordinances of his house, shows, 1.
   How much his heart was ravished and captivated with the beauty of his
   church; it struck him with so much wonder, and filled him with so much
   pleasure, that he was like one bound in chains, and could, not stir
   hand nor foot; had, no power to move along, nor could he take his eye
   off her; but stood and gazed upon her, as one surprised and astonished
   at her. Or, 2. It is expressive of Christ's fixed habitation in his
   house and ordinances: for though believers do not always perceive him,
   yet he always is there; he has promised so to be, and he is as good as
   his word; nay, he takes delight and pleasure in being there, and that,
   as much as any man can, to be in his own house, and to walk in the
   galleries of it; "This is my rest for ever," says he (Ps. 132:14),
   "here will I dwell, for I have desired it:" he is, as it were, tied and
   fastened to its rafters, and bound in its galleries. Or, 3. It may be
   meant of any earthly king or prince whatever; and then the sense is as
   Junius gives it: There is no king so great and glorious, if he should
   behold thy beauty and glory, but would stand amazed at it; and would be
   held with a perpetual desire of seeing it, esteeming it far above his
   own or the glory of the whole world: and indeed, the earthly glory and
   grandeur of the greatest prince and monarch in the universe, is far
   inferior to that of Christ's church; if Solomon, in all his glory, was
   not arrayed like one of the lilies of the field, much less is any king
   or prince to be compared with Christ's lily, the church: but, though
   this sense serves much to set off the church's glory and beauty; yet I
   rather choose the other, which best expresses the affection of Christ,
   and the astonishing beauty of his church.

   II.In verse 6, Christ gives a general and comprehensive summary of his
   church's beauty; and at the same time expresses the strongest affection
   for her, saying, "How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for
   delights." Where may be observed,

   1st, The title he gives her, "O love." The church is Christ's love,
   both objectively and subjectively; she is the object of his love, who
   he loved from all eternity; loves in time without any change or
   variation, and will love to all eternity, without the least
   interruption: she is also one who dearly loves Christ, in whose heart
   that grace dwells and reigns; which she discovers by her regard to his
   person, value for his ordinances, and respect to his commands: of this
   title, see more on chapter 1:9, though indeed a different word is here
   made use of, and that more full and expressive, both of Christ's love
   to her, and hers to Christ, than is there; she is called love in the
   abstract; as being all over love, love itself, nothing else but love,
   and altogether lovely in his esteem.

   2dly, The commendations that are given of her are, 1. That she is fair;
   and so she is, not in herself, but in Christ; not in her own nature and
   righteousness, which are unclean, but in his own person and
   righteousness, which are without spot and blemish; not as she is now
   considered in this imperfect state, but as she shall he hereafter, when
   she shall be presented "a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or
   any such thing:" though now; in Christ's eye; she is all fair, and
   there is no spot in her; but this commendation we have frequently met
   with. 2. She is also said to be pleasant; which epithet is by her given
   to Christ, in chapter 1:16, which he here returns to her; it being
   usual in this song for these two excellent lovers so to do. The church
   now was pleasant to Christ, and that for delights; he having loved her,
   not only with a love of benevolence, but with a love of complacency and
   delight; and that before the foundation of the world, as appears from
   Proverbs 8:31. The church, I say, is pleasant to him, as she is his
   spouse and bride; for though she is as the loving hind, and pleasant
   roe unto him; and as she is the portion and inheritance, of which he
   says, "the lines are fallen to me in pleasant places;" and also as she
   is his friend and intimate acquaintance, she is pleasant to him, as
   Jonathan was to David. Moreover, she is so as she is clothed with his
   righteousness, and adorned with the graces of his Spirit; her
   countenance is comely; her voice, both in prayer and praise, is sweet;
   her faith and love are ravishing, and her company delightful; in short,
   he takes abundance of satisfaction and pleasure in her: she was all
   delight [872] to him; her countenance, some, actions, and gesture. And
   therefore,

   3dly, Expresses it after the manner he does, "How fair and how pleasant
   art thou!" that is, thou art incomparably and inexpressibly so; none
   can tell how fair thou art in my eye, and how pleasant and delightful
   thou art unto me; it is beyond all human thought and expression: What
   astonishing love and grace now appears in all this, that one so great
   and glorious, as this royal person is, should be so much in love and
   pleasure in such poor, vile, with, and take so much delight and sinful
   creatures, as we are!

Chapter 7 Verse 7

   This thy stature is like to a palm-tree,
   and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word , having gone through the ten particular instances of his
   church's beauty, in the five first verses of this chapter, and given a
   comprehensive summary of the whole, in verse 6, one would have thought
   he had done; but as not satisfied with the commendations he had given,
   and as not knowing when nor how to give over, the subject being so
   delightful to him, begins anew in these words; where he,

   I.In general commends her stature, by comparing it to a palm-tree.

   II.Her breasts in particular, which are likened to "clusters of
   grapes."

   I.He compares her stature to a "palm-tree." Her stature is what arises
   from and is made up of the above said parts, which he had commended, as
   is manifest from the relative this; which being all set in their proper
   place, and in a just proportion, as the members of the church are by
   God (see 1 Cor. 12:12-18), look very beautiful and comely: the word
   properly signifies height, tallness, and straightness: to be of a tall
   stature, was accounted very honorable, and an indication of majesty;
   such an one was fit to be chosen a king, as Saul was, who "was higher
   than any of the people; from his shoulders and upwards;" and when
   Samuel came to anoint one of the sons of Jesse, as king in his stead,
   the first-born, Eliab, was presented to him; who, when he saw his
   comely countenance, and the height of his stature, judged him to be the
   Lord's anointed; but the Lord bid him not look on these things, nor
   judge according to them as man does, for he was not the person he had
   his eye upon. As the tallness of men is expressed by the palm-tree;
   thus Moses is said to be admired by the Ethiopians for his beautiful
   stature, like the palm-tree; [873] so the simile of a tree, as here of
   a palm-tree, is not an improper one to express the tall stature of
   women; so Galatea is, for height and tallness, compared to an alder and
   to a plane-tree; [874] and Helena, to a cypress-tree in a garden, [875]
   on the same account: and if Solomon here has any reference to Pharoah's
   daughter, his wife, since the Egyptian palm-tree is said to be the
   best, [876] he might think of that, which is described "of body
   straight, high, round and slender;" [877] and fitly expresses a good
   shape and stature, which recommended a person to their lovers. [878]
   Now the church being here represented as tall of stature, may be
   expressive of her royal majesty and greatness; and so the Septuagint
   render the words, "This thy greatness is like to the palm-tree." [879]
   Moreover, tallness of stature was ever accounted no small addition to
   beauty; and therefore women have, in former as well as in latter ages,
   wore ornaments upon the very top of their heads, as well as high shoes
   on their feet, to make them appear the taller and perhaps this was the
   reason why the Jewish women walked "with stretched-forth necks," as is
   observed in Isaiah 3:16, so that this may be taken notice of by Christ,
   as a commendation of the church's beauty. The palm-tree is a beautiful
   tree; and some have been compared to it for their beauty; thus Homer
   [880] compares the beauty of Nausicaa to the tender branch of a
   palm-tree; here the church is compared to it for her stature: and to be
   of a tall stature, is in many cases useful; and such, in many
   instances, have the advantage of others; Zaccheus, because he was low
   of stature, was obliged to climb a sycamore-tree, or he had lost the
   sight of Christ, which he was so desirous of gratifying his curiosity
   with, But to proceed: by the church's stature, is meant no other than
   that "measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ?" mentioned in
   Ephesians 4:13, which the church and all true believers are growing up
   to, and shall arrive at; for which reason the means of grace, the
   ministry of the word, and the ordinances of the gospel, are instituted
   and continued: and then will the church have arrived to this stature,
   when all the elect are gathered in, and every member joined to the
   body; and these all filled with the several gifts and graces of the
   Spirit designed for them; and are all grown up to a just proportion in
   the body: and in this state and condition Christ seems to view his
   church here; and therefore gives her this commendation. Now to this
   stature no addition can be made, but by the grace and Spirit of God; as
   no man, "by taking thought" or projecting ever so many ways and
   methods, "can add one cubit unto his bodily stature;" so none can, by
   any methods of their own, add to their spiritual stature, nor to the
   stature of the church of Christ: it is the Spirit of God that convinces
   and converts sinners; he works upon their wills and affections, and
   powerfully inclines their hearts to give themselves first to the Lord,
   and then to the churches; and when they are planted there, it is he
   that, by the effusions and influences of his grace, makes them grow up
   as "willows by the water-courses."

   Now this stature of the church, is by Christ compared to a palm-tree: a
   tree well known in Judea, where great plenty of them grew; and as Pliny
   [881] says, the noblest and best of this sort of trees, and especially
   about Jericho; which is frequently in scripture called "the city of
   palm trees;" as is Engedi sometimes called Hazazon-tamar, from the
   palm-trees which grew there: and some [882] have observed that this
   tree, in future times, became an emblem of that country; and therefore
   the coin of several of the Roman princes had the figure of a palm-tree
   upon them, and particularly Vespasian's and the medal of the emperor
   Titus was struck with the figure of a captive woman, sitting under a
   palm tree, with this inscription on it, Judaea capta, "Judaea is
   taken:" the metaphor is taken, as are usually all the metaphors,
   similies and comparisons in this book, from what was well known in this
   country; and it is no unusual thing in scripture for saints to be
   compared to palm-trees; in Psalm 92:12, it is said "the righteous shall
   flourish like the palm-tree;" and in Solomon's temple, which was a
   figure of the church of Christ, were palm-trees carved upon all the
   wails of the house round about, and upon the doors of the oracle; to
   teach us, that none but saints ought to have a place in God's house
   below, or shall be admitted into heaven above, signified by the oracle,
   or holy of holies: also in Ezekiel's temple, which was shown him in a
   vision, were palm-trees and cherubim; between every cherub and cherub
   was a palm-tree; which temple was either a figure of the gospel-church,
   or of the church-triumphant in glory; and if that is true as some [883]
   have thought, that the places of the fallen angels are filled up with
   men redeemed by Christ; that the same number are redeemed among the
   one, as fell among the other; this description would give a beautiful
   illustration of it; for as a cherub and a palm-tree, a cherub and a
   palm-tree, were placed in this order throughout the house; so an angel
   and a saint, an angel and a saint, an equal number of each according to
   this notion, will be in the heavenly glory. But, to consider a little
   particularly why the church, and all true believers, may be compared to
   palm-trees: and they may, for these following reasons: 1. The palm-tree
   grows up very tall, straight and upright; [884] and therefore the idols
   of the Gentiles are compared unto it, in Jeremiah 10:5, "they are
   upright as the palm-tree:" and saints may be said to be so in a
   spiritual sense; and that if we consider them either in the exercise of
   their faith, or in the motions of their affections, or in the tendency
   of their desires, or agreeableness of their conversations; their faith
   looks straight upwards to a Christ above, and fixes its eye upon his
   person, blood, and righteousness; and does not look downwards to its
   frames, duties, services or performances: their affections move
   heavenwards, and are set on things above, and not on things on earth;
   and therefore are Compared to pillars of smoke, which move straight
   upwards, and which rise up in the form of palm-trees, as has been
   observed on chapter 3:6, their desires also steer the same course, and
   move after Christ; they want to have a larger knowledge of him, mote
   communion with him, and a neater conformity to him; they are breathing
   after the heavenly joys; and having seen the vanity and emptiness of
   this world, and the things of it, desire the better country and
   continuing city, which God is the builder and maker of; and long to be
   unclothed of this mortal body, that they might be clothed with their
   house from. heaven: thus, like the palm-tree, their souls move upward
   in their faith in, love to, and desires after Christ, and those unseen
   glories which he is preparing for his people: and as they are upright
   in their hearts, so they are in their conversations, which are often in
   heaven, and employed about heavenly things, even whilst they are here
   on earth, which renders them becoming the gospel of Christ Jesus. 2.
   The palm-tree will grow straight and upright, even though many weights
   are hung upon it: [885] saints have many weights and pressures upon
   them; the apostle says (Heb. 12:1), "let us lay aside every weight;"
   which shows that they have more than one; they have a body of sin and
   death, which presses them hard, and makes them groan, being burdened
   with it; as also a variety of afflictions which attend them; as well as
   a load of reproaches and censures thrown upon them by the world, which
   often fall very hard and heavy; besides the many persecutions of
   various sorts which they endure; and yet, as the apostle says (2 Cor.
   4:8, 9), though they "are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;"
   they "are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, hut not forsaken;
   cast down, but not destroyed;" they are supported under all, and still
   grow upright like the palm-tree; "none of these things move" them, to
   turn or bend either one way or another; nor tempt them to desert the
   cause they have espoused; but continue in it with an unshaken mind, and
   a courageous and magnanimous spirit; so R. Solomon Jarchi applies this
   to the Jewish church, which stood as upright, as the palm-tree,
   refusing to be guilty of idolatry, in Nebuchadnezzar's time, when other
   nations bowed and fell down before his golden image: nay, saints not
   only bear up under all these weights and pressures, but oftentimes grow
   the more in their faith, love, knowledge and experience, under them; as
   the children of Israel, who the more they were afflicted, the more they
   grew and multiplied. 3. The palm-tree is a fruit-bearing tree; it bears
   the fruit which is called dates, which is not only of a beautiful
   aspect, but of a delightful taste, and it is fit both for food and
   drink; [886] and this perhaps was the reason why the children of Israel
   pitched their camp at Elim (Num. 33:9), because there were not only
   "twelve fountains of water" there, but also "threescore and ten
   palm-trees:" the saints, being implanted and engrafted in Christ Jesus,
   and abiding in him, bring forth fruit; they are laden with all the
   blessings of the everlasting covenant, the graces of the Spirit, and
   the precious fruits of righteousness; all which fruit they have from
   Christ, who is their "green fir-tree." 4. Naturalists [887] tell us,
   that the vital force or power of the palm-tree is not in its root, as
   in other trees, but in its top, which they call the cerebrum, or brain;
   and that if its top is lopped off, it immediately becomes barren: [888]
   the saints life is not in themselves, but in their head, Christ Jesus;
   it is from him they receive all their grace and strength, their life
   and nourishment, their fruit and fruitfulness; and it was possible that
   any separation could be made between them and their head, they would
   not only become barren and unfruitful, but entirely dead and lifeless.
   5. The leaves of the palm-tree are always green; it has on the top of
   it a tuft of leaves four feet long, which never fall off, but always
   continue upon it in the same verdure; it is a tree which never rots:
   [889] the saints are frequently compared to trees in scripture, and
   that to such whose leaves do not wither, as in Psalm 1:3; Jeremiah
   17:8, when hypocrites and carnal professors are called dendra
   fqinspwrina, "trees that are withered in autumn;" [890] at which time
   not only the fruit is gone but the leaves fall: but saints being
   engrafted in Christ, and planted by the rivers of divine love and
   grace, continually retain their verdure, shall never perish, but
   persevere for ever. 6. The palm-tree is very long-lived, [891] and
   continues flourishing a long time; it is, as Dr Shaw [892] was
   informed, in its greatest vigor about thirty years after it is planted,
   and continues in full vigor seventy years more, bearing all this while
   every year about three or four hundred pounds weight of dates; and
   Symmachus renders the words here; "this thine" age is like unto the
   palm-tree: hence the flourishing of the righteous is compared unto it,
   in Psalm 92:12, in opposition to that of the wicked, in 5:7, which is
   said to be as the flourishing of grass, which is soon over, and
   continues but a short time; but the palm-tree abides so for many years,
   as before observed: [893] and this may be expressive of the
   perseverance of the saints, whose grace is immortal and incorruptible;
   whose persons shall never perish, nor ever be subject to the second
   death, but shall live for evermore. 7. The palm-tree grows and
   flourishes best in hot and sunny places; [894] it will not grow in cold
   countries, and therefore we have it not here: so saints, being "planted
   in the house of the Lord," where in the ordinances, they sitting under
   the warm and quickening beams of the "sun of righteousness," Christ
   Jesus, "flourish in the courts of our God;" these are the best places
   for them, namely, the house and ordinances of God; here thy delight to
   be, and here they thrive most, because here "the Lord is a sun and a
   shield" unto them. 8. Branches of the palm-tree have been used as
   tokens of joy and emblems of victory; the Jews had a feast of
   tabernacles, which they kept as a time of rejoicing; and among other
   demonstrations of joy, this was only to carry palm-tree branches in
   their hands (Lev. 23:40), as did also much people of the Jews, when
   Christ rode in triumph to Jerusalem, as an indication of the joy they
   were filled with at his coming, and to welcome him into their city
   (John 12:13), so likewise the saints are described, who were come out
   of great tribulations, and had got the victory over all their enemies,
   as "clothed with white robes, and palms or palm-tree branches in their
   hands," (Rev. 7:9), saints, of all persons in the world, have reason to
   rejoice in the views of an atoning sacrifice, a justifying
   righteousness, and peace and pardon by Christ Jesus, through whom they
   are made "more than conquerors" over sin, Satan, and the world; and a
   number of these, with palm-tree branches in their hands, will look like
   so many palm-trees. But,

   II.The church's breasts in particular are commended by Christ, and
   compared to "clusters of grapes:" this part has been already commended
   in chapter 4:5, and is repeated in verse 3 of this chapter; but here a
   different metaphor is made use of; there they are compared to "two
   young roes that are twins," here to "clusters of grapes"; The word
   grapes is not in the Hebrew text; though the Targum supplies it, as our
   Translators do: R. Ahen Ezra thinks, that clusters of the vine are
   meant, which might be planted by, and run up upon the palm-tree; though
   I should rather think, that "clusters of dates," the fruit of the
   palm-tree itself, are here intended; especially seeing this fruit, as
   Pliny [895] observes, grows in clusters, hanging upon the shoots, like
   bunches of grapes: moreover, her breasts are compared to: "clusters of
   the vine," in the following verse; and it does not appear so probable,
   that Christ should use the same metaphor, to commend the same part in
   two verses together. What we are to understand by the church's breasts,
   has been shown on chapter 4:5, but seeing a different metaphor is made
   use of here, it may not be improper to observe the agreement between
   them, And,

   1st, By her breasts may be meant the ministers of the gospel. R.
   Solomon Jarchi would have Daniel, Hananiah, Misheel and Azariah, here
   understood who were as breasts to others in captivity: but it is much
   better to understand them of gospel-ministers; who not only direct men
   where they may have food, invite them to it, and dissuade them from
   every thing that would be pernicious to them; but also feed them
   themselves, with "the sincere milk of the word", and bread of life;
   they rightly divide "or cut the word of truth" and, as wise and
   faithful stewards, give to every one their portion of meat in due
   season. These may be compared to clusters, either of grapes or dates,
   1. Because of their number: it is a great mercy to the churches of
   Christ, when there are plenty of gospel-ministers; Christ advised his
   disciples to pray for it, because the "harvest was plenteous," and
   laborers were but few (Matthew 9:37, 38). 2. Because of their unity,
   likeness and agreement; for though they have gifts and grace differing
   from each other, one has more than another has; yet they have one and
   the same commission, and preach one and the same Christ as the only way
   of salvation, though they may not be attended with equal success. 3.
   Like dusters of dates, the fruit of the palm-tree, they are the fruit
   of the church; and such are the best ministers, who are educated and
   brought up in churches, and approved and sent out by them. Or else,

   2dly, By the church's breasts may be meant, the Old and New Testaments;
   which, like breasts, are full of the "milk of the word;" than which, no
   two breasts are more like one another; like the two cherubim upon the
   mercy-seat, they look towards each other: these may be compared to
   clusters, because there are in them clusters of excellent doctrines and
   precious promises; there are not only here and there a berry, but
   clusters of them; which being pressed and squeezed by hearing, reading,
   meditation and prayer, yield both delight and nourishment to men. Or
   else,

   3dly, By them may be meant the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's
   supper, which are "breasts of consolation" to believers; and when they
   have the presence of Christ in them, and the discoveries of his love to
   them, then they are not "dry breasts;" they cannot say, they have "no
   cluster to eat ;" but as when there is "new wine found in the cluster,"
   and one saith, "destroy it not, for a blessing is in it," (Isa. 65:8),
   so have they much pleasure, satisfaction and delight therein: and the
   church's breasts being thus like clusters full in themselves are also
   delightful and beautiful in Christ's eye, and therefore are thus
   commended by him.

Chapter 7 Verse 8

   I said I will go up to the palm-tree, I will take hold of the boughs
   thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the
   smell of thy nose like apples..
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having compared the church to a palm-tree and her breasts to
   "clusters of dates," the fruit thereof, does here,

   I.Make a resolution or promise to go up into its and "take hold of the
   boughs thereof."

   II.Mentions several effects following upon his putting this resolution
   into practice, or fulfilling this promise; two of which we have an
   account of in these words: as, 1st, That her breasts should be filled,
   and become like "clusters of the vine." 2dly, "The smell of her nose"
   should be "like apples."

   I.We have in these words Christ's resolution or promise which consists
   of two parts: 1st, He resolves to "go up to the palm-tree." 2dly, When
   there, to "take hold of the boughs thereof."

   1st, He signifies it as his will, to "go up to the palm-tree." Some
   popish [896] writers have fancied that the cross of Christ, or at least
   some part of it, was made of the wood of the palm-tree; to support
   which they have no sufficient proof or evidence; though it is not very
   unlikely, seeing there was such plenty of those sort of trees in Judea,
   as has been observed on the former verse: and therefore, some [897]
   have thought, that by Christ's going up to the palm-tree, is meant his
   crucifixion, which he expresses by being lifted up, in John 12:32.
   Moreover, his going up to it may signify his voluntary submission unto
   death, even the "death of the cross:" besides, the palm-tree being an
   emblem of victory, may represent the conquest which Christ has obtained
   over all his and our enemies; he has destroyed sin, overcome the world,
   abolished death, spoiled principalities and powers, and made a show of
   them, openly triumphing over them on the cross.

   Though others [898] have thought, that by Christ's going up to the
   palm-tree, are meant his ascension into heaven, his conjunction with
   his church there, and that unspeakable pleasure which he will take in
   her for evermore: it is true, Christ not only ascended to his God and
   our God, to his Father and our Father; but also went up to the church
   triumphant, which may very fitly be compared to a palm-tree; the saints
   there appearing with "white robes and palms, palm-tree-branches in
   their hands;" as a token of that joy they are possessed of, and of that
   victory over all their enemies, which they are sharers in, through
   Christ Jesus: and it was the delightful company of these persons, which
   Christ had in view in becoming a surety for them, assuming their
   nature, and dying in their room and stead; it was this "joy that was
   set before him," which caused him so patiently to "endure the cross,
   despising the shame" which attended it. Though I am rather inclined to
   think, that by the palm-tree here, we are to understand the church
   militant, as in the foregoing verse; and Christ's going up into it; is
   expressive, 1. Of his right unto, and property in his church: she is
   his by the gift of the Father, and by the purchase of his own blood, as
   well as by the conquest of his powerful and efficacious grace; on which
   account he claims an interest in her, and says, "I have redeemed thee,
   I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine;" and she is very free to
   own and acknowledge this rightful claim unto her, as it is her honor,
   interest, and duty so to do: this palm-tree is of his own planting; he
   waters it every moment; he keeps it night and day; he prunes it, and
   makes it fruitful; and therefore has a right to go up into it when he
   pleases. 2. Of his presence with her, so Christ is said to be "among
   the myrtle-trees," in Zechariah 1:8, as he is here said to go up into
   the palm-tree: and this is the grand reason why the church is at any
   time in a flourishing condition, and like the palm-tree, grows, though
   never such weights and pressures are upon it; because Christ is in the
   midst of her, and grants his gracious and supporting presence to her.
   3. Of his delight in her: he loves to be in her presence and company,
   as men do to go up into their trees, and handle the boughs thereof. His
   saints are "the excellent in the earth," in whom his delight was before
   the world began, and now is and ever will be: the mutual delight which
   appears in the bride and bridegroom, falls short of expressing that
   which Christ takes in his church; he "rejoices over her with joy; he
   rests in his love towards her, and joys over her with singing," (Zech.
   3:17).

   Now from Christ's going up into his palm-tree, the church, we are not
   to imagine that the church is higher than Christ, for he is far
   superior to her; and it is an instance of his grace and condescension,
   that he will take notice of her, and grant his presence to her; he is
   her head and husband, her Lord and king, and therefore she is inferior,
   and ought to be in subjection to him; and though he was in our nature,
   and that by reason of suffering in it, made "a little lower than the
   angels;" yet he is vastly higher than they, yea, higher than the
   heavens themselves. But this expression here is suited, and is very
   agreeable to the metaphor here made use of. The palm-tree is a very
   tall tree; and its boughs and branches do not grow out of the sides, as
   in many other trees, but only on the top of it; so that whosoever would
   lay hold upon them, and gather the fruit, must go up into it: moreover,
   the trunk and body of it is made with rings in the bark of it, like
   steps; so that it may be very easily climbed, which is done by the
   eastern people, with an incredible swiftness: [899] these steps are
   made of the knots or polices, as Dr Shaw [900] calls them, being
   gradually left upon the trunk of the tree, serve, like so many rounds
   of a ladder, to climb up the tree, either to fecundate it, or to lop
   it, or to gather the fruit: Lucian [901] observes that "those who have
   seen how men get up into palm-trees, in Arabia, Egypt, and other
   places, must needs understand what he says, about climbing the Phalli
   in the temple of Hyrapolis in Syria, he is describing."

   2dly, Going up into the palm-tree, is in order to take hold on the
   boughs of it. The palm-tree has no boughs nor branches growing out of
   the sides of the trunk of it, as before observed, but shoots upon the
   top of it, on which its fruit hangs; and the Septuagint renders it, "I
   will take hold of the heights of it ;" some render it, the fruit of it,
   as the Vulgate Latin version; to which Kircher inclines: and this
   ascent to the top of it was, either to gather the fruit, or to crop the
   shoots themselves, and eat them; for the tops of them, which are of the
   first year's growth, are very tender and sweet, and may be eaten; [902]
   so the top of the palm-tree, which some call the cerebrum, or brain, is
   very sweet; [903] and is spoken of as very pleasant and nourishing.
   [904] Christ's end in doing this may be twofold: 1. To gather the
   fruits of it; which he has an undoubted right unto; they are his:
   whether we understand by them the blessings of grace, which believers
   are possessed of; or the graces of the Spirit, which are implanted in
   them; or the good works which they are enabled to perform; these all
   come from him; he is the "green fir-tree," from whom all the believers
   "fruit is found;" therefore he may lay hold on the boughs, and gather
   the fruit when he pleases; in doing which, he takes much delight and
   pleasure, and is kindly invited by his church thereunto: see chapter
   4:16. 2. His other end in laying hold on the boughs, may be to prune
   them, that they may bring forth more fruit; this he does sometimes by
   his word, and the preaching of it: by which sin is corrected, error
   refuted, and sharp reproofs and admonitions given on the account of
   both; for as the word is as an ax to cut down sturdy and obstinate
   sinners; so it is as a pruning knife in Christ's hand, to remove all
   "superfluity of naughtiness," which hinders the growth of his trees and
   plants: sometimes also Christ prunes his churches by the ordinance of
   excommunication; by which he lops off unfruitful branches, such who are
   unfit for communion in his churches; which awful sentence is executed
   sometimes more mildly, and sometimes more severely, according to the
   nature of the offense; sometimes it is expressed in scripture by a
   withdrawing from disorderly persons; at other times, by a rejecting of
   heretics; as also, by putting away such who are notoriously vile and
   wicked: again, Christ prunes his people likewise by afflictive
   providences, by which their iniquity is purged, their graces are tried
   and exercised, and they made under those sharp trials, to yield the
   peaceable fruits of righteousness: moreover Christ sometimes effects
   this work by suffering persecution to befall his churches; this sun
   scorches up those plants, which are not of Christ's planting, and are
   not rooted in his person and grace; this is the fan which Christ
   sometimes takes in his hand, and "thoroughly purges his floor," the
   church, of hypocrites and formal professors; this is his pruning-knife,
   with which he lops off those fruitless and withered branches. This is
   an awful way of pruning the boughs of his palm-tree.

   It may be observed, that these words are delivered in the form of a
   purpose or promise, "I said I will go up," etc. Christ thinks, and then
   resolves, before he acts; he does all things deliberately, and
   according to the counsel of his own will, and always for his own glory
   and his church's good: moreover, this being a promise of Christ's, the
   performances of it may be expected by his people; for "he is faithful
   who hath promised;" it may also be pleaded by them: Has he promised to
   go up into his palm-tree, or grant his presence in his church? He will
   be as good as his word; his people may expect his presence there; and
   they are allowed to put him in mind of such a promise, which they need
   not doubt the fulfillment of. But,

   II.Let us now consider the effects of Christ's going up into his
   palm-tree: and we find two of them mentioned in this verse, and a third
   in the following one:

   1st, The church's breasts become like "clusters of the vine;" that is,
   of grapes which grow in clusters on the vine: [905] which words may be
   considered, either as a wish, and be read thus, "and now let thy
   breasts be as the clusters of the vine;" [906] or else, as a promise
   that they should be so; which accordingly was effected by his granting
   his presence to her, which filled her breasts, and made them like
   clusters of the vine. By which may be meant, either, 1. The ministers
   of the gospel; who not only direct men where the wine and milk of
   gospel-grace may be had, and invite them to it, but do also themselves
   feed them with "the sincere milk of the word;" with which they are
   filled, by Christ's granting his presence to them in their studies and
   meditations; and are brought forth by him at proper opportunities,
   laden with "the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ;" so
   that these breasts look like clusters of the vine. Or, 2. By them may
   be meant the ordinances; which are "breasts of consolation" to God's
   people, When they have the presence of Christ in them, otherwise they
   are but dry breasts; it is that which fills them with milk for
   nourishment, and with wine for refreshment. Or, 3. The two Testaments,
   with those dusters of excellent doctrines and precious promises that
   are in them; which, when men have the presence of Christ, either in the
   hearing or reading of them, yield them much delight and comfort, though
   at other times they are but as a dead letter. Though, 4. This may in
   general intend that influence, which Christ's presence has on the
   fruitfulness of his people; it is this which makes them fat and
   flourishing, brisk, and lively in the exercise of grace, fruitful in
   every good word and work; so that they g row and thrive in every grace,
   and are not barren and unfruitful in the knowledge of Christ Jesus.

   2dly, Another effect of Christ's going up into his palm-tree, or of his
   presence in his church, is, that "the smell of her nose" thereby
   becomes like that of apples. Formerly it was usual to anoint the
   nostrils, [907] which was reckoned very healthful and refreshing to the
   head; as well as was done, that they might give the more agreeable
   smell: and some sort of ointments, it seems, gave a smell like that of
   apples, which in some is very grateful and delightful; and Cicero [908]
   observes, that the plenty and variety of apples, their pleasant taste
   and smell, show that they were only made for men: and indeed there was
   an ointment made of them, called melinum; so that the nostrils being
   anointed with it, might well be said to smell like apples; and which
   was accounted one of the best. [909] By which apples may be meant,
   either, 1. The refreshing doctrines of the gospel from Christ's
   ministers; who are the church's nose, and are capable of distinguishing
   truth from error: these doctrines which they preach, when fitly spoken,
   seasonably applied, and attended with the power and presence of Christ
   to poor souls, are like "apples of gold in pictures of silver;" nay,
   not only like apples for sight, being beautiful to look upon, but also
   for smell; for these diffuse a sweet savor of the knowledge of Christ
   in the souls of his people. Or else, 2. The fame and report of the
   church's faith, piety and courage, which was spread far and near; her
   faith, for its strength and purity, is compared in verse 4 to "a tower
   of ivory;" and her courage and magnanimity in defending, this faith
   against all opposition, is expressed by her nose, being "as the tower
   of Lebanon, which looketh towards Damascus:" now the smell, fame or
   report of all this, like the smell of apples, was diffused abroad, and
   gained her credit and reputation, even from others; she having, like
   those heroes, in Hebrews 11, "obtained a good report through faith."
   Or, 3. It may be expressive both of her outward conversation and inward
   constitution, which were both sound and healthful; she had an inward
   principle of grace, from whence proceeded a savory conversation
   without; the hidden man of her heart, was that which is not
   corruptible, which sent forth, not a nauseous, but a grateful odor; no
   rotten nor corrupt communication proceeds from hence, but what is not
   only edifying to others, but grateful to Christ; and nothing has a
   greater influence than the presence of Christ, to make her inward
   constitution and outward conversation so. Though, 4. This may intend
   the savoriness of those things which she smelt, which were as grateful
   to her as the smell of apples: thus spiritual and heavenly thinks, the
   divine truths and excellent doctrines of the gospel, are exceeding
   savory to believers, especially when they have the presence of Christ,
   the discoveries of his love, and the quickening influences of his
   Spirit. The third effect follows in the next verse.

Chapter 7 Verse 9

   And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, for my beloved,
   that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep, to
   speak.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words contain the third effect of Christ's going up into his
   palm-tree, or granting his presence to his church: in which may be
   considered,

   I.What is meant by the "roof of her month."

   II.Why it is compared to "the best wine."

   III.The commendations of this best wine, to which it is compared;
   which, 1st, Is commended from the person, for whose use it is: "for my
   beloved." 2dly, From the property of it; "it goeth down sweetly." 3dly,
   From its effect; "causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak."

   I.It will be proper to inquire what we are to understand by the roof of
   the church's mouth. And, 1. By it may be meant her taste; the same word
   is so rendered in chapter 2:3.The church's taste is good, and not like
   that of unconverted persons; whose taste remains in them, as it is
   vitiated and corrupted by sin; so that they are not capable of
   discerning the difference of things; and therefore call evil good, and
   good evil; put bitter for sweet; and sweet for bitter; but so is not
   the church's taste; she can discern perverse things; her taste is like
   the best wine, she can tell whether it is good or no: tho' perhaps this
   expression is not so much intended to signify the goodness of her sense
   of tasting, as the things which she tastes of, which are the person of
   Christ, and the words of his mouth; tastes that the Lord is good in his
   person, grace and office; and finds the doctrines which proceed out of
   his mouth, and the fruit which drops from him. sweeter to her taste
   than the honey or the honey-comb. 2. R. Aben Ezra thinks that the
   saliva, or spittle under the tongue, is here meant; and what may be
   intended by that, may be learnt from chapter 4:11, where it is said,
   that "honey and milk are under her tongue;" that is, the doctrines of
   the everlasting gospel, which she lays and keeps there, and rolls them
   as a sweet morsel in her mouth, having tasted the goodness of them;
   herein she appears to be exceeding different from carnal and
   unconverted persons, under whose lips the poison of asps is said to be
   (Rom. 3:13). 3. Others [910] think, that by the roof of her mouth, is
   meant her breath; which proceeds from thence, Was, sweet and of good
   smell, like the best wine; and not like the breath of carnal persons,
   whose throats are like an open sepulcher; from whence are daily belched
   out horrid oaths, dreadful curses and imprecations upon themselves and
   others, with cruelty and threatenings to the saints and people of God;
   but as for the church's breath, it is of a different nature; no rotten
   communication proceeds out of her mouth, but what may be for the use of
   edifying; she breathes out nothing but peace and love among her
   members, and also to others: and as for her prayers to God, which may
   be justly called the breathings of her soul; these are as sweet odors,
   being perfumed with the incense of Christ's mediation. Though, 4. I
   rather think, that by the roof of her mouth, is meant her speech, or
   the words of her mouth; for the roof of the mouth is an instrument of
   speech, as well as of tasting; and the same word is frequently rendered
   the mouth, as in chapter 5:16 (Prov. 5:3, 8:7), which may either intend
   her speech in common conversation; which, like the best wine, is
   warming, comforting, and refreshing to souls, as well as grateful to
   Christ: How many have been cold, dull, and lifeless, when they have
   first come into the conversation of the saints; and by it have been
   warmed, quickened, and refreshed, so that they have gone away With joy
   and tom-fret, blessing and praising God for such opportunities! Or
   else, by it may be meant the speech of the church in prayer or praise,
   which are both delightful and well-pleasing to Christ; her voice in
   either is sweet unto him, makes delightful music in his ears; though
   the prayers of the saints are but like the chatterings of a crane or
   swallow, yet they are gratefully received by him; as are also their
   praises, which are more esteemed by him, than the sacrifices of an ox
   or a bullock that has horns and hoofs: though I am most inclined to
   think that the gospel, which proceeds out of Christ's mouth, and is put
   into the mouth of his church, which is preached in the midst of her,
   and by her ministering servants; is here intended. Which brings us to
   consider,

   II.Why this is compared to the best wine: Perhaps the wine of Sharon
   may be referred to, which was so strong, that they mixed it two parts
   water and one wine; [911] tho' there were other places in Judea that
   had the first name for wine [912] ; the wine of Lebanon was very
   grateful for taste and smell (Hosea 14:7), where was a city, called
   Ampeloessa, [913] from the excellency of its wine. 1. That is the best
   wine which is pure and free from dregs and mixtures; that Which is upon
   the lees, well refined: such is the gospel, as preached by the faithful
   ministers of it, who are not as some, which corrupt the word of God;
   they do not mix it with their own inventions, but deliver out this wine
   of the gospel, neat and clean, as they have received it. 2. Wine that
   has age, is also accounted the best: thus saith Christ (Luke 5:39). "No
   man having drunk old wine, straightway desireth new; for he saith, the
   old is better:" the gospel is no novel doctrine; for though it is more
   clearly made known under the New Testament dispensation, than it was
   under the Old, yet it was known then; it was wrapped up in the types,
   shadows and sacrifices of the old law; it was preached before unto
   Abraham, nay, to our first parents in the garden; and was spoken of
   more or less, ever since, by the mouth of God's holy prophets, which
   have been since the world began. 3. The best wine is that which is of a
   good flavour, and delightful to the taste, as well as that which is of
   a good color: such is the gospel; it is like milk for nourishment, and
   like wine for pleasantness; nay, like Ezekiel's roll, as honey for
   sweetness; yea, the psalmist says (Ps. 119:103), that the words of
   God's mouth were sweeter than honey to his mouth. 4. Wine is of a
   cheering and reviving nature; it is what makes glad the heart of man;
   and therefore is proper to be given to those that be of heavy hearts,
   that they may drink and forget their poverty, and remember their misery
   no more of such a nature is the gospel; it being received by persons in
   distress, like the best wine; it cheers and revives their spirits, it
   makes them forget their spiritual poverty, and puts out of their minds
   their former misery and distress; whilst they behold what riches of
   grace are treasured up in Christ, and what ample provisions are there
   made for them; nay, it not only revives distressed and drooping souls,
   but such is the virtue and efficacy of it, that it will bring dead
   sinners to life; for it is the savor of life unto life to many. 5. The
   best wine is very refreshing to weary persons, who have been fatigued
   with labor and travel: the gospel is a word in season to him that is
   weary; it not only directs the weary soul where it may have rest,
   kindly invites unto it, but is also the instrument of bringing him into
   it. 6. Wine is reckoned a comforter and strengthener of the stomach;
   therefore the apostle Paul advised Timothy (1 Tim. 5:23), to use a
   little wine for his stomach sake; and his often infirmities: the
   doctrines of the gospel have a tendency to comfort souls; they are
   often blessed for that purpose; the ministers of it are employed herein
   on that account; and the Spirit of God does his work, and executes, his
   office as a comforter by them. Thus the gospel, the word; which is in
   and proceeds out of the church's mouth, may be compared to the best
   wine.

   III.I shall now consider the commendations given of this best wine of
   the gospel. And,

   1st, It is commended from the persons for whose use it is, for my
   beloved; and therefore must needs be the best: it is such wine as a man
   would give to his friend, whom he dearly loves; who, when he pays a
   visit to him, if he has any wine in the house, he shall be sure to have
   it; and if he has any better than the rest, it shall be at his service.
   But who are we to understand by this beloved, for whose use this wine
   is? And, 1. We may understand these words as the words of Christ,
   speaking to and of his church and people, whom, in chapter 5:1, he
   calls his beloved, and his friends; and these he treats as such, with
   his best wine; the gospel, which is chiefly designed for their good,
   comfort, and establishment, 2. If we take these words to be the words
   of the daughters of Jerusalem, as some do, and that not only these, but
   all that is Spoken in the preceding verses; then the beloved is Christi
   whom they call their own; having now arrived to a greater knowledge of
   him, and acquaintance with him, than they formerly had; see chapter 5:9
   and 6:1, nor need it be wondered at, that it should be expressed in the
   singular number, my beloved; seeing it may well be supposed, that but
   one of them spoke, and delivered these commendations of the church.
   Though; 3. I rather take them to be the words of the church, speaking
   to and of Christ; who, hearing such great things spoken in the
   commendations of herself, could hold no longer; but, as one [914]
   expresses it, snatches the word out of Christ's mouth, breaks in upon
   his discourse before he had done, and thrusts in these words, referring
   all the glory to him: it is as if she should say, Is the roof of my
   mouth like the best wine? it is for my beloved; it is of his making and
   providing, and in which his glory is much concerned, as well as my
   comfort; "for we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord;" he
   is the subject, the sum and substance of the gospel; it is designed for
   the manifestation of his grace; and the advancement of his glory; and
   its being so, makes it so comfortable and delightful to souls. Junius
   and Piscator render the word, most lovingly or most lovelily: and so
   understand it of the manner of this best wine, going down and being
   received by persons; but this is sufficiently expressed in the next
   clause, which I shall now consider.

   2dly, This wine of the gospel, is commended from the property of it,
   which is here mentioned; it goeth down sweetly, which words may be
   differently rendered, and as differently understood. And, 1. They may
   be translated thus, that walketh or moveth aright; as they are in
   Proverbs 23:31, where wine is also spoken of, and denotes its sparkling
   in the cup; which shows it to be a generous wine, of a good body, and
   that it has life and spirit in it; therefore the wise man, in the
   fore-mentioned place, advises not to look upon the wine when it is red,
   when it giveth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright,
   because when it is so, it is very ensnaring: but here is no such danger
   in this wine of the gospel; the pleasantness of which, both in the eyes
   of Christ .and of his church, may be here intended. 2. The words may be
   rendered thus, which goeth to my beloved straightway or directly; [915]
   and so may denote the direct tendency of the gospel to lead souls to
   Christ, and to advance his honor and glory; for the whole of it
   consists in this, Christ in us the hope of glory. Or, 3. Thus, it goeth
   or leadeth to righteousnesses; [916] for it is one principal part of
   the gospel to lead souls to the righteousness of Christ, which is
   clearly revealed therein; that, disclaiming all pretences to their own
   righteousness for justification, they may wholly and alone look unto,
   and depend upon that tot their acceptance with God, and justification
   in his sight: moreover, it also teaches them, that denying ungodliness
   and worldly lusts, they should live soberly, righteously, and godly in
   this present world. Or, 4. They may be thus rendered, that goeth or
   walketh to upright persons; [917] for so the word is rendered in
   chapter 1:4, and indeed it is to such persons that the gospel is of
   real service and advantage; to them that believe, it is the power of
   God unto salvation; it works effectually in their hearts; these receive
   it in the love of it; by them it is highly valued and esteemed; and to
   them it yields much solid comfort, pleasure and satisfaction. For with
   such, 4. It goeth down sweetly, as our translators have rendered the
   words: This wine of the gospel is received and taken down with all
   readiness by all those who have once tasted the sweetness, and felt the
   power of it; with them the gospel is no hard saying, and who can bear
   it? but, like the best wine that is very delightful: with some persons,
   the doctrines of the gospel, such as those of an eternal, personal
   election, particular redemption, powerful and efficacious grace in
   conversion, final perseverance, etc. are very disagreeable; but to
   believers in Christ, they are like wine that goeth down sweetly.

   3dly, This wine is commended, from the effect it has upon those who
   drink of it; it "causeth the lips of those that are asleep to speak."
   In which may be considered, 1st, The persons on whom it has this
   effect, "those that are asleep." 2dly, The effect itself, which it has
   upon them, "it causeth their lips to speak."

   1st, The persons on whom this wine of the gospel has this effect; and
   they are such who are asleep. The Hebrew word, [918] here used, is by
   some rendered ancient persons; for persons, when they are grown old,
   have not their senses so quick, nor are they so full of talk, but are
   more slow of speech, than when they were in their youthful days; yet
   Cicero [919] says, senectus est natura loquacior; and therefore this
   serves much for the commendation of this wine, that it should have such
   an effect upon such persons; for that must be noble and generous wine
   that invigorates old men, and fills them with a juvenile heat, warmth
   and sprightliness: it makes them loquacious, [920] which is one effect
   of wine, when freely drank; [921] and it softens the moroseness of
   ancient men; [922] wine is even said to make an ancient man dance.
   [923] But the word may very well, and perhaps better, be rendered as it
   is, "those that are asleep;" by which may be meant, either, 1. Sinners,
   who are in the dead and deep sleep of sin. These, (1.) As persons
   asleep, have not the free exercise of their senses; they do not see
   their lost, miserable and undone state by nature, nor their need of
   Christ, and the value of him: their ears are stopped, that they cannot
   hear, so as to understand the joyful sound; they have no taste nor
   savor of divine things; and many have arrived to such a prodigious
   pitch of wickedness, as to be past feeling, having their "consciences
   seared with an hot iron:" nay, in this they exceed persons that are
   asleep who, though they have not the free exercise of their senses
   whilst asleep, yet are not destitute of them; but these have no
   spiritual sense at all, but are "dead in trespasses and sins." (2.)
   Like persons asleep,, they are strengthless, and are not in a capacity
   to do any thing that is spiritually good of themselves: they cannot
   redeem themselves from destruction; they cannot fulfill the righteous
   law of God, nor satisfy divine justice; they have not power to begin,
   nor carry on a work of grace upon their souls; they cannot subdue their
   corruptions, nor withstand Satan's temptations, nor perform the duties
   of religion; these things are not effected by the might and power of
   man. (3.) Like persons asleep, they are inactive; "their strength is to
   sit still;" they have neither power nor will to do that which is good;
   "there is none that doeth good, no, not one;" they have no true
   knowledge of what is good; for though "they are wise to do evil, yet to
   do good they have no knowledge;" and if they had knowledge, they have
   no inclination; and if they had that, yet still they have no power;
   "for the Ethiopian may as soon change his skin, or the leopard his
   spots, as they do good that are accustomed to do evil." (4.) Like
   persons asleep, they are subject to illusions and mistakes; they are
   mistaken about the nature of the divine Being, whom they dither imagine
   to be such an one as themselves, who will either connive at sinful
   actions, or take little or no notice of them; or else, presume upon his
   absolute mercy, to go on in sin: and they are as much deceived about
   the nature of sin itself, which they now roll as a sweet morsel in
   their mouths, but will ere long find to be as gravel-stones: and so
   they are like-wise with respect to the ways of God, and people of
   Christ; in the former of which they suppose there is no true pleasure;
   and in the latter, no enjoyment of true felicity; but in nothing are
   they more mistaken than in themselves and their state; which they
   imagine to be good, when at the same time they are poor, and wretched,
   and miserable, and blind, and naked, (5.) Like persons asleep, they
   insensible of danger; they are walking in the broad road to
   destruction, and are upon the brink of it, and yet know it not; they
   are crying, Peace, peace, when sudden destruction is at hand. Or else,
   2. By. those that are asleep, may be meant drowsy professors: the wise
   as well as the foolish virgins slept; Christ's church may sometimes be
   in such a condition, as she was in chapter 5:2, this sleep is not a
   dead sleep, as the former; there may be life notwithstanding this, "I
   sleep, but my heart waketh:" this consists in a non-exercise of grace,
   an indifference to religious duties, a lukewarmness and want of zeal
   for the glory of Christ and his gospel, occasioned by the prevailings
   of sin and corruption; see more on chapter 5:2. But,

   2dly, Let us consider what effect the wine of the everlasting gospel
   has upon the above said persons; when it comes in power, and is
   received in the love of it, it causes their lips to speak. In the
   former of these persons, that is, in carnal and Christless sinners, it
   produces humble confessions of sin: it makes them speak in the praise
   of Christ and his grace, whereby salvation is procured for such lost
   and perishing creatures, as they by nature were; it brings them to the
   gates of Zion, there to declare to the saints the great things which
   God has done for them: it makes the tongue of the dumb to sing, who
   before had not one word to say for Christ, and of his grace; and those
   who were stammerers at these things, it makes them ready to speak
   plainly: as for the latter sort of persons, that is, sleepy and drowsy
   professors, it makes them speak-meanly and modestly of themselves, and
   very highly of Christ and his grace; for such souls who have drank the
   largest draughts of this wine, and have the greatest share of knowledge
   in gospel-truths, are the most humble; they are ready to acknowledge
   themselves the least of saints, and the chief of sinners: and none more
   frequent than they in magnifying Christ, and exalting the riches of his
   grace.

Chapter 7 Verse 10

   I am my beloved's, and his desire is towards me.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word having spoken largely in the commendation of his church's
   beauty, vouchsafed his presence to her, and made her drink of his best
   wine, which causes the lips of those that are asleep to speak: she,
   after a long silence breaks forth, as an effect of it. And,

   I.Claims her interest in him: "I am my beloved's."

   II.Takes notice of his love and affection to her: "and his desire is
   towards me."

   I.She signifies the satisfaction which she had in her soul, with
   respect to her being Christ's; which is an affair of the utmost
   concern; about which saints have often a great many doubts and fears;
   and a satisfaction in which he is exceeding desirable to them. The
   church has expressed herself in the same words twice before in this
   song; see chapter 2:16 and 6:3, therefore less will be required in the
   explication of them here. However, some things respecting the present
   frame and disposition of her, the agreement of these words with the
   context; and what has not been so carefully observed in the former
   texts, may be taken notice of here. And,

   1st, These words may be considered as expressive of that assurance of
   faith, which the church had of her union to and in Christ; it is as if
   she should say, After all these expressions of love unto me, and the
   sweet enjoyment of his presence which he has indulged me with, surely I
   may venture to say, that I am his; nay, I am sure that I am. From hence
   may be observed, 1. That the grace of assurance is attainable in this
   life; instances of which we have, not only in the New Testament saints,
   such as the apostle Paul, and others, who knew that Christ had loved
   him, and had given himself for him: was well satisfied both in his
   ability and fidelity, to keep what he had committed to him against
   another day, and was persuaded that there never would be a separation
   from his love; but also in Old Testament saints, as David, who could
   claim his interest in an everlasting covenant, and was assured of it,
   even in his dying moments and that in the prospect of the present and
   future ill state of his family; and Job, who knew that his redeemer
   lived, and that for him, even when he was under the most severe,
   afflictive dispensations of providence; as also Habakkuk, who
   discovered the strength of his faith in God, as his salvation, even
   when all outward and temporal enjoyments failed him. 2. That there may
   be a continuation of the exercise of this grace; a person may not only
   be able to express his satisfaction as to his interest in Christ once,
   but also to repeat it, as the church does in this song; this is the
   third time she expresses her assurance in this very form of words, and
   oftener still in other language: nay, this grace is often exercised by
   believers, after much sleepiness and drowsiness, many slips and falls,
   great weakness and infirmities, as may he observed in the church's case
   frequently in this book; and it is likewise worthy of remark, that
   those persons who have been the greatest sinners before conversion, and
   have been suffered to fall the foulest after, have been blessed with
   this grace of assurance, as David, Paul, Peter, etc., 3. That the
   exercise of this grace often follows upon the enjoyment of Christ's
   presence; the church had been lately indulged with it; Christ went up
   into his palm-tree, the church, filled her breasts, the ordinances,
   with his grace and presence, and had made her drink of the wine of his
   consolation, which occasioned these expressions of hers. 4. Her
   frequent repetition of these words shows, that much of her comfort
   depended upon the knowledge she had of her interest in Christ; for,
   though assurance is not of the essence of faith, there may be true
   saving faith, where there is not the assurance of faith; yet to have
   it, makes much for the comfort of a believer: for if a glimmering sight
   of Christ fills the soul with so much joy, what must a full view do? if
   only an hope of interest gives much satisfaction, certainly a full
   assurance of it must give much more, 5. It may also be observed, that
   this grace has no tendency to promote or encourage licentiousness: that
   is the sealing word of the Spirit, who performs it as the holy spirit
   of promise; and at the same time he seals, he leaves a greater impress
   of holiness upon the soul: this does not make persons careless,
   indolent, and inactive as to duty; but rather excites and stirs them up
   to be more careful and constant in it; of which here is an instance in
   the church in the following verses; "Come, my beloved, let us go forth
   into the field; let us lodge in the villages," etc.

   2dly, These words may be considered as a modest acknowledgement of the
   church's, that all she was and had were Christ's; "I am my beloved's,"
   and it is "by his grace I am what I am:" all that he had said of her in
   the former verses, she does in this one expression return to him again;
   she acknowledges that all her beauty, which he had so much commended,
   was his, and not her own; that she was by nature black, and only comely
   through that comeliness which he had put upon her; that those several
   graces, with which she was adorned, and which he might have a regard
   unto in the several parts described, were his; he was the object,
   author, owner and preserver of them: that particularly it was owing to
   grace and strength received from him, that her walk, her outward
   conversation, was in any measure agreeable, and was so beautiful as he
   was pleased to declare, in verse 1. That all her fruitfulness, either
   in the exercise of grace, or in the performance of good works, or in
   having many souls born again in the midst of her, which may be intended
   in verse 2 were all from him, and to be referred to his mighty grace
   and divine blessing: That her ministers and ordinances were of his
   providing, appointing and filling, expressed by her breasts, in verse
   3. That all her strength, which appeared in the exercise of her faith
   on him, and in the discharge of her duty to God; her light and
   knowledge in divine truths, the savor and relish which she had of them,
   together with her zeal, courage and magnanimity to keep and defend
   them, signified by her neck, her eyes and nose, in verse 4 were all
   communicated to her from him: as also that he was her only head, both
   of eminence and influence; and that it was owing to that grace, life,
   strength and nourishment, which he afforded, that her hair, true
   believers, grew so well, and appeared so beautiful as they did, in
   verse 5. Moreover, that she was his palm-tree, which he might go up
   into, and gather the fruit of, when he pleased; and that it was his
   grace which caused her to grow so straight and upright, and made her so
   fruitful as she was, in verses 7-9, wherefore she concludes in this
   verse, saying, "I am my beloved's;" that is, the glory of all this is
   to be referred to him, and not to myself.

   3dly, These words may also contain in them a voluntary surrender of
   herself, and all she had, into Christ's hands. This is what he requires
   of us; "my son," says he (Prov. 23:26), "give me thine heart:" but this
   we are unwilling to do, until the day of his power passes upon us; and
   then we are made willing to give ourselves unto the Lord, and all we
   have, that we may therewith serve and glorify his name: This the church
   was enabled to do, knowing that she was not her own, but his; and
   therefore was desirous to glorify him with her body and spirit, which
   were his.

   4thly, They are likewise expressive of that open profession she made of
   Christ before others; she was not ashamed to tell whose she was, and to
   whom she belonged. It is our duty to make a public profession of
   Christ, as well as to believe in his name; "for with the heart man
   believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made
   unto salvation," (Rom. 10:10), a believing in Christ may be sufficient
   for our everlasting security; but a profession of that is necessary
   and. requisite to show forth a Redeemer's glory, which we ought to be
   concerned for; and when we have made a profession of Christ, we ought
   to hold it fast, without wavering, and adorn it by a suitable
   conversation. But,

   II.The church in these words takes notice also of the love and
   affection of Christ towards her; and his desire is towards me. The
   words may be rendered, thus, because or seeing his desire is towards
   me; so Junius reads them; and then they may be considered as a reason
   of the former expression of her faith in Christ, acknowledgment of his
   grace, and profession of his name; for Christ's love manifested to us,
   is a considerable evidence of our interest in him, and in his
   everlasting love; this will make us free and ready to acknowledge that
   we have nothing but what we have received from him; it is this which
   fills us with love to him, constrains us to obey him, encourages us to
   make a profession of him, and to maintain it, notwithstanding all
   discouragements thrown in our way, or opposition made against us. But
   let us consider a little the import of this phrase, and what is
   intended by it: it seems to be very much like, and perhaps the allusion
   is unto those words, in Genesis 3:16, "and thy desire shall be to thy
   husband;" but here the husband's desire is towards his wife; so that
   what was inflicted by way of punishment upon the woman, being inverted,
   is a blessing of grace unto the church. The phrase may be expressive,

   1st, Of Christ's love and affection to his church: his desire was
   towards her, 1. From everlasting; for having loved her, he desired her
   of his Father for his spouse and bride, which was granted him; for God
   gave him his heart's desire in this thing, and did not withhold the
   request of his lips from him. 2. His desire was towards her in time,
   that he might procure everlasting salvation for her; as an instance of
   his love, he undertook it; in the fullness of time assumed her nature,
   in order to effect it; was straitened in his mind, and as it were
   uneasy until it was accomplished; so great was his desire after it:
   hence he expressed himself thus to his disciples, at his eating the
   last passover, "With desire have I desired to eat this passover with
   you before I suffer," (Luke 22:15), the chief reason was, because the
   time was at hand, the hour was now come, so much desired by him, when
   he should give the strongest evidence of his love to his church, in
   laying down his life for her. 3. His desire is towards his people, even
   before conversion, though dead in trespasses and sins; that they may be
   quickened, called by grace, and brought to the knowledge of himself;
   and, notwithstanding all their backslidings and revoltings from him,
   still his desire is after them, to do them good; neither will he turn
   away from them, but rests in his love towards them. 4. His desire is
   continually after his peoples company, grace and beauty; they are the
   excellent in the earth; in whom is all his delight; he is well pleased
   with that beauty which he himself has put upon them, and his desire is
   after it; "so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty," (Ps. 45:11),
   he is ravished with those graces which he has implanted in them; he is
   exceedingly delighted with their looks and words; and therefore says
   (Song 2:14), "let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for
   sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely:" nay, he has
   signified his desire that his church and people may be the place of his
   residence and habitation, and that for ever; "for the Lord hath chosen
   Zion, he hath desired it for his habitation," (Ps. 132:13, 14). Hence,
   5. He will not be satisfied until he has the whole church with him in
   glory; this was the joy that was set before him in his sufferings; what
   he is now making preparation for in heaven, and what he is continually
   pleading for, as being exceedingly desirous of, saying (John 17:24),
   "Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me, may be with me,
   where I am, that they may behold nay glory." Thus Christ's desire is
   towards his church.

   2dly, This phrase may be expressive of that power which the church has
   over Christ, so that she can have any thing of him, when she pleases;
   he is so kind and indulgent an husband, that he will not deny his
   spouse any thing that may be for her good and his glory. The strength
   of faith in prayer is very great; an instance of this we have in Jacob,
   who had power with God, and prevailed: and it is upon this score that
   God said to Moses, let me alone; knowing what interest Moses had in
   him, and how prevalent his petitions w ere with him; so that speaking
   after the manner of men, he could scarcely deny him any thing; "the
   effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much," (James
   5:16).

   3dly, The import of this expression may be, that Christ was her
   husband; "I am my beloved's, and his desire is towards me;" that is, he
   is my husband, I am his, and he is mine: so the wife is called "the
   desire of the eyes," (Ezek. 24:16, 18), and this was a very great
   blessing that she was favored with, and an unspeakable comfort, that
   she could claim her interest in Christ, under this sweet and endearing
   character and relation. Or,

   4thly, It may be expressive of the whole care and concern of Christ for
   her, as her husband; [924] who as such bears and sympathizes with her
   under all her weaknesses and infirmities; protects from all dangers and
   enemies; and provides every thing for her, as food and raiment, grace
   and glory, all things necessary for her, both for time and eternity;
   whatever may conduce to her comfort here, and eternal happiness
   hereafter as a loving husband, he has given himself for her, rescued
   her from slavery and thraldom, procured an inheritance for her; and is
   now preparing that for her, and her for that, and will ere long put her
   into the possession of it. All which manifestly make appear, how much
   his desire has been and is towards her; which she having had some
   knowledge and experience of, ventures to invite him, as in the
   following words, saying.

Chapter 7 Verse 11 & 12

   VERSE 11.

   Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field:
   let us lodge in the villages.

   VERSE 12.

   Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish;
   whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth:
   there will I give thee my loves.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words are,

   I.A general invitation given by the church to Christ, to go along with
   her; "Come, my beloved."

   II.Some particular things mentioned which she invites him to: 1st, "To
   go forth into the field." 2dly, "To lodge in the villages." 3dly, "To
   get up early to the vineyards."

   III.The things she had in view in so doing: 1st. To see whether "the
   vine flourished." 2dly, Whether "the tender grape appeared." 3dly,
   Whether "the pomegranates budded forth."

   IV.A motive which she makes use of to prevail upon him; "there will I
   give thee my loves."

   I.In these words is a general invitation given by the church to Christ
   to go along with her, "Come, my beloved;" on which may be made the
   following remarks: 1. That this word, come, is by the church taken out
   of Christ's mouth it is a word much used by them, not only with
   reference to themselves, but to others also; see chapter 2:10, 13 and
   4:8 (see also Rev. 22:17), and is expressive of much familiarity,
   hearty desire, and tender affection. 2. We must not suppose that Christ
   needed stirring up, or was unwilling to go along with her, but he
   sometimes stays until he is asked: not only to make his church sensible
   of her duty, and that she may prize his presence the more; but also
   because he loves to hear her ask for his company, and say, "come, my
   beloved," let us walk together into the fields; let me there enjoy thy
   company, and let us take our fill of love. 3. These words may be
   considered as the church's calling upon Christ, to make good his
   promise, in verse 8 where he had given her reason to expect his
   presence; "I said I will go up to the palm-tree;" that is, I will grant
   my presence to my church and people, which are comparable to the
   palm-tree; I will be in the midst of them; she now says to him, "come,
   my beloved," do as thou hast said: though none of Christ's promises
   shall ever fail, yet they may not be immediately fulfilled; and it very
   much becomes believers to plead them with him in prayer, and not let
   them lie long by them; they ought to put Christ in remembrance of them,
   as they are allowed, that he would remember to them the word upon which
   he has caused them to hope. 4. They also contain an earnest desire
   after the presence of Christ, and the manifestations of his love unto
   her; nothing is more desirable to believers than Christ's presence; and
   there is a great deal of reason for it; for this only makes their lives
   comfortable whilst here fills them with true solid joy and pleasure,
   makes a heaven upon earth, supports them under all their trials,
   carries them through all their difficulties, and gives them pleasing
   prospects of death and eternity. 5. They show the sense she had of her
   own insufficiency for the work she was going about, without the
   presence of Christ; for without him we can do nothing: hence says Moses
   (Ex. 33:15), "If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence:"
   the church here knew full well that her visiting the several
   congregations of the saints, to see in what condition they were, would
   be to little purpose, unless Christ went with her, and therefore she
   requests the favor of him. 6. It may be farther observed, that the
   clearer views a soul has of its interest in Christ, the more desirous
   it is of communion with him: this may easily be observed in the
   church's case, by comparing these words with the preceding verse: some,
   the more they are known, the less their company is desired; but the
   more and better a soul knows Christ, the more desirable his company is;
   and when they once have it, would never part with it; but say, with
   Peter (Matthew 17:4). "Lord, it is good for us to be here:" hence it is
   that they often long to depart out of this life, that they might be
   with Christ; which to them is far better than this life, and all the
   enjoyments of it. 7. The church's affixing this endearing character,
   "my beloved," to the invitation come, thereby signifying her affection
   to him, as well as her interest in him, may be considered as a powerful
   argument to induce him to go along with her; for with whom should, or
   indeed will loving husbands go, but with their wives and especially
   when their company is importunately desired? one saint cannot tell how
   to deny another, when their company and conversation is desired on
   spiritual accounts; so engaging is it to each other; much less can
   Christ deny his church, when she entreats him after this sort.

   II.The particular things she invites him to, are now to be considered.
   And,

   1st, She desires him to "forth into the field with her:" which may be
   expressive, 1. Of her desire after Christ's presence, both at home and
   abroad; she would not stir out of doors without him; when at home,
   nothing so delightful as his presence; and, having some business in the
   field, she is loth to go without him; O happy soul, that is thus
   blessed! of such an one it may be truly said (Deut. 28:3-6), "Blessed
   shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field;
   blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be
   when thou goest out." 2. Of her desire after solitariness, or of being
   alone with Christ: thus (Gen. 24:63), "Isaac went out to meditate in
   the field;" where he could be retired, and have his thoughts more free,
   composed, and fit for such an employment: the field is also a place of
   more secrecy, as well as retiredness; and therefore (1 Sam. 20:11),
   "Jonathan said to David, come, let us go into the field;" that they
   might more freely tell their minds, and impart their loves to each
   other; thus the church desired Christ to go with her into the field;
   that there being alone with him, she might tell him all her heart, and
   let him know how much she loved him; which she could not so freely do
   in company. 3. She might design some recreation by it; it may be an
   allusion to persons who keep their country-houses, who, being retired
   from the city, take their walks in the fields, to see how the fruits of
   the earth grow, as well as to enjoy the benefit of the country air: so
   the church, she is for going abroad into the fields; but then she would
   have Christ go with her; for no recreation is so, unless he be with
   her; walking abroad in the fields will yield her no pleasure, unless
   Christ be there. 4. It may signify her desire to have the gospel spread
   in the world, especially in those parts of it, in which it had not been
   as yet preached; and which looked very much like an uncultivated field:
   thus the field in the parable (Matthew 13:38), is said to be the world;
   which, being overrun with the thorns and briars of sin and corruption,
   moves her pity and compassion, and excites desire in her to have the
   gospel planted there, that so it might become a fruitful field; and
   therefore she is desirous to have her husband, and the true husbandman,
   go along with her, to manure, cultivate, and plant it; and perhaps the
   Gentile world may be particularly intended.

   2dly, She farther invites him to lodge in the villages with her. There
   is a manifest gradation in these words of hers, which shows her end and
   design in all; she first invites him to go forth into the field with
   her, and that is in order to lodge with her in the villages; and their
   lodging there, is in order to get up early next morning to the
   vineyards; Junius and Tremellius read the words thus, "let us lodge by
   the cyprus-trees;" [925] for the Hebrew word µyrpk cepharim, signifies
   both villages and cyprus-trees; see chapter 1:13 and 4:14, by which may
   be meant the saints; who may be compared thereunto, for their
   excellency, fragrancy, and fruitfulness; and an invitation to lodge by
   or with these, could not be unwelcome to Christ; seeing they are with
   him, "the excellent in the earth, in whom is all his delight:" though
   the word may as well be rendered villages, as it is by the Septuagint
   and others. From whence may be observed, 1. The villages being places
   of mean entertainment, both for food and lodging; that a mean condition
   of life, with Christ, is more eligible and much preferable to the
   greatest affluence of the good things of this world without him: the
   church had rather have hard lodgings in a country village with Christ,
   than to dwell in a city, have her lodgings in a king's palace, or lie
   upon a bed of down without him: as one, [926] once said. "Brown bread
   and the gospel are good fare;" so it may be also said, "A country
   lodging with Christ is good lodging." 2. Villages being places of
   retirement, and free from the noise and hurry of the city, might
   occasion her desire to lodge there; she wanted to be at liberty from
   the world, that she might have some solitary communion with Christ; so
   David, being almost worn out with the fatigues of the camp, the hurries
   of the court, thus passionately wishes, saving (Ps. 55:6, 7), "O! that
   I had wings like a dove, for then would I flee away, and be at rest;
   lo, then would I wander far off, and remain," or as in the Hebrew text,
   "lodge in the wilderness, Selah." The cares of this life, and the
   hurrying employments of it, do much interrupt and break in upon a
   believer's comfortable communion with Christ; and therefore, with the
   church, he desires sometimes to be retired from them, and lodge with
   him in the villages. 3. She desires not only communion with Christ, but
   that it might be continued: she would lodge with him all night, as she
   says, in chapter 1:13, "He shall lie all night betwixt my breasts," it
   is not merely for an hour or two, that she would have his company, but
   all night: believers, who have got some knowledge of Christ's pet son,
   and have tasted the sweetness of communion with him, are like the
   Samaritans (John 4:40), who "besought him that he would tarry with
   them;" they are never weary of his company, and do not care how much
   they have of it. Though, 4. These words may signify her desire to have
   the gospel preached in the villages, as well as in the cities: thus our
   Lord Jesus Christ, in the days of his flesh, "went about all the cities
   and villages, preaching the gospel of the kingdom," (Matthew 9:35), as
   did also his disciples after him; though, as one [927] well observes,
   the gospel was first preached in cities mostly, and from thence spread
   itself in time into the neighboring villages, where the heathen
   idolatry lasted longer than in cities; from whence it had the name of
   paganism, pagus signifying a village; which the church here observing,
   desires Christ to go along with her, and spread the gospel there. [928]

   3dly, She signifies her desire also to get up early to the vineyards:
   for which reason she thought at most proper to lodge in the villages,
   and not in the city; from whence she could not have been so early at
   the vineyards, as she desired to be. By the vineyards, the Targum, R.
   Solomon Jarchi and Alshech understand the synagogues and schools of the
   Jews and so it is explained in the Talmud: [929] though it seems much
   more probable, that by them are meant, the several particular churches
   and congregations of the saints; which are distinguished by sovereign
   grace, planted with a variety of fruitful vines, watered every moment
   by Christ, and fenced about with his almighty power; and by her getting
   up unto them, may be meant her visiting of them; which is much such an
   act of kindness and friendship as that of Paul's, who said to Barnabas
   (Acts 15:36), "Let us go again and visit our brethren, in every city
   where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do." And
   what still more shows how intent she was upon it, and how much her
   heart was in it, she is for getting up early; that is, betimes in the
   morning, or in the most seasonable time, as the word early is sometimes
   used: she is for losing no opportunity, and making use of the most
   suitable one to visit the churches; and that her visit may not be in
   vain, she is for taking Christ along with her; she is not willing to go
   alone; she knew of what service Christ's presence would be to the
   churches, and to what little purpose hers would be without him; and
   therefore she says, "let us get up early," etc. But,

   III.She mentions the several things she had in view in giving this
   invitation to Christ, or the several ends of it. And,

   1st, It was to "see if the vine flourished;" and she might well think
   that this and what follows would take with Christ, and go a great way
   to prevail upon him to go along with her; seeing her ends here are much
   the same with his in going down into his nut-garden, chapter 6:11, and
   which, no doubt, she had some reference to. By the vine, the Targum
   understands the Israelites, who may be compared thereunto; and I think,
   true believers in Christ, who are Israelites indeed, may very well be
   meant. These indeed, likes vines, are weak and worthless creatures of
   themselves: yet being engrafted in Christ, the true vine, and growing
   upon him, they bring forth fruit, and are exceeding valuable and
   precious: and by their flourishing may be meant, both their
   fruitfulness in the exercise of grace, and in the performance of good
   works: and though the believer is not always in a flourishing
   condition; there is sometimes but a small appearance of fruit upon him;
   his life, his grace is hid unto him; and his fruitfulness does not
   appear to others; yet he shall flourish again, because he is planted in
   a fruitful soil, by the rivers of divine love and grace; is well rooted
   in Christ Jesus, and whom he takes care of, waters every moment, and
   purges and prunes, that he may bring forth more fruit; this the church
   was sensible of, and therefore is desirous that Christ would go along
   with her.

   2dly, Another end she had in inviting Christ to, go with her into the
   field, villages and vineyards, is, to see "whether the tender grape
   appear, or whether the flower of the grape opened itself." [930] By
   which may be meant young converts; who are weak and tender, have but
   little knowledge, a small degree of faith, and have not arrived to that
   solidity and establishment, as many others have; and are therefore
   compared to newborn babes, lambs, and kids of the flock: as also to a
   bruised reed, and to the smoking flax; but as Christ does not despise
   the day of small things, so neither does the church overlook them, but
   shows a very great concern for them; she is very desirous of seeing
   these appear in churches: this is a very great encouragement to
   churches, when souls are born again among them; it is a sign that the
   Lord designs to continue them, and to make them yet more flourishing
   and fruitful.

   3dly, Her other end is to see whether "the pomegranates budded." By
   pomegranates, may be meant stronger believers, who are taller and more
   fruitful than the former; why they are so compared, may be seen in
   chap. 4:13, and by the braidings of them, may be meant the actings and
   exercise of grace in them. We may observe that the church is concerned
   for the comfortable well-being and good estate of believers of all
   ranks and sizes; of the vines and pomegranates, as well as of the
   tender grapes; and of the buddings of the one, as well as of the
   blossoming or opening of the other.

   IV.The motive which she makes use of to prevail upon Christ to comply
   with her invitation, is, "for there will I give thee my loves;" that
   is, when we are alone in the field, or at our lodgings in the villages,
   or when we are together in the vineyards, visiting the vines and
   pomegranates, I will show thee my love; I will open all my heart to
   thee, and thou shalt know how much I love thee. And, 1. We are not to
   suppose that this is the first time of her loving Christ, or of her
   manifesting it to him, for she loved him long before; but she mentions
   this now to gain her end; for she knew very well what would take with
   Christ's heart, what was grateful to him, and that nothing was more so
   than expressions of her love to him, and this she had learned from his
   own words, in chapter 4:10, "How fair is thy love, my sister, my
   spouse! how much better is thy love than wine!" Christ knew very well
   she loved him; but yet he loved to hear her say she did. What made
   Christ ask Peter so often whether he loved him or no? it was not
   because he doubted of it, but because he loved to hear him express it.
   2. By her loves, may be meant the manifestations of her love to him, in
   the observance of his commands; the offering up the sacrifices of
   prayer and praise unto him; as well as all other branches of religious
   worship and service in his house, which she promises to him there; and
   this sense the Targum inclines unto. 3. This, being expressed in the
   plural number, may intend not only the excellency of her love to
   Christ, and the various ways of manifesting it to him, but also the
   abundance of it: here was an overflow of it in her soul; her heart was
   brimful of it, and she seems to want an opportunity of venting it; for
   which purpose she desires to be alone with Christ, as Joseph did with
   his brethren, that so she might, with the greater freedom, let out her
   affections to him. 4. Communion with Christ, and the flourishing
   condition of his churches, tend much to enlarge a believer's heart with
   love to Christ, and to draw out his affections towards him, "we love
   him, because he first loved us," 1 John 4:19, I see not why the word
   for loves, may not be rendered, my lovely flowers; as a word nearly the
   same, in the following verse, is by some rendered, "those lovely
   flowers give a good smell, as Junius and Tremellius;" which seem to
   refer to the flowers here; such as were to be met with in plenty in
   fields and vineyards, and among vines and pomegranates, as lilies,
   violets, etc. and may be an allusion to lovers, who used to give to
   those they loved, sweet smelling flowers; [931] and here may signify
   the graces of the Spirit, and the actings of them, which are fragrant
   and acceptable to Christ.

Chapter 7 Verse 13

   The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant
   fruits,
   new and old; which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words the church makes use of another motive or
   argument to prevail upon Christ to grant her his presence and company,
   taken from the variety of fragrant flowers and pleasant fruits, which
   she abounded with, and had ready at hand, and which she had carefully
   laid up and reserved for his use and service; all which are commended,

   I.From the fragrancy of them; "the mandrakes give a smell."

   II.From the comprehensiveness of them; "all manner of pleasant fruits."

   III.These are said to be "new and old."

   IV.Not afar off, but at the very door; "at our gates."

   V.They are all for his use and service; "which I have laid up for thee,
   O my beloved."

   I.The fragrancy of those flowers or fruits with which she abounds, is
   here expressed; "the mandrakes give a smell." The Hebrew word µyawdd
   dudaim, translated mandrakes, is only found in this place, and in
   Genesis 30:14-16, in this sense; but what plant or herb is intended by
   it, is not very easy to determine: Junius and Tremellius have rendered
   it, in both places, by "flores amabiles, lovely flowers;" which they
   think best agrees with the etymology of the word: others [932] render
   it, Jessamin; others, [933] lilies; others, violets: R. Solomon Jarchi
   would have it rendered baskets here, and refers to Jeremiah 24:1, where
   the people of Israel are represented by two baskets of figs; where a
   word derived from the same root, and of the same form is used; and that
   both sorts of people, there represented, may be here said to give a
   good smell, because now they all sought the face of the Lord.
   Ludolphus, in his Ethiopic history, [934] takes it to be the fruit
   which the Arabians call mauz or muza, (called, by some, the Indian fig)
   which, in the Abyssine country, is as big as a cucumber, and of the
   same form and shape; fifty of which grow upon one and the same stalk,
   and are of a very sweet taste and smell; from which cognation of a
   great many upon the same stalk, he thinks it took the name of dudaim.
   Some think, the fruit of the lote-tree is here intended; which,
   according to Homer, [935] Herodotus, [936] Ovid, [937] and others,
   [938] was a very sweet and delicious fruit; sweet apples, as some call
   them: there were a people in Africa, called Lotophagi, who lived upon
   it, as observed by the same authors: the mandrake of the Chinese is the
   famous root they call ginseng; which, with them, is a sovereign remedy
   for all weaknesses of body or mind; a preservative of health; and they
   call it the plant that gives immortality. Ravius, in his dissertation
   concerning the dudaim, thinks the words should be rendered, "the
   branches put forth their sweet-smelling flowers;" and that the branches
   of fig-trees are meant, which give a good smell, agreeable to chapter
   2:13, and which, he supposes, to be the use of the word, in Jeremiah
   24:1, and to his sense Heidegger [939] agrees; only he thinks the word
   branches, is not to be restrained to a particular species, but may
   signify branches of sweet-smelling flowers and fruits in general. But
   the generality of Translators and Interpreters render it, mandrakes; as
   do the Septuagint, both the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, on Genesis
   30:14, though the Targum on this place renders it, balsam: but then it
   is questionable whether the same plant, which is known among us by the
   name of mandrakes, is here meant, because of its strong smell; but of
   this more hereafter. Let us consider what may be intended hereby. And,

   1st, By these mandrakes may be meant, the saints and people of God; who
   are plants of God's right hand planting, are both fragrant and
   fruitful; and may be compared unto them, 1. Because the mandrake is a
   cold plant, and therefore used for the assuaging inflammations, and
   healing ulcers: [940] the people of God, though they ought not to be
   cold in divine things, nor lukewarm in the cause of Christ, and
   vindication of his truths and ordinances; vet are, or at least should
   be, of cooling spirits, to allay those heats, and heal those divisions
   which too often appear in the churches of Christ; which they may be
   instrumental in, by a prudent carriage, a moderate temper, and by using
   soft and "pleasant words;" which, as Solomon says (Prov. 15:1, 16:24),
   "turn away wrath" and are "sweet to the soul, and health to the bones:"
   and when they appear to be of hot and fiery tempers and dispositions,
   it is what is opposite to the principle which is wrought in them and
   that profession which they make. 2. Because the mandrake is supposed to
   excite love; hence the apples of it are called "apples of love;" and
   the Hebrew word here used comes from a root which signifies love: the
   saints may well be represented by them on this account; for they do not
   provoke Christ to love them, by the love they show him, or the
   obedience they perform unto him; yet these often draw out Christ's
   affections to them; and what he himself has wrought in them, and put
   upon them, render them lovely in his eye; besides, it is their
   incumbent duty, and should be the great employment of their lives, to
   provoke one another "to love and good works." 3. They have been also
   thought to help barrenness, [941] and to make fruitful; which some have
   imagined to be the reason of that great contention between Rachel and
   Leah concerning them; and the same opinion of their prolific virtue
   remains in those eastern parts still, and they are applied for that
   purpose; and the plant is described as having a large leaf, bearing a
   certain sort of fruit, in shape resembling an apple, growing ripe in
   harvest, but of an ill savor, and not wholesome: [942] hence the phrase
   here may intend the fruitfulness of the church in the first times of
   the gospel, through the vast numbers of souls which were born again
   therein, when that prophecy was fulfilled (Isa. 54:1), "Sing, O barren,
   thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou
   that didst not travail with child; for more are the children of the
   desolate, than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord:" which
   fruitfulness of the church may be considered as a very good argument
   used by her here, to prevail on Christ to grant her his presence and
   company. 4. The mandrake is a narcotic, has a sleepy virtue in it, as
   Pliny [943] observes, and much inclines thereunto; Levinus Lemnius
   [944] writes of himself, that being in his study, he was suddenly taken
   with a sleepy fit, which he could by no means account for, until he
   espied a mandrake-apple upon one of the shelves, to which he ascribed
   it; and Plutarch [945] relates, that mandrakes, which grow by vines,
   give the wine made of them such a virtue, that those who drink of it
   sleep mope sweetly: the saints are often in sleepy frames themselves;
   the wise virgins slept as well as the foolish; and conversation with
   sleepy professors makes others so likewise. 5. It not only inclines to
   sleep, but makes persons sluggish and slothful; hence those phrases,
   "to drink the mendrake, and to sleep under a mandrake," [946] are
   proverbially used of persons who are sluggish and inactive in the
   discharge of their office: the saints are too often so themselves, and
   the cause thereof in others; being "slothful in business, and not
   fervent in spirit, serving the Lord," as they ought to be. 6. The
   apples of the mandrake are very delightful to look upon, being of a
   yellow or golden color; and so are the saints in Christ's eye; to them
   he looks, and with them he is well pleased, they being beautified with
   the garments of his salvation, and adorned with the graces of his
   Spirit. 7. These mandrakes are said to "give a smell:" it is true, it
   is not said that they give a good smell; but it may be reasonably
   supposed that such an one is intended, because their commendation is
   designed; and they are taken notice of by the church, as what might be
   inviting to Christ; and so no doubt Reuben's mandrakes, which Rachel
   took such a fancy to, were fragrant, and of a sweet smell; or we may
   reasonably suppose the boy would not have gathered them, nor Rachel
   have took such a liking to them, no more than Leah would have contended
   with her about them, unless it was for a reason before given. But then
   the difficulty is to know what plant is intended, seeing our present
   mandrakes are of an ill and offensive smell; and so is the plant now
   shewn for it, as before observed; and such an account also Pliny [947]
   gives of it; though Dioscorides, Levinus Lemnius [948] and Augustine,
   [949] who says, he saw the plant, and examined it, say, that it is of a
   very sweet smell; which though it does not agree with the plant which
   now bears the name, suits well with that intended here; for which
   reason the saints may be compared unto it, whose persons are of a sweet
   smell, being clothed with Christ's garments, which "smell of myrrh,
   aloes and cassia," and anointed with the savory ointments of the
   Spirit's grace; whose prayers are so, being perfumed with Christ's
   mediation; and their good works being accepted, with their persons, "in
   the beloved:" so the Jews [950] interpret the mandrakes, of the young
   men of Israel; who have not tasted the taste of sin, pure and. holy
   persons, free from vicious habits. Or,

   2dly, By these mandrakes, which give a good smell, may be meant the
   doctrines and promises of the gospel; which, 1. Like mandrakes, are of
   a healing and cooling nature: the law is a fiery law; and when it
   works, in a sinner's conscience, it makes fiery work there; it worketh
   wrath, which is only assuaged through the application of gospel
   doctrines and promises, by the blessed Spirit. 2. Like mandrakes, these
   excite love; for though it is the law which enjoins and requires love
   both to God and to our neighbor; yet it is the gospel which moves and
   presses us to it, with the noblest motives and most powerful arguments;
   such as those which are taken from the love of God and Christ to us. 3.
   Like mandrakes; are the means of fruitfulness: it is by the gospel, as
   the instrumental means, that souls are begotten again to Christ; for
   though they are born of an incorruptible seed, and are begotten again
   according to the sovereign will of God, and as an instance of his
   abundant mercy, yet it is by the word of truth, which liveth and
   abideth for ever; 4. As the mandrake apples are delightful, so are the
   doctrines and promises of the gospel; which words being "fitly spoken,
   are like apples of gold in pictures of silver." 5. As the mandrakes
   give a good smell, so do these; for to them that are saved, they are
   "the savor of life unto life."

   3dly, By these dudaim or lovely flowers, as Junius translates the word,
   may be meant the graces of the Spirit; such as faith, repentance, love,
   thankfulness, hope, humility, etc. 1. Faith may be one of those lovely
   flowers which give a good smell: this is a flower that does not grow in
   nature's garden; bat is sown and raised in the Believer's heart, by the
   power and Spirit of God; which at first is but like a grain of
   mustard-seed, that is the least of all seeds; but afterwards grows in
   some more, is others less; but in all it is "alike precious faith,"
   which emits a sweet fragrancy to God and Christ. 2. Repentance may be
   another of those lovely flowers; this grows in the same garden as faith
   does; they are sown and raised up together, and that by one and the
   same hand; and when attended with fruits becoming it, is highly valued
   by Christ Jesus. 3. Love may be another of those lovely flowers; this
   precious flower springs from, is raised up and influenced by, as well
   as scented with the love of Christ: and of all the flowers in the
   believer's garden, none is fairer in Christ's eye, or gives trim, with
   its smell, more pleasure and delight; for of this he says, in chapter
   4:10, "How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! etc.," 4. The grace
   of thankfulness is another of these flowers; nay, a certain Expositor
   [951] thinks, that it is chiefly intended: the exercise of this grace
   is required of us, far every mercy, both spiritual and temporal; and in
   every condition, state, and circumstance of life: this is more pleasing
   to God; and he smells a sweeter savor of rest in it, than in all
   burnt-offerings; and a contrary disposition is highly, resented by him,
   as appears from the case of the ten lepers that were cleansed, of which
   but one returned to give God thanks. 5. The grace of hope may be
   another of those lovely flowers: this is none of the meanest flowers
   which grow in the believer's garden; this is raised by powerful
   efficacious grace; is watered with divine love; is made to abound
   through the power of the Holy Ghost; and in which Christ takes no small
   pleasure and delight "for the Lord takes pleasure in them that fear
   him, in those that hope in his mercy." 6. The grace of humility is
   another precious flower; "the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit is in
   the sight of God of great price:" this grace so much adorns believers,
   that Christ says, "to this man will I look, that is poor and of a
   contrite spirit;" neither can he take his eye off them, nor will he
   remove from them, but dwell with them for evermore. I might have
   mentioned many more of those lovely and sweet-smelling flowers, as
   patience, self-denial, etc, but these may suffice.

   II.The church's fruits are commended from the comprehensiveness of
   them; she is possessed of "all manner of pleasant fruits." Which may
   denote, 1. The plenty of them: believers have not only abundance of
   grace in Christ,, but also abundance in themselves; for "where sin
   abounded, grace does much more abound;" they have also a fullness of
   all spiritual blessings in Christ, as well as a plenty of
   gospel-doctrines, and exceeding great and precious promises. 2. This
   may likewise denote the variety of them: the graces of the Spirit are
   many and various; as are the blessings of the gospel, such as
   redemption through Christ's blood, pardon of sin, justification by his
   righteousness, adoption, sanctification, etc. so are the doctrines and
   promises of the gospel, which are all suited to the several cases and
   circumstances of believers. 3. It also denotes the excellency of them;
   for here are not only plenty and variety of all manner of fruits, but
   all manner of pleasant fruits; such as do not grow every where, nor in
   any garden, but only in the garden of the church; whose "plants are an
   orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits, etc." The allusion, no
   doubt, is to the most excellent fruits, with which the land of Judea
   abounded, as apples, figs, dates, pomegranates, etc. the word used
   includes every precious thing; not fruits only, but gold, silver,
   jewels, garments, etc. [952]

   III.These fruits are said to be both new and old, which still heightens
   and increases the commendation of them; there is such plenty and
   fullness of them, as that the former year's produce is not gone, when
   the new is gathered in; here is some of both years increase, which is
   an indication of great plenty, as well as of the goodness of the fruit
   that will keep so long. By these fruits new and old, 1. Some [953]
   understand the gifts of the Spirit; which Christ, after his ascension,
   received for his church, and bestowed on it; together with those
   temporal blessings which she enjoyed before. Though, 2. Others think
   that by them are intended moral and natural virtues, which may be found
   in an unconverted man; and the graces of the Spirit, which are only in
   renewed souls. But, 3. It seems much better to understand them of those
   fresh supplies of grace which believers have from Christ; for they
   cannot live upon their old stock, but must have a new supply; which
   they are graciously indulged with from Christ, from whose fullness they
   continually "receive grace for grace." Though, 4. I am rather inclined
   to think, that the doctrines of the Old and New Testament, which, for
   matter and substance are one and the same, are here meant with which;
   the church, and particularly her scribes and faithful ministers are
   furnished, so as they can "bring forth out of their treasure things new
   and old," (Matthew 13:52).

   IV.These fruits are also said to be at their gates; which is mentioned,
   1. In opposition to the mandrakes which grew in the field; which
   appears to be a field-plant, from Genesis 30:14, where it is said, that
   "Reuben went in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the
   field;" but these fruits here grew at their very doors. 2. It may be an
   allusion to a custom of the eastern countries, in garnishing the doors
   of new-married persons with fruits and flowers; and not only at nuptial
   feasts, but at other festivals also; [954] which made it very inviting
   to go within. 3. It may also signify, that these fruits were near at
   hand; there was no occasion to go far for them; they were even at the
   door, as the judge is said to be (James 5:9), 4. It may denote the
   publicness of them: they are not hid in secret, but exposed to public
   view; as the graces and good works of the saints should be; " Let your
   light," says our Lord (Matthew 5:16), "shine before men," etc. as well
   as the doctrines of the gospel, which are not to be spoken in a corner,
   but to be divulged upon the house-top. 5. By these gates may be meant,
   the means and ordinances of the gospel, where those fruits may be had;
   and it is therefore an encouragement to souls to "watch daily at
   wisdom's gates, waiting at the posts of her door:" so some Jewish [955]
   writers interpret them of their synagogues and schools.

   V.All this plenty and variety of pleasant fruits which were just at
   hand, the church declares were all laid up for Christ; "which I have
   laid up for thee, O my beloved:" respect may be had to a custom with
   lovers, to lay up fruits for those they love; at least such a custom
   may be compared with this. [956] Christ had bestowed a large store and
   great plenty of fruit upon the church, which she had carefully reserved
   for him; she laid it up in her heart; she bore it in remembrance, which
   this phrase is sometimes expressive of: thus it is said (Luke 1:66),
   that all that heard of the surprising circumstances which attended the
   birth of John the Baptist, "laid them up in their hearts," that is,
   bore them in remembrance; so should we lay up the word of God, and the
   doctrines of it in our minds, and not forget them: thus David said (Ps.
   119:11), he did "Thy word," says he, "have I hid or laid up," it is the
   same word that is here used, "in mine heart, that I might not sin
   against thee:" so likewise should we treasure up in our minds all the
   instances of God's grace and favor to us, and record the several
   experiences of his loving kindness; not as a stock to live upon, but to
   be brought out at proper times, to magnify the grace of Christ and to
   advance his glory; "for of him, and through him, and to him, are all
   things." Now this appears to be a very great attainment and. a mighty
   instance of grace in the church, to have a stock of promises and
   experiences, and yet not live upon them herself, but upon Christ the
   author and donor of them; to lay them up for his service, and lay them
   out for his honor and glory: and her adding this endearing character,
   "O my beloved," shows not only the strength of her affection to him,
   but may also serve to assure him of the truth of what she said; as well
   as be an inducement to him to comply with her request, which she
   passionately renews in the beginning of the next chapter.

   Chapter 8
     __________________________________________________________________

   This chapter begins with an ardent wish of the church, for a free and
   intimate converse with Christ; declaring what she would do to him. and,
   for him, should she have an interview with him, verse 1. 2. what
   familiarity should be between them, verse 3, charging the daughters of
   Jerusalem not to give him any disturbance, verse 4. Upon which they
   inquire who she was, that was in such a posture as they saw her in,
   verse 5, when the church, instead of giving them an answer, says some
   things concerning her beloved, on whom they saw her leaning; and makes
   some requests to him, for more nearness to him, and manifestations of
   his love to her; urged from the strength of her love and affections to
   him, which were invincible, Song of Solomon 5:6,7. Next follows a
   speech of the church about her little sister: expressing a concern for
   her, and what she would do to her, and with her, verse 8,9, and the
   answer of the little sister, declaring what she was, and what she
   enjoyed, verse 10, then the words of the church again, concerning her
   husband's vineyard, the place, keepers, and profits of it, verse 11,
   12. And the chapter, and with it the Song, is concluded with a request
   of Christ to the church, that he might hear her voice, verse 13, and
   with a petition of hers to him, that he would come quickly to her,
   verse 14.

     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words are a continuation, or rather a renewal of the
   church's desire after communion with Christ; they contain these three
   things:

   I.An ardent wish for a free and familiar converse with Christ; that he
   would show himself to her as her brother, and act the part of one unto
   her; "O that thou weft as my brother:" and her meaning herein is more
   strongly expressed, by adding, "that sucked the breasts of my mother."

   II.A resolution of hers to kiss him when she found him without; "when I
   should find thee without, I would kiss thee."

   III.The opinion which she entertained, that she should not be despised
   for such an action; "yea, I should not be despised."

   I.These words contain an hearty wish of the church's: the words may be
   read thus, "Who will give thee as a brother to me?" [957] Such forms of
   wishing may be seen in many places (see Isa. 14:7; Job 23:2), and the
   meaning is, that Christ would show himself to her in the relation of a
   brother; act the part of one towards her; and that she might as freely
   converse with him, as a brother and sister may and use to do. Several
   Jewish [958] writers acknowledge, that the King Messiah is intended by
   the brother here: in what sense Christ stands in such a relation to his
   church and to all true believers; as also what this wish of hers is
   expressive of, I shall now consider. And, 1. Christ is the Church's
   brother by virtue of his incarnation, or the assumption of her nature;
   they are nearly allied in the bonds of consanguinity; he is of the same
   flesh and blood with her; and she is flesh of his flesh, and bone of
   his bone; there is a very great nearness, affinity and likeness Between
   them, for "in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his
   brethren;" and it is upon this score that he becomes a brother to them;
   the words may be considered as the wish of the old church for Christ's
   incarnation. 2. Christ and believers are of one and the same Father:
   God is the Father of Christ, and so he is of all his covenant-people;
   of whom he says (2 Cor. 6:18). "I will be a Father unto you, and ye
   shall be my sons and daughters;" which is an instance of his boundless
   and amazing grace: hence because Christ and believers are sons of the
   same father, though not in the same way of dilation, he bid Mary
   Magdalene go to his brethren: and as an evidence of their standing in
   that relation to him, say unto them, John 20:17, "I ascend unto my
   father and your father, and to my God and your God:" it is also upon
   this account that saints become "heirs of God, and joint heirs with
   Christ;" they are heirs of God, because his children; and joint heirs
   with Christ, because they are his brethren, he being the firstborn
   among them. 3. Persons may be said to be brethren, by being concerned
   in one and the same covenant: thus there was a brotherhood between
   Judah and Israel, which was dissolved by God's breaking his covenant
   with them (Zech. 11:10, 14). Christ and his people are in one and the
   same covenant, and in such an one as can never be broken; though as he
   has the preeminence in all things, as he ought to have, so he has in
   this; for he is the mediator, surety, and messenger of the covenant;
   nay he is the covenant itself; he is the foundation on which it stands,
   and the matter of which it consists; he is the saints representative in
   it; and because it is made with him, their elder brother, in their
   name, room and stead, therefore it is said to be made with them, and
   they share in all the blessings and comforts of it, 4. Persons that are
   of like nature, temper, dispositions and practices, are said to be
   brethren: thus Simeon and Levi are said Genesis 49:5, to be brethren;
   not because of their natural relation, but because of their agreement
   in their tempers and practices: Christ and believers are brethren in
   this sense; they are much of the same nature; Christ has assumed their
   nature, and they are in some measure made partakers of his; principles
   of grace and holiness from him are wrought in them; nay, he is formed
   in their hearts; his image is enstamped, and his features are drawn
   there; there is a very great likeness between them; they are conformed
   to the image of him who is the first-born among many brethren; hence it
   is said (Heb. 2:11), that "he that sanctifieth, and they that are
   sanctified, are all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call
   them brethren;" and to the same purpose those words of Christ might be
   produced, in Matthew 12:50, "for whosoever shall do the will of my
   father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and
   mother." 3. Those who are partners and companions in afflictions, may
   be also called brethren; hence Job says, chapter 30:29, on the account
   of his sorrowful and afflicted condition, that he was a "brother to
   dragons, and a companion to owls:" Christ and believers are brethren in
   sufferings; though it is true, they were not companions with him in his
   sufferings, yet he is in theirs the afflictions of the churches are the
   afflictions of Christ; he bears the heaviest part of them: for what is
   done to his people he takes as done to himself; and as they suffer with
   him, so they shall reign with him hereafter in glory, and that for
   ever. 6. Persons may be called brethren on the score of friendship:
   thus David, in 2 Samuel 1:26, calls Jonathan his brother; not so much
   because he had married his sister, but on the account of the mutual
   friendship that had been between them: in this sense Christ and
   believers are brethren; he is a friend to them, and such a "friend that
   sticks closer than a brother;" of which friendship of his towards them,
   he has given many open and undeniable proofs; he accounts them as his
   friends, and therefore treats them as such, by frequent visiting of
   them, disclosing of his secret's to them, and making noble
   entertainments for them. 7. The church might wish that Christ would
   manifest himself to her, under this relation of a brother, because of
   that intimacy, freedom and familiarity, which she might use with him as
   such; she would kiss him in the open street, take him by the hand, and
   lead him into her mother's house, and there keep a free conversation
   with him; as a sister might do with an own brother, and not be
   reproached for it. 8. Her meaning also may be, that he would act the
   part of a brother to her that is, that he would be pitiful and
   compassionate to her, and sympathize with her under all her exercises,
   as a tender-hearted brother would; and such an one is Christ; he has a
   fellow-feeling with his people in all their temptations, and gives them
   all needful succor and relief; in all their afflictions he is
   afflicted, and has bowels of compassion for them in all their
   distresses. 9. A brother not only sympathizes with, but condescends to
   the weaknesses and infirmities of his brethren, it is a wonderful
   condescension in Christ to stand in this relation to his people, as
   also not to be ashamed to own it; and being in it, he is capable of
   showing a great deal of condescension to them in many instances; which
   the superiority of a father, in which relation he also stands, would
   not admit of; to which the church might have regard in this wish of
   hers. 10. The love and affection of a brother is very great, and much
   to be valued, as Christ's is by the church; for "his loving-kindness is
   better than life," and all the comforts of it; the manifestations of
   which the church may well be supposed to desire here, as she did in
   chapter 1:2, where she says, and what is much the same with this
   request here; "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for thy
   love is better than wine."

   Again, the church's meaning, in this ardent and pathetic wish of hers,
   is more strongly expressed by adding, that it was such a brother she
   wished for, "that sucked the breasts of her mother;" in which may be
   considered, 1st, What this phrase in general intends. 2dly, Who is
   meant by her mother. 3dly, What by sucking of her mother's breasts.

   1st, This phrase in general may intend either, 1. The truth of Christ's
   human nature; she wishes for his incarnation in the former phrase, and
   in this, that it might appear to be true and real; of which his
   conception and birth, his being the child born, and the infant of days,
   his eating butter and honey, and sucking the breasts of his mother,
   were sufficient indications. Or, 2. The near relation Christ stands in
   to his church, being a brother by the mother's side; which relation is
   accounted the nearest, and the affection of such an one is also the
   strongest; of which we have an instance in the case of Joseph, to whom
   Reuben, Judah, Simeon, etc., were brethren, though only by his father's
   side; and to whom he had a brotherly love, but not so strong an
   affection as he had to Benjamin, his mother's son; who was such a
   brother that had sucked the breasts of his mother, as may be seen in
   Genesis 43:29, 30, 34, such a brother, so nearly related, and of such
   an affection, the church wisheth for.

   2dly, It may also be inquired who is meant by her mother: and this may
   be, either the church, who may be called so, on the account of the many
   converts which are born in her: thus Zion is said to travail in birth,
   and bring forth children (Isa. 66:8), and the Gentile church is said to
   be the mother of many (Isa. 54:1), and regenerate souls are Frequently
   called the church's children, in that prophecy: or else, by her mother,
   we are to understand the covenant of graces "the Jerusalem which is
   above, which is the mother of us all," (Gal. 4:26), for every converted
   soul is the birth of an everlasting covenant; hence such are called, in
   Romans 9:8, the children of the promise; and it is no unusual phrase
   with the Jews, to call themselves the children of the covenant.

   3dly, By sucking the breasts of her mother, may be meant, either, 1.
   The enjoyment of the grace and blessings of the everlasting covenant;
   so this phrase of sucking the breasts is used for the enjoyment of
   blessings (Isa. 60:16), and in this sense Christ may be truly said to
   suck the breasts of her mother; for all grace is in his hands; every
   blessing of the covenant he is in possession of; we have all our grace
   from him, and are blessed with all spiritual blessings only in him. Or
   else, 2. By these breasts may be meant the word and ordinances; which
   are breasts of consolation to believers, in whose hearts Christ is
   formed; so that when they suck the breasts, and are nourished with the
   sincere milk of the word, and grow thereby, Christ may be said to suck
   of them, and be nourished by them. Or else, 3. This phrase may be
   expressive of that familiar intercourse and delightful communion which
   is between Christ and his church; which is frequently expressed by
   eating, feasting, and supping together (see chapter 5:1 and Rev. 3:20).

   II. The next thing in the words, is the church's resolution to kiss
   Christ, whenever she found him without: in which may be observed, 1st,
   The resolution itself, to kiss him. 2dly, The time when she would put
   this into practice, "when I should find thee." 3dly, The place where
   she would do this, and that is, without.

   1st, We may consider the resolution itself, which is to kiss him; which
   is no other than what was her duty to do, and what is enjoined all
   believers; Psalm 2:12. "Kiss the son, lest he be angry." Which may be
   understood these several ways: 1. There is a kiss of approbation; in
   this sense the word is used (Prov. 24:26), "Every man shall kiss his
   lips, that giveth a right answer;" that is, shall approve his sayings,
   and highly extol and commend him for them: Christ is a person to be
   liked and approved, being "altogether lovely, and the chiefest among
   tea thousands;" and so he is by every believer there is none in heaven
   or earth, that is so much valued by them as he is; they count all
   things but loss and dung, in comparison of him; they approve of him as
   their surety and savior, and esteem him in every character and relation
   he stands in to them. 2. There is a kiss of love and affection, which
   is used by friends and relations, and that either at meeting or parting
   thus the prodigal's father fell on his neck and kissed him, when he met
   him; as did Paul's friends, at parting with him; which kiss of charity,
   or love, was much used among the primitive saints; and with such a kiss
   as this, the church kisses Christ, whom she dearly loves, and has the
   strongest affection for, arising from his love and loveliness: as
   Christ's kisses, in chapter 1:2, are the lettings out and
   manifestations of his love to the church; so the church's lips are the
   lettings forth and manifestations of her love to him: with such a kiss
   as this, the poor woman kissed Christ, in Luke 7:38, who "began to wash
   his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and
   kissed his feet, and anointed them with ointment; for she loved much,"
   much being forgiven her. 3. There is also a kiss of faith and
   dependence; and then may souls be said to kiss Christ, when they, as
   perishing creatures, come and venture their all upon him, give up
   themselves to him, resolving to have no other savior but him; when they
   can roll themselves on him, relying on his grace, trusting to his
   righteousness, when, whilst they are coming out of the wilderness, are
   leaning upon their beloved; and more especially when they embrace him
   in the arms of faith, and say, with Thomas, My Lord, and my God. 4.
   There is a kiss of homage and subjection; so kissing the king's hand,
   as it is an instance of his grace and favor to his subjects to permit
   them to do it, so it is a token of their subjection to him; thus Samuel
   anointed Saul, and kissed him (1 Sam. 10:1), which former act was a
   declaring him king, the latter an instance of his subjection to him:
   thus souls may be said to kiss Christ, when they acknowledge him to be
   their Lord and King, and submit to his laws and ordinances refusing
   subjection to sin, Satan, and the world. 5. There is a kiss of worship
   and adoration: the custom of kissing idols very early prevailed among
   idolatrous people; thus Baal's worshippers kissed him (1 Kings 19:18),
   as did also the worshippers of Jeroboam's calves (Hoses 13:2), so
   kissing the hand at the sight of the sun or moon, was esteemed an act
   of adoration of them in Job's time, chapter 31:26, 27, in the same
   sense it may be used here; for as Christ is the believer's Lord, he
   ought to worship him; and that not with a mere civil worship, which may
   be given to creatures, but with that religious adoration which ought to
   be given to the most high God; for "all men should honor the son, as
   they honor the father." When therefore the church or any believer
   signify their love and liking to Christ, exercise faith upon him,
   subject themselves unto him, and give him all due worship and
   adoration, as well as make an open profession of him, then may they be
   said to kiss him. But,

   2dly, She declares the time when she would do this; and that is when
   she found him: From whence may be observed, 1. That Christ may be
   sometimes absent from his church and people, which is a very great
   affliction to them. 2. That they cannot be easy without him, but will
   be earnestly desirous of his company, and seek for him until they find
   him, as may be learned from the case of the church, in chapter 3:1-3.
   3. That finding Christ, is the comfortable enjoyment of his presence;
   it is the soul's having nearness to him, and sensible communion with
   him; which is the time that they can come so near to him as to kiss
   him.

   3dly, The place where she would do this, and that is, without: by which
   may be meant, either, 1. The Gentile world, which was without the land
   of Judea; the inhabitants of which are said to be "without, afar off
   aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of
   promise, and without hope, and God and Christ in the world;" so that it
   may be expressive of her desire to find Christ in the Gentile world,
   and how much her love and affections would be drawn oat to him on that
   account. Or, 2. By without, or in the street, [959] as it may be
   rendered, may be meant the public ordinances, where wisdom cries (Prov.
   1:20), and where the church sought Christ, chapter 3:2, and where
   finding him, she owns him, gives him homage and adoration, and lets out
   her affection to him. Or, 3. It may point out the way, and manner in
   which she sought him, as well as the place where, which was by going
   out of herself: Christ is not to be found within but without; believers
   "go in and out," and so find pasture, food and comfort. Or, 4. By it
   may be meant any open or public place, where she should not be ashamed
   to own his person, gospel, ordinances, cause and interest; for those
   who are ashamed of him and his words before men, he will be ashamed of
   before his Father and his angels (Mark 8:38). Or, 5. By her finding him
   and kissing him without, may be meant her going forth to meet him,
   claiming her interest in him, and signifying her affection to him,
   before men and angels, at his second coming (see Matthew 25:6).

   III.The opinion which she had entertained, that she should not be
   despised and reproached for such an act as this; yea, "I should not be
   despised; or, they would not despise me;" [960] that is, the people of
   the land, as the Targum paraphrases it. Now this opinion of hers might
   arise, 1. From the relation Christ stood into her as a brother; for how
   unseemly and immodest soever it might be for a maiden in the streets to
   kiss a stranger, or one not related to her; yet nobody would reproach
   her for using this freedom with an own brother; which would be
   accounted as chaste and harmless an action in her, as if she had took a
   sucking child out of the nurse's arms, and kissed it; no more immodest
   and unbecoming is this act of the church's; and therefore she
   concludes, that she should not be despised for it. 2. From the
   reception she believed that she should meet with from Christ; who would
   not turn away his face from her, when she made such an offer to him;
   which would occasion shame and blushing in her, and others to laugh at
   her; but she was well assured of the contrary, and that it would be
   kindly accepted by him. 3. From her having so good an husband as
   Christ; which might be known by this familiarity between them; and whom
   she had no reason to be ashamed of, nor others to despise her for
   having none; not to have a husband, being matter of reproach in those
   days (see Isa. 4:1, 54:4, 5). 4. From her prospect of future
   fruitfulness she doubted not but that by being married to such an
   husband, she should bring forth fruit unto God, and so not be despised
   for being barren and unfruitful; it being accounted reproachful to be
   so (see 1 Sam. 1:6). 5. It may be expressive of her great love to
   Christ, and of her boldness and confidence in owning and professing
   him, without either fear or shame, [961] before men and angels; she
   knew that she could not be justly despised and reproached for it; and
   if she was, she did not value it. 6. She may have respect to those
   apprehensions which the wicked will have of the saints in the last day;
   however mean and despicable the saints may appear to the wicked now,
   being in a state of imperfection, loaded with reproaches, and attended
   with a variety of sorrows; yet they will appear otherwise, and that in
   their apprehensions too another day, when they would be glad to change
   places and conditions with them; though Lazarus "was despised when he
   lay in his sores at the rich man's gate," yet he was not when in
   Abraham's bosom. Thus the church might conclude that how much soever
   she may be despised now for owning and professing Christ, yet she
   should not, when she should go forth to meet him at his second coming,
   and he set at his right-hand in gold of Ophir.

Chapter 8 Verse 2

   I would lead thee and bring thee into my mother's house, who
   would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine, of
   the juice oaf my pomegranate.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are still the words of the church, discovering the
   resolutions and desires of her heart after communion with Christ, and a
   discharge of her duty to him: in which may be observed,

   I.Her resolution to "lead and bring him into her mother's house."

   II.Her expectation of receiving instruction there; "who would instruct
   me."

   III.The entertaiment she promises to give him; "I would cause thee to
   drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate."

   I.She resolves to lead and bring him into her "mother's house:" wherein
   may be considered, 1st, What may be intended in those acts of leading
   and bringing. 2dly, What by, her "mother's house," whither she should
   lead him, and into which she would introduce him.

   1st, It will be proper to consider what those acts of leading and
   bringing intend. We frequently read of Christ's leading his church and
   people; but never, as I remember, but in this place, of the church's
   leading Christ: Christ leads his church as a king does his subjects, or
   as a general does his.308 army; for he is given to be a leader and a
   commander to the people; which he performs, by ruling them with
   wholesome laws, and protecting them in their rights and liberties from
   all their enemies: thus (Deut. 32:12), "the Lord alone did lead Israel
   of old, and there was no strange God with them;" thus David (Ps.
   78:72), the type of Christ, fed the same people, "according to the
   integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his
   hands:" He leads them also as a shepherd does his flock, gently, as
   they are able to bear it to suitable pastures, and proper
   resting-places; and likewise as a master does his scholars, leading
   them by his Spirit into all truth, and showing them the fullness and
   glory of the everlasting covenant: moreover, Christ leads his people,
   as a guide does a stranger; for they know not the way everlasting
   themselves, and therefore commit themselves to his guidance and
   conduct; who, though he leads often in rough paths, yet always in a
   right way, to the city of their habitation: likewise he leads them, as
   a nurse does her child; taking them by the hand, he teaches them to
   walk by faith, and leads them into their Father's presence; and also as
   an husband leads his wife, when he brings her home, introduces her into
   his house, consummates the marriage, and makes her a partner of all his
   goods; hence the phrase, ducere uxorem, to lead a wife, is used to
   express the act of marriage: thus it appears to be no very difficult
   matter to understand how Christ may be said to lead his church; but how
   she may be said to lead him, does not appear so manifest and easy. The
   act seems to import these following things: 1. That she used much
   familiarity with Christ; for, for one person to take another by the
   hand and lead along, discovers this: Christ allows his church much
   freedom with him; which she may make much use of, without incurring the
   reproach and scandal of forwardness or immodesty; seeing it is her own
   brother, nay, her own husband, whom she thus treats. 2. It shows much
   tender love, affection, and respect to Christ; as also a welcome of him
   to her mother's house: thus friends and relations show their respect
   and affection to each other and a hearty reception of them into their
   houses, by taking them by the hand, and leading them in. 3. It also
   denotes honor given to Christ by her, becoming his stateliness and
   majesty; thus kings and great persons are usually led: she treats him
   according to high station, as she is in Psalm 45:14, 15, and leads him
   along, as kings and conquerors are led when they march in triumph, 4.
   All this is done by prayer and entreaty in the exercise of faith:
   Christ is easily prevailed upon by his church, through the exercise of
   faith in prayer; he is, if I may be allowed the expression, to be led
   any way by believers, in things which are consistent with his revealed
   will, and what will make for their good and his glory.

   Much in the same sense are we to understand the other act of bringing;
   which, (1.) On her part may denote the strength of faith in prayer;
   which held him, and would not let him go, until she had brought him
   into her "mother's house:" like Jacob of old, who, when the angel said
   to him (Gen. 32:26), "let me go, for the day breaketh," answered, "I
   will not let thee go, except thou bless me:" thus (James 5:16), "the
   effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much?" (2.) On his
   part much condescension, in allowing such mean and worthless creatures,
   as believers in themselves are, to take him by the hand, lead him
   along, and bring him where they would have him.

   2dly, The next thing to be inquired into, is, what is meant by her
   "mother's house," where she desired to bring him: which may be
   expressive, 1. Of her desire to have the marriage consummated; the
   introduction of the bride and bridegroom into their house, being the
   last and finishing ceremony of marriage; thus it is said of Isaac (Gen.
   24:67), that "he brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah's tent, and she
   became his wife:" agreeable to this ceremony, the church expresses
   herself here; only here is this difference, that it was usual for the
   bridegroom to lead and bring his bride into his "mother's house;" but
   here the church promises to lead Christ to her mother's house; Christ
   and the church's mother being one and the same. 2. Of her desire to
   have the knowledge of Christ spread among her near relations, those of
   her mother's house; for nothing is more common than for persons, when
   they are converted themselves, to desire the conversation of their near
   relatives; an instance of which may be observed in the apostle Paul
   (Rom. 11:1-3). 3. Of her desire to enjoy his presence in the church,
   which may be meant by her "mother's house;" for the catholic and
   invisible church, or "the general assembly and church of the
   first-born, which are written in heaven," may be said to be the mother
   to the visible church on earth in any age of the world; for this is
   "the Jerusalem which is above, which is the mother of us all;" as may
   also the visible church on earth be to the several particular and
   congregated churches; and every particular and congregated church may
   be said to be the mother of particular believers, or converted persons:
   so that, (1.) The church is their mother's house, where they are
   begotten and born again; for "of Zion it shall be said, this and that
   man was born in her," (Ps. 87:5). (2.) Where they are educated and
   brought up; for Zion's children, as they are born in her, so they are
   nursed at her side (Isa. 60:4). (3.) For which they have a great deal
   of zeal and affection, as persons usually have for the place of their
   nativity and education; and this in imitation of, and conformity to
   Christ; of whom it is said, that "the zeal of God's house had eaten"
   him up (Ps. 69:9). (4.) Where they take much pleasure and delight to
   be; are glad when asked to go up unto it; because there they meet with
   the presence of Christ, receive instructions from him, and are employed
   in delightful service by him. (5.) This is not only the church's
   mother's house, but also Christ's Father's house; nay, his own house;
   which might be an inducement to him to go along with her (see John
   2:16; Heb. 3:6).

   The reasons which might induce her to desire and endeavor the
   introduction of him into her mother's house, may be such as these: 1.
   That she might enjoy free and uninterrupted communion with him; which
   end was attained by her, as appears from the following verse. 2. That
   others, even those of her mother's house, might have the benefit of
   Christ's presence and company, as well as herself; which shows her to
   be of tree, noble and public spirit: like those saints, in 1 John 1:3,
   who were concerned for the comfortable well-being of others, as well as
   of themselves. 3. That the ordinances of her mother's house might be
   blessed unto her; for she knew full well that those breasts of
   consolation would be but dry breasts without his presence; and, like
   the mantle of Elijah, he of little service and usefulness, without the
   Lord God himself. 4. That she might be assisted by him in the service
   of the house: there are a great many works of faith and holiness to be
   performed herein, which she knew she was not able to do of herself; but
   that through Christ strengthening her, she could do all things.

   II.She expected instruction in her mother's house, upon the bringing of
   him there; and this she expected either from her, or else from him; for
   the word in the Hebrew text will bear a reading which will suit either
   sense.

   1st, They may be read, "who teacheth me;" [962] referring it to her
   mother, who would do so; so Junius and Tremellius read them, to which
   our version agrees, and which is also favored by R. Aben Ezra. From
   whence may be observed, 1. That the church is a school of instruction,
   where souls are instructed in the ways of Christ, in the doctrines of
   the gospel, and in all the duties of religion; both how to carry
   themselves in the church, and how to behave themselves agreeably to
   Christ, in all acts of love and obedience to him; which she may here
   have chiefly a regard unto: it seems to be an allusion to a grave and
   prudent woman, who, taking her new-married daughter apart by herself,
   teaches her how to behave herself towards her husband, that so she may
   have his affections, and live comfortably and happily with him: some
   such instructions the church expected from her mother. 2. That the
   greatest believers are not above instruction, and the means of it; but
   count it a mercy to have both the one and the other; some persons who
   know nothing as they ought to know, think they know every thing better
   than others; and therefore are above ordinances, despise instruction,
   and contemn the ministry of the word; but those who know most of
   themselves and of Christ Jesus, desire to know more, value the means of
   instruction, and make use of the ordinances of the gospel to improve
   therein: the difference of these two sorts of persons may be seen in
   Proverbs 9:8, 9.

   2dly, The words may be rendered, "thou shalt instruct me," [963]
   meaning Christ; and this sense is favored by the Targum upon the place,
   and is followed by many interpreters; for though the church is the
   school, and ordinances are the means of instruction; yet Christ is the
   teacher, who teacheth as none else can: this the church knew, and
   therefore expected instruction from him in her mother's house; being
   there in the way of her duty, where persons may more reasonably look
   for it. Now when Christ and the church are in their mother's house
   together, he instructs her, and shows her her interest in all the goods
   of the house; acquaints her with her work and duty, and how she ought
   to behave herself towards him; he gives some such marriage-precepts as
   those in Psalm 45:10, 11. "Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and
   incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's
   house; so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty; he is thy Lord, and
   worship thou him:" He informs her what respect and affection, homage
   and obedience; he expected from her; and that she should not now hanker
   after her own kindred and relations, being married unto him.

   Now Christ teaches and instructs his church and people many ways: as,
   1. By his Spirit; who being sent by him, teaches them all things, goes
   before them, and leads them into all truth, as it is in Jesus (John
   14:26, 16:13), 2. By his ministers; who are both fathers and
   instructors to Christ's babes, and therefore are called "pastors and
   teachers:" pastors, as they have the oversight of the flock; and
   teachers, as they are the instructors in Christ's school. 3. By the
   scriptures; which "are profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for
   correction, for instruction in righteousness;" for there is nothing
   written there, whether promises or doctrines, words of advice and
   direction, or of exhortation and comfort, but what is "written for our
   learning; that we thro' patience and comfort of the scriptures, might
   have hope," (2 Tim. 3:16; Rom. 15:4). 4. By his ordinances; for as in
   his church he teaches men his ways, so he teaches them by them, and in
   their waiting and attending on them. 5. By afflictive providences; he
   sometimes takes the rod, and makes use of that to promote his people's
   learning, when need requires; and "blessed is the man whom he
   chasteneth," and thereby teacheth out of his law (Ps. 94:12).

   III.She promises him a noble entertainment; I "would cause thee to
   drink of spiced wine, of the juice of my pomegranate:" some think, here
   is an allusion to a custom at marriage; when a cup of wine, after a
   benediction of it, was given to the new-married couple, who both drank
   of it; [964] and in some places, the custom was [965] for a young woman
   to bring in a cup of wine, all her lovers being present, and deliver it
   into the hand of him she fixed on to be her bridegroom; and by this
   action declared him to be so: and so here the church, by proposing to
   give to Christ a cup of her spiced wine, as the Vulgate Latin version
   renders it, declared him, and acknowledged him to be her husband. This
   is a different kind of entertainment, than what the old synagogue gave
   Christ; who, when she found him in the street, did not kiss him, showed
   no respect to him, made no profession of him, nor did she exercise any
   faith upon him, nay, despised those who dig so; she was so far from
   leading and .bringing him into the temple, which the Jews [966] here
   understand by her mother's house, that she thrust him out of it, and
   gave him gall for his meat, and in his thirst gave him vinegar to
   drink; or, as one of the evangelists says (Mark 15:23), "wine mingled
   with myrrh;" which, though it is of a sweet smell, yet is of a bitter
   taste: but the church here promises him spiced wine, such as was
   accounted the most pleasant and agreeable; and "the juice of her
   pomegranate," for her plants were an orchard of pomegranates; from the
   fruit of which a delightful juice is squeezed, of which is made a
   pleasant wine; and the word which is here translated juice, signifies
   must, [967] sweet or new wine; and so it is rendered in Isaiah 49:26;
   Joel 1:5; Amos 9:13; and Pliny [968] speaks of a wine made of
   pomegranates, which he calls rhoites; mention is also made of it in the
   Talmud [969] and by Maimonides: [970] there was a city in the tribe of
   Dan, called Gathrimmon, Joshua 21:24, "the winepress of the
   pomegranate," or where they made pomegranate-wine; and the word here
   used comes from one which signifies to force, squeeze, or trade under
   (see Mal. 4:3), spiced wine was much used by the ancients; it was
   thought less inebriating; [971] and therefore they sometimes put into
   their wine myrrh and calamus, and other spices; [972] sometimes it was
   a mixture of old wine, water and balsam, and of wine, honey and pepper;
   [973] sometimes wine and honey. [974] These sorts of wine were no doubt
   accounted the best, and therefore she resolves to treat Christ with
   them: by which may be intended, 1. The richness and plenty of this
   entertainment; a banquet of wine being accounted the richest banquet:
   hence the provisions of grace under the gospel, are represented by it
   (Isa. 25:6), as are also the joys of heaven (Matthew 26:29). But here
   these metaphorical phrases intend the graces of God's people; which,
   when in exercise, are preferred by Christ to the richest wine. 2. The
   variety of it; here are spiced wine, and wine of pomegranates,
   different sorts of wine; which are expressive of the various graces of
   the Spirit, which are implanted in the hearts of Christ's people. 3.
   The delight and pleasure which Christ takes therein: for even one
   single grace, even that of love, is said to be "better than wine, and
   the smell" of such ointments than all spices; which delight and
   pleasure is expressed by his drinking of it; see chapter 4:10 and 5:1.
   With the Hebrew writers, [975] pomegranates are said to be a symbol of
   concord: the tree was sacred to love. [976]

   first word words may be considered, either, 1. As a petition that it

   the mercy which she had been seeking for, and had faith in; and so be
   read, as in chapter 2:6, where they are more largely explained.

Chapter 8 Verse 4

   I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
   that ye stir not up, nor awake my love until he please.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words are either the words of Christ or of his church; who,
   having the presence and company of, and enjoying communion with each
   other, forbid all interruption, as has been observed on chapter 2:7,
   where the same words are used, as they are also in chapter 3:5, but
   with this difference: 1. The phrase, "by the roes and by the hinds of
   the field," which is used in the two former texts, is here omitted; not
   because there is less vehemency and earnestness in this charge than in
   the former: for, 2. There is also a difference in the form of
   expostulation, which seems rather to express her earnestness the more;
   for the words maybe rendered thus, "Why will ye stir up, and why will
   ye awake;?" [979] etc., which seems to imply as if she was apprehensive
   that they were about to do it; and that there was no danger of it; as
   also that it was an unreasonable thing in them to do it; and what would
   be every way as prejudicial to them as it would be to her; and
   therefore they ought to be careful, as well as herself, not to disturb
   him, nor provoke him to depart: the allusions is to virgins, that sung
   songs at marriages; one in the evening, lulling to sleep; and another
   in the morning, awaked and stirring up from it: [980] the church would
   not have her beloved awaked by them in such a manner.

Chapter 8 Verse 5

   (Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her
   beloved?) I raised thee up under the apple-tree; there thy mother
   brought thee forth, there she brought thee forth that bare thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words are,

   I.A question put by way of admiration, concerning the church who is
   here described: 1st, By her ascent out of the wilderness. 2dly, By her
   posture in coming up from thence; "leaning upon her beloved."

   II.Some things asserted, either by Christ or by his church; "I raised
   thee up," etc.

   I.Here is a question put by way of admiration, "Who is this," etc. Not
   by the angels, as some [981] think; though it is true, they admire the
   grace that is bestowed upon mortal men, and rejoice at the faith and
   conversion of sinners: but it is much more likely that these are the
   words of the daughters of Jerusalem; who being strictly charged, in the
   former verse, to give no disturbance to Christ and his church, who were
   enjoying communion and fellowship with each other; look more earnestly
   at her, whom Christ had so much honored and indulged with such
   earnestness to himself, at which they seem astonished and surprised.
   Though others [982] have considered them as the words of the Jewish
   church, wondering at the conversion of the Gentiles, and their sudden
   reception into the embraces of Christ. Others [983] have taken them to
   be the words of the bride herself, declaring what Christ said to her
   when he first met her, as she was coming up from the wilderness; or
   else, expressing her great love and affections to Christ, which
   appeared by her coming out of the wilderness, forsaking all for him,
   encountering with all difficulties, running all risks, that she might
   enjoy his company; and therefore says, "Who is this," etc., or where is
   there another that has done the like, or shown the like love to him as
   I have done? Which is not to be understood as though she boasted in
   herself; for she acknowledges, that it was by his grace and strength
   that she had been enabled to do this, which is expressed in the very
   next words, "leaning upon her beloved;" for she could never have been
   able to come up from the wilderness had she not had his arm to lean
   upon. Though they seem rather to be the words of Christ himself; not as
   being ignorant of her, or as not knowing who she was; but as admiring
   at the graces of his Spirit in her, and especially that of faith,
   signified by her "leaning on her beloved;" as he had admired her love
   and affections to him, in a like form of speech, in chapter 3:6, which
   are there compared to "pillars of smoke."

   The person who is here inquired of and wondered at, is either the
   Gentile church, which, before the gospel was brought thither, was much
   like a desert and wilderness; to which it is frequently compared in the
   prophecies of Isaiah; see chapter 32:15,16 and 35:1,6 and her coming
   out of the wilderness, may signify her conversion to the faith of
   Christ: or else, the springing up of a new church may be here intended;
   and, because an Arabic word is here made use of, Brightman thinks it
   intends the conversion of the eastern part of the world, Arabia,
   Persia, Egypt, Assyria, and refers it to the prophecy in Isaiah
   19:23-25, though rather the bride, who is all along spoken of in this
   song, is here meant; who had attained to a greater degree of faith, and
   had larger experiences of Christ's love, and was allowed a more
   intimate communion with him; and is described here,

   1st, By her ascent from the wilderness, The Septuagint read the words
   thus, "Who is this that cometh up in white, [984] or clothed in white?"
   though there is nothing in the Hebrew text to favor such a version; yet
   this appears to be the apparel of the church in other places,
   especially in the book of the Revelation, chapter 3:4,5 and 19:8, where
   she is said to be "arrayed in fine linen, clean and white;" which fine
   linen is said to be "the righteousness of the saints," etc. that which
   Christ has wrought out for them, and is by an act of God's grace
   imputed to them; for their own righteousness doth not deserve the name
   of "fine linen, clean and white;" that being at best but as "filthy
   rags, and as an unclean thing." But the words are better rendered, "Who
   is this that cometh up from the wilderness?" by which may be intended,
   either, her conversion from a state of nature, her being called and
   chosen out of the world: or her deliverance out of some great
   affliction as the saints are said to "come out of great tribulation,"
   (Rev. 7:14). But of all this, see more on chapter 3:6.

   2dly, She is described by her posture, in this her ascent out of the
   wilderness, "leaning upon her beloved;" which is expressive of much
   confidence in him, and familiarity with him which she was allowed by
   him to use, and which she might, without justly incurring either shame
   or reproach; for he, on whose arm she leaned, stood in a near relation
   to her, being both her husband and her brother. The word translated
   leaning, is only used in this place, and is differently rendered: 1.
   Some, among which are Many Jewish interpreters, [985] from the use of
   the word in the Arabic language render it, joining or associating, or
   cleaving to her beloved: the church had given up herself to Christ, to
   be his for ever; was resolved, through grace to abide with him, and to
   go with him, whithersoever he went; that act of faith in God's people,
   which, in the New Testament (2 Cor. 8:5), is expressed by a giving up
   of themselves to the Lord, to serve, honor, and glorify his name, is
   frequently expressed in the Old Testament (Isa. 56:3, 6; Jer. 50:5), by
   a joining of themselves unto him; which, when they have done, they
   cleave unto him with full "purpose of heart;" resolving, with Ruth,
   that where he goes, they will go; where he lodges, they will lodge;
   that his people shall he their people, and his God their God; nay, that
   in the strength of his. grace, they will abide with him, and by his
   interest even unto death. 2. Others read the words thus, rejoicing or
   delighting herself "in her beloved;" [986] which sense the Vulgate
   Latin seems to have a regard to, as well as expresses the sense of our
   version, by reading the words thus, deliciis affluens, innixa super
   dilectum suum, "flowing with delights, leaning upon her beloved;" as
   does also the Targum, which thus paraphrases the words, and they shall
   delight themselves in the mercy of the Lord: Christ and his church take
   mutual delight and pleasure in each other; as she is fair and pleasant
   for delights in his esteem, so he is in hers: saints delight themselves
   much in taking a view of his personal glory, in his comparable beauty,
   transcendent excellencies, inexhaustible fullness, and unsearchable
   riches; it is not only their duty to "rejoice in the Lord always;" but
   this interwoven in the very make, frame, and constitution of their
   souls, as renewed by grace: hence they are said to be "the circumcision
   which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have
   no confidence in the flesh," (Phil. 3:3). 3. The Septuagint render it,
   "strengthening herself upon her beloved," that is, being conscious of
   her own weakness and ability to perform the duties of religion,
   withstand the temptations of Satan, escape the snares of this world,
   and hold on and continue in her Christian race, she applied herself to
   Christ; in whom she saw both "righteousness and strength" for her; and
   from whom she received both; the one as her clothing, the other as her
   armor; the one as her title for glory, the other to enable her to hold
   out until she arrived thither. 4. Others translate the words thus,
   "casting herself upon her beloved:" [987] sensible souls will cast
   themselves at the feet of Christ for mercy, and into the arms of Christ
   for safety, shelter and security; they will cast their burdens upon the
   Lord, to be eased from them by him, who has promised to sustain them;
   and they will cast their care upon him, knowing that he careth for
   them; nay, they will venture their souls upon him, and commit the whole
   affair of their salvation to him; as undoubtedly the church did here.
   5. Our version reads it, "leaning on her beloved;" [988] which is the
   use of the word in the Ethiopic language: [989] confidence and trust in
   our own strength; wisdom and righteousness, is sometimes expressed by
   leaning thereunto, as in Job 18:15; Proverbs 3:5; and so is faith in
   our Lord Jesus Christ, by leaning on him (see Isa. 50:10). By faith
   believers lean upon Christ's person, for their acceptance with God;
   upon his righteousness, for their justification before him; upon his
   fullness, for every day's supply; and unto his blood, for pardon and
   cleansing: who is such a staff or prop as will never deceive them; upon
   which they may venture to lay the whole stress of their Salvation, as
   it seems the church did here. The attitude in which the church was
   seen, seems to be this: she appeared coming up from the wilderness, arm
   in arm with her beloved, her arm under his armhole: for a word from
   this here used, signifies "the arm-hole;" [990] which was expressive of
   great freedom, familiarity and fellowship with her beloved, and of her
   close affection to him, firm trust in him, and dependence on him.

   II.In the following part of this text are some things asserted; either
   by Christ concerning his church, or else by the church concerning
   Christ; "I raised thee up under the apple-tree," etc. These words may
   be considered as the words of Christ; [991] showing by whom and by what
   means the church was raised out of her former mean condition, and was
   brought to that honor and dignity which she now enjoyed.

   1st, Says he, I raised thee up under the apple-tree: which may either
   intend the work of faith and conversion, which is the quickening or
   raising up a soul that is dead in trespasses and sins unto a newness of
   life; or else, the awakening of a sleepy and drowsy saint. If we
   consider the words in the former sense, they will lead us to observe,
   1. The state and condition that the church was in before conversion;
   which Christ, it may be, remarks unto her, to teach her humility, that
   she might not be puffed up with spiritual pride, and forget what she
   once was; she was dead in sin, and must have continued so, had not
   Christ raised her up; she was like the wretched infant, in Ezekiel
   16:6, which was "cast out in the open field, to the lothing of us
   person in the day that it was born;" in which condition Christ found
   her, being like a new-born infant, thrown under an apple-tree, and
   there left naked and helpless; where he took compassion upon her, and
   said unto her, whilst in her blood, live: moreover, some regard may be
   had in this place unto the manner how she came to be in this condition;
   which was through Adam and Eve's eating the forbidden fruit, which some
   have thought to be the apple; whereby "sin entered into the world, and
   death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have
   sinned," (Rom. 5:12). 2. That the work of faith and conversion is a
   resurrection from the dead; which for ever secures persons from being
   hurt by the second death (see John 5:25; Rev. 2:110. 3. That this work
   belongs to Christ, is performed by him, and the glory of it to be given
   to him; "I raised thee up, etc." this work cannot be effected by the
   free-will and power of man, but by the mighty and efficacious grace of
   Christ; hence he is said to be the resurrection and the life (John
   11:25). No less a person than be, who said to Lazarus, come forth, can
   raise a dead sinner; and no less a power must be exerted in doing this
   work, than was in the resurrection of Christ's dead body (see Eph.
   1:19). 4. Christ's doing of this work upon the hearts of his people, is
   a very great indication of his love to them; he speaks of it here as a
   peculiar favor done to his church (see Eph. 2:4; Jer. 31:3). But,

   If we understand these words of the awakening of her when asleep, they
   may teach us the following things: 1. That she was fallen asleep; which
   is sometimes the case of God's own people, as in chapter 5:2. 2. That
   this befell her when she was under the ordinances, under the shadow of
   the apple-tree, chapter 2:3. 3. That Christ will not suffer his people
   to continue so; but will, by some means or other, awake them out of it.

   2dly, He says, that there her mother brought her forth, [992] etc. Here
   he expresses her conversion by a regeneration, as he had before by a
   resurrection; by both which names it is very well known in the New
   Testament; which work, though it is effected by the grace and Spirit of
   God, yet the ministry of the word and ordinances are the instrumental
   means thereof which Christ has placed, continues, and blesses in his
   church for that end.

   But the words seem rather to be the words of the church, [993] speaking
   these things concerning Christ; for though there is nothing in our
   version to determine the sense this way; yet the suffixes in the Hebrew
   text being of the masculine gender, manifestly show that they are
   spoken of a man, and not of a woman. And,

   1st, The church says, that she raised Christ up under the apple-tree;
   that is, she sitting under the ordinances of the gospel, which are the
   shadow of the apple-tree, to which Christ is compared in chapter 2:3,
   and finding no communion with him, he being as it were asleep all the
   while, did, by earnest prayer and entreaty, at length raise him up; so
   that she enjoyed a large degree of nearness to him, and familiarity
   with him.

   2dly, That there his mother, which is the church and every true
   believer; see chapter 3:11 (and Matthew 12:50), brought him forth: as
   did, 1. The Old Testament-church, who long waited for him, and was
   often in pain, as a woman with child, on that account, until this
   man-child was born; which was at length accomplished, to the joy of all
   those who waited for the consolation of Israel. 2. With much pain did
   the apostles bring Christ forth into the Gentile world, by professing,
   him, preaching his gospel, and suffering for his sake: thus did they
   travail in birth, until Christ was formed in the hearts of men. 3. It
   is with much pain, even like that of a woman in travail, that the new
   birth, or the work of regeneration on the heart, which is no other than
   Christ formed there, is wrought; all, more or less, who are called by
   grace, pass under a work of the law, which is a killing letter; which
   puts the soul to a great deal of pain; pricks it to the heart, and
   makes it cry out, What shall I do to be saved? 4. The New Testament
   church, which is also Christ's mother, in the exercise of faith and
   prayer, is waiting for his second coming; nay, is not only looking for
   it, but is hastening to it; is uneasy, and as it were like a woman in
   travail, until he makes his appearance; which he will shortly do,
   through the incessant and continued cries and entreaties of his people:
   and this may be the reason why the phrase is doubled; there thy mother
   brought thee forth; that is, the Old Testament church, who waited for
   his manifestation in the flesh; "there she brought thee forth that bare
   thee;" that is the New Testament church, which looks for his second
   appearance. K. Aben Ezra interprets these words of the raising,
   loosing, and bringing forth of the King Messiah, through the prayers
   and entreaties of the Jews; who fancy that he now lies bound and fast
   asleep, but will ere long be awaked and loosed through their prayers,
   and appear for their deliver, ance from present exile, and captivity;
   which is all vain and delusive.

Chapter 8 Verse 6

   Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love
   is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof
   are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word words may be considered either as the words of Christ, or of
   his church. Some [994] think that they are the words of Christ
   expressing his desire to be set as a seal upon the heart and arm of his
   church; and the argument, reason, or motive, which he makes use of to
   prevail upon her to grant him this request, is taken from the exceeding
   greatness of his affection to her; which is compared to the strength of
   death, the cruelty of the grave, and the vehemency of flaming coals of
   fire.

   I.He makes a request to her, that he might be "set as a seal," both
   upon her heart and arm: by which he may intend, 1. An inward and
   abiding principle of love and affection in her towards him: the
   church's love to Christ is highly valued by him, especially when it
   comes from the heart; for mere expressions of love, without an inward
   principle of it in the heart, are not satisfying to him; for what he
   requires, is, to "love him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
   and with all thy mind: let us love therefore, not in worst, neither in
   tongue," that is, only, "but in deed and in truth;" for this is what he
   seeks for, and is highly esteemed of by him. 2. A manifestation of this
   affection to him outwardly; it should not only have a place in our
   hearts, but also be shown by our actions, which should be in conformity
   to his will; "for if ye love me," says he (John 14:15), "keep my
   commandments." Christ should have both our hearts and our hands. 3. A
   constant remembrance of him, and continual looking to him: as seals
   worn upon the arm, or in a ring upon the finger, are continually in
   sight, and put in remembrance whose they are, or whose image they bear;
   so would Christ be always in his church's sight and mind; for we
   should, as David did, "set the Lord always before us," and continually
   look unto him, which is both pleasant and profitable; pleasant, because
   we behold him "full of grace and truth;" and profitable, because we
   receive from him "grace for grace." 4. A greater likeness to him:
   conformity .to Christ's image is one great end of predestination; which
   is begun in the hearts of his people by his Spirit; is increased by
   those transforming views he gives them of the glory of Christ's person;
   and will be completed in heaven, when they "shall be like him, and see
   him as he is:" believers have the image of Christ enstamped upon them;
   for as they "have borne the image of the earthly, they shall also bear
   the image of the heavenly;" which is, to have Christ set as a seal upon
   the heart and arm, so as that he leaves an impress of his image there;
   which conforms both heart and life unto him, and cannot but be desired
   by him; for every like loves its like. 5. A close adherence to his
   person, gospel, cause and interest; having made an open and public
   profession of him, we should "cleave to him with full purpose of
   heart," as Ruth did to Naomi; or as a signet does to a man's right hand
   on which it is worn, 6. and lastly, In this request of Christ to the
   church, his design may he, that she might appear to be his, and only
   for his use and service; as things are known to be such a man's
   property by his mark or seal being upon them; so the church is known to
   be Christ's, by his seal being upon both her heart and arm; which is
   himself; who is inwardly received, and outwardly professed by her; for
   whose use and service all she is and has are; being "a garden inclosed,
   a spring shut up, a fountain sealed."

   II.The argument, reason or motive, which he makes use of to induce her
   to take notice of his request, is taken from the ardency of his love
   and affection to her, which is signified by those several following
   expressions:

   1st, He declares that that his love to her was strong as death: he
   loved her so, that he died for her; he preferred her to his own life,
   and chose death rather than to go without her; which is a full proof
   and evidence of his love to her, and shews the exceeding greatness of
   it; for, as in John 15:13. "Greater love hath no man than this, that a
   man lay down his life for his friends;" which may very well be improved
   by him, as an argument or reason why she should love him again;
   manifest that love, bear him continually upon her mind, cleave close
   unto his cause and interest, seek after a nearer conformity to him, as
   well as reserve herself and all she had for his use and service.

   2dly, He asserts his "jealousy to be cruel as the grave:" by which may
   be meant, either, 1. His zeal for his church's good and his Father's
   glory; so this word is sometimes rendered (see Isa. 9:6, 63:15), which
   zeal of Christ's, like the inexorable, cruel and devouring grave,
   consumed his time and strength, and at last his life; as appears from
   his own words, "the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up," (Ps. 69:9).
   He, as the great prophet in Israel, showed a becoming zeal for the
   gospel; which appeared by his warm and lively preaching of it; his
   assiduity and constancy in it, the frequent and wearisome journeys he
   took to do it; the risks and dangers he ran upon that account; as well
   as the many miracles he wrought to confirm it, and the care he took to
   free it from calumnies, aspersions and prejudices: He likewise showed
   the like zeal for the discipline of his Father's house; as is manifest
   from his severe reflections on human traditions; his asserting the
   purity of worship to be in Spirit and in truth; as also his frequent
   inveighings against the vice of professors; as well as his great
   courage in clearing the temple from the defilers of it; which heroic
   action of his is particularly recorded in John 2:14-17, which put the
   disciples in mind of what was before written of him: moreover, his zeal
   was no less fervent for the salvation of his people, and the glory of
   his Father, concerned therein; which plainly discovered itself in his
   voluntary assumption of human nature, and cheerful submission to the
   death of the cross on their account. Or else, 2. By it may be meant his
   vengeance on his and their enemies; and in this sense the word is used
   (Deut. 29:20; Isa. 59:17), what was a day of grace and salvation to his
   people, was a day of vengeance to his enemies; for no sooner was the
   year of his redeemed come, but the day of vengeance was in his heart;
   which he executed upon them without any mercy, pity, or compassion; his
   jealousy or vengeance was cruel as the grave; he spared them not; he
   made an end of sin, abolished death, destroyed Satan, and spoiled
   principalities and powers. Or else, 3. By it may be meant, the jealousy
   which he justly entertains of his people's faith in him, love and duty
   to him who frequently turn aside from him to other lovers, of which he
   often complains, being jealous over them with a godly jealousy; which
   is no other than the height of his love and affection to them; there
   being nothing that he is more anxiously concerned for and jealous of,
   than the faith, love and obedience of his people, test they should be
   given to any other.

   3dly, This strong affection of his to his church, he compares to coals
   of fire, which hath a most vehement flame; by which he would signify
   the ardency and vehemency of his love; how tottering it was to him, and
   how uneasy he was until he had given it vent; thus the prophet
   Jeremiah, chapter 20:9, being reviled and reproached for prophesying in
   the name of God, made a resolution not to make mention of him, nor
   speak any more in his name; but, says he, his word was in mine heart,
   as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing,
   and I could not stay: so Christ's love was like burning coals of fire
   in his bosom, which gave him much uneasiness until he had given it
   vent; as appears from Luke 12:50. I have, says he, a baptism, meaning
   his death and sufferings, to be baptized with, and holy am I
   straitened, distressed, tortured and uneasy, till it be accomplished?
   And now this zeal of Christ's for the salvation of his church, his
   vengeance upon her enemies, his anxious concern that her faith, love,
   and obedience, might not be alienated from him; as also his uneasiness
   until her salvation was accomplished; may well be used by him, as so
   many arguments, to prevail upon her to grant him the abovesaid request.
   Thus much for the first sense of the words, as they may be considered
   as the words of Christ to the church; but the generality of
   interpreters understand them as the words of the church, requesting of
   Christ that he would set her as a seal, both upon his heart and arm,
   because of the greatness of that love which she bore to him; which she
   compares to death, the grave, and coals of fire: and this I take to be
   the most genuine sense of them, as being most agreeable to the suffixes
   in the Hebrew text; I shall consider it much in the same method as I
   did the former. And.

   First, The church requests of Christ that he would set her as a seal
   upon his heart, and as a seal upon his arm: in which she may desire, 1.
   Nearness to him; as a seal must be near, that is worn next the heart or
   upon the arm: the saints are a people near unto the Lord; with respect
   to union, they are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones:
   Christ and believers are like the old primitive Christians, of one
   heart and of one soul; and they would be near to him with respect to
   communion; they would not only, with Job, come even to his seat, but
   also into his arms; would lie in his bosom; nay, are not content
   without a place in his heart. 2. She seems to be desirous of abiding in
   Christ's heart, and that she might be as a signet upon his arm; from
   whence she might never be removed, but there always continue; of which
   believers may be assured, though they are often attended with fears
   about it; for, as in Psalm 125:1, "they that trust in the Lord shall be
   as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever;" they can
   never be removed from off Christ's heart, on which they always are; nor
   out of his arms, in which they are continually enclosed; for "they
   shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of his hand."
   3. She desires a share in his heart's love and affection, and that she
   might be valued and esteemed by him as a signet upon his right hand
   (see Jer. 22:24; Haggai 2:23), for there is nothing more desirable to
   believers than the love of Christ and the discoveries of it; for his
   loving kindness is better than life; may they but have a share in
   Christ, an interest in his favor, be but valued and esteemed by him,
   they care not how they stand in the world's esteem, what they say of
   them, or can do unto them. 4. She seeks for a continuance of his love,
   which may be depended on; for, "having loved his own which were in the
   world, he loved them unto the end," (John 13:1). Christ's love is like
   himself, "the same yesterday, today, and for ever;" from whence it is
   impossible that any separation should ever be made. 5. She also wanted
   and sought after an assurance of Christ's love, which is the Spirit's
   work, and is expressed by sealing in scripture (see Eph. 1:13, 4:30),
   which he performs, either more generally, by that work of grace which
   he has begun, and is carrying on in the hearts of believers; for from
   his drawing of them to Christ with loving kindness, they may conclude
   and be assured of their interest in his everlasting love; or else more
   particularly, by some special testimony of his, which he bears together
   with their spirits, that they are the children of God. 6. In this
   request she likewise presses after a manifestation of his love to her
   soul, by the arm of his almighty power, delivering her out of all
   temptations, and supporting and bearing her up under all afflictions,
   trials and exercises; which had wrought out salvation for her, and had
   plucked her as a brand out of the burning. 7. She desires a continual
   remembrance of him; and seems to allude to the high-priest, who had the
   names of the children of Israel engraven, like the engravings of a
   signet, upon precious stones; which were borne by him, both upon his
   shoulders and upon his heart, for a memorial before the Lord
   continually; which was typical of Christ, [995] our great high-priest,
   who represented the persons of all the elect upon the cross, and now
   bears them upon his heart before the throne in heaven; whither he is
   gone to appear in the presence of God for us. 8. She desires to be
   always in his sight, and under his care and inspection, as his people
   always are; for they are graven upon the palms of his hands, and their
   walls are continually before him: they are as the apple of his eye, his
   jewels and peculiar treasure; which he has his eye always upon, and
   continually watches over, lest they should be lost, or any hurt come
   unto them.

   Secondly, The reason of this request of hers, she adores to be the
   exceeding greatness of her love unto him; which she compares to death
   for its strength, to the grave for its cruelty, and to burning coals of
   fire for its insatiable and devouring nature.

   1st, She asserts her love to Christ to be as strong as death: the
   meaning of which is, 1. That as death conquers all, kings and peasants,
   high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, young and old, weak or
   strong; there is no disputing his authority, nor controlling his power;
   but all ranks and degrees of men must, whether they will or no, be
   subject to him, the king of terrors: so her love to Christ overcame all
   things, and surmounted all difficulties which stood in the way of her
   enjoying him; she could part with, and bear all or any thing for the
   sake of Christ; father, mother, wife and children, houses and lands, a
   good name, credit and reputation, are nothing to the believer in
   comparison of Christ, which he cheerfully quits when they stand in
   competition with him; nay, things that are the most frightful in
   nature, cannot scare him from Christ, nor separate him from the love of
   him; such, as tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness,
   peril and sword; nor death itself in its most formidable appearance;
   [996] for in all these things he is more than a conqueror, through
   Christ that has loved him: Perfect love casts out fear; it dreads
   nothing, runs all risks, encounters and surmounts all difficulties,
   that it may enjoy the object loved, 2. As her love, like death, had
   conquered all things, So she herself was conquered by it; [997] it had
   wounded her sore; so that she was as one gasping, panting, dying, just
   ready to expire, unless she had the sight and enjoyment of him whom she
   loved. 3. Such was her love to Christ, that death itself was nothing to
   her, so that she might but win Christ and be found in him: the book of
   martyrs furnishes us with many instances of those bold, daring and
   heroic lovers, who loved not their lives unto the death, for the sake
   of Jesus; the most exquisite torments, and most cruel deaths they have
   been put to, have rather inflamed, than lessened their love to Christ;
   so that their love to him has not only been as strong, but even
   stronger than death. 4. Her meaning may be, that love had so captivated
   her, and worked so powerfully in her, that she was as a dead carcass,
   that might be moved and drawn by him whithersoever he pleased; the love
   of Christ constrained her to live to him, and not to herself; for love,
   as one [998] expresses it, is a kind of a civil death: lovers rather
   live at the will and pleasure of others whom they love, than at their
   own; and so the church did here for a frown, or an angry look or word
   from Christ, was as death unto her.

   2dly, She says, that her jealousy was cruel as the grave: by which may
   be meant, 1. Jealousy of Christ's love unto her; either as it intends
   the heighth of love, love at its akuh; or else that evil, groundless
   suspicion of not enjoying another's love, or of having a rival in it,
   which Solomon calls, (Prov. 6:34, 35), "the rage of a man;" and may be
   said to be cruel as the grave; for such an one, "he will not spare in
   the day of vengeance; he will not regard any ransom; neither will he
   rest content, though thou givest many gifts;" now if jealousy is taken
   in this sense here, it intends those fits of unbelief, which sometimes
   attend the people of God; who are often jealous of Christ's love to
   them: and ready to suspect his regard for them; which exceedingly
   tortures and afflicts them, and must not be reckoned their excellency,
   but their weakness; for of all people in the world, they have the least
   reason to entertain such thoughts of him. 2. By it may be meant the
   envy of the wicked against the saints, which is very great; for they
   would, as much as in them lies, deprive them of the common rights and
   liberties of mankind, as well as debar them the free enjoyment of their
   religious exercises; which is a great affliction to the people of God;
   for Proverbs 27:4, "wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is
   able to stand before envy, or jealousy?" it is the same word which is
   here used; in this sense the Targum or Chaldee paraphrase on our text
   understands it. Or, 3. By it may be meant her zeal [999] for Christ,
   his gospel, cause and interest: thus Elijah is said to be, 1 Kings
   19:10, jealous for the Lord of hosts, that is, zealously affected to
   him, and concerned for his glory; which, like the grave, is of a
   devouring and consuming nature; for, says David (Ps. 119:139), "my zeal
   hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words:"
   Virgil [1000] gives the epithet of cruel to love.

   3dly, The church expresses the ardency and vehemency of her love to,
   and zeal for Christ, by comparing them to coals of fire; live coals,
   such as have their coruscations, which flash and flame, and are bright
   and vehement; and to these her love may be compared, for the following
   reasons: 1. In such coals of fire there is light; so there is in the
   church's love to, and zeal for Christ. for though she believes in, and
   has love for an unseen Christ; yet not for an unknown Christ; for,
   ignoti zulla cupido; her zeal is not a blind, misguided zeal, but is
   according to knowledge, 2. In such coals, there is heat as well as
   light: it is true, sometimes the love of God's people waxeth cold,
   through the prevalency of corruption, and the cares of the world; it is
   like coals of fire covered with ashes; which seem to have no life nor
   heat in them; but then at other times it is re-kindled and re-inflamed
   by the Spirit; either under the hearing of the word, or in meditation
   upon the glory of Christ's person, love and grace; "my heart," says
   David (Ps. 39:3), "was hot within me; while I was musing, the fire
   burned; then spake I with my tongue:" nothing sooner raises it into a
   flame, then fellowship and communion with Christ Jesus; agreeable to
   what the disciples said to one another (Luke 24:32). "Did not our
   hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he
   opened to us the scriptures?" Again, though they are sometimes cold,
   lukewarm and indifferent in their frames, yet at other times they are
   fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. 3. Fire is insatiable; it is one
   of those "four things which say not, it is enough," (Prov. 30:16), so
   is love; for it would always have more of Christ; it is never satisfied
   with communion with him; but, like the horse-leech at the vein,
   continually crying, "Give, give:" and for the same reason love is
   compared to death, and jealousy to the grave, in the preceding
   sentences (see Hab. 2:5).

   Moreover these coals of fire are said to have a most vehement flame;
   nothing is more common with other writers, [1001] than to attribute
   flame to love, and to call it a fire; and here a most vehement flame is
   ascribed to it; or, as it is in the Hebrew text the flame of Jah, or
   Jehovah: [1002] by which is meant, either, (1.) An exceeding great or
   most vehement flame, as our Translators have well rendered it; for when
   the Hebrews would express the superlative degree, or increase the
   signification Of a word, they sometimes use some one or other of the
   names of God; as mountains of God, and cedars of God, for most high
   mountains, and most excellent cedars. Or, (2.) It may mean a flame that
   is kindled by the lord; [1003] for it is by the Spirit of the Lord, who
   is compared to fire in scripture, that this flame of love is first
   kindled in our souls. Or, (3.) it may be in allusion to the fire upon
   the altar of burnt-offerings which was always kept alive; and so a fit
   emblem of love, which is of an abiding nature (see Lev. 6:12, 9:24) and
   can never be extinguished, as is expressed in the following words.

   I.Is represented as inextinguishable and insuperable; many "waters
   cannot quench it, neither can the floods drown it."

   II.As exceeding valuable and inestimable; "if a man would give all the
   substance of his house for it, it would utterly be contemned:" Which
   may be understood, either of Christ's love to his church, or of the
   church's love to Christ; for as these words stand connected with the
   former, and are spoken by the same person, they must be interpreted the
   same way; and I shall first consider them as they may be expressive of
   the excellency of Christ's love: which,

   I.Is inextinguishable and insuperable; it cannot be quenched by many
   waters; nor drowned by all the floods,

   1st, Of sin and corruption, which have overflowed all human nature; for
   "all have sinned and come short of the glory of God:" sin, like a
   mighty torrent, or rather inundation, has entered into the world, and
   brought death along with it, upon all the posterity of Adam; it has
   drowned them in destruction and perdition, as all hurtful and foolish
   lusts do. Now the elect of God themselves are not exempted from this
   universal deluge; but though these waters of sin have come into their
   souls and overrun all the powers and faculties thereof; yet they have
   not extinguished Christ's love towards them; nor in the least alienated
   his affections from them it is true, when he first loved them, he saw
   them in all that glory and perfection, which his Father designed to
   bring them to, and which they will appear in, in another world; yet
   when the great council was held concerning their redemption, they were
   presented to him as plunged into the depths of sin and misery; which
   was so far from setting his heart against them, that it rather moved
   his pity and compassion for them, and gave him an opportunity of
   showing the exceeding greatness of his love towards them; for upon
   this, he readily and cheerfully became their surety, engaged to assume
   their nature, lay down his life for them, and thereby satisfy law and
   justice in their room and stead; all which agreements were to a tittle
   made good by him, in the fullness of time, for all the elect of God,
   notwithstanding their after-fall in Adam, and their actual rebellion
   against him, as they appeared upon the stage of the world; nay, though
   their innumerable evils compassed him about like floods of water, and
   brought death and the curse upon him; these being imputed to him, and
   laid upon him by his Father; and with which, standing charged by divine
   justice, he suffered to the uttermost that they deserved; yet his love
   continued the same towards his people; for, "having loved his own which
   were in the world, he loved them to the end," (John 13:1). For,

   2dly, By these "waters and floods," may be meant the several
   afflictions and sufferings which Christ underwent for the sins of his
   own people; by which they are expressed (Ps. 69:1, 2), where Christ is
   introduced thus speaking, "Save me, O God, for the waters are come in
   unto my soul; I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am
   come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me." Hence it is, that
   his sufferings are called a baptism, in Luke 12:50, under which may be
   comprehended these following things: 1. "The floods of ungodly men,"
   which compassed him about; some of whom reviled him, others spit upon
   him, others buffeted him, others crucified him, and pierced his hands,
   feet and side; yet his love to his people remained firm and
   unconquerable: nay, though the whole infernal posse of devils was let
   loose upon him, and exercised all their rage and cunning; yet as
   neither "life nor death," that is, all his sufferings, both in life and
   death, could separate his people from his love; so neither could
   angels, wicked angels, nor "principalities and powers." 2. Floods of
   reproaches were poured into his bosom on the account of his birth,
   parentage, and education, his public ministry, the miracles which he
   wrought, and the free courteous, and affable conversation, he used with
   sinners: He was spit upon in Pilate's hall, and mocked at when upon the
   cross, in the utmost misery; yet he bore all this "contradiction of
   sinners against himself," with an uncommon patience; despising all the
   shame that attended these reproaches, for the "joy that was set before
   him," of having all his people with him in glory. 3. The vials of his
   Father's wrath were also poured forth upon him; for though, as God's
   Son, he was always the object of his love, yet, as the sinners surety,
   suffering in their room and stead, he was "cast off and abhorred;" for
   God was wroth with his anointed or Messiah; "terrors took hold on him
   as waters;" when only some few drops of divine wrath fell upon him, he
   "began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy; his soul became
   exceeding sorrowful unto death; his sweat was as it were great drops of
   blood falling down to the ground;" then was it that "the waters began
   to come into his soul," which kept flowing in until the measure was
   quite filled up; yet all these waters and floods could not quench nor
   drown his love towards his people; his affections to them, as well as
   his regard to his Father's will in their salvation, continued the same;
   as appears from those words of his to his Father, in the midst of his
   agony, "not my will, but thine be done." 4. All the sorrows and
   sufferings of Christ, from his cradle to his cross, may be included
   herein; for his whole life was one continued series of suffering, which
   ended in an accursed and ignominious death, to which he voluntarily
   submitted; that so his people might be set free by justice, and
   delivered from death and condemnation.

   3dly, As the love of Christ cannot be extinguished and overcome by all
   the waters and all the floods of sin and corruption in them, nor by all
   the sorrows and sufferings which he has underwent in his own person for
   their sins; so neither can it, by all their water-floods and billows of
   sufferings and afflictions which pass over his members; these indeed
   make them appear mean and abject in the eye of the world, and render
   them the object of their scorn and contempt: yet nevertheless, though
   the sun of persecution has looked upon them, and made them black, they
   are comely in Christ's eye; his heart is not set against them, nor his
   love alienated from them upon that account; for when they "pass through
   such waters," he will be with them; nay, he chooses, approves of, and
   delights in them, when "in the furnace of affliction," and will purify
   them thereby; so that though they "have lain among the pots," and are
   become black and sooty; yet they "shall be as the wings of a dove,
   covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold," (Ps. 68:13).

   II.This love of Christ to his church is also exceeding valuable and
   inestimable; "if a man would give all the substance of his house for
   it, it would utterly be contemned." For; 1. This is not to be procured
   by money, if any should offer to purchase the favor of Christ at any
   such rate, he would be treated with the utmost contempt, as Simon Magus
   was by the apostles, of whom he would have bought the gift of the Holy
   Ghost with money; to whom Peter said (Acts 8:18-20), "Thy money perish
   with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be
   purchased with money:" Christ and his love are of greater value, than
   to be obtained in such a manner; for not only the substance of a single
   person's house, but even the riches of the whole world, and the most
   precious things in nature, are not equal to them (see Job 28:12, 13,
   15-19; Prov. 8:11, 19). 2. Riches will not entitle men to the love and
   favor of Christ; he does not regard them on the account of these;
   though perhaps too many, like Haman, are apt to say (Esther 6:6), "to
   whom would the king delight to do honor, more than to myself?" and so
   "trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their
   riches," to a neglect of divine Providence, and concern about their
   immortal souls; such would do well to consider, that "not many noble
   are called, but God hath chosen the poor of this world," whom it hath
   pleased him that the gospel should be preached unto. 3. Riches will not
   procure Christ's love, favor and regard, neither at the hour of death,
   nor in the day of judgment: when "he takes thee away with his stroke,"
   that is, of death, then "a great ransom cannot deliver thee;" all thy
   bags of money will not buy off thy life one hour, much less secure his
   favor to eternity; for, "Will he esteem thy riches? no, nor gold, nor
   all the forces of strength," (Job 36:19, 20), which will be much the
   same case at the day of judgment; for the righteous judge, who will
   then sit upon the bench, will not be bribed, nor can his favor be
   procured by any such methods: "riches profit not in the day of wrath;"
   for if a man "gain the whole world, and lose his own soul," there will
   be no recovering it; for nothing will be given, nor will be taken "in
   exchange for it." 4. Therefore the love and favor of Christ should be
   preferred by us to all temporal enjoyments; for if his "loving-kindness
   is better than life," then it is better than all the temporal comforts
   and enjoyments of it: we should not covet to have our portion here, nor
   boast ourselves of our wisdom, strength, or riches; but "glory in
   this," that we know the Lord, who "exerciseth loving-kindness in the
   earth." Thus much may suffice for the first sense of the words. I shall
   now proceed to consider them as they may be expressive of the church's
   love to Christ; which also is,

   First, Inextinguishable and insuperable; it cannot be quenched nor
   drowned by many waters, nor all the floods, 1. Of wicked and ungodly
   men; the people and nations of the world, who are frequently compared
   to many waters (see Isa. 17:12, 13; Rev. 17:1, 15), and so most of the
   Jewish [1004] writers understand them here: for the nations of the
   world, and the great men thereof, have not been able, either by force
   or flattery, by cruel edicts or fair promises, to alienate the church's
   love from Christ, nor tempt her to desert his cause and interest. 2. It
   cannot be quenched nor drowned by all the waters and floods of
   persecutions, [1005] which wicked men, by the instigation of Satan,
   have brought upon the people of God thus we read, in Revelation 12:15,
   that the serpent, which is the devil, "cast out of his month water as a
   flood, after the woman," which is the church, "that he might cause her
   to be carried away of it:" by which flood cast out of the serpent's
   mouth, must be meant, either a flood of heresies brought into the
   church to disturb her, and draw her off from Christ, her head, through
   the cunning craft of Satan; or else, a flood of persecutions,
   introduced by wicked and ungodly men, through his instigation, in order
   to affright, scare, and turn her aside from the pure ways of Christ,
   but all in vain; for (Rom. 8:33, 37). "Who shall separate us from the
   love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or
   famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? nay, in all these things we
   are more than conquerors, through him that loved us:" nay, death itself
   attended with the most exquisite torments and barbarous cruelties that
   hell can devise, cannot do it; for saints count not their lives dear to
   themselves, so that they may but "finish their course with joy," and
   bear a noble testimony to "the gospel of the grace of God." 3. The love
   of believers to Christ is not quenched nor drowned by all the waters
   and floods of affliction, which God is pleased to bring upon them: they
   generally have a large share of them; "waters of a full cup are wrung
   out unto them:" yet these, though they are not "joyous, but grievous,"
   do not alienate their affections from Christ, but rather fix them more
   strongly on him; whilst they view all their afflictions as
   covenant-mercies, the effects of wisdom, love and faithfulness, and
   designed for their good, profit and advantage. 4. Neither can their
   love be quenched nor drowned by the many waters and floods of their own
   sins and corruptions: it is true, these are most likely to extinguish
   this fire and flame above all things else, and often do strike a damp
   upon it; for through the "aboundings of iniquity," love oftentimes
   waxeth cold; but yet it is not drenched and drowned there may be a
   leaving the first love; some degrees of heat in it may be remitted, but
   there is no such thing as losing the grace of love entirely; for it is
   an immortal seed, of a lasting, yea, of an everlasting nature. 5. Nor
   can it be quenched nor drowned by all the waters and floods of Satan's
   temptations this enemy of believers oftentimes "comes in like a flood"
   upon them, by filling their souls with blasphemous thoughts, vile
   suggestions, and wicked insinuations; in all endeavoring to draw off
   their love, and alienate their affections from Christ; which he
   sometimes attempts by fair words, shewing them "all the kingdoms of the
   world, and the glory of them," as he did Christ, and promising to give
   them to them, which is more than he can perform, if they will but turn
   their backs on Christ, and his ways; at other times he sets before them
   all the hardships, difficulties, reproaches and persecutions, which
   they will be exposed unto, if they persist therein; and yet all these
   floods cannot quench nor drown their love to Christ. Nor, 6. Can this
   be effected by divine desertions, which are compared to "waves, billows
   and water-spouts," (Ps. 42:5-7), for though these much weaken the
   faith, and disturb the peace of God's children, yet they do not destroy
   their love: Christ's absence gives much uneasiness to believers, brings
   much darkness upon them, and raises many doubts, fears and misgivings
   of heart in them; they cannot, it may be, say at such times with the
   church, "My beloved is mine, and I am his;" yet they can say with her,
   when in the same condition with them, "Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?"
   7. The terrors of the law, and the apprehensions of Goal's wrath which
   believers are sometimes filled with, are set forth by waves and floods
   of water, in Psalm 88:6, 7, 15-17, under which, though there may be but
   little faith, and less joy; yet there may be much love to Christ, great
   longings and earnest desires after the enjoyment of his presence; as
   appears from the case of the Psalmist, now referred to. 8. and lastly,
   All the hardships, difficulties, pressures and reproaches, which may
   attend believers in their Christian race, are so far from destroying
   their love to, and alienating their affections from Christ, that they
   do but rather endear him the more unto them; and make heaven, and the
   enjoyment of Christ there, the more desirable to them now, and the more
   welcome to them hereafter.

   Secondly, This love of believers to Christ is exceeding valuable; for
   "if a man would give all the substance of his house for it, it would
   utterly be contemned:" for, 1. This is not to be bought with money, no
   more than the love of Christ is; no gift nor grace of the Spirit can be
   procured any such way: it is true, race is compared to "gold tried in
   the fire," which we are advised to buy of Christ; but then it is to be
   "bought without money, and without price." 2. As this grace cannot be
   bought with money, so neither will it be parted with for it: a Judas
   indeed, for thirty pieces of silver, forsook his master, and betrayed
   him into his enemies hands; as Demas also deserted the apostles, and
   cause of Christ, "having loved this present world;" but these things
   cannot prevail upon true believers to do the like. For, 3. The offers
   of a man's whole estate, nay of the riches of the Indies, or vast
   treasures of the whole globe, if made on terms and conditions of
   parting with Christ, or deserting his cause and interest, would be
   treated with the utmost disdain and contempt; they would "utterly be
   contemned;" or, "in despising they would despise" it, as the words may
   be read from the Hebrew text. For, 4. The things of this world appear
   but mean in the believer's eye; who "counts all things but loss and
   dung, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus:" nay, he is
   willing to part with all for Christ, and does, when called to it, "take
   joyfully the spoiling of his goods, knowing that he has in heaven a
   better and a more enduring substance." 5. The sense of this clause is
   thus given by some: [1006] that those who spend their substance, their
   time, their strength, nay, their very lives, for the love they bear to
   God, Christ, his ways, cause and interest, are but laughed at,
   despised, and set at nought by those who are destitute of it; which
   sense is favored by the Septuagint version, which renders the words
   thus; "If a man would give all his living away in love, or charity, in
   despising they would despise him." Now the constancy and
   insuperableness of this precious and valuable grace of love in her soul
   to Christ, is improved by the church to obtain the former request; "set
   me as a seal upon thine heart," etc. for my soul is all in flames of
   love for thee, which cannot be extinguished by all I suffer on thy
   account, nor will be parted with for all that the world can give me;
   which love of hers discovers itself, not only in a regard to Christ,
   but also in a concern for others, as appears from the following words.

Chapter 8 Verse 8

   We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts:
   What shall we do for our sister, in the day when she shall be spoken
   for ?
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are either the words of the daughters of Jerusalem, [1007]
   who were concerned for the welfare of the church; or else of Christ,
   [1008] being solicitous for the conversion of the elect uncalled; or
   rather of the church, [1009] who, having in the preceding verse
   discovered a very strong affection to Christ, here signifies her hearty
   concern for the good of others, which go under the appellation of a
   little sister; an own sister, near and dear to her, [1010] a loving
   expression; by whom may be meant, either the unconverted elect in
   general; or else, some new church that was to be set up in some certain
   age or period of time; or rather, the whole Gentile church, who is
   called so by the Jewish church: so that they seem to be the words of
   the old Jewish church, signifying her affection to and concern for the
   Gentile church, which was then uncalled. In which may be observed,

   I.That the Jewish church asserts and owns the relation that the Gentile
   church stood in, both to her and Christ, at that present time; "we have
   a little sister."

   II.She describes her, 1st, By her being little, 2dly, By her having "no
   breasts."

   III.She manifests her concern for her; "what shall we do for our
   sister, in the day when she shall be spoken for?"

   I.The old Jewish church asserts and owns the relation, in which the
   Gentile church, though uncalled, stood in both to her and Christ; "we
   have a little sister." In which may be considered, 1st, In what sense
   the Gentile church is sister to the Jewish church. 2dly, How she
   appears to stand in the same relation to Christ. 3dly, How she could be
   said to be so at that present time.

   1st, The Gentile church may be said to be a sister to the Jewish
   church, for these following reasons: 1. In a more general sense;
   because Jews and Gentiles are both of one and the same blood; for God
   "hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face
   of the earth," (Acts 17:26), 2. On the account of their being
   neighbors: thus Samaria and Sodom are said to be sisters to Jerusalem;
   the one the elder, the other the younger (Ezek. 16:46). 3. Because, in
   a spiritual sense, those who are Christ's, whether they be Jews or
   Gentiles, are Abraham's seed (Gal. 3:28, 29). 4. The elect of God,
   whether among the Jews or Gentiles, belong unto, and are interested in
   one and the same covenant of grace (Isa. 42:6, 49:6). 5. Believers in
   Christ, of either race, are born of one and the same Father, brought up
   in one and the same family, and are heirs together of the grace of life
   (Eph. 2:19, 4:4). 6. Christ stands in the relation of an elder brother
   to the Gentile, as well as to the Jewish church; and therefore these
   two must be sisters (Rom. 8:29). 7. The church catholic or universal,
   with respect to its several parts, is called a mother, and that
   frequently in this song; see chapter 1:6 and 3:4 and 8:2 and so
   agreeably, the parts of it, with respect to themselves, may be called
   sisters, being mothers children. 8. They are of the same faith and
   religion, as to the substance of it: it is true, there is some
   difference as to the circumstantials of worship, which are now laid
   aside; but the true spiritual nature and object of it are the same: the
   Old Testament saints "eat the same spiritual meat, and drank the same
   spiritual drink," as saints do under the New; the articles of their
   faith are the same; for converted Gentiles believe "none other things
   than those which Moses and the prophets did say should come," relating
   to Christ's person, grace, work and office.

   2dly, The Gentile church is not only a sister to the Jewish church, but
   also to Christ; therefore she does not say, I have a little sister, but
   we have one; which way of speaking perhaps she purposely makes use of,
   that she might stir up his affection and concern for her the more, she
   being as much related to him as she was herself: and it may be
   observed, that Christ is not ashamed to own his church, whether of the
   Jewish or Gentile race, as standing in this relation to him; nay,
   rather seems to take pleasure in viewing her under this consideration,
   as appears from his frequent use of it, in chapter 4:9, 10 and 5:1, 2,
   where this character is more largely opened.

   2dly, There remains a difficulty in this clause to be removed; and that
   is, how the Gentile church could be said be£ore calling to stand in the
   relation of a sister, either to Christ or to the Jewish church; for she
   expresses herself in the present tense, we have a little sister: which
   difficulty will be removed, if we consider these following things; 1.
   She was so in divine predestination; just as the elect uncalled are
   said to be Christ's sheep before conversion (John 10:16), "Other sheep
   I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring in:" by
   which are particularly meant the Gentiles; who were sheep, though
   wandering, though not yet brought in by grace, nor folded in a
   church-state: the same are called, "the children of God" before
   conversion (John 11:52), though scattered abroad, and not openly and
   visibly appearing to be "fellow-citizens of the saints and of the
   household of God;" for though they are not in the possession of
   adopting grace, yet: they are "predestinated unto the adoption of
   children;" on the account of which they may truly be said to be related
   to the saints, who are called by grace, 2. The Gentile church was
   brought into this relation in the everlasting covenant; in which Christ
   not only stood as an elder brother and glorious representative to both
   churches, but also espoused them both to himself; so that they stood in
   the relations of sister and spouse to him, and of sisters one to
   another: thus Christ is said to be the husband of the Gentile church,
   before her calling and conversion (Isa. 54:5), "Thy maker is thine
   husband, the Lord of hosts is his name." 3. The calling of the Gentiles
   being sure and certain in God's promises, all whose "promises are yea
   and amen in Christ," it is represented as if it was already done: as
   things only promised anal prophesied of, though not yet fulfilled,
   frequently are in scripture (see Isa. 9:6, 53:3-5). 4. The Gentile
   church was a sister in the faith of the Jewish Church, who viewed her
   future calling as present; which agrees with the nature of faith,
   defined by the apostle (Heb. 11:1), to be "the substance of things
   hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen?"

   II.She describes this sister of hers: 1st, By her littleness. 2dly, By
   her having no breasts,

   1st, She calls her "a little sister;" so the Gentile church was to the
   Jewish church, 1. In respect of age, being a younger sister: the Jewish
   church was first called, and then the Gentile; which is very fully and
   aptly expressed in the parable of the two sons, the elder and the
   younger, as is thought by some (Luke 15:12-25), the elder signifying
   the Jewish church at that time, which murmured at the grace of God
   bestowed upon the Gentiles; the younger, the Gentiles, who had lived in
   all manner of sin and wickedness, and was disregarded of God, but was
   now embraced with all demonstrations of joy, affection, and tenderness.
   2. She is called so as being in some respects, less honorable than the
   Jewish church; "Who are Israelis," as the apostle says (Rom. 9:4, 5,
   3:1, 2), "to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the
   covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the
   promises; whose are the fathers, and of whom, as concerning the flesh,
   Christ came therefore," as he says, the Jew has the advantage of the
   Gentile, and that much every way; but chiefly, because to them were
   committed the oracles of God. 3. The Jewish church calling the Gentile
   church "a little sister," may express her pity and compassion towards
   her, being like a young and tender infant, that is in a forlorn and
   helpless condition (see Ezek. 16:4, 5). 4. She may be called so with
   regard to her number of converts, either at that time, which were very
   few, few proselytes being then made among the Gentiles to the Jewish
   religion; or else, at the time when the gospel first came among them;
   "for this sect was every where spoken against;" and indeed the whole
   number of Christ's sheep, either among Jews or Gentiles, are but a
   "little flock, when compared with the world." 5. She was then more
   especially, as also at her first calling, but little in spiritual
   stature; her light, knowledge and faith, being but small, not having as
   yet arrived "to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,"
   she was to grow up unto.

   2dly, She says, that "she has no breasts;" that is, 1. She was not
   arrived to years of ripeness; she was not marriageable; her "breasts
   were not fashioned," as in Ezekiel 16:7, the time of her open espousal
   to Christ, by the preaching of the gospel, was not yet come. I call it
   the time of her open espousal to him; for she, as well as the Jewish
   church, her elder sister, was secretly espoused to Christ in the
   everlasting covenant (see Isa. 54:5), but she was not yet espoused to
   him in that sense in which the apostle Paul says (2 Cor. 11:2), of the
   Corinthian, which was a Gentile church, "I have espoused you to one
   husband, that I may present you a chaste virgin to Christ;" the time
   fixed upon for it in ancient council not being yet come; 2. She had "no
   breasts;" that is, at this time she had no ministers nor ordinances,
   from whence she might suck and be satisfied, with the sincere milk of
   the word: moreover, it was some time after the gospel came among the
   Gentiles, that they had a settled ministry; which was fixed by the
   apostles, who "ordained elders in every city."

   III.The Jewish church signifies her very great concern for the Gentile
   church, being thus little, and without breasts, saying, "What shall we
   do," or "shall be done for our sister?" Which shews, 1. That this
   little sister was in a state of nature, uncalled, unconverted, poor,
   miserable, forlorn and helpless. 2. That the Jewish church was
   concerned for her, was moved with pity and compassion towards her; and
   would gladly contribute all she could towards her everlasting
   salvation; as the apostle Paul was for his unconverted kinsmen and
   relations (Rom. 9:1-3). 3. That she not only wished her well, but was
   willing to do any thing for her that lay in her power; though she
   seems, in some measure, to be at a loss what to do; and indeed the
   converted Jews were very much assisting to the spreading of the gospel
   among the Gentiles: they were Jews who first carried the gospel into
   the Gentile world; for it was proper that "out of Zion should go forth
   the law or doctrine, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem;" and
   when tidings of the Gentiles reception of the gospel "came to the ears
   of the church at Jerusalem," they sent forth others also on the same
   errand; nay, supplied them with money, that so they might not be
   burdensome to the Gentiles, nor give them any occasion to reproach the
   gospel; for the fund or stock, which was raised at Jerusalem by the
   believing Jews, who knew that their land would be laid waste, and their
   city destroyed in a little time, and therefore sold their lands and
   possessions, and put the money into the apostles hands; this, I say,
   seems to be designed, not only for their own use, but for the service
   of God in spreading the gospel among the Gentiles; who, when they had
   churches settled among them, upon that consideration were called upon
   to make collections for these poor saints at Jerusalem. 4. She is not
   forgetful of the main and principal agent in this work, who is Christ;
   therefore she says, what shall we do? she was willing to do what she
   could; but she knew that all her endeavors would be of little
   significance, without his agency and blessing: she could send her
   ministers; but if Christ did not: go along with them, and bless them,
   they would meet but with little success; as it is said, "Who then is
   Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as
   the Lord gave to every man? I have planted," says Paul; "Apollos
   watered, but God gave the increase," (1 Cor. 3:5, 6).

   The time that the Jewish church had in view, and is concerned what
   should be done for her then, is, "the day when she shall be spoken for,
   or with." [1011] By which may be meant, either, 1. The time of the
   first preaching of the gospel among them, which, to them, was the
   "accepted time and day of salvation" when Christ, by his ministers,
   spoke to and for them, wooed and beseeched them; treated and communed
   with them, as David with Abigail, about openly espousing them before
   the world: it seems to be an allusion to persons treating either with
   virgins themselves, or with their parents, [1012] about their marriage.
   Or, 2. It may refer to the fame that was spread abroad of the
   conversion of the Gentiles: when it was first effected, it made a great
   noise in the world; the faith of a single church, the church at Rome,
   was "spoken of throughout the whole world:" thus the clause may be
   rendered, "In the day when she shall be spoken of;" [1013] that is,
   when her fame shall be spread far and near; and some will say one thing
   of her, and some another: now the Jewish church seems to be concerned
   how she would behave herself under all this noise and talk about her.
   Or else, 3. The words may be rendered, "When she shall be spoken
   against:" [1014] this has been the common lot of God's children; this
   sect, as it is called, has been in all ages and in all places spoken
   against; and no wonder, for Christ himself is "set for a sign, which
   shall be spoken against:" now the old church might be concerned for
   this new church of the Gentiles; that she might be able to stand firm
   and constant to her profession, notwithstanding all the reviling,
   reproaches and persecutions of men. Or, 4. They may be read thus, "When
   she shall be spoken to;" [1015] that is, when the great men of the
   world, as Nero, and other heathen emperors, shall call her before them,
   and tempt her, either by fair words or severe menaces, to desert the
   faith, of Christ: O! that she might stand fast then, as if the church
   should say, and not be moved away from the hope of the gospel; neither
   be frightened by their threatenings, nor deluded by their promises: she
   was jealous of her, as the apostle Paul was of the Corinthian church,
   lest she "should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ."
   Now this should teach us in general, from the example of the Jewish
   church here, to be concerned for all the elect of God uncalled, and
   particularly for those among the Jews; we should earnestly pray for
   them, and use all proper means and methods to bring them to the
   knowledge of Christ: the time is coming, when they shall be spoken for,
   shall be called by grace, and openly espoused to Christ; and seeing
   they were so much concerned for us, when we were little, and had no
   breasts, we should be as much concerned for them, they being now in the
   same case and circumstances.

Chapter 8 Verse 9

   If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver:
   and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are the words of Christ, in answer to the solicitous concern
   of the old Jewish church for her little sister, the Gentile; declaring
   what should be done for her on such and such considerations.

   I.If, or "seeing she is a wall, we will build upon her a palace of
   silver."

   II."And if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar:"
   all which is expressive of what strength and ornament should be added
   to her, and what grace and glory should be conferred upon her.

   I.He promises, that if or seeing she was a wall; that is, well walled,
   built upon a sure foundation, and firmly established in her faith in
   and love to Christ, and is constant therein, and stands as a wall
   against the attack of enemies; [1016] a palace or tower of silver
   should be built upon her: by which may be meant, either, the scriptures
   of truth, with which she should be furnished: which, for their
   impregnableness and store of spiritual armor that is in them, may be
   compared to towers; and for their purity, richness, and excellency, to
   silver ones: or else, the ministers of the gospel may be intended, who
   are set for the defense of it: or this phrase may in general signify,
   that she should be fortified and put into a posture of defense against
   all her enemies, having on the panoplia, or whole armor of God; walled
   towns and cities, to which the allusion is here made, usually to have
   towers built upon the walls thereof; so Zion is said to have such (Ps.
   48:12, 13), which also this little sister, the Gentile church, should
   not be without: though the word may as well be rendered, a palace;
   [1017] and signifies, that she should be built up an habitation for
   Father, Son, and Spirit, who would come and make their abode with her;
   and being such noble and uncommon guests, a silver palace must be
   erected for them. The persons who were to do this work, are either the
   Jewish church, with her ministers as instruments, and Christ as the
   principal agent; for Psalm 127:1. "Except the Lord build the house,
   they labor in vain that build it:" or else, by the we, are intended the
   blessed Trinity, as in chapter 1:11, who were all jointly concerned in
   raising up a church-state in the Gentile world. From the whole may be
   observed, 1. That he that begins the good work, whether it relates to a
   particular person, or to a church, must and will finish it; the same
   hands which lay the foundation, must raise up the superstructure, and
   complete the whole building, by bringing in "the head-stone with
   shoutings, crying, grace, grace unto it." 2. This verifies the saying
   of our Lord (Matthew 25:20), that "unto every one that hath shall be
   given, and he shall have abundance" grace is usually but very small at
   first, but it afterwards increases much; frequently from small
   beginnings great things arise: this Gentile church at first had but a
   very small appearance of a building; a foundation was just laid, and a
   side-wall erected; but in a short time, a noble structure, a silver
   palace for God, is built up.

   II.Christ also assures her, that if she was a door, she should be
   inclosed with boards of cedar: the meaning of which may be, either, 1.
   If the Gentiles had the door of the gospel opened among them, as they
   had in many places (see Acts 14:27; 1 Cor. 16:8, 9; 2 Cor. 2:12), this
   should be succeeded for the building up of an holy temple for the Lord;
   which should be of such ornament and strength, so well fenced and
   enclosed with the grace and power of Christ, that it should not be in
   the power of all their enemies to deface or demolish it. Or, 2. If the
   door of their hearts was opened to Christ, as Lydia's was (Acts 16:14),
   so as to receive and let in this king of glory, with his numerous train
   of graces; then she should be adorned and beautified with a larger
   measure of them. Or, 3. If when they came into a church-state, the door
   was set open, that so "the righteous nation which keepeth truth, may
   enter in," and yet at the same time careful to exclude others; this
   should make much for their honor, comfort, safety, and security. Or, 4.
   This phrase is expressive of the building being completed; but only it
   wanted some farther decorations and ornaments, which it should not be
   long without: so the setting up of gates or doors to towns or houses
   seems to signify (see Neh. 3 though 5). It seems rather to intend the
   mean, low, and weak state and condition the Gentile church was first
   in, when there was but very little appearance of a building: there was
   only as it were a door set up; which afterwards grew up to be a
   magnificent and stately temple, built up of cedar-boards of the wood of
   Lebanon; of which Solomon's temple was made: and to which an allusion
   here seems to be. But, 6. Some [1018] have thought that these words
   carry in them some intimations of her inconstancy to Christ, and the
   wandering of her affections after other lovers; as also the methods
   which Christ would take to restrain and prevent her: "If she be a
   door;" that is, if she will not keep at home, but will gad abroad, and
   go in and out at pleasure, we will use some methods to keep her in; "we
   will enclose her with boards of cedar;" or, as it is expressed in Hosea
   2:7. "I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she
   shall not find her paths." Though, 7. The meaning rather seems to be,
   that however mean and abject she might appear to be, even as a door,
   yet she should be adorned with grace here, and enjoy glory hereafter;
   both which, for their perpetuity and incorruptibleness, may be compared
   to cedar-boards: besides, the safety and security of the church in this
   present state, her walls being salvation, and her gates praise, may be
   here intended; as well as the delights and pleasures of the heavenly
   state, signified by the fragrant cedar, which she should, ere tong, be
   inclosed and surrounded with.

Chapter 8 Verse 10

   I am a wall, and my breasts like towers:
   then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are either, the words of the Jewish church, asserting
   herself to be what her little sister was not; namely, that she was a
   wall well fenced, and firmly established, was indulged with ordinances,
   and blessed with ministers; whilst the Gentiles lay open, were "without
   Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers
   from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the
   world," (Eph. 2:12), as also confirming what Christ had said in the
   former verse; as well as assuring her little sister, the Gentile
   church, that she should also find favor in Christ's eyes, when she came
   into the same state and condition: unless we should rather choose to
   consider them as expressing that additional glory; peace and
   prosperity, which should accrue to the church by the calling of the
   Gentiles; which would not be inconsiderable, and no small indication of
   her finding favor or peace in Christ's eyes; who would then "extend
   peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing
   stream." Though I rather think, that they are the words of the little
   sister herself, the Gentile church; either signifying her desire to be
   in such a well-settled state and condition, "O that I was a wall!"
   etc., or else, asserting herself to be in such a case, [1019] which
   Christ had intimated in the former verse,

   I.She asserts herself to be a wall.

   II.That her breasts were like towers. And,

   III.Being so, was in his eyes as one that found favor.

   I.She asserts herself to be a wall; that is, 1. Well walled; God
   himself is a wall of fire about his people; Christ's salvation is
   appointed for walls and bulwarks to them; nay, faithful ministers and
   Christian magistrates may in some sense be said to be so, being placed
   for the protection and &fence of the church. 2. She is one of those two
   walls, to which Christ is the comer-stone, as he is called (Eph. 2:20),
   the Jewish church is one, and the Gentile the other; which both meet
   and make up one building in Christ, the middle wall of partition being
   broken down. 3. She is a wall built up of lively stones, cemented
   together in love: the elect of God, by nature, lie in the same quarry,
   are taken out of the same pit, and hewn from the same rock, as others
   are; but being separated from them by distinguishing and efficacious
   grace, are hewn and fitted for the building by the Spirit of God, where
   they are laid by him, and knit together in the bond of love. 4. She was
   firmly built on Christ, the foundation; which God has laid in Zion, and
   is sure, firm, and lasting, against which the gates of hell can never
   prevail; and which will be sufficient to bear up and support the church
   and all believers, who lay the whole stress of their persons, and the
   salvation of them upon it. 5. She was well established in the doctrine
   of faith: the Gentiles received the gospel with all readiness of mind,
   when the Jews rejected it; and though it was in much affliction, yet it
   was with much joy in the Holy Ghost; and when they once got it, they
   could not be moved away from it, by all the frowns and flatteries,
   promises, and threatenings of men; Which, to their adversaries, was an
   evident token of perdition, but to them, of salvation, and that of God;
   so the Targum and R. Solomon Jarchi interpret these words of the
   steadfastness of the congregation of Israel; in the religion and laws
   of God. 6. She was constant and immoveable in her love to Christ; she
   was a wall; she was proof against all temptations and insinuations, and
   not a door, that easily let into her affections every one that knocked:
   she loved Christ dearly, and kept her love inviolate and pure for him;
   nothing could separate her from it; the greatest pleasures and profits
   of life could not tempt her to desert him; nor the most dreadful
   sufferings and torments deter her from expressing her affections to
   him; she was like a wall that stood invincible and impregnable.

   II.She says, that her breasts were like towers; which may in general
   denote her ripeness for marriage; her breasts were fashioned; were
   round and plump, and rose up high like towers; she was now
   marriageable; the time of her being presented as a chaste virgin to
   Christ, and of her open espousals to him, was come. Or else more
   particularly,

   1st, By her breasts, may be meant the ministers of the gospel; who,
   like nurses (1 Thess. 2:7), give the breast to "newborn babes," and
   feed them with the " sincere milk of the word;" and, like towers, are
   set for the defense of the gospel: such ministers the first church
   among the Gentiles had; whose ministry was not only edifying and
   nourishing, but they themselves also were faithful, zealous, and
   courageous in the discharge thereof; and could not be moved, from their
   station, nor be made to desist from their work, by all the violence and
   oppression of men. Or else,

   2dly, By these breasts, may be meant the two Testaments, the Old and
   the New; which are both full of the milk of excellent doctrines and
   precious promises; which are all useful for the comfort, edification
   and instruction of God's people; and from whence, as from towers, they
   may be supplied with all needful armor, to repel Satan's temptations,
   refute, erroneous doctrines, and defend the gospel; and though efforts
   have been made by Satan and his emissaries to remove them out of the
   world, yet they still remain impregnable and invincible: now with these
   breasts the Gentile church is blessed.

   3dly, The two ordinances, of baptism and the Lord's supper, may be
   intended; which are peculiar to the church under the New Testament
   dispensation; and are as breasts of consolation to believers,
   especially when they have the presence of Christ in them, and his love
   at the same time manifested to them; these are like towers, have stood
   firm and immoveable against all the efforts of men, to, change, deface,
   subvert and abolish them. The Jews [1020] interpret the wall of the
   congregation of Israel, and the "breasts as towers," of the synagogues
   and schools; also the former of the law, and the latter of the
   scholars.

   III.Being so, she says, she "was in his eyes as one that found favor;"
   which may either respect,

   1st, The time [1021] of her becoming a wall, and having breasts like
   towers; then was I, or "from the time that I was in his eyes, as one
   that found favor or peace;" that is, I became a wall, was firmly built
   on Christ, established in the doctrine of faith, and formed into a
   church-state; had breasts, a settled ministry, and gospel-ordinances;
   which have continued with me ever since I found peace with Christ,
   which he made for me by the blood of his cross. Now this is certainly
   matter of fact, that from the time that Christ became "our peace,"
   (Eph. 2:14), the ceremonial law, which is there called "the middle wall
   of partition," which stood between Jew and Gentile, was removed; so
   that they both coalesced in one church-state, verse 14-16 and equally
   shared in all gospel-ordinances find privileges, verses 17-22, from
   that time the Gentile church began to be a church in gospel-order. Or
   else,

   2dly, It may respect the time of the open manifestation of Christ's
   love, which was when she became a wall, and had breasts. It is true, he
   loved her before, even from eternity, with an everlasting love; but
   that was hidden and secret both to herself and others: but now her
   "breasts are fashioned;" he looked upon her, and her "time is the time
   of love;" he openly espouses her to himself, and lets all the world
   know, as well as herself, what favor she found in his sight: and it
   manifestly appears that she was sensible of it; and by expressing it,
   would signify, 1. That her being a wall and having breasts, were
   instances of his kindness to her; and indeed, it is an unspeakable
   mercy to have a gospel-ministry and gospel-ordinances (Ps. 148:19, 20),
   "He shewed his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto
   Israel: he hath not dealt so with any nation; and as for his judgments,
   they have not known them: praise ye the Lord:" if it was so great a
   favor for the people of Israel to have the law, on the account of
   which, they were called a "great nation:" what an instance of
   surprising and distinguishing grace is it, that we Gentiles should have
   the gospel and the ordinances thereof! The church here esteemed it a
   favor, and so should we. 2. She ascribes all these blessings and
   privileges which she was possessed of, to his grace and favor: Was she
   a wall? it was owing to him; and had she breasts? she acknowledges it
   as an instance of his regard to her; and was ready to say, with the
   apostle (1 Cor. 15:10). "By the grace of God, I am what I am:" an
   excellent example for us to follow. 3. This phrase may be expressive of
   her gracious acceptation with Christ; thus Noah is said to have "found
   grace in the eyes of the Lord," (Gen. 6:8), the Gentiles, who were
   proselyted to the Jewish religion before the coming of Christ in the
   flesh, were like Esther, "standing in the court" alone, for they might
   not worship with the Jews; whom, when Christ looked upon, they
   "obtained favor in his sight;" and he held out the golden scepter of
   his grace, and admitted them to nearer communion with him; built them
   into a church-state, furnished them with gospel-ordinances, and
   graciously accepted both them and their services; he "took pleasure in
   these his people, and beautified the meek with salvation." 4. The
   enjoyment of the presence of God and Christ, is a very considerable
   instance and evidence of finding favor in his eyes: Moses desired to be
   ascertained of his having found grace in God's sight, by the enjoyment
   of this blessing (Ex. 33:15, 16), which he was graciously indulged
   with; and perhaps it is this which the church here had particularly in
   view; and a great mercy it was to have ordinances, and .the presence of
   Christ along with them, than which nothing can be more desirable and
   delightful. 5. The words may be rendered, "then was I in his eyes as
   one that found peace;" meaning that inward peace of conscience, and
   tranquillity of mind, which "passeth all understanding;" which she
   enjoyed in the midst of all her tribulations and sufferings for Christ;
   which he only gives, and which the world cannot take away; for if he
   "giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?" 6. This word "favor or
   peace," may comprehend all these spiritual blessings, wherewith she was
   blessed in Christ Jesus; such as peace, reconciliation, justification,
   pardon of sin, sanctitication, adoption, etc., for he is "a sun and
   shield; he will give grace and glory; no good thing will he withhold
   from them that walk uprightly," (Ps. 84:11). 7. The manifestation of
   Christ's love, which is the greatest blessing in life, may be here
   intended: hence says the Psalmist (Ps. 106:4), "Remember me, O Lord,
   with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people;" and no wonder that
   he should be so desirous of it; for "in his favor is life;" but not to
   enjoy it is death: O! how miserable will those be to all eternity, in
   whom that scripture will be verified (Isa. 27:11), "He that made them,
   will not have mercy on them; and he that formed them, will shew them no
   favor!"

Chapter 8 Verse 11

   Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard
   unto keepers: every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a
   thousand pieces of silver.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word these words the little sister goes on to give an account of
   the success of the Gospel, the planting of churches, and establishment
   of Christ's interest in the Gentile world; together with the advantages
   which accrued to Christ thereby, under the metaphor of a vineyard, and
   the fruit thereof: where we have to consider,

   I.The vineyard itself, and what is intended by

   II.The owner of it, who is Solomon.

   III.The place of its situation, at Baal-hamon.

   IV.The letting of it "out to keepers," and who are meant by them.

   V.The price it was let at, or the rent which they were to bring in;
   "every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of
   silver."

   I.It will be proper to consider what is meant by this vineyard; which I
   think is to be understood of the church of Christ; the Israelitish
   nation, and the church of God therein, sometimes bears this name (see
   Ps. 80:8, 9, 14, 15; Isa. 5:1, 7), and it is very usual with Christ to
   express the New Testament church-state by the same metaphor (see
   Matthew 20:1, 21:33), which was thus prophesied of by Isaiah, chapter
   27:2. "In that day, sing ye unto her, a vineyard of red wine." Now the
   church of Christ may be compared to a vineyard, for these following
   reasons: 1. A vineyard is a spot of ground, separated and distinguished
   from others; so is the church of Christ from the rest of the world, by
   electing, redeeming, and efficacious grace; believers are a chosen
   generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation; and being, so, are a
   peculiar people; they are fenced about with sovereign grace, whereby
   they are made to differ from others. 2. A vineyard is a spot of ground
   set with plants of various sorts, and especially vines: it is manifest,
   from chapter 1:14 and 7:12, that it was usual to set other plants in
   vineyards besides vines; for which see also Luke 13:16. In the
   vineyard, the church, stands in the first place Christ, the true and
   most noble vine; and next to him true believers, who are there planted
   by him, engrafted on him, and grow up in him: now these are of various
   sorts, of different growths and fruitfulness; some are larger and more
   fruitful than others; but are all "the planting of the Lord, that he
   might be glorified:" but besides these, there are some who are only
   externally planted here, and grow up only in a mere outward profession;
   who are not planted by Christ's heavenly Father, and therefore shall be
   rooted up; because, instead of bringing forth right fruit, they bring
   forth wild grapes. 3. Vineyards are valuable to the owners of them; one
   part of their wealth and riches consisting therein: the church of
   Christ is highly esteemed of by him, it being his inheritance, his
   portion, and wherein great part of his riches, as mediator, lies; his
   Father gave it to him, and he values it upon that account; as Naboth
   did his vineyard, because it was "the inheritance of his fathers," and
   therefore would not part with it to Ahab upon any consideration
   whatever: moreover, Christ's esteem for his vineyard, the church, is
   farther manifest from the great price he gave for it, which was his own
   blood, as also from the exceeding great care he takes of it. 4. A
   vineyard is a very fruitful spot; so is the church of Christ and all
   believers, who are "filled with the fruits of righteousness by Jesus
   Christ:" who is " the true vine," on whom they are engrafted; and "the
   green fir-tree," from whom their fruit is found: all that are "planted
   in the house of the Lord," being watered by divine grace, "flourish in
   the courts of our God," and bring forth fruit, whereby he is glorified.
   5. Vineyards are delightful and pleasant; thus among the several
   methods which Solomon took co gratify and indulge himself in pleasure,
   this was one; he "planted himself vineyards," (Eccl. 2:4). The church
   is a delightful vineyard to Christ, where he delights to walk, and
   observe how his several plants grow and thrive; for this purpose he
   often goes down into it, as in chapter 6:11, and the church, knowing
   how much pleasure he takes therein, invites him to it, in chapter 7:12.
   6. Vineyards are not only delightful, but also profitable; there is
   much fruit produced by them, to the advantage of the owners thereof: so
   Christ has much fruit from his vineyard, as appears from this and the
   following verse; which makes for the advancement of his honor and glory
   in the world; for as all their fruit comes by him, and from him, so all
   the glory redounds unto him; and "his glory is great" in every branch
   of their salvation. 7. Vineyards are exposed to beasts of prey, which
   often break in and do much damage to them: the church of Christ is not
   only exposed to the "boar out of the wood," the openly profane world,
   which often makes great havoc of it, by its oppressions and
   persecutions; but also to those foxes, false teachers, heretics, who
   cunningly bring in their pernicious doctrines, to the great annoyance
   and disturbance of the peace, comfort, and faith of God's people; hence
   it is said, in chapter 2:15 "Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that
   spoil the vines; for our vines have tender grapes." 8. A great deal of
   care must be used in promoting the fruitfulness of vineyards; the vines
   must be watered, pruned, and propped up, as well as the stones gathered
   out, and a fence set about them (see Isa. 5:2). Christ does all this
   and much more to his vineyard; he waters it every moment with his
   grace, prunes and lops off the unfruitful branches, supports the weak
   and tender vines with his Almighty power; gathers out all things that
   offend, and fences it about with divine favors; in short, acts the
   whole faithful part of a vine-dresser to it.

   II.The owner of this vineyard is Solomon, by whom the Messiah is meant;
   for it may be truly said, that "a greater than Solomon is here." Christ
   bears this name, because Solomon was an eminent type of him, as has
   been shown on chapter 3:7, he now is the owner of this vineyard; it is
   his, 1. By choice; he has pitched upon this spot of ground, and
   separated it from all others for his use and service. 2. By his
   Father's gift: he asked it of his Father, and he gave it him; "thine
   they were," says he, "and thou gavest them me," (John 17:6). 3. By
   purchase; he has bought this vineyard with his own blood (Acts 20:28).
   4. It is of his own planting: all the vines in it are of his setting,
   and are made fruitful by him. 5. He takes the whole care of it, and has
   the advantage of the fruit thereof.

   III.The situation of this vineyard, at Baal-hamon; perhaps the same
   with Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon (Josh. 11:17, 13:5), since they
   are of the same signification, the master of a multitude, or of a
   troop. By which may he meant, either, 1. The city of Jerusalem; [1022]
   which may be called "Baal-hamon, or the master of a multitude," because
   it was a very populous city; as it is said, in Lamentations 1:1. "How
   doth the city sit solitary that was full of people?" where was the
   principal seat of the Jewish church-state; the letting out of which to
   keepers, the priests and Levites, may seem to suit well with the legal
   and mercenary spirit which much attended the Old-Testament
   dispensation. Though, 2. I rather think the Gentile world is here
   intended; among the nations of which Christ has a gospel church
   planted; whereby the promise is fulfilled to Abraham, that he should be
   a "father of many nations;" which his name signified, and is of much
   the same import with this in our text. Unless, 3. It should be thought
   only to intend in general, the fruitfulness of the soil in which
   Christ's vineyard was planted; at "Baal-hamon," the Lord or master of a
   multitude, [1023] that is, where a multitude of vines grow. Thus it is
   said, in Isaiah 5:2, "My well beloved hath a vineyard in a very
   fruitful hill:" the church of Christ, and so all believers, are planted
   in a very fruitful soil, being "rooted and built up" in Christ, and
   watered with the continual dews of divine grace; the believer is like
   to "a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his
   fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he
   doth shall prosper," (Ps. 1:3).

   IV.The letting out of this vineyard to keepers, is next to be inquired
   into. By the keepers, we are to understand the ministers of the gospel;
   who have their several parts and different employments assigned them in
   this vineyard of Christ. 1. The business of some of them is to plant:
   this work the apostle Paul was much concerned in; "I have planted,"
   says he (1 Cor. 3:6, 8), and indeed it is hard to say how many
   churches, and how many souls in those churches, were planted by him;
   and especially at Baal-hamon, in the Gentile world, with whom he was
   chiefly concerned. 2. Others are employed in watering this vineyard, as
   was Apollos; of whom Paul says, "I have planted, Apollos watered:" some
   ministers are more useful for edification than conversion; their
   ministry succeeds most for the watering of Christ's plants, for
   promoting the comfort and faith of those who are already planted; their
   doctrine drops as the rain, and their speech distils as the dew, as the
   small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass
   (Deut. 32:2), so that they become fruitful. 3. The work of others is to
   prime the vines; they have an excellent talent at reproof, both on the
   account of erroneous doctrines, and immoral practices; they can give
   gentle admonitions where the case only requires them; and rebuke with
   sharpness, cut deeper, where there is a necessity for it; not being
   afraid of the faces of any, but having the good of Christ's vineyard at
   heart; these excel in that branch of their office, which concerns the
   discipline of the church. 4. Others ate useful in supporting and
   upholding weak believers; who, like vines, stand in need of it; which
   they do, by putting into their hand the staff of the promises, and
   refreshing them with the reviving cordials of gospel-doctrines. 5. The
   employment of others is to protect and defend; their business is
   chiefly to take the foxes, to refute heresies, and defend the doctrines
   of grace, and preserve the church from all innovations, both in
   doctrine and worship. Now I would not be understood, as though I
   thought that ministers were so confined to one or other of these
   particular branches of the ministerial work, that they had no concern
   in the rest; for one and the same minister may be more or less useful
   in them all; but yet, generally speaking, he excels in some one of
   them.

   The letting out of this vineyard to them, agrees with those parables of
   our Lord, in Matthew 20:1, 2 and 21:33, where he seems to allude to the
   words of our text; which is no inconsiderable evidence of the divine
   authority of this book. The phrase shows, 1. That though Christ takes
   care of the vineyard himself, yet he also makes use of his ministers:
   Christ is not separated from his ministers; he acts as the owner, they
   as the servants; he is the chief and principal wine-dresser; which work
   he performs mediately by his ministers, who are not to be slighted and
   laid aside; hence the apostle writing to the Corinthians, among whom
   were many divisions about their ministers; some being for Paul in
   opposition to Apollos, and some for Apollos in opposition to Paul; and
   others for Cephas in opposition to them both, and others for Christ in
   opposition to them all; they were for Christ without his ministers;
   but, says the apostle (1 Cor. 1:12, 13), "Is Christ divided?" that is,
   from his ministers; no, they are not to be separated from him, though
   subordinated to him. 2. It shows, that Christ entrusts his vineyard
   with his ministers; he makes them overseers of it; he sets them to
   watch over it, and faithfully discharge the several branches of their
   duty before-mentioned which is meant by the letting it out unto them:
   and it ought to be observed, that Christ has the sole power of letting
   out his vineyard, and he lets it out to whom he pleases; therefore none
   ought to usurp it: it is indeed a great honor to he entrusted with it;
   but no man should take this honor to himself, but he that is called of
   God to it; persons should not run into this work before they are sent,
   nor perform it negligently when they are in it. 3. Christ in some
   respects makes his ministers owners of this vineyard; he let out, or
   gave [1024] the vineyard to keepers; hence, in chapter 2:15, it is
   said, our vines have tender grapes: ministers-have in some sort an
   interest in the vines, the churches; their joy, comfort, life, and
   glory, lie much in the fruitfulness and well-being of them; which is a
   very great and powerful argument to induce them to vigilance,
   diligence, and carefulness, in the discharge of their work.

   V.The price this vineyard was let at, or the rent which these keepers
   were to bring in for the fruit of it, is a thousand pieces of silver:
   which may denote, 1. The exceeding great fruitfulness of this vineyard,
   that the fruit of it was worth so much: thus in Isaiah 7:23, it is
   said, "and it shall come to pass in that day, that every place Shall
   be, where there were a thousand vines, at a thousand silverings, it
   shall even be for briars and thorns;" that is, those places, which were
   so exceeding fruitful before, shall now be barren and desolate. It may
   denote the usefulness of a gospel-ministry; which is to bring home
   souls to Christ; to gather in the fruit of his labors, and travail of
   his soul, which are as dear and valuable to him as a thousand pieces of
   silver; at which he rejoices as much as the poor woman did (Luke 15:8,
   9). at the finding of her lost piece: Christ's ministers are her
   rent-gatherers, and the collectors of his fruit; "I have chosen you and
   ordained you," says he (John 15:10), "that they should go and bring
   forth fruit;" and then do they bring it m, when souls are converted
   under their ministry. 3. The sum to be brought in from every one of
   them is alike, every man his thousand pieces: Christ's ministers have
   indeed one and the dame commission to preach the gospel; but they have
   not all the same abilities for the work, nor are they alike succeeded
   in it; but yet, in the faithful and honest discharge of their work,
   they are all so blessed by him, as to answer the end of their
   ministration designed by him; so that he reckons that every one, even
   the meanest, brings in his thousand pieces, as well as the more able
   and successful. 4. It shows that there is a reckoning-day coming, for
   ministers as well as others; who must give an account of their talents,
   what use they have made of them in Christ's vineyard, and what success
   has attended their labors; which, if they can do with joy, and not with
   grief, will turn to their account, as well as be of advantage to
   others,

Chapter 8 Verse 12

   My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must
   have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word former part of these words seem to be the words of Christ,
   asserting his interest in his vineyard, the church thereby explaining
   and confirming what the church had said in the former verse. The latter
   part of the text appears to be the words of the church, allotting
   proper portions to the owner and keepers of the vineyard.

   I.Christ asserts his claim, right and property in his vineyard, the
   church; "my vineyard, which is mine, is before me:" in which may be
   considered,

   1st, The vineyard itself, which is the church of Christ, and is called
   so for several reasons, which have been shown on the preceding verse.

   2dly, This is expressed in the singular number, a vineyard; for
   Christ's church is but one, as he asserts in chapter 6:9, though it is
   true, we read of vineyards, in the plural number, in chapter 7:12,
   because there are several separate, distinct and congregated churches;
   though these all make up but one catholic church, one "general assembly
   and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven."

   3dly, Christ asserts his right and property in his vineyard, "My
   vineyard," says he; whereby he confirms what the church had said in the
   foregoing verse; where has been shown in what respect he is the owner
   of it, and what kind of right he has to it;

   4thly, He doubles this claim of his unto it; he not only says, "My
   vineyard," but adds, "which is mine;" whereby, 1. He excludes all
   others from having any right unto it; the vineyard is his, and only
   his; he is the sole proprietor of it; none has any thing to do with it
   but himself. 2. By repeating his claim, he shows the certainty of it;
   that his title is unquestionable and indisputable: and indeed what can
   be more sure and evident, seeing his Father has given it to him, who
   had an undoubted right to dispose of it? nay, he has purchased it with
   his own blood, and has it now in possession; he is right heir to it,
   according to God's own appointment though he wicked Jews, the chief
   priest's and Scribes; who were the keepers of the vineyard, when our
   Lord was here on earth, when they saw him, "said among themselves, This
   is the heir, come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his
   inheritance; and they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and
   slew him," (Matthew 21:38, 39). 3. He may use this additional phrase,
   "which is mine," to distinguish it from all other vineyards; as also to
   shew the excellency of it, it being preferable to all others; this
   world, when compared with Christ's church, is a mere desert and
   wilderness; all other vines are of "the vine of Sodom, and of the
   fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are
   bitter," (Deut. 32:32, 33). 4. He repeats it, to signify the great
   delight he took in his vineyard; as it is in itself preferable to all
   others, so it is exceeding valuable and delightful to Christ; he says
   of it, "the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea; i have a
   goodly heritages" (Ps. 16:8).

   5thly, He says, that this vineyard was before him; which may denote, 1.
   The omniscience of Christ; which in general extends to all persons and
   things, that ever were, are, or shall be; "Lord, says Peter, thou
   knowest all things," (John 21:17), but in a more especial manner he is
   concerned about his own people, whom he knows by name, and is
   acquainted with all their wants and necessities; he knows his own
   flock, and the state of it, which the Father has committed to him; he
   knows every sheep and lamb therein, in what condition they are, and
   what is most suitable for them; he knows his vineyard, and the several
   vines which grow there; there is never a plant escapes his notice and
   watchful eye; he is acquainted with every one of them, and in what case
   they are. 2. The omnipresence of Christ; he is the Lord that "fills
   heaven and earth" with his presence; the whole World is before him, but
   more especially his church; where, in a peculiar manner, he grants his
   gracious presence, there he dwells, and will abide for ever; who holds
   the "seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven
   golden candlesticks," (Rev. 2:1). 3. The delights and complacency,
   which Christ takes in his church; it is ever before him; his eye is
   continually upon it; he cannot bear it out of his sight, so dear and
   valuable is it to him: thus it was from everlasting and has continued
   ever since, and so it ever will; his delight from all eternity "were
   with the sons of men," the elect of God, "rejoicing in the habitable
   part of his earth, where he knew," in time, he should have a vineyard
   planted. 4. The care of Christ over his people, "who are engraven upon
   the palms of his hands, and whose walls are continually before him;"
   though Christ does indeed let out his vineyard to keepers, yet he does
   not neglect it himself; he is present with them, and works by them; it
   is still in his own hands, and under his watchful eye; "I the Lord,"
   says he (Isa. 27:3), "do keep it; I wilt water it every moment, lest
   any hurt it; I will keep it night and day." Thus these words may be
   expressive of Christ's claim unto, affection for, and care over his
   vineyard, the church. Though,

   There are some Interpreters who take them to be the words of the
   church, speaking of her vineyard; by which may be meant, her own soul,
   and the particular concerns of it: thus every one has a vineyard to
   look after; and in what condition that of the slothful man's was, may
   be seen in Proverbs 24:30, 31, which was all grown over with the
   thorns, and nettles of sin and corruption; its stone wall or fence was
   broken down, so that he was exposed to every snare and temptation. Or
   else, by this vineyard may be meant, the church in general; for
   believers have a mutual interest in each others persons, gifts, graces,
   prayers, etc. and being all members of one and the same body, should,
   as the apostle says (1 Cor. 12:26), "have the same care one for
   another." Though perhaps the several gifts and talents, whether of
   nature or grace, which God bestows upon his people, may be intended;
   which are all to be used for the glory of Christ, and the good of his
   church for as every one has a vineyard of his own, or a particular work
   assigned him in the vineyard, the church; so he has his particular
   gift, talent and capacity for that work, which ought to be used by him;
   for he must one day give an account thereof. Now the church here says,
   that her vineyard was before her, thereby signifying her care,
   watchfulness, and diligence in it, of which we have an instance, chap.
   7:12, and shows that she was now in a different frame from that of
   which she complains, in chapter 1:6. Though I think that the former
   sense of the words is most agreeable. Yet,

   II.The latter part of the text, "Thou, O Solomon must have a thousand,
   and those that keep the fruit thereof, two hundred," manifestly appears
   to be the words of, the church allotting proper portions: First, To the
   owner of the vineyard, Solomon. Secondly, To the keepers of it, the
   ministers.

   First, She allots to "Solomon a thousand," that is, a thousand pieces
   of silver, as in the former verse: where is to be considered,

   1st, Who is meant by Solomon; by whom, no doubt, the Messiah is
   intended; as is acknowledged by R. Ahen Ezra, [1025] and other Jewish
   [1026] writers though Maimonides [1027] says, that "wherever the name
   of Solomon is mentioned in the Song of Songs, it is holy, and is as the
   rest of the names, except that, a thousand unto thee, O Solomon:" to
   which some [1028] add also, chapter 3:7, but that Christ, and not
   Solomon, is here intended, is most agreeable to the nature and design
   of this song.

   2dly, The church's manner of addressing him, "Thou, O Solomon," shows
   that she was now in his presence, had much nearness to him, and used
   much freedom and familiarity with him, as she was by him allowed to do.

   3dly, The allotment which she makes to him, is, "a thousand;" which, 1.
   Is the sum agreed upon in the former verse for the church is willing
   that Christ should have all that he demands or desires; she would have
   no abatement made, but would have him have his whole due, and full
   revenue of glory from his people. 2. It is a far greater share than
   what is assigned to the keepers; and good reason there is it should be
   so; for he is the head and master of them, as well as the owner of the
   vineyard; he is "all and in all, and God over all, blessed for ever;"
   his is the vineyard, and all the fruit thereof; he has a right unto it,
   and takes the chief care and oversight of it; so that "neither is he
   that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but Christ, who
   gives the increase;" and therefore should have all the glory. 3. This
   shows the fruitfulness of this vineyard, that it yields so large a
   profit both to the owner and keepers of it.

   Secondly, The share allotted to the keepers, is, "two hundred;" from
   whence may be observed.

   1st, That the ministers of the gospel shall have their reward; every
   one that labors in the vineyard shall have his penny; and every man, as
   the apostle says (1 Cor. 3:8), "shall receive his own reward, according
   to his own labor; whether he be employed in watering or in planting."

   2dly, That their having their reward, is no lessening of Christ's; for
   he has his whole thousand, though they have their two hundred; nay,
   Christ comes at a considerable part of his revenue, through their
   having theirs; for "he that receiveth you," says he, (Matthew 10:40),
   "receiveth me;" where ministers are valued and honored, Christ also is.

   3dly, As one [1029] well observes, where Christ gets his due among a
   people, there and there only do ministers get their due; where Christ
   is heartily received, the feet of them that "bring glad tidings" will
   be beautiful; where Christ has his thousand, ministers will have their
   "two hundred;" but if Christ comes short of his due, no wonder that
   ministers should of theirs: but what is this two hundred, which is due
   to the keepers? Why, 1. An honorable maintenance for themselves and
   their families; for "the laborer is worthy of his reward," which is his
   due according to God's ordination: hence the apostle (1 Cor. 9:7-14),
   establishing the truth of this, from several instances in nature, from
   the reasonableness of things, as well as from proofs out of the law of
   God, adds, "even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the
   gospel, should live of the gospel;" but this is but the least part of
   their "two hundred." 2. Honor and esteem among the people, to whom they
   minister, is another part thereof; for (1 Tim. 5:17, 18), the elders
   that rule well, "are to be counted worthy of double honor;" by which
   the apostle means, first an honorable maintenance, as is manifest from
   his following words; and then, that duty and respect which are due to
   them from their people, who ought to "esteem them very highly in love,"
   not for their persons, but "for their works sake." 3. The conversion Of
   sinners is another part of this two hundred; and indeed, godly and
   faithful ministers think that they have a very large share of their
   reward, when their labors are succeeded this way; for, "what is our
   hope," says the apostle (1 Thess. 2:19, 20), "or joy , or crown of
   rejoicing? are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, at
   his coming? for ye are our glory and JOY:" and as the conversion of
   sinners, so the comfort and edification of saints; their steadfast
   adherence to, and continuance in the doctrines of the gospel, are
   likewise a great satisfaction to them; "for now we live," says the same
   apostle (1 Thess. 3:8), "if ye stand fast in the Lord." 4. Eternal
   glory is the complement of it; they will have their full two hundred in
   heaven, how math short so ever they come of it; here; where, instead of
   it, poverty, disrespect and reproach frequently attend them: then "they
   that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars for ever and
   ever," (Dan. 12:3), who when they have "fought the good fight of
   faith," (2 Tim. 4:8), they shall receive "the crown of righteousness,"
   which is laid up for them, and shall be given, not only to them, "but
   unto all them also that love Christ's appearing."

Chapter 8 Verse 13

   Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken
   to thy voice: cause me to hear it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word once thought, as some have, [1030] that these words were the
   words of the church of Christ, whose dwelling-place is in his gardens,
   the churches; to whose voice in the everlasting gospel, the companions,
   or young converts, Listen with great attention and affection; which the
   church observing, stirred up in her earnest desires to hear the same
   with more power and efficacy, life and liveliness: but having
   considered the original text, I find it will by no means bear this
   sense; for the word translated, "thou that dwellest," is in the
   feminine gender, and so regards the bride, and may well be rendered, "O
   thou inhabitress of the gardens" [1031] I though the Septuagint and
   Ambrose render it in the masculine gender, [1032] but wrongly, for the
   word is certainly feminine: hence it appears, that the words are the
   words of Christ, directed unto his bride, the church. In which may be
   considered,

   I.The title and appellation which is given her; "thou that dwellest in
   the gardens."

   II.The notice which the companions take of her; "the companions hearken
   to thy voice."

   III.The request which Christ makes unto her; "cause me to hear it."

   I.The title and appellation given her by Christ, is, "Thou that
   dwellest in the gardens;" or, "O thou inhabitress of the gardens!"
   Where by the gardens, must be understood particular congregated
   churches, as has been observed on chapter 6:2, of which the church
   universal is made up, and wherein it may be said to dwell; the Jewish
   [1033] writers interpret them of the schools and congregations where
   the law was taught. Now her dwelling in those gardens is expressive, 1.
   Of the work she is employed about there; she does not dwell there idle;
   there is work for her to do, which is the reason of her dwelling there;
   and that is, to plant, water, prune and dress the gardens, which she
   does by her ministers: her business here also is to attend upon the
   ministry of the word, and all other ordinances of the gospel, where she
   frequently meets with her beloved; for "he feeds in the gardens, and
   gathers lilies." 2. It denotes her diligence, constancy, and assiduity,
   in attendance on public ordinances: she not only attended now and then,
   but always; she dwelt in the gardens; and like the first Christians,
   "continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in
   breaking of bread, and in prayers," (Acts 2:42). 3. It shows the
   delight she took in being there, seeing she had taken up her dwelling
   there: "the tabernacles of God were amiable to her; a day in his courts
   was better than a thousand elsewhere: this was the one thing she
   desired of the Lord," (Ps. 27:4), and what, with a great deal of
   application she sought for; namely, to "dwell in the house of the Lord
   all the days of her life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to
   inquire in his temple;" because, with the disciples, she judged it was
   good for her to be there; where she enjoyed the presence of Christ, had
   the assistance of his Spirit, and the discoveries of his love. 4. It
   also appears evident from hence, that she made an open profession of
   Christ; she did not creep into those gardens now and then, as it were
   by stealth, but she dwelt in them; she was not like Nicodemus, who came
   to Christ by night; nor those other Jews, who believed in him, but were
   afraid to confess him, for fear-of being put out of the synagogue; nor
   like many in our days, who will not enter into church communion,
   because of being exposed to the reproach of the world; "though with the
   mouth confession should be made unto salvation, as well as with the
   heart man should believe unto righteousness," (Rom. 10:10), for as the
   one is necessary for the comfort of the believer, the other is as
   necessary for the glory of Christ. 5. Her dwelling here expresses her
   steadfast adherence to the profession she had made, as well as her
   constant attendance on gospel-ordinances; she was not as many who
   "forsake the assembling of themselves together;" but cleaved unto the
   Lord and to his churches with full purpose of heart, having an
   affectionate concern for them all; and in this respect she dwelt in
   them: it may be said of her on some accounts, as the apostle said of
   himself (2 Cor. 11:28), that "the care of all the churches was upon
   him;" as appears from chapter 7:12 and 8:8.

   Moreover, from Christ's giving her this title, may be observed, 1. That
   her dwelling in the gardens, was what he approved of, and was well
   pleasing to him; it is his will that saints should incorporate into
   churches, and those who are converted, give themselves up to them and
   continue with them; as appears from his blessing of them, when they are
   there, with greater measures of grace, light and knowledge, larger
   supplies of his Spirit, and sweet enjoyments of his presence, 2. That
   this is a title of honor, and is expressive of what dignity she was
   advanced unto; and indeed it is no small honor which saints have, to
   "have a name and a place in God's house, which is better than sons and
   daughters:" David thought so when he envied the very sparrow and
   swallow, which had made their nests, as he says, "even near thine
   altars, O Lord of hosts, my king and my God!" and then adds, blessed
   are they that dwell in thine house, they will be still praising thee
   (Ps. 84:3, 4), their work, their employ-merit, as well as their place,
   is honorable and glorious. 3. That it was for her profit, as well as
   for her honor, to dwell here for these gardens are stored with all
   manner of precious fruits and above all, there stands in the midst of
   them the apple-tree, Christ Jesus, which is richly laden with a variety
   of excellent fruit, mentioned chapter 2:3, under the shadow of which
   the church frequently sits with great delight, and plucks and eats, and
   the fruit thereof is sweet unto her taste. 4. That she should always
   continue and abide there; he does not say, "thou that didst dwell, or
   shalt dwell in the gardens;" but "thou that dwellest," denoting her
   continued abode there: there is no fear of her being turned out of
   these gardens, as Adam was out of his Eden, "so he drove out the man,"
   (Gen. 3:24), nor are there any cherubim, nor a "flaming sword to keep
   the way of the tree of life;" but all free and open, and nothing
   terrifying and menacing: it is true, every plant which Christ's
   heavenly father has not planted, shall be rooted up; all those who are
   in churches only by a mere visible profession without the truth of
   grace, shall be turned out, with a "Friend, how earnest thou in
   hither?" but as for all true believers, they shall continue and abide,
   until they are transplanted into the heavenly paradise above;

   II.The notice which the companions take of her; they hearken to her
   voice: in which may be inquired, 1st, Who are meant by the companions,
   2dly, What by their hearkening to her voice.

   1st, These companions may be taken either in a bad sense or in a good
   sense. If in a bad sense, as in chapter 1:7, then by them we are to
   understand false teachers, who pretend to be the companions and friends
   of Christ; who artfully insinuate themselves into churches, and would
   have them believe, they "are aiming at the advancement of the same
   cause and interest," and mean the game thing as they do; and thus, with
   feigned words, they introduce their damnable heresies, and make
   merchandise of the souls of men; they listen to the church's words and
   doctrines, to catch and carp at, wrest and pervert, use and improve, to
   answer their own ends and purposes: now these words may be considered
   as a caution given by Christ to the church to beware of them, as he did
   to his disciples (Matthew 7:15) and as Paul did to the elders of
   Ephesus (Acts 20:29, 31), seeing they were listening to what she said,
   not out of good, but ill will; yet notwithstanding he would not have
   her be silent, but, says he, cause me to hear it, or cause to hear me;
   that is, preach me boldly and openly, in no wise being afraid of them;
   for he would not have her speak so softly to him, that the companions
   which listened might not hear, as R. Aben Ezra on the text observes;
   no; for, says he, "what I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light;
   and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the house-tops,"
   (Matthew 10:27), but yet with a proper guard, upon themselves, both
   with respect to open and secret enemies. Though I rather think, that we
   are to understand these companions in a good sense: by whom may be
   meant, either, 1. God the Father, and God the Holy Ghost; [1034] who
   are both the companions of Christ; for "there are three that hear
   record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these
   three are one," (1 John 5:7), they are of one nature and essence,
   possess the same perfections, are partners in the same works both of
   nature and grace, and equally share the glory which results from
   thence; now these divine persons listen to what the church and poor
   believers say; "They that feared the Lord spake often one to another,
   and the Lord hearkened and heard it," (Mal. 3:16). Or else; 2. The holy
   angels may be here intended, as many interpreters, [1035] both Jewish
   and Christian, think; these are the friends and companions of the
   saints; as well as of Christ; they are reconciled to them through
   Christ; are willing to perform all the offices of friendship to them;
   they rejoice at their conversion, bring messages of peace and comfort
   to them; acknowledge themselves to be their fellow-servants, and are
   ministering spirits unto those who are the heirs of salvation: not to
   enter upon the consideration of that question, whether every man hath
   his angel to attend upon him; which I must confess I am somewhat
   inclined to believe, there being some scriptures which seem to furnish
   us with some proofs of it, as Matthew 18:10; Acts 12:15, however this
   appears certain, that the saints have the angels of God attending on
   them; he hath given his angels charge concerning them; they encamp
   round about those that fear him; they are the guardians and companions
   of the saints in life, and at death carry their souls to glory; now
   these listen to what they say in their closets; in their families, in
   their private or public conversation, as seems manifest from
   Ecclesiastes 5:6, they wait upon the public assemblies of the saints,
   and hearken to the voice of the gospel, as delivered by the ministers
   of it; hence that direction is given by the apostle (1 Cor. 11:10), for
   the woman to cover her head in the time of public worship: the angels
   get much of their knowledge in, and acquaintance with the great
   mysteries of grace and salvation, from what they hear from the church
   (Eph. 3:10), and it is with much constancy, diligence, and earnestness,
   that they desire to look into these things (1 Peter 1:12). Or else
   rather, 3. By these companions may be meant the daughters of Jerusalem,
   who all along attended the bride in this song; who are the virgins, her
   companions, as they are called (Ps. 45:14), by which young converts
   more especially may be understood; who listen with a great deal of
   affection and attention to what the church, or older and more
   experienced Christians say; though all believers in general may well
   come under this title of companions, as it is given to them (Ps.
   122:8), for David, though he was so great a man, and in such an exalted
   station of life, yet did not disdain to be called "a companion of all
   them that fear God," (Ps. 119:63). Now the saints may be said to be
   companions of each other for these following reasons: (1.) Because they
   are interested in one and the same covenant, of which Christ is the
   head, surety, and mediator; and have an equal right and claim to all
   the blessings and promises of it. (2.) They have all one and the same
   Savior, are all saved in one way, and share alike in the same
   salvation; for which reason it is called "the common salvation," (Jude
   3), not that it is common to all the world, bat only to the elect of
   God, who are called to be saints. (3.) They are partakers of the same
   grace, particularly that of faith; for the meanest saint obtains like
   precious faith with the greatest; the same may be said of all other
   graces of the Spirit; for indeed as there is but one body, of which
   they are all members: so there is but one spirit which actuates them
   all, even as they are also called in one hope of their calling (Eph.
   4:4). (4.) They are partners, and share alike in the same privileges of
   the gospel, to which they have all an equal right; for they are all
   "fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God." (5.) As
   companions, they frequently converse together; "they that feared the
   Lord, spoke often one to another;" they meet in private, and take sweet
   counsel together, as well as walk unto the house of God in company;
   they sympathize with each other in all conditions, both outward and
   inward; they "weep with them that weep, and rejoice with them that
   rejoice; they bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of
   Christ." (6.) They are here companions together in tribulation and
   sufferings, as John says (Rev. 1:9), and shall be partners together in
   heaven, where they shall enjoy that glorious inheritance which lies
   among them that are sanctified.

   2dly, Now these companions hearken to the voice of the church: by which
   may be meant, either, 1. The gospel, as preached by her ministers;
   which is a joyful sound, and makes delightful music in the ears of
   believers, which are opened and unstopped by the Spirit of God. Or, 2.
   The admonitions of the church, which ought to be hearkened to (Matthew
   18:15-17), and will be regarded by all those who wish well to Zion, who
   have a value and esteem for the authority of churches, and entertain
   mean and humble thoughts of themselves (Ps. 141:5). 3. The voice of the
   church in all other ordinances, and particularly that of singing, may
   be here intended; for the church was now bearing her part in this song
   with Christ; with whose voice these virgins her companions were
   charmed; which made them get the nearer, and more carefully listen to
   her: thus saints should be "teaching and admonishing one another in
   psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in their
   hearts to the Lord," (Col. 3:16). 4. The voice of the church, and of
   true believers in private conversation, is listened to by young,
   converts; because it is that which is good; to the use of edifying, and
   what ministers grace unto the hearers.

   III.The request which Christ makes to his church, is; cause me to hear
   it; that is, thy voice, which is exceeding sweet and charming to
   Christ, as appears from chapter 2:14, where he says, "let me hear thy
   voice;" a phrase exactly agreeable to this, and which is there more
   largely explained, and the reason there given, why he makes such a
   request, is, "because sweet is thy voice:" so is the voice of the
   church, in praying to him, praising of him: speaking largely of his
   person, grace and office; as well as boldly confessing of him before
   men. Though the word here used may as well be rendered, cause me to
   hear me; [1036] that is, preach me, as Junius translates it: and the
   meaning is, seeing the companions thus flock unto thee, and listen with
   the utmost attention and satisfaction to thy voice; take the
   opportunity of preaching me unto them; let my person, blood,
   righteousness, and grace, be the subject of thy ministry. And thus
   indeed it was in the primitive times; for, says the apostle Paul, "I
   determined not to know," that is, to make known "any thing among you,
   save Jesus Christ, and him crucified," (1 Cor. 2:2). The first
   ministers of the gospel did not preach themselves nor others, but
   Christ Jesus the Lord; he was the sum and substance of their ministry;
   and now though this way of preaching was "to the Jews a
   stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness;" yet it was owned of
   God, for the conversion of sinners, and the comfort of saints; and has
   been more or less so in all ages of the world, and will be continued to
   be practiced until the second coming of Christ; which he may perhaps
   here intend, and is what the church earnestly prays for in the
   following verse.

Chapter 8 Verse 14

   Make haste, my beloved and be thou like to a roe or
   to a young hart, upon the mountains of spices.
     __________________________________________________________________

   first word are the words of the church, earnestly imploring the
   presence of Christ. She begins and ends this song; and in both
   signifies her great affection to him, how much she valued his company,
   and how desirous she was of it: this appears throughout the whole song
   to lie uppermost in her heart, affections and desires; she had had much
   nearness of access to Christ, and much communion with him, as appears
   from this chapter, and yet she wants more; she cannot be easy without
   the everlasting enjoyment of him on the mountains of apices. In the
   words may be considered,

   I.The title she gives him; "my beloved."

   II.The request she makes to him; "make haste," etc.

   I.The title she gives him, is, "my beloved;" and is what she had often
   given him in this song: she seems to take delight in using it; in which
   she expresses her love and affection to him, with the continuance of
   it; she acknowledges that he was her beloved still; she claims her
   interest in him, a comfortable sense of which she now enjoyed; hereby
   she also distinguishes him from all other beloveds, and shows that she
   was not ashamed to own him as such; as indeed she had no reason; and
   perhaps she may have a particular view in giving him this title here,
   which is to improve her interest in him, as a motive or argument to
   obtain her request; for such suits that are founded upon the near
   relation which souls bear to Christ, seldom miss of succeeding. But
   having more largely explained this character elsewhere, I shall not
   insist longer upon it; but proceed,

   II.To consider the request she makes: which may be regarded, either, 1.
   As a passionate wish for the incarnation of Christ, that he would
   speedily come and appear on mount Zion, and in the temple where the
   sacrifices were offered up, and the sweet-smelling incense ascended,
   which were both typical of his sacrifice and mediation; nothing was
   more desirable or more importunately prayed for, or more impatiently
   longed for by the Old Testament-church than this was, and yet nothing
   more slighted than it was, when brought about. 2. It may be understood
   as the desire of the church after the spiritual presence of Christ, in
   his house, and upon the mountains of Zion, where he commands his
   blessing, even life forevermore: nothing is more satisfying to
   believers than Christ's presence; it is preferred by them to all the
   enjoyments of life; if thy presence go not with me, says Moses (Ex.
   33:15), carry "us not up hence;" this puts joy and gladness into the
   souls of God's people, more than when corn and wine increase; they are
   oftentimes impatient without it, pant for it, as the hart panteth after
   the water-brooks; for as his absence is death unto them, so his
   presence is life; this fills their hearts with comfort, diffuses an
   universal pleasure throughout their souls; banishes their doubts and
   fears, supports them under all the pressures, sorrows and afflictions
   of the; sets them above the fears of death, and makes them that they
   can look into another world, and an awful eternity, with the utmost
   satisfaction and serenity of mind; so that it is no wonder that
   Christ's gracious presence should be so desirable to saints: besides,
   there was good reason for the church to make such a request here;
   seeing he had, in the preceding verse, enjoined her to cause him to
   hear her voice; that is, to preach his gospel, set forth the glory of
   his person, and open the treasure of grace to souls; which to perform
   aright, she knew that she was unable of herself; for who indeed is
   sufficient for these things? for even those who are furnished with the
   greatest gifts and largest capacities for such a work, are yet
   insufficient to think any thing as of themselves, much less to go
   through so great a work; but their sufficiency is of God; and therefore
   the church here desires the presence of Christ with her, and that
   speedily, in order to do it: it is as if she should say, I am very
   willing to be found faithful and diligent in the discharge of this
   work, which thou hast called me to; but I am not able to perform it
   myself; do thou therefore hasten to my assistance, and grant me thy
   presence, "without which I can do nothing;" and this also Christ knows
   full well, and therefore he has promised his ministering servants to be
   with them always in their work, even unto the end of the world. Or
   else, 3. This petition of hers may regard the spreading of the gospel
   over all the nations of the world: the gospel shall not only be
   preached to all nations, but this precious box of ointment being
   opened, the savor of Christ's knowledge shall be diffused in every
   place: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the
   waters cover the sea, Isaiah 11:9, multitudes of souls shall be
   converted to Christ, and made subject to the scepter of his grace;
   those voices shall then be heard in heaven, that is, in the church
   below (Rev. 11:15), the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms
   of our Lord, and of his Christ: those nations which before were
   comparable to lions dens, and the mountains of the leopards, may now be
   called the mountains of spices, for their fragrancy and fruitfulness;
   on which Christ appears in his glory; the time being come that the
   prophecy should be fulfilled (Zech. 14:9), and the Lord shall be king
   over all the earth; in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name
   one; what can be more desirable to the saints than this? no wonder the
   church should be so importunate in her request. Though, 4. I rather
   think, that she intends the second coming of Christ; as the Old
   Testament saints breathed after his first coming, so New Testament
   saints earnestly desire his second coming; they love it, they long for
   it, they pray for it; nay, as the apostle Peter says (2 Peter 3:12),
   they are hasting to it, that is, "they desire Christ to hasten it;"
   they do not care how soon that day comes; for though it will be awful
   and terrible to the wicked, yet it will be much to their profit and
   advantage; for Christ "will appear a second time without sin unto
   salvation:" his first appearance was "in the likeness of sinful flesh,"
   and with all the sins of his people charged upon him; for which he made
   satisfaction to justice, and thereby procured eternal salvation for
   them; but his next appearance will be without any sin at all, in any
   sense whatever, being fully discharged from all, as the head, surety
   and representative of his people; when he will put them into the actual
   possession of that salvation he before procured. Now it may be
   observed, that this is the last petition of the church's; she closes
   the song with it, as John does his book of the Revelation; "surely I
   come quickly," says Christ; "Amen," says John, "even so come, Lord
   Jesus:" from whence we may observe, that the coming of Christ to take
   his people to himself, that where he is, there they may be also, is the
   completion of all believers prayers and joys; when this is obtained,
   they have no more to ask for, nor any more indeed do they want; it may
   be said of them then, what is said of David in the 72d Psalm; which
   whole Psalm regards the glory and peace of Christ's everlasting
   kingdom; "the prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended;" that is,
   all his wishes are granted, and his requests fulfilled, when this is
   effected. But now let us consider a little more particularly the
   several phrases, by which the church expresses her desire for the
   coming of Christ. And,

   1st, She says, "Make haste, my beloved:" not that she desired him to
   come before the time appointed of the Father: for as there was a set
   time, which is called "the fullness of time," which was agreed upon for
   Christ's coming in the flesh; so there is a time fixed and determined,
   for his second coming; as the person, so "the day is appointed by God,
   in the which he will judge the world in righteousness;" though "of that
   day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in
   heaven, neither the Son," as he is man, "but the Father;" therefore it
   is both vain and sinful for persons curiously to inquire into it, and
   bold and daring to attempt the fixing of it; for "it is not for us to
   know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own
   power." Now Christ will not come before, nor will he stay longer than
   this time appointed; and this his church knew; nor does she desire him
   to come sooner; yet could be glad to see those things accomplished
   which must precede it; such as the conversion of the Jews, and the
   bringing in the fullness of the Gentiles; all which the Lord will
   hasten, but it will be in "his own time:" nor does the church mean any
   other; but by using this expression, she signifies the earnestness of
   her desire to have this accomplished, being as it were impatient until
   it was done; her language is much like Sisera's mother's, who said
   concerning him, "Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the
   wheels of his chariots?" Moreover it may be observed, that the word
   here translated, "make haste," may be rendered, "flee away;" [1037] the
   meaning of which is, not that the church desired to remove or depart
   from her; no, she valued his presence at another rate than to desire
   him to withdraw from her; those indeed who prefer their lusts, their
   pleasures, their profits, their swine before Christ, say, depart from
   us; but as for the church, when she has found him, she holds him fast,
   and will "not let him go:" so that when she desires him to "flee away,"
   something else must be understood; which is, that she being weary of a
   sinful and troublesome world, breathed after an everlasting rest with
   him upon the spicy mountains; and therefore she would have him remove
   from his garden below, where he was, and take her along with him to
   glory; where she might eternally enjoy him, without any disturbance or
   molestation.

   2dly, She desires that he would be "like a roe or a young hart upon the
   mountains of spices;" for what reasons Christ may be compared "to a roe
   or a young hart," has been shown on chapter 2:9. Her meaning here is,
   that he would come quickly and speedily, and be as swift in his motion
   as the roe or young hart, and flee as swift as they; [1038] which run
   upon the mountains, and other high places, where they delight to skip
   and leap (see Hab. 3:19), and by these "mountains of spices," we are
   not to understand mount Moriah, and the temple built upon it, as R.
   Solomon Jarchi interprets them; but rather, the mountains of Zion, or
   the several congregations and churches, where she desired his gracious
   presence until his second coming; which may be compared to mountains
   for their height and sublimity, being established and exalted above all
   others (Isa. 2:2), as well as for their permanence and immoveableness;
   for, "they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which can
   never be removed, but abideth for ever," Psalm 125:1, and may be called
   "mountains of spices," because of those precious plants which grow
   there; and those fragrant cruces with which they abound; as well as
   those sweet-smelling sacrifices of prayer and praise, which are there
   offered up. Though I rather think, that the joys and glories of the
   heavenly state are here intended; where the church desires to have
   everlasting and uninterrupted communion with her beloved, and that
   speedily, if it was his will; where she should be on high, and out of
   the reach of every snare and every enemy; where she would be safe,
   secure and immove-able, and in the possession of pleasures that will
   never end. For, 1. These mountains may denote the height and sublimity
   of this happy state; It is above, it is an "inheritance reserved in
   heaven; a hope laid up there, a prize of the high calling of God Christ
   Jesus." 2. May express the permanence and everlastingness thereof: it
   is a "city which hath foundations," and these immoveable; it is a
   "building of God, eternal in the heavens;" these habitations are
   everlasting, from whence there never will be a remove. 3. May signify
   the exceeding pleasantness and delightfulness thereof: that state may
   well be represented by spicy mountains, seeing in the presence of
   Christ there "is fullness of joy, and at his right hand there are
   pleasures for evermore;" no wonder then that the church should so
   passionately wish for the enjoyment of this happiness; and close this
   song in the manner she does, saying, "Make haste, my beloved, and be
   thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of spices."
