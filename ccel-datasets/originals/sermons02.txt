SERMON I.

  CHRIST THE HEALING OF MANKIND.

    ST. JOHN i. 14.

   "The Word was made flesh."

   SUCH is the Catholic Faith touching the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus
   Christ--a doctrine defined by the Holy Ghost, and declared by the
   beloved disciple; such was the prophecy of Isaiah--"Behold, a virgin
   shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call his name Immanuel;" [1]
   such was the salutation of the angel Gabriel--"Hail, thou that art
   highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
   . . . . . . The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the
   Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which
   shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God:" [2] such is the
   witness of the apostles--"God was manifest in the flesh." [3]
   Again--"In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily." [4] So
   the Church confesses: "For the right faith is, that we believe and
   confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and man;
   God, of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and
   man, of the substance of His mother, born in the world: perfect God and
   perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting: equal to
   the Father as touching His Godhead; and inferior to the Father as
   touching His manhood: who although He be God and man, yet He is not
   two, but one Christ: one, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh,
   but by taking of the manhood into God: one altogether; not by confusion
   of substance, but by unity of person; for as the reasonable soul and
   flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ."

   Now, in this mystery there are two cardinal points: the one, the
   integrity of the two natures; the other, the unity of the one person.
   The Word which is the Eternal Son, begotten from everlasting, the very
   and Eternal God, of one substance with the Father, having in Himself
   all the attributes, powers, and perfections of the Divine
   nature--without ceasing to be God was made man, of the substance of
   flesh and blood, and took to Himself our nature, with all its
   endowments and properties of soul and body; "so that two whole and
   perfect natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood, were joined
   together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ,
   very God and very man." Wherefore "God was in Christ," not as when He
   appeared in angelic forms to Abraham and to Israel; nor as He was in
   the prophets by vision and revelation; nor as He is in us by presence
   and fellowship: but the man Jesus Christ Himself was God. They that saw
   Him saw God; they that spake with Him spake with God; they whom He
   touched and breathed upon, felt the touch and the breath of God. "That
   which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen
   with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled,
   of the Word of life (for the life was manifested, and we have seen it,
   and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with
   the Father, and was manifested unto us); that which we have seen and
   heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us:
   and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus
   Christ." [5]

   Such is this great mystery, which we can hardly enunciate, and having
   enunciated can do little more than adore in silence. Let us, how ever,
   gather such lights as Holy Scripture gives us for the better
   understanding of the wisdom which is hid in it.

   Gainsayers of the Catholic Faith have set themselves chiefly against
   this dogma, which is the corner-stone of the gospel. They have been
   wont to object to the mystery of the Incarnation, not only as a thing
   incredible in the manner of its fulfilment, but as unnecessary and
   circuitous--that is, inconsistent with the directness of the power and
   operations of God. "Why," they say, "need the Son of God be made man?
   What connexion has this with our salvation? Why could not man be
   redeemed by the simple exercise of Almighty power in forgiving,
   cleansing, and raising him from the dead, or in abolishing at once the
   power of sin and death, so that he should no longer either sin or die?"

   Let us consider what answer the doctrine of Faith gives to these
   questions. It is this: that according to the revelation made to us of
   the character and kingdom of God, and of the nature and conditions of
   man, there appears no other way by which we could be saved but by the
   manifestation of God in the flesh.

   1. For, first, although it is most true that God might, in His almighty
   power, destroy the sinful race of mankind, and create another all holy
   in its stead; or separate the taint of sin and the power of death from
   our nature, and abolish them altogether; yet we must not forget that
   God is not Power alone, but Holiness, Wisdom, Justice. There are deeper
   necessities in the perfections of the Divine mind, and the laws of the
   spiritual world, which are the expressions of those perfections, than
   we can penetrate. Sin and death are antagonists and contradictions of
   the righteousness and immortality of God, which need, it may be, deeper
   operations of the Divine hand than a simple exercise of power. Sin and
   death are not realities existing in themselves, apart from beings whom
   God has made, but are a condition of the creatures of God, privations
   of holiness and life; they are negations, having no separate existence.
   Man is sinful, because righteousness has departed from him; and mortal,
   because with righteousness life also departed. The salvation of man,
   then, is the restoration of righteousness and immortality--the
   expulsion of sin and death, by the infusion of their natural and
   distinctive opposites of holiness and life. But as man, who has fallen
   under the power of sin and death, is a moral and responsible creature,
   and as his fall from God was through the misdirected energies of his
   moral powers, so the restoration of man, it may be, can only be
   effected through the same means, and under the same conditions; and
   therefore it may be that the immutable justice of God's kingdom demands
   no less than the atonement of a Person. We are so greatly ignorant of
   the original springs of right and wrong, life and death, and of the
   laws which inform a mind of infinite perfection, that we cannot,
   without the highest presumption, doubt that there was no other way to
   abolish the moral causes of separation between God and man, but by One
   who should harmonise the laws and conditions of such a redemption in
   His own Person; in a word, that it needed not a bare exertion of
   Omnipotence, but an economy and dispensation of moral agencies in
   harmony with the nature of God and of man, co-ordinate with the scheme
   of the Divine kingdom and of human probation--that is, the intervention
   of a Personal Redeemer.

   2. Again, sin and death had power in and over the personal nature of
   mankind. It was from this we had need to be redeemed. Though the laws
   of God's kingdom were never so fully satisfied, yet our nature would be
   our destruction: "to be carnally minded is death." The first sin, as it
   deprived Adam of the righteousness of grace, so by consequence it threw
   his nature into corruption; and that corruption is derived to us; and
   is in every one born into the world; and infects the first motions of
   the will, which, as they pass through the lusts of the flesh, become
   biassed and distorted. Even though the kingdom of God had nothing
   against us, we should die, each one of us, by our own inherent
   mortality. No man could break the yoke of death from off his own neck;
   much less redeem mankind. Our very nature itself needed to be purged
   and restored to the conditions of immortality. There must be a work of
   life counteracting the work of death, and propagating life throughout
   the race of mankind, as death has been propagated to us from Adam. And
   for this cause, the Person who should undertake the salvation of
   mankind must assume to Himself our humanity, that is, the very nature
   which He was to heal and to save; and put Himself into personal
   relation to us. So St. Paul argues: "Forasmuch, then, as the children
   are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of
   the same." [6] We imposed on Him that necessity. The fall of our nature
   was the producing cause of His incarnation: because we are men,
   therefore for us men, and for our salvation, He was made Man.

   3. And, once more: as this burden of our humanity is too great for any
   of us to bear without falling, no created and finite being, either man
   or angel, could so assume it as to raise it from its fall, restore its
   imperfections, and sustain it in strength and mastery over the powers
   of sin. Angels fell from their first estate, not man alone; both need
   either the grace of redemption or the grace of perpetual support. Even
   angels "that excel in strength" stand stedfast in the power of God. In
   Him is their life, energy, and power. Without Him they would be as we
   are. They can render to God nothing but what they owe. They can
   minister, at His bidding, to those that shall be heirs of salvation;
   but to save is a work too near akin to creation for any but God to
   accomplish. Our humanity needed to be strengthened and hallowed: of
   fleshly, to be again made spiritual; of mortal, to be raised above the
   power of death; of outcast from God, to be united to Him again. So
   closely, indeed, are we knit to Him, that St. Peter does not fear to
   say that we are made "partakers of the Divine nature." [7] Therefore He
   must needs "by Himself purge our sins." None but He that in the
   beginning said, "Let us make man in our image," [8] could restore again
   to man the image of God.

   So far, then, as we can reason upon things the very terms of which
   transcend our understanding it seems that the intrinsic necessities of
   God's kingdom, and of man's fallen state, require a redemption which is
   wrought by a Person who is able to fulfil the requirements of the
   Divine Law, and to perfect in Himself the redeemed nature of mankind.
   And what is this but the Catholic doctrine of the Incarnation? which
   is, that the Word, the second Person of the ever-blessed Trinity, took
   upon Him, not by way of nature, but of miracle, our manhood, "of the
   substance of the Virgin Mary His Mother, without spot of sin;" and in
   that nature He sanctified our humanity, fulfilled the perfect will of
   God, bare our sins in His own body, and by death destroyed him that had
   the power of death. That which as God He could not suffer, He became
   man that He might undergo. The impassible, eternal God was made flesh,
   that in the flesh He might endure all that sin had brought upon
   mankind. His Person was capable of the whole mystery of the fall, sin
   only excepted.

   But here two questions have been asked. One, Why need He to have taken
   a body of a human mother, instead of creating one for Himself? And the
   other, How, if human nature be corrupt, and if the Son of God took on
   Him that very nature, did He escape the original sin which is in us?

   To these the answer is direct and easy. It is the very same that the
   Catholic Church made to the heresy of Arius, in defence of Christ's
   true Godhead. To the first it must be said, It was necessary that He
   should partake of our very nature. Had He taken a body created, as in
   the beginning, from the dust, it would have been a like nature, but not
   the same. It would have been a second creation of another and a new
   humanity; and His person would not have been partaker in the very flesh
   and blood derived to us from the first Adam, for the redemption of
   which the Word was made flesh. It was necessary that He should be
   united to us in our own humanity, that the grace of His Incarnation
   might be communicated to mankind. God, who is the Origin of all being,
   the Creator of all things that are, does not destroy any work He once
   has made, but raises it from its fall, and heals it of its wounds and
   diseases. Therefore He took our very nature, that He might restore it
   in Himself to its original purity. That very humanity in which the
   first Adam was created is the same in which the Second was incarnate.
   There was no other way, than either to create a new nature, which would
   not be our own, or to restore the old, in which we are fallen and dead.

   And to the second question the answer is, that in taking our nature, He
   took it without spot of sin; for He took it not by the way of natural
   descent, but by a miracle, which broke through the transmission of the
   original fault. Isaac and John Baptist, though born by miracle, were,
   nevertheless, conceived and born in sin. Eve was made from the side of
   Adam; Adam was made of the dust; both by miracle and without sin. The
   second Adam was made by the operation of the Holy Ghost, of the
   substance of a pure virgin. He was born in a way of which our
   regeneration is a shadow, "not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
   nor of the will of man, but of God." [9] And, again, from the mystery
   of the conception, that pure substance which He took was so united to
   His Divine Person that it was hallowed and sinless, in like manner as
   the flesh of Adam when God created him and filled him with His own
   Divine presence. From the moment of His birth every motion of His human
   soul and flesh was sinless and pure; every inclination of His will was
   holy. He had all the powers, affections, capacities of our nature,
   filled with more than original righteousness, with the holiness of God.
   Yet He was very man, with all our sinless infirmities, susceptible of
   temptation, sorrow, hunger, thirst, weariness, solitude, weeping, fear,
   and death. And what are all these but properties of man by creation,
   not by the fall? They were in our first father before he sinned; and in
   them is no sin. In Christ man was exalted above the state of creation,
   and united to God by a bond of personal and substantial unity. The
   second Adam not only restored in Himself the losses of the first, but
   endowed the nature of man with new gifts of Divine perfection. "The
   first man was of the earth earthy, the second man is the Lord from
   heaven;" "the beginning"--that is, the originating principle and
   productive life of the new "creation of God." [10]

   Now, this supreme doctrine of the faith throws light upon two other
   doctrines closely related to it.

   And, first, it shews us what is the true nature of original sin. It is
   "the fault and corruption of the nature of every man that naturally is
   engendered of the offspring of Adam." This, therefore, could not reach
   to the manhood of our Lord, because, though born in our nature, He was
   not "naturally engendered," but "conceived by the Holy Ghost." Adam, by
   sinning, forfeited his original righteousness,--the grace of God's
   presence, whereby he was sanctified: through loss of this gift his
   nature became faulty and corrupt; and through this fault and corruption
   inclined to evil. We are born with this fault and corruption, whereby
   we are by nature inclined to evil. The human will, acting under the
   conditions of this inclination, tends universally and by its own free
   choice to fulfil the lusts of the flesh, and becomes itself carnal; and
   "the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the
   law of God, neither indeed can be;" [11] wherefore "it deserveth God's
   wrath and damnation." Such is our first birth into this world: "that
   which is born of the flesh is flesh." And in this inheritance of evil
   we were passive and unconscious: the fault and corruption was in us
   before we knew that we were in being. Such as man made himself by the
   fall, such are we who are born from him.

   2. The other doctrine which is related to the mystery of the
   Incarnation is our regeneration. It is the correlative and opposite to
   the doctrine of original sin. So the Catholic Church has ever taught,
   arguing, by contraries, from the one to the other: for example, as
   original sin is the transmission of a quality of evil, so regeneration
   is the infusion of a quality of good; as original sin is inherited
   without the personal act of us who are born of the flesh, so
   regeneration is bestowed without personal merit in us who are born of
   the Spirit; as in the inheritance of original sin we are passive and
   unconscious, so in regeneration; as original sin precedes all actings
   of our will, so also regeneration; as original sin is the root of all
   evil in us, so regeneration is the root of all good. Strange is the
   cycle in which errors run. Those very tokens by which the gift of
   regeneration is manifested to be freely given to us of God, are the
   very grounds of modern unbelief. Men will have it to be no more than a
   change of state, and not of nature; a mere outward transfer into the
   outward means of grace; and that, forsooth, because a passive,
   unconscious child is, in their eyes, incapable of the infusion of a
   quality of good. What is this but the Pelagianism of regeneration? How
   can they defend the doctrine of original sin as the transmission of
   evil to passive, unconscious infants, by inheritance from a man that
   sinned, while they deny the infusion of a quality of good by the free
   gift and grace of God? In truth it is much to be feared that this is
   simple unbelief in the great freeness of God's grace, in the presence
   and reality of spiritual mysteries. And it is to be feared too, that it
   is an unbelief which spreads further into the doctrines of faith. Can
   it be thought that even the doctrine of original sin is thoroughly
   believed? or the doctrine of the creation of Adam from the dust, and of
   Eve from the side of Adam? or of the mysterious Incarnation of the
   Word, of the substance of His mother? or of the resurrection of the
   body? or of the doctrine of regeneration in any sense or shape? For, if
   the passiveness and unconsciousness of the subject be any objection to
   the regeneration of infants in baptism, it is an objection to the
   doctrines of creation, incarnation, resurrection, and regeneration, in
   any form, unless we be Pelagians and Rationalists. After all, will it
   not be found that the root of all this is a rationalistic unwillingness
   to believe any thing which does not base itself upon the active and
   conscious workings of the human soul?--an error fatal to faith in the
   Gospel of Christ; subversive of the freeness and sovereignty of God's
   grace, which it assumes to magnify. Let us not give up the faith of a
   childlike heart for petulant, half-sighted reasonings. "Every good gift
   and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father
   of lights." "What have we that we have not received?" "By the grace of
   God I am what I am." All things come from Him; we are but receivers,
   empty vessels to be filled out of His fulness; passive and unconscious
   till He breathe into us the breath of life, as in our first, so in our
   second birth. This is the very law of our regeneration, whereby we are
   taken out from the first Adam, and incorporated into the second;
   whereby we are made "members of His body, of His flesh, and of His
   bones;" [12] and are made partakers of His Incarnation, and of the
   virtues of healing, life, and resurrection, which go out of His flesh,
   which He gave "for the life of the world."

SERMON II.

  HOLINESS IN CHILDHOOD.

    ST. LUKE ii. 40.

   "And the Child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom:
   and the grace of God was upon Him."

   IF any proof were needed of the true and proper humanity of our blessed
   Lord, we should have it in these words. He was subject to the laws and
   conditions of our nature; He was as truly a child as we have been; He
   grew; He waxed strong in spirit; He was endowed with gifts from His
   heavenly Father, being "filled with wisdom:" His understanding, reason,
   and conscience, were illuminated as ours; "the grace of God," the
   spirit of holiness, humility, love, "was upon Him." This subjection of
   His person to the laws of human nature is again recorded where St. Luke
   says, He "came to Nazareth," being about twelve years old, "and was
   subject unto them." "And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in
   favour with God and man." One of the earliest Fathers of the Church
   says, He came "not disdaining nor going in a way above human nature;
   nor breaking in His own person the law which He had set for mankind;
   but sanctifying every age by the likeness it bears to Him. For He came
   to save all men by Himself,--all, I mean, who are by Him born again
   unto God,--infants, and little ones, and children, and youths, and
   those of older age. Therefore He went through the several ages; for the
   sake of infants being made an infant, sanctifying infants; to little
   ones He was a little one, sanctifying those of that age, and giving
   them an example of godliness, righteousness, and dutiful subjection."
   [13]

   In this passage we have many great truths recorded. One is the baptism
   of infants; another is the regeneration of infants baptized, in which
   assertion, without so much as naming it, their right to baptism is
   affirmed; and lastly, the parallel between the perfect holiness of our
   Lord in all ages from childhood, and the sanctity of those in whom the
   grace of regeneration has its true and perfect work.

   There is evidently a correspondence, by way of analogy, between His
   miraculous conception and our regeneration through the Spirit. He took
   our nature not by natural descent, but by a miracle; we received, by
   supernatural operation in holy baptism, that thing which by nature we
   could not have.

   Again: there is the same kind of analogy between the sanctity of our
   nature in His divine Person, and the sanctification of our person by
   the grace of our new birth. The sanctity of His divine nature prevented
   in His humanity every motion of the reason, heart, and will. The whole
   inward nature of His human soul, with all its faculties, powers,
   affections, was filled and hallowed by the Godhead of the Eternal Word.

   And such, in measure and proportion, it is the design of God that our
   regenerate life should be. We were born again in infancy, when we were
   passive and unconscious, for this very end, that before we become
   conscious and active, the preventing grace of God might begin its work
   upon us. Baptismal regeneration is the very highest and most perfect
   form of the doctrine of God's free and sovereign grace, preventing all
   motions, and excluding all merit on our part. Strange that the jealousy
   which some profess for this great doctrine of the gospel does not make
   them of keener sight to discern it. If we were not passive and
   unconscious; if our will had begun actively and consciously to unfold
   itself, and follow its own inclinations, we should become at once
   sinners in act, and the natural resistance of our hearts to the grace
   of God would be aggravated and confirmed. And this, in fact, we do see
   in unconverted heathen, and may believe of persons who have not
   received baptism, and of those who after baptism have sinned against
   the grace they have received. It is strange, I say, that they who rest
   all their theological system upon the sovereignty of God's grace should
   not perceive that its very highest and most perfect form is baptismal
   regeneration; and still stranger it is that, by a happy inconsistency,
   they act as if they had faith in that blessed truth which they profess
   not to believe; for we find that they universally address children with
   the words of divine truth, and set before them spiritual things, which
   can only be spiritually discerned. To do this without believing them to
   have received the preventing grace of God is simple Pelagianism, which
   such persons religiously abhor. I hardly know whether to say that they
   disbelieve it or no; for though they do not believe it, they so act as
   nothing but faith in it would make reasonable; and that is much better.
   Their practice is more pious than their theory. Indeed, it is seldom
   found, that they do not believe the regeneration of their own children,
   or some thing equivalent to it, call it by what name you will. But
   although they may break the full effect of an imperfect belief, yet it
   is not possible to be wanting in it, or in any measure to withdraw the
   thankful trust of our hearts from that mystery of grace, with out
   serious danger, great forfeitures of blessing, and sometimes lamentable
   evils; for without a real and active faith in the grace of
   regeneration, there can hardly be a true view of the nature of the
   regenerate life. Accordingly we find the same persons incredulous of
   the degree of illumination, conscientiousness, and self-government, of
   which children are capable. They treat them as imperfect beings, give
   them dangerous liberty, postpone the age of responsibility, make light
   of their early wildness, on the theory that it is inevitable, and may
   be recovered in after-years. They suffer the development of childish
   faults, and let their characters grow distorted, and their gait, as it
   were, to become artificial and faulty.

   Whatever may be said of the care and wise instruction of parents and
   teachers who have a defective faith in holy baptism, it must be
   self-evident that all their guidance and watchfulness would be made
   indefinitely more sensitive and vigilant, if they fully believed the
   great grace which God had bestowed upon their children. How highly the
   parental office is elevated by the thought that they are made the
   guardians of regenerate souls! That which is by nature so sacred, by
   faith how much more hallowed is it! There is committed to them not the
   one talent which nature gave, hut the ten talents of God's kingdom.
   They are bound by a tenfold responsibility; "for unto whomsoever much
   is given, of him shall be much required; and to whom men have committed
   much, of him they will ask the more." [14] Surely they ought to watch
   over the tokens of God's presence with their children, as the blessed
   Virgin "kept all His sayings in her heart;" not fully knowing what God
   has committed to them; to what stature of saintliness in God's kingdom
   their children may attain; what large capacities of light and sanctity
   may be in them, even while they are amusing them with toys, and
   speaking of them as if they had no ears to listen. How do they know who
   their children may be? Great as the parental care of the fathers and
   mothers of eminent saints has been, yet how little did they realise at
   the time what they were one day to become! How, on looking back in old
   age, when their sons and daughters have been edified to the perfection
   of a saintly life, must they have said: Who ever imagined what that
   thoughtful and docile child really was, and what lay hid in him? What a
   trust was ours; and with all our fancied care, how little did we
   realise its greatness!'

   If this were indeed the temper of parents, who can say what might not
   be the holiness of families and homes? they would be consecrated by the
   vow of sanctity; ruled by a discipline of perfection. Even parents
   still charged with household cares, and in the midst of the world,
   would in some sort live the life of the retired and devout, and by
   their prayers, fastings, alms, charitable works, and abstinence from
   the world, train up their children in the simplicity and fervour of a
   consecrated state. If parents would only repress the vanity and
   self-flattery which they indulge, while they push their children
   forward in artificial and ostentatious habits, or correct in themselves
   that still more guilty indolence and neglect which makes them abdicate
   the personal office and duty of instructing and ruling their children,
   even so their households would bear more tokens of holiness. But how
   shall this ever be, unless the grace of regeneration be faithfully
   believed and cherished? If there be any one feature that distinguishes
   the homes of the faithful of earlier days, it is the reverence with
   which they looked upon their children, after they had received them
   back from the font, to be reared up for God. What is it but the
   doctrine of baptismal regeneration which has so strongly developed in
   the Catholic Church the paternal character of God? And in the
   consciousness of this heavenly Fatherhood there is contained a whole
   order of spiritual affections, which issue from the grace of
   regeneration; such, for instance, as dutifulness, submission, docility,
   confidence, gladness, a holy fearlessness and filial love; and these
   are in a peculiar manner the basis of the saintly character. They may
   be called the sanctity of childhood: "the measure of the stature of the
   fulness of Christ," of which children are susceptible.

   Now in the history of the saints there are two things chiefly
   remarkable. One is, the depth of personal religion which they have
   displayed at an age when, in these days, we are wont to look upon
   children as little more than sentient and irresponsible beings. We read
   of charity, almsgiving, prayer, self-denial, in children of six or
   eight years old; and martyrdom at the age of fourteen, or even at
   twelve,--the age consecrated by the single mention of our Lord's early
   obedience, and His questioning with the doctors in the Temple.

   The other remarkable feature is, their precocity of general character
   and powers. No doubt it is but a fallacious evidence of this to allege
   cases of early intellectual cultivation. We read of boys of fourteen
   received among the graduates of learned universities, and the like; but
   all this evidently depends on variable states and tests of learning,
   and, after all, relates only to the intellectual powers, which are
   sometimes raised to a very high culture, while the rest of the mind is
   cramped and stunted. I speak, therefore, of the precocity of moral and
   spiritual life; the fulness and strength of character which youths have
   often shewn. They have begun to live and act as men among men, while as
   yet they were hardly in the dawn of manhood. They manifested a
   resolution and collectedness of mind which follows upon long
   deliberation, and is the result of a well-tried discipline. They were
   strong, wise, gentle, fearless, inflexible,--ruling themselves and
   mankind, leading armies, presiding in councils, governing churches,
   controlling assemblies, guiding courts and nations, at an age when, in
   these days, men are still in nonage and tuition. Surely some such great
   and visible facts were originally observed by the Church when it was
   prescribed that the offices of deacon and priest might be conferred on
   youths of twenty-three and twenty-four years of age, and even the
   Episcopate at thirty. And certainly, in comparing the average formation
   of character now with that of men who were nurtured up from holy
   baptism in faith of their regeneration, and in religious homes or
   devout schools of discipline, it must be confessed that in the science
   of the saints, and in the practice of life, we are backward and unripe.
   If we were asked to find a reason for it, I believe the truth would be
   best expressed by saying that these later ages have lost faith in the
   miraculous conception and holy childhood of our Lord Jesus Christ, as
   the type and pledge of our regeneration in holy baptism, and of the
   development of our regenerate life; and not only so, but that a false
   and shallow system of theology has grown up, and thrust down this high
   doctrine from its place. A prevalent notion in these later times is,
   that the doctrine of baptismal regeneration is superstitious and
   delusive; that it tends to deadness, worldliness, unspirituality; that
   the Christian life of those who have been religious from childhood is
   generally tame, cold, and formal; that true Christian perfection is to
   be found in penitents and those who are converted late in life; that
   experience of sin and guilt is the stimulus of personal responsibility,
   and the very life of the conscience; and that the fervour, zeal, and
   activity of the converted sinner is the true perfection of the
   Christian character.

   Now the analogy we have been considering, between the sanctification of
   our nature in the Person of our Lord, and the sanctification of our
   persons through the gift of regeneration, will suggest to us some very
   important truths, which have the force and extent of first principles
   in the theory and practice of a holy life. And these we will now
   shortly consider.

   1. In the first place, then, we may learn what is the effect of sin
   after baptism upon the regenerate nature. As in all other truths, so in
   this, men have gone into both extremes, some making post-baptismal sin
   all but unpardonable, and others, hardly needing to be forgiven; some
   making its soils indelible, some treating it as if it left in the soul
   no soil at all. Now is there not some evident confusion in all this?
   And does not the confusion begin in our not clearly distinguishing
   between the effect of sin upon the relation in which the regenerate man
   stands to God, and its effect upon the inward and regenerate nature?

   Again: when we speak of sin after baptism, surely another and a primary
   distinction is required; for all baptized men have sinned, therefore
   they have all sinned after baptism. To solve this difficulty, the
   distinction of sins into venial and mortal has been laid down. But in
   one sense, and that a most true sense, all sins are mortal. "The soul
   that sinneth, it shall die"--"The wages of sin is death." The
   conceiving of a sinful thought is a direct sin against the Spirit of
   holiness. Moreover, the privation of original righteousness is a state
   of sin: "We have all sinned, and come short of the glory of God." Not
   to be holy is to be sinful; there is no third estate. Therefore all
   baptized men have sinned, in one sense mortally, and that after
   baptism.

   But the distinction, as it is recognized in the Litany, is plainly
   this:--There is one class of sins partly of omission, partly of
   commission, arising from our original corruption and infirmity of
   nature, and from the subtilty and strength of temptation; they seem to
   cling to our fallen nature even after regeneration, almost like
   mortality itself. And these are sins which neither rescind the
   remission of sins freely given in baptism, nor hinder the advance of
   our sanctification; such, for instance, are evil thoughts and motions
   of our humanity, flashes and transitions of temper, rash words,
   wanderings of the heart in prayer, and the like, which are both striven
   against and followed by compunction and confession. There is another
   class of sins which both cancels the relation of present forgiveness
   with God and hinders the growth of sanctification in the soul: such as
   sins of the flesh, evil imaginations, and temper if indulged, habitual
   pride, uncharitableness, and the like. Now, between these two classes
   there can be no third. Sins must either cancel or not cancel our
   forgiveness; hinder or not hinder our advance in sanctification; and
   they will accordingly be mortal or venial.

   It is plain, then, that when we speak of sin after baptism, we do not
   mean those venial sins which the holiest of regenerate men have
   committed. Such sins are, in fact, little more than the remainder of
   that nature which needed regeneration; and their continued presence in
   the soul arises from the fact, that God has ordained our restoration to
   holiness to be wrought not by a single act of His will, but by a
   progressive probation of our own. We may, therefore, dismiss this
   class.

   Of the other,--that is to say, of those sins which cancel our relation
   of present forgiveness, and hinder the sanctification of our
   souls,--this is to be said. There is a distinction to be drawn between
   the effect of such sins on our relation towards God, and the effect of
   them on our inward and regenerate nature; or in common words, between
   the guilt and the defilement of them.

   As to the guilt, this we know, that upon a true repentance it shall be
   absolutely forgiven.

   But our present subject is the parallel between the sanctity of our
   Lord, and the holiness of the regenerate. It is, therefore, the effect
   of sin upon the inward and regenerate nature that we are now
   considering; and of this it has been already said, that its effect is,
   to hinder the advance of our sanctification; and if so, it is no less
   than a direct antagonist of the grace of our regeneration, and a defeat
   of the purpose of God in our new birth of the Spirit: it is a
   resistance to the preventing grace of God, a refusal to be led by Him,
   and to follow His guidance and illumination. The work of the new
   creation is brought to a stand; the capacities and powers of the new
   nature are baffled and thwarted; and, further, the mind of the flesh is
   thereby released from the power which held it in check. From our first
   childhood sin unfolds itself by its own energy, and by the deliberate
   motions of the will, and thereby gains to itself a new condition. From
   its potential it passes into an actual reality; and by act and reality
   it directly strengthens its own energies, and confirms itself in its
   own particular forms, such as lust, anger, pride, falsehood, sloth; and
   having become formal, becomes also habitual; and that raises a twofold
   opposition to the Spirit of holiness. The passive and unconscious state
   of the fallen being passes into active and conscious sin. What was at
   first a passive inability becomes an energetic resistance, an excited
   enmity, and a conscious warfare of the will. By this means the soul
   becomes inflamed, darkened, and defiled. The continual actings of the
   desires, lusts, imaginations, leave soils and stains, and, as it were,
   deposit a crust of evil upon the whole spiritual nature. It multiplies
   its own plague-spots in darkness. And the spiritual being inclines to
   the state and fellowship of fallen angels, to which the regenerate
   sinner is akin both in nature and in apostacy. How little parents seem
   to know what they are doing when they make light of their children's
   early sins! They are doing nothing less than their best to undo God's
   grace in the regeneration of their children, to make their salvation
   doubtful, and their future sorrows and losses many and inevitable.

   2. And this brings us to a second inference. We may hence learn the
   true relation of repentance to regeneration. Those who have no faith in
   holy baptism look upon repentance or conversion as the perfect aim or
   design of the dispensation of grace. They consider it as the
   accomplishment of the mind of the Spirit towards us, and place it on
   the highest step of our ascent to God. And how can they help doing so,
   while they believe nothing of the true sanctity of the regenerate? How
   can they understand that what they put forward as the highest state is
   but the lower; that which they regard as the perfect work is only the
   remedy,--blessed indeed, but, at best, no more than the remedy,--after
   the grace of regeneration has failed to work its perfect work in us? In
   one sense, in deed, all saints need repentance; the holiest, who from
   childhood grow in light and sanctity, grow also in compunction, tears,
   and humiliation: but this is not what we commonly call repentance. We
   mean the conviction, sorrow, remorse, and turning of the adult, after
   falls, from sin to God; that is conversion. Now if there be any truth
   in what has been said, it is clear that the necessity of this kind of
   conversion or repentance arises out of the disobedience of the
   regenerate, and from the falls of those that sin grievously after
   baptism. That which is put forward as the perfection of the saints is
   the recovery of fallen Christians. And the reason why this theory
   maintains itself so strongly and is so popular is, because it is the
   interest of the majority to hold it. The great multitude of Christians
   are in that state. "Many are called, and few are chosen." All are
   regenerate, but saints are few. The multitude are at best to be
   numbered among penitents; and their own case fixes their theology, and
   sets bounds to their belief. What is true of themselves, they think is
   true of all, and true alone; partly, I say, from being bribed, as it
   were, to hold a theory that will make the best of their own case; and
   partly because the very nature of their case must make them unconscious
   of the realities which others know who have never fallen as they have.
   Besides, the tokens and evidences of repentance are just those that are
   most perceptible to the world. They appeal to the ear and to the eye,
   and force themselves upon the notice of men. The zeal, fervour,
   activity, which converted or converting men exhibit are so nearly akin
   to the same qualities in the mind and character of worldly people, that
   they are more easily understood and appreciated. The character of true
   saintliness, as it is most remote from the world, and even opposed to
   it, is least under stood and valued by the world. It is either simply
   not perceived to exist, or it is thought eccentric, weak, and
   unprofitable. This will explain why the popular religion will always
   incline to exalt repentance to the position of the leading idea and
   design of the gospel. But when we pass from the judgment of sight to
   the discernment of faith, we shall see that it is but remedial and
   secondary; that it is a painful and laborious undoing of the tangled
   and stubborn perversity of the disobedient will; that it is, as it was
   called of old, a kind of regeneration, implying thereby the freeness of
   God's mercy, the greatness of the necessity, the dangerous state of the
   lapsed Christian, the depth of the injury done to the spiritual nature;
   so that it can be likened only to the original state of sin and death,
   and healed by a work second only in greatness to the original operation
   of preventing grace upon the soul. All this shews us that the
   repentance of baptized men is as the difficult and precarious recovery
   of those who, after the partial cure of a death-sickness, fall into
   relapse. The powers of nature are wasted, the virtues of medicine
   baffled, and the disease grows doubly strong. A sad exchange for those
   who once walked in white raiment, and were numbered among the children
   of God.

   3. Lastly, we see in what it is that they who have been kept and
   sanctified from their regeneration exceed the blessedness of penitents.
   They have never fallen away from their first estate. The grace of their
   election, though it has been resisted and grieved, has never been
   baffled and reduced to inaction. Not to have fallen into the pollution
   of the world, the flesh, and the devil, how high a grace! How
   unspeakably great is the loving-kindness of Him who has thus kept them!
   From what has the grace of regeneration protected them;--from what
   dangerous familiarity with evil--from what excitements of the carnal
   mind--from what defilement of the imagination--from what obliquity of
   the will--from what unfeelingness of heart! To be free from all this,
   how blessed! To be ignorant of that which must be unlearnt with pain
   and sorrow by all who will enter God's kingdom! From what hours of
   bitter remorse--from what years of toil, weakness, and infirmity, are
   they preserved! And what a delusion is it to believe that the visible
   fervour and zeal of penitents is evidence of a higher state of grace!
   What can their zeal or fervour do in comparison with the unconscious
   strength and stedfast principle of those that have ever walked with
   God? It is not, indeed, to be denied that we do sometimes see in
   "righteous persons who need no repentance" a torpor and sluggishness of
   spirit; but still oftener the world so judges of them be cause it
   cannot read the tokens of their state aright. The depth and inward
   force of true holiness are beyond the world's ken; the calm and unmoved
   collectedness with which they set themselves to the greatest tasks,
   worldly eyes cannot discern from torpor and tameness. Why should they
   exhibit the noise and excitement of effort, whose very nature is
   moulded into unconscious obedience? They do great things in silence;
   and the world thinks that because they say little, they do nothing. The
   haste and exertion which penitents must needs use to make up their lost
   time and ground, has in them long since passed into the stedfast and
   quiet consistency of a mature piety. Why should they "strive or cry?"
   Why should their voice be heard in the streets, whose life has been
   sheltered under the shadow of the Most High, and nurtured into the
   peace and strength of habitual faith? There is in the deep, burning
   zeal of a saintly mind an intensity which the excitement of converts
   can never approach. Even in those peculiar graces which are thought to
   be the ail-but exclusive property of penitents, the fervour,
   self-chastisement, resolution, entire devotion of their whole being to
   God, what is there to compare with the glowing charity, the vivid
   compunction, the perfect mortification, and absolute self-oblation of
   those that are early sanctified? Great and blessed as are the graces
   and acts of penitents, they are but approximations to the sanctity
   which they might themselves have attained, had they preserved their
   baptismal life from soils and lapses. The very visibleness and
   loudness, I may say, of their religion betrays difficulty and effort.
   The movements of nature are easy and spontaneous, and though done
   without reflection, are more truly the acts of the whole being than
   those things which we do by rule, and thought, and with conscious
   preparation. In the one case it has become our own, in the other it is
   a borrowed nature. This is the ripe fruit of holy childhood; and to
   this every one that is born again may, in his measure, attain. The
   holiness of children is the very type of saintliness; and the most
   perfect conversion is but a hard and distant return to the holiness of
   a child. Let us, then, lay to heart the great gift which has been
   bestowed upon us. Our baptism was a change greater than any which can
   come on the sons of Adam, except death and the resurrection. Let us
   humble ourselves with plaints which cannot be uttered, for the sins, by
   deed and thought, which in childhood, boyhood, and youth, we have
   committed against the grace of our regeneration. And though perhaps it
   may be now too late for us--though we cannot make what is done to be
   undone--though we cannot hope to be numbered among those who have never
   fallen from the favour of our heavenly Father, yet we may hope to have
   our lot in the regeneration among the order of penitents. For us, alas,
   the unconscious purity, the ripe wisdom, clear illumination, piercing
   insight, calm strength, meek inflexibility, the patience, the charity,
   the full, consistent, changeless perfection of the saints, is perhaps
   impossible. But let us, by prayers and labours, by word and by example,
   strive to rear up the elect of God, from their childhood, in the
   sanctity of Jesus Christ. Strive to make your homes to be holy, and
   your families to be households of saints. There is one great school of
   the regenerate, which is the Church, and one Master, the "Holy Child
   Jesus." Under and through Him let us foster the children of His king
   dom. And then who can say how broad and resplendent the note of
   sanctity may once more shine forth upon our tossed and distracted
   Church? what virtues of grace and truth may go forth from our spiritual
   sons to heal the springs of life throughout this fallen world?

SERMON III.

  HOLY OBEDIENCE.

    ST. MATT. iii. 13-15.

   Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of
   him. But John forbad Him, saying, I have need to be baptized of Thee,
   and comest Thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to
   be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
   suffered Him."

   OF all the acts of our blessed Lord, there is hardly any which at first
   sight seems more difficult to explain than His submitting to be
   baptized. It was not like His circumcision, which was received in
   infancy by the care of His holy mother, and in accordance with the
   existing law of the Church; nor like His prayers and fastings, which
   are perpetual examples to us; because the baptism of John was but for a
   time, and is now passed away. We shall nevertheless find that hardly
   any one of His acts contains deeper and more direct precepts for our
   imitation.

   It was certainly a strange and incomprehensible sight when He who was
   called the Son of God, who was born by the power of the Holy Ghost,
   drew nigh to receive from the hands of a man like ourselves the baptism
   of repentance. Well might St. John Baptist forbid Him, and say, "I have
   need to be baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?" What could that
   baptism confer upon Him? or what part could He have in that baptism who
   could have no part in repentance? Was it not an act of presumption in a
   man, albeit "more than a prophet," to administer the sacrament of
   penitence and cleansing to One that was without sin? No doubt St. John
   shrank back with awe and fear, as well as humility and self-abasement.
   And Jesus said, "Suffer it to be so now.' It is all well and in season,
   as hereafter it shall be seen: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all
   righteousness.'" There was some law of His Father's kingdom to which
   therein he rendered His obedience, some deeper reason than appeared;
   for St. John then gave way: "then he suffered Him."

   Now, in the first place, the baptism of our Lord was an act of
   obedience to the appointment of His Father. He was born under the law,
   and by circumcision He was brought into the elder covenant. He honoured
   that law by a perfect submission to it throughout His whole life.
   Though greater than the law, and Lord of that very law, He obeyed it by
   observing all things which it enjoined on the obedience of others; as,
   for instance, the observance of the feasts and worship of the Temple,
   and the offerings which Moses commanded. When John was sent to baptize,
   a new appointment of God appeared. In that baptism, as before in the
   command of circumcision, the will of His Father was revealed. In
   receiving it He obeyed a divine precept. It was a part of holy
   obedience, which is most living and expressive when it is rendered to
   appointments in which the will of God alone is the reason of obeying.
   To the Holy One of God baptism was as needless as circumcision; but in
   both the will of God was revealed from heaven, and in both the grace of
   holy obedience "fulfilled all righteousness."

   Moreover it was not an act of obedience and submission alone, but also
   of humiliation. The baptism of John was emphatically the baptism of
   sinners. It was a baptism of cleansing unto repentance, that is, given
   to penitents as a means of perfecting their repentance. The Baptist
   stood by the river, surrounded by a multitude of sinners, publicans and
   harlots, "confessing their sins." Men and women of all characters, the
   most notorious and outcast, the reckless and unclean, pressed to him
   with "violence," to be washed of their impurities. The whole land
   seemed moved to give up its sinners to the discipline of repentance;
   the whole city poured out its evil-livers to this new and austere guide
   of penitents. "Then went out unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all
   the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan,
   confessing their sins." [15] It was an act of public humiliation to
   join Himself and to mingle in such a crowd; to partake their shame; to
   seek the same cleansing, with all the circumstantials of repentance.
   And at that time He was known only as "the carpenter," "the son of
   Joseph." He had wrought no miracles, exhibited no tokens of His Divine
   nature and mission. He was but as any other Israelite, and as one of a
   thousand sinners He came and received a sinner's baptism. This was a
   part of His humiliation.

   And we may further observe, that the time of His baptism had been
   appointed as the time of His open manifestation as the Son of God. St.
   John was commissioned not only to prepare His way in the souls of men,
   but also to proclaim Him to be the Lamb of God. He says, "I knew Him
   not: but that He should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come
   baptizing with water. And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit
   descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I knew
   Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto
   me, Upon whom thou shall see the Spirit descendings, and remaining on
   Him, the same is He which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and
   bare record that this is the Son of God." [16] So manifold are the
   works of God. John came to make ready a people by repentance for the
   kingdom of God, and in so doing he became also the public herald and
   witness of the Messiah. The public proclamation of the Son of God
   sprang suddenly and unlocked for out of the ministry of repentance. Our
   Lord's act of public humiliation served also to declare Him as the Son
   of God. This public declaration was, it would seem, a necessary
   condition to the undertaking of His public ministry as the Messiah.
   Until then He had lived a life of privacy; henceforward He was
   consecrated to the work of the Redeemer of the world.

   There is still another mark of deep wisdom in this same mystery. At His
   baptism the Holy Ghost descended, and lighted upon Him; and in that
   inscrutable unction He was set apart to the work of the Messiah. The
   words of the prophet, to which He appealed at Nazareth as His
   commission, were then fulfilled: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,
   because He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor." [17]

   Such, then, appears to be the true intention and effect of His baptism
   in the river. It was an act of obedience and of humiliation; it was the
   public proclaiming of His divine Son ship, and the solemn anointing by
   which He was invested with the office of the Messiah.

   1. The first inference to be drawn from this part of our Lord's example
   is, that submission to every even the least ordinance of Divine
   authority is a plain, self-evident duty. What the baptism of John was
   to our Lord, the Church is to us. And this cuts off at once all pleas
   and excuses by which men endeavour to extenuate the guilt of disobeying
   the rule of the Church. On the one side we here see John the son of
   Zacharias and Elisabeth, a mere man, a preacher of repentance,
   baptizing with water; and on the other, Jesus the son of Mary by the
   operation of the Holy Ghost, the Son of God by eternal generation, the
   sinless One, the Sanctifier of the elect. What claim or hold had that
   doctrine and that rite over Him? If ever any might have held himself
   exempt from submission, it was He. Therefore we see that no plea of
   intellectual or spiritual superiority, no reasonings about forms and
   externals and empty rites and the like, can exempt any man born again
   through Christ from the duty of submitting to the rule of His Church.
   Now no one openly denies that the Church has some authority, and that
   from God; because to deny this would be to deny the existence of the
   Church itself, and nobody is so far beside himself as to venture on
   this extravagance. The only question is about the limit of that
   authority; and it is in fixing this boundary that men of a certain cast
   of mind do, by consequence and in fact, deny the power of the Church
   altogether. I have said that we are bound to submit to every ordinance
   of Divine authority, and that for this reason: because the whole system
   of the Church being divided into ordinances which are of immediate
   Divine obligation, and ordinances which mediately--that is, through an
   authority ordained of God--become binding on us; or, in other words,
   some being appointed by God Himself, and some by men having Divine
   authority: the same obligation runs through all, and in them we obey
   God. For instance, the apostolical ministry, the Holy Sacraments, and
   the Holy Scriptures, were appointments and ordinances of Christ
   Himself. The authority of the apostolical ministry, and of the Church
   to which that power, with the Scriptures and Sacraments, was committed,
   is therefore divine, as derived from Him: and all those details of
   practice, discipline, and order, which the changes of the world and the
   succession of time have required, being made and ordained by the same
   authority, and in accordance with the mind of the Holy Spirit as
   revealed in Scripture, are enjoined upon the consciences of the members
   of Christ by the original authority derived from Him to His Church. And
   that is the meaning of His own words: "He that heareth you, heareth Me;
   and he that despiseth you, despiseth Me." And St. Paul's words: "He
   that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God." The whole, therefore, of
   the order of the Church--its ritual, discipline, and practice, its
   commandments and precepts,--all, that is, which meets us at this day in
   the system which it has laid down for the guidance of its people--lays
   us under the obligation of holy obedience, for the sake of the Divine
   authority which is contained in the least things as truly as in the
   greatest. It matters not who or what we are, whether pastors or people,
   nor how learned, or illuminated, or sanctified we may be, nor how
   small, external, and, as we say, trifling, the appointment may seem;
   there is the same great law of the Divine authority on the one hand,
   and of holy obedience on the other. As our obedience passes on from the
   Church to its Head; so our disobedience is a rejection of His authority
   in His own kingdom.

   2. Now we may remark further, that little things are great tests of the
   temper and character of men. The least things are often the most
   pregnant with moral probation; the less the particular precept is, the
   more the principle is exhibited: for instance, things simply commanded
   or forbidden without any assigned or perceptible reason, or those which
   in themselves have no particular attractions or inducements: such, for
   example, as the original probation of Adam by the forbidding of a
   single tree in the garden. This is what we are wont to call gratuitous
   or wanton disobedience; the temptation being weak, and the
   circumstances unlikely to promote the temptation. So, on the other
   hand, in the obedience of the Second Adam. It consisted not only in the
   universal obedience of His spotless holiness to the great laws of His
   Father's will; but to the very least, in the "fulfilling of all
   righteousness," even to the baptism in Jordan. In this what humility,
   submission, self-abasement, what pure and perfect obedience of soul to
   the mind of the Father! So it is in the laws and precepts by which our
   probation in the Church is controlled. What a test of the heart and
   temper is contained in the precept of unity! How directly it elicits
   any insubordination and irregularity of the individual will! With how
   wonderful a wisdom is the unity of the Church constructed, so as to
   hold together the obedient, and to yield before the rebellious! It is
   as the net let down into the sea, firm yet frail; close enough to bring
   those that abide in it safe to shore, but giving way for the escape of
   those that resist. "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for
   if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but
   they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all
   of us." [18]

   To some minds, perhaps, the deep spiritual reasons which make united
   worship a high duty and direct means of sanctification, and divided or
   schismatical worship as high a sin, and as direct a stimulant of those
   tempers which grieve the Spirit of holiness, are not so much as
   conceivable; and yet, with their imperfect knowledge of the matter of
   their obligation, they do not scruple at the slightest offence, or the
   most trivial annoyance; or because every thing is not ruled and
   ordered, done and left undone, according to their liking, to withdraw
   themselves from the unity of a parochial altar, or even from the Church
   itself, and to join with those who are in open and hostile opposition
   to the Church in which till then they professed to find salvation. Now,
   what is the secret of all this? It is nothing more than the detection
   of the spirit of disobedience, which always dwelt in them, but till
   then had not betrayed itself. The whole character is told in a single
   act; and the less important the matter, the more mature and deliberate
   is the disobedience. The insubordination of a man who sets himself
   against a rite or a vesture, is very much greater than that of one who
   gainsays a point of doctrine; for the latter chooses his field in
   matters which, if any thing can justify refusal of submission, may go
   farther to do it, than the paltry, trifling, pitiful excuses with which
   many try to mask their disobedience under a plea of conscience. The
   less the occasion, the greater the insubordination. The lighter the
   alleged provocation, the heavier the offence. On the one side is the
   authority derived from our Lord to His Church, enjoining some
   commonplace and indifferent point of order; on the other, men
   professing the matter to be unimportant, and yet resisting the
   injunction. What is this but the most direct and naked struggle between
   authority and disobedience? If the pretext were greater, it would
   disguise the truth. As a test of the man, the less the better, because
   the probation is more visible, barefaced, and instructive. It is like
   the rage of Naaman when he was disappointed of being bidden to "do some
   great thing," and was commanded to wash in Jordan. The probation of
   faith, submission, docility, and also of self-will, impatience, pride,
   is complete. It is a remarkable fact, that an insubordinate temper in
   trifling and external matters seems to have been always the peculiar
   characteristic of those who have little faith in the holy Sacraments.
   The sacramentarian error appeared to prepare the way for contests about
   vestments and postures. And how should it be otherwise? for what can be
   more unmeaning, wearisome, and irritating, than a careful obedience to
   small precepts and appointments which are destitute of spiritual grace,
   empty, carnal, dead, legal, and the like? The smaller they are, to such
   minds the more provoking. But the fact of the provocation reveals the
   fact of the unbelief. It is the index of a scheme of doctrine, and of a
   theological school. The command to wash in Jordan detected the unbelief
   of Naaman. Though he had come all the way out of Syria, with much
   profession and circumstance, to the prophet in Israel, it is plain that
   he had little faith after all. The prophet proved him, as the Head of
   the Church through the visible order of it proves us now.

   3. Another obvious remark is, how great are the consequences which flow
   from these little things.

   At the baptism of our Lord He was proclaimed to be the Christ, by the
   word of the Baptist, by the voice of the Father, by the descent of the
   Holy Ghost. He at that time received without measure the anointing of
   the Eternal Spirit. Surely this is a type of the graces which descend
   on holy obedience. It is a silent pledge to us that the lowly, patient,
   submissive, docile heart shall be greatly sanctified. And so, indeed,
   we find it. Whatsoever may be said in praise of the earnestness, zeal,
   activity, and laboriousness, of those who resist the authority of the
   Church, there is a perceptible difference of spirit and character
   distinguishing them from those who live in submission to its rule.
   Whatever may be said of the active side of their character, it is
   certain that we look almost in vain for the gentleness, patience,
   softness, meekness, self-control, self-chastisement, the largeness and
   elevation of mind, the passive charity, which belong to the obedient.
   The whole theory of life and devotion is lower. I am speaking of good
   and sincere people, not of the turbulent and self-conceited; but of
   those who unhappily have been drawn into the same general school, and
   though they keenly see its faults, cannot bring themselves to forsake
   it. Good as they are, their standard is personal and earthly, drawn
   from their own inward views and feelings, or from the example or
   opinions of individuals of the same school. This is strikingly true of
   those who have been brought up in sects; and also of all such schools
   within the communion of the Church, as have, by following particular
   minds, lost the tone and habit of the catholic spirit. It is not
   necessary to say more than that the very temper of devotion,
   self-renunciation, reverence, submission, which is the peculiar grace
   of the obedient, is by them looked upon and even denounced as
   superstition, weakness, bondage, and slavishness. Their own estimate of
   the saintly character as unfolded in the Church is the best test and
   portrait of their own. We can do them no wrong in believing that what
   they censure they do not imitate. There can be no doubt that the
   principle of submission is peculiarly trying to some minds; and that
   the very habit which makes it unpalatable is that which seriously
   obstructs the improvement of the whole character. It is rarely seen
   that people grow to ripeness of faith, and to that undefinable
   mellowness and gentleness of spirit which is the very character of our
   Lord, without learning the great lesson of obedience and submission,
   even in little things, to the will and authority of others; that is,
   without obeying God in His Church. This temper is either the cause or
   the consequence of their growth in grace. Either way it seems
   inseparable from it; and to lack this, much more to be consciously
   opposed to it, is a bar, no one can say how great, to our advance in
   learning the humility and the mind of Christ.

   I have hitherto spoken only of the direct moral effects in the way of
   self-discipline; but there is a higher condition of our sanctification
   which may be seriously affected by a captious, impatient, in
   subordinate temper--I mean, the direct gifts of grace which fall upon
   the lowly and submissive heart. Like water-springs, the Spirit leaves
   the lofty hills, and gathers in low places. The Spirit of the Dove does
   not descend and abide on the unruly, headstrong, self-willed. We know
   not what they forfeit. Yet so it has been from the beginning. The
   outward and visible Church, since the world entered into it, has always
   been turbulent and disordered: its rule disputed, its discipline in
   fringed, its doctrine gainsayed. Men of unsubdued tempers and
   headstrong wills have at all times troubled the outer courts of the
   Church; but there is a sanctuary of holy obedience into which they
   cannot enter. There is around every altar a fellowship of the contrite,
   humble, and submissive; who see Christ in His Church, and in it both
   minister to Him and obey Him. And they have a peace which is from the
   God of peace. The Spirit of peace, in gentleness, quietness, meekness,
   dwells in them, and shelters them even in this rough world from the
   strife of tongues. They look out upon the angry buffeting face of the
   visible Church with calmness and a stedfast heart; knowing that all
   these things must be for the trial and manifestation of the sons of
   God. They know that at the best the Church in this world is no more
   than an imperfect realisation of its perfect idea; an approximation to
   a type which is in heaven alone. All the struggle, and strife, and
   lofty looks, and swelling words, and rebellious deeds, of the
   disobedient and lawless are no more than must be while the kingdom of
   the new creation is spreading its dominion over the corruption of the
   old.

   Let us, then, never be out of heart, though the face of the Church be
   ever so much marred and smitten by the spirit of misrule, and by the
   sway of disobedience. Let its effect on us be to make us cling closer
   to the guide which God has given us. Let us render a submissive,
   uniform, glad obedience to the Church; to its doctrine, discipline,
   ritual; to its precepts of fasting and humiliation; to its lightest
   counsel; to the least intimation of its mind and will. Let us watch not
   only against openly rebellious motions of our hearts, but against
   vanity, affectation, love of singularity, peculiar ways, habits, and
   choices, by which men are tempted to bend and tamper with, or, as they
   would say, to adapt and accommodate the system of the Church to their
   times and to themselves. Some men cannot even say the prayers of the
   Church without needless and fanciful changes. This is nothing less than
   simple exaltation of self above the Church; and making themselves a
   rule for its orders and doctrines, instead of simply obeying it. Let us
   mortify self in all its forms; not in the grosser alone, but in those
   refined shapes in which it keeps its hold upon so many. How few men can
   endure to be put out of sight and forgotten. All that they say and do
   has about it something subtil and subdued, hardly perceptible, yet
   never unperceived, by which self again comes into view. Even in the
   most sacred things, and in the holiest actions, and with the precepts
   of self-renouncement in their mouths, there is a some thing, not so
   much as a word, but a tone, a look, an air, which expresses in full the
   presence and consciousness of a will not dead to its own choice. Let us
   seek with our whole heart the gift of holy obedience, that in all
   things we may submit to Christ ruling in His Church, as He submitted to
   St. John baptizing by the commandment of His Father. Let us, by prayer
   and self-chastisement, so cross and keep under our likings,
   preferences, views, opinions, judgments in all things, when the will of
   the Church is made known, that we may in all things obey "as unto the
   Lord, and not unto men;" with him who said: "I am crucified with
   Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and
   the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son
   of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me."

SERMON IV.

  FASTING A MEANS TO CHRISTIAN PERFECTION.

    ST. MATTHEW iv. 2.

   "When He had fasted forty days and forty nights, He was afterward an
   hungered."

   THE fasting of our Lord is one of those mysteries by which the Church
   in her solemn Litany pleads to be delivered from the power of sin. "By
   Thy Baptism, Fasting, and Temptation, good Lord, deliver us." Like the
   mystery of His holy Incarnation, of which it is a consequence, it must
   be far beyond our understanding. It seems strange that the Holy One
   should fast; that He who was without sin should use a sinner's
   discipline. We feel hardly to know what we may say of it. Thus much is
   certain, as the Church teaches us to say, that His forty days fast was
   "for our sakes." It was for us sinners that He was incarnate and born;
   that He submitted to the conditions of humanity; that He took natural
   sleep and food; and so likewise that He watched and fasted.

   Again: it was as a part of His humiliation for us. As He took our
   nature, so He put Himself in our stead. He took the condition of a
   sinner; He "was made under the law," as one condemned by it; was
   circumcised, as one that needed mortification of the flesh; was
   baptized with the baptism of repentance, as one that needed
   forgiveness; even so He fasted, as one that needed the
   self-chastisement of a penitent. It was the humiliation of the Holy One
   to undergo all that is the due reward of sinners.

   And again: He fasted for our imitation; not, indeed, in the length and
   intensity of His miraculous abstinence, but according to the measures
   of our nature. His example has all the force of a command. Though there
   were no precept of fasting in the New Testament, yet this prominent act
   of our Great Master, the true pattern of a devout and holy life, would
   be enough. In this, likewise, it is most true that "the disciple is not
   above his Master, neither the servant above his Lord." We may be sure
   that there are virtues and an efficacy in the discipline of fasting
   known only to Him who "knew what is in man." It is related, in some
   deeper way than we understand, to the realities of our spiritual
   warfare, to the actings of our spiritual life, and to the substance of
   our natural being. Whether we can see all the reasons of it or no, we
   may rest assured that by His own example He has, in the most emphatic
   way, prescribed fasting to us; that no one who desires to advance in a
   devout life will venture to disregard the practice; and that none but
   they who dare to slight the example of our blessed Lord will venture to
   speak lightly of the duty.

   I say this, because worldly, self-confident, and light-minded people,
   not knowing of what they speak, are wont to justify their own shallow
   and self-sparing religion by sinful levities on this most sacred duty.
   Let them beware of what they are saying. Either our Lord's life is our
   example, or it is not. Let them choose which they will, and abide by
   the consequences. To those for whom His life is no example, His death
   is no atonement; to those to whom His example is a law, the practice of
   fasting is a duty.

   Fasting is the act of abstaining either wholly or in part from natural
   food, and that for a longer or for a shorter time, either at the
   precept of the Church, or by our own voluntary self-discipline. The
   principle on which it is founded may be stated thus: that as there is a
   religious use of food, so there is a religious abstinence from it. To
   this it is commonly objected, that it is a matter wholly indifferent,
   external, inefficacious; that it savours of formality, false
   confidence, and dark views of our justification; and that it is all but
   expressly condemned in holy Scripture. It is asked, Who fasted more
   than the Pharisees, and what were they? What can he plainer than St.
   Paul's words: "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but
   righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." [19] "Meat
   commendeth us not to God; for neither if we eat are we the better,
   neither if we eat not are we the worse." [20]

   Now, rather than answer these objections in detail, it will be better
   to establish one or two plain truths, on the proof of which these
   objections must fall to the ground. And in so doing, it may be well not
   to quote the examples of saints, as Moses, David, Daniel, Anna, St.
   Peter, St. Paul, and of the early Church; though this, it might be
   thought, would be enough for any faithful or reverent mind; nor to
   bring direct texts, such as "When ye fast, be not as the hypocrites;"
   [21] or, "Can the children of the bridechamber fast while the
   bridegroom is with them? . . . The days will come, when the bridegroom
   shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days:"
   [22] because such modes of proof (sufficient as they are) generally end
   in a question how far examples are binding, or precepts still in force,
   and the like.

   It will be better simply to take the objector on his own ground, and to
   shew, first, that fasting without a pure, or at least a penitent,
   heart, is useless, or even worse; next, that fasting is a means to
   attain both penitence and purity; and, lastly, that without fasting
   there is seldom to be found any high measure of either.

   1. And first let it be said: That fasting with out a pure, or at least
   a penitent, heart, is simply useless, and may be even worse.

   This, I suppose, it is hardly necessary to prove. The objector cannot
   overstate it. There are no words of energy and denunciation which are
   not used in holy Scripture to condemn the hypocrisy of such abominable
   fasts. The prophets are full of them. "Wherefore have we fasted, say
   they, and Thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and
   Thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find
   pleasure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye fast for strife and
   debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as
   ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a
   fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to
   bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under
   him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is
   not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness,
   to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that
   ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and
   that thou bring the poor, that are cast out, to thy house? when thou
   seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself
   from thine own flesh?" [23] Again: "Pray not for this people for their
   good. When they fast, I will not hear their cry." [24] And again:
   "Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying,
   When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth month, even those seventy
   years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me? And when ye did eat, and
   when ye did drink, did not ye eat for yourselves, and drink for
   yourselves?" [25] "When ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
   countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto
   men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward." [26] "Thou
   blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter,
   that the outside of them may be clean also." [27] "Not that which goeth
   into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth,
   this defileth a man. . . . For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
   murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
   these are the things which defile a man." [28]

   There were Pharisees then in the Church of God, and there are Pharisees
   now; men of an ascetic outside, full of darkness and impurity within. A
   rigid system of formal religion often covers a thoroughly licentious
   state of heart. Moreover, they that fast with scrupulous rigour are
   sometimes proud, uncharitable, self-complacent, or indevout,
   irreverent, and secular. All this is most true and fearful; but I
   suppose that no one ever thought that acts of fasting could cancel a
   habit of mental sin. Nay, they become both sins and dangers in
   themselves. Therefore let the very worst be said of fastings without
   repentance, mortification, and charity. They are mere unsanctified
   hunger and thirst, with self-deception. Outward humiliation without a
   corresponding inward humility, external severities without internal
   abstinence from sins of the world and of the flesh, are simple
   hypocrisy. They are not only useless, but fearful provocations of God.
   On this let so much suffice.

   2. And further: what is fasting but one of the means of attaining to
   penitence and purity?

   It is not an end. In itself it is nothing. There is no fasting in
   heaven, no abstinence among the spirits of the just. It is only we,
   fallen and sullied, that need this discipline of humiliation. Fasting
   is a part of repentance. It not only expresses indignation at
   ourselves, as unworthy of God's pure creatures, but it helps to perfect
   our abasement. It is a part of our humiliation: a means of realising
   our own weakness, and of mortifying the strength and lusts of the
   flesh. Now all this will be plain, if we consider what holy Scripture
   tells us of the flesh in which we are born, and of its power against
   and over the spirit which dwells in us.

   Throughout holy Scripture we are taught that the flesh which we bear is
   the occasion of disobedience. I say the occasion, because it was not
   originally the source. The temptations of sin passed through the flesh
   as their avenue of approach; and sin, when committed, deposited its
   evil in our mortal body. Therefore the flesh in holy Scripture is
   spoken of as the principle of disobedience and the source of
   temptation. St. Paul says, "They that are after the flesh do mind the
   things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of
   the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually
   minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against
   God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So
   then they that are in the flesh cannot please God." [29] Again: "If ye
   live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do
   mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live." [30] Again: "Make not
   provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof." [31] "Use not
   liberty for an occasion to the flesh." [32] "Walk in the Spirit, and ye
   shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against
   the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary
   the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
   . . . The works of the flesh are these: adultery, fornication,
   uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
   emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders,
   drunkenness, revellings, and such like." [33] "He that soweth to his
   flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption." [34] St. Paul speaks of
   "purifying of the flesh;" St. Peter, of "putting away the filth of the
   flesh;" of alluring "through the lusts of the flesh;" St. John, of "the
   lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life." St.
   Jude, of "the garment spotted by the flesh." [35] From all these, which
   might easily be multiplied, it is plain that there is an inclination to
   evil, not imaginary and metaphysical, but real and active, in the flesh
   of which we are born; that our state does not consist in a merely
   spiritual condition; that our spiritual condition is subjected, by the
   sin of man, to the power of another inclination or law, which dwells
   and works in the body of our natural flesh. In early times this truth
   was so deeply apprehended that some fell into the error of believing in
   the existence of two principles, good and evil; of which the one was in
   and of God, the other in and of the matter of the visible world. They
   believed matter to be unmixed evil; and rather than ascribe its origin
   to God, they supposed it to have its origin in another being, thereby
   destroying the unity of God's creation, and His monarchy over all
   things. I note this only because we seem, in a recoil from Manichaean
   errors, to have gone into the opposite extreme, and to treat the flesh
   as if it were not the subject of evil at all; as if sin lay only in our
   spiritual nature, and our probation were confined to the workings of
   the mind. If heretics of old abhorred matter and all contact with it as
   evil, we have come to be incredulous of the mysterious agency of evil
   which is in it; and in the conduct of our personal religion exclude it
   from our thoughts. If this were not so, how could we be so ill-inclined
   to believe that the habit of fasting has a real and effective relation
   to the purifying of our souls? How could we slight it as a thing
   external, heterogeneous, and inactive in our sanctification? Many
   people formally reject the practice as a whole. Others are willing to
   admit it so far as to be a sort of public acknowledgment of the duty of
   humiliation: some as expressing, not as promoting, the contrition of
   the heart; that is, as a sign or symbol of what already exists, and is
   wrought by other agencies: not as a means, no less than an expression.
   That is to say, they treat fasting as others do the holy Sacraments,
   not as a means to effect an end, but as signs that the end has been
   already otherwise effected. This is surely a highly unscriptural view
   of the matter. How strained and unnatural it is to interpret St. Paul,
   when he says, "Mortify, therefore, your members which are upon the
   earth," or "they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the
   affections and lusts," [36] to mean, be careful to form inward habits
   of mental religion! And how shallow a knowledge does it imply of our
   wonderful and fearful nature: how secure and dangerous an
   unconsciousness of what we are! It is surely impossible for any one to
   reflect at all without perceiving the relation which exists between the
   habit of the body and the condition of the mind; between the workings
   of the flesh and the qualities of the soul. Besides these self-evident
   proofs, which the one word sensuality will suffice to shew, is it not
   manifest that the sins of anger, pride, hardness of heart, indolence,
   sloth, selfishness, are so closely related to the body that it is hard
   to say where they chiefly dwell, whether in the spirit or in the flesh?
   Does not the universal language of mankind connect them together? Does
   not the natural instinct of discerning the characters of men by outward
   tokens prove to us that, whether we will or no, we do associate the
   bodily and mental habits of men together? Does not a free, or a soft,
   or excessive course of life insensibly affect the whole character? Is
   not the tradition of mortification as universal as that of sacrifices,
   pointing to a truth to be afterwards revealed in the gospel? And what
   do all these things prove, but that the body, or, as holy Scripture
   says, the flesh, is the occasion, the avenue, the provoking,
   aggravating, sustaining cause of moral and spiritual evil in the soul?
   that it kindles and keeps alive the particular affections which, when
   consented to by the will, become our personal and actual sins? It
   follows, then, at once, that an external self-discipline, such as
   fasting, does enter into the means of our sanctification; that as the
   obstructions to penitence and purity of heart arise chiefly out of
   sensuality, or indulgence of the affections and motions of the flesh or
   carnal mind, so a system which withdraws the excitements and
   contradicts their effects must tend to set the soul freer for its
   purely spiritual exercises. Let it be taken only as a removal of
   obstructing causes, and of intimate and subtil hindrances. This at
   least, upon the lowest ground, must be conceded. And yet it is hardly
   possible for any thoughtful person to rest satisfied with this
   imperfect view. The fasting of our blessed Lord was not a mere
   semblance; it was not an appearance, as the Docetae believed His
   manhood itself to be--an unreal action, for the sake of leaving an
   example to us. Though He was all pure, and had in Him nothing that
   fasting could mortify, as He had nothing on which sin could lay its
   hold, yet, without doubt, even in His perfect and spot less humanity,
   abstinence had its proper work. "Though He were a son, yet learned He
   obedience by the things which He suffered;" [37] by that inscrutable
   mystery of suffering He tasted of sorrows, which in His impassible
   nature He could never receive into His Person. He was weary, faint,
   grieved, buffeted, and put to pain, even as we are: and these things on
   His humanity had the same effects as they have on ours. So, without
   doubt, in His fasting. What may have been its effects on the actings of
   His spotless soul in its aspect towards God, we dare not speculate; but
   can we doubt that the fast of forty days had its own peculiar work in
   that perfect sympathy towards us, by which He is able to feel with us
   in our natural infirmities? Was it not out of the same depth of
   experience that He spoke, when, as St. Mark writes, "In those days the
   multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called His
   disciples unto Him, and saith unto them, I have compassion on the
   multitude, because they have now been with Me three days, and have
   nothing to eat: and if I send them away fasting to their own houses,
   they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far." [38] May
   we not say, that He thereby made trial of such bodily infirmities as
   give to the poor, the sick, the self-denying, a peculiar share in His
   perfect sympathy?

   With us, however, fasting is a means of humiliation, abasement,
   repentance for the guilt of sins committed, and for the soils of sin
   which penetrate our inmost soul. To us sinners it is a sharp and
   necessary medicine to cleanse our hearts, to waken and excite devotion,
   to chasten and clear the spiritual affections towards God, and to
   humble our natural pride. These are its first and obvious uses. It also
   helps to form in us a pure and unselfish sympathy with the suffering
   members of Christ, in their patience and necessities, in their
   faintness and heavy toil, in the languor of sickness and feebleness of
   age. It is good for us to see our tables spread like a poor man's
   board; for many go from their birth to their grave and never know the
   taste of hunger. There are secrets of suffering into which not only the
   rich and soft, but even the charitable and pitiful, can never enter,
   except by self-denials, of which fasting is an example and a pledge.

   3. And this leads us to the last point. It may be safely said, that
   without fasting and the habits implied in it, we shall hardly attain to
   any high degrees of the spiritual life. I would not be understood to
   say, that there are not to be found some who never fast, and are yet
   purer and more penitent than some who do: that is very certain. Some
   who fast seem not at all the better: rather, as has been said, they
   seem to grow less gentle, less self-mistrusting, less charitable,--more
   high-toned in their professions, projects, and censures.

   Again: some who have never been taught to look upon fasting as a duty
   have gone through life without using it as a part of their personal
   religion, yet are nevertheless truly pious, gentle, and devout. But the
   question is rather to be stated thus: seeing what they are without this
   scriptural practice, what would they have been if they had been early
   taught to use it? Surely we may believe they would, in all parts of a
   holy life, have outstripped their present selves. If they have come to
   be what they are without following this precept of our Lord's example,
   what might they not have attained by a fuller imitation of His life!
   For it is not to be denied, that there are, even among persons of a
   devout life, two very distinct classes. There is one which consists of
   people who are truly conscientious, faithful to the light that is in
   them, charitable, blameless, diligent in the usual means of grace, and
   visibly advanced in the practice and principle of a religious
   obedience. Yet there is something wanting. Their alms are given without
   the grace of charity: their consolations are not soothing. There is a
   want of sympathy, tenderness, meekness, reverence, submission of will,
   self-renouncement: sometimes there is a tone which is even selfish,
   imperious, heartless, or worldly.

   The other class are perceptibly distinct; and their difference may be
   said to lie in the depth and vividness of their charity and compassion.
   They inspire no fear, except that which attends on great purity of
   life; they attract and win to themselves the love of others, especially
   of the poor, the timid, the suffering, and even of children. There is
   about them something which is rather to be felt than defined. We feel
   ourselves to be in the presence of a superior, and yet of one who has
   nothing fearful or exciting, nothing that rudely abashes or repels us.
   We feel to be sensibly drawn to them, and to be thoroughly persuaded of
   their goodness and gentleness of heart. Though we know that our least
   faults will in their eyes seem greater than much graver faults in the
   eyes of others, yet we have less fear of making them known, because we
   feel sure of their tenderness and kind interpretation. Such they are in
   their aspect towards us. What is their devotion, as it is seen by God
   alone, we can only conjecture from the purity and intensity of all
   their spiritual life.

   Now such characters as this certainly seem almost to differ in kind,
   rather than in degree, from the others. They have another pattern of
   devotion before them, and are under another discipline. Their
   self-control is perceptibly of a finer sort; the subjugation of their
   passions is evidently on a more perfect rule; and their devotion has a
   vividness and depth which the others do not possess. Now this seems to
   be the cast of character which is seldom, if ever, formed without an
   habitual exercise of secret humiliation. All that we perceive of
   sympathy and gentleness is the result of contrition and
   self-chastisement before God. And this is wrought in them by a system
   of self-discipline, into which fasting seldom, if ever, fails to enter.
   Without this, and the kindred habits allied to it, there can be but
   little of that recollection of heart out of which comes a keener
   perception of the spirituality of the law of God, of the malign
   character of sin, or of the habitual consciousness of our own infinite
   unworthiness in the sight of Heaven. All these, which are the first
   principles of repentance and purification, are but faintly, if at all,
   apprehended by any but those who use in secret a discipline of
   self-chastisement; and all attempts at such discipline will be found,
   sooner or later, to be most imperfect, and indeed all but in vain,
   unless they are ordered on the rule which is here given by the example
   of our blessed Lord. Fasting and prayer are so related, that in their
   spirit, quality, and effect, they will rise or fall together; and
   fasting is so related to the spiritual cross of Christ, that we may
   believe it to possess virtues greater and more penetrating than we may
   ever know in this life.

   Lastly, as to the particular rules by which this duty is to be limited
   and directed, I cannot at tempt to say any thing; partly because it is
   hardly possible to be particular without provoking objections to the
   principle from those to whom the instances will not apply; and partly
   because, in such questions of personal religion, they who are not able
   to guide themselves ought to have recourse to their spiritual pastor.
   It is but to keep up a delusion, too prevalent already, to attempt to
   do by public preaching what can only be efficiently done, in particular
   cases, by private counsel and advice. I will therefore only venture on
   two suggestions.

   One is, whatsoever be your practice, let it be without ostentation.
   "Thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head and wash thy face, that thou
   appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret."
   There are few that can stand being noticed, without suffering in the
   purity of their intention. Howsoever well they may have begun,
   secondary motives insinuate themselves with a strange subtilty. The
   comments of others, either by way of opposition, or, much more
   dangerously, of approval, seldom fail to produce an unhealthy
   self-consciousness which mars all, and then "verily we have our
   reward." Moreover, there is no reason why we should not carry our
   secret discipline with us into all paths and conditions of life. We may
   fast in the midst of the world, in its business and distractions, even
   when compelled to be present in the midst of its feastings. Let it be a
   matter between ourselves and God.

   The other suggestion is, that we do not venture on any over-rigid
   practice at first. Excessive beginnings often end in miserable
   relaxations at last. Hardly any thing so much deteriorates the
   character as retracting good resolutions, or falling away from high
   professions. Little acts are great tests of self-control, steadiness,
   perseverance. Let us be content with these, and turn it to our
   humiliation that we are neither worthy nor able to undertake greater
   things. Higher rules of devotion are for those that are stronger than
   we. Let us ever bear in mind that all such practices are no more than
   means to an end. Let us never rest till that end is attained. And let
   us ever bear in mind that, fast and afflict ourselves as we may, there
   is only one "fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness," only one
   foundation, one sacrifice, one atonement for sin, which is the cross
   and blood-shedding of our Lord Jesus Christ.

SERMON V.

  THE NATURE AND LIMITS OF TEMPTATION.

    ST. MATTHEW iv. 1.

   "Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted
   of the devil."

   THIS deeply mysterious passage of our Lord's humiliation can never be
   understood by us more than in part. It is full of truths only partially
   revealed; and, from our inability to comprehend them, we must refrain
   from offering too boldly to interpret the nature of His temptation.

   Certain great truths, however, we may learn from what is here written.
   That same Spirit with Whom the Son of God was one from everlasting, and
   by Whom also He was anointed at His baptism, was here His guide to the
   place of His spiritual conflict with the Evil One. When it is said, He
   was led of the Spirit, it is to be understood in the same sense as when
   it is said, He was anointed, tempted, and the like--the man Jesus
   Christ being susceptible of all these, by reason of His true and proper
   humanity. That same Spirit by which He was anointed to preach the
   gospel to the poor, [39] was also His guide in all that it behoved the
   Messiah to do and to suffer for the sin of the world. St. Paul tells us
   that it was "through the Eternal Spirit" [40] that He offered Himself
   to God; and that He was "declared to be the Son of God with power,
   according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the
   dead:" [41] that is to say, by the Divine Nature in which the Son and
   the Spirit are one and indivisible. Thus, through the Spirit He was led
   up of His own free will to be tempted of the devil. It was the onset of
   the warfare which was to end in the destruction of "him that hath the
   power of death."

   There is an evident relation, partly of coincidence and partly of
   contrast, between the temptation of the first Adam in the garden, and
   of the second Adam in the wilderness. The first Adam was tempted
   through the senses, and by the allurements of self-exaltation, and
   covetousness of gifts which he did not possess. So with Christ: He was
   tempted to satisfy His hunger by a miracle; to display His divine
   nature, by suspending the laws which govern our state, to which He had
   made Himself subject, and to forsake His Father for the offer of
   earthly greatness. In the two first temptations it does not at once
   appear in what the sin to which He was tempted consists. It may be that
   Satan sought for proof that He was the very Christ, and that he hoped
   either to destroy or to draw Him from God. His temptations were
   therefore put in a tone of incredulity and provocation, like that of
   the rulers who derided Him upon the cross, saying, "He saved others;
   Himself He cannot save: let Him save Himself, if He be the Christ, the
   chosen of God:" and the malefactor also who "railed on Him, saying, If
   Thou be the Christ, save Thyself and us." [42] These words express a
   great depth of contumely, mixed with incredulity and fear. It would
   appear that Satan half knew and half feared lest He were the Christ,
   and so shaped the temptations as to goad Him, as he thought, into a
   manifestation of Himself, and in ways that would destroy the pure
   integrity of His obedience to God. The temptation lay not so much in
   the particular form, as in the moral character and effect of the act.
   So it was in the first temptation of man: the act was in itself, it may
   be, indifferent; the spring of it was disobedience, and the end was
   death. In this instance it would have been a renouncing of subjection
   to His Father, and a defeat of the ends for which He had become
   incarnate.

   Now, this temptation in the wilderness was a part of the humiliation of
   the Son of God. As He took our nature with all its infirmities, it was
   needful that He should make full trial of our state. As He prayed,
   wept, and hungered, so also He was tempted. It belonged to the truth of
   our nature, and to the realities of our state in this world of sin,
   that He should suffer as we suffer. And this is specially mentioned by
   St. Paul, who encourages us by saying that He "was in all points
   tempted like as we are." [43] It was needful that He should learn by
   experience the full misery and hatefulness of sin, and the weakness and
   susceptibility of our nature: for this even the Omniscient, because of
   the perfection of His own nature, learned "by the things which He
   suffered." What humiliation can be greater than that He "who cannot be
   tempted with evil," should be solicited by the horrible and hateful
   suggestions of mistrustful, presumptuous, self-exalting thoughts, and
   that with the taunts and allurements of the devil? What is more
   afflicting to holy minds than the haunting suggestions or visions of
   evil? And yet surely no such trial was ever so afflicting to any other
   as to the Holy One of God. The absolute holiness of the Godhead was
   then brought into contact with sin, as the divine immortality was
   brought into the neighbourhood of death upon the cross. It is
   impossible for us to measure the intense humiliation and spiritual
   anguish of such a familiarity with the Wicked One. None but God, in
   whose sight the heavens are not clean, can know the hatefulness of sin
   as it was manifested to Christ, or the depth of sorrow and abhorrence
   which was excited in the soul of Him who was without sin.

   Again: this temptation, it may be, was as necessary to our redemption
   as the Passion upon the cross. It was parallel to the temptation of
   Adam in Eden in this point, that as he by falling subjected us to sin
   and death, so Christ by overcoming has delivered us from the same. The
   first Adam was our head unto condemnation; the Second is our Head unto
   everlasting life. Now it is to be observed, that our Lord was tempted
   as a man, and as a man He overcame. He did not put forth divine powers
   of miracle, nor support Himself by divine interpositions. He might,
   indeed, have let loose twelve legions of angels against the tempter;
   but how then should He have been the example and pledge of mastery to
   us that are tempted? His victory over the devil was gained by the
   preparations of prayer and fasting, and by the power of patience and
   stedfast obedience to God. The same shield, and the same weapons of
   offence, we also possess. His mastery was gained, as His temptation was
   endured, strictly within the conditions of our humanity.

   That this conflict was complete is evident from the fact, that though
   St. Luke says Satan "departed from Him for a season" we no where read
   that our blessed Lord was ever again solicited by his allurements. He
   was buffeted and blasphemed by the malignity of the devil; contradicted
   and pursued by the hatred of men; all the powers of darkness were in
   activity against Him; yet we no where find that He was again tempted to
   with draw His obedience from His Father in heaven. Even in the last
   night of agony in the garden, in the midst of exhaustion, fear, and
   anguish, when the tempter might have seemed to have found a season of
   peculiar weakness, he did not appear: his work lay elsewhere; he was
   busied in another direction. He had compassed the death of Him whom he
   could not overcome; he had "entered into the heart of Judas;" he was
   counter working, as it might seem, to destroy One whom he could not
   defile. Now this perfect overthrow of Satan, by a person in our nature,
   is a mystery out of which our masteries over temptation are derived, as
   our falls are derived out of the first transgression. Christ has
   overcome for us; and by virtue of our union with Him, He daily
   overcomes Satan in and through our regenerate nature, and therein
   perpetually repeats and carries out His first mastery in the
   wilderness. It was this great warfare and victory that St. John saw in
   vision. "There was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against
   the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not;
   neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon
   was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which
   deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his
   angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in
   heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our
   God, and the power of His Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is
   cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they
   overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their
   testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death." [44]
   Apostles, prophets, martyrs, and saints, all the members of His
   mystical body, became partakers of His mastery over the kingdom of
   darkness, and over the devil, the prince of this world. So, through
   persecution, and distress, and torment, in the provinces and cities of
   the world, in market places and theatres, in the wilderness and in
   solitude, they overcame the strength and the subtilty of the tempter;
   and in weakness confounded his power whom all the world worshipped.

   This temptation of our Lord Jesus Christ lays open to us the reality
   and nature of our own. It lifts the veil which is upon our eyes, the
   unconsciousness which is upon our hearts, and shews us what is really
   going on at all times in the spiritual world around us; by what we are
   beset, and what are the mysterious powers which are exerting themselves
   upon us. Much that we never suspect to be more than the effect of
   chance, or hazard, or the motion of our own minds, or the caprice of
   fancy, may be the agency of this same awful being who tempted both the
   first Adam and the Second. There is something very fearful in the
   thought that Satan, whom we so slight or forget, is an angel--a
   spiritual being of the highest order--endowed therefore with energies
   and gifts of a superhuman power; with intelligence as great as his
   malice; lofty, majestic, and terrible even in his fall. Next to the
   holy angels, what being can it be more fearful to have opposed to us,
   and that with intense and vigilant enmity, and at all times hovering
   invisibly about us?

   From what we read, then, of the temptation of Christ we may learn:

   1. First, that it is no sin to be tempted; nor is our being tempted any
   proof of our being sinful. This is a most consolatory thought; for
   among the afflictions of life few are so bitter and perpetual as
   temptation. Sorrows, pains, disappointments, crosses, oppositions,
   which come upon us from with out, are not to be compared in suffering
   to the in ward distress of being tempted to evil deeds, words, desires,
   and thoughts. The subtilty and insinuation of evil is so great that it
   gains an entrance before we are aware of it: sometimes it seems to
   glance off by a sort of reflection from things the most opposite in
   their nature; sometimes to be taken into our minds unperceived in the
   midst of indifferent thoughts, and then suddenly to unfold itself.
   Every one who is seeking for Christian perfection must have found how
   thoughts of resentment, pride, self-complacency, repining, and others
   unholier still, sometimes seem to shoot off from the holiest acts and
   contemplations, and again to spring up out of subjects of the greatest
   purity and humiliation; sometimes also in times of deep sorrow and
   depression, when our minds are most remote from any conscious
   indulgence of their own evil. This, and much more which is implied by
   this, will be recognised by all who are seeking after holiness; and it
   is this that causes the bitterest and most sickening distress of mind.
   Sometimes it makes us doubt of our whole religious life--almost of our
   regeneration. Am I not even yet in the flesh, "in the gall of
   bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity?" can I dare to pray? is not
   even prayer a mere profession? how can I approach God with a soul
   haunted and darkened by such a presence of evil? It is, indeed, well to
   be suspicious and self-accusing; for there can be no doubt but that
   most of our mental temptations find their opportunity in actual faults,
   past or present, or in that original taint of sin which is still in us:
   that is to say, in those parts of our nature which are the effects of
   the fall of man, and of our own personal disobedience. But the
   susceptibility of temptation belongs to us, not as fallen beings, but
   as men. Perfect beings may be tempted, as the angels: and sinless, as
   Adam in the garden, Christ in the wilderness.

   So long as we are in this state of probation, and in this world of
   conflict between sin and holiness, it must be so. Even though we were
   made sinless at this very hour, still the power and subtilty of evil by
   which we are surrounded would not cease to approach us, and to force
   itself upon our perception and our hatred. Thus much we may learn for
   our comfort: though we should convert it into a snare, if we were to
   solve the fact of our daily consciousness of evil thoughts and
   inclinations by this truth alone. It is too true that, for the most
   part, we are tempted because we have aggravated and inflamed our
   original sinfulness. We by disobedience have given to it a vividness
   and appetite which by nature it did not possess. Old thoughts, wishes,
   associations, practices, are the source of most of our inward
   defilements. To our natural susceptibility and our original corruption
   we have added an immeasurable range of inclinations to things
   forbidden; and on these Satan fastens. However, we may take this
   comfort: after we have assured ourselves by strict self-examination
   that the temptation by which we are distressed is not the result of any
   act of our own will, we may rest in peace, thanking God for the pain it
   inflicts upon us, praying Him to make that pain, if He sees fit,
   sharper and deeper, that it may issue in an intense hatred of evil, in
   a more vivid consciousness of our own misery, in lower humiliation, and
   greater purity of heart. Any suffering is to be welcomed which teaches
   us sorrow and hatred for sin. In this way temptations are turned by the
   Holy Spirit against themselves. That which in its first intention would
   be the defilement, if not the death, of the soul, turns to
   chastisement, mortification, and cleansing. It wakens and quickens all
   the powers of the soul; fear, self-restraint, watchfulness, caution,
   sensitive shrinking from the least appearance of evil, strong and
   persevering efforts to deaden and destroy so much as the very liability
   to be affected by temptations. So it was with the Corinthians to whom
   St. Paul said: "Behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a
   godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of
   yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement
   desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have
   approved yourselves to be clear in this matter." [45] The very sorrow
   and distress are our safeguard. We should be in danger if we did not
   feel them; and we are safer as we feel them more acutely, and use them
   for our humiliation and spiritual cleansing.

   2. Another truth following on the last is, that nothing can convert a
   temptation into a sin but the consent of our own will. This one
   principle, clearly seen, is a key to nine-tenths of all questions of
   conscience on this subject. The worst of temptations, so long as they
   are without our will, are no part of us: by consent they become adopted
   and incorporated with our spiritual nature--thoughts become wishes, and
   wishes intents. Consent is the act of the whole inward man. So long as
   we refuse to yield, it matters little what temptations beset us; they
   may distress and darken, and even for a time seem to defile our hearts:
   but they cannot overcome us. The thought of satisfying His natural
   hunger, of vindicating His divine Sonship by miracles, the visions of
   this false world, the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them, were
   cast like shadows on the clear brightness of our Lord's spirit; but
   they won no assent, left no traces, no deposit of doubt, desire, or
   inclination. They were simply hateful, and were cast forth with an
   intense rejection; and that because they encountered a holy will, which
   is of divine strength even in man.

   In measure it is so in every saint; it may be so with us. As the will
   is strengthened with energy, and upheld by the presence of Christ
   dwelling in the heart of the pure and lowly; so the temptations of the
   world, the flesh, and the devil, are expelled from us, and lose all
   share in our personal existence. This explains the various degrees of
   power that temptations have over various men. Some seem never mastered
   by them, some seldom, some often, and some always. Of the first we have
   spoken enough. The others will be found in two classes: they are either
   those who, without positive habits of sin, are also without positive
   habits of holiness; or those whose habits are positively unholy. When I
   say, those who, without positive habits of sin, are also without
   positive habits of holiness, I mean, such persons as are pure in their
   lives, benevolent, upright, and amiable, but not devout towards God.
   This in itself is of course, in one sense, sin, because it is a coming
   "short of the glory" and acceptance of God. I am using sin in its
   popular sense, of wilful acts of evil. Now such people are open to the
   full incursions of the tempter in the whole extent of that natural
   sinfulness which is in them. This gives them a predisposition on which
   he acts with daily success. They are open and unguarded, and the will
   that is in them is weak and undisciplined; it has no expulsive power in
   it, by which evil is cleared from a heart that is sanctified by a life
   of holiness. We see such people become inconsistent, vain,
   ostentatious, worldly, and then designing, farsighted for their own
   interests, selfish, unscrupulous, false to their friends, their
   principles, their professions. We are surprised by unexpected acts out
   of keeping with what we believe them to be, and lines of practice in
   direct opposition to plain and evident duty. The key of all this is,
   that they have secretly yielded their will to some temptation, and
   converted it into their own sin; and that sin is their master. We
   sometimes see such people deteriorating with a frightful intensity and
   speed; so much so as to make us remember how awfully the emptiness and
   preparedness of an undevout heart is described by our Lord. The unclean
   spirit "saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and
   when he is come, he findeth it swept and garnished. Then goeth he, and
   taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they
   enter in and dwell there." [46]

   The case is, of course, much more obviously true of those who live
   lives of positive unholiness. Every sin that a man commits is an
   invitation to the tempter to tempt him thenceforward to that particular
   sin. So that every man of a profligate life is the subject of a
   manifold temptation, which is perpetually multiplying itself. First he
   is tempted of his own heart, then by Satan, then by consent he tempts
   Satan to tempt him again in the same forms, circumstances, and details;
   for by consent he has made that his master-sin. And thenceforward it
   becomes, as we say, a ruling sin, which is so seldom broken off that
   St. Peter says of certain, that they have "eyes full of adultery, and
   that cannot cease from sin." [47] They have an active commerce with the
   tempter, a mingling of will and desire with him; and the inflammation
   and power of evil affections become a bondage through which it becomes
   at last morally impossible to break. And how does this differ from a
   possession of the devil? Is it not a possession in all the reality of
   fact and truth? How did Satan enter into the heart of Judas with any
   fuller or more personal presence than this? How can we other wise
   explain the settled, deliberate career of sin in which some men
   live--the perfect impenetrableness of heart and conscience with which
   they hold out against all warnings, fears, and chastisements; as, for
   instance, in sensuality, falsehood, or pride?

   This, then, is the sum of the matter: temptations are no sins so long
   as we keep our will pure from all consent to them; when we consent,
   they become sins, are infused into our spiritual nature, and are the
   first admissions of that which in the end may be no less than a
   possession.

   3. And this leads to one point more--I mean, to the nature and limits
   of the power of temptation. First, it is plain that Satan has no power
   over the will of man except through itself. It must be won by
   self-betrayal, or not at all. This is absolutely certain, and lies at
   the root of the distinction between obedience and disobedience,
   holiness and sin. Next, it would appear that he can have no direct
   power over the affections. He must approach them, as they lie round the
   will, through the eye and the ear, the touch or the imagination.
   Through the senses, the avenues of temptation are ready and direct; and
   all the world around us ministers to danger. Therefore our Lord was so
   searching in His commands to pluck out the offending eye, and to cut
   off the offending hand. The first visible objects which Satan used to
   tempt withal were pure creatures of God, the fruit of the tree which
   God had blessed. So subtil is evil. But since he gained an entrance
   into the creation of God, he has, through the will and works of wicked
   men, framed for himself a world of his own, full of the visible forms
   and suggestions of pride, lust, impurity, covetousness. What else are
   idolatries, oracles, licentious ceremonies, lying books, unholy sights,
   pomps, and wars; or, again, false casuistry, sceptical and defiling
   literature, luxurious arts, worldly grandeur, and the like? And these
   things find their way into all eyes and ears, and are quickened by the
   craft and activity of men already corrupt. This world of evil hangs
   upon us round about, and through it he insinuates the quality of evil
   into the affections, and by them sways and possesses the will.

   And again: we cannot doubt that he has still more concealed ways of
   addressing himself to us. He is a spirit, and we are of a spiritual
   nature. It is impossible to limit or define the action of intellect on
   intellect, and imagination on imagination. There are some temptations
   so peculiar, so sudden, so abrupt in their onset, so contrary to our
   natural and habitual bias, so disturbing and vehement in their first
   entrance on the mind, that we can hardly doubt that the tempter has a
   direct avenue to the intellectual and imaginative powers of our nature:
   for instance, religious delusions, in which he appears as an angel of
   light to the perverted mind. There is, by the common consent of man,
   such a thing as the direct instigation of the devil, which, though its
   means of working may be generally through the senses, we cannot doubt
   is also a work of direct and disembodied evil. Such, for instance, as
   the unaccountable desire to commit great and eccentric crimes; sudden
   impulses to do things most feared and hated, concurring with an
   opportunity unperceived till the impulse detected it. Now though these
   are extreme cases, and such as we are not commonly exposed to, they lay
   open a law, so to speak, of temptation which has place in our common
   life. I mean, the direct power and agency of Satan on the imagination.
   It is not necessary now to go further, or to inquire whether the images
   of the mind of which he serves himself are gathered from the ideas of
   previous experience, or suggested, new and unknown, from without. All
   that we are concerned with now is, to shew that he has no hold over the
   will, nor power over the affections, except through the images of the
   senses and of the mind. And this is a most consolatory and a most
   practical truth. It shews us our perfect safety so long as the Spirit
   of Christ dwells in our hearts: and it teaches us where to watch
   against the approaches of the tempter.

   Let us pray, then, that our eyes, ears, and all senses be mortified;
   that the cross be upon them all; that no images of pomp, vanity, or
   lust may pass through them into the affections of our hearts; that no
   visions of sins past, nor remembrance of any thing that can kindle
   pride, anger, resentment, or any unholy passion, may haunt us; that our
   will may be dwelt in by the will of our sinless Lord, who for us
   overcame in the wilderness, and, if we be pure and true, will "bruise
   Satan under our feet shortly."

SERMON VI.

  WORLDLY CARES.

    ST. MATTHEW iv. 3.

   "When the tempter came to Him, he said, If Thou be the Son of God,
   command that these stones be made bread."

   WHEN our Lord had fulfilled the forty days of His miraculous fast, "He
   was afterward an hungered." He felt at that moment, more than all the
   sensations of languor and exhaustion to which long abstinence from food
   commonly brings our nature. It was a time of peculiar weakness, when,
   if ever, the tempter might hope to have advantage of this mysterious
   Person. When he came to Him, therefore, he took up the words which fell
   from heaven at His baptism. He said, "If Thou be the Son of God,
   command that these stones be made bread." It seems to have been partly
   for the sake of finding out what He truly was, and partly to prepare
   the way for other and worse suggestions. We cannot say how far Satan
   knew with Whom he had to do. Probably he could only gather His real
   nature by the manifestations which were revealed in this world. The
   tempter had, we may believe, no knowledge derived from his own
   intelligence who this mysterious servant of God might be. He was no
   longer privy to the secrets of Heaven; and no revelations in the unseen
   world had made him a partaker in those "things which the angels desire
   to look into." His knowledge, it seems, was to be gathered from tokens
   and intimations given to mankind; as, the vision and song of the
   heavenly host at His birth, and the descent of the Holy Ghost, with the
   Father's voice at Jordan. And here he came to put all this to the test,
   and to elicit something more. He came seeking a sign; and that sign,
   first of all, was a miracle, to be wrought by Christ upon the stones of
   the wilderness, to stay His hunger. But He who had compassion on the
   faintness of the multitude would not regard Himself. They had been with
   Him only three days, and He had fasted forty; but He would not outrun
   His Father's time, or change His Father's way. He knew, it would seem,
   that in the end of His temptation, when He had borne it all, and
   accomplished the mysterious conflict, there should come ministering
   angels to His succour.

   But my object is not so much to enter upon the detail of this
   temptation, and to explain its circumstances, as to use it for our own
   instruction.

   It may be taken as a sample of a class of temptations to which some of
   us are especially liable. In our Lord's hunger we may see a type of the
   straits and necessities into which we sometimes fall in our worldly
   condition; and in the temptation of Satan an example of the unlawful
   and indirect ways in which men are tempted to escape from them. In one
   word, it may be taken as a sample of the temptations which beset those
   who have the part of Martha, who live in the world, charged with its
   temporal duties and cares, who have to provide for their own living,
   and for the support of others who belong to them. Our Lord's conduct is
   an example of trust in the providential care of God, and of the duty of
   abstaining from all unsanctioned ways of providing for ourselves. We
   will go on to consider this subject somewhat more fully.

   1. And first of all, this shews us the sin of seeking our livelihood in
   any unlawful ways. This is a subject on which the consciences of men
   are sometimes strangely blind. The pressure of want, the encumbrances
   and difficulties of an embarrassed fortune, the needs of others that
   depend on them, are very strong and urgent reasons for great and
   laborious efforts to obtain a maintenance in the world. And these are
   often much increased in the case of those who are, or have been,
   richer, whose birth lifts them above the lower kinds of employment and
   of temptation, and over whom the habits and expectations of society
   cast a powerful influence. What is more strongly felt and declared than
   that--"A man must live; I cannot afford to throw away any means of
   subsistence, or any office of emolument. If I could do so in my own
   person, I cannot for the sake of others. If I had nobody to think of
   but myself, I might withdraw from this, or abandon that, employment.
   Besides, the Bible tells us, If any provide not for his own, and
   specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is
   worse than an infidel.' [48] It is not more a duty of reason than of
   religion."

   Let it be observed, I am not speaking of acts of direct
   robbery,--stealing, fraud, peculation, nor of the ruder or more naked
   forms of dishonesty by which needy men are often tempted to seek their
   living in unlawful ways; nor of gambling and living by chance, and the
   like:--all these are self-evidently wicked; but of a finer class of
   temptations. Sometimes men of a high-toned profession in life allow
   themselves to participate in trades, speculations, undertakings, which
   are perhaps connived at by those who execute the laws of the land,
   though they are forbidden by the laws themselves; or they consciously
   suffer profits to be made over to them which they know are not their
   due. They let others make mistakes against themselves with out setting
   them right; they leave them under false impressions of the value of
   things which pass between them by way of sale; they let mistaken
   notions, arising from their own words, remain uncorrected; or by acts
   they imply, in matters of business, what they would not say. They are
   willing to be parties, if it so happen, to unequal bar gains; or they
   are not considerate of the quality of those they treat with, or of
   their ability to protect themselves; or they conceal knowledge which
   would change the whole intention of those they deal with, while they
   themselves act upon it. Many of these things have no distinct names.
   They are practised--I will not say, permitted--in commerce and trade by
   a sort of lax interpretation of duty; and though not pronounced to be
   fair, are nevertheless treated as if they were the necessary fortunes
   of offensive and defensive warfare, which the buyers and sellers, and
   merchants, and money-changers, and traffickers of this world are
   compelled to carry on and to submit to. The market, and the exchange,
   and the receipt of custom, are perilous places, having an atmosphere of
   their own; and in it things are strangely refracted: precepts and
   obligations are often seen edgeways, or sideways, or inverted
   altogether. Or, again, the finer forms of integrity are dimly seen, and
   treated as visionary, unpractical, inapplicable to the affairs of the
   world; and a peculiar sort of character is formed, which is
   long-sighted, far-reaching, ready, sharp, dexterous, driving,
   successful. All things seem to turn in their direction; and they are
   prepared for every fluctuation, reaction, and change. Now it is very
   seldom that such men persevere in strict integrity. The temptations to
   make great gains by slight equivocations, and the manifold and complex
   nature of the transactions they are engaged in, give so many facilities
   for turning things unduly to their own advantage, that many fall.

   The same may be said, also, of those who obtain the means of life by
   compromises of opinion and of principle, by slight suppressions of
   conscience, and tampering with their own sincerity. All these are so
   many forms of commanding stones to be made bread. They are a withdrawal
   of trust in the providence of God, who never forsakes those who look
   simply to Him, and persevere in their own pure intention of heart, in
   spite of golden opportunities and alluring offers of gain. We read in
   the book of Proverbs, "He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be
   innocent." [49] And why, but because a precipitate following of wealth
   makes men bold, speculating, unscrupulous? They are not nice in their
   measures if there seems a chance of success. They follow up their
   points with an urgency that leaves them too little time to scrutinise
   the means: indeed, the means seem to force themselves upon their hands.
   Many a great for tune will bear little scrutiny or retrospect. It must
   be looked at only on the outside, and under the fair aspect of its
   present appearance.

   But we may dismiss these examples, hoping that they, though too often
   seen, are not of very frequent occurrence, and go on to a more common
   temptation.

   2. We may learn, then, further, the sin of seeking our living in any
   way which implies mistrust of God's care for us. It is most certain
   that, in our lawful calling, we may be exposed to this temptation. We
   may be tempted not only to mistrust the providence of God, but also to
   endeavour to secure ourselves, by our own foresight and management,
   against the surprises of want and the changes of worldly fortune.

   And this we may do, for instance, by hoarding. Now here is an
   acknowledged difficulty. Holy Scripture says, "Go to the ant, thou
   sluggard, consider her ways, and be wise;" [50] which seems to teach us
   that it is a duty to be both diligent and foresighted: to lay up for
   dark days and wintry seasons. So, indeed, it is; and all the more as we
   have others to care for. Yet it is plain that this must have its limit.
   Holy Scripture, while it sends us for wisdom to the ant, forbids
   greediness, warns us against love of riches, condemns covetousness. We
   read: "They that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and
   into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and
   perdition. For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while
   some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced
   themselves through with many sorrows;" [51] again: "No covetous man,
   who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and
   of God;" [52] and our Lord teaches the same in the awful parable of the
   rich man, who said, "I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and
   there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my
   soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine
   ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this
   night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things
   be, which thou hast provided?" [53] Now that which is condemned in
   these passages is a hoarding spirit, which is excited and kept alive by
   a desire to secure ourselves against all contingencies of God's
   providence; as if men should lay in stores, and provision a stronghold,
   against the invasions of God. This is the "trusting in uncertain
   riches, and not in the living God," [54] which St. Paul condemns. Men
   that leave all thought of God out of their calculation when they are
   making a for tune, inevitably shut out all thought of His future
   providence in their schemes for securing the for tune they have made.
   They begin in an unthankful, self- trusting way, and they end in
   relying upon their own prudence and worldly wisdom. This is a mere
   trying to make stones into bread. They are no safer from poverty than
   the poorest: no more secure from hunger, nakedness, destitution, than
   the man that cannot reckon pence against their thousands of gold and
   silver. Both rich and poor depend for the morrow equally upon God. It
   is not in the power of man to make himself more secure. He will have
   just so much as God wills, and he will hold it just so long. A frugal
   man who lives of what God gives him, and disposes wisely of the rest,
   distributing part to others, and laying up such a proportion as may
   remain, subject to such uses and demands as God may design he is safer
   far than the richest, whose yearly hoardings cannot be told: for a
   trust in the Father of lights shall never be disappointed. It contains
   in it the virtues of the treasuries of heaven. Out of these there shall
   be ministered an abundant store, when the money-bags of the rich shall
   be unawares found empty. This, then, is an evident temptation. It is an
   unbelieving mistrust of God, and an over-confident trust in ourselves.

   Another particular form of the same temptation is, to withhold our alms
   from the poor and destitute, under a plea that we must be provident for
   ourselves. There is something shocking in the very statement. And yet
   it is to be feared that there are persons who refuse all applications
   for alms of all kinds, both for the bodies and for the souls of men, on
   the plea that they cannot afford it; that "charity begins at home," and
   the like. They do so in the belief that what they save in this manner
   is laid up in store for their own future security, forgetting that they
   thereby rob God of His due; that they tempt Him in a high degree to
   strip them of the wealth they use so unworthily; that they provoke Him
   to send the moth, and the canker, and the rust, to eat away their
   stored treasures, and to leave them naked and poor. There are, I say,
   some people who systematically refuse all alms, especially those that
   are asked of them for spiritual mercy, for the spreading of Christ's
   kingdom by missions among the heathen, and for the ministry of
   repentance among our outcast and fallen people.

   But we must not limit what has been said to those that absolutely
   refuse to give alms at all. There are others, making up indeed the
   greater part of society, who do give, but upon no rule of proportion to
   their wealth. They give in all forms of charity sums incalculably small
   compared with the outlay made upon themselves, their dwellings,
   families, tables, pursuits, refinements. They stint themselves in
   nothing so much as in almsgiving. When they make retrenchments, it is
   with their alms that they begin. It is here they first feel the pinch
   of poverty. Their charities are cut down first. What would they not
   give to the poor, or to the work of the Church, if only they had the
   means; if only their ability were as large as their compassion! And
   yet, perhaps, they never give an entertainment to their rich friends
   and neighbours at less cost than their whole year's charity. They live
   up to their income in every thing else. It is in the fifth or tenth
   which they might give back to God, that they begin their provident
   economy, and lay up for themselves hereafter that which is due to
   Christ's poor now. What ought to be the bread of the hungry, they turn
   into a stone: and so in the day of their own necessity they will find
   it.

   And to take one more instance: What is the anxious carefulness by which
   the majority of men are beset, but the same temptation? God has passed
   His word that they shall not lack; but they cannot wait His time, nor
   leave in His hands the way. They charge themselves with the two fold
   work both of their own labour and of His providence. And they leave
   nothing undone or untried to lift themselves above the danger of being
   poor. Early and late, by day and by night, waking and sleeping, their
   whole powers are centred in the one thought, dream, desire, and toil,
   to secure themselves from being poor. Now there is no fault to be found
   with industry. Rather it is to be commended; but it is the carefulness,
   the anxiety, the furrows on the brow, the foreboding in the heart, the
   undue magnitude, in their esteem, of the things of this world, the
   faint faith in God, and the habitual reliance on their own
   management--this is the thing to be lamented and reproved.

   It seems as if the Divine providence had a peculiar chastisement for
   those that will not trust simply in Him. Wealth ill gotten soon
   perishes: goods heaped up by unrighteousness waste away: storehouses
   filled in forgetfulness of God are soon emptied: riches not sanctified
   by alms eat themselves through:--worldly carefulness is a spendthrift
   after all. "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Consider your ways. Ye have
   sown much, and "bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye
   drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is
   none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag
   with holes. . . . Ye looked for much, and lo, it came to little; and
   when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. . . . One came to an heap
   of twenty measures, there were but ten; . . one came to the pressfat
   for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but
   twenty."Haggai i. 5, 6, 9; and ii. 16. So certain it is, that they who
   attempt by worldly prudence and selfish forethought to secure to
   themselves the bread of this life, withdraw their faith from God, and
   forfeit His favour and benediction; and in this loss lose all.

   Now this suggests to us what may be called two great laws of God's
   providential kingdom.

   (1.) The first is, that all sustenance of life is as absolutely in His
   gift as life itself. Whatsoever He has created He still sustains "by
   the word of His power." "In Him all things consist." The power which
   conserves the state of the world and the teeming life which is in it is
   His. All creatures, animate and inanimate, are sustained by Him. All
   this we know; but, like all other great laws, it is too broad for us.
   We cannot, though weakness of faith, bring it into the particulars of
   our daily life; especially as in our case it admits of being interwoven
   with the moral action and probation of mankind. There is hardly any
   thing that men so much affirm in theory, and so much contradict in
   practice. It is in the mouth of every miser, hoarder, and worldling;
   yet their whole life is a direct denial of it. When our Lord said,
   "Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall
   drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life
   more than meat, and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air:
   for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your
   heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?" and
   again: "Take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, what shall we
   drink? or, wherewithal shall we be clothed? (for after all these things
   do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have
   need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God and His
   righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you;" [55] if
   our Lord, when He said this, had intended any conditions, restrictions,
   qualifications, to be put upon His meaning, He would, doubtless, have
   put them Himself. What He intends us, therefore, to under stand is,
   first, that we ought not to busy ourselves and to bestow care and
   attention on the clothing and nourishing of the body; and next, that
   what ever is needful God will give us. It is clear, then, that we have
   no warrant from this to look for superfluous indulgences, for needless
   provisions to sustain an artificial state in life, or to keep up an
   appearance which is assumed by our own choice, and out of deference to
   the customs of men or the pomp of the world. But we have a most certain
   warrant to believe that we shall never want what is really necessary
   for us. In giving us the breath of life, He gave us a pledge of the
   sustenance required for it. And this extends beyond our own persons to
   all who depend on us, such as children, servants, and others whom the
   providence of God has committed to us. So long as it is His will that
   we should exist in this earthly life, we have a certain promise and
   pledge that He will, in ways known to Himself, provide for us all
   necessary things. There seem to be only two conditions of this promise:
   first, that we seek it from Him in the mea sure and proportion that
   befits us; and next, that we labour diligently in the calling He
   appoints for us. If we be peasants, we must not look for the fare of
   princes; nor if our lot be plain, must we expect or desire to live
   freely and be clad in soft clothing as they that are in kings' palaces.
   And again: labour is the condition of man since the fall. "Cursed is
   the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of
   thy life;" "for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." [56]
   And this most righteous penalty, like sin itself, has penetrated every
   state of life. It is not the tiller of the earth only, but the princes
   of this world likewise, who feel its power. The ground that was cursed
   is the whole sphere of man's mortal life and labour; all his
   employments, business, studies, callings, undertakings, the whole range
   of his toil in his personal and social state. Care and weariness,
   disappointment and the sweat of his face, are the conditions of all the
   works of man, both in body and in mind, whether he be learned or
   unlearned, whether he be lord or serf, ruled or ruler, buyer or seller,
   merchant or craftsman, teacher or learner, bishop or doctor, pastor or
   penitent, husband or wife, master or servant. To labour and to be
   lowly, to eat his bread in weariness and by measure, is his portion;
   but in lowliness and in labour shall be his rest. God will provide.
   "His bread shall be given him, and his water shall be sure." "I have
   been young, and now am old; and yet saw I never the righteous forsaken,
   nor his seed begging their bread." [57] To those, then, who faithfully
   do the work which God has appointed them, and keep within the sphere
   and range where He has cast their lot, this great law of God's kingdom
   is pledged and sure. They shall never want whatsoever is needful, safe,
   and expedient for their support, and for the maintenance of all that
   legitimately falls within the condition assigned to them by the will of
   God.

   (2.) The other great law I referred to is this, that the most truly
   expedient course is often one which is most inexpedient according to
   the measures of the world. What but this does the example of our Lord
   teach us, Who in His hunger refused to relieve His wants and faintness
   by the speaking of a word? How does the world oppress a man with its
   exhortations to "spare himself," to take advantage of natural powers,
   to seize on opportunities, to reap the benefit of great offers, to shew
   himself to the world, to let himself be made popular, to get on in
   life, and to make himself a name, a house, or a fortune I And how does
   it lament, or expostulate, or reproach him, if he refuse to turn these
   stones into bread! "So long as thou doest well unto thyself, men will
   speak well of thee." [58] But if a man turn away from money, ease,
   comfort, or competency, and the like, he is straightway improvident,
   reckless, eccentric, or ostentatious, fanciful, or proud. Nothing the
   world resents more than scrupulousness in money-getting. It is a very
   searching and wide-spread rebuke. One such man, by one such act, before
   he is aware, pricks the conscience of half the neighbourhood. The world
   cannot endure to be slighted, to be held cheap, to be valued at its own
   true price. Therefore, in self-defence, it keeps up a loud and
   plausible worship of expediency; and because what is right is always
   expedient, by a cunning sleight it sets forward what is expedient as
   the index of what is right. Now, nothing can be more contrary to this
   philosophy than to decline great stations, rich offers, large trusts,
   profitable employments; or again, to make costly offerings, to give
   great alms, to lay by little, to aim at extensive works. But what says
   Holy Writ, that true and only philosophy of human life? "There is that
   scattereth and yet increaseth; there is that withholdeth more than is
   meet, but it tendeth to poverty." [59] There are two kinds of lenders,
   two kinds of usury, two great debtors who take up the gold and silver
   of men--the world and God. The more men invest in the world, the more
   they lose; the more they lay up, the more they waste; the more they
   hoard, the more they squander. It "tendeth to poverty." Great figures,
   vast credit, thousands by the year, and the man is none the richer; he
   is not wiser, better, happier, healthier, safer from ruin, poverty,
   destitution. His great barks founder in a calm; or the mountain of his
   wealth is driven away in an hour, "as a rolling thing before the
   whirlwind." Or, let all these prosper to the full; let all his rich
   cargoes come into the haven, and all his ventures turn in the mart to
   gold, he can neither eat nor drink, nor in any way enjoy, more than the
   poor man at his gate. "He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied
   with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also
   vanity. When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what
   good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with
   their eyes? The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat
   little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
   sleep. There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
   riches kept for the owners there of to their hurt." [60] The world is a
   false-hearted debtor, paying not only no usury on its loans, but
   restoring nothing again. All that it borrows, it consumes "upon its
   lusts;" and all that it gives to its creditors is tinsel, and noise,
   and flatteries.

   Not so with God. The only sure investment for our worldly goods is in
   works of mercy to the poor of Christ. "He that hath pity upon the poor,
   lendeth unto the Lord; and look, what he layeth out, it shall be paid
   him again." "Whosoever shall give to drink a cup of cold water in My
   name shall in no wise lose his reward." [61] The whole history of the
   Church is witness. Who made such gains as they that sold all they had,
   and gave to the poor, that they might bear their cross in following the
   Lord? Who found houses and lands an hundredfold, but they that forsook
   all to follow Him? What was it that brought in the gold and silver, and
   lands and goods of the earth, without measure, to the use and service
   of the Church, but the first great venture of faith, the first full and
   confiding investment which they made in the beginning who "sold their
   possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had
   need;" [62] or being "possessors of lands or houses, sold them, and
   brought the prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at
   the apostles' feet; and distribution was made unto every man according
   as he had need?" [63] It was the voluntary poverty of the first
   Christians that endowed the Church. We live of their usury, and on the
   profits of their investment. The land of Barnabas has borne the tithe
   of Christendom. I am not now speaking of the lasting returns which are
   laid up in heaven "in bags that wax not old;" I am speaking strictly of
   this world. And it is most true to say, that they will find at last the
   best return of all their ventures who go counter to the false
   expediency of this scheming, calculating world, and lay out their
   incomes with a thankful and trustful heart for the service of God and
   the consolation of His poor. When the prophet came to Sarepta, he asked
   food, in a time of famine, of a lone widow, who had a son depending on
   her; both were ready to perish. In her barrel was a handful of meal, in
   her cruse a little oil. Yet the prophet said, "Make me a little cake
   first, and after that make for thee and for thy son." [64] What request
   could be more untimely, exacting, unreasonable? Was she not a widow,
   and her son an orphan, and both destitute? Must she not first care for
   her own child, especially in a time of famine? So the world would
   argue; and for its reward receive an empty barrel and a dry cruse.

   To conclude, then; let us ever bear in mind that the probation of many
   men lies, for the greatest part, in the matter of their temporal
   affairs; in the way in which they seek gain, and use the goods and
   possessions of the world. Their chief dangers arise from the largeness
   of their personal wants, and the scale they have pitched for their
   appearance in the sight of the world. When once men have committed
   themselves too far in this point, it becomes every day more difficult
   to withdraw; and then they are put to all manner of expedients, shifts,
   and schemes, to maintain themselves in their position. This drives them
   into ambiguous lines of business, and into acts of an equivocal
   meaning; slight, it may be, at first, but by degrees enlarging into a
   wide surface of dangerous practice, and into concealed embarrassment.
   Money is the poison of thousands, whose character, in other respects,
   is high and admirable. It is strange over what minds money keeps its
   hold; and how near a man may go to moral greatness, and yet be crippled
   and stunted by this one passion. Money is his measure; and with all his
   gifts and enlarged views of mind, and his almost great points of
   character in other respects, money ascertains the real standard of his
   moral being. Beware, then, of money, and the desire for it, of
   carefulness and mistrust of God. Give alms of all that ye possess.
   Labour in your lot, be content with such things as ye have, and be
   careful for nothing. He who fasted in the wilderness, and for the five
   thousand made five loaves to be enough, is with you. He will feed you
   with the bread that came down from heaven, even that meat "which the
   Son of man shall give unto you; for Him hath God the Father sealed."

SERMON VII.

  SPIRITUAL PRESUMPTION.

    ST. MATTHEW iv. 5-7.

   "Then the devil taketh Him up into the holy city, and setteth Him on a
   pinnacle of the temple, and saith unto Him, If Thou be the Son of God,
   cast Thyself down: for it is written, He shall give His angels charge
   concerning Thee: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at
   any time Thou dash Thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is
   written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."

   THERE seems to be a manifold cunning in this invitation of the tempter.
   "He setteth Him upon the pinnacle of the temple," from which no mere
   man could cast himself and live. He bade Him cast Himself down;
   scheming either to destroy the person of the Son of God, or to discover
   His character and power. And yet he so shaped his proposal as to
   insinuate an imagination of intense spiritual evil.

   The pretext suggested in this temptation by the devil to our Lord was,
   that the Sonship of the true Messiah and the promises of God were a
   pledge to secure Him from all evil. "If Thou be the Son of God,' He
   will take care of Thee: His angels shall bear Thee up." From this we
   may gather what was the evil to which Satan tempted the Saviour of the
   world. It appears to suggest a presumptuous dependence on God in things
   where He has not promised to extend it: and a consequent presumption in
   running into dangers. And this, after all, will be found to resolve
   itself into a temptation to self-confidence. "If Thou be the Son of
   God:" this was the chief plea. If Thou be, all must be safe to Thee.
   Ministering angels wait upon Thee. Nothing can work Thee harm.'

   We may take this as a type of a very subtil and dangerous class of
   temptations; those, I mean, which beset persons of a truly religious
   life. When people have lived for many years in the daily practice of
   religion, and have been long free from habits of transgression, dangers
   of a new kind begin to surround them. Whatever is habitual has a
   tendency to become unconscious, and whatever is unconscious is liable
   to sudden or vehement surprises. The very freedom such people enjoy
   from ordinary temptations, the clearness of their daily path, makes
   them to feel like men dwelling in peace in a country once infested with
   enemies, but now long ago cleared of them. When we are at peace, we do
   not bar and fortify our dwellings, as if we were in a country swept by
   warfare. We throw down our walls and strongholds. We dwell securely
   each man under his vine and under his fig-tree. So it is in religion.
   After a course of repentance, and the hard struggle of conversion to
   God, we find ourselves at large. After the "winds and the sea" are
   fallen, "there is a great calm." It is a blessed state, full of quiet
   and refreshing; full of calm acquiescence in our lot, and of unexcited
   joy in the service of God, in self-denials and prayers, in frequenting
   the offices of the Church, and the holy sacraments. There grows every
   day a fuller persuasion that the point is turned; the great work over;
   our lot sealed; that God loves us, and has "brought us nigh unto"
   Himself; that we have passed from death unto life, and are His sons.
   And all this is most true: Blessed be God. But there are certain habits
   of mind which go with such a state; and to these habits certain
   peculiar temptations are incident.

   I. First, people who are really religious some times trust in God's
   keeping, without considering the limits and conditions under which that
   keeping is promised to them. It is not promised absolutely, as if they
   should be safe anywhere, or in any thing, go where they may, do what
   they will. Neither are they extravagant enough to think so. They know
   very clearly that they have no warrant to look for His keeping, if they
   should go out of the path of duty, or run themselves into temptation.
   All deliberate courting of the tempter they know does at once cancel
   God's promise of protection; and yet the very clearness of this truth
   somehow deceives them. Because it is so clear, they feel confident that
   they can never act in defiance of it; and therefore that this or that
   particular line which they are entering upon is not in defiance of it.
   It is very certain, however, that people someway advanced in a
   religious life do exceed these conditions, and find it afterwards to
   their sorrow, when some great fall has broken their security, and
   filled them with a sudden confusion. It is all then, in a moment, clear
   and plain, as if a veil had suddenly fallen, and their eyes were opened
   to behold their shame.

   II. Again, the reason why they make these dangerous mistakes is, that,
   through habitual practice of the system of personal religion, which
   belongs to their lot in life, they sometimes become self-trusting; not
   expressly, perhaps, as if they did not know that God alone is their
   support, but virtually and by implication. For instance, we trust to
   our first impressions of what is right and wrong, safe or dangerous,
   expedient or inexpedient. We believe our judgment to be as sound as our
   intentions; and that our religion is a second nature, of which the
   impulses and instincts have come to supersede forethought and
   deliberation; that they may be trusted without much scrutiny. We think
   ourselves out of the danger of such temptations as have long failed to
   overcome us: so that either they will not approach us, or that, if they
   do, we should certainly overcome them. A multitude of sins we feel that
   we are in no danger of being tempted to commit. They are so contrary to
   our whole life; to our formed habits; to our every thought; would do so
   great a violence to our in most nature; our time is so much spent in
   reproving and trying to correct the same in others, that we should be
   almost inclined to laugh if any one should warn us against them.

   Nevertheless, it does happen, and that not unfrequently, that really
   religious people fall into those very sins against which they believe
   themselves altogether proof. God in His mercy suffers them to find out
   their self-confidence, by a fall which breaks them asunder. They wake
   up, to find that they have been walking upon the brink of endless
   dangers; that Satan has beset all their path with snares; that all the
   while he has ceased to tempt them, he has been lulling them into
   security, bribing them to take off their outposts and watches; and, at
   the same time, he has been laying traps and digging pitfalls on every
   side, so that they can scarce turn without falling into a snare.
   Perhaps nothing short of a heavy fall would open their eyes; nothing
   less would kindle the self-reproach and the shame which must abase
   their pride, and teach them their own utter helplessness, and the
   tenderness with which they ought to handle the sins of other men. There
   is an ingratitude in self-confidence; a forgetfulness of God, by whom
   alone we stand. It is like the self-complacency of He rod, when he made
   his oration unto the people; [66] or the self-exaltation of
   Nebuchadnezzar, when he "walked in the palace of the kingdom of
   Babylon, . . . and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built
   for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the
   honour of my majesty?" [67] For these things God brings us down,
   leaving us to ourselves. He withdraws His hand; and we fall heavily,
   and become a by word and a reproach. "They that sit in the gate speak
   against" us, "and the drunkards make songs upon" us. [68]

   One great fall makes the scales to drop from men's eyes, and they see
   themselves surrounded by the danger of many worse; that this is perhaps
   the least, yet it is very stunning. They see how far they have ventured
   into dangerous ways; how they have chosen their own path; withdrawn
   from God's keeping; how relaxed is their whole character; how open to
   the inroads of sin; how many of their best points consist only in not
   being tempted. And God, in His love, suffers them to learn this at any
   cost, for fear of worse; and all that they have been in time past seems
   cancelled. All their profession, acts of religion, almsdeeds, fasts,
   prayers, humiliations, seem to be gone, as things they have now no
   right in. They have brought a shame on all, and shewn its hollowness;
   and after many years of professed religion, while others are looking on
   them as saints, they are with in full of shame and desolation; words of
   respect are dreadful rebukes, especially if they were once deserved.
   They are now forced down to begin all over again; to come to God as the
   poor prodigal; to take the lowest place of all, that of "the servant
   who knew his Lord's will, and did it not." [69] Fearful discipline,
   full of a searching anguish of heart. Yet necessary, and, if necessary,
   blessed; for all things are better than to be a castaway. Any suffering
   in this world, rather than to perish in the world to come. Any shame
   now, rather than shame before Christ at His coming with the holy
   angels.

   I have endeavoured to suggest briefly what is the nature of those
   temptations by which religious people are peculiarly beset; and have
   very slightly noticed what seems to be the cause of their liability to
   be overcome by them. We will hereafter consider the mysterious design
   of God in permitting them to be abased with such falls. To sum up what
   has been said in the fewest words, I will add, that want of
   circumspection and of a watchful salutary fear of falling, is in itself
   a tempting of God. How much more, then, the venturous way in which some
   men enter upon paths which are either not pointed out to them by God's
   providence, or even forbidden! But at present we have chiefly to
   consider the dangers which beset religious minds. A few words will be
   enough to shew, what need there is even for the most advanced and
   practised in religion to watch without ceasing against the manifold
   dangers of our fallen state. Our whole life is a spiritual combat.
   While we live we must contend. This is not our rest.

   (1.) For it must be remembered, that the great est saint may be tempted
   to the worst of sins. I do not say the temptation will prevail; God for
   bid; but that temptations may be addressed to him; and if the most
   saintly minds may be tempted, how much more are we open to the
   incursions of temptation! It is true of our blessed Lord alone, that
   the devil, after he was once fully foiled in his endeavour to seduce
   Him from God, began thence forward for ever to oppose and to afflict
   Him. There was no hope of prevailing against Him, because the prince of
   this world had nothing in Him. There was no inward sin on which to work
   by allurements or stimulants. Not so with us: to the end of life we
   carry a fallen nature, with its taints and proneness to evil. This is
   mortified and kept under in those that live a holy life, but still in
   some sort remains within. To the end the prince of this world has
   something in us; and to this he addresses his flatteries and
   persuasions. How strange it seems to us to read of Abraham's falsehood,
   David's awful and complex sin, the denials of Peter, the contention of
   Paul and Barnabas! If such saints were tempted and overcome, how shall
   we escape temptations and down falls? It is true that, as men grow in
   grace, temptation loses much of its power over them, St. John says,
   "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for His seed remaineth
   in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God." [70] And again:
   "We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is
   begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not."
   [71] That is to say, that in every saint there is the power of the Holy
   Ghost, which is more than sufficient to ward off temptations. The gift
   of regeneration, unfolded into a new spirit, is so at variance with the
   solicitations of evil, that it would do a great violence to itself if
   it should deliberately sin; the circumspection of the regenerate is
   such that the snares and assaults of Satan are powerless and vain. All
   this describes the spiritual strength and matured stedfastness of those
   that are holy. It is not an immunity from temptation, but a moral power
   residing in the will, by which the tempter is perfectly repelled. It
   does not say, that holy men are not tempted. It does not mean, that the
   holiest cannot fall. To the end, all stedfastness is subject to the
   laws of probation. But in us, who, alas, are neither strong nor holy,
   save in the measure common to ordinary Christians, there must ever be
   the danger of being, not only tempted, but overcome. Our past religion
   will not save us. Our stedfastness is not in what we have been, but in
   what we are: and we are, most of us, still weak and frail. What may
   befall a saint may easily prevail against us. So long as we are in the
   flesh, the eye and the ear are open, and the imagination is rest less
   and full of visions. These may be mortified indeed, and then sin will
   address itself to them in vain. But address itself it will; and the
   habits of watchfulness and self-control may be relaxed, and the
   character let down to a pitch where sin has a greater sway and a surer
   dominion.

   Spiritual declension is a very awful reality, and the most devout may
   fall into it. Of this we have sufficient proofs and examples in holy
   Scripture; and any one who has examined his heart must also know how
   his state has varied at various times. In times of sorrow, or any great
   fear, we know what a peculiar tenderness of conscience; what a dread of
   trifling even with a thought of sin; what gentleness and kindly
   dispositions we have felt towards all, even unworthy persons, and to
   their very faults; what an awful, and yet blessed, perception we have
   had of God's nearness to us, and how open our hearts have been towards
   Him; what circumspection in all the least actions of our life. After
   the lapse of a few years, or sometimes of a few months, how has all
   this been changed; what a slumber and inertness of the inner life; what
   dulness of conscience; what fearlessness of sin; how little compunction
   at having inwardly assented to temptation! We seem not to be the same
   persons: as if we had lost our identity--had become altogether changed,
   and had passed into a worse nature. There is something fearful and
   depressing, in the highest degree, to find ourselves so fallen. The
   recollection of past times, when our heart was clear and peaceful, is
   both an humiliation and a rebuke. And it is with a bitter sadness that
   we say, "Oh, that I were as in months past, as in the days when God
   preserved me; when His candle shined upon my head, and when by His
   light I walked through darkness; as I was in the days of my youth, when
   the secret of God was upon my tabernacle!" [72]

   (2.) Another truth to be remembered is, that the worst sins come on
   insensibly. They seldom, if ever, present themselves to a holy mind in
   their full outline at once. They very seldom become really visible in
   their first approaches. They lie masked behind indifferent things,
   mingled in the duties and offices of our station, covered even with a
   religious aspect; then they shew themselves only in part, which, taken
   alone, may be harmless, but prepares the way for that in which the true
   evil lies. When the serpent tempted Eve, he did not at once put before
   her the act of disobedience, but first engaged her thoughts with the
   question, "Yea, hath God said?" There needs much preparing to break the
   startling effect of a temptation. If we could see at once the full
   reach and depth of the evil, we should be saved by our very fears.
   Dread would make us recoil. We should not so much as trust ourselves in
   the indifferent things which are the avenues to it. We would rather die
   than commit it. Besides, most of the dangers of religious people lie in
   the region of things that are lawful. They do not overstep the
   boundaries which separate things permitted from things for bidden; into
   the latter they seldom, if ever, willingly allow themselves to go. The
   tempter must overtake them within the range of their own permitted
   sphere, and therefore must use lawful things as the matter of his
   temptations. Lawful things out of season or out of measure, become to
   them the occasions of falling. Breaches of self-control, of
   self-chastisement, of vigilant watchfulness, of circumspect care over
   acts, words, and even thoughts; these are the beginning, and through
   these he prevails to entangle us in excesses, irregularities,
   immoderation. At the outset we see nothing, and there really is
   nothing, in which we may not allow ourselves. But in the season,
   measure, and use, there lies the whole character of the act, and the
   whole probation of our will.

   (3.) And once more; it is the nature of such temptations to prevail
   before we become aware of them. It is only by retrospect that we really
   find ourselves to be fallen; as we cannot mark changes of our natural
   growth and countenance but by recollection. I do not mean, that all
   along there are no intimations that things are going wrong. Such,
   indeed, there are; but they are very subtil and very gradual, so as to
   be almost imperceptible in their advance. They seem to be checked when
   really they are advancing, and to be kept at bay when they have already
   gained the mastery. And then, when we find ourselves taken in the
   snare, we see also the whole course of the temptation; and how many
   times we might have withdrawn ourselves; and how many admonitions we
   received; and how uncalled for was our original self-exposure to the
   danger: we then see how self-sought it was, how gratuitous, how wanton.
   And we bitterly reproach ourselves when it is too late, and see a
   thousand things which ought to have been our protection; a thousand
   warnings, any one of which would now seem to be enough to startle us
   into a posture of defence. These are among our saddest thoughts. We can
   but reproach our folly. We feel to have shut ourselves out from God; to
   have forfeited all claim to be heard. When we pray, it seems as if He
   had surrounded Himself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass
   through. The sin we have been betrayed into stands before us in a
   fearful stature, and seems to overshadow us, hiding the face of God and
   the cross of Christ from our sight. That which men would have chosen
   martyrdom rather than commit, they sometimes find themselves to have
   committed at the suggestion of an ordinary temptation.

   Now, I have intentionally avoided giving examples of any particular
   sins, because there is a danger of seeming to limit to certain classes
   of temptations that which is common to all. Examples make general
   statements more vivid and definite; but they also narrow and
   circumscribe the reach and extent of them. What has been said will
   apply to any kind of sin, whether of the flesh or of the spirit, which
   can prevail against any one who in the main lives a life of obedience.
   What sins can so prevail, and the particular forms of them, it is not
   my intention now to consider; but one caution may be given. Let us all,
   in whatsoever state we are, howsoever long we may have lived a
   religious life, nevertheless watch against every sin of every kind,
   great and small, of the flesh and of the spirit. There is none we may
   give over watching against; for we are in most danger of those against
   which, feeling ourselves secure, we watch the least.

   Let us now consider, in a few words, what is the mysterious design of
   God in permitting even religious people to fall.

   1. First, it is evidently to break their presumption, to destroy
   self-trusting, and to awaken a watchful and humble dependence on His
   grace and keeping. There is a tendency in us all, even in the midst of
   the acts of a holy life, to tower too high, and to become unsteady in
   our exaltation. This must be abased, "lest, being lifted up with
   pride," we "fall into the condemnation of the devil." [73] This one
   temper will destroy the whole spiritual life. It makes all religion a
   mere formality. Prayers, confessions, fastings, humiliations what are
   all these to a mind that is possessed with a self-trusting spirit? Even
   ascetic rules only brace this self-confidence more intensely, and raise
   it to a higher pitch. It is so easy to be severe to ourselves, when we
   are not tempted to be otherwise. Half of our severity has in it no real
   principle of self-discipline, as we soon find when we are tempted to
   relax. This is a secret we must needs learn, or we shall have but
   imperfect knowledge of ourselves; and through imperfect self-knowledge,
   imperfect repentance, imperfect humiliations. It is by such falls that
   God reveals to us what is in ourselves, and excites in us a horror of
   our own obstinate corruptions. They are the scourges of our sloth, the
   chastisements of our lukewarmness, and judgments upon our presumption
   in "tempting the Lord our God."

   2. Another purpose of God in thus humbling even those who in many
   things are His servants is, to teach them to be forbearing and
   compassion ate towards those that are fallen. A self-trusting spirit is
   almost always censorious, harsh, exacting. With an artificial standard
   of its own, it is in considerate and unsympathising to others. Such
   people are quick to see blots in others, and to censure them; ready to
   observe their falls, and to find out the aggravating features of their
   case. They have an honest zeal against sin; but they have little
   tenderness for sinners. Their admonitions have a sharp edge, and their
   reproofs sound like reproaches. Even truth in their mouth is
   uncharitable, and their warnings are without mercy. People often are
   not aware of all this. They speak as they feel. What they say seems
   deserved; and perhaps it is so; but, it may be, they are not the
   persons who ought to say it. It may be that the very same sins, or even
   worse, lie coiled within them. All the time they are virtually what
   those they reprove are in act. In others they are, by anticipation,
   condemning themselves. They go on recording hard censures, laying up
   unsparing verdicts, against the day when a sudden fall shall point them
   all against themselves. Now this sort of character is by no means
   uncommon; nor is it necessarily hypocritical, but simply
   self-deceiving. They have presumed upon God, and their own strength;
   and have learned to speak in a language above themselves. And God
   corrects this by leaving them to themselves, and suffering them to be
   tempted in a season of weakness, when their natural strength, on which
   they rest, is all they have. They fall; and learn what St. Paul meant
   when he said, "Brethren, if any man be overtaken in a fault, ye which
   are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
   considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted." [74] The consciousness
   of having fallen in the like way, makes a man afraid to act the
   reprover. He feels his words recoil upon himself; and he speaks as he
   himself can bear it, making his own heart the measure of his words, and
   his own case the interpreter and pleader for the falls of others. All
   his past censures come back upon him with a fearful severity; and he
   feels as if he could never rebuke any one again. It seems as if the
   worst he ever had to reprove were better than himself. It seems to him
   as if he could never any more use rebukes, but only beseech them, with
   tender compassion, and even with tears, to join him in humbling
   themselves before One who alone is without sin. It is true, indeed,
   that the perfect holiness of saints has in it a tender compassion and a
   loving pity, like to the Spirit of Christ Himself. They have received
   of Him the gift of tenderness to sinners, without the fearful
   discipline of personal falls; and theirs is the highest and most
   healing sympathy. But for us, weak Christians, the school of pity is
   the melancholy experience of our own humiliations. And well is it to
   learn compassion any how; for the harsh and impatient are not near to
   the kingdom of heaven. Let us not venture to reprove any without a
   vivid recollection of our own past falls; nor in any way speak of the
   sins of others without a deep sense of our own .

   3. And, lastly, it is to teach us our need of fixed and particular
   rules for the government of our lives; and that not in great matters
   only, but in the least; because it is in little things that the first
   approaches of sin are made to religious minds. We must not trust in
   general rules, in good intentions, in the expectation of being able to
   meet particular temptations by defences adopted on the spot. We need
   much forethought, foresight, and determination. Our system of
   discretionary rules must spread over all our life; over our duties, our
   devotions, our intercourse with others, whether of the Church or of the
   world; it must prescribe to us counsels of wisdom for our whole
   bearing, our words, our personal habits. Wherefore, St. Paul says,
   "Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of
   God." [75] No part of our daily life is too slight to admit of a holy
   intention, as none is too small to become the seat of great
   temptations. Another reason for this carefulness in prescribing even
   the detail of our daily life is, that unless our rules are fixed, they
   cannot become habitual and confirmed. The very strength and life of all
   self-discipline is order, certainty, and decision. Our true safeguard
   against temptation is, to be the same at all times, in all companies,
   in all places; not to vary, and adapt ourselves to the humour of
   others, thereby adopting their temptations with their habits; but to be
   always and every where ourselves, and to oppose to the temptations of
   the world the consistency of a matured and practised habit of
   self-control. Indeed, in this most men err grievously. They are strict
   at home, and lax abroad; that is, they are rigid when they are not
   tempted, and loose when they are in the midst of temptations; watchful
   where the danger is little, and off their guard where it is great:
   whereas they ought, on the contrary, to be all the more severe,
   rigorous, watchful, and guarded, be cause they are out of their
   sheltered retirement, and beset by the illusions and solicitations of
   the world. Yet we seldom see men who are devout and careful at home
   even equally so in society. And to what bitter reproaches, to what
   hours of miserable retrospect, to what fearful havoc in the spiritual
   life, does this relaxation lead! How do men that go forth with many
   saintly tokens upon them, come home in remorse, to put ashes upon their
   heads!

   Alas, the world's kisses are death to the hidden life. The world is
   perilous in its array; full of seducing spirits, crafty, fair- seeming,
   versatile, and deadly. We may well fear it. Well is it if we fear it
   greatly; for few there be that fear it at all. Happy are they who walk
   unspotted of the world, in ways of lowliness and self-mistrust; and
   happy they whose pride is abased, and whose presuming hearts are
   brought down by a salutary humiliation. Piercing as the discipline may
   be, better is it to have a spiritual sorrow, "sharper than any
   two-edged sword," than to walk proud and blindfold, "deceiving and
   being deceived," tempting the Lord our God.

SERMON VIII.

  WORLDLY AMBITION.

    ST. MATT. iv. 8-10.

   "Again, the devil taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain, and
   sheweth Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and
   saith unto Him, All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall
   down and worship me. Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan:
   for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only
   shalt thou serve."

   THIS temptation seems to be an offer of worldly power on an unlawful
   condition. The tempter addressed himself to that inclination of our
   nature which, when perverted in us, is ambition and vainglory. We are
   wont to call ambition an infirmity which lingers last and longest of
   all, even in minds that are noble and pure. It has in it, as we think,
   nothing low, mean, or little. It is closely allied with the
   consciousness of great powers, right intentions, high purposes of
   unselfish devotion for the welfare of others; it is upon a large scale,
   and takes a wide sweep and range in its aims and endeavours; it thereby
   lifts itself out of the common level of mankind, and rises above all
   lesser inducements, and the motives which sway other men; its whole
   tone and bearing has a breadth, dignity, and grandeur nearly allied to
   moral greatness. Perhaps it was in the belief that our blessed Lord was
   at least susceptible of some such pure and exalted allurement, that
   Satan presented to Him "the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of
   them."

   He "taketh Him up into an exceeding high mountain." We shall do best to
   understand this as we read it. The truest interpretations are those
   that are nearest to the letter. We do not know by what laws of motion
   or of place this mysterious passage was controlled. All the conditions
   of the spiritual world are inscrutable to us. As in the book of the
   prophet Ezekiel we read of his rapture to Tel-abib: "The spirit took me
   up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed
   be the glory of the Lord from His place. I heard also the noise of the
   wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise
   of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. So the
   spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the
   heat of my spirit; but the hand of the Lord was strong upon me. Then I
   came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of
   Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among
   them seven days" [76] --and again, of his rapture to Jerusalem: "And it
   came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of
   the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before
   me, that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me. Then I beheld,
   and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his
   loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the
   appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber. And he put forth the
   form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit
   lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the
   visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh
   toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which
   provoketh to jealousy. And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was
   there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. Then said he
   unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north."
   [77] Moreover, we read of the rapture of St. Philip to Azotus, and of
   St. Paul into the third heaven; [78] of the mysterious visitations of
   our Lord after His resurrection, and of His ascension to the right hand
   of God. It is, therefore, more natural to believe, that as our Lord was
   "led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted," so Satan was
   permitted to take Him to the pinnacle of the temple and to the
   mountain-height, to consummate the mystery of His temptation. And we
   shall do best simply to believe, that from some vast summit, looking
   down upon a boundless reach of earth, the tempter did shew the
   kingdoms, and pomp, and riches, and splendour, and glory of the world.
   It was a vision of worldly power and greatness, full of allurements and
   promises; of unbounded means of doing good to man kind; of wielding
   such dominion as perhaps man never wielded before. Whether Satan had
   any power to fulfil this promise; whether any indirect means, through
   the agency of evil, of bestowing the kingdoms of this world; whether
   any control was permitted to him over the collective actings, as over
   the individual acts, of men, so as to give him a sway in the disposal
   of earthly crowns--we know not. It may be that the promise was mere
   guile--fair and false: but this matters little. The temptation was
   simply this, that our blessed Lord should obtain the powers and gifts
   of the world by transferring His obedience from God to Satan. And this
   brings the nature of the temptation within the sphere of our ordinary
   trials. It is, in fact, the peculiar temptation of those who love and
   seek after greatness, power, dominion, that is, of the ambitious; and
   as such we will go on to consider it. Now of those that seek after
   worldly power, some seek it in unlawful, some in lawful ways; some with
   motives wholly selfish; some with a persuasion that they desire it for
   the good of others and for the glory of God. And perhaps these latter,
   whatever they might admit in regard to the former kind of men, would
   very much resent being told that they are in danger of falling down and
   worshipping the tempter. Perhaps this would be gene rally thought to be
   a harsh judgment, and untrue. And yet there will be found in it more
   truth than they are aware of; it is therefore well worthy of our
   consideration: for there is "an exceeding high mountain" in the heart
   of every man, from which he is ever looking out upon manifold
   temptations.

   1. First of all, it is obvious that to seek for worldly power and
   greatness by the use of unlawful means is a direct revolt from God. It
   is a deliberate disobedience to His will; a withdrawal of allegiance,
   trust, fear, hope, reverence, and worship from Him. It may not, indeed,
   be followed by any perceptible addresses to the prince of this world,
   or by acknowledged commerce with him. Men may not, by any deliberate
   compact, "make a covenant with death," nor "be at agreement with hell;"
   nor, like Saul, when he had forsaken the Lord, go disguised, and
   inquire by night of those that have a familiar spirit: nevertheless
   they do, in the most real and effectual way, fall down and worship the
   powers of darkness. For what do men really acknowledge, in the fact of
   using unlawful means, such as force, wrong, falsehood, deception,
   equivocation, to accomplish their aims, but that these things have
   power and efficacy to aid and foster their designs? and what are these
   but powers of darkness, in which they trust, and venture their hopes of
   success? Take the case of Jeroboam. It was God's will to give him the
   kingdom of Israel; but in His own time and way. Jeroboam took it by
   rebellion, and retained it by idolatry. He used the policy of the devil
   to accomplish a promise of God. He fell down and worshipped him, that
   he might have the kingdom at once. And he bequeathed this wicked
   policy, and the plausible necessity of maintaining it, to the kings of
   Israel for ever; so that he stands recorded as "Jeroboam, the son of
   Nebat, who made Israel to sin." No doubt, after him, great reasons of
   state were found to keep open the schism from the temple, and to
   maintain the calves at Dan and Bethel; wise men, and astute
   counsellors, were not wanting to lament the necessity, and to
   perpetuate the sin, till a whole people fell down and worshipped the
   powers of evil, from generation to generation. Wars of acquisition,
   crafty diplomacy, the most dazzling splendour of earthly rule, many of
   the mightiest exploits in the history of nations,--what will all these
   appear in the day of judgment, but a worship of the world? And what
   will the princes of this world, their "governors, and captains, and
   judges, and treasurers, and counsellors, and all the rulers of the
   provinces," [79] be seen to be in that day--except the few that have
   been saints in secret--but worshippers of power, and darkness, and
   vainglory?

   But this is as true of private men as of public and notorious
   offenders. How few men, with the baits of power, elevation, applause,
   before them, can resist the allurement of indirect means, such as
   compromises, abandonment of pledges or obligations, and the like! It is
   a melancholy and most instructive fact, that there is hardly one of the
   world's great men in whose private history there is not to be found
   some stifling of conscience, some departure from rectitude, stern
   fidelity, and deter mined abiding by truth and right, in the teeth of
   danger, or at the cost of failure in their ruling passion. In the
   earnestness with which they seek their aim, they grow precipitate,
   unscrupulous, reckless, obdurate; and that in proportion as the end
   nears, and the strife thickens, and success or failure are in the
   crisis. One last step, the last act which secures the desires of a
   life, is often one that henceforward makes life not worth the living.
   They have succeeded; the point is won. But at what a cost! At the price
   of their heart's faith in the power of truth and right. They have in
   some way struck a bargain, or chaffered with a lie, and put their trust
   for success in a falsehood, which, if it be any thing, is an unclean
   spirit. They have withdrawn their faith from the supremacy of
   righteousness, they have forsaken the service of truth and goodness,
   because these appeared to be despised, disarmed, and exiled, because
   the world seemed too strong for them, and because the dictates of faith
   and truth pointed to paths that seemed to lead away from the desired
   end. And yet, if wrong and falsehood can at all bring success, by whose
   strength do they prevail? Who is he that works by them in the world,
   but the same that said, "All these things will I give Thee, if Thou
   wilt fall down and worship me?" Unlawful means are the laws and policy
   of the kingdom of darkness; they are its statute and its common law,
   its usages and prerogatives; and any man who invokes them makes himself
   a subject of that kingdom, and a liege and worshipper of its prince.

   2. And, once more. It may be objected, all this is plain in the case of
   those that use unlawful means; but surely it cannot be said of those
   who use no means but such as are lawful in the pursuit of advancement;
   or, in other words, it is possible to be ambitious, and yet never to
   seek the aims of ambition by means that are forbidden. It may be said,
   also, that a man ought to desire to rise in his profession, to extend
   his usefulness, to gain influence, to become an authority, and the
   like.

   Now, to this there are many answers.

   First of all, it will generally be found, that men who set themselves
   to rise in their profession, as it is called, do so by unintermitting
   exertion of their own natural powers. The world calls it honourable
   exertion, a laudable enthusiasm, with out which a man will never
   succeed. It is much to be feared that this is often a mere stretch of
   the natural faculties, an unsanctified exertion of intellect or
   perseverance, and an entire reliance on their own powers, with a
   virtual but real withdrawal of faith from the providence of God. And
   what are our natural powers, apart from the illumination and guidance
   of God, but powers of this life, of this fallen, deceived, and
   deceiving world? What is self-reliance, but a disguise of the tempter,
   masking himself from our sight in the workings of our own minds? The
   whole life of an ambitious man, trusting to his own powers, even though
   he never transgress the strict laws of truth and uprightness, what is
   it but weariness, rivalry, anxiety, self-guidance? Now this is as full
   a withdrawal of submission and docile reliance from God, as can be
   imagined. If he does not fall down and worship the tempter, he does not
   worship God by seeking all things as His gift. And what is this
   withdrawal of worship from God but a direct worship of self, or a
   constructive worship of this world, of its powers, chances, and events?

   Another thing that may be said is, that this withdrawal of the heart
   from God is all the more explicit when the subject-matter of a man's
   life is of a kind in which the providence of God is specially
   manifested; such, for instance, as all offices in His Church, and all
   things which lead or relate to them. It is not only by simoniacal
   contracts that men may obtain holy functions by bar ter with the enemy
   of the Church. The use and laying out of natural gifts and powers, such
   as intellect, learning, dexterity, eloquence, and, much worse, of the
   gifts of His Spirit, so as to attract the notice of those in whose
   hands is the disposal of dignities and preferments; the willing
   acceptance of prominent places; the doing of acts in a direct line of
   suggestion or invitation of ulterior ends; the outrunning of the
   providence of God; the overpassing of limits which He has drawn along
   our path, into spheres where we no longer have His sanction, which in
   themselves are lawful, but are not for us: in these and many other ways
   men do distinctly transfer the intention of their heart and its
   affections from God, as the guide and disposer of their life, to an
   unknown power, which is partly self, partly the world, and covertly he
   who, through the world and ourselves, leads us captive at his will.

   3. And again. Men may most fully entangle themselves in this sin of
   transferring their worship from God to the prince of this world,
   without ever using any means, lawful or unlawful, to attain their
   desires. There is such a thing as a sup pressed covetousness or
   ambition, an importunate and unscrupulous craving after things so far
   be yond a man's reach, that he never attempts to attain them. What is
   more common than for men to indulge in visions of what they desire to
   be and to possess; to harbour, and to fill up with most elaborate
   details, imaginations of great estates, offices, trusts, and stations,
   and what they would do, and say, and look like, if they were in them?
   They fancy to themselves all manner of scenes, actions, successes; and
   people a whole world with dependants, followers, admirers; and tell
   themselves most pleasant tales of wonderful undertakings and
   achievements, kingdoms exalted, factions abolished, nations governed,
   Churches purified, schisms healed, heresies overthrown, mankind
   illuminated; in all of which they are the chief leaders, counsellors,
   and actors. Out of all these splendid and gaudy visions, self emerges
   at last as the beginning and the end of all. They live in a dream of
   self-love; they have waking visions all day long of their own
   importance; and they soothe themselves with the persuasion, that the
   greatest men in the world are often least known and acknowledged.

   In all this the spiritual sin is complete. It is a mixture of
   self-love, self-elevation, forgetfulness of God, who has revealed His
   will in appointing our actual lot, and of craving for what He has not
   ordained for us, with a secret willingness to attain our desired vision
   if we could. The means, indeed, may never come within our reach; but we
   are as willing to possess the kingdoms of the world and the glory of
   them, as if they were tendered to our hand. It is to be feared, that if
   the means were presented, we should be tempted to be unscrupulous in
   using them. Perhaps we should not venture on direct and visible
   transgressions of the divine laws; though it is hard to say to what we
   may not be led by a habit of self-intoxication and secret vainglory. It
   is certain that we are thereby disposed, by preparation of heart, for
   any thing rather than fail in our cherished desires. It is very awful
   to think of the unknown sins which are virtually contained in strong
   desires after the things of this world. When they master a man, they
   make him impatient of all obstructions, reckless of moral prohibitions,
   of the admonitions of Providence, and the warnings which God conveys
   when He visibly withholds from us the means of attaining what we
   desire. To go on craving after an end which He keeps back, is morally
   equivalent to seeking it by unlawful means. In either case it is a
   contravention of the Divine will. No one can as yet conceive, how
   deeply the hearts of some men who never emerge from private life are
   tainted by this sin; those, too, who are least suspected, whose outward
   life gives no opportunities of expressing in any definite form the
   particular kind or direction of their ambitious hankering. Perhaps they
   never exhibit more than discontent, bitterness, and a censorious
   temper. The secret is untold, and dies with them; it is seen only by
   the holy angels, and shall never be known until the secrets of all
   hearts shall be revealed.

   This is true not of those alone who are baffled in their ambition or
   disappointed in their expectations, but also of the most successful.
   Power reveals what is in man. The sins of self-confidence and
   self-contemplation reach their height in the man who has gained his end
   without seeking and receiving it as a gift from God. Success is a
   confirmation, in retrospect, of all his self-choosing, self-guidance,
   self-advancement. He is, as men vauntingly say, the maker of his own
   fortunes; and strange enough it is, that even Christians use such a
   phrase in commendation. Men who have risen in the world as statesmen,
   jurists, warriors, orators, merchants, philosophers, and the like, are
   often practical atheists. They have so long taken cognisance of no
   powers and agencies but such as they can measure, calculate, and
   control, that they cease to be conscious of any other. They act as if
   higher powers did not exist--that is, as if they did not believe them.
   They could not ignore them more completely if they did not believe
   them; and what in effect is this but to be "without God in the world?"
   And this habit of acting without dependence on God forms first an
   unconsciousness, and then an insensibility, of His presence and power.
   What do we mean when we say that a man is intoxicated with the world,
   or eaten up by self-sufficiency, but that the world is his idol, or
   that his trust is in himself? And what is this but self-worship--the
   finest of Satan's wiles? Something a man must supremely love, trust,
   reverence, and obey. If it be not God, it can only be one other. Under
   whatsoever guise or array--whether it be the powers of the world, or
   the laws of nature, or the agencies of men, or the gifts of intellect,
   or moral force, or those faculties which seem most our own, that is,
   our very self,--it is no other than he who, on the top of the mountain,
   said, "All these things will I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and
   worship me." Self is but the subtilest array and the near est approach
   of his presence. When we worship ourselves we worship him.

   And this leads to one or two plain reflections.

   One is, that the highest apparent success in this world is often the
   most real and utter failure. By accepting of its offers, many men have
   in reality lost all. There is something very fearful in the uniform
   success which seems sometimes to attend on wicked men. All winds and
   tides, and outward influences, and conjunctures of unlooked for events,
   seem to befriend and to wait upon their will. They are carried up to
   the head of their callings, and to the lead of their professions; to
   the summit of kingdoms, and to the pinnacle of Churches; and wealth
   pours it self at their feet, and men seem fascinated by their tongues,
   and give way to their plans and schemes, and offer themselves for tools
   to carry them into effect. All this seems the favour of Providence, and
   the countersign of the Most High, owning and declaring their acts as
   the will of Heaven. God's servants are often perplexed at these things,
   and are in doubt whether, after all, they have not "cleansed their
   heart in vain, and washed their hands in innocency." It seems, for a
   time, either that right and wrong are artificial and conventional
   usages, or that the laws of God's providence are out of course. "Until
   I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I the end of these
   men; namely, how Thou dost set them in slippery places, and castest
   them down, and destroyest them." [80] It is the Divine indignation
   which bids them prosper. The world loves its own, and heaps its gifts
   and honours on those that are likeminded with itself. They that have
   most cunning to advance its interests, touch its sympathies, flat ter
   its weaknesses, soothe its disappointments, and sustain its
   self-esteem, are its surest favourites. And, under the supreme control
   of the Divine Providence, which orders the universal scheme of the
   world and disposes all its issues, there is a vast body of inferior
   powers left in the hands of men, whereby to reward and enrich the
   servants of the world. So that there are always at work two
   administrations, a lower and a higher, a human and a divine: the human
   busying itself in details that are visible, proximate, and imperfect;
   the divine ordering those laws that are final, perfect, and supreme.
   Men make beginnings, but God ordains the endings; so that the same man,
   at one and the same time, may both succeed and fail. He may win all in
   the lower world of human action, and lose all in the higher order of
   divine rewards. He may be both most exalted and most abased, most
   prosperous and most baffled, most mighty and most powerless, most
   cherished by men and most cast off by God. Set him on the throne of the
   world, with all creatures at his foot, and his name blotted from the
   book of life. "What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world,
   and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his
   soul?"

   Therefore, when success wafts men onward, they have reason to fear and
   to look with a twofold scrutiny into their aims, employments, and
   alliances. There is something suspicious in the favour of many men, in
   general popularity, worldly reputation, and the concurrent applause of
   those who are morally divided. It savours of the woe "when all men
   shall speak well of" us, and of the kiss that was given in Gethsemane.
   How many men who have begun well, in great fervour and fidelity to God,
   have had their active powers warped, and the warmer affections of their
   hearts stolen away, by the greetings, gifts, and flatteries of life!
   High place, great friendships, open avenues to elevation, daily
   approaching success, have been the ruin and utter loss of thousands.
   From a simple and saint-like temper, they have become subtil,
   designing, and secular. Their worldly powers and their personal
   endowments have been every day developed and multiplied so as to win a
   double measure of admiration and a perpetually increasing name; while
   in the eye of God they have withered and fallen away from the very
   root. Prosperous men are seldom devout; religious men generally suffer
   by success; high characters sink as their worldly reputation rises; and
   moral principle deteriorates as men obtain advancement in the world.
   They gain their point, but in gaining it lose all that makes it to be
   desired. They win places of power, but by means which make them
   powerless when the place is won. Under their seeming success there is
   the deepest failure. They forfeit the kingdom of God for the baits of
   this false and fleeting life; or, for a few years of honour in a fallen
   world, they lose a high place in the orders of heaven, and are even
   "saved so as by fire."

   Another remark we may make is the reverse of the last; I mean, that
   seeming failure is often the truest success. It was He that spurned the
   tempter when he offered Him all the kingdoms of the world who
   afterwards said, "All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth."
   They that forsook houses, brethren, sisters, father, mother, wife,
   children, and lands, for His name's sake, received all these an
   hundredfold, and the heritage of eternal life. Though they had nothing,
   yet they possessed all things. [81]

   So it has ever been with the Church. When she forsook all, then she was
   most richly endowed in heaven; when most overcome, she overcame all.
   Such has been the secret history of saints. Their great powers in the
   world were the reward of their perfect deadness to it. Because they
   refused its offers, therefore they became its rulers. Because they had
   no desire, nor love, nor appetite for it, therefore they were set to
   dispose of it. Because they shunned its titles and exaltations,
   therefore they were honoured and lifted up to the thrones of power.
   They were true followers of Him who, when He perceived that the people
   "would come and take Him by force, to make Him a king, departed again
   into a mountain Himself alone." [82] They ran counter to it, and yet
   won its willing obedience; they were unpopular and unpalateable to the
   men of the world, and yet they were followed and obeyed by them; they
   deprived themselves of its powers and gifts, and did things the most
   inexpedient in the calculations of worldly schemers, and yet all things
   seemed spellbound to work with them and for them. Nothing is more
   certain than that they who have done most for the kingdom of God on
   earth have not been the most popular in their day; and they who have
   been the most popular, even among good men, in the kingdoms of the
   world, have left the fewest and faintest traces of truth upon mankind.
   God seems to work by contraries, and to harden the heart of the world
   against His servants, to "make His power to be known." For some have
   been truly outcast, misrepresented, spoiled, and set aside, so that
   people have thought them fairly defeated and extinct; and yet the
   working of their words and deeds, of their silent example, and
   imperceptible influence on other minds, has spread itself unawares
   through out whole nations and Churches. They have courted no one; were
   solicitous for no favour, or gift, or privilege; they have even crossed
   the wise and powerful, and resisted the hands which hold the powers of
   the world. Many of the greatest benefactors of mankind have died
   without leaving so much as to pay their burial, and yet the hearts of
   men have obeyed them to the third and the fourth generation.

   And what is the secret of all this, but that they worshipped the Lord
   their God, and Him only did they serve? They indulged themselves in no
   remote visions, in no restless imaginations, in no exciting
   self-contemplation. The whole horizon of their hearts was clear.
   Nothing lay beneath it disturbing the truth of their intentions. There
   was no end in life they desired but to do the will of God. They had no
   cravings for things out of their sphere, no forecasting and expectation
   of any thing to come. What God had made them, that they simply desired
   to be--to realise deeply their present lot, to live wholly in it and
   for it alone, to confide in it as the pledge of God's presence. No nice
   calculations of probable gain, or usefulness, or power to be gotten
   otherwise or elsewhere, had any sway over them. They would not hesitate
   a moment to do acts of the highest indiscretion, as the world judges,
   and to throw away all promises and offers of interest and advantage,
   rather than seem to yield even a constructive worship to the powers of
   the world. They were of more price than the world: with all its gifts
   and all its gold, it could not buy them. These are they "of whom the
   world was not worthy." It was cheap, slight, and paltry in their eyes;
   for by faith they had already "seen the King in His beauty, and beheld
   the land which is very far off." [83] They had seen the throne and Him
   that sat upon it, who is "as a jasper and a sardine stone" to look
   upon; and all earthly things waxed pale and dim. They had tasted "the
   powers of the world to come," which are perfect and eternal; and the
   purest and best things of this life drew from them not desires, but
   tears. None so intensely perceived the good and beautiful which yet
   lingers in the earth; yet they shrank from the savour of death which,
   by sin, is shed abroad upon the creation of God. They took refuge in
   the unseen kingdom, which is all pure, deathless, ever lasting; serving
   and waiting for Him who "hath made us kings and priests unto God."

   What is this visible world but the disordered array under which the one
   only true kingdom abides the day of "the restitution of all things?"
   The world, with its pageantry, is but shadow and simulation, imitating
   the order of heavenly things. What else are its fountains of honours,
   its patents of nobility, and the solemnity with which it issues out its
   badges and titles of distinction, and arranges its servants in ranks of
   high and low degree, according to their fidelity to its service and
   their devotion to its will? But there is coming a day when "the face of
   the covering" shall be destroyed, "and the veil that is spread over all
   people," [84] and "the kingdom which cannot be shaken" shall stand
   forth, and then shall many be first that now are last, and last first.
   Then will be a strange and awful cancelling of degrees, and an
   unexpected marshalling of God's elect in a new and wonderful order.
   Then it shall be seen for whom the right hand and the left, which the
   sons of Zebedec blindly though nobly desired, are indeed prepared.

   Let us beware, then, of the baits and allurements which are peculiarly
   rife in these latter days. Let us suspect calculations of expediency,
   dexterous plans, great undertakings at little cost, popular systems of
   religion, tempting offers of worldly favour and support--that is, the
   whole course and movement of the world. God's kingdom is to be spread
   and served in God's own way. There is no other than that hard, strait,
   unpopular way which prophets, martyrs, and saints have trod. Let us
   keep close to this. Let no visions draw us out of it. They can only
   beguile us of our reward; promise us kingdoms, and rob us of our crown;
   offer us purple raiment, and make the shame of our nakedness to appear
   "before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels," [85] at
   His coming.

SERMON IX.

  THE RIGHT USE OF REST AFTER TRIAL.

    ST. MATTHEW iv. 11.

   "Then the devil leaveth Him, and, behold, angels came and ministered
   unto Him."

   AFTER the temptation of our Lord was ended, St. Luke says, the devil
   "departed from Him for a season," [86] implying that in some form or
   other Satan was still hovering about His path. And the forty days of
   fasting being now over, He was an hungered, faint, wearied in flesh and
   spirit, with the long and sore conflict He had endured. In this season
   of peace, angels came and ministered strength and refreshment to Him.
   What heavenly communications they made to His exhausted soul, it is not
   for us to imagine. In the wilderness of Sinai "man did eat angels'
   food." In this desert, the Son of Man, "the true bread which came down
   from heaven," was strengthened with the bread of God.

   Now from this we may learn a lesson applicable to our own case, namely,
   that after temptations resisted, there come seasons of peculiar rest:
   "times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord." [87] The mere
   cessation of active trial is in itself an unspeakable relief. So long
   as the tumult is kept up within, we are worn, anxious, and depressed.
   The vividness of evil thoughts and affections, the mistrust and
   repining of our hearts, the useless and incessant chafing of our
   desires against our conscience, the beating of strong wishes against a
   clear consciousness of impossibility or of a divine prohibition--all
   these make a torment within, to which hardly any other sorrow can be
   compared. At such times all other affections of the soul are
   confounded. We seem pent up into one thought, which besets our whole
   mind. Such a season of temptation is a time of havoc and disorder, even
   in those who come off with the mastery at last. Now the mere passing
   away of this is a refreshment, like the waking up out of a troubled
   dream, and finding it to be without reality. When the tempter is
   departed, the trial is passed, and we are full of peace. We have a
   keener perception of God's love shed abroad in us, a consciousness of
   having overcome in the strength of Christ. It seems as if "angels came
   and ministered unto" us out of the depth of heavenly consolation.

   Now such is God's gracious way of dealing with us. After our trial
   comes rest; after our sorrow comes refreshment. But there are peculiar
   dangers attending this blessed change; and we have hardly less need to
   watch when our temptation is ended, than while it is yet upon us. And
   this we will go on to consider.

   1. First, we are in danger of losing the impressions and state of heart
   which the suffering of temptation forms within us. While the trial is
   upon us, we are wakened up to a trembling and lively sense of our own
   weakness, and of the subtilty and strength of our unseen antagonist.
   The thought of being closely and personally assaulted by an evil angel
   is awful. We feel darkened by the thought of spiritual wickedness
   hanging over us. We do not know in what the trial may issue at last;
   how fearfully we may be entangled, or put to open shame, We summon up
   before our minds all manner of dark contingencies and afflicting
   visions of falls and abasement; and how we shall stand in the sight of
   the world with a brand which nothing can conceal. This sense of
   self-mistrust and fear at the presence and power of Satan, miserable
   and oppressive as it is, nevertheless is very salutary. It produces
   great quickness and tenderness of conscience, sensitiveness, and
   vigilance over the purity of our hearts, a quick perception of our own
   hidden sinfulness, of the great discord between our fair outward
   seeming and our real inward state; and all this makes us, for the time,
   peculiarly forbearing to others, gentle, enduring, afraid of
   impatience, or of a motion of resentful temper. We cannot bear our
   wonted high words, lofty looks, fierce tones, uncharitable thoughts.
   Above all, there is no time in which our prayers are more frequent and
   earnest, our self-examination deeper, our desires more importunate and
   sincere. The posture of our mind is less worldly, slothful, secure. Our
   whole inward life is braced up by a kind of tension of all its gifts
   and powers: if I may say so, it is more saintly than at other times.
   Such, I say, are the effects of a present temptation against which we
   are sincerely contending. The danger is, lest this be not the character
   of the mind itself, but a mere antagonism; lest it be only an attitude,
   an accidental posture related to the presence of our spiritual
   adversary, and therefore existing only so long as he is about us. Of
   course, even in the strongest and most self-possessed Christians, the
   presence of temptation will add intensity, consciousness, and effort,
   to their habitual state. This must be so, and is not blameworthy. But
   it is dangerous when it is chiefly so; when the greater part is the
   accidental, and the habitual the less. For then, as soon as the danger
   seems past, a still more dangerous security comes on. Our feelings grow
   less active; we think we have exaggerated our peril, that we have made
   excessive efforts and needless resolutions; our watchfulness over
   ourselves relaxes; the thoughts of our hearts are less taxed, our
   tempers less guarded, our prayers fainter or fewer; our whole state let
   down some degrees of intensity, and our whole posture of mind inclines
   to relaxation. So hard is it to use God's gifts rightly and thankfully.
   When the tempter is departed, we forget him; when angels minister to
   us, we turn our consolations into dangers, and our rest into a
   declension.

   2. The next danger of this time of peace is that our old state, in
   which the temptation found us at first, returns; and yet it is seldom
   altogether so well with us as before. Temptations are sent or permitted
   for many reasons: to try us, to humble us, to purify us, to waken us up
   out of lukewarmness, to kindle us with greater fervour of devotion, to
   form in us a higher tone of character, and to perpetuate it. When the
   temptation is gone, its effects ought still to survive. The fruits of
   the discipline are designed to be an abiding grace in our souls.
   Whatsoever be the peculiar temptation, it was no doubt designed to
   elicit and establish in us the antagonist grace. If we have been
   tempted to pride, it was to leave us rooted in humility; if to
   worldliness, it was to perfect in us a deadness to the gifts of life;
   if it was excess of any kind, it was to chasten us into definite rules,
   strong resolutions, habitual self-denial; and so on. If, with the
   temptation, these also pass away, we shall but have suffered in vain,
   or rather for the worse. For, first, our old character will rise again
   to the surface; our old pride, self-consciousness, self-esteem,
   uncharitableness, luxury, softness, will come out again, encouraged by
   the return of calm, the absence of fear, and even stimulated by
   repression. They have been rather irritated than subdued; and a strange
   self-complacency spreads itself in our minds after a season of
   self-discipline, on the strength of which we take a larger measure of
   freedom. For instance, we think ourselves secure from censoriousness
   if, while we say sharp things of others, we have a consciousness of the
   sin of being censorious still present in our minds; or we think that
   the rest we enjoy is an indication from God that we may indulge it,
   forgetting that all peace must be of God's giving, not of our taking.
   Or again, after self-denial, such as fasting, we consciously allow
   ourselves a freer diet, as if it were neutralised by past abstinence.
   Such are the strange compositions we make with our consciences; and the
   effect is to destroy the simplicity of our acts and the purity of our
   intentions, to make us refined and casuistical in plain duties, and so
   to prepare us to be deluded by the return of temptation.

   3. And once more: another danger is, that active temptations return as
   it were from the opposite side. Sometimes, indeed, the very same comes
   back upon an unwary mind, almost as soon as it seems to be gone, with a
   force sudden and sevenfold, and fairly carries all before it. We may
   have held out for a week under provocation, until the trial seemed
   over, and then some unlooked-for event has kindled the anger of seven
   days in one, and "the last state is worse than the first." So it is in
   other temptations. But gene rally it seems that the manifold
   versatility of Satan changes the avenues of approach and the form of
   his attack. It is but a feint to call all our watchfulness to one
   point, and then to assault us in another. People who have overcome
   temptation to worldliness often become pharisaical--luxurious people
   miserly; they who have been humbling themselves with fasting become
   complacent at the half-admitted suggestion of their humility; or again,
   pure minds may become proud, severe spirits harsh and unsympathising.
   Such are our infirmities; so are we surrounded by temptation, that we
   often do but make exchanges of the sins of boyhood for the sins of
   youth, the sins of youth for the sins of old age, the sins of the flesh
   for the sins of the spirit, and of spiritual sins one for another; the
   more visible for the less perceived, the lower for the more sublime.
   Such is our wonderful and fearful nature, it revolves in a circle with
   an instability and a speed so great, that we rise and fall by an inward
   motion of the heart: at our highest we are nearest to a change, and our
   changes are often diametrical and extreme. Verily it is an awful
   saying, "There are first which shall be last, and last which shall be
   first." "I saw Satan as lightning fall from heaven." Such as the speed
   of his fall, such of tentimes is ours; and as his was from heaven to
   earth, so is ours from the highest aspiration to the lowest abasement.

   Now it will seem, perhaps, paradoxical to say that times of temptation
   are times of safety. Yet there is a truth in it. And it is true thus
   far:--Temptations that are resisted become a whole some and searching
   discipline. Unresisted temptations, or temptations only faintly
   opposed, of course tend simply to perdition. These are excluded from
   our present subject by the very terms of it. We are speaking of Him who
   bruised Satan under His feet, and of those who, like Him and in Him,
   "resist the devil." I have already said what is the temper and posture
   of mind which temptations produce in us; and also that it is doubtless
   the design of God, in suffering us to be so tried, that the spiritual
   state elicited in the season of temptation should become habitual, and
   abide as a gift of grace in us for ever. It may be, that to beings once
   fallen, the pain and toil of this warfare is the only way to perfect
   strength and purity. For our sanctification is the expulsion of evil
   from the will, under the help of God's Spirit, by its own energies and
   acts. Every temptation overcome is such an act of expulsion, and
   therefore tends to our perfect cleansing.

   Of this we are very certain, that at no time is the protection of
   angels and the help of God more near to us than when "the blast of the
   terrible ones is as a storm against the wall." [88] At no time is the
   providence of God more directly pointed upon us than when snares are
   being spread around our feet: nor does the intercession of our blessed
   Lord, who, through temptation, knows "how to succour them that are
   tempted," ever prevail more mightily by His infinite merits than when
   the "hour and the power of darkness" is upon our souls. Peter was our
   type: and all that are tempted were in him, when our gracious Master
   said, "Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift
   you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not."
   [89]

   Strange, indeed, through our perversity, that dangers should come with
   the cessation of danger; that rest, peace, refreshing, quietness,
   should become perils. Yet so, in truth, they too often are. We are most
   liable to temptation at times when we think ourselves least likely to
   be overcome; for instance, when things have been going on smoothly;
   when we have been long unmolested by assaults; when we have overcome
   some solicitations to things unlawful or inexpedient; when we have done
   acts, or made resolutions, of higher devotion; when we have been
   reading and adopting in intention the example of saints; when we have
   been using high and great words of sanctity and of the cross; when we
   have done acts of charity, mercy, faith, and have the gladness of them
   still upon our hearts; when we have been highly accepted and owned of
   God in our prayers, or at the holy Eucharist, as Christ at His baptism,
   just before He was tempted: all these are times when we have need to
   watch with tenfold care, lest, through our slackness of security, peace
   should be more dangerous to us than temptation.

   Let us, then, consider how we ought to use this peace which follows
   upon a season of trial.

   First, we ought to use it for a particular retrospect of the
   circumstances of our temptation. So long as the trial lasts, we are
   less able to take a true view of our case. We ought closely to
   ascertain what were the avenues by which the temptation came upon us;
   what occasions, or salient points, or positions of vantage, we gave to
   the tempter; what were our thoughts and dispositions of mind before it
   made its approach; what were our intentions; what were its symptoms and
   effects. And in all this we shall generally find the spiritual
   discernment and guidance of another more penetrating than our own. And
   the act of laying it open will bring with it that which will tend to
   check our relapse into a like condition.

   Next, it will be necessary for us to make such resolutions of
   self-discipline, as shall cut off the occasion of which temptation took
   advantage before. Sometimes this may not be wholly possible; but in a
   great number of cases it will be. The perpetuating of any one
   resolution made at such a time will be a continual memorial of warning
   and admonition.

   Again: the acts of prayer and humiliation used by us in a season of
   temptation may either wholly or in part be continued, and joined to our
   daily devotions. Again: the day on which we were tempted may be noted
   in every year, or in every week: and the subject-matter of our trial be
   made a topic of self-examination, confession, self-denial.

   And, once more; if others were involved with ourselves, either directly
   or indirectly, as in cases of unkindness or selfishness; or if others
   have been doubtfully affected by our example, as in cases of a more
   public temptation,--we ought to endeavour, by acts of humility and
   charity towards them, and by praying for them that they may be kept
   from all evil, to undo the ill effect we may have caused.

   And, also, we ought thenceforward to set ourselves to the especial
   mortification of that particular sin which our temptation has revealed
   to us. Religious people often hinder their own advancement by a vague,
   indefinite manner of conducting their personal religion. They aim at
   too much at once; and so do nothing deeply. Let us overcome one
   temptation, mortify one evil desire, and the effect will be felt
   throughout our whole character. The habit of self-denial, patience, and
   endurance, is the same in all; let it be well learned in one
   particular, and not only will that temptation be weaker, but we in
   ourselves shall be stronger to subdue all that remain.

   2. But by thus confining ourselves to the details of the particular
   temptation, we shall not hinder our learning a deeper lesson of the
   universal weakness of our nature, and of its susceptibility on all
   sides of being tempted. It is a very bitter and humbling truth, that
   after many years of a religious life we may be dangerously assailed
   even by sins which we had overcome, as we thought, at the very outset
   of our conversion to God. Yet so it is: after years of prayer, strict
   regularity, unblemished reputation, good works, alms, fastings,
   contemplation, all our religious professions will sometimes grow lofty
   and unsteady, and old sins, long ago forgotten, and never so much as
   thought of, make their re-appearance. So weak and unstable is our
   nature; so subtil and tenacious is sin; so rare is an entire conversion
   of the heart to God; so seldom is the foundation of the character laid
   deeply enough in perfect humility. We shall generally find that the
   point in which we have been tempted is not the only vulnerable point of
   our character; often not that which is chiefly so: that it was by the
   force of circumstances we were exposed to this or that particular
   temptation; and that in truth we might have been tempted in many other
   ways, and with more fearful success, as we have points really weaker,
   which were happily not attacked. It is a humbling truth to most of us
   who may think we have gained for ourselves a right to use the language
   of saints, that the greater part of our virtue is in the absence of
   temptation. Now this is a lesson we ought, as soon as we have respite
   from trial, to set ourselves thoroughly to master. Let us pray God to
   give us light to see the universal weakness of our fallen nature; our
   awful proneness to offend. Perhaps if we had not been tempted, we
   should have fallen; that is, if we had not been made aware of our
   weakness, we should have insensibly declined until we had met some
   heavier fall. Therefore, in His mercy, He suffers us to go so near to
   the point of being overcome, that our fear and shame can hardly be
   greater; and then, when we are penetrated with a sense of danger and of
   horror, He interposes and saves us when of ourselves we should be lost.
   How many seeds of evil lie sleeping in us with the same imperishable
   vitality we see in the outward world, waiting only for stimulants to
   unfold it into life! The sins of our years before we repented, the sins
   of our childhood, are still virtually in our spiritual nature, held in
   check often by a weak and almost a broken thread of discipline, ready
   to reappear with the aggravations of our maturer state of light and
   profession. This is a truth we have need thoroughly and mournfully to
   learn.

   3. And lastly, we ought to set ourselves to deepen the whole habit of
   our devotion: our humiliations, abstinence, fasting, meditation,
   prayers, especially in our approaches to the holy Communion. Without
   doubt, the trial from which we have escaped was permitted as a warning
   to chasten us into a more fervent spirit. By it we ought to gain at
   least one degree of advance in holy living. It found us lukewarm, let
   it leave us fervent; it found us armed only in part, let it leave us
   clad in "the whole armour of God." There is much deep significance in
   St. Paul's charge to the Ephesians. "Be strong," he says, "in the Lord,
   and in the power of His might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye
   may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil." Why does he say
   so emphatically "the whole armour," but because with out it we are
   wholly naked: because our forefather stripped himself and us of all the
   glory which was our defence: [90] we were laid open in body and soul,
   eyes and ears, hand and heart, desire and will; and sin had entrance on
   all sides. We have universal need of this impenetrable mail, and can
   spare no part of it. "Wherefore," he says again, "take unto you the
   whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day,
   and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt
   about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; and
   your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all,
   taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all
   the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and
   the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God." [91] It is a
   complete coat of mail, having in it a perfectness, leaving no part
   unarmed, covering the whole man; a girdle, a breastplate, sandals,
   shield, helmet, sword: what does this mean but the unity and
   perfectness of sanctity, the entire conversion and full devotion of the
   soul to God? This shews us how all His saints have overcome, and sat
   down in His throne. They were armed at all points; they counted no part
   of obedience or devotion small or of little import, knowing that the
   smallest imperfection will mar a whole defence; and that the whole
   armour is no stronger than its weakest part, that one breach will
   unlock a whole position. Therefore, if we enter upon a devout life, we
   must not do it by halves, but with decision. There must be no reserves,
   but a full surrender of ourselves, to be wholly sanctified "in spirit,
   and soul, and body." Such was the life of Abraham and Joseph, Moses and
   Daniel, apostles and saints, and of all whose warfare is ended, who
   have put off the armour of the cross, and put on the white raiment,
   where rest has no more dangers.

   And we see also how it is that so many are overcome. Because they have
   armed themselves only in part. There is something wanting in their
   moral habit; some sin unmortified; some lust still living and
   importunate; or there was some neglect in their rule of devotion; in
   prayer or confession, or reading, or meditation, or self-knowledge;
   some thing left undone which leaves them naked in the day of battle.

   This, then, is the use to which we should apply the seasons of rest
   following on our times of trial; to repair what has been marred in our
   conflict; to deepen and multiply our defences on every side; to renew
   the perfectness of our spiritual armour; by cutting off occasions of
   which sin has taken advantage; by binding ourselves with stricter
   resolves; by deepening our exercises of humiliation, prolonging our
   seasons of prayer, multiplying our works of charity; by watching more
   intently over the workings of our whole spiritual life, and devoting
   ourselves, with more perfect deadness and renunciation of the world and
   of our own will, to God. There is a time at hand when angels shall
   minister to them that overcome, in the paradise of God. There rest and
   refreshing shall be unbroken and eternal. Meanwhile we must endure
   hardship as good soldiers of Jesus Christ.

   Let us, then, when we can, flee temptation with all fear; but if at any
   time you be encompassed by it, then turn, and cast your fear aside.
   "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he
   shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them
   that love Him." [92] Here is a benediction and a crown. "The God of all
   grace, who hath called us unto His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after
   that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen,
   settle you." [93] Here is strength and quietness. "Fear none of those
   things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of
   you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation
   ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of
   life." [94] Here is our Helper. "Because thou hast kept the word of my
   patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which
   shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth."
   Here is our safety. "Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou
   hast, that no man take thy crown." [95]

SERMON X.

  THE SYMPATHY OF CHRIST.

    HEBREWS iv. 15.

   "We have not an high-priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of
   our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
   without sin."

   ONE great and blessed truth contained in the mystery of the Incarnation
   is the sympathy of Christ: that as He is truly Man, so He truly and
   really partakes of our infirmities, and has a fellow-feeling of them
   with us. St. Paul had said a little before, in speaking of the
   Incarnation, "in that He Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is
   able to succour them that are tempted." [96] The word tempted here
   includes, of course, all trials of soul and body, such as sorrow, pain,
   anguish, as well as what we commonly call temptation: but it is to this
   last that we will now confine ourselves. In the text, St. Paul adds,
   "yet without sin." And this raises a question which it concerns us much
   to consider. We can readily understand how our Lord's perfect humanity
   should sympathise with ours, because both are of one nature; but how He
   who is sinless should sympathise with us sinners,--this is the
   difficulty. He had no taste of the bitterness of conscious sin; that
   one greatest of all afflictions was positively unknown to Him. He made
   trial of all things of which our humanity in a sinless state is
   susceptible; but of that which comes upon us as sinners, it were
   blasphemy to suppose Him to have tasted--I mean, the fears, shame,
   remorse, self-abhorrence, which come with sin. It would seem that here
   His sympathy cannot reach: that it must be confined within the limits
   of our purer sorrows; such as affliction and pain. How, it may be
   asked, can He sympathise in repentance, deserved shame, and guilt of
   conscience? This is no easy question to answer: but so much of the
   consolation of true penitents must depend on it, that we shall do well
   to find, if we can, some reply.

   It may be said, then, that this difficulty carries its own answer; for
   His sympathy with penitents is perfect, because He is sinless: its
   perfection is the consequence of His perfect holiness. And for these
   reasons:

   First, because we find, even among men, that sympathy is more or less
   perfect, as the holiness of the person is more or less so. There is no
   real sympathy in men of a sensual, worldly, unspiritual life; unless we
   are to call that inferior fellow-feeling which ranks with our natural
   instincts, and is to be found also in the lower animals, by the name of
   sympathy. There is a natural pity, benevolence, and compassion, which,
   even among heathen, expresses itself in congratulations and
   condolences, and we may in one sense call it sympathy; but it is its
   lowest and most irrational form, little differing from the perceptions
   of cold and heat, sweet and bitter, which are common to all mankind.
   There is little distinct consciousness about it. And even these
   sympathies of nature are crossed and crushed by personal faults.
   Ambition, covetousness, selfishness, will extinguish them; much more
   actual familiarity with sin. Just as a man becomes infected by the
   power of evil, he ceases to sympathise with others. All his feelings
   centre in himself. Sin is essentially a selfish thing. It sacrifices
   every thing to its own lust and will. It is also peculiarly merciless.
   Reckless as it is of the evil of sin, and therefore lenient to the
   worst offenders, it is, nevertheless, peculiarly uncharitable, hard,
   and unfair. Sinners put the worst construction on each others words and
   acts. They have no consideration or forbearance. Their apparent
   sympathy is but a fellowship in the same disobedience. And so also the
   sympathy of the world; how hollow, formal, and constrained it is! How
   little soothing or consoling in our sorrows and trials are worldly
   friends, even the kindest hearted of them! And why, but because it is
   peculiarly the property of true sanctity to be charitable? and in the
   grace of charity is contained gentleness, compassion, tenderness of
   hand in touching the wounds of other men, fair interpretations, large
   allowances, ready forgiveness. These things ripen as personal holiness
   grows more mature. We may almost measure our advance in the life of God
   by the tenderness of our feeling towards sinners. The living
   compassion, active emotion of pity, the tears and tenderness with which
   the holiest men have ever dealt with the sinful, is a proof, that in
   proportion as sin loses its power over them, their sympathy with those
   that are afflicted by its oppressive yoke becomes more perfect. It may
   be said, indeed, that they know by present experience what is the
   distress and shame of sin; that they really have in them the original
   taint; and that it is by virtue of this that they are able so
   intimately to sympathise with the trials of others who are repenting.
   Nevertheless, it is most certain that this sympathy becomes more
   perfect in proportion as their repentance is perfect, and their warfare
   turned into the peace of established sanctity; that is, in proportion
   as they cease to be like those they sympathise with in the very point
   of sinfulness.

   And if we may venture a while to dwell on thoughts beyond our
   probation, in which some have presumed too far, may we not believe that
   this law prevails to perfect the mutual sympathy of those who are in
   the higher state of separation from this evil world? Of the invisible
   Church we can only speak by conjecture and hope, grounded upon such
   internal suggestions as are contained in truths undoubtedly revealed.
   We know that they are without sin. "He that is dead is free from sin."
   [97] We know that they are "made perfect." [98] We cannot doubt that
   they are replenished with charity--perfect in the sympathies of love
   and compassion--that they are knit one with another in a perfect bond
   of fellowship. And moreover, with their personal identity, doubtless,
   they retain a recollection of this world of sin, and of the trials,
   infirmities, and falls, from which they have been redeemed. [99] And
   their sympathy is more vivid, intense, and pure, because they are set
   free from sin and self. For what but these, our in born evils, are the
   hindrances of our sympathy now in this world? In the midst of our
   truest compassion there is something which rises up to tinge it, and to
   infuse thoughts of self into it. They have the truest sympathy who are
   most perfectly dead to themselves. Therefore, of all the members of
   Christ's mystical body, they must mutually sympathise most perfectly
   who are most free from the taints of evil.

   2. And from this our thoughts ascend to Him who is all-perfect; who
   being from everlasting Very God, was, for our sakes, made very Man,
   that He might unite us wholly to Himself. Above and beyond all sympathy
   is that of our High Priest. It stands alone in its incommunicable
   perfection. "Such an High Priest became us," that is, was required by
   our spiritual necessities, "who is holy, harmless, undefiled, and
   separate from sinners." [100] Because we are sinners, we need One who
   is without sin to sympathise with us. How can it be reverently or
   safely thought that any sympathy can be perfect but His? Does not such
   a thought imply that we do not clearly distinguish what we are speaking
   of? He can not, indeed, partake of the awful knowledge, derived from
   experience, which they possess who have ever consented to sin, who have
   ever been defiled by it. But that knowledge does not perfect sympathy:
   it only mars the perfection of the person. Even the holiest must be
   delivered from this knowledge of sin before their sympathy is raised
   towards His unapproachable tenderness. In one sense it is true, that to
   have been darkened and defiled is the way to learn a bitter knowledge
   of sin. But it is only so because it inflicts on us the miseries which
   follow after sin, and scourges us through repentance to purity of
   heart, whereby we learn its hatefulness. None hate sin but those who
   are holy, and that in the measure of their holiness; and therefore in
   the Person of our blessed Lord there must exist the two great
   conditions of perfect sympathy: first, He has suffered all the sorrows
   and mi series which are consequent upon sin and distinct from it; next,
   He has, because of His perfect holiness, a perfect hatred of evil. And
   these properties of His human nature unite themselves to the pity,
   omniscience, and love, which are the perfections of His divine. To have
   sinned ourselves is not necessary to perfect our sympathy with sinners.
   God forbid the evil thought! Rather, it is the property of spotless
   sanctity to flow forth with the fullest stream of compassion. Who would
   mourn over a sister's fall so intensely as she who is all pure and full
   of sensitive fear of so much as a sullying thought? To have fallen and
   to have repented could add nothing to her intense love and sorrow, to
   her absolute humiliation for another's transgression. Community in sin
   is not the source of sympathy, but participation in holiness. The
   knowledge of the misery of sin which our Lord learned by suffering
   temptation is no doubt far beyond any thing we can learn by consenting
   to it; for it is consent that so far destroys our true perception of
   it. Temptations are far more afflicting to holy minds than falls are to
   the less pure. And all through the life of the truest saint, even while
   the love of God is shed abroad in his heart, and the stillness of
   eternal peace reigns in it, there is, in proportion to the growth of
   sanctity, a growth also in his sorrow for sins long ago repented. His
   past falls come to be more intensely seen and abhorred. It is as he
   recedes from his former self, and passes out of the sphere of his past
   temptations, that he feels all their horror and deadliness. And this
   explains what we see in the lives of the holiest men--that as they have
   visibly advanced in holiness, they have multiplied their acts of
   humiliation and their discipline of repentance; and that instead of
   being thereby drawn from compassion to those who are still in their
   sins, they are of all men the most tender, pitiful, forbearing, and
   compassionate. None live for the conversion of souls so devotedly; none
   have so ready a sorrow for the sins of others; none deal with them so
   lovingly, bind up their wounds so softly, console them, even against
   their own will, so persuasively. And why? Not because of their past
   sin, but because of their present holiness; not for what they have
   been, but for what they are; not because they have been sinners, but
   because they are saints. What they have learned of sin by past consent
   and defilement is a hindrance, not a help, to their true sympathy. They
   attain to this high grace of the mystical body of Christ just as they
   pass out of themselves into Him.

   Now from all this we may see in what it is that our Lord, by the
   experience of humiliation in our flesh, has learned--wonderful
   word!--to sympathise with us.

   Not in any motion of evil in the affections or thoughts of the heart;
   not in any inclination of the will; not, if we dare so much as utter
   it, in any taint or soil upon the soul. Upon all such as are destroying
   themselves in wilful commerce with evil, He looks down with a divine
   pity; but they have withdrawn themselves from the range of His
   sympathy. This can only be with those who are in sorrow under sin; that
   is, with penitents. It is in the suffering of those that would be
   cleansed and made holy that He partakes. Let us now see how we may draw
   comfort from this thought.

   They who have sinned may go to Him in a perfect confidence that He is
   able to "be touched with the feeling of our infirmities." We have
   something in Him to which we may appeal.

   1. We may plead with Him on His own experience of the weakness of our
   humanity. None knows it better than He, not only as our Maker, who
   "knoweth our frame, and remembereth that we are but dust," but as Man,
   who made full trial of our nature "in the days of His flesh." He knows
   its fearful susceptibility of temptation--how in its most perfect
   state, as in His own person, it may be approached and solicited by the
   suggestions and allurements of the evil one. And if in Him it could be
   tempted to sin, how much more in us! May we not believe that it was out
   of the depth of His mysterious obedience that He spoke, when He said:
   "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak?" He did not mean
   sinful flesh only, but humanity itself, the weakness of which was seen
   in Eden, and was proved by Himself in the wilderness, when "He suffered
   being tempted." When we confess our sins before Him, we may lay open
   all. Things we hardly dare to speak to any man, to any imperfect being,
   we do not shrink from confessing before Him--things which men would not
   believe, inward struggles, distinctions in intention, extenuating
   causes, errors of belief,--all the manifold working of the inward life
   which goes before a fall. Imperfect friends treat all these things with
   a hard incredulity, or assign them but a light weight in the favourable
   scale; they fasten only on the prominent features of the case; they
   cannot throw themselves into our position; their knowledge of human
   nature is drawn from their view of their own state and character, often
   flattered and self-deceiving; and that makes them so censorious,
   upbraiding, unmerciful to lapsed sinners, and so suspicious, distant,
   and cold, even to penitents. No doubt the want of vivid faith to
   realise the awfulness of our Lord's presence is partly the reason why
   we are so much readier to make our confessions to Him than to a
   fellow-creature. We feel greatly, in the one case, the reality and the
   penitential character of the act, and little or not at all in the
   other. Again, confession to any man brings a peculiar shame, which our
   secret confessions do not involve. And yet, true as this may be, there
   can be no doubt that there is a more persuasive reason still. It is,
   that with men we are never safe from false judgments, and severe
   because imperfect censures; but with Him is perfect equity, fairness,
   tenderness. With all His awful holiness, there is some thing that draws
   us to Him. Though His eyes be "as a flame of fire," and the act of
   laying ourselves open to Him is terrible, yet He is "meek and lowly of
   heart," knowing all our case, "touched with the feeling of our
   infirmities. *

   So also we must feel towards the elect angels, and all the world
   unseen, whose eyes, St. Paul seems to say, are on us--a cloud of
   gazers, ever looking down upon our course. They, too, in the measure of
   their perfection, are perfect; full of pity and of tender compassion;
   knowing of what spirit their King and Lord is; and like Him in charity
   to us. And yet it is to Him alone that we are drawn to address
   ourselves. Our ultimate account is not with them, but with Him. If He
   be pitiful to us, what more do we need? If He be gracious, they all, as
   comprehended in His perfection, are with us too. If we be sure of His
   sympathy, we are sure of theirs. They cannot satisfy the depth of our
   case, but He can and will.

   We must go to Him, and place ourselves before Him; uncover our shame;
   fall to the earth; pray, if we can speak; if words fail, abase
   ourselves in silence; and let the silence of our confounded souls
   appeal to His sympathy who in the garden "fell on His face" under the
   burden of our infirmities. He will interpret our silence for us, and,
   by His perfect knowledge of our sins, put into our hearts pleas of
   deprecation and solace, which we ourselves neither know nor would dare
   to utter. Wonderful is the Divine justice, and still more the Divine
   equity. He "weigheth the spirits;" He knows the shades and touches of
   our case. What to our dull sight would seem refinements, to His are
   realities in our spiritual probation; and with wonderful tenderness and
   most indulgent forbearance He notes and measures them all. In His
   judgment of penitents He is more gentle than they are to themselves.
   Pleas which they reject, He allows for them. While they are writing
   bitter things against themselves, He is recording the circumstances of
   palliation and excuse. They hardly dare believe that His face is lifted
   up in pity and forgiveness upon them; for His mercy is as great a
   mystery of faith as His Incarnation. "When the Lord turned again the
   captivity of Sion, then were we like unto them that dream." When His
   peace comes down again into our afflicted hearts, then, like the
   apostles, "we believe not for joy and wonder."

   2. Again: we may appeal to His experience of the sorrow and shame which
   come by sin upon mankind. He suffered both as keenly and as fully as it
   was possible for one that was without sin. Wheresoever in the Psalms
   deeper notes of sorrow, lamentations greater than repentance, are
   heard, it is the voice of the Messiah speaking in prophecy. "My God, my
   God, look upon me; why hast Thou forsaken me? why art Thou so far from
   helping me, and from the words of my complaint? O my God, I cry in the
   day-time, but Thou hearest not; and in the night-season also I take no
   rest. . . . As for me, I am a worm, and no man; a very scorn of men,
   and the outcast of the people. All they that see me laugh me to scorn;
   they shoot out their lips, and shake their heads, saying, He trusted in
   God, that He would deliver him; let Him deliver him; if He will have
   him. . . . . I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of
   joint; my heart also in the midst of my body is even like melting wax.
   My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my
   gums, and Thou shalt bring me into the dust of death." [101] "He is
   despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
   grief: and we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and
   we esteemed Him not. Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our
   sorrows: yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and
   afflicted." [102] "Save me, O God; for the waters are come in, even
   unto my soul. I stick fast in the deep mire, where no ground is; I am
   come into deep waters, so that the floods run over me. I am weary of my
   crying: my throat is dry: my sight faileth me for waiting so long upon
   my God. . . . . For Thy sake have I suffered reproof; shame hath
   covered my face. . . . I wept, and chastened myself with fasting; and
   that was turned to my reproof. I put on sackcloth also; and they jested
   upon me. They that sit in the gate speak against me; and the drunkards
   make songs upon. . . . . me Thou hast known my reproof, my shame, and
   my dishonour: mine adversaries are all in Thy sight. Thy rebuke hath
   broken my heart; I am full of heaviness: I looked for some to have pity
   on me, but there was no man, neither found I any to comfort me." [103]
   "O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before Thee:
   oh, let my prayer enter into Thy presence, incline Thine ear unto my
   calling. For my soul is full of trouble; and my life draweth nigh unto
   hell. . . . Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in a place of
   darkness, and in the deep. Thine indignation lieth hard upon me; and
   Thou hast vexed me with all Thy storms. Thou hast put away mine
   acquaintance far from me; and made me to be abhorred of them. I am so
   fast in prison that I cannot get forth. My sight faileth for very
   trouble: Lord, I have called daily upon Thee, I have stretched forth my
   hands unto Thee. . . . . Lord, why abhorrest Thou my soul, and hidest
   Thou Thy face from me? I am in misery, and like unto him that is at the
   point to die: even from my youth up Thy terrors have I suffered with a
   troubled mind. Thy wrathful displeasure goeth over me, and the fear of
   Thee hath undone me." [104] What can we say of this inscrutable mystery
   of sorrow? Who would have dared to apply these words to the Son of God,
   if the Spirit of Christ in prophecy had not already done so by His
   servants? We can only say what the Spirit of Christ Himself hath said.
   Sorrow, fearfulness, shame, scorn, confusion of face, humiliation,
   abasement, exhaustion of body, fainting, trembling, blindness for very
   tears, what ever went beyond all these? "Behold, and see if there be
   any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the
   Lord hath afflicted me in the day of His fierce anger. From above hath
   He sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: He hath
   spread a net for my feet, He hath turned me back: He hath made me
   desolate and faint all the day." [105] What more can we say? All this
   came on Him because God "made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin."
   [106] All that sin could inflict on the guiltless He endured; and to
   that experience of shame and sorrow we guilty may appeal. Though we
   suffer indeed justly, yet can He feel with us though He did nothing
   amiss. Though in the bitterness of soul which flows from consciousness
   of guilt He has no part, yet when we take revenge upon ourselves in
   humiliation, and offer ourselves to suffer all He wills for our
   abasement, He pities us while He permits the chastisement to break us
   down at His feet. He looks in compassion on our heavy hours and
   mournful days, our secret indignation, our shame which burns inwardly,
   our bruised and trembling hearts. When vain remorse and resolution come
   too late, make us smite upon our thigh, and accuse ourselves in secret,
   He--let us hope, believe, and pray--will pity us with a loving and
   tender sympathy. "When our heart is smitten down within us, and
   withered like grass, so that we forget to eat our bread," it is a
   thought full of consolation, "that we have not an high-priest which
   cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities."

   Therefore let us ask for consolation from no other. Let us not go, I
   will not say to the world, and its fair words, smooth persuasions,
   shallow comforts;--for to these no man whose repentance has any depth
   or reality in it can bear to go; they are miserable, falsifying
   stimulants, which heat and bewilder the heart, and leave it open to
   terrible recoils of sorrow but let us not go to books or to employment;
   no, nor even to the consolation and tender love of friend, brother,
   wife, husband, spiritual guide; no, nor to the most perfect saint and
   nearest to Himself; but to Him for whose sake all these must be
   forsaken, in whom are all the fresh springs of solace which distil in
   scanty drops through the tenderest and fondest hearts. Let us go at
   once to Him. We are one with Him, by the mystery of His holy
   Incarnation, by the gift of our new birth. There is nothing can
   separate us from His sympathy but our own wilful sins. Let us fear and
   hate these, as for all other reasons, so above all for this, that they
   cut off the streams of His pure and pitiful consolation, and leave our
   souls to wither up in their own drought and darkness. So long as we are
   fully in His sympathy, let our sorrows, shame, trials, temptations, be
   what they may, we are safe. He is purifying us by them; teaching us to
   die to the world and to ourselves, that He only may live in us, and
   that our life may be "hid with Christ in God."

   And again: that we may so shelter ourselves in Him, let us make to Him
   a confession, detailed, particular, and unsparing, of all our sins. Our
   safest self-examination is made upon our knees; our truest confessions
   are our self-examinations uttered aloud. Let us confess before Him
   morning and night our daily disobedience of thought, word, and deed,
   the forbidden motions of our hearts, the faulty inclinations of our
   will; striving truly and thoroughly to know ourselves, and to lay
   ourselves bare with entire and self-abasing sincerity to Him. In this
   is true peace, deep consolation, calm unspeakable. This will keep our
   hearts waking, recall us when we wander, uphold us when we are weak.
   Whatsoever be our outward lot,--whether we be high or low, esteemed or
   outcast, held in honour or in scorn, trusted or distrusted,--this one
   thing is enough. What more can they desire who have the sympathy of
   Christ? What fellowship do they need who have His hourly presence? When
   men rebuke us, let us thank them, as helping our abasement; when they
   convince us of new faults, let us carry them in confession to our Lord.
   Reproofs are healing balms; censures are "spikenard very precious." The
   more they humble us, the more fully will He admit us to His perfect
   sympathy. O blind and short sighted! when the world looks dark upon us,
   we are afraid. If the great or the many set down our lives as a folly
   or a dream, we begin to doubt, and half to believe what they say. We
   are tempted even to give way before their confident censures and their
   lofty commiseration. We are too proud to be pitied, and would sometimes
   almost conceal and cast off our sympathy with the Cross, that we may
   take our share in the smooth and fair things of the world. But if we be
   His servants, the Cross must be our portion. "The disciple is not above
   his Master, nor the servant above his Lord. It is enough for the
   disciple that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord." [107]
   So that we be His, let us be with this content.

   And lastly, let us so live as not to forfeit His sympathy. It is ours
   only so long as we strive and pray to be made like Him. If we turn
   again to evil, or to the world, we sever ourselves from Him. The
   dominion of any sinful habit will fear fully estrange us from His
   presence. A single consenting act of inward disobedience in thought or
   will is enough to let fall a cloud between Him and us, and to leave our
   hearts cheerless and dark. This all know, who after any sins of the
   temper or spirit, begin their accustomed prayers. They feel themselves
   in a new condition, and at a strange distance from Him; as if in broad
   day the sun had suddenly gone in. And besides positive sins, love of
   the world will shut us out from His sympathy altogether. Love of the
   world casts out the love of Christ. If, in spite of His word and
   warning, His life and cross, we will live on in this fallen world
   without fear or self-denial, as if it were not fallen; if we will love
   it, live in it and for it, accept its flatteries and favours, then we
   must die with it. Follies, laughter, excitement, false happiness, bring
   bitter retrospect, burning consciousness of inconsistency and
   declension; and all these hide His presence from our souls. With these
   He has no sympathy: but only with the humble, bruised, and contrite;
   with them that forsake all that they may find Him, and follow Him
   whither soever He goeth, in darkness and in light, in life and in
   death, counting all things loss, that they may "win Christ and be found
   in Him" in the morning of the resurrection.

SERMON XI.

  SYMPATHY A NOTE OF THE CHURCH.

    ISAIAH lxi. 1.

   "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed
   me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent me to bind up the
   broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of
   the prison to them that are bound."

   THE Person of our blessed Lord is a type of the mystical personality of
   His Church. The notes by which He was manifested to the world as the
   true Messiah are the notes by which also His Church is manifested to
   the world as the true Church. Among many false Christs, there is but
   one true: He came first, and they arose after Him. Among many, there
   was none holy but He alone; none but He was the Saviour of all. "There
   is" but "one God, and one Mediator between God and man." He only is the
   "Holy One of God." He only is "the Saviour of all men," "the Lamb of
   God, that taketh away the sin of the world." He is the one holy,
   universal Saviour of mankind, from whom His Church also derives the
   gifts and properties which are called signs or notes. The prophet
   Isaiah here gives another note, which indeed is not another, but a
   development of the same, by which the true Messiah should be known. He
   was to be the true Healer and Comforter of all, bringing good tidings
   of good, binding up broken hearts, loosing prisoners out of bondage,
   comforting mourners, sympathising with all, drawing all that are
   afflicted to Himself, by the consciousness of their own miseries, and
   by the attractions of His compassion. And this He did by His own divine
   love, by His perfect human sympathy, by His own mysterious experience
   as the Man of Sorrows. This was a note of the true Messiah which none
   could imitate. They might shew . signs and wonders, and utter words of
   wisdom and moving persuasions; make a great shew of holiness and pity
   for man kind, and draw away many after them; but the reality was
   wanting: the meek and the broken hearted, the prisoner, the bondsman,
   and the mourner, had in them something too deep, vivid, and piercing,
   to find rest until the one only and true Messiah should appear.

   Now it is to this that we find our Lord Himself appealing in proof of
   His divine commission. Immediately after He had been manifested by the
   descent of the Holy Ghost in His baptism, and had been tempted of the
   devil in the wilderness, we read that He "returned in the power of the
   Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of Him through all the
   region round about. And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified
   of all. And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as
   His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and
   stood up for to read. And there was delivered unto Him the book of the
   prophet Esaias. And when He had opened the book, He found the place
   where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, be cause He
   hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to
   heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
   recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are
   bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. And He closed the
   book, and He gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes
   of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on Him. And He
   began to say unto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your
   ears. And all bare Him witness, and wondered at the gracious words
   which proceeded out of His mouth." [108]

   And soon after we read: "Now when the sun was setting, all they that
   had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto Him; and He laid
   His hands on every one of them, and healed them. And devils also came
   out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God.
   And He rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that He
   was Christ." [109]

   Again: "And He came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the
   company of His disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all
   Judea and Jerusalem, and from the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, which
   came to hear Him, and to be healed of their diseases; and they that
   were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed. And the whole
   multitude sought to touch Him: for there went virtue out of Him, and
   healed them all. And He lifted up His eyes on His disciples, and said,
   Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God." [110]

   Again we read: "John, calling unto him two of his disciples, sent them
   to Jesus, saying, Art Thou He that should come? or look we for an
   other? When the men were come unto Him, they said, John Baptist hath
   sent us unto Thee, saying, Art Thou He that should come? or look we for
   another? And in the same hour He cured many of their infirmities and
   plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind He gave
   sight. Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John
   what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame
   walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to
   the poor the Gospel is preached." [111]

   Such was the whole life of our blessed Lord. He was at all times
   encompassed by the multitude of sick and poor, widowed and desolate,
   mourners and penitents; all day long "there were many coming and
   going;" and He and His disciples had at times no leisure "so much as to
   eat." [112] They came "from all cities and villages," and "from all the
   country round about,"--Jews, Samaritans, Syro-Phomicians, Greeks, and
   Gentiles; some to hear His words, some to touch the hem of His garment,
   some to ask Him to "speak the word only," that they might be made
   whole. He was the one only and all-sufficient Healer and Consoler of
   the sorrows of all flesh. And He drew to Him all that mourned in sins,
   in sicknesses, in desolation of heart. They clung to Him as their true
   and only Rest. In Him they found the answer to all their perplexities,
   to all their troubles of heart; He was the true solace of all their
   anguish. His words, His touch, His very looks of pity, soothed and
   healed their woes in body and in spirit. He was "a strength to the
   poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm,
   a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones" was "as a
   storm against the wall." The prophecy was fulfilled in Him: "A man
   shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the
   tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great
   rock in a weary land." [113]

   Such was His character and ministry; and such is the character and
   ministry of His mystical body, which is the Church. The anointing which
   was upon Him flowed down from the Head to the members. It consecrated
   apostles, prophets, martyrs, and saints: they were like Him, and
   prolonged His ministry on earth not so much by imitation as by union
   and incorporation with Him--by actual participation of the spirit,
   sympathy, and mind of Jesus Christ. So we find after His ascension. The
   Holy Ghost came upon them in the day of Pentecost, and thenceforward
   they opened their work of compassion and of spiritual mercy by works of
   healing and by words of consolation. It was indeed the dispensation of
   the Comforter: the Church was the almoner of the poor, the physician of
   souls, the solace of the afflicted; it spoke peace, forgiveness,
   ransom, purity, gladness of heart, to all. And after the descent of the
   Spirit, the Church passed into that truest discipline of sympathy, the
   experience of sorrow. It was led, as it were, into the wilderness. In
   all the world it was tempted of the devil; by allurements and by
   afflictions he fought against it, making it thereby, and against his
   intent, to be partaker of the sufferings of Christ. Christians were
   sons of consolation, because they were men of sorrows; they inherited
   the title and the office of their Lord; they were called to "fill up
   that which was behind of the afflictions of Christ in the flesh, for
   His body's sake, which is the Church." [114] It was this that gave to
   the apostolical ministry such a divine and persuasive power. All the
   world answered to its voice, because in all the earth there were the
   same afflictions, and in the Church the same power to heal. From the
   time of the humiliation of the Son of God, sorrow, suffering, and pain
   became sacred and holy. To the poor was given the first place in
   Christ's earthly kingdom: widows, orphans, and mourners were so many
   distinct orders, whom the Church nourished and consoled; little
   children were among its chiefest cares. The infirmities of human
   nature, old age and sickness, were more sacred still, and were tended
   with a greater love; for besides natural compassion in its most perfect
   form, the body of Christ was quickened by His divine sympathy. By the
   anointing of the Holy Ghost, charity and tenderness were shed abroad in
   the hearts of His disciples; and, above all, they knew that, in
   ministering consolation to sorrow and suffering, they were ministering
   to Him who in our nature had made suffering and sorrow peculiarly His
   own. "Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My brethren,
   ye did it unto Me." This is the true secret of the wonderful fact, that
   hospitals for the sick, poor, aged, and strangers, homes for the
   outcast and desolate, are peculiar to the Church of Christ. Heathenism
   had none. The cold and stately cities of the heathen world had no
   hospitals or houses of mercy. The very name of hospital was not in
   their language, because the grace of charity was not in their nature.
   Neither had they spiritual consolations, because the very idea of
   repentance and contrition was unknown. It was by the mystery of the
   Incarnation, and the coming of the Holy Ghost, by the regeneration of
   the faithful, by the knitting together of the members of Christ's
   mystical body, that the ministries of repentance and consolation were
   opened to mankind. The whole visible system of hospitals, asylums,
   almshouses, and the like, are the expression and means of fulfilling
   the ends of mercy for which the Messiah was anointed by the Spirit of
   the Lord. It is His commission which was opened in the synagogue at
   Nazareth, extended throughout the earth, and prolonged unto this day.
   This is the peculiar note and office of the Catholic Church. It was not
   the work of civil powers, nor could be. Christian states have borrowed
   the principle, and reproduced cold and remote imitations of catholic
   charity; but the true test is, to look at political governments before
   Christ came into the world. Take Athens and Rome, the greatest and most
   vaunted polities the world ever saw as detached from Christianity. What
   did they for the alleviation of human sorrows in body or in spirit?
   Refinement, and civilisation, and warlike greatness, and high-sounding
   patriotism, and subtil philosophy, what did all these for the poor and
   miser able? Sorry comforters are the men of this world at their best
   estate. It may be very unpalatable and offensive to statesmen and
   politicians to be told, that they can do little or nothing more than
   borrow grace and wisdom of the Church they despise and patronise. Yet
   so it is. Kingdoms and states can retain the semblance and organisation
   of charity only so long as the Church quickens the mass of a people and
   the frame of government with its life. As that declines or withdraws
   itself, the distributions of state-charity dry up, and we hear of
   famishing poor and spiritual destitution. So also with Christian sects.
   Whatsoever of charity they have among them is borrowed of the Church,
   and belongs to it. Their institutions, few and scanty as they are, do
   but copy and imitate the ministries of manifold charity through which
   the mystical body of Christ consoles meek, bro ken-hearted, and
   mourning spirits. And imitations as they are, they are
   short-lived--they die out. It has ever been an axiom in the Church,
   "The branch cut off withers, the stream cut off dries up." At the
   outset, sects are always distinguished by a great profession of
   sympathy with the spiritual and bodily sufferings of mankind. They
   found themselves on the alleged neglect or inability of the Church to
   minister to the contrite and afflicted. Their strength lies in their
   popularity, in a moving affectionateness and forward profession of
   disinterested solicitude, and in stealing away the hearts of the
   people. As Absalom said, "Oh that I were made judge in the land, that
   every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would
   do him justice! And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do
   him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him."
   [115] But this lasts only for a time. The first zeal dies when the
   point is gained; labour and care grow slack, and self-denying charity
   cold and scant; the system relaxes, and shews inherent weakness; makes
   many attempts to rally, and for a time seems to succeed; but is always
   going down, losing its hold on men's hearts, and with its hold losing
   its power of unity and control. At last men forsake it, be cause the
   deep yearnings of their hearts meet no sympathy; there is nothing to
   stay their souls on. They are stirred, excited, and vexed by its soli
   citations and upbraidings, its high-sounding words and cold affections;
   and in the end they are repelled by its antipathies, and fall into
   irreligion, or are drawn away by strong vital attractions of fervent
   charity in the Church. So end all schisms; sooner or later they cease
   to be. Howsoever long they may simulate the notes of the Church, adopt
   its language, and affect its charity, they sink by mere exhaustion at
   last. "Every plant which My heavenly Father hath not planted shall be
   rooted up." [116]

   1. What has been said will shew us the benefit of affliction to the
   Church. It is most certain that it was never so like to its Divine Head
   as when it suffered for His name's sake. It was never so full of the
   Holy Ghost, of humiliation, penitence, love, compassion, and unity, as
   in the ages of persecution. It cost too much in those days to be a
   member of the Catholic Church for any to venture upon it but such as
   were willing to "lose their life for Christ's sake and the gospel,"
   that they might "find it unto life eternal." They were knit together in
   a community of truth and spirit, of sufferings and sorrows; and the
   true sympathy of the members of one body ran through out the whole. But
   when the tide began to turn, and the world to shine upon the Church, it
   was an easy and cheap thing to be a Christian; and it grew to be a
   custom and a fashion, and multitudes of cold, worldly, unsympathising
   men mingled themselves in the Church, and lowered its tone. As it has
   grown prosperous, it has left off to sympathise with the same vivid
   compassion for the sufferings of humanity. And yet through all ages of
   the Church there has been a succession of saints dead to the world,
   likened to Christ, bearing the tokens of the Cross, disciplined in
   sorrow, full of living sympathy with the sufferings of the poor and
   penitent. Individual characters indeed have come out with an energy and
   intensity like apostles and martyrs. Sometimes they have kindled and,
   for a while, have stirred whole churches to the same fervent charity.
   But the secret of their perfection was still the same, that they were
   partakers of their Master's cross, and that by sorrow they were endowed
   with the gift of compassion and of love. The grace of their
   regeneration had been developed by the things that they had suffered.
   Outward crosses helped their inward mortification, and wrought for
   their perfection. They were endowed with a large measure of that
   anointing whereby their Lord was consecrated to preach the gospel to
   the poor, to heal the broken-hearted, and to comfort them that mourn.
   It is most certain that the Church has never been less in sympathy with
   the inner world of spiritual sorrow than when it has been outwardly
   prosperous. And from this we may derive a great consolation. Whatsoever
   adversity be upon us, it is manifestly a token not only of God's love,
   but of God's purpose to make us fitter for His work of mercy to the
   world. Just as these latter days set in upon us, and the first days
   seem to return in the last, just so may we all the more believe that He
   is calling His Church from earthly greatness, civil power, visible
   offices of counsel and authority in states and kingdoms, to its
   original separation from the world, to a life of unity, and to higher
   spiritual gifts.

   Surely we may say of the Church what St. Paul says of individuals. If
   it be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then must it be
   of a doubtful legitimacy, and its commission to witness for God in the
   world of no certain war rant. There is something to fear in the sight
   of a Church easy, peaceful, prosperous, well furnished with goods,
   confident of its own purity and of its own right judgment in all
   things. There is fear that it is, or will become, unsympathising,
   self-regarding, delicate, unhumbled; that it will one day hear from the
   mouth out of which goeth the sharp two-edged sword: "Thou sayest, I am
   rich, and in creased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest
   not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
   naked. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
   mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and
   that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes
   with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and
   chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent." [117] And this shews us how
   needless are our popular alarms. Many good men, when they see the
   outward system of the Church threatened, think the Church is in danger.
   Ought we not rather to say, that then it is safe--safe from surfeit and
   self-trusting, from hollowness and unreality; safe from false
   confidence, high thoughts of itself, and from the pride which goeth
   before a fall? Nay, even those greater chastisements and dangers--the
   persevering attempts of sectarian bodies to alienate the hearts of its
   people, and the loss of many of its members by estrangement and
   perversion--even in these too there is safety. They are rebukes of love
   to deepen the interior life of the Church, to quicken a sense of
   compunction, to work in it the grace of humiliation, to raise the tone
   of its sympathy and the wisdom of its spiritual guides, to mature
   within it the gift of meekness, contrition, and spiritual mourning, and
   thereby to bring out into energy and act the great note of consolation
   and compassion which revealed the true Messiah at His coming.

   2. Another thing we may learn from what has been said is, the design of
   God in afflicting the several members of the Church. It is to make them
   partakers of this true note of Christ's mystical body. We are all by
   nature hard and unsympathising. By our regeneration we learn to see the
   great truth of Christian compassion: we receive the grace through which
   we may be perfected in love to the members of Christ: but it lies
   dormant in us, until by the visitations of His hand it is unfolded into
   contrition and spiritual sorrow. It is God's deepest way of teaching:
   and what we learn by affliction is our truest learning. We are thereby
   brought to know things by tasting their reality. The mystery of sin in
   us, of which we are so unconscious, becomes a vivid sense of personal
   unworthiness, and a source of deep humiliation and sorrow of heart. And
   these things make men strangely gentle and tender to others, full of
   pity and a softer tone. As they are taught to be themselves meek and
   contrite, so they learn also the exceeding fulness of the consolation
   which is in God; and that secret of consolation is shewn to them not
   for their own sakes alone, but for the sake of others. They are thereby
   constituted messengers of consolation, channels of the sympathy of
   Christ. As St. Paul says to the Corinthians, "Blessed be God, even the
   Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of
   all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be
   able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith
   we ourselves are comforted of God. For as the sufferings of Christ
   abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. And whether
   we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is
   effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer:
   or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation."
   [118] It is God's way of dealing with us, to make those by whom He will
   comfort others, first to go themselves through the darkness and
   realities of the world of sorrow. Buoyancy, high spirits, untamed
   vigour, great health of body, inexperience of the changes of life, make
   even the most amiable of men unapt to console the suffering and
   sorrowful. They cannot enter into the depth and reality of their
   trials. They are out of place in sick-rooms. Houses of mourning are not
   their natural home. With the kindest intentions and most sincere desire
   to minister comfort, they do not know what to say, or how to address
   themselves to the offices of consolation. There is an admonition in the
   fact, that our blessed Lord was tempted before He began His ministry.
   It was the discipline, if we may so speak, of His perfect sympathy. So
   is it with His servants. And this goes far to explain the trials which
   fall chiefly on the most favoured of His members; on those that partake
   His office of love; on those who minister to His mystical body.

   Therefore, whatsoever trial comes upon us, let us not shrink from it,
   nor lose any part of the full lesson of humiliation which it is sent to
   teach. Let us fully give ourselves to it, to suffer all it has to lay
   on us. There are, it may be, deeper things to be known of our own
   sinfulness than we can know without the teaching of some special
   chastisements. By them we learn to be severe to none but to ourselves;
   to be gentle to the sins of others, as He that breaks not the bruised
   reed, while we are unsparing to our own. It is by the knowledge that we
   are frail, and that we dwell on the very brink of great falls, if the
   grace of God should be for a moment withdrawn; by this we learn to pity
   them that are fallen, "to heal the broken-hearted," "to set at liberty
   them that are bruised." If He should deal with us as we deal with each
   other, who should stand in His sight? What unfair constructions, what
   hard views of the falls and failings, what hasty censures and
   unmerciful interpretations of other men do we indulge in! If we were
   true penitents; if we had learned the great lesson of humiliation; if
   we knew how to say with St. Paul, "For this cause I obtained mercy,
   that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a
   pattern to them which should here after believe on Him to life
   everlasting;" [119] then we should learn to be gentle in eye, hand, and
   heart, towards the sins and humiliations of our brethren. For this
   reason He sometimes lets us fall, to break our harsh, unsympathising
   nature, and puts on us a yoke of secret shame, which makes us for ever
   to look with tenderness and compunction on the sins of others.

   So likewise in the sorrows of sickness or bereavement. None know the
   unspeakable depth of such wounds but they who have endured them. It is
   all in vain to try to imagine their keen and penetrating anguish; how
   they make the whole soul faint, and the whole heart sick. Sorrow is a
   season of peculiar temptations; and there are very few who do not yield
   to waywardness, selfishness, or irritation, when the affliction is upon
   them. How deeply do they resent the want of vivid sympathy in others!
   What thoughts and feelings of unkindness find their way into wounded
   hearts, and make all their wounds tenfold more piercing!

   If we truly knew what sorrow is, we should count it a high calling to
   be allowed to minister the least word of consolation to the afflicted.
   Therefore if we be called to suffer, let us under stand it to be a call
   to a ministry of healing. God is setting us apart to a sort of pastoral
   office, to the care of the sick of His flock. There is a hidden
   ministry which works in perfect harmony with the orders of His Church;
   a ministry of secret comfort, diffusing itself by the power of sympathy
   and prayer. Within His visible Church are many companies of sorrow,
   many that weep alone, a fellowship of secret mourners; and to them the
   contrite and humbled are perpetually ministering, shed ding peace,
   often unawares. Things that they have learned in seasons of affliction,
   long-pondered thoughts, realities learned by suffering, perceptions of
   God's love and presence,--all these are put in trust with them for the
   consolation of His elect. They know not oftentimes to whom they speak.
   Perhaps they have never seen them, nor ever shall. Unknown to each
   other, they are knit in bonds higher than all ties of blood; they are
   joined and constituted in that higher unity which is the order of
   Christ's kingdom. When all the relations of this lower life shall be
   dissolved, the bonds of their heavenly kindred shall be revealed.
   Mourners and comforters shall meet at last in the holy city. "And God
   shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more
   death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain:
   for the former things are passed away." [120]

SERMON XII.

  THE HOLINESS OF COMMON LIFE.

    ST. MARK vi. 3.

   "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and
   Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not His sisters here with us?
   And they were offended at Him."

   ST. MATTHEW, in relating the same event, tells us that they said, "Is
   not this the carpenter's son?" Such was the repute in which He was held
   in His own country, where we should have thought that an awe would have
   rested upon the hearts of all; and that His perfect meekness would have
   won their love. "When He was come into His own country, He taught them
   in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said,
   Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? . . . . And
   they were offended in Him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not
   without honour save in his own country, and in his own house. And He
   did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief." [121] Now
   it cannot but appear very strange, that our Lord Jesus Christ should
   have been so like to other men that they should not have discovered Him
   to be something greater than themselves. We should have thought that
   the events attending first the annunciation, then His birth, the
   revelations to the shepherds and to the wise men, the warnings of God
   to Joseph, should have in some way come abroad, and invested the Child
   Jesus with awe and mystery; or, if these things were kept secret, yet
   we should have thought that there must have been in His very gestures
   and words some indications which should have made people expect from
   Him something more than from other men. Yet it would appear that for
   thirty years He lay hid, living among them unheeded, speaking and
   acting in the common way of men, so that He passed for the carpenter's
   son, Himself a carpenter, dwelling among His kinsmen, brethren and
   sisters as they are here called. They treated Him as one of themselves.
   Not only in the Temple at Jerusalem, where He might be unknown, did
   they ask, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?" [122]
   but here, in His own city, they asked, in surprise and incredulity,
   "Whence hath this man this wisdom?" From all this it would seem plain,
   that our blessed Redeemer did not greatly differ, in what may be called
   His private life, from those about Him; that He dwelt under the roof of
   Joseph and Mary, in childhood subject to them, in manhood serving them
   with a perfect filial duty, in plainness, poverty, retirement. He, in
   whom dwelt the fulness of the Godhead bodily, the brightness of His
   Father's glory, and the express image of His Person, lay so concealed
   in the paths of ordinary life, that His own townsmen knew Him only as
   the carpenter, as an unnoted member of Joseph's household.

   Now there are some very important practical truths to be drawn from
   this fact: truths full both of comfort and of instruction to many kinds
   of people. What is more common than to hear people excusing themselves
   from the obligation of leading a devout life, on the plea that they are
   compelled to mix with the world? Others, again, who earnestly desire to
   keep themselves unspotted from the world, are exceedingly distressed at
   the distractions and hindrances of society. Some think that all high
   counsels of devotion are for solitaries, or persons whom God has called
   out of the tumult of the world to serve Him in the shelter of sorrow,
   sickness, or retirement. They give up the very thought of aiming at
   higher attainments; they call them visionary, unpractical, impossible.
   And even those who earnestly strive to live above the context of life
   by which they are surrounded, are tempted to think that, if they would
   live nearer to God, they must abandon life and its manifold exactions.

   We may learn, then, from this view of our Lord's example:

   1. First, that the holiest of men may to all outward eyes appear
   exactly like other people. For in what does holiness consist but in a
   due fulfilment of the relative duties of our state in life, and in
   spiritual fellowship with God?

   Now the relative duties of life are universal. Every man has his own.
   There is nothing peculiar but that which belongs to each man's peculiar
   station, and that station explains away the peculiarity of his acts and
   ways. Whatever we are, high or lowly, learned or unlearned, married or
   single, in a full house or alone, charged with many affairs or dwelling
   in quietness, we have our daily round of work, our duties of affection,
   obedience, love, mercy, industry, and the like; and that which makes
   one man to differ from another is not so much what things he does, as
   his manner of doing them. Two men, the most opposite in character, may
   dwell side by side, and do the very same daily acts, but in the sight
   of God be as far apart as light and darkness. Saints and sinners may
   alike fulfil the visible acts of their several callings in life; but
   with what diversity of motives, with what contradiction of aims, with
   what opposite tempers, purposes, affections of heart! The very same
   round of acts may be to one man the subject-matter of a holy life, to
   another the occasion of habitual offences. At all events, the habit of
   life in each is ostensibly the same, and there is nothing peculiar or
   remarkable in those things in which sinners and saints alike partake.
   The commonplace familiar aspect of every-day life draws a veil over the
   inward posture and actings of the mind, as over the holiness of our
   Lord. And if in these things holy men are not outwardly distinguishable
   from others, they are still less so in the spiritual fellowship which
   is between themselves and God. Into this no eye but that which seeth in
   secret can enter. No man can say what passes in the closet when the
   door is shut; in secret meditations at eventide; in nightly vigils; in
   wakings before the morning-watch; in days when the spirit goes softly
   before God, with fasting, and compunction, and tears which flow
   inwardly upon the soul.

   2. Again: we may learn, what, indeed, is implied though not expressed
   in the text, that true holiness is not made up of extraordinary acts.
   We may say in this as the Apostle asked of the Church in Corinth: "Are
   all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of
   miracles? have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do
   all interpret?" [123] Although we know, indeed, and in cooler and
   clearer moments acknowledge, that it is not only those who are called
   of God to great and emphatic works of faith and charity, that are truly
   devout; yet we are some how often tempted to overstep the lines which
   are drawn along our ordinary path. This is especially true of persons
   at the outset of a religious life, or in the first awakening of
   repentance, or under the deep thrilling impressions of God's presence
   in sorrows or afflictions. We are tempted to give way to excited
   feelings, to exaggerated words, to unnecessary and almost ostentatious
   acts; and that with no desire to be seen of men, and to have our
   miserable reward in this world, but because we fancy that common things
   do not give scope enough for a devoted life; that a wider field, and
   broader lines, and bolder strokes, are needed.

   And this no doubt is the secret of many grave and sometimes
   irremediable mistakes. Sometimes? under the belief that in an ordinary
   life of duty they could not serve God with devotion, men have left
   their plain path of duty, and committed themselves suddenly to holy
   orders; or they have made sacrifices of which they have afterwards
   repented; or bound themselves by vows which have turned to yokes and
   snares; or, like the foolish builder, have committed themselves to
   public professions, which they have afterwards shamefully abandoned.
   Now what is all this, but the mistake that holiness is to be attained
   more easily by going out of our ordinary path than by abiding in it?
   But if there be any thing true, it is this: that, for the greater part
   of men, the most favourable discipline of holiness will be found
   exactly to coincide with the ordinary path of duty; and that it will be
   most surely promoted by repressing the wanderings of imagination, in
   which we frame to ourselves states of life and habits of devotion
   remote from our actual lot, and by spending all our strength in those
   things, great or small, pleasing or unpalatable, which belong to our
   calling and position.

   3. And, once more, we may learn, that any man, whatsoever be his
   outward circumstances of life, may reach to any the highest point of
   devotion. I do not say that all states of life are equally favourable;
   far from it; but that outward circumstances are only hindrances, not
   absolute prohibitions. It is most true, that they who are permitted by
   the Providence of God to withdraw from worldly employments, to wait at
   His altar, to be content with food and raiment, to live lives of
   self-denial, in works of love and spiritual mercy, being themselves
   without carefulness, and disburdened of the many things which cumber
   other Christians; that is, in one word, who are permitted to choose
   with Mary that "one thing needful," "that good part which shall not be
   taken away from" them; most true it is, that such persons may, and do,
   for the most part, more surely and deeply than others, perfect in their
   souls the work of humiliation, penitence, and devotion.

   But this is a lot not given to all. And it is most certain, that for
   those who are not called from the duties of the world and the cares of
   life, the path in which God is pleased to lead them must be the best
   and safest. Nay, one among the wisest of the Church's early teachers
   [124] tells us that the most perfect man is he who, in the midst of the
   charges, and cares, and relations of life and home, yet attends upon
   the Lord without distraction. Such a way of life will indeed require
   greater spiritual strength. For worldly cares weigh down the soul, and.
   entangle it in manifold obstructions. To be in the world, and yet dead
   to it, is the highest reach of faith.

   But there is no need for the great multitude of Christians to weigh
   these states in a balance against each other. This at least is most
   certain, and makes all such comparisons unprofitable--I mean, that
   there is hardly one of us whose out ward circumstances in life do not
   admit of a far higher reach of devotion than we actually attain. We
   repine at the obstructions of our outward lot, as if they were the
   cause of our wandering thoughts, careless hearts, selfish wishes,
   inattentive prayers, unchastened tempers, languid affections. We think
   we should do better in some other condition, under some other
   circumstances, with somewhat less of ordinary life, and somewhat more
   of uncommon events and practices. And yet the hindrance is not from
   without but within us. It is not only in the household, or in the
   market-place, or at the seat of custom, or in the crowd of men, that
   this, which makes our religious character imperfect, cleaves to us, and
   defeats our washes and intentions. We should carry it with us into a
   cell. It would lower the tone of our devotions in a solitude, or even
   at the foot of the altar: for what is it but the want of fervour and
   perseverance , a lack of inward force and of spiritual affections? What
   do the examples of Holy Scripture teach us? They shew us that those who
   have been called to serve God out of the world, so to speak, are few;
   and that they who have served Him in the world are the multitude of His
   saints. Samuel was brought up in the temple; Elijah dwelt in Carmel;
   Elisha in the school of the prophets; John Baptist in the wilderness;
   the Apostles forsook all for Christ's sake and the Gospel: but Enoch
   walked with God, and had sons and daughters; Abraham had great
   possessions; Joseph governed Egypt; Moses was king in Jeshurun; [125]
   Jeremiah dwelt in a royal court; Daniel was third ruler in the kingdom
   of Babylon; Nehemiah was prince and governor in Jerusalem.

   So in all ages the saints of the Church have been mingled in all the
   duties and toils of life, until age or the events of Providence set
   them free. There was nothing uncommon about most of them but their
   holiness. Their very lot in life ministered to them occasions of
   obedience and humiliation. They sought God fervently in the turmoil of
   homes and armies, of camps and courts; and He revealed Himself to them
   in love, and became the centre about which they moved, and the rest of
   all their affections.

   There is no reason why we should not likewise live unto God, whatsoever
   be our trade, labour, profession, or state. A poor mother may live
   after the example of the Blessed Virgin in lowliness and thoughtful
   care, pondering in her heart, watching over her children, and fostering
   them for God, leading them up to His temple, teaching them betimes to
   be about their heavenly Father's business. Children may grow up in
   affection, patience, gentleness, and uniform obedience, like our Lord.
   A poor labouring man may live by the sweat of his face, tilling the
   earth, or working with the tools of his craft, as "the Carpenter" at
   His toil, and yet have his "life hid with Christ in God." States men,
   merchants, lawyers, soldiers, all they who "maintain the state of the
   world," may reach to any height of Christian devotion. There is no
   limit to their advance, except in the measure of their own energy,
   zeal, self-discipline, and purity of heart.

   What has been said may suggest many thought! of comfort in the present
   state of the Church among us. It cannot be denied that the visible
   marks of sanctity are but faintly seen. The world has out grown the
   Church, and left its character and impressions every where. In the
   whole civil and social state, in public and private life, in our
   sciences of government and schemes of civilisation, in our
   institutions, undertakings, and usages, that which meets us every where
   is the world, its powers, wisdom, self-trusting, its softness, polish,
   and refinement. The notes of the Church are suppressed and seldom seen:
   the counsels, precepts, laws of holy living, the public solemnities of
   a visible religion, are well nigh withdrawn from our personal,
   domestic, and political life. Where are the high days of the Church's
   joy, as in the former days of old? The very consolations of Holy
   Scripture have become unmeaning to us. Who knows what is promised when
   it is said, "Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy
   solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe
   to come into the mountain of the Lord, to the mighty One of Israel?"
   [126] Where are our feasts of Christian joy? Chilled off into a
   formality, which to the multitude is tame, wearisome, and inexpressive;
   or the mercies of God are suffered to pass without any token of
   acknowledgment. And for our public fasts, even Nineveh shall rise up in
   the judgment and condemn us. "The people of Nineveh believed God, and
   proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even
   to the least of them. For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he
   arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him
   with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. And he caused it to be proclaimed and
   published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles,
   saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let
   them not feed, nor drink water: but let man and beast be covered with
   sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God." [127] But we have come to
   partake in great public wrongs, and can bear to be smitten by awful
   public chastisements, without confession or humiliation. And, moreover,
   those visible institutions and privileged rules of life by which
   repentance, devotion, and charity manifested themselves in other days,
   are gone. The surface of religion among us is a monotonous plain,
   unbroken by variety; marked by few visible features of devotion,
   standing out in relief from the level of ordinary life.

   We may hope, indeed, that these things are the excess of a recoil from
   a popular system, which may have been more visible than real; and that
   the secrecy of private devotion is a sensitive and not unwise
   retirement, into which men are provoked by the coarse and unfeeling
   exhibition of fanatical and self-conscious professors. Let us hope that
   there is vet a severe reality at heart, that men have been taught to
   apprehend with an intense and even over strained interpretation the
   words of our Lord in the midst of an ostentatious and obtrusive
   religious profession: "Take heed that ye do not your alms before men,
   to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is
   in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
   before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets,
   that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their
   reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
   right hand doeth: that thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father
   which seeth in secret, Himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou
   prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray
   standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they
   may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But
   thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut
   thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which
   seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. . . . . Moreover when ye
   fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they
   disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I
   say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest,
   anoint thine head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not unto men to
   fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father which
   seeth in secret shall reward thee openly." [128] It is, I think,
   certainly true, that what the confusions and worldliness of these
   latter days have made inevitable, these words have been understood even
   to enjoin; and we may therefore take great comfort in the thought, that
   under the cold, naked exterior of our public religion, and the reserve
   of private habits, there does exist a deep and severe reality of
   spiritual life; that under the most unlikely and adverse appearance
   there lies hidden a real work of mortification. We read even of a king
   of Israel, "that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall,
   and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his
   flesh." [129] Let us hope that God, who weigheth the spirits, does
   discern the deep moving of the inmost heart, the tokens of the cross,
   the mind of Christ, in those who, to us, seem no more than just,
   temperate, amiable, and gentle; and that many who appear to be drifting
   to and fro on the waterflood, are held by "an anchor of the soul, sure
   and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil." [130] God
   only knows. We may perhaps have spoken, and even dwelt, with men who
   had in them the mind of apostles and martyrs. We have known them only
   by their outward aspect, as they who said in His own country, "Is not
   this the carpenter?"

   Let us hope this, I say, of others: but we must do more than hope it of
   ourselves; here there can be no mistaking. We are within the closet
   even when the door is shut. What is seen by our Father in secret is not
   hidden from us. Whether or no there be, under our every-day life, the
   devotion of a saintly mind, can be no matter of doubt to those who
   desire to know themselves. It is plain, from what has been said, that
   if it be not so with us, the fault is not in our outward state, nor in
   its circumstances, but in ourselves. We may therefore rest assured,
   that the duties of the day and fellowship with God are enough to lead
   us on to any measure of Christian perfection. But these must not be
   separated. It is impossible for us to make the duties of our lot
   minister to our sanctification without a habit of devout fellowship
   with God. This is the spring of all our life, and the strength of it.
   It is prayer, meditation, and converse with God, that refreshes,
   restores, and renews the temper of our minds, at all times, under all
   trials, after all conflicts with the world, when our own carnal will
   and frailty has betrayed us to our fall, and breaches have been made in
   our most stedfast resolutions. By this contact with the world unseen we
   receive continual accesses of strength. The counter- working of the
   world is thereby held in check. As our day, so is our strength. With
   out this healing and refreshing of spirit, duties grow to be burdens,
   the events of life chafe our temper, employments lower the tone of our
   minds, and we become fretful, irritable, and impatient. Our outward
   circumstances become provocations and offences. A busy life, or one
   that is full of this world's duties and gifts, needs much devotion to
   sanctify it. The less directly our outward lot disposes us towards
   inward holiness, the more need have we of recollection,
   self-chastisement, and prayer. Without these we shall never be able to
   walk with circumspection, in gentleness, sincerity, pureness, and love.
   Our hidden life with God is the very soul of our spiritual being in our
   own home, in the church, and in the world.

   And so also, on the other hand, it is impossible for us to live in
   fellowship with God without holiness in all the relative duties of
   life. These things act and react on each other. Without a diligent and
   faithful obedience to the calls and claims of others upon us, our
   religious profession is simply dead. To disobey conscience when it
   points to relative duties irritates the whole temper, and quenches the
   first beginnings of devotion. We cannot go from strife, breaches, and
   angry words, to God. Selfishness, an imperious will, want of sympathy
   with the sufferings and sorrows of other men, neglect of charitable
   offices, suspicions, hard censures of those with whom our lot is cast,
   will miserably darken our own hearts and hide the face of God from us.
   It is mere folly to go from a breach of the second great commandment to
   attempt the fulfilment of the first. When a man is ill at ease with
   others, he is sure to be so with God. That much-abused proverb is most
   true, "Charity begins at home." It is but Pharisaism and self-delusion
   for a man that is "a lion in his house and frantic among his servants"
   [131] to make profession of prayer and fellowship with the Lamb of God.

   Let this, then, be our token. Let us whose lot is cast in these latter
   times, when the Church has once more become almost hidden in the world,
   be of the holy fellowship of Him who to the eyes of men was only the
   carpenter, but in the eyes of God was the very Christ. Let us look well
   to our daily duties. The least of them is a wholesome discipline of
   humiliation: if, indeed, any thing can be little which may be done for
   God. If we were worthy of greater things, He would call us: if He do
   not, He bids us to know ourselves better, to mortify vanity and high
   thoughts of our own powers to do Him service. Every state has its
   peculiar graces. They who are blessed with full homes and many friends
   are called to goodness, mercy, long-suffering, tender affection towards
   the burdened and afflicted. The Jews would have no man to be a judge
   but one that had children, that he might know how to shew mercy as a
   father. There is a discipline of humanity in the cares and burdens of
   life which mellows the hearts of the just. Joseph is their type and
   example. Others are otherwise led and disposed of, and are thereby
   called to toil, hardness, deadness to self, patience, humiliation; to
   be content with God alone; to have charity to God's elect, boldness for
   the truth, suffering for the Church, and to receive in the "body the
   marks of the Lord Jesus."

SERMON XIII.

  THE WORLD WE HAVE RENOUNCED.

    ST. JOHN xv. 18, 19.

   "If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me before it hated you.
   If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye
   are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore
   the world hateth you."

   PERHAPS there is no word more commonly in our mouths than the world;'
   and yet hardly any to which we attach less clear and certain meaning.
   Indeed, the sense intended by it varies according to the character of
   the person that uses it. Some people denounce the world as unmixed
   evil; some say it is for the most part good, or at least innocent; some
   profess to see its deceitful workings every where; some will see them
   no where: some make their religion to consist in a separation from the
   world; some think the field of their religious duty is in the world: in
   a word, there is little or no agreement or certainty but in this, that
   there is such a power and reality as the world, and that it is of great
   moment to us to know what it is. Let us therefore endeavour to come at
   something better than these floating notions about it.

   Our Lord here says to the apostles, that the world hated Him, and would
   hate them; and also, that they were not of the world, because He had
   chosen and taken them out of it.

   Now to this it is sometimes said, that our Lord spoke of the
   unenlightened world before and at His coming, of the world by which He
   was rejected and crucified; that since He overcame sin and death, and
   cast out the prince of this world, it has been won to Himself; that now
   it is the Christian world. And again, that these words are spoken to
   the apostles, not to us; to those who had to encounter the world while
   unconverted, and by their words and sufferings to turn it to God: that
   they were indeed taken out of it, all unchanged as it was then; but
   that when the world became Christian, our place was no longer out of
   it, but in it; and it was no longer opposed to Christ and His servants,
   but united to them; so that it is fanaticism, or spiritual pride, or a
   blind and shallow view, to speak of the world we see in the words
   spoken by our Lord of the world then; and that it savours of some great
   personal faults, if we set ourselves in opposition to it, and bring
   ourselves under its censure and dislike. It is said with much force,
   that the ages of polytheism and idolatry, of atheistical philosophy and
   sophistical schools, of impure and turbulent rites, lascivious and
   bloody spectacles in the theatres and the circus; of public tyranny,
   open political corruption, and all that complex spirit of lordly and
   daring enmity against God, which reigned in and through these things,
   has been cast out of Christendom; that it has been exorcised, and the
   unclean presence is gone out of it; that it now sits at Christ's feet
   clothed and in its right mind. We are bid to look at the visible Church
   throughout the world; at the holiness of saints, the devotion of
   princes, the purity of tribunals, the wisdom of legislatures, the
   multiplication of Christian states, the stedfast order of nations,
   their internal peace, the safety of the weak, the consolations of the
   poor, the reign of right and truth in all dealings of men, the sanctity
   of homes, and the high perfection of private life; the public honour of
   religion, the crowds that fill the churches and kneel at the altars of
   Christ. Can it be said that all this is the antagonist of Christ; that
   this is the world that hates Him, and out of which He has chosen you?
   Is not this to speak evil of His own work, and to set yourselves
   against Him in it? to slight His presence in turning from it, and to
   commit a kind of schism in separating from it? No one can deny that
   there is much force in this; and many people who desire to walk in the
   way of perfection are perplexed by it: for after all, it seems strange
   and unlikely to them that the world which they renounced in their
   baptism should be the world at Christ's coming--the world before
   Constantine--a thing of history. It was a safe vow, which we could
   never be tempted to break, and no hard thing to renounce that by which
   we could never be assailed. But this will not satisfy any earnest
   conscience. We must find, therefore, some better and fuller view; and
   for this purpose we shall do best to begin at the beginning of this
   entangled subject.

   In its original sense, the world is altogether good. By the work and
   will of God it is all sinless and pure. "The earth and the world is the
   Lord's." [132] It means no more than the creation of God. It is only in
   its second intention that the world has an evil sense; but that sense
   is its prevailing and its true one. The first intention of it is
   cancelled for awhile, until the day of the restitution of all things.

   In the second sense the world is the creation of God as it is possessed
   by sin and death. So subtil and far-spreading is the original sin of
   man, that no living soul is without a taint. The living powers of the
   first man fell under the bias of evil, and the same has more or less
   swayed every one since born into the world. There is no doubt that sin
   be comes more complex and energetic as time goes on,--that there is in
   the character of the world a law of deterioration, like that which we
   see in the character of individuals. The original sin was not a
   measured quantity, so to speak, of evil, which, like a hereditary
   disease, might exhaust itself in the course of two or three descents.
   Every several generation renewed it afresh; every several man
   reproduced it, and sustained the tradition of evil by example, habit,
   and license; it was perpetuated in races, in nations, in families; by
   custom, usage, and law. And what is this great tradition of human
   thought and will, action and imagination, with all its illusions,
   misjudgments, indulgences, and abuses of God's creatures, but the
   world? We mean by it something external to our minds, and yet not
   identical with the creation of God; some thing which has thrust itself
   between it and us; something parasitical, which has fastened upon all
   God's works, and has wound itself into its inmost action, and into its
   very being. For instance, Enoch, as we are told, was born into an
   idolatrous race: he found himself surrounded by a mighty delusion,
   which had grown up out of no one mind, or people, or age; it was the
   accumulated error of centuries, in which man had been forgetting God.
   And this great lie offered itself to him as a truth and a reality. It
   forced itself upon him with all the presumption of an established and
   long-admitted doctrine.

   So, again, in the case of Abraham, until God called him out from his
   kindred, who "served other gods beyond the flood;" and so, likewise,
   with those born in the times of the Judges, and in the times of the
   last kings of Judah, when the abominations of the Gentiles had filled
   the inmost chambers of Jerusalem. In all these there was a system of
   belief and practice, which spread corruption throughout the public and
   private life of the Jews; and that system was the worship and the
   kingdom of the God of this world, the great heathen tradition of
   mankind which had re-entered the precincts of Israel. And what makes
   this the more striking is, that they were specially God's elect.
   Abraham was chosen out of this world, and his children in him.
   Separation from the world was the very law of their existence as God's
   people. The world was, in all truth, external to the family of Abraham.
   In one sense it may be said that they "were not of the world," and that
   God had chosen them "out of the world." And this continued to be true
   of them to the very last, through their captivity, and their
   restoration, down to the time of Christ's coming. They were strictly an
   elect people; and around them lay the world, out of which they were
   taken and set apart.

   And yet it was specially out of this very people that our Lord chose
   His apostles. It was of that very people that He said, "If the world
   hate you, ye know it hated Me before it hated you." This was not said
   of Moabites or Idumaeans, but of Israelites. All elect and separate as
   they were, they were the world still; and they hated Christ, and
   crucified the Lord of glory. And it was of this election of His
   apostles from among God's people Israel that He said, "If ye were of
   the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the
   world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world
   hateth you." Now, what does this mean, but that the world was in the
   very heart of Jerusalem--in its Priests, in its Levites, in its
   Scribes, in its Elders, in Sadducees, Pharisees, Herodians; in its
   ecclesiastical order, in its civil state, in its gates, at its altars,
   in the midst of the temple, in its rulers houses, in its feasts and
   fasts, in the council and in the sanhedrim, in all houses, in all
   chambers, in all hearts: that the great world-wide tradition of lust,
   pride, unbelief, selfishness, will-worship, prejudice, blindness, with
   all its vanities, pomps, glitter, and lies, was spread like a net over
   the whole face of the land? They had been born, as Abraham and Enoch,
   into the midst of an age at enmity with God, The world had interwoven
   itself with the whole framework of national and individual life; and
   between the presence of God and the conscience of man had hung a film,
   ever-shifting and many-coloured, which tinged and distorted all things.
   The great tradition of the fall weighed upon the whole order of life in
   Galilee and Judea. The revelation of God was darkened by the grossness
   of their spiritual state. The work of grace which God had wrought by
   prophets and seers, and all the forerunning tokens and types, which
   should have prepared them for the Son of God, for His sorrows, and for
   His spiritual kingdom, were all misread by their eyes of flesh. When
   they read Moses and the prophets, the world was their expositor. As
   they lusted, so they believed. Therefore they eat and drank, planted
   and builded, married and gave in marriage, disputed in their
   synagogues, went to law with the poor, devoured the houses of widows
   and the bread of orphans, prayed in public, fasted visibly, gave alms
   with observation. This was the world out of which Christ elected His
   apostles,--the state of fleshly indulgence, dull infidelity, confident
   profession, fatal non-expectation of the day of His coming.

   He first broke up the way through, this bond age of death, and called
   them to follow Him forth into the realities of God's kingdom. All that
   they were born into they shook from them, and stood afar off, as from a
   thing under a curse.

   The world, then, out of which they were taken, was not the Gentile
   world, but the disobedience of the visible Church.

   We have here a clue which will lead us safely out of this question.

   1. First, it is true to distinguish between the Church and the world,
   as between things antagonist and irreconcilable: for the Son of God, by
   His incarnation and atonement, and by the calling and mission of His
   apostles, has founded and built up in the earth a visible kingdom,
   which has no other Head but Him alone. That visible kingdom is so taken
   out of the world, that a man must either be in it or out of it; and
   must, therefore, be either in the Church or in the world. In the
   visible kingdom of Christ are all the graces and promises of life; in
   the world are the powers and traditions of death. We know of no
   revealed salvation out of that visible kingdom; we can point to no
   other way to life. There is but one Saviour, one Mediator, one
   Sacrifice for the sin of the world; one baptism for the remission of
   sins; one rule of faith; one law of holiness. "We are of God," writes
   St. John, "and the whole world lieth in wickedness." [133] "I have
   manifested Thy name," saith our Lord, "unto the men which Thou gavest
   Me out of the world: Thine they were, and Thou gavest them Me; and they
   have kept Thy word. . . . I pray for them: I pray not for the world,
   hut for them which Thou hast given Me; for they are Thine. . . . . I
   have given them Thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they
   are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. I pray not that
   Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep
   them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the
   world." [134] He made His Church so separate and visibly distinct from
   the world, that it became a broad and enduring witness of His advent,
   and of His divine mission to mankind. "Neither pray I for these alone,
   but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word;" that
   is, for the catholic Church to the world's end: "that they all may be
   one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be
   one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me." It is
   needless to multiply quotations in a thing so plain. It is certain
   that, in a very true, deep, and ineffaceable sense, the Church is so
   taken out of the world as to be absolutely separate from it, and
   opposed to it. It is so by the gifts of election and regeneration; by
   the graces of righteousness, illumination, and sanctity; by the laws,
   precepts, counsels of obedience; by the traditions, sacraments, and
   institutions of God. And this is a separation and distinctness not
   simply external or relative, as of things ceremonially consecrated;
   though even so, it would be no less actual; but it is parted from the
   world as a leavened mass from a mass unleavened--as a field in which
   seed has been sown, from a field lying fallow; that is, by the unseen
   presence of Christ, the inward endowments and virtual possession of
   righteousness and of immortal life. It is, therefore, no less than a
   covert denial of the great mystery of the regeneration, to confound
   this separation and opposition between the Church and, the world; and
   it has been commonly found, that wheresoever faith in the sovereign
   grace of God to us in our baptism has declined, there the distinction
   between the Church and the world has been confounded, and finally lost.
   In this sense, then, they that are of the world are not of the Church,
   and they that are of the Church are not of the world. There can be no
   real fellowship or intercourse between those that are of the body of
   Christ and those that are not. The only intercourse the Church has ever
   held with the heathen has been either such as St. Paul permitted to the
   Christians in Corinth, who might still maintain the relations of
   outward kindliness with unbelievers, or direct missions for the
   conversion of nations to the faith. There could be no closer
   fellowship; for as the world had its own complex scheme of political,
   social, and personal life, so had the Church, over and above its
   positive institutions, a whole moral character, founded on precepts and
   counsels both of obedience and devotion altogether separate and
   distinct. The communion of saints could no way blend with the
   fellowship of the impure. It had no unity with the violent, covetous,
   and unholy, or of those who believed in nothing unseen. The personal
   habits of the Christian, aiming at the example of the Son of God, could
   in no way adjust themselves to the habits of the heathen. And this St.
   Paul intends in his counsels about the marriage of Christians. There
   was a moral and formal contrariety between the rules of conduct and aim
   on both sides, which held the Church and the world apart.

   2. But farther, it is no less true to say, that the world, which in the
   beginning was visibly without the Church, is now invisibly within it.
   So long as the world was heathen, it warred against the Church in
   bitter and relentless persecutions. The two great traditions--the one
   of God, the other of the world, the powers of the regeneration and of
   the fall--kept their own integrity by contradiction and perpetual
   conflict. The Church stood alone--a kingdom ordained of God, having her
   own princes and thrones, her own judges and tribunals, her own laws and
   equity, her own public customs and private economy of life. All these
   ran clear from a source freshly opened, and in a channel newly sunk to
   preserve their purity. The streams of the world had not as yet fallen
   into the river of God: its waters were transparent still. It was when
   the conversion of individuals drew after it, at last, the whole civil
   state; when the secular powers, with all their courts, pomps,
   institutions, laws, judicatures, and the entire political order of the
   world, came into the precinct of the Church; then it was that the great
   tradition, as I have said, of human thought, passion, belief,
   prejudice, and custom, mingled itself with the unwritten usages of the
   Church. I am far from saying this with the intention of those who
   declaim against those ages, and sit in judgment on the Church. All this
   seems to imply a shortsighted and irrelevant habit of mind. Without
   doubt it was as much the design of God that the Church should possess
   itself of the empire of the world, as that Israel should possess itself
   of a fixed habitation in the land of Canaan, and that David's throne
   should be set up in Jerusalem. The typical or temporal import of this
   is no objection. It was the design of Heaven that the Church should
   overspread mankind, and, like the leaven, work mysteriously in the
   whole world. Neither is it any objection to say, that the Church has
   thereby lost in purity or devotion, and the like. It is enough that it
   is doing God's behests, grappling with the world in its own precincts,
   and in its seats of power and pride. Whatever be the apparent tide of
   the struggle, we are sure of this, that the work of God is being
   wrought by the Church upon the world. When the world seems to prevail,
   yet even then the elect are being made perfect. And it is equally
   certain, that the probation of our faith is all the more keen and
   searching. When Noah was shut into the ark, his faith had a strong
   trial to endure; but he was shielded from manifold temptations. It was
   after he had again possessed the earth that he was tempted and fell.
   [135] In the beginning the Church had a sorer and a more fiery trial:
   but who can say that the peril of souls is not greater now? In those
   days it was no hard matter to discern between the world and the Church.
   But now our very difficulty is, to know what is that world which we
   have renounced; to detect its snares, and to overcome its allurements.
   It is no longer an external adversary, raging, reviling, and wearing
   out the name of Christ. Now it is within. The world is inside the fold,
   baptised, catechised, subdued, specious, and worshipping. This is a far
   more dangerous antagonist.

   According to the sure promise of Christ, and by the power of His
   presence, the Church has in a wonderful manner preserved inviolate the
   whole tradition of the Faith. All that He taught and commanded for the
   perfection of His elect has been kept spotless in the midst of this
   evil world. But no one can read the history of Christendom without
   discerning the same law of decline and deterioration, which has from
   the beginning obtained among mankind, prevailing, not over the Church
   as it is a work of the Divine presence, but over the moral,
   intellectual, social condition of nations professing Christianity. It
   would be out of place here to give detailed examples; but I may just
   refer to the corruption of Christian Africa in the time of St.
   Augustin, and of Eng land under the later Saxon kings, and of the north
   of Italy in the sixteenth century. It is most certain that there is a
   power always working in Christian nations, which is not of God, nor of
   the Church, but of the world, of that corruption which every generation
   reproduces, and of that aboriginal evil which has been always working
   in our fallen race, unfolding itself in endless forms, and perpetuating
   its effects by a most subtil transmission from age to age. To be more
   particular: I will say, that the state of public morals, the habits of
   personal and social life, popular amusements, and the policy of
   governments, so far as they are not under the direct guidance of
   religion, are examples of the presence and power of that which is
   properly and truly called the world. And nobody need fear to add, that
   the tone and moral effect of all these, except when they are especially
   guided by religion to a Christian use and purpose, is almost always, in
   a greater or less degree, at variance with God. The laws of every
   Christian state, the customs of every Christian society, and the
   practice of families and individuals as contained in them, are, indeed,
   always professedly based upon the laws of God, and limited by the
   precepts of Christ. It is not, however, the outline but the filling in
   that determines the character: it is not the letter, but the
   interpretation that fixes the meaning, and gives emphasis to the sense:
   so it is with the complex social state of a Christian people. The laws
   of Christian faith are all there, but so glossed and paraphrased, so
   interlined by commentaries and lowered by adjustments, that it is no
   longer the Church warring its way through the world, but the world
   playing the Christian in a masque. This, then, is the world which in
   our baptism we renounced. It was no remote or imaginarynotion, but a
   present and active reality: that very same principle of original evil
   which, in all ages, under all shapes, in all places, has issued in
   lust, pride, covetousness, vainglory. It surrounds us in the visible
   Church now as it surrounded the apostles in the Holy City of old. It
   cleaves to all things about us. It is in all places of concourse, in
   all business, in all pleasures, in all assemblies and spectacles, in
   all homes, in all the circumstances of our personal life. We are not
   called to separate ourselves from any outward system, as they were, but
   to be inwardly as estranged from the evil that cleaves to the system
   around us, as if we were not of it. "I pray not that Thou shouldest
   take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the
   evil." Let us, then, lay deeply to heart this great truth, that our
   only safety is in being inwardly dead to the love and fear of the
   world. Let us go boldly to all lawful work, even though it be in the
   midst of it; for in that God will keep us pure. However secular our
   toil may be, whether in trading, or tilling the ground, or in the
   administration of law, or in the government and service of Christian
   states, in all these, when God leads us, He will be our shield, and we
   shall be kept spotless. Only let us watch against craving, or lusting,
   or hungering after the honours, gifts, and gains of life. The desire of
   these things, though we be never corrupted by attaining them, will turn
   all our work to snares, and make our very duties to be perilous. He
   that loves these things is to be bought, and has his price, and all men
   know it; and even the world despises while it buys him for its own. Let
   us be on our guard against that basest of all idolatry, the worship of
   wealth, or rank, or numbers; and against that most hateful of all
   intoxication, the love of popular applause, and the admiration of men
   that shall die. The favour of the world is no sign of the saints. The
   cross is their portion. The voice of the many is no test of truth, nor
   warrant of right, nor rule of duty. Truth and right, and a pure
   conscience, have been ever with the few. "Many are called, but few are
   chosen." So it ever has been and shall be. Let us, therefore, pray God
   for strength to do our work in the world without fear, but to find our
   rest in Him. Let us not think ourselves safe in a fancied separation
   from society around us: we cannot escape it any more than the light of
   day. Nevertheless, let us at least stand aloof from it all we may. Work
   in the world we needs must; but we need not to feast and revel, to
   accept its gifts, nor go wondering after its greatness. Let us not take
   li cense to taste or to possess all its lawful things, for " all things
   are not expedient," "all things edify not." The world has too much
   craft to thrust upon us at first the offer of forbidden things. Soft
   things and fair, things harmless and with out blame, come first and
   smooth the way for more subtil allurements. There is but one safe guard
   for Christ's servants; to be like Him in whom the prince of this world
   in the hour of temptation had nothing he could make his own. Our safety
   is not so much where as what we are.

SERMON XIV.

  ON MIXING IN THE WORLD, AND ITS SAFEGUARDS.

    ST. MATT. xi. 18, 19.

   "John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.
   The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man
   gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners."

   THERE is a remarkable contrast between the examples of St. John Baptist
   and of our Lord. St. Luke tells us of St. John, that "the child grew,
   and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his
   shewing unto Israel:" but of our Lord he says, that He went down "to
   Nazareth, and was subject" to the Blessed Virgin and Joseph, and that
   He "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man."
   [136] There was a difference in them even from childhood. John lived
   apart from men, a severe, ascetic life, in hard ship and solitude.
   Jesus dwelt in a house, among the habitations, trades, and cares of
   men: for thirty years His was a life such as ours, in all outward
   things unnoticed and commonplace. And so they both grew up; and in full
   manhood they came forth, the one a preacher of repentance in the
   wilderness, having "his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle
   about his loins, and his meat was locusts and wild honey." [137] The
   other a preacher of repentance in the world, sitting at meat in the
   houses of Pharisees and Scribes, and at the table of Levi and Zaccheus
   the publicans; going, when bidden, even to marriage-feasts, mixing in
   life, and seeming to partake of the habits and courtesies of men. In a
   word, John lived out of the world, and our Lord lived in it. And that
   is the truth which His enemies distorted against Him. "John came
   neither eating nor drinking:" he was severe, mortified, unbending,
   isolated; and they cast him out as a demoniac, saying, "He hath a
   devil." "The Son of man came eating and drinking:" pitiful, tender,
   compassionate, stooping to the weakness and burdens of common life; and
   they reviled Him as lax, self-indulgent, and dissolute, "a man
   gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans," and a partaker in
   the revelling of sinners.

   Now, of the many subjects naturally arising out of these words, there
   is one to which we shall do well to confine our attention: I mean, the
   lawfulness of intercourse with the world, and the limitations within
   which it should be restrained. This is a very difficult question in
   practice, and often involves painful doubts and misgivings. We hear it
   much talked of, and by some in a very confident and sweeping way;
   which, however, for the most part, turns out to be only words after
   all. Nevertheless, there is a grave matter of Christian duty here at
   stake; and it is of great moment that we should come both to some clear
   understanding of it, and to some fixed and tenable principles on which
   to determine our own conduct. It is not to be denied, that our Lord's
   example, as contrasted with that of St. John, does warrant, as a
   general principle, our entering into the world. But there are some
   points to be considered which will reduce the apparent breadth of that
   warrant to a much narrower measure.

   We must remember, then, first of all, why He did so. It was not for His
   own sake, or for any of those motives and inducements which it would be
   an irreverence even to speak of. He went for the sake of others; He was
   "come to seek and to save that which was lost:" [138] as He told
   Zaccheus, giving the reason of His making Himself his guest. That day
   salvation was come to the publican's house. [139] For the same cause,
   He laid Himself open to the reproach, "This man receiveth sinners, and
   eateth with them;" and suffered also the woman which was a sinner to
   wash his feet with her tears. It was, therefore, plainly in the
   discharge of His ministry of salvation that He mixed at large among all
   men. The world was the field of His toil; it was the wilderness where
   His lost sheep were scattered abroad, and He therefore went out into
   the world to seek them.

   And we must not forget Who He was that so adventured Himself: it was He
   who had overcome the tempter in the wilderness; the same in whom, when
   the prince of this world came to Him, he had no share nor title. It was
   safe for Him who was without sin to pass to and fro through all perils
   of contamination. He could no more be sullied than the light of day.
   Perhaps it was for this reason that, while prophets and seers, even to
   John, the greatest of all, had lived apart in watchfulness and
   mortification, our blessed Lord mixed among men, entered their homes,
   sat at their tables, and partook of their common habits, their food,
   and feasts, and social life.

   These two considerations, however, while they remind us that both His
   work and His spotless sanctity made laws for Him which are not
   necessarily laws for us, do not take away the force of His conduct as a
   general rule to guide us in the same subject. After separating all
   differences, His is still our example. Let us see, therefore, how far
   it will warrant us.

   1. First of all, then, it will not only clearly warrant, but actually
   enjoin upon us to mix in the world, so far as the calling or work of
   our life requires. And this must be determined for each one of us by a
   multitude of details; such as, our condition by birth, education,
   fortune, profession, outward relations of kindred, neighbourhood,
   charity, and the like. Every body has his place in the world, and that
   place has its duties, charges, and character. We must be in a great
   measure guided by these. For instance, high birth, or the possession of
   great wealth, forces people into a sphere of life which has a multitude
   of very extensive relations. It is their duty to fulfil the obligations
   thereby laid on them. Princes must be surrounded by their courts;
   high-born and wealthy men keep large houses, and have many guests and
   numerous entertainments. There need be no worldliness in all this. It
   may be, indeed, little better than worldly ostentation; and it may feed
   and kindle all manner of worldly lusts: but it need not do so. Like all
   things, it is capable of perversion; but in itself it is only the
   natural sphere of the princes and great men of this world. It is,
   however, a very different matter, when men of humbler birth and less
   fortunes either strive to gain entrance to the ranks of those that are
   above them, or strain to be their equals. There is a proportion in all
   the dispensations of Providence: every man has his own range and limit,
   within which he is safe; and all things may be lawful and sanctified by
   the word of God and prayer. The administration of property, and the
   management of estates, necessarily mixes men up with the world. So,
   much more, do professions and employments: statesmen, lawyers,
   soldiers, physicians, merchants, tradesmen of every sort, are compelled
   to meet and deliberate, to barter and consult, to act in common, to
   combine for worldly objects, without knowledge of each other's
   character--often with the full knowledge of facts which make them
   desirous of having no more intercourse with each other than they can
   help. Now it is obvious that all this is lawful and necessary; that it
   is even inevitable; that, as St. Paul says, to escape it, "we must
   needs go out of the world." [140] We may be compelled to meet very bad
   men, and infidels, and even heathens, and to transact with them such
   things as "maintain the state of the world." And all this is plainly
   not only allowed, but imposed on us by the providence of God, which has
   determined the conditions on which all these things depend; such as our
   birth, station, fortune, calling, relations in life. In so mixing in
   the world, we are carrying out the work which is set us to do; just as
   our blessed Lord, for the fulfilment of His work, went wheresoever it
   could be done.

   What has been said of those whose duties are simply of a secular kind
   applies even more strongly to those who bear sacred offices. They are
   bound, in faithfulness to their commission, to mix even among the worst
   of men; not, indeed, as companions, but as instructors, reprovers, and
   guides.

   There are, however, multitudes with whom the pastors of the Church are
   compelled to mix in an ordinary way, and to watch their opportunities
   of usefulness. To them the example of our Lord is a direct precedent.
   The courtesies and kindly offices of life they are under a sort of
   necessity to accept, that they may share the joys and sorrows of other
   men, and by their sympathy gain a hearing when they speak in their
   Master's name.

   Thus far, then, is clear: It is not so much in the point of necessary
   work as in the matter of unnecessary society with the world, that the
   difficulty arises. And yet it will be found, that the limit of our
   common intercourse with people is very much regulated by the facts of
   our providential lot. Our Lord has sanctioned a marriage-feast by His
   own presence; and that will shew that feasting is not unlawful in
   itself. There is a "gladness and singleness of heart" [141] in eating
   our bread, which is a duty. Sadness and sullenness are not the gifts of
   the Spirit; but thankful tempers, cheerful giving, mutual joy, music
   and dancing and the fatted calf: these things belong to the new
   creation, in which once more "every creature of God is good." Therefore
   we may fairly say, that such seasonable and measured participation of
   God's good gifts, and of the enjoyments naturally arising out of the
   relations which kindred, or neighbourhood, or friendship involves, is
   lawful and good, and capable of the Divine presence and benediction.
   But this nobody disputes--nobody, that is, whose disputation it is
   profitable to hear. The true difficulty lies in so limiting these
   things in their extent, and so chastening their character, as to
   preserve them from being turned into occasions of temptation, and into
   hindrances to the spiritual life.

   2. Our Lord's example, then, suggests to us, farther, that we ought to
   measure our intercourse with the world by what is safe for ourselves.
   It is perfectly certain, that the attraction and operation of the world
   upon the mind of most persons is highly injurious. It first hinders the
   work of their sanctification, and next changes their tone of mind into
   its own temper and spirit. This is what St. Paul means when he warns
   the Romans, "Be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by
   the renewing of your mind." [142]

   Here is the peculiar danger. All things about us are charged with some
   measure of the world's evil and power. No lines can be drawn round the
   infected quarters. They have neither beginning nor ending; no limit or
   boundary. The whole visible Church is affected by it; whole nations,
   states, and households. The evil is continuous, all-pervading,
   ubiquitous. If we would escape the world, we must needs go out of the
   world: nothing less than this will do it. And this shews the
   impossibility of that which some excellent persons, with the best
   intentions, have endeavoured to do: I mean, to draw peremptory lines
   between their households and "the world." They might as well draw a
   line between themselves and the race of mankind; for, draw it where
   they will, they do but make a distinction without a difference; and
   moreover, they shut out of their precinct some of the holiest saints,
   and shut into it some who are the very worshippers of the world. And
   the ill effects of this mistake are manifold. It savours much of rash
   judgment, self-preference, and separation; and it fosters a dangerous
   spirit of security, making people think that within their circle they
   are safe, and that this safety consists in outward lines of separation,
   in stead of an inward grace of watchfulness and purity of heart. It is
   remarkable how, in families which have isolated themselves from the
   healthy unconscious action of open intercourse with others, evils of
   the strangest and most unlocked for kind have unfolded themselves. It
   is with the spiritual as it is with the natural life; a false principle
   of sustenance or of action, once admitted, works out the most
   unwholesome and morbid effects. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why
   the children of persons of much real piety have not seldom turned out
   sinful or unsatisfactory. They have been brought up in a state of
   artificial separation from the world, without the real discipline of
   the in ward character, which nothing but probation, or a truly devout
   life, seems to bestow.

   Now from all this it is evident, that the danger of mixing with the
   world is very great; and that we have need, not only to be afraid of
   the positive evils spread throughout the common intercourse of life,
   and especially in relaxations, feasts, entertainments, with their
   exciting and ensnaring pleasures; but also to be afraid of ourselves.
   The more unlike we are to our Lord, the less safe is it for us to
   venture abroad; the more conscious we are that we are vividly
   susceptible of temptations, easily elated, or blinded, or led away, and
   that nothing but a strong inward principle of self-mortification can
   preserve us, the more we are bound to withdraw ourselves from the
   world, as from a scene of temptation, and a source of peculiar danger.
   Now it is certain that we shall be safe from the ill effect of the
   world just in the measure in which we are unwilling to mix in it; and
   that as we incline to it, the more susceptible we are of its contagion.
   If we do not believe it to be tempting and dangerous, we shall be sure
   to fall; if we do not go into it with shrinking and reluctance, we are
   certainly in peril. Thus much is evident already, that the god of this
   world has gone far to blind our minds to the reality of his presence
   and his wiles; that we must be in a state of no little hardihood,
   self-reliance, or insensibility. And in such a temper, all intercourse
   with the world must be perilous. This is universally true, whether our
   contact with the world be for business or for pleasure; whether we be
   laymen or clergymen; whether it be public or private intercourse.
   Things in themselves lawful and safe become inevitable temptations to
   men who do not know their liability to be tempted in that particular
   form. The motives on which we go into the world, and the aims we set
   before as, will be no sufficient security. Statesmen who have thrown
   themselves, in pure patriotism, into the struggle of public life, often
   end in faction and partisan ship. Even men in holy orders, who give
   themselves to a just and seasonable line of public action for the
   service of the Church, not seldom end in ambition and secularity; and
   others, who go into private society on the theory of promoting their
   influence for good, often grow careless and indevout, and adopt, as a
   settled habit, the very tone to which they yielded for a time with a
   view to raising it. And if these things happen to guides of souls, in
   the path of supposed or of real duty, what may we not fear for those
   who mix in the world only for pleasure? Can any thing be more frivolous
   and impertinent than the conversation which even wiser men sometimes
   endure to hear and to partake of? If they would but confess the truth,
   would they not acknowledge that the greater part of their worldly
   visiting and mutual entertainment leaves them farther from God than
   they were when they entered upon it? Can they not trace the effect of
   the world on all their private devotions? Do they not find themselves
   troubled in their prayers by a multitude of thoughts? Is not the
   temptation to distraction and weariness in prayer greatly increased?

   And what does all this prove, but that such intercourse is not safe for
   them; that they are being "conformed to this world;" that the truth of
   their character to its own convictions and to itself is being frittered
   away; that they more readily catch the tone of those they live with,
   and adopt their system of judging and speaking, instead of impressing
   their own convictions on others, or even preserving their own
   consistency? To take one instance, of which this naturally reminds us:
   how unspeakably difficult is the government of the tongue; and how
   awful a fact it is to reflect upon, that every word we speak is an
   expression of the posture or inclination of the undying spirit that is
   in us; that every such inclination of the spirit God weighs in a
   balance; and that we are swayed by a thousand daily temptations to
   speak at random, or in haste, or in excessive terms, outrunning the
   truth of our hearts; and that "every idle word that men shall speak,
   they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment." [143] There is
   no stimulus to the tongue so great as intercourse with the world: men
   must talk, that they may not seem morose, foolish, contemptuous, or
   self-important. And yet what are the laws and conditions on which the
   world will allow a man to talk, but that he will adopt its own phrases,
   views, maxims, and freedom of speech? For those who would mix in the
   world with safety there is needed just the reverse of the very gifts
   which make men the world's favourites: namely, gifts of caution,
   retirement, and silence. In fact, they mix in it with least peril who
   are distinguished either for wanting or for concealing the facilities
   and endowments which the world most covets and cherishes. One principal
   rule by which to mea sure what is safe for us is, a thorough knowledge
   of our own infirmities--of the frailties of our character. And this,
   after all, is the true criterion of what is expedient for us. I say
   this, because it seems impossible to enter now into the particulars of
   this or that form of worldly amusement. For the most part, the
   entertainments and usages of the world shade off into each other with
   such graduated tints, that it is not possible in many cases to draw a
   line. Some things, indeed, are in their tone and effects, in the system
   by which they are supported, and in the consequences they produce, so
   plainly and undisguisedly dangerous, that there can be no hesitation in
   naming them. For instance, the whole system of theatres is such, that I
   do not see how any one can go to them with safety. No special pleading
   about their great moral lessons, and elevated heroic or national
   character, and the like, will avail to save them from a simple and
   direct condemnation, as one of the most subtil, complex, and
   wide-spreading snares of the world. Having said this, it is perhaps
   best to add no more than, that occasions and acts of public concourse,
   in which the reserve of private life is relaxed, are dangerous to the
   simplicity and purity of the mind; and that the entertainments and
   feastings of private life, where luxury, indiscriminate acquaintance,
   display of personal appearance or gifts, are admitted, are both
   dangerous and hurtful.

   Thus much has been said by way of general principles and suggestions.
   All that can be done farther is, to give some particular precepts,
   which will serve as safeguards to counteract the influence of the
   world, where it cannot be avoided. When it can be, the wisest and
   happiest course for those that desire, in purity of heart, to see God,
   is, to withdraw themselves altogether from paths which need the force
   of so many precepts to make them at best only comparatively safe.

   1 . The first rule, then, to be laid down is this: that we take no
   lower standard of life than the example of our blessed Lord. Nothing
   but this will set before our conscience a clear definite view of the
   true end of our Christian profession, which is plainly nothing less
   than to be made like, in life and spirit, to the holiness of our Lord
   Jesus Christ. At our regeneration we received a gift of the Holy Ghost,
   the grace of a heavenly nature; we were made inwardly capable of
   attaining to the sinless perfection of our Master. Not, indeed, in this
   life; but the dispositions, affections, inclinations of soul, which
   shall issue hereafter in that perfection, must be trained and nurtured
   in us throughout the whole course of this earthly life. When shall we
   bear in mind this plain truth, that the future perfection of the saints
   is not a translation from one state or disposition of soul into
   another, diverse from the former; but the carrying out, and as it were
   the blossom and the fruitage of one and the same principle of spiritual
   life, which, through their whole career on earth, has been growing with
   an even strength, putting itself forth in the beginnings and promise of
   perfection, reaching upward with stedfast aspirations after perfect
   holiness? If we forget this, we shall understand nothing,--our whole
   life will be a confusion, our whole probation a perplexity; we shall be
   imposed on by false judgments, unsound examples, misleading principles
   of action. We shall think that the sum of religion is, what is called,
   to do our duty in the world--that is, to be outwardly blameless
   according to the letter of the second table of the law; to be honest
   traders, industrious students, hard-working labourers, kind parents,
   good-hearted friends. Truth, a forgiving disposition, benevolence,
   general good-will, a kind temper, a moderate and occasional indulgence
   in worldly amusements, a decent attendance on religious worship, and
   regularity in house hold morals and habits, make up the Christianity of
   most people. And so far as it goes, nothing may be said against it. But
   tried by the life and mind of Christ, by the realities of holiness and
   of fellowship with God, by the humiliation and mystery of the cross,
   which are "the marks of the Lord Jesus," how defective, dim-sighted,
   unenergetic, and relaxed it must appear! The fact is, that the great
   multitude of those who live in the world have little perception of the
   intense and searching spirituality of the life of Christ, which their
   regeneration binds them to imitate. And therefore the life of most is
   as vague, pointless, and unmeaning as the reasoning of men who do not
   know what it is they are going to prove. By this we may chiefly account
   for the infinite variety of imperfect characters, which have something
   of true Christianity about them, but are marred, stunted, and
   contracted. Of course, want of energy and perseverance will produce
   many of the same results; but in a majority of cases, really
   well-disposed people go through life with a low, cold, heartless notion
   of our Lord's example. They can see the exterior perfection of His
   life, as measured by the second table of the law; but the motives even
   of that perfection, much more the whole interior life which is related
   to the love and worship of God, they simply cannot perceive. It is too
   high, inward, and deep, for their spiritual senses, which are
   "exercised" to discern the broader and more sensible features of
   Christian duty, but cannot distinguish the characters and outlines of
   God's kingdom as it is impressed upon the affections, thoughts, and
   motions of our spiritual being. How, then, is it to be wondered at, if
   they see no inconsistency between habits of free intercourse with
   society and a life of religion? There is, indeed, no inconsistency with
   a life of their religion. It has nothing which is at variance with
   self-indulgence, and a relaxed tone of conversation. Days spent in
   visiting, and evenings in amusements, leave no effects which are
   traceable in their morning and evening prayers; because those prayers
   have been long said with just so much of fervour and attention as is
   compatible with their habitual way of living: they are therefore no
   index. They would judge very differently, if they could once rightly
   perceive the purity, gentleness, meekness, deadness to the world,
   denial of self, subjugation of will, vivid zeal for the salvation of
   the elect and for the glory of God, which were in our blessed Lord. If
   they could understand, for instance, the meaning of one such word as
   "Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of
   heart;" or, "I am not of this world;" they would see all things as if
   the light of the sun had waxed "sevenfold, as the light of seven days."
   All the goings on of life--its eating and drinkings, planting and
   building, its buying and selling, marrying and giving in
   marriage--would be seen as they will be in the day of the Son of man.
   The snares and perils of life and ease, of wealth and pleasure, of
   business and refinement; the perilous entanglements and depressing
   influence even of common life; the false maxims and illusions of
   mankind, and the secret atheism of the world, would all be seen as by
   an intuition of the spirit. They would then see that the spirit of the
   world is the very antagonist of the mind of Christ; that none could
   dwell in it unsullied by its touch but He alone.

   2. And therefore, in the next place, it is plain that we must so shape
   our way through life as shall most foster and promote our continual
   advance in attaining to the perfection of our new birth, which is the
   sanctity of Christ. And what is this but, in other words, to be true to
   the vows of our baptism? We then bound ourselves to "renounce the devil
   and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all
   covetous desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh;" and
   promised that we would "neither follow nor be led by them." It is
   impossible to add strength to this vow; it is unconditional and
   peremptory, and extends over the whole subject of which we are now
   speaking. It is no open question for a Christian, whether he shall
   renounce the world or no: he has renounced it already; he is already
   bound by a perpetual vow; and all that remains is to fulfil it, or to
   forswear himself. Now, there can be no doubt that the majority of
   baptised men fall below the standard of their promise: all do, in deed,
   in respect to its perfection; but I mean, in respect to the measure of
   their ability to fulfil it. Some do it deliberately, some
   unconsciously, some from the power of sin, and some from the weakness
   of their resolutions; but howsoever various the causes, it is certain
   that we may divide the visible body of baptised men into two classes:
   those who do, and those who do not, make the vow of their baptism the
   rule of their life.

   In the first days of the Church, the vow of baptism was made perfect in
   repentance, poverty, charity, in the fellowship of prayers, and holy
   communion; the Church was a fold in the midst of the world, encompassed
   by it, but separate. And yet it retained its inward purity only long
   enough to be a type and prophecy of its perfection in heaven. At
   Philippi, Ephesus, Corinth, and else where, even in St. Paul's day,
   Christians began to fall apart into the two great classes; so that the
   apostle had need to lay down precepts and rules, such as those we are
   now endeavouring to find. To the Corinthians he writes: "I wrote unto
   you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: yet not altogether
   with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or
   extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the
   world. But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man
   that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater,
   or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not
   to eat." [144] And again to the Thessalonians: "Now we command you,
   brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw
   yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after
   the tradition which he received of us." [145] St. Paul here recognises
   a class of men within the Church, or related to it, with whom the
   faithful ought to hold no intercourse; and they are either persons
   excommunicate, or such as, though still suffered to abide in the
   communion of the Church (for instance, the covetous and disorderly),
   are living in breach of their baptismal vow. These and many other
   passages give us the precept of avoiding the contagion of an ill
   example, even among those whom the Church has not put under formal
   censures. The apostle also gives the most detailed counsels for
   purifying our conversation, [146] for edifying one another, [147] for
   sanctifying households; [148] and these give us a farther precept of
   forming our friendships and relations, both with individuals and with
   families, on the principle of promoting the entire conversion of our
   hearts to God. It was, without doubt, from this that persons of a more
   devout temper, and more kindled with the love of the heavenly kingdom,
   drew into closer fellowships within the unity of the Church; whole
   families, perhaps, such as that of Philip the evangelist, who "had four
   daughters which did prophesy;" [149] and "the house of Stephanas," and
   of Chloe and others, gave themselves to a stricter way of life. We may
   take these as examples of what is both possible and right for private
   Christians and households now. There is nothing schismatical in a
   separation which both preserves all religious unity and makes those
   that live apart characteristically humble and charitable. It is most
   certain, that the man who does live by his baptismal vow will find
   himself much alone in his habits, thoughts, and sympathies. The face of
   the visible Church must be very different from what it has been, before
   holiness can fail to bring an apparent separation. So it is with
   families: if any household be consecrated to God by peculiar devotion,
   it will stand out from other families. And yet it dare not do less: the
   vow of its baptism is on it, and it must thereby measure all things. It
   must do and leave undone, possess and give away, seek and renounce,
   enjoy or deny it self, according to this rule. The religion of such a
   house is not only at the foot of the altar, or in its own hours of
   devotion; neither does it take cognisance only of certain portions of
   its daily life; but it is the rule of all its acts, the test of its
   friendships, the measure of its intercourse. And I do not see what any
   Christian household or man can do less than this. They are pledged to
   "work out their salvation with fear and trembling;" to have in them the
   mind that "was in Christ Jesus," in prayer, love, humiliation, and
   habitual fellowship with God. And how this is to be attained without
   abstinence from dangerous and inexpedient things, and from all familiar
   communication with those whose example, spirit, and habit of life,
   oppose or retard the work of our sanctification, it is not easy to
   understand. Where is the reason or consistency in habits of prayer,
   fasting, and self-discipline, if we do not refuse to expose ourselves
   to the levity, inflation, and vanity of the world? Surely all these
   things feed and excite the sins of the heart, and make miserable havoc
   in our habits of simplicity, watchfulness, humility, and recollection.
   We are bound to strengthen and to shelter them against all inroads of
   unholy influence. And moreover: our vow binds us not only to avoid the
   desecrating and deteriorating action of society, but to give ourselves
   up with singleness of aim to the help and guidance of such minds and
   examples, and to such habits and counsels of spiritual wisdom, as shall
   most directly promote the unfolding and perfecting of the life of God
   which is in us.

   And now, before I conclude, I will notice one general objection which
   may be expected to what has been advanced. It will be said, that this
   is a theory; that it is impracticable; that to adopt it men must go
   into the wilderness with St. John Baptist; that they must forsake the
   duties of life, and the interchange of courtesies and kindness, which
   we are bound to maintain.

   In answer to all this, we need do no more than recall the example of
   our blessed Lord. He lived in the world; His work lay in it; He went to
   the houses of publicans--He went without fear, be cause He was perfect.
   It is absolutely necessary to our safety that we should go with fear,
   because we are sinners. Nevertheless, His example will warrant to us
   the lawfulness of mixing in the world as our duties and obligations
   require. What has been said ought to teach us these two things: first,
   to use great and discriminating care in choosing the friends and
   families with whom we mix, and the occasions and festivities in which
   we join. This principle of spiritual discernment, foresight, and
   caution, alone can keep us from serious entanglements, and, it may be,
   from grievous falls. I know of no lines of outward demarcation, nor any
   sufficient catalogue, distinguishing worldly from innocent amusements:
   our safeguard must be in ourselves. And the next thing we should learn
   is, when we can avoid even such intercourse as is lawful, to do so.
   "All things to me are lawful, but all things are not expedient. All
   things to me are lawful, but all things edify not." [150] It is far
   better to bestow the time which we can rescue from the world in things
   that will deepen the work of God in our hearts, and perfect our
   repentance.

   Or if we think well to go, let us go with a heart estranged from the
   fair and smooth things of this perishing world,--from its honours,
   powers, pleasures, and refinements. None ever graced a marriage-feast
   as He who knew not the very taste of earthly happiness. None was ever
   so meek, gentle, and benign as He that was alive to God alone. So let
   us strive to mingle among men--to toil with them, sorrow with them,
   rejoice with them; to visit their homes, and partake of their
   hospitality, and not turn even from their days of festival--praying
   always in secret that we may be sheltered under His last intercession:
   "Holy Father, keep through Thine own name those whom Thou hast given
   Me, that they may be one, as We are;" "they are not of the world, even
   as I am not of the world;" "I pray not that Thou shouldest take them
   out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil."

SERMON XV.

  POVERTY A HOLY STATE.

    2 COR. viii. 9.

   "Ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich,
   yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be
   rich."

   ST. PAUL is here stirring up the Corinthians to give alms to the poor
   saints, by the voluntary poverty of our Lord. He tells them of the
   Macedonians, who, in the spirit of His example, made large offerings
   out of their "deep poverty;" and says that they "first gave their own
   selves to the Lord," and, with themselves, all that they had to His
   service. He then says, "Ye know the grace," the freeness and largeness
   of the charity of Christ, who, "though He was rich," in His eternal
   kingdom, in the bliss of His Father, "yet for your sakes He became
   poor;" stripped Himself of His heavenly state, laid aside His glory,
   "made Himself of no reputation;" was made man, hungered, thirsted; was
   weary, wandered without a place where to lay His head; suffered all
   shame, hard ship, pain, and death; that through this, His poverty of
   all things heavenly and earthly, ye, in the remission of sins, the
   cleansing of the soul, the grace of adoption, and the inheritance of
   the kingdom of heaven, "might be rich."

   Some perhaps might have expected that, at the coming of the Son of God
   into the world, He would have assumed the power and disposal of all
   things by which the world is maintained and governed; that is to say,
   that He would have carried on openly, and by a visible disposal, the
   divine administration of worldly affairs, as He ever does in secret;
   that His providence would have been manifested in His person. Of
   course, no one would expect that He should have affected earthly state
   or greatness: the very thought can hardly be expressed without a sin.
   It seems almost like the suggestion of Satan when he shewed Him all the
   kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them. And yet, we might have
   expected Him to be openly greater than all powers of the earth; to have
   made them acknowledge Him, and yield, as the winds and the waves did,
   to the power of His word. But, on the contrary, no man was ever lower
   in the world than He--more outcast, destitute, weak, and forsaken;
   none, perhaps, ever hungered oftener, or thirsted more, or wandered so
   wearily; was so banished, not from kings palaces, and princes courts,
   and the houses of great men, and the company of the soft, high, rich,
   and noble, but from home and hearth, and from the shelter and charities
   of life. Surely as the world had never seen before an example of such
   perfect holiness, so it had never seen such perfect and willing
   poverty. In the Gospels we read of His passing whole nights on the
   mountain, and in the fourth watch upon the sea. Once we read that He
   went "unto Bethany, and lodged there," [152] in the house of a friend,
   the stranger's home. His life He began and ended as a wanderer, from
   the stable to the sepulchre. So true to the letter were His words,
   "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man
   hath not where to lay His head." Of His own He had little but His
   raiment; even His daily food, they that followed Him "ministered to Him
   of their substance." [153]

   Now this absolute destitution of all things needful for our bodily life
   was, without doubt, a designed feature in His humiliation. When He took
   upon Him our manhood, He took it with all its capacities of suffering;
   and He placed Himself, so to speak, in that position in the life of man
   where all the sorrows which came with sin into the world were surest to
   light upon Him. Weariness, toil, cold, hunger, loneliness, and shame,
   which are the portion of the destitute, He chose as His lot, and tasted
   in their sharpest forms. And He thereby learned to sympathise with the
   universal sufferings of humanity. He became a Saviour, not of any class
   or condition of men, but of all mankind: of man as man in his fallen,
   suffering, sorrowing humanity. It is this that gives to the poor a
   peculiar share in the sympathy of Christ. No man ever was so burdened,
   naked, desolate, but He was more so. His example has consecrated the
   state of poverty, and converted it into a discipline, and bestowed upon
   it a special grace. It is this that we will now consider.

   1. First of all, the poverty of Christ is intended as an example to all
   men. To His earliest followers He gave the precept of poverty; He made
   it binding on them; He made it even the condition of entering His
   service and His kingdom. "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that
   thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
   heaven;" or, as St. Mark records the same command, "One thing thou
   lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor,
   and thou shalt have treasure in heaven." Or again, "Sell that ye have,
   and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in
   the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth
   corrupteth." [154] Peter "said unto Him, Behold, we have forsaken all,
   and followed Thee; what shall we have therefore? And Jesus said unto
   them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed Me, in the
   regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory,
   ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
   Israel. And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
   mother, or sisters, or father, or wife, or children, or lands, for My
   name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit
   everlasting life." [155] "Whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all
   that he hath, he cannot be My disciple." [156] And this precept was
   obeyed to the very letter by His first followers, and by the apostolic
   Church. They sold their houses and lands, and laid the money at the
   apostles' feet. No man "called any thing that he possessed his own;"
   "they had all things common." [157] Now, this community of goods was a
   close imitation of our Lord's example--a prolonging of the fellowship
   which He had with them and they with Him, after His departure. Poverty,
   toil, and a common life, were the daily bonds of their society with
   Him; and they chose to live on as He had left them, still realising His
   presence "who, though He was rich, for our sakes became poor."

   Out of this common life came the fixed endowments of the Church. First,
   the bishop and his clergy, and the poor of Christ, lived of one stock
   and revenue, as it were at one table, at which the spiritual father
   presided in Christ's stead. After wards, when the Church had peace,
   and, in God's good providence, was permitted to make itself fixed homes
   and certain dwelling-places, the necessity which lay on them by reason
   of the then "present distress" ceased; the members of the Church were
   not compelled to give up lands and houses; they had no longer to
   forsake their homes, to go out from all that they possessed; and the
   poor of Christ, the widows and orphans, had a full and certain living,
   "in peaceable habitations, and in quiet resting-places." That which was
   a precept of necessity, became a counsel of perfection. It was a fuller
   and closer imitation of the life of Christ for those who, by the
   providence of God, were permitted to forsake all for the love of their
   heavenly Master. And there have been many, in all ages of the Church,
   who have willingly made themselves poor for Christ's sake, that through
   their poverty and labour of love the elect might be made rich in God's
   kingdom. Some forsook all that they possessed at once, and gave all
   their worldly goods at one offering to the service of the Church, or to
   the poor of Christ, and thenceforward lived by the labour of their
   hands or by the work of the gospel. Others retained their inheritance
   and their right to the goods that they possessed, but converted the
   enjoyment of them into a stewardship. They lived of them; but after
   taking for their own use just so much as their bare need required, they
   gave the rest, by a perpetual and daily oblation, in alms to the poor.
   It may perhaps be said, that the state of the Church at this day, in
   its intermixture with the Christian world, with its political and
   social relations, is such as to make it neither right nor possible for
   most, if for any, to give up all that they possess, and to throw
   themselves into a state of poverty and dependence. Perhaps it may be;
   though the question admits of more discussion than people think; and we
   may refer to it hereafter. For the present it is enough to say, that,
   at all events, the other principle, of holding the wealth of this world
   as a stewardship, as if the title were in God and the inheritance in
   the poor, is altogether possible, and easy to many, if only they have
   charity and devotion to adopt it. I do not say that it is possible for
   all men; far from it: rather that it is, like Holy Orders, a high
   privilege to which a man is called by God Himself. It is plain that
   they who have a household and family depending on them must first
   maintain them with all needful provisions. This is the stewardship of
   most men, to provide for their own, and is a kind of poverty in itself.
   But there are those who either have a larger income than they and their
   families require, or have none at all depending on them. In both these
   cases it is quite possible so to pitch the scale of household and
   personal expenses, as to leave a portion of their yearly income to be
   administered as a stewardship. I do not undertake to say what
   proportion ought to be so devoted. The divine wisdom has prescribed a
   tenth at least. St. Paul has given us a rule which cannot be gainsayed:
   "Having food and raiment, let us be therewith content." And the reason
   on which he grounds it is very awful, from its severe and simple truth:
   "for we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry
   nothing out." The needs of an immortal being are very real, narrow, and
   few. If we would but measure our needs by the measure of a death-bed,
   or the necessities of a holy state, we should look with amazement and
   fear on the excessive and artificial habits of our daily life. Things
   we now look on as necessary would be seen to be wanton indulgences of
   self; our wants would be for the most part discovered to be fictitious,
   and our permitted indulgences to be a luxurious and dangerous softness.

   It would seem, then, that the rules by which any one who has the care
   of a family committed to him should proceed are these: First, to
   provide for those depending on him whatsoever is really needed for
   proper food, raiment, and instruction of life; next, for the
   maintenance of his relations to others among whom the providence of God
   has cast his lot. We hear much of the duty of maintaining our position
   in society; and it is a worldly way of expressing what, beyond all
   doubt, is a truth, namely, that the circumstances of our birth, and the
   intellectual and moral condition into which we have been brought, are
   facts determined by the will of God; and as such demand a reverent
   observance. The whole political and social state of mankind is the work
   and ordinance of God; and therefore all the parts of it are the
   subjects of His disposition, and all parts and members of it have their
   functions, duties, and responsibilities, which we may not without
   strong and special reasons neglect or withdraw from. It cannot be
   doubted, therefore, that we are bound, for the sake of others to whom
   we are thus related, to bear our part in the burden of society. But
   nothing that has been said warrants our going beyond the strictest
   interpretation of what that position absolutely demands. And they that
   will fairly, and without secret inclinations to a lax judgment,
   ascertain what their position in life really demands, will find its
   exactions incredibly small. Again: it is undoubtedly the duty of pa
   rents to lay by such a measure of their means of life as a discreet
   foresight, checked by an honest trust in the providence of God, will
   prescribe. But this will not warrant hoarding, or carefulness to
   increase in wealth, or to leave riches to heirs and successors. It
   warrants no more than such a care for others as prudence, I may say
   honesty, prescribes for ourselves. Now these principles may be fairly
   and safely laid down for the direction of those that desire, in the
   midst of worldly cares and burdens, to imitate at least the spirit of
   our Lord's poverty. If, after satisfying these obligations, there
   remain any yearly income, it may be administered as the patrimony of
   the poor. And they that possess it may, to an extent and in matters
   which it is impossible to describe, follow the poverty of Christ by
   personal self-denials. It has pleased God to ordain the lot of many of
   His most perfect servants in the midst of the riches, state, and
   glitter of the world; to charge them with great possessions, vast
   revenues, large dominions, high offices, and a numerous retinue. Some
   times they have been set on thrones, or detained in courts and councils
   of state; or they have had great lordships, and the responsibility of a
   spiritual rule, and their whole life and outward condition has been
   full of power, and dignity, and worldly encumbrances. And yet in the
   midst of all, by secret self-denial and self-renouncement, they have
   lived a life of personal poverty in the presence of luxury and
   splendour. I put these as extreme cases; for what was possible in them
   must be easy to us. If they whose outward state was the very antagonist
   and contradiction of our Lord's poverty, could in secret make
   themselves poor like Him, then much more may we all, whose outward
   state is moderate and easy to control. All that is needed is energy of
   will and perseverance in maintaining the practice of personal
   self-denial. No one can say how far he may be able to advance in the
   spirit of poverty till he has tried it. A mind truly bent on following
   our Lord in this part of His humiliation will discover seasons, and
   times, and opportunities of exercising it, which it is impossible to
   set down. If one were to do so, it would lose its grace and dignity,
   and seem trivial, unmeaning, commonplace, unworthy of the greatness and
   sanctity of the subject. It must be left, therefore, to the conscience
   of each person. And so it may be dismissed; once more saying, that what
   has been here thrown out is practicable for all persons, in whatsoever
   rank of life, even for the very highest in this earthly state; for the
   most burdened with worldly relations and offices; for the most
   encumbered with household cares, and the like; because, after all, it
   depends chiefly upon the secret mortification and impoverishment of the
   heart, which may be perfect, even when the natural expressions of it in
   act and deed are not permitted.

   But there are others, as has been said, on whom the providence of God
   has laid no greater charge than to provide the little which is
   necessary for their own subsistence; and they may much more closely
   approach the example of our Divine Master. Suppose a man to receive an
   inheritance greater than his personal needs; what hinders his making
   the poor to be usufructuaries of his estate, and himself the steward,
   whose recompense is his own food and raiment? He need do no violence to
   the context of society; he may leave all things in their natural
   channel. The legal securities of his possessions would remain
   untouched. They might be bequeathed to his lawful heirs; only he would
   for sake his life-interest for the love of Christ, and to follow the
   example of His holy poverty. Perhaps the very suggestion may be thought
   almost fanatical, or at least to be a treason against the prerogatives
   of a refined selfishness by which the world is ruled. Nevertheless,
   there is in it more of reason, reality, sound sense, Christian
   prudence, than in the popular theory and practice of ordinary life. It
   is capable of being demonstrated by a severer and more certain proof
   than any worldly projects will admit, to be wise, cautious,
   forecasting, and in the highest degree expedient to the man that adopts
   it for his rule of life, and even to the world. This is taking the
   lowest ground. But let us not for get that there are higher reasons
   which will occur hereafter. Hitherto we have spoken only of those who
   are rich in this world, because to them the imitation of the poverty of
   our Lord may seem at first sight impossible. It is hardly necessary to
   do more than to say, that to those who are actually poor, His example
   is a singular consolation. It elevates their inevitable condition into
   an opportunity of following His footsteps in a path which leads to
   great perfection.

   2. Another reason for His choosing so bare and destitute a condition
   was, that He, by His poverty, might set us an example of deadness to
   the world. The gifts and allurements of the secular state are among the
   chief dangers of Christ's servants. There are very few that can resist
   the offers of wealth, ease, elevation, power, and the like. The world
   is strangely versatile and seducing, and is at the best a dangerous
   friend. Prosperity destroys not fools only. There is something
   peculiarly subtil and persuasive in high station, titles, and
   appointments, and in full homes, fair prospects, abundant incomes. What
   but this does St. John mean by saying, "Love not the world, neither the
   things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of
   the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the
   flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, are not of the
   Father, but are of the world." [158] It was to be the note of Christ's
   true followers, "they are not of the world, even as I am not of the
   world." [159] In our baptism we renounced it. And He, foreseeing its
   peculiar subtilty, and the trial of His Church, especially in the days
   when the world was to come into its fold, stamped for ever in His own
   example the visible tokens of perfect deadness to the secular state, by
   choosing for Himself a life of poverty. "Though He was rich, yet for
   our sakes He be came poor." He gave Himself for us, "that He might
   deliver us from this present evil world." [160] And in His own visible
   example He shewed openly the work He came to do. He stood out from the
   world, apart from all its powers, gifts, and greatness. He had no share
   in it, and it had nothing in Him. In the full tide of life He was as
   dead to it as upon the Cross. It was simply colourless, tasteless,
   powerless. He was there to counterwork the whole mystery of this
   tempting world, and to abolish all its lures. And this He did first by
   Himself. He stood aloof from it, disengaged and free to rebuke, warn,
   condemn, abase it. And such is the condition on which alone we can
   overcome the world. Just in the measure in which we accept its favours,
   and consent to be honoured, gifted, enriched by it, we give it hostages
   or make ourselves its hirelings. I am not speaking of gross
   worldliness, ambition, and covetousness. They are self-condemned. I
   mean that far more insidious form of worldliness, in which interest and
   advancement seem to coincide with the line of duty. Men think they
   ought to refuse nothing that comes to them: as if all offers were
   necessarily from God; as if, by indirect means at least, and through
   the agency of the world, Satan could not in some measure fulfil his
   words, "all these things will I give thee." Now it is a remarkable
   fact, that many men to whom the world seems to open itself that they
   may set themselves in its very heart, in places of the greatest power,
   influence, popularity, lose their real force in the measure in which
   they advance into it, and are simply powerless when they are at the
   highest point of apparent mastery. The world knows with whom it has to
   do, and lays its ambush for those who in secret are still alive to it.
   While they seem to be carrying God's kingdom into the very core of the
   world, they are only taken in a snare. Their admonitions, reproofs, and
   rebukes, with how much soever of human emotion and effect, fall very
   light upon it. The world hires them as eloquent orators to grace a
   feast-day, or "as one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on
   an instrument," to drive away the vexing spirit, when, in spite of
   itself, it is disquieted. In the turmoil and onward movement of its
   affairs, when the blood stirs, and plans are laid deep, and great casts
   are ventured, for pleasure, or gain, or self-exaltation, the voice of
   the charmer is drowned, or rudely bid to be still, and he himself cast
   out. A pitiful lot; full of humiliation and heart-breaking when any
   deep or noble thought is still in a man! What might not such have been
   and done, if only they had been dead to the world, had refused its
   offers, and used no powers but those which God bestowed, or they
   themselves had wrung by force from the world itself! This is another
   great lesson set us in the poverty of our Lord: so to die to the world,
   that it cannot find the price at which to buy our submission. This is
   the secret of strength and stedfastness: when the prince of this world
   hath nothing in us, nothing to which he can speak smooth things through
   the eye, or through the ear; when for us gold has no brightness, and
   honour is a burden, and high office wearisome to bear, and the
   multitude of followers make us long to be forgotten, and the manifold
   duties of exalted station are irksome to the soul whose single
   intention is to be united with the presence of God, then we are
   beginning to learn what it is to be dead to the life of the world. And
   this temper is an absolute condition to the doing of any great and high
   service for Christ in His Church. There is a poverty of design, a
   weakness of purpose, an uncertainty and vacillation about all who still
   harbour a secret affection for the world. Howsoever high their theories
   or aspirations, there is some sidelong glance at the opinion, or
   judgment, or standard of others, which mars the singleness of their
   aim; some remote interest which pulls them back; some calculation of
   results, some forecasting of consequences, which make them seldom true
   to their present position or to themselves. But the man that covets
   nothing, seeks nothing, looks for nothing, nay, that would refuse and
   reject the solicitations of the world, unless they bore on them some
   sure and expressive marks of his Master's hand, is above all worldly
   power. He is truly independent; out of the reach of hope and fear;
   self-resolved, and, next under God, lord of his own spirit.

   3. And once more: the example of the Son of God was no doubt designed
   to shew us the relation between poverty and holiness. The very state of
   poverty is a wholesome corrective of many subtil and stubborn
   hindrances of our sanctification. Let us embrace it with gladness. Let
   us, when the choice is before us, choose it rather than to be rich. In
   His awful warnings on the danger of riches, our Lord neither meant to
   say that rich men could not be saved, nor that the abuse of riches
   alone is dangerous; but that the very possession of them is full of
   peril. They intoxicate the heart; they raise its pulse above the
   natural beat, and make the desires of the mind flushed and feverish.
   Even the blameless and upright among rich men are full of artificial
   feelings, false sympathies, unreal standards of what is necessary,
   becoming, and right. Riches take them out of the universal category of
   man, and train them up in a sickly and unnatural isolation from the
   real wants, sorrows, sufferings, fears, and hopes of mankind. Certainly
   they hinder, in a marked degree, the secret habits of humiliation,
   self-chastisement, and self-affliction, without which no high reach of
   sanctity is ever attained. How can a man who, without toil, fore
   thought, or faith, lives daily on a full fare, and is warm and well
   furnished, put himself in the point of sight from which alone the
   Sermon on the mount or the Passion of our Lord can be fully read? There
   must be something of antipathy between states that are so remote, if
   not opposed. It is not only the pampered and luxurious, but the easy
   and full, who harbour strange desires, excessive anxieties, irregular
   wishes, foolish cares. There is something of self-worship, which
   greatly retards their sanctification, and even hinders their conversion
   to God. Now, poverty is a very whole some medicine for all this; sharp,
   indeed, and rough to the taste, yet full of potent virtues. It is a
   sort of discipline--the ascetic rule of God's providence. They that are
   poor are already and unconsciously under a discipline of humility and
   self-denial. What so chastens the desires of the heart, and restrains
   them within due bounds and order? what so reduces a man within the
   limit of his own sphere? How great simplicity and abstinence of mind
   there is in the poor of the world. A hard life, scanty fare, coarse
   raiment, plain food, a low-roofed dwelling, are all they have, and the
   continuance of them all they desire. Surely none stand fairer for
   Christ's kingdom than they. From what unnumbered temptations,
   day-dreams, hankerings, schemes, speculations, snares, are they
   altogether free. Their whole life lies in the well-known precinct of a
   lonely hamlet, where, from birth to the grave, they dwell in familiar
   daily converse with the very stones, and trees, and brooks, with simple
   and true thoughts of life and death, and the realities of our fallen
   state. How clear and direct is their insight into the world beyond the
   grave. How little have they to divide their thoughts with God. How soon
   they release themselves from life. How simply they die. What are our
   hurried days and waking nights, but the tyranny of a multitude of
   thoughts, which are worldly, ambitious, selfish, or needless, empty,
   and vain? What is it that keeps us perpetually straining, and moiling,
   and wearing ourselves away, but some desire which is not chastened,
   some thought of the heart which is not dead to this worldly state? What
   makes us lament the flight of time, and the changes of the world, but
   that we are still a part of it, and share its life? What makes us die
   so hard, but that we leave behind us more treasures than we have laid
   up in heaven--that our hearts are not there, but here? How much of
   mercy and meaning does this put into all worldly reverses. The loss of
   fortune is, as it were, a call to perfection; the appointment of a poor
   lot in life, or of a precarious livelihood, are tokens of His will to
   make us share in the likeness of His poverty. Let us bless Him for
   every degree of approach He permits us to make towards His perfect
   life. Whether we be in the sacred or secular state, let us use the
   narrowness of worldly fortunes as a means of chastening our desires,
   subduing our thoughts, strengthening our trust in His care for us, and
   in making ourselves independent of all things but His truth, His
   Spirit, the laws of His Church, and the hope of His heavenly kingdom.

SERMON XVI.

  DEVOTION POSSIBLE IN THE BUSIEST LIFE.

    ST. MARK vi. 30, 31.

   "And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told Him
   all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught. And He
   said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest
   a while; for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure
   so much as to eat."

   THERE is something very cheerless to our minds, in this insight into
   the life of our Lord. What unceasing toil was His! All day long crowded
   upon and thronged by the multitude, "coming and going" early and late;
   and He without home or shelter, and "no leisure so much as to eat." His
   rest was in prayers and watching under a mid night sky; His secret
   chamber the wilderness. "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place,
   and rest a while." This was, no doubt, a particular occasion, probably
   when the Jews were going up to the Passover; and yet such seasons came
   not seldom in His life.

   It would seem, indeed, as if our blessed Lord had in all things assumed
   the most painful lot of which our humanity is capable. He chose for His
   portion every thing we can endure. And surely in this there is great
   consolation, and a direct admonition for our guidance. We may take His
   life, as it is here manifested to us, as an example to those whose lot
   in this world is labour.

   We are apt to think that a busy life is hardly compatible with a life
   of devotion. And we unconsciously make two rules of holy living; one
   for those who are busied in the world, and another for those who are
   free from the necessity of earning their bread. For instance, we
   tacitly assume that the poor can do no more than live lives of general
   religious obedience; that habits of devotion % or of minute personal
   discipline, are too refined and remote from them. So again in the case
   of men who are engaged in traffic and commerce, or in learned
   professions, or in the administration of law, or the government of the
   country; that is, traders, merchants, lawyers, politicians, statesmen,
   and the like. Whether we are aware of it or no, we are inclined to
   think that they may take a lower tone in the whole life of religion,
   and indulge themselves in freer habits, and aim at a less perfect
   standard of personal devotion. We seem to allow that attendance at
   daily prayers in the church, frequent communion, reading of holy
   Scripture in private, habits of religious meditation, and fasting, are
   next to impossible for men who lead busy and laborious lives. And they
   are ready enough to catch at what we allow. It is the very plea they
   put forward for exemption from the higher precepts and rules of a holy
   life. Sometimes this is done with no regret, but rather with a tone of
   perfect contentment: some times it is used to justify a thousand
   omissions of religious duty, and to make neglects appear inevitable;
   and sometimes, though, alas, but seldom, it is a subject of much
   disquiet, fear, and sadness.

   Let us, then, consider this subject in the light which the example of
   our Lord throws upon it.

   We may learn from His life of toil, that there is nothing in a life of
   perpetual labour to hinder our attaining to the highest measure of
   perfection. There was never any one whose life was fuller of endless
   employments, or more broken by countless interruptions, than His. This
   may shew us that the most laborious may be the holiest of saints.
   Indeed, the greatest saints are those who have been most like to their
   Lord in perpetual labours: as, for instance, the prophets and apostles,
   the first converters of nations, pastors in all ages, faithful servants
   of God in all states and conditions of life.

   There are, however, two objections which may be made against this
   example. One is, that He, being sinless, must needs be independent of
   the means and conditions on which holiness depends in us, and therefore
   could suffer no obstruction by the multitude of His employments. The
   other is, that His work was not secular, but sacred; that it is an
   example in point for the labours of His pastors in the ministry of the
   gospel, but not for those whose work and calling lies in the world, in
   the merchandise, traffic, and turmoil of this earthly life. One answer
   will be enough for both these objections.

   1. It is true that He, being sinless, must needs be beyond the power of
   the worldly hindrances which obstruct a life of devotion in us. But is
   there not something really unsound in the idea that any thing which is
   our duty in life can be an obstruction to any other duty? Is it not in
   effect to say, that two laws of obedience and two obligations of the
   Divine will can cross each other, and that God can contradict Himself?
   Surely the truth must be, that whatsoever in our daily life is lawful
   and right for us to be engaged in, is in itself a part of our obedience
   to God; a part, that is, of our very religion? How long shall we go on
   believing that there is no worship of God but prayers, and psalms, and
   public litanies, and private acts of devotion? Is not obedience a
   continual worship, and the life of a holy man a continual prayer?
   Whatsoever we do, if done "to the glory of God," is true worship. The
   tillage of the earth, the sweat of the brow, the toils of reason, the
   labours of the learned, the industry of merchants, the justice of
   magistrates, the wisdom of lawgivers, all these severally are the work
   entrusted to each of God; and when done in obedience to Him, are as
   direct a sacrifice of worship as the praise of our lips and the chants
   of choirs, solemn processions and the pomp of festivals. So far, then,
   from our worldly duties being obstructions to a devout life, they are
   closely and intimately related to the highest law of obedience, and may
   be made the occasion and expression of a fervent spirit of devotion.
   What were the public burdens of Moses, or the household cares of Jacob,
   or the royal offices and charges of David, but occasions of daily
   obedience to the Divine will? Whensoever, then, we hear people
   complaining of obstructions and hindrances put by the duties of life in
   the way of devoting themselves to God, we may be sure they are under
   some false view or other. They do not look upon their daily work as the
   task God has set them, and as obedience due to Him; or they are
   conscious that in their daily work there is something which is not
   wholly lawful; or that it is not carried on altogether by lawful means;
   or they know that they permit it to interfere with the duties of
   religion; or they do not rightly know what the duties of religion are;
   or they think devotion to be an occasional state of the mind separate
   and remote from the work of life, and even opposed to it. Now, people
   talk in this way as if they really held, with the Manicheans, that this
   world is the creation of an evil being, and that all things relating to
   it must needs clash with the holiness of the Supreme God. Let us, then,
   lay this down as an axiom, that whatsoever be the duties of our lot in
   life, they are the sphere and field in which God would have us to serve
   Him. They can obstruct nothing of the hidden life in us, so long as we
   have a clear sight of God in them, and do them all for His sake. And
   this answers the second objection. The distinction of secular and
   sacred is but external; all duties are sacred. Let us not think that
   there is no serving God except in the direct ministry of His Church. It
   is true that the pastors of Christ have this great privilege, that all
   their daily work is visibly and distinctly related to the will of God
   and to the habit of personal devotion. Our duties and our devotions are
   almost one and the same act. And this is a singular and inestimable
   benefit, for which we must answer with a fearful strictness at the last
   day. But the pastor and the peasant, the catechist and the sower, the
   bishop ruling in the Church and the judge sitting in the gate, the
   saint in his closet and the faithful householder ordering his family,
   all these are serving their Father in heaven by a simple, direct, and
   accept able service. Their circumstances, as we say, in life, that is,
   the outer world of relations, duties, employments, by which they are
   encompassed, are the deliberate appointments of God's providence, and
   may be taken as a revelation in fact of the kind of service He requires
   of them. It is through these appointments that we are to worship God
   with the reverence and obedience of our whole heart. A life of devotion
   does not mean a life of separation from active duties, but the
   discharge of all offices, high or low, from the most sacred and
   elevated to the most secular and menial, in a devout spirit.

   2. But we may go farther; and say, not only that the duties of life, be
   they never so toilsome and distracting, are no obstructions to a life
   of any degree of inward holiness; but that they are even direct means,
   when rightly used, to promote our sanctification. For what are all our
   duties, toils, and cares, but the lot which God in His mercy appointed
   to man after the fall? "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
   till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
   dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." [161] It matters not
   what is the form of our labour, or the condition of our calling in
   life. The cares of princes, no less than the labours of the herdsman
   and the tillage of the ground, are all fruits of the same law of toil
   which God imposed upon Adam when he sinned: and it was hardly so much a
   curse as a blessing; hardly so much a penalty as a merciful provision.
   What would have been the career and destiny of man, if, after falling
   from righteousness and from God, he had been left in the free
   possession of all created things; if, with a heart corrupt, all the
   fruitfulness and richness of paradise had still been his earthly
   portion? Surely Heaven would have sickened at the sight of man: earth
   would have groaned under the burden of his sloth, lust, and atheism. Is
   there not mercy in the niggardliness of the earth, and the overcasting
   of the sky, and the changes of storm, and wind, and cold, and tempest,
   by which this world chastises our sloth and intemperate desires? If
   labour were not the lot of sinners, verily Babylon and Nineveh, Sidon
   and Tyre, Sodom and Gomorrah, would be but faint types of the pride and
   rebellion of mankind. Now, in this view we may look upon our calling
   and work in life as a humiliation, as a token of the fall. In the case
   of pastors and preachers of the gospel it is manifestly so. The Church
   it self is a witness that sin has entered into the world. If there were
   no sin, then there would be no need of a ministry of reconciliation, of
   sacraments of renewal, of the pastoral rod, or the fold separate from
   the world. So again in the highest civil employments: what are kings
   and princes, ministers and statesmen, but witnesses that the government
   of God has been shaken off, and that men must be governed by the sword?
   The same truth is still more evident in the professions which are
   devoted to war, to healing, to litigation; and hardly less in those
   which relate to the clothing, food, and necessities of this earthly
   life: the traces of the fall are upon them all. Now, if men would see
   their daily employments in this light, it would work a wonderful change
   in the feeling with which they undertake and pursue them: it would
   hardly be possible for a man to be proud, covetous, or ambitious in the
   very matter which reminds him that he is a fallen beings, and in a
   condition which is the portion of a sinner. This is a strange reading
   of all worldly greatness. How will the world bear to hear that all the
   pomp and splendour of thrones and legislatures, of courts and councils,
   and all its wealth, its "merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious
   stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and
   scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all
   manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and
   marble, and cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and
   wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and
   horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men;" [162] that all
   this is no more than a gorgeous display of its fall from God? This
   humbling view of our daily work in the world will be very wholesome, in
   making us go to it as sinners, and in admonishing us to do our duties
   in humility and patience. In this way it will help to perfect our
   repentance; it will remind us that, at our best estate in this world,
   if we compare it with the bliss and rest of paradise, we are as the
   prodigal, outcast and naked, toiling under a base servitude in a far
   country. We shall therefore bear our daily task as a deserved and
   salutary yoke, by which we acknowledge our condition as penitents. The
   weariness, crosses, disappointments, and vexations, which arise in it;
   the early hours and late; the crowding and thronging of the multitude;
   all these are but as the dust, ashes, and sackcloth, of our just
   humiliation.

   3. Another benefit in continual employment is, that it acts as a great
   check upon the temptations which beset an unoccupied and disengaged
   man. If we could reckon up the temptations which have assaulted us in
   life, we should find by far the greater number have come upon us in
   seasons of relaxation, when the mind is vacant, wandering, and off its
   guard. Employment, even of a mechanical sort, much more real toil and
   active labour, are most beneficial to us. Next to prayer and a life of
   devotional habits, there is nothing that keeps the heart so pure, and
   the will so strong and stedfast, as a life of active duty. This is no
   doubt one peculiar blessing of those who live hard and laborious lives,
   and accounts, in great measure, for the singular simplicity,
   straightforwardness, unconsciousness of evil, which is to be found
   among the labouring poor. Their poverty, and daily intentness of mind
   upon the pure and simple tillage of the earth, shields them from a
   thousand assaults of evil, and a whole world of dangerous thoughts,
   schemes, desires, and designs, which throng upon the idle or
   unemployed. Compare the open and natural character of a poor man with
   the complex, suppressed, inward mind of those who live in the world
   with much time at their disposal, and little or no laborious work. It
   is like the transparency of a child by the side of a darkened and
   deteriorated manhood. A lawful and regular employment, somewhat
   laborious, and even absorbing (so that it does not estrange a man's
   mind from God), is a great security against the temptations of the
   world and of our own hearts. It shuts out the approaches of temptations
   with out number; and keeps the mind in perfect ignorance that such
   allurements exist in the world. It is the want of some fixed and
   regular course of duty that makes even good people inconsistent,
   uncertain, wavering, and sometimes listless, unwary, and infirm.
   Unsettled thoughts, roving imaginations, idle fancies, vacant hearts,
   wandering eyes, open ears, busy tongues, are the inseparable companions
   of a man who has little to do, or no rule and order of daily
   employment. From all this, steady labour would be his protection. Work
   is the very salt of our fallen nature, and keeps it from corrupting.

   And besides this security against temptation, daily work is a daily
   discipline. It taxes us in those very habits on which a life of
   devotion rests; I mean, patience, endurance, self-control. A life of
   industry is very nearly related to a life of religion; the staple of
   the character, so to speak, is the same.

   "He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much."
   [163] It is therefore most certain, that a life which is full of order,
   precision, self-denial, is not far from the kingdom of God; of course,
   I do not mean in men who are tainted by a worldly, covetous, careful
   spirit. The presence of any evil disposition will make even that which
   is good to be dangerous. The more laborious a covetous or ambitious man
   is, so much the worse; so much the more is he estranged from God, and
   enslaved by the worship of the world and of himself. I am speaking only
   of the habits in themselves, apart from any particular quality or
   direction. They are the very same as those of the faithful servant, who
   traded well with his lord's money, and are therefore capable of being
   sanctified by an habitual recollection of heart, and by remembrance of
   the presence of God. And besides this, there is in all continual
   employment, even in the ministries of faith and charity, a sense of
   exhaustion and weariness, which is a wholesome memorial of our
   infirmity. Every day as our strength goes from us, and every night as
   we lie down to sleep, there is an admonition of our fallen state. We
   are not as they "that excel in strength," whose living powers of
   obedience never waste; but one half of our life is spent in repairing
   the decays of the other half; and our Father in compassion draws a veil
   of darkness over us, and hides our humiliation, as it were, from heaven
   and earth. "Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour, until the
   evening;" and then "the night cometh, in which no man can work." Toil
   and rest are God's ordinance; He has joined them together, and man may
   not put them asunder. We can not toil without resting, nor rest without
   toiling: for that is no rest, but a guilty and dangerous sloth, in
   which all the powers and energies of the soul are slackened and
   stupified. We find, therefore, one universal sign of a holy life is
   habitual work--whether it be spiritual labour or secular is all one. A
   true Christian abhors idleness and protracted relaxation: he has
   something which warns him that his work is standing still, and that his
   own soul needs the discipline of labour to keep it within the rule of
   obedience; to tame its motions and chasten its desires; and for this,
   the work of the world may be, in one sense, even a better discipline
   than that of pastors; for it has in it more of weariness and
   humiliation, and less of many subtil dangers. They who labour in the
   world, in its marts, and courts, and treasure-houses, among the press
   and struggle of contentious and covetous men, if they have any
   reflection, any aspiration after the unseen rest, will be able to
   convert their daily business and profession into a wholesome
   discipline, and to look upon it as a burden which has in it not a
   little of shame and of the Cross. In this way hindrances shall turn to
   helps; and that which others yield to as an obstruction shall to them
   be come a furtherance. It teaches them the emptiness and unrest of the
   world, and drives them, by a strong counteraction, to the only true
   rest, which is Jesus Christ.

   But nothing that has been said must be thought to imply that a life of
   employment has not its peculiar difficulties. We need only look at busy
   men, and see how few are really devout, to satisfy ourselves that there
   must, after all, be some great dangers attending a life of constant
   occupation. And that is most true. What I have shewn is this, that it
   is not labour and business, as such, that hinder men from a life of
   religion; but, on the contrary, that a busy man has many peculiar
   advantages, and that he may turn his whole employment into a discipline
   nearly related to religion. But it must be confessed, that few really
   do so. It may be well, therefore, in conclusion, to notice one or two
   of the reasons which seem to account for this fact.

   1. And, first, it is because men engaged in laborious lives are very
   liable to get too much absorbed in things out of themselves. Their
   work, aims, projects, professions, and the like, grow to an unnatural
   importance, and encroach upon all their thoughts. Also, they become
   fond of the mere energy and habit of business. Dexterity, skill,
   foresight, calculation, become things pleasant in themselves, and are
   enjoyed for their own sakes. The effect of this is, that the first and
   governing rule of their thoughts and habits, and of the times and
   arrangements of every day, is their work. Their prayers in private are
   regulated as to length with a view to punctuality in business. The
   order of their household also is determined by it. The public offices
   of the Church, except on Sunday, are given up as impossible; frequent
   communion is avoided, as needing more habitual preparation than they
   can give to it. As a theory, they admit that the life of a Christian,
   as we find it in the Bible,--devout, thoughtful, collected, estranged
   from the world,--is the standard at which they ought to aim; but in
   practice, the example of others engaged in the same business or calling
   as themselves is the measure of their Christianity. As a fact, religion
   does not govern their life; it is only one of the secondary forces
   which help to determine their character.

   2. Another effect, which is a consequence of the last, is, that they
   become forgetful of their own interior life. They live out of
   themselves. Their objects, aims, impulses, measures, rules, are with
   out. They grow mechanical and external. This is sadly evident in many
   kinds of men, as, for example, among such of the hard-working poor as
   are not under the power of religion; and it is from these instances
   that men draw hasty and false conclusions. Some of them do, indeed,
   live a sort of animal life, toiling, feeding, and restings, as if they
   were created only to carry burdens, and to break up the soil of the
   earth. In such cases, it is difficult to overstate their insensibility
   and unconsciousness of all that makes up the hidden life of the soul.
   Acts of self-examination, reflection, religious meditation, and even
   prayer, are so strange and remote from their habitual thoughts and
   employments, that it is with the greatest difficulty they can be
   brought so much as to understand what these things mean. Theirs is a
   life of sight and sense, a life of the body rather than of the soul.
   But it is not only among the poor that such are to be found. It is
   still more true of those who live in the midst of ambitious contests or
   speculations of gain; with this difference, that there is a high
   excitement of the intellectual powers, and a refined hardness of the
   heart, which make them even more impenetrable to the power of truth,
   and still more estranged from the discipline of their inner life. That
   which the world praises as enthusiasm in their profession,
   self-forgetfulness, devotedness to great aims, and the like, does
   really in most cases contain an utter neglect of their own true
   immortality. It is one of the saddest thoughts, that some of the
   greatest men of the world, as lawgivers, orators, leaders, statesmen,
   have lived and died, if not in open breach of the Divine laws, at least
   in an utter insensibility to their own spiritual being, its probation,
   and its destiny.

   3. And lastly, this self-neglect leads directly to an entire
   forgetfulness of God. Indeed, it includes it. The two go together and
   involve each other. People, by losing sight of their own hidden life,
   soon lose also all perception of things unseen, and of the Divine
   presence as manifested in this world. It is this that makes the whole
   doctrine, ritual, and discipline of the Catholic Church, the whole
   mystery of sacraments and of the communion of saints, seem not only a
   perplexed and untenable theory, but to be a mere dream or vision of
   superstitious minds. To minds that live for this world, and for what
   may be seen, touched, and handled, there must be a provoking unreality
   about the whole theory of the Church. The very word mystical' is a word
   of reproach in the mouth of the world. All hidden agencies which are
   not calculable by science, all preternatural causes which cannot be
   reduced to a formula, or explained by processes of reason, all precepts
   and rules of which the direct bearing and consequence is not
   perceptible, are, to men trained in the service of the world, an
   imagination and a delusion. Now this does of course destroy all habits
   of devotion. There can be no life of prayer and communion with the
   unseen Presence, where the very Presence itself, if not doubted, is
   clouded and banished from our habitual consciousness. If the unseen
   world with draw itself, and all its glorious realities become pale and
   dubious, how can our hearts open and yearn towards it? And such is the
   state to which the business, traffic, and work of this world may bring
   us.

   But if there be any truth in what has been said before, the blame of
   this must be wholly our own. We can never come to this state, unless we
   allow the world to sap and to seduce our hearts away from us. What
   should have been the token of our humiliation, the chastisement of our
   spirits, and the discipline of our life, we have converted into a
   temptation and a snare; a burden to oppress our conscience, and a
   stimulus to excite our fallen nature. We have merged our Christianity
   in the world, and taken its maxims and rules to be the laws of our
   regenerate life.

   Most true it is, that a life in the midst of the world is a life of
   peculiar danger. Employments, offices, charges, professions, bring
   great entanglements, doubts, and absorbing occupations. It needs a
   strong spirit to stem them in safety. To withdraw from the world is a
   sign not only of a desire for greater perfection, but of a
   consciousness of our own weakness. Let these, then, be our safeguards;
   first, to be thoroughly aware that, in a busy life, there must be
   manifold temptations; and next, that so far from being a dispensation
   from higher rules of devotion, we do indeed more truly need them. We
   need all the retirement we can get from the world to recollect
   ourselves, and to measure the deviations of our minds from the law of
   our Lord's example. We ought thankfully to take all the helps the
   Church provides for us. It was for the world, and for those who are
   forced to dwell in it, that the visible Church was set up. Without it,
   this noisy, importunate, besieging world would soon obliterate from our
   minds the traces of our unseen home. We ought to mould all our plans
   and habits of daily work upon the order of the Church, and make secular
   engagements bend and subject themselves to its sacred order of offices
   and hours. Daily prayers, the continual admonition of visible rites and
   tokens of faith, frequent receiving of the holy communion, days of
   festival, seasons of fasting, necessary as they are for pastors and
   retired Christians, are still more urgently needed by those whose
   habitual work brings on daily decays of fervour. They have to
   strengthen themselves against a multiplied action of the world, in
   depressing and deteriorating the standard of their inner life. For
   through our own imperfection, the most lawful and innocent callings
   become occasions of our own hurt. But this we may entirely believe,
   that, if we will seek God in all our employments, He will convert them
   into a discipline of perfection; they will help us onward in our
   course; in the work of the world we shall be sanctified. Even in the
   unlikeliest duties and seasons, the most secular and remote from a
   devout life, when all seems dry, parched, and earthly, He will make us
   to understand that His grace is sufficient for us. He will fulfil His
   promise, "When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and
   their tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God
   of Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers in high places, and
   fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a
   pool of water, and the dry land springs of water." [164]

SERMON XVII.

  PRAYER A MARK OF TRUE HOLINESS.

    ST. MARK i. 35.

   "And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, He went out,
   and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."

   THE Evangelists seem especially guided to record, for our instruction,
   the private devotions of our Lord: they speak of them with a frequency
   and a particularity which shews how large a portion of His life was
   spent in prayer to God. We read in one place, "When He had sent the
   multitudes away, He went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when
   evening was come, He was there alone." [165] Again: "And He withdrew
   Himself into the wilderness, and prayed." Again: "And it came to pass
   in those days, that He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued
   all night in prayer to God." [166] And again: "And it came to pass
   about an eight days after these sayings, He took Peter and John and
   James, and went up into a mountain to pray. And as He prayed, the
   fashion of His countenance was altered, and His raiment was white and
   glistering." [167] Now all these things bring vividly before us His
   habitual communing with His heavenly Father, before daybreak, all night
   long, in solitary places, on the mountain, in the wilderness; they
   teach us that a large part of His earthly life He spent in prayer. Now,
   there are many points of instruction suggested to us by this; but that
   to which I desire to refer is, the mysterious fact that He did pray Who
   is One with the Father and the Holy Ghost. Why should He who was
   sinless, perfect, and in need of nothing, pray? In one word, because,
   although as God He hears the prayers of men, yet as Man it was an act
   proper to His true humanity.

   Let us consider, then, the reasons why in this He must needs have been
   as we are.

   1. First of all, without doubt, He prayed for the furtherance of that
   work which His Father had given Him to do. It is remarkable, that the
   occasions of retirement and prayer mentioned by the Evangelists are
   those which precede the miracle of walking on the water, the going
   forth to preach, the choice of the apostles, the transfiguration, the
   temptation of Peter, and His own betrayal in the garden. Thus far His
   prayers seem to have reference to His work; and He Himself declared of
   the lunatic whom His disciples could not heal, "this kind goeth not out
   but by prayer and fastings." [168] It is plain, then, that His praying
   was no mere conformity to our necessities, no economy to serve only as
   an example for us; but a real supplication for such things as the work
   He had taken in hand demanded. What those things may be, it is not for
   us to imagine. For Himself, nothing could be needed. There was in Him
   virtue to move mountains, and to suspend the laws of the world. It may
   be, that His prayers were for those on whom and in whose favour His
   miraculous powers were to be exerted, inasmuch as their efficacy
   depended on the moral state of those who were to be subjects of His
   grace. In one place we read, "He did not many mighty works there
   because of their unbelief." To the two blind men He said, "According to
   your faith be it unto you." [169] His prayers, then, it may be, were
   for those on whom His power and His words should fall, that they might
   be disposed by the Spirit of God for the reception of His saving grace;
   or, as in the choice and mission of His apostles, that they might be
   true and faithful messengers of the kingdom of heaven. So also in His
   prayer for the unity of His Church at the last supper; and in His
   supplication on the cross, "Father, forgive them; they know not what
   they do:" what were these, but the beginnings of His all-prevailing
   intercession for us before the throne of God? The whole world, from its
   first sin to its last judgment, lay before Him; and the subtilty of
   Satan, the power of death, the misery of mankind, were ever on His
   soul. All holy Himself, yet in the midst of so great a fall of God's
   creation, how could there lack matter for continual prayer? Amidst the
   contradiction of sinners, and the deadness of the unbelieving, with the
   foresight of the great sin of the world which should be committed in
   His own Passion, with the whole career and probation of His Church
   through this perilous world, before His prophetic intuition, we may in
   some little measure understand what yearning desires of love and sorrow
   moved Him to all but unceasing intercession.

   2. But His prayers were not altogether for others. Deeply mysterious as
   it is, they were offered also for Himself. We should hardly dare to say
   so, if holy Scripture were not most plain and explicit. For instance,
   when He entered for the last time into Jerusalem, He said, "Now is My
   soul troubled: and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour:
   but for this cause came I unto this hour." [170] And at the last
   supper: "Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son." Again: "And now, O
   Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self with the glory which I had
   with Thee before the world was." [171] And in His agony in the garden:
   "O My Father, if it he possible, let this cup pass from Me:
   nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt. . . . He went away again
   the second time, and prayed, saying, O My Father, if this cup may not
   pass away from Me, except I drink it, Thy will be done. . . . . And He
   left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the
   same words." [172] "And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly: and
   His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the
   ground." [173] It is, no doubt, of this awful passage of His life in
   particular, though perhaps not exclusively, that St. Paul writes, "Who
   in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and
   supplications with strong crying and tears unto Him that was able to
   save Him from death, and was heard in that He feared; though He were a
   Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered." [174]
   And in that last agony we read expressly, as if in answer to His
   prayers, "there appeared an angel from heaven, strengthening Him."
   [175] Wonderful humiliation of the Son of God, to faint, to be in an
   agony, to pray, to be strengthened by an angel! Into this deep and
   hidden conflict of soul we can not penetrate; but from it we may learn
   the awfulness of sin and death, which could thus afflict the Word made
   flesh; and the mighty strength of prayer, which stayed up His soul, and
   drew from heaven an angel to uphold Him in the hour of darkness. It was
   a property of His true humanity that He should derive strength through
   prayer; and a part of His humiliation for us that He should need to
   pray.

   3. And once more. He prayed while He was on earth, because prayer was
   the nearest return to the glory which He laid aside when He was made
   Man. It was, if we may so speak, His only true dwelling, rest, home,
   delight. We read of His weeping, and His being wearied, of His being
   troubled in spirit; but we never read that He rested, except upon the
   brink of a well by the wayside; nor that He slept, except in the ship.

   Most utterly sad and desolate His outward lot in this world. "Foxes had
   holes, and the birds of the air had nests; but the Son of Man had not
   where to lay His head."

   Prayer and converse with His Father in heaven was the only shelter into
   which the world could not break. Where He prayed was holy ground, and
   for the time was altogether His own. And to the mountain and the
   solitude He with drew, leaving all, even the disciple whom He loved,
   that He might hold converse with His Father in heaven. It is remarkable
   that the public tokens of love which were given Him from heaven were
   all in acts of prayer. At His baptism, St. Luke writes, "Jesus also
   being baptised and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost
   descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from
   heaven, which said, Thou art My beloved Son; in Thee I am well
   pleased." [176] At His transfiguration we read that He "went up into a
   mountain to pray. And as He prayed, the fashion of His countenance was
   altered, and His raiment was white and glistering. And, behold, there
   talked with Him two men, which were Moses and Elias: who appeared in
   glory, . . . and a cloud overshadowed them; . . . and there came a
   voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son: hear Him."
   [177] What may have been the visitations of His Father's love and
   consolation in His secret communion with Him, we cannot so much as
   conceive. Without doubt they were times of unspeakable bliss; when the
   light of God's countenance, and the fulness of His Father's love, were
   shed abroad in His soul. What must have been the communing of the Word
   made flesh with His heavenly Father; what mingling of eternal love,
   what perfect unity of will! And may we not believe that He, by whose
   Spirit the prophets spake of old, foresaw at all times, but specially
   in seasons of retired communion with God, the full mystery of love, the
   abolition of sin and death, the perfect reconciliation of God and man,
   the company of the elect, the holiness of the saints, the glorious
   martyrdom of His servants, the perfection of His Church, the new
   creation of God? If in His hours of agony the darker shadows of the
   future hung upon Him, may we not believe that in His hours of prayer
   the brighter lights of His invisible kingdom shone full upon His soul?

   Now, from this view, we may learn, first, that a life of habitual
   prayer is a life of the highest perfection; and that our prayer will be
   more or less perfect in proportion as our state of holiness is more or
   less advanced. The most perfect example of prayer is His who was most
   perfect in holiness. None prayed such fervent, frequent, unwearied
   prayers as He who was without sin.

   There is something at first sight paradoxical in saying, that prayer is
   the beginning of conversion to God, and also the highest token of
   perfection. Yet so it is. Prayer is the very breath of the regenerate
   life. Without it no spirit of man can live. Prayer is also the nearest
   approach to the work of saints unseen, to the heavenly glory, to the
   beatific vision. It is well to bear this in mind; for in what do people
   more deceive and distress themselves than in the duty of prayer?
   Sometimes we see people living on in a full belief that they do pray,
   when we have every reason to believe that they have never so much as
   realised the very idea of what prayer is; for instance, persons of a
   correct life, with cold affections, strong understandings, watchful
   against what they call enthusiasm and excited feelings; or again, those
   who take the tone of the world, live in society, busy themselves with
   it usages and events; people of an external life, who live out of their
   own hearts, having their attention drawn away from themselves, and
   their thoughts active about this visible world. Now, such people are
   often exemplary in their regularity at all stated duties of religion;
   and they go through them with such a sufficiency of outward care and
   punctuality, that there appears nothing to be supplied. But, after all,
   something seems perceptibly wanting within. Perhaps it may be expressed
   in fewest words as the want of realising their own personal relation to
   God, and the nearness of His presence to them in acts of prayer. But we
   have no need to speak of others. Who is there that does not know what
   this means? Who is there that has not passed through such a state of
   dangerous insensibility; and has become conscious now, in looking back,
   for how many years his prayers were really mere recitations, without
   realising the awful directness of our approach to God? And yet all the
   time we were as unconscious of it as if there were nothing that we did
   not fully perceive. How long this deceit still hung about us! And
   though we began at last to be painfully aware of our blindness and
   lukewarmness, our wandering and distraction in the very act of praying,
   yet we never half suspected the right cause. For example, how many of
   us have felt it easier to maintain at least external reverence in
   public worship than in private prayer, partly be cause the eyes of
   others were upon us, and partly because our attention was stimulated by
   the devotions of others. When we have gone into our own private room,
   we have seemed to become altogether changed; our thoughts abroad, our
   affections cold, and our very body weary of kneeling. On the other
   hand, many people greatly distress themselves about their prayers: I do
   not say needlessly, for there is need enough; but their distress is
   often an obstruction rather than a help. They complain of indevotion,
   of inability to pray, or to fix their minds. It seems to them to be
   altogether unreal, and a sort of forced and artificial state of mind.

   Now, it is of course impossible to lay down any laws in a matter so
   mysterious, and so nearly related to the inscrutable workings of the
   Spirit of God. It is indeed true that sometimes men converted late in
   life, or after great sins, or by sudden causes, exhibit a wonderful
   vividness of compunction and a fervent spirit of prayer. But these are
   exempt cases; and even they often subside after wards into the
   condition in which the great majority of men are to be found. For the
   most part the habit of prayer keeps pace with, or but little outstrips,
   the habit of patience, meekness, humility, and the like; that is to
   say, it is matured with the maturing of the spiritual life. And indeed
   it seems plain that it must be so; for what are the springs of prayer
   but a sense of sinfulness, a desire of abasement and of sanctification?
   But before these can exist, the moral effects of past sins, by which
   the edge of the conscience has been blunted and the purity of the
   affections soiled, must be in part taken away. This is not the work of
   a day, but of a long season, often of years; and these hindrances must
   be borne as a deserved chastisement and humiliation. In this way even
   the mat ter of our distress becomes a wholesome discipline for our
   correction. We cannot, without long and persevering endeavours, imitate
   our Lord in His prayers, any more than in His patience. We must be
   first, in some measure, conformed to Him in the perfections of His
   heavenly life, before our hearts can pour themselves out in fervent
   intercessions. The most perfect prayers are those of saints and of
   little children, because in both there is the same freedom from the
   hard, unconcerned, self-contemplative habit of mind which besets the
   common sort of Christians, and the same presence of awe, tenderness of
   conscience, simplicity, and truth. The very weakness of children has
   the same effect as the strength of saints. Children have not yet
   learned to know the world, and saints have renounced it, and both are
   free from its solicitations and intrusions.

   2. There is another point to be considered. The spirit of prayer is a
   direct gift from God. This great truth has been so abused by the
   fanaticism and self-delusion of unstable men, that others of a more
   chastened temper have recoiled into the opposite extreme, They confine
   it practically, though they would not say so, to the acts of our own
   minds. To pray is a high grace given to us from heaven. For prayer does
   not mean the ready utterance which flows from excitement of
   imagination, or fluency of speech, nor any of the mere intellectual
   powers with which men have deceived others and themselves; but from the
   depth of contrition and self-reproach, from earnest resolutions of
   self-chastisement, strong aspirations after perfect holiness and the
   bliss of fellowship with God. And all these are the gifts of that One
   Spirit which "helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should
   pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us
   with groanings which cannot be uttered. And He that searcheth the
   hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because He maketh
   intercession for the saints according to the will of God." [178] After
   all our endeavours and prayers, it is from Him that we must receive the
   grace of prayer. "I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and
   they shall look on Me whom they have pierced." It is in proportion as
   we receive clearer insight into the depth and ingratitude of sin, into
   the passion and love of Christ, that we shall learn to pray. "And they
   shall mourn for Him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in
   bitterness for Him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn."
   [179]

   Prayer springs from compunction, and compunction from love to Him whom
   our sins have pierced; and to perceive this is the gift of God,
   sometimes given early in the life of a penitent, but for the most part
   after years of fear and mortification; for these perceptions are not
   emotions raised by our own efforts, nor can we by any intellectual
   process gain them, or create them for ourselves; they are in sights and
   intuitions of the Spirit freely given from above, and passively
   received by those who, in truth and sincerity of heart, have diligently
   waited upon God in prayer. There are, indeed, higher revelations with
   which He favours those whom He will: but they are not to be expressed
   in words, nor to be understood, even if they could be uttered; nor are
   they to be sought by us, being too excellent for us; nor to be
   contemplated and rested in, when given; nor are they graces that are
   necessary for salvation, but gifts vouchsafed to few. And even they who
   receive them have some counter-token to make such high endowments safe.
   He who was caught up into the third heaven, lest he should be "lifted
   up," had also sent unto him "a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
   Satan to buffet him." Let us therefore leave all, even our prayers, in
   God's hand. Let us not seek high things for ourselves, lest we should
   not be able to bear them; lest we should fall into the delusion of the
   enemy, and mistake heated and overstrained fancies for the realities of
   God's king dom. To seek after high tokens of God's favour, is to pass a
   judgment on ourselves that we are such as may expect them, and could
   receive them in humility and in safety. But they who think so, plainly
   shew that they are not such as could endure them without danger. Such
   things are rather for those who like Peter, when he saw the miracle of
   the fishes, said, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord." Yet
   even he, after that, when he saw somewhat of his Master's glory, talked
   of building three tabernacles, not knowing what he said.

   Therefore let us be lowly even in our prayers; seeking to be real and
   sincere, conscious of our infinite spiritual wants, our manifold and
   exceeding imperfections. It is beyond all our deservings that we should
   be allowed to speak with Him at all. It is enough for us that we may
   "make our requests known unto God." For all that remains let us trust
   ourselves in His hands. He will shew us such things as it is good for
   us to see in this state of humiliation. Let us, like our Lord, withdraw
   ourselves at times not only from the world, but from those dearest to
   us, from our closest friend ships and most intimate affections, that we
   may be alone with God. Let us learn how precious are solitary places,
   and hours when others are sleeping or away; in the night-season, or "a
   great while before day," when the earth and heaven are still, and the
   busy world has not yet come abroad to trouble the creation of God.

   And lastly, we may learn that, as the sacrifice of Christ is the one
   only effectual sacrifice, so is His the one only true and
   all-prevailing prayer. All our prayers are accepted in His, which are
   the life and strength of all. The intercession of His Church goes up
   perpetually through Him unto His Father. In itself it is weak and
   imperfect: but He is the life of His mystical body; and in Him the
   prayers of saints, the aspirations of pure hearts, the mourning of the
   contrite, the confessions of penitents, the strong crying of the
   afflicted, the self-reproaches of convicted sinners, ascend as one
   intercession, as a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour, to the throne
   of God. In the vision which St. John saw, an "angel came and stood at
   the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much
   incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon
   the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the
   incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before
   God out of the angel's hand." [180] This is He who "continueth ever,"
   and "hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore He is able also to save
   them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth
   to make intercession for them." [181]

SERMON XVIII.

  SHORT DEVOTIONS A HINDRANCE TO PRAYER.

    ST. LUKE vi. 12.

   "And it came to pass in those days, that He went out into a mountain to
   pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."

   WE are not to suppose, because we read this only once in the Gospels,
   that it was only this once in His life that our blessed Lord spent all
   the night in prayer. The history of His words and deeds, as it is
   written by the Evangelists, does not profess to give all that He said
   or did. Indeed, St. John expressly declares, "There are also many other
   things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one,
   I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that
   should be written." [182] We have but a small part in the four Gospels;
   and yet that part is so recorded as to contain, imply, and extend over
   all the rest. If we may reverently use a phrase of so critical a sound,
   it may be said that they contain the perfect idea and outline of His
   character, together with such instances as express the whole habit and
   principle of His life. Therefore these words of St. Luke may be taken
   to imply, not only that He passed that particular night alone in
   prayer, or in an oratory [183] on the mountain, as the words may mean,
   but that such was His wont: that long retirement and protracted
   communing with God were habitual to Him. Now the point I would notice
   is, the great length of time He thus gave to prayer; and we will
   consider how far it has the force of an example or precept to us. Many
   people will say, that it applies to us, if at all, in a very remote and
   restricted way; and the arguments they bring are not without a show of
   reason. But a little deeper thought will convince us that the reverse
   is true. We will, however, take the chief objections, and weigh them
   one by one.

   1. It is commonly said, that such prolonged acts of prayer issued from
   the perfection of His divine Person; that they were, so to speak,
   attributes of One who was without sin, and in unbroken fellowship with
   God. It cannot be denied that there is truth in this. We know that
   angels, who "excel in strength," serve God without intermission; and
   the heavenly hosts, in their adoration, "rest not day and night." In
   fact, it may be said that sustained devotion is a perfection--an
   endowment of those who are delivered from the power of sin. And a
   powerful argument comes in aid of this, from the sensible fact of our
   distraction and weariness in prayer, which seem to be universal, and to
   cleave to us, even to the best of men, to the end of life. But does not
   this objection put out of sight the most important truth of all? It is
   indeed most true, that the sustained and blissful communion which He
   held with His Father--a converse with out the wandering of a desire or
   thought, a fellowship of consolation, strength, and peace--that this,
   indeed, is beyond our reach. Few attain, even in kind, an approach to
   it; and they seldom; and many never. They who enjoy it are admitted to
   it only for a while and at seasons; with long intervals, and uncertain
   returns. In this, indeed, the example of our Master finds but a
   restricted counterpart in us. Yet it does not take off the force of it.
   His prayers were blissful as He was perfect; but ours are necessary
   because of our imperfections. We must not, however, suppose that His
   prayers were only adorations, because from one who stands in need of
   nothing. It is a mystery of faith, how He that filleth all should pray
   as if needing of another's fulness; yet it is only the mystery of the
   Incarnation in its consequences. It is akin to His temptation and His
   agony, in which He was ministered to and strengthened by angels. And we
   are expressly told that He prayed "with strong crying and tears," "and
   was heard in that He feared." [184] His prayers were uttered out of the
   depths of His sinless infirmities, and had their answers from on high;
   but in what way we know not, nor shall do well too curiously to seek.
   This brings His example nearer to us. His nights of prayer, then, were
   not simple exercises of His exceeding spiritual strength; they were
   also the earnest cleaving of man to God. And if the infirmities of a
   sinless being drew Him so mightily to God, how much more ought the sin
   that is in us to drive us to the Divine Presence for healing and for
   strength! The contrast of our weakness with His perfection gives us no
   discharge from His example: rather, it adds a greater force. It brings
   out a farther and deeper reason, which makes the law of prayer to us
   the very condition of life. If we do not pray, we perish. It is no
   answer to say we are weak, and can not continue in prayer as He. That
   very weakness is in itself the necessity which forces us to pray. His
   perfect prayers are only the standard we must aim at--the pattern of
   what our prayers should be. If ours are unlike His, so much the greater
   need to give ourselves to greater devotion: the more unlike, the more
   need there is to pray. All that can be made of this objection, then, is
   this: Such is our sinful and weak state, that His perfect devotions are
   beyond our strength. And the conclusion that follows is, therefore, not
   that we may contentedly aim at a lower rule, but that we ought all the
   more to humble, and train ourselves upon a discipline which leads to
   His perfection. In a word, the very objection which pleads the
   difficulty of following His example, proves the necessity which
   constrains us to follow it.

   2. Again, it is often said, "There can be no doubt that more time ought
   to be given by us all to the duty of prayer. Well were it if we were
   able to follow, in all things, the example of our Lord; but this is
   plainly impossible. We are entangled in the world, burdened by its
   duties and its employments; our time is not our own; it is very hard to
   get an unbroken hour. There is always some thing demanding our whole
   attention: business, labour, the claims of others, the harmless usages
   of society, the charities of life, the cares of home, the service of
   the sick and poor, the instruction of children, and the like. In a
   word, it is impossible for those who live an active and a busy life to
   find time for long private devotions."

   From the tone in which some people speak, one would think that our
   blessed Master had lived a leisurely and unimpeded life; that He had no
   thing else to do but to live alone in retirement and solitude, in
   prayer and contemplation: and this of One, whose whole life was toil,
   amid crowds and multitudes, hungry and wayworn, full of calls and
   interruptions. Certainly the life of our Lord exhibits to us the most
   perfect example of constant employments. If any thing in it be
   prominent, it is the multitude of works, the never-ending service of
   all that came or sent for Him, in sick chambers, in homes of sorrow, in
   synagogues, in Pharisees' houses, in the Temple, in the mid-stream of
   men. It were rather true to say, that hardly any man's life was ever
   yet so broken in upon, and taken from him by labour, and care, and the
   importunity of others, as His; and yet He is to us the perfect example
   of devotion. It was the toil of the day that turned His night into a
   vigil. That which we plead as excuse was the very cause why "He went
   out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."
   In which He teaches us, that whatever else we forego, we may not forego
   our prayers; whatever else is at our will to give up, this is not;
   however necessary we may think other things, this is the thing needful
   above all; our work must be done, and yet our devotions must not be
   left undone. Our Lord's example in this is especially pointed and
   instructive to those who are wont to plead their worldly duties in
   excuse. He has abolished this plea before hand; He has exposed its
   untruth by anticipation; and, moreover, He has taught us that here
   again the very reverse of this excuse is the truth. They who live in
   the world are so far from being released from stricter habits of
   private devotion, that they, above all, need them most. The busier
   their daily thoughts, the greater need of recollection at night. The
   more closely the world presses upon them all day long, the more need is
   there for them to break loose from it, and to give themselves up again
   to God, when the day is done. What else remains to them? If the world
   has indeed the dominion of their days; if so long as light lasts, their
   whole activity and all its powers must be given to trade, or
   merchandise, or studies, or official employments, or the practice of
   courts, or even to ministries of healing, as physicians and pastors;
   what remains to them, but to reclaim from the hours when at last the
   world is at rest some of the time on which it keeps so tyrannous a
   hold? Verily these are they who, most of all men, have need to "redeem
   the time, because the days are evil." [185] It is indeed true, that
   multiplicity of labours and employments makes retirement very hard to
   obtain; but it makes it all the more necessary. All activity not
   controlled by the presence of God, has in it a tendency to withdraw the
   mind from Him, and to render it less open towards Him, less susceptible
   of passive impressions, and less conscious of an unseen presence. So,
   again, all excitements, not only of a worldly and corrupting sort, as
   pleasure, gaining, ambition, and the like, but even the purer kinds,
   are adverse to devotion. A highly intellectual habit of thought, such
   as students or professional men usually live in, has a very subtil
   effect on the mind: it makes it over-active; so that the stillness and
   fixedness necessary in prayer are irksome and peculiarly difficult.
   Also it tends to dry up and to deaden the affections, on which devotion
   is chiefly engrafted. This is true even of pastors, in the study of
   divine truth, and in the exercise of their spiritual ministry.
   Over-activity often leads to indevotion, and busy care about others to
   forgetfulness of our own soul. And if this be true of us, how much more
   of those whose lot is cast in the world, and whose scene of toil is
   among the snares and secularities of life! But into this I will not go
   farther now; we shall have need to come back to it hereafter. All that
   it is necessary to say is, that the common excuse made by even
   well-meaning people for their low habits of devotion, is no excuse at
   all: rather, all the force it has is on the other side, in the way of
   warning and admonition. Alas for the man that is too busy to pray; for
   he is too busy to be saved.

   3. But once more. It may be said, "All this proves too much; for if it
   prove any thing, it proves that we ought to give up our natural rest
   and our night's sleep, and to break the common habits of a regular life
   in a way that health and sound discretion, and almost the humility
   which avoids singularities and extremes, would equally forbid." It may
   be asked, "Do you literally mean, that we ought ever to continue the
   whole night in prayer?' for if not, do you not give up the argument and
   the example; and then what measure of time will you fix?" It may not be
   amiss to say, that better men than ourselves, and that in all times,
   have seen reason to take these words even to the letter; and their
   lives have been a witness to their sound discretion, and to their
   humility. The very name of vigil, which the Church puts into our
   mouths, has some deeper and fuller meaning than we are wont to give it.
   This is an age of metaphors and accommodations: words once realities
   are now but figures, symbols of vague notions. Now-a-days a vigil is
   the evening before a Feast, in which men used in early times to watch
   and pray; and it stands for the duty of watchfulness. We have grown to
   be great masters of defining by glosses, and parables. This at least
   may be said: there are many of us who would think it reasonable and
   discreet to spend a whole night in study, or writing, or in
   conversation, or in the levities of the world, or in travelling; who
   have done and still do this, and yet have never passed a night in
   contemplation and prayer, and would think it extravagant to do so. My
   object in saying this is, to shew in what unequal scales even fair and
   religious people weigh these things. Is it not true, that people who
   would, without a word, travel many nights together for business or
   amusement, would positively resent the notion of spending even a few
   hours of Christmas or Easter Eve in prayer and self-examination?
   However, it is enough for the present purpose to say, that whosoever
   would live a life of prayer, must spend no small part of every day in
   praying. There is no art or science, no practice or faculty of which
   the human mind is capable, that demands for its acquirement so much
   time as a habit of prayer. One of the chief reasons why we find it so
   hard to pray, one of the chief causes of all our distraction,
   wandering, and indevotion, is, the infrequency and shortness of our
   prayers. It is indeed true, that prayer is in one sense a gift of God:
   He pours out on whomsoever He will "the spirit of grace and
   supplications;" [186] "the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we
   know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
   maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered."
   [187] Nevertheless, the same is equally true of purity and humility;
   they both are gifts of grace, yet subjected to the conditions of our
   nature, and to be made our own by discipline and in time. So it is with
   prayer. And, indeed, if we will but consider what the act of prayer is,
   we shall see that, of all the spiritual powers of the regenerate soul,
   it is the highest and most nearly akin to perfection. It is no less
   than speaking with God under a consciousness of His presence, with
   kindled desires, and a submitted will. It implies the presence and
   energy of faith, love, and repentance. Such as we are, such our prayers
   will be. It is the unfolding of ourselves in God's sight; and there
   must needs go before it and with it a knowledge of ourselves, founded
   on habitual self-examination. And for this, stated and not short
   seasons of silence and retirement in the presence of God are absolutely
   needed.

   Now what is actually the state of most people? They pray twice in the
   day. Their prayers are, for the most part, certain fixed and
   ever-recurring forms of devotion; in themselves good, but necessarily
   general both in confession and petition. These prayers are said over
   with more or less of attention, desire, feeling, and emotion. They
   take, it may be, a quarter of an hour in the morning, and the same at
   night. They are often not preceded by conscious preparation, nor
   followed by prescribed acts of reflection. They are parentheses in the
   day, which will not read into the context of life, but are entered and
   left by a sensible transition of the mind. To this, perhaps, is added,
   in most cases, a reading of the Bible once in the course of the day.
   With some there lingers still the remains of an excellent and most
   significant practice of reading the appointed Psalms and Lessons--a
   memorial of better times, and an unconscious act of unity, in spirit
   and intention, with those who daily pray before the altars of the
   Church. Now the time spent in these habits is half an hour in prayer,
   and perhaps the same in reading. If to this be added family prayers, a
   quarter of an hour in the morning, and the same at night, I believe we
   shall have taken no unfavourable sample of the measure of time given to
   their daily prayers by persons even of a serious and religious
   character. It cannot be doubted that such people would pass for devout
   persons; nor will I, which God forbid, gainsay their claim to be so
   esteemed. But what does it come to, after all? One hour and a half in
   every twenty-four. And how are the rest allotted? Nine or ten to sleep
   and its circumstantials, two or three hours spent over food; four or
   five, that is, whole mornings and whole evenings, given up to
   conversation, visits, amusements, and what the world calls society; the
   rest consumed in various employments of various degrees of nearness to,
   or remoteness from, the presence and thought of God. Now, assuredly, if
   this world were not a fallen world, if all its spontaneous daily
   movements were in harmony with the will of God and the state beyond the
   grave, there would be no harm in resting upon those movements, and in
   being borne along with them. But if it be indeed a world fallen from
   God; and if in its fairest forms it be still, at least by privation of
   righteousness, sinful in His sight, then to live in it as if it were
   not fallen cannot but estrange us from real communion with Him. An hour
   and a half of better thoughts in every day will not disinfect our
   hearts, and counterwork the perpetual and transforming action of the
   world in all the rest of our time. In this point, busy and toilworn
   people have an advantage over the more leisurely; for business and
   labour are a part of the fall, and have in them chastisement and
   humiliation. There is great danger, in cases like that which I have
   taken, lest such minds, though in many ways blameless and pure, should
   be strangers to the deeper things of God, and to the realities of
   compunction and devotion.

   To the case I have supposed, one more point may be added: I mean,
   attendance at the daily prayers of the Church. Measured by time, this
   adds somewhat more than another hour in the day; but after all, what is
   it? Not so much as three hours for God, and one-and-twenty for
   ourselves. Alas for us! what would they judge of us, those saints of
   old, who wore the very stones with their perpetual kneelings? What
   would they say of our distribution of time? Would they acknowledge us
   among the number of those that pray? What would they answer to our
   complaints of wandering and distraction, and unseasonable thoughts, and
   unconsciousness of God's presence? Would they wonder that it is so with
   us? I trow not. Should we not hear: "In the evening, and morning, and
   at noonday will I pray, and that instantly, and He shall hear my
   voice." "Seven times a day do I praise Thee, because of Thy righteous
   judgments." "Mine eyes prevent the night-watches, that I might be
   occupied in Thy law." "My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that
   watch for the morning: yea, I say, more than they that watch for the
   morning," "My voice shalt Thou hear betimes, O Lord: early in the
   morning will I direct my prayer unto Thee, and will look up." [188] "At
   midnight will I rise to give thanks unto Thee, because of Thy righteous
   judgments." "I have thought upon Thy name in the night-season, and have
   kept Thy law." [189]

   I will add only two remarks, and then conclude.

   1. First, it is plain that there can be no exact measure of time fixed
   for our prayers. If any were fixed, we should be in great danger of
   forming a mechanical habit, and of resting in it when mechanically
   fulfilled. It is the very character of our trial that we are under a
   law of liberty. It were easier to many to recite a prescribed number of
   prayers in a prescribed space of time, than to say one prayer with
   devotion. This is a wholesome and necessary admonition to those who
   have the blessing of the daily prayers of the Church. The salt which
   alone can keep the daily service from corruption is increased prayer in
   private. If this "have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?"
   In such frequent, prolonged, public, and, I may say, familiar
   approaches to God, there is great danger of forming a hard,
   business-like in sensibility in the very act of praying. No time, then,
   can be exactly prescribed. The end alone can measure what is needful.
   And that end is, the fellowship of a wakeful and collected mind with
   God. No time that fails to attain this, be it short or long, is enough.
   But though no mea sure of time can be fixed for all, yet one thing it
   is safe to say: we ought all of us to be longer on our knees before God
   than we are at present. And longer we should be, if we truly knew our
   own state, or if we had so much as a moment's clear perception of the
   awfulness of God's presence, or of the bliss of perfect prayer. This at
   least may be said, that to hurry suddenly into His presence, and to
   hurry out of it again, is no sign of our so much as understanding the
   first idea of worship. There is something irreverent in these sudden
   transitions; as if our minds were always meet to approach Him, and
   there were nothing needed but a momentary act of our will. Our prayers
   cannot fail to be full of distraction, if we enter upon them without
   first setting ourselves, by acts of conscious recollection, in His
   presence. What, after all, is the key of our distractions, but the fact
   that we so faintly realise the presence of God when we are upon our
   knees? Another practical rule is this: we may be sure that we do not
   give time enough to prayer, so long as either the ordinary habits of
   our life continue to thrust themselves in upon our devotions, or our
   habits of devotion fail to check and sanctify the ordinary habits of
   our life. Till we reach this point, we shall be in no danger of giving
   too much time to our prayers; and that is a sufficient and a safe
   practical answer, and a good rule to go by.

   2. The other remark I would make is, that there are peculiar
   difficulties and temptations at tending a habit of prayer, by which
   people are often greatly distressed. The more they endeavour to prolong
   their acts of prayer, the more sensible they become of the instability
   and levity of their minds. Many feel this in respect to the prayers of
   the Church, especially when the Holy Communion is administered. But
   perhaps the commonest form of this trial is in the daily service.
   Really earnest people, who delight in being, day by day, before the
   altar, and would not forfeit the prayers of morning and evening for any
   inducement, do nevertheless sometimes go through the whole service with
   a perfectly absent mind. At the beginning of every prayer they resolve
   to unite their desires to it throughout, and at the end come to
   themselves again, and perceive that all has been a blank before them.
   This is very disquieting, and fills them with painful and mistrustful
   thoughts. It is indeed a matter for compunction and humiliation. It is
   a token of their great spiritual infirmity. But it is a good thing to
   be made painfully aware of it. And this is one of the benefits
   resulting from the length of the prayers, and from the habit of daily
   service. It acts as a detector to test and exhibit their true internal
   state. With shorter and less frequent services they might have gone on
   for ever without finding out their secret indevotion; and all the while
   it would be no less real, though undiscovered. It is good to be
   convicted, lest we deceive ourselves. And the use we should make of the
   offices of the Church when we cannot follow them is, to chastise our
   indevotion by them, and to strengthen the habits of silence, reverence,
   and attention, which are the basis of a devout spirit. Even though,
   through our weakness or our sin, we fail to sustain our conscious and
   direct prayers, yet frequent and stated returns to God's presence lay
   the foundations of obedience, and obedience is the very source of
   fervent prayer. In the relaxed state of our spiritual discipline, it is
   good to have this undesigned, though somewhat austere rule. There is
   another part of our public worship, which, though not intended,
   supplies a highly beneficial practice of devotion. I mean, the great
   length of time while the Holy Sacrament is being distributed to
   communicants. Some people strongly and inconsiderately complain of
   this. But it is a blessed and wholesome thing to be so encompassed, as
   it were, by the presence of God, that for a while we can employ
   ourselves in nothing but prayer and meditation. In our busy, excited,
   intellectual, distracted life, it is a good thing to have even our
   mental activity for a while forcibly suspended, and our minds left
   wholly without support or stay, except in the thought of God. It is
   good to have even religious books withdrawn for a time; for manuals of
   devotion often divert the mind from its own personal acts, and
   substitute the thought of devotion for the reality. While the Body and
   Blood of Christ are being given to His people at the altar, we can do
   nothing but turn inwardly upon our own consciousness of His presence
   with us, and of our actual state before Him. Let us, then, look upon
   all trials and difficulties in prayer as no more than we must meet in
   the discipline of every part of a holy life. And let us be thankful
   that we are in any way brought to know how far we are fallen from God,
   how unmeet for the inheritance of the saints in light, whose ministry
   of love and worship has no intermission; only let the consciousness of
   our distractions in prayer make us pray oftener, and more; for by
   prayer alone can they be overcome. There is no other cure. Let us, in
   spite of all, cleave to this, and we shall find all well at last, when
   we shall no longer worship Him under the veil of His unseen Presence,
   but before the Throne, where our "eyes shall behold the King in His
   beauty."

SERMON XIX.

  THE LONGSUFFERING OF CHRIST.

    ST. MATT. xviii. 21, 22.

   "Then came Peter to Him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
   against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him,
   I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times
   seven."

   IN St. Luke's Gospel this same answer is given with a change of
   expression which makes it even more emphatic: "Take heed to yourselves:
   If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent,
   forgive him. And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and
   seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt
   forgive him." [190] In St. Matthew's Gospel, the parable of the two
   servants who owed, the one ten thousand talents, and the other an
   hundred pence, immediately follows. It is therefore evident, that the
   great law of mutual forgiveness is founded both on the law of nature,
   and on the fact of the still greater forgiveness which we have received
   at God's hand. If He have forgiven us so much, what is there that we
   shall not forgive our brother? if He have forgiven us so often, how can
   we ever refuse forgiveness? Seventy times seven, seven times in a day,
   what is this to those who have the forgiveness of God through the blood
   of Jesus Christ?

   But the point I wish to draw attention to is, not the duty of
   forgiveness as it is here enjoined, but the character of Christ as it
   is revealed in these words. It is plain that He does not lay on us a
   rule of mercy by which He does not proceed Himself. He has not two
   measures, or an unequal balance. As He would have us measure to others,
   so He will mete to us. The law He here lays down is a transcript of
   Himself: this seventy times sevenfold remission, what is it but His
   unwearied mercy? and what is this "seven times in a day," but His
   all-enduring patience?

   Now it is this particular truth which distinguishes the Gospel from all
   religions of nature, and even from all other measures of the earlier
   revelations of God. The great truth here revealed to us is, the love,
   clemency, forgiveness of God to sinners. All this was, indeed,
   exhibited before in promises and prophecies, and in God's manifest
   dealings with His chosen people of old; but it was never so fully
   revealed as by the Incarnation and atonement of Christ. It may be said
   with truth, that a full perception of this great mystery of mercy is
   the very life of faith; and that there is nothing we are slower and
   more unwilling to believe in its truth and fulness. The greatness of it
   is too large for our narrow hearts. It is very easy to say, God is
   merciful, Christ is full of compassion; but these general truths, as we
   utter them, are limited and overcast by others not less certain. For if
   the Gospel has revealed God's mercy, it has also revealed God's
   holiness; if it has taught us that God is Love, it has also taught us
   that He is "a consuming fire." With the atonement, we have learned the
   judgment to come; with the sacrifice of Christ, we have learned the
   guilt of sin; with the gift of regeneration, the defilement of our
   inmost soul; if baptism has brought us remission, it has made sins
   after baptism more fearful. The Gospel is an awful twofold light,
   before which even faithful Christians tremble, and often see but in
   part, and, through weakness and fear, and the earthliness of their
   hearts, often believe and speak amiss. It seems inconceivable that God
   should pardon so great sins as ours; or if He pardon us once, that He
   should pardon us when we fall again. The number and the frequency of
   our falls and swervings, the many warnings and the full light against
   which we often offend; the periodical returns of temptation, and, with
   them, of disobedience; the depth and intensity of guilt which even
   lesser sins attain by repetition after repentance; above all, when
   committed neither by surprise, nor by suddenness, but with a certain
   measure of deliberation, and with enough of resistance to shew that
   nothing can be pleaded in excuse: all these, and a multitude more of
   particulars, which it is impossible to touch on in detail, make people
   often feel that, undoubted as is the perfect and exhaustless mercy of
   Christ, yet in their particular case there are features which shut them
   out from the consolation they would readily minister to others.

   Now I am not going to argue against this feelings, so far as it
   promotes in us bitterness of repentance, fear, humiliation, and prayer
   for pardon. It is to be corrected only when it clashes with the perfect
   revelation of our Lord's character, and of His dealings with us. Too
   much humbled we cannot be, too tender of conscience, too fearful to
   offend; but we may dishonour Him by unworthy and faithless mistrusts,
   by thinking that He is verily such an one as ourselves, and that His
   forgiveness is no readier and broader than the perception we form of it
   in our hearts. If there be any one thing of vital force in a life of
   Christian obedience, it is a true and full knowledge of Him whom we
   obey. His character is our very law; it imposes on us the conditions of
   our whole life, in thought, word, and deed, and defines the whole of
   our relations to Him. Now these words of His in the text reveal to us
   that to those who repent, howsoever often they may have sinned, there
   is perpetual forgiveness; that as often as we turn to Him, saying in
   truth, "I repent," He will take us back again. And this is, indeed, the
   very grace and mystery of the Gospel. Let us consider it a little more
   fully.

   1. The state of man by creation was this: God made him sinless; he
   sinned, and died,--one sin, and all was lost. The work of creation had
   in it no remedial provision; it was a state of sanctity for a sinless
   creature; it contemplated no fall, no imperfection, no infirmity. Once
   fallen, all was marred; the relation of God and man once broken, the
   power of restoration must be sought in a new order and law of grace.
   The state of creation, then, was awful and severe in its perfection,
   and in itself had no remedy or healing for sin. Adam fell, lost his
   gift of righteousness, and passed under the power of death. He begat a
   son in his own likeness, and handed on the dark inheritance of the
   fall; the tide had set away from God, and every generation swelled the
   stream and made it run more fiercely. The first Adam was shorn of all
   his powers, and there was no help in him. The fall and sorrow were the
   heirloom of his children.

   2. Now it is exactly in this point that the Gospel, or the new
   creation, of which Christ our Lord, the second Adam, is the head and
   root, differs from the first. It is a mystery of restoration; it has in
   it an inexhaustible source of healing for the sin of the world. By one
   act of disobedience the first creation passed away for ever. The second
   is the perpetual remedy of sin. And this is the meaning of St. Paul's
   words: "As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and
   so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. . . . Death
   reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after
   the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of Him that
   was to come. But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if
   through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God,
   and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded
   unto many. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for
   the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many
   offences unto justification. For if by one man's offence death reigned
   by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift
   of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ." [191] In
   the first creation repentance had no place; in the second, repentance
   is the first idea and law; it is a dispensation given to penitents.
   That is to say, Christ has made atonement for sin; He has taken away
   the sin of the world. By His obedience, and by His death, He has
   cancelled, in the unseen world, the sentence which is to us as
   inscrutable as the existence and origin of evil, to which mystery it is
   related. In this sense, then, the Gospel is emphatically a remedial
   dispensation; and for this end the Incarnation and atonement of the Son
   of God was accomplished. And farther: by its very first law it
   contemplates in us imperfection, frailty, and evil. It is a power to
   heal, and its mission is to the sick. That which could not so much as
   enter into the scope of the covenant of creation, fills the whole field
   of intention, so to speak, under the Gospel. It has to do with
   creatures both infirm and infected with sin; and for their raising,
   cleansing, and recovery, the whole ministration of the Spirit by
   mysteries and sacraments is shed abroad. And still more: even in those
   who are made partakers of these gifts of peace and grace--that is, in
   the regenerate--there yet remains the infection of original sin. To the
   end of life, though never so much subdued, it lingers still. The most
   perfect saint is not sinless; this, since creation, has been the
   prerogative of One alone. It will be the inheritance of saints in
   bliss; but on earth, so long as they are in the flesh, there is in them
   the mystery of the fall. In some it is the spur to watchings, fastings,
   mortifications, prayers; it keeps them in perpetual watchfulness. God
   wonderfully keeping them, their foot steps never slide. These are they
   of whom St. John says, "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin;
   for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of
   God." And again: "He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that
   wicked one toucheth him not." [192] There is, doubt less, a state in
   which the fallen nature, though still in us, does not shape itself into
   sin--a high and rare endowment, the earthly crown of those who walk
   with God in a perfect way. In others (and they are the greater number,
   even among such as may be counted holy), the sin of our nature still
   abides, in the form of ignorance, obliquity, passion, frailty, and the
   like. Though these things be not imputed to them to their condemnation;
   though they do not so far prevail as to break their bond of peace with
   their unseen Lord; yet they are imperfections which the law of the
   first creation would not endure; they could find no sufferance but in a
   dispensation of healing, and under a law of restoration. The obedience
   of imperfect saints, though it could in nowise bear the severity of
   God's judgment, yet is pleasing in His sight for Christ's sake; and
   their imperfections are not laid to their charge as sins. The
   Incarnation of the Word made flesh has laid the beginnings of a new
   creation, in which, until they be made perfect, the imperfect obedience
   and imperfect nature of His servants is accepted as well-pleasing in
   the sight of God. Not that the Gospel is a relaxation of the Law, or a
   sort of easy compromise, by which, for Christ's sake, a lower standard
   of obedience is accepted in full, as if it were perfect. Far from it.
   As the light of truth has from the beginning waxed stronger and
   stronger in the world, shining more and more, through the ages of
   patriarchs and prophets, unto the perfect day, so did both the law of
   righteousness and the gifts of grace expand and grow upward to the law
   of Christ's example and the gift of regeneration. As a law of
   obedience, the Gospel is higher, deeper, holier, and more peremptory,
   in proportion as the grace of the Gospel is mightier and more abundant.
   It is not of types and shadows that St, John speaks, when he says, "the
   darkness is past, and the true light now shineth;" but of the gift of
   righteousness, and of the law of love. Except the righteousness of a
   Christian exceed the righteousness of Gentile and of Jew, it will go
   hard with him in the day of judgment. "To whom much is given, of him
   shall much be required." The grace of regeneration and of the holy
   eucharist has not been given to Christians that they should live less
   humbly in obedience and fear than the Jews. As they have greater gifts,
   blessings, and endowments, so have they higher laws, more searching
   precepts, more perfect counsels of devotion. Thus much is said by the
   way, lest in what has been expressed, any thing should seem by the
   farthest consequence to detract from the sanctity of the Gospel as a
   law of life. As a law of obedience, it is a transcript of Christ's
   perfection; but as a ministry of grace, it is full of healing and of
   divine compassion. It is a dispensation of forgiveness; and the very
   spirit and life of it is in this precept of our Master: "I say not unto
   thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."

   Let us now take some particular cases to which this truth is directly
   applicable.

   1. And, first, of those who fall into sin after baptism. In one sense
   this all men do; even those I have spoken of before, in whom the
   virtual presence of sin seems to us never to become actual; even they
   have all sinned. But I am not speaking of these, nor, indeed, of any
   whose life has been such as to keep unbroken the relation of peace and
   forgiveness between them and their Lord. We have now to deal with the
   case of those who after baptism fall into sins which forfeit the favour
   and countenance of God. In dealing with these persons there have been
   two extremes: one is that of the Novatian heretics of old, who denied
   that there was to such any place for repentance; the other in these
   days, of those who treat sin after baptism as lightly as sin before it.
   Both these errors are a dishonour to our blessed Master: the one to His
   compassion, the other to His sanctity. It cannot, for a moment, be
   denied, that sin done in spite of the grace of baptism, and of the
   light of the Spirit, is far guiltier than the sins of any unbaptised
   man can be. We cannot say what wound it may inflict upon the soul, what
   it may forfeit in the kingdom of life, into how great peril it may
   bring us of the second death. Nevertheless, we were baptized into a
   state of repentance; we were thereby made partakers of the healing and
   perpetual restoration of the Gospel; we were put into a living relation
   to the Redeemer, in which there is the law and the grace of repentance
   for all sinners. We were regenerated, that we might be penitents; not,
   indeed, that we should lay up new matter for repentance--there is no
   need of that, God knoweth; but that we should repent all our days of
   the fallen nature which by our birth-sin is within us. And this
   regeneration contains in it also the grace of repentance for those who
   fall again, and after their fall turn to Him for pardon. The grace of
   baptism, which should have been unto holiness, if resisted and baffled,
   may still become the grace of repentance. It is the plank of escape
   after shipwreck, perilous but sufficient, if clung to with a fast hold
   and a steady heart. So far, then, is sin after baptism from being
   excluded from forgiveness, that it is baptism that lays the foundation
   both of grace and promise to the repenting Christian.

   2. Again: there is a darker case than that of those who have sinned
   after baptism: I mean, of those who have sinned after repentance. So
   deep and lasting is the hurt done to the spiritual nature of man by
   sin, that even after it is repented of, it still soils and weakens his
   heart; and for this reason so many who have become penitent of their
   past sins are again drawn into relapses. The same out ward
   solicitations, after a while, address themselves with subtil
   allurements and sudden returns to the same surviving passions; and
   there are few penitents who have not been more than once retaken in the
   same snares, after they have begun to break them. There is no need to
   say that this is a dangerous condition. Such a man grieves not only the
   Spirit of regeneration, but the Spirit of repentance; he lessens the
   force and power of warnings and convictions, fears and hopes, upon his
   conscience and heart. So much of the discipline of salvation has been
   tried upon him in vain; his after-backsliding seems to betray the
   falsehood of his seeming repentance.

   3. And once more: there is a still more fearful case even than these,
   namely, that of a Christian who sins after a course and habit of
   religion. We deceive ourselves by thinking that none turn aside into
   after-sins but those whose profession of repentance and of religion has
   been insincere. It is most certain, however, that people of a sincere
   but shallow or secure habit of mind do fall by the strength and
   suddenness of temptation, and by their own want of watchfulness and
   mortification of heart. Sins which they would never believe themselves
   capable of committing, they sometimes wake up and find that they have
   indeed committed. For all such men Satan lays cunning snares: he knows
   what baits have most allurement for them; and he dresses up his
   temptations with his own stolen light, making them seem all fair and
   akin to God's service. He knows how to open pitfalls in all lawful and
   in all holy places--in our homes, in our chambers, in church, at the
   very altar; and many whose religion is sincere but frail, fall heavily,
   and with high provocation of the Divine longsuffering. In such men, so
   enlightened, so familiar with holy things, so aware of temptation, evil
   thoughts, unhallowed motions, dishonest casuistry, cheatings of
   conscience, evasions of light, deafness to warning, wilfulness,
   trifling with the preliminaries of temptation, and the like, have
   intenser spiritual evil than the ruder and broader disobedience of less
   practised and instructed minus. There is something very awful in the
   reiterated commission of any sin long known, professedly repented of,
   and habitually prayed against. If sin after baptism, or sin after
   repentance, be a provocation, what is sin against the light of many
   years and the realities of a mature probation? In such persons, year by
   year sin becomes more exceeding sinful; though their greater sins be
   forsaken, yet the less become more guilty; though they be less
   frequent, yet each one outweighs a multitude of sins done in the days
   of weakness and of twilight.

   Still even for all these there is mercy. There is unspeakable
   consolation for them in the words, "not until seven times, but until
   seventy times seven;" "if he trespass against thee seven times in a
   day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent;
   thou shalt forgive him." What else remains to us but this alone? and
   what does this teach us, but that no provocations, no reiteration of
   disobedience, how often soever committed, even between the sunrise and
   the sunset, shall shut out the true penitent from pardon? This is the
   one and only condition: "if he turn to thee, saying, I repent." There
   is no limitation in the covenant of God, no tale of sins fixed by
   number, no measure of duration or of frequency registered in heaven. If
   only the sinner repent--this is the one and only necessary condition;
   the longsuffering and compassion of the Son of God are inexhaustible.
   If any sinner be lost, he will be lost through his own impenitence.

   Let us, then, fear to lose time in turning to Him. Delay hardens men's
   hearts. "Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and so ye perish from the
   right way, if His wrath be kindled, yea, but a little." [193] Let us,
   when through our great frailty we sin against Him, go to Him
   straightway, and cast ourselves at His feet, and put our mouth in the
   dust; let us confess all we have done, with all its aggravations,
   leaving nothing for the accuser to add against us. Morning and night
   let us lay ourselves open before our forgiving and pitiful Lord. When
   we have fallen into any definite and particular sin, let us record on
   our knees before Him our solemn resolution to avoid, with all
   watchfulness, all the preambles and invitations by which we have been
   betrayed to it. Let us lay the rod upon ourselves, praying Him to
   spare, us. Let us ask of Him not forgiveness alone, but bitterness and
   brokenness of heart, perpetual compunction, shame at our ingratitude,
   trembling and awe at our rashness in sinning against Him, the
   brightness of whose Presence would smite our whole being into dust and
   ashes. Blessed truth, that with Him is forgiveness seven times a day!
   for seven times a day do we commit greater sins than lost the paradise
   of God. "How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean
   that is born of a woman? Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not;
   yea, the stars are not pure in His sight. How much less man, that is a
   worm? and the son of man, which is a worm?" [194]

SERMON XX.

  THE GENTLENESS OF CHRIST.

    ISAIAH xliii. 3.

   "A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not
   quench."

   IN this prophecy Isaiah foretells the gentleness of Christ. St. Matthew
   quotes it when he is recording the longsuffering of our Lord with the
   Pharisees. He had healed the man with the withered hand on the Sabbath
   day: the Pharisees lay in wait to entangle Him by questions; and when
   He had baffled them, they "went out, and held a council against Him,
   that they might destroy Him. But when Jesus knew it, He withdrew
   Himself from thence: and great multitudes followed Him, and He healed
   them all; and charged them that they should not make Him known." This
   He enjoined, it seems, lest the Pharisees should be goaded and
   provoked, by the unwelcome proofs of His divine power, into precipitate
   acts against Him. For their sakes He would have concealed Himself;
   lest, by contending with Him, they should destroy themselves. His whole
   ministry was full of the like gentle and tender forbearance, "That it
   might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,
   Behold My Servant, whom I have chosen; My Beloved, in whom My soul is
   well pleased: I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He shall shew judgment
   to the Gentiles. He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man
   hear His voice in the streets." His ministry was not a public
   disputation, with clamour and popular applause, with factions in the
   city, and a following of people. It was silent and penetrating, "as the
   light that goeth forth;" [195] spreading every where with resistless
   power, and yet from a source often with drawn from sight. "A bruised
   reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench;" [196]
   which seems to say, so light and soft shall be His touch, that the reed
   which is nearly asunder shall not be broken down, and the flax which
   has only not left off to smoke shall not be put out. A most beautiful
   parable of tenderness, of which Moses, the meekest of men, was a type,
   when he said in the Spirit: "My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my
   speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb,
   and as the showers upon the grass:" [197] and of which the Psalmist
   prophesied when he said, "He shall come down like the rain upon the
   mown grass: as showers that water the earth. In His days shall the
   righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon
   endureth." [198] The same was foretold by Isaiah: "Behold, a king shall
   reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. And a man
   shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the
   tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great
   rock in a weary land." [199] It was in His gentleness, His tender
   compassion, His longsuffering and patient endurance of sinners, that
   these prophecies were fulfilled.

   Let us first take such examples as are recorded in holy Scripture; and
   then draw, from this view of our blessed Lord's character, the
   instruction which is implied in His perfect gentleness to sinners.

   We see it, then, in all His dealing with His disciples. Wheresoever
   there were the first faint stirrings of faith or love, He cherished and
   sheltered them with tender care. In His teaching He led them on little
   by little, line upon line, drawing them first to familiar converse with
   Himself; not upbraiding their slowness; not severely rebuking their
   faults. When James and John would have brought fire from heaven, He
   said only, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of." [200] To
   Philip, when he blindly asked to see the Father, "Have I been so long
   time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip?" [201] And when
   He detected their ambitious contests which should be the greatest,
   "being in the house He asked them, What was it that ye disputed among
   yourselves by the way?" [202] Even at the last supper He said, "I have
   many things to say unto you, but ye can not bear them now:" and to St.
   Thomas, after his vehement unbelief, "Reach hither thy finger, and
   behold My hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into My side:
   and be not faithless, but believing." [203] And to St. Peter, in
   chastisement for his three open denials, He said thrice, as in a
   doubting, melancholy tenderness, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me?"
   [204]

   And so in like manner to all the people. It was to the whole multitude
   He said: "Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am
   meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For My
   yoke is easy, and My burden is light." [205] He permitted so near an
   access to all men, that it was turned to His reproach. He was "a friend
   of publicans and sinners." "This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with
   them." Again, we read: "One of the Pharisees desired Him that He would
   eat with him. And He went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to
   meat. And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she
   knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an
   alabaster box of ointment, and stood at His feet behind Him weeping,
   and began to wash His feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs
   of her head, and kissed His feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
   Now when the Pharisee which had bidden Him saw it, he spake within
   himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who
   and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a
   sinner. And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to
   say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. There was a certain
   creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and
   the other fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave
   them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? Simon
   answered and said, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And He
   said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. And He turned to the woman,
   and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house,
   thou gavest Me no water for My feet: but she hath washed My feet with
   tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest Me no
   kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss
   My feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath
   anointed My feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins,
   which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is
   forgiven, the same loveth little. And He said unto her, Thy sins are
   forgiven." [206] And once more: "The Scribes and Pharisees brought unto
   Him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
   they say unto Him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the
   very act. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be
   stoned: but what sayest Thou? This they said, tempting Him, that they
   might have to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down, and with His finger
   wrote on the ground, as though He heard them not. So when they
   continued asking Him, He lifted up Himself, and said unto them, He that
   is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. And again
   He stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they which heard it,
   being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning
   at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the
   woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up Himself, and saw
   none but the woman, He said unto her, Woman, where are those thine
   accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus
   said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more." [207]

   Now it is obvious that the source of this perfect tenderness to sinners
   is none other than the Divine compassion. It was the love and pity of
   the Word made flesh. It teaches us, however, some great truths, full of
   instruction, which we will now consider.

   1. First, it is plain that this gentle reception, even of the greatest
   sinners, implies that where there is so much as a spark of life in the
   conscience, there is possibility of an entire conversion to God. Where
   there is room to hope any thing, there is room to hope all things. The
   greatest of sinners may become, we dare not say how great a saint. Such
   is the nature of sin, and of the human soul, and of all its energies
   and actings; such, also, the virtue of the blood of Christ; and such
   the power of the Holy Ghost, that be the sinner what he may, he may be
   purged and made white with the purification of the saints. I am
   speaking not of what is easy, or common, but of what is possible, and,
   by true conversion to God, pledged and sure: neither am I saying that
   there shall not be some difference between what such converted sinners
   will be, compared with what they might have been; but this is certain,
   that "though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
   though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." [208] Such is
   the mysterious nature of the human spirit, of its affections and will,
   such its energies and intensity, that it may, at any time, be so
   renewed by the Spirit of the new creation, as to expel, with the most
   perfect rejection, all the powers, qualities, visions, and thoughts of
   evil. We know so little of spiritual natures, that we are compelled to
   use metaphors; and often our illustrations become our snares, and we
   turn them into arguments, and reason from visible things to the
   inscrutable conditions of our spiritual being. For instance, we speak
   of the stains of sin, the soils of lust, the scars and wounds made by
   transgression in the soul: and it is true that what stains, soils,
   scars, wounds, are to the body, such are lusts, in deed, desire, and
   thought, to the soul. But we cannot therefore say that the spiritual
   nature is not susceptible of a healing and purgation which is
   absolutely perfect, to which the cleansing or health of the body is no
   true analogy. For instance, the very life of sin is the will. By sin it
   is a corrupt and unclean will; by conversion it becomes cleansed and
   pure. So long as it is here subjected to the action of the flesh, it is
   imperfect; but when disembodied, what shall hinder its being as pure as
   if it had never sinned? What is the substance of the will? What is sin?
   And in what does sin inhere but in the inclination of the will? When
   this is restored to perfect holiness, what effect of the fall will
   remain? We are greatly ignorant of all these things; but it is evident
   that, be we what we may, if our repentance and conversion be true,
   there is no height of sanctification, no approximation to the Divine
   Image, that we may not make in this world, and in the world to come be
   made sinless in the kingdom of God. And if our spiritual nature may be
   made sinless in the life to come, how can we limit its purification in
   this world? How can we say that it may not be brought out from the
   effects of any sin, or habit of sinning, as intensely and energetically
   pure as if it had never been bribed and corrupted by evil; and,
   moreover, sharpened with a peculiar abhorrence of the defilement from
   which it has been delivered? Such is the mysterious complexion of a
   spiritual nature, that it may, in a moment, and by an act of volition,
   virtually and truly anticipate an habitual condition of the soul; as,
   for instance, in a true death-bed repentance there is contained a life
   of penance and purity, though it be never here developed into act. And
   this may throw light on many questions; such as the condition of the
   heathen, and of those that are born in separation from the unity of the
   Church, and on the state of those who, after baptism, by falling into
   sin, have resisted the grace of regeneration. Of these last, it would
   appear that their condition is changed for the worse, in the point of
   having sinned with greater guilt, and done despite to that which should
   have been their salvation. By consent to sin, they have made the work
   of repentance more difficult and doubtful. The blood of Christ, and the
   grace of the Holy Ghost, have yet the power of a perfect healing and
   purification; but repentance, which, on their side, is the condition,
   it is harder to fulfil. Still, wheresoever there are the lingering
   remains of grace, or the least beginnings of contrition, there is hope
   of a perfect repentance, and of a perfect sanctity. It seems, then,
   that it was for this reason that our blessed Lord, the sinless One,
   suffered publicans, sinners, and harlots, and even the adulteress, to
   draw near to Him; because in them, under the foul gatherings of sin,
   which spread like a crust of leprosy upon them, and in the darkness and
   death of their inmost soul, He could see the faint strength of a living
   pulse, the dim spark of sorrow, fear, remorse, and desire to be
   redeemed from the bondage of the devil, and therefore the
   susceptibility of perfect holiness, the unextinguished capacity of an
   inheritance with the saints in light.

   2. Another great truth implied in our Lord's conduct to sinners is,
   that the only sure way of fostering the beginnings of repentance is to
   receive them with gentleness and compassion. This is a truth which is
   in the mouth of more than rightly understand it. Our Lord appears to
   have dealt with those who came to Him in two ways. Some He received, as
   we have already seen, with a Divine love and pity, and some with a
   piercing severity. But these last were those only of whom, it seems,
   there was hope no longer. The reed was already broken, and the flax was
   quenched. "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut
   up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves,
   neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you,
   Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows houses, and for
   a pretence make long prayers: therefore ye shall receive the greater
   damnation. Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
   compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye
   make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves!" [209] These
   were they that had "rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not
   being baptized" [210] by John unto repentance. Jesus said unto them:
   "Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the
   kingdom of God before you. For John came unto you in the way of
   righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and harlots
   believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that
   ye might believe him." [211]

   Now, that which made our Lord so change His voice was the inward state
   of those to whom He spoke. He saw their falsehood, guile, and
   hollowness; that they were white without, but all unclean within. Their
   whole spiritual being was estranged from Him, and set in array against
   His truth and holiness: they were beyond the attractions of pity, and
   the power of compassion. Towards these His perfect sanctity breathed a
   holy indignation. To be gentle was to betray the work of God, and to
   add boldness to their impiety. He met them as He will meet them once
   more, in the day of judgment: but at the time He spoke, even His
   denunciations were mercies; warnings of a doom still delayed; offers of
   pardon to those who would be converted, that He might heal them.

   But on those in whom there is the faintest stirring of repentance, the
   love of Christ falls with a soft but penetrating force. For there are
   in us, as it were, two minds, with two arrays of feelings, which are
   awakened and excited into act just as the tone and bearing of those who
   admonish us vary in their character. Impatience, irritation,
   self-defence, unfairness, resentment, self-approval, wilfulness, are so
   marshalled together, that they move all at once, and oppose themselves
   in one array and front against a harsh voice and a severe hand. And all
   these are the direct stimulants of pride and hardness; the most fatal
   hindrances to confession and repentance. To receive sinners coldly, or
   with an averted eye, an estranged heart, and a hasty unsparing tongue,
   will seldom fail to drive them into defiance or self-abandonment. A
   sinner that is out of hope is lost. Hope is the last thing left. If
   this be crushed, the flax is extinct. Through rough usage sinners fall
   into despair, and through despair into reckless contradiction of God's
   will, and thence into deliberate sinning, into taking pleasure in evil
   deeds, and, lastly, into "glorying in their shame." From this there
   seems no rising again: it is the nearest approach to the state of
   fallen angels. Such are the effects of a merciless severity; whether it
   arise from harshness in the reprover, or from a rigid tone of morals,
   and a mistaken jealousy for the glory of God. I have said that many,
   who little understand what they are saying, are wont to speak boldly of
   the tenderness wherewith sinners should he welcomed to repentance: and
   they shew their misunderstanding in this; they confound the pure
   severity of compassion with personal harshness of temper. Nothing can
   be more dangerous and repulsive than a harsh spirit. Truth told without
   love is perilous in the measure in which it is true. The promises of
   God, held out without tenderness, are so offered as to turn sinners
   away from mercy. But if any thing can be more dangerous than this, it
   is the presumptuous way in which men give largess of God's mercy, and
   encourage sinners to believe themselves to be forgiven before they are
   penitents, or to be penitents before they have more than entered on the
   threshold of repentance. What can be more unreal and misleading than to
   press on men the belief that they are forgiven, when their whole soul
   cries aloud that they have not repented; or to persuade them that their
   sins are blotted out, if only they can bring themselves to believe so?
   as if self-persuasion, without contrition of heart, were a full
   remission of sins. What antinomianism, what superstitious reliance on
   forms and rites, what blind seeking to charms and divinations, can be
   farther than this from the forgiveness of the Gospel? Our blessed Lord,
   who was so tender and merciful, did not so slightly heal the wounds of
   those who came to Him. With ineffable compassion He spoke words of fear
   and warning. It was His very tenderness that gave them such a
   penetrating sharpness. "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
   perish." "Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye can
   not enter into the kingdom of heaven." "Strive to enter in at the
   strait gate; for many shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able."
   "Many are called, but few are chosen." "He that endureth unto the end
   shall be saved." "No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking
   back, is fit for the kingdom of heaven." "He that taketh not his cross,
   and followeth after Me, is not worthy of Me." As also the parables of
   the last judgment, and of the unprofitable servant, the
   wedding-garment, the barren fig-tree, and the like; what do they teach
   us, but that conversion, and a life of repentance, and the reaching of
   life eternal, are awful and arduous realities, full of danger and
   anxious fear? His tenderness was not to dispel the fears of penitents,
   but to change them into a holy and saving fear; to teach them to be
   afraid, not of Him, but of themselves; to trust in His tenderness as
   thoroughly as they mistrusted their own hearts. One great hindrance in
   the way of true conversion is an imperfect knowledge of His Divine
   character, and a mistrust of His infinite compassion. His tenderness is
   a thing so far above the thoughts even of saints, that it is no wonder
   that sinners, fallen and soiled with evil, should not be able to
   believe it. The mysteries of faith are not more above the understanding
   of men to comprehend, than the gentleness of Christ is beyond their
   hearts to conceive. That One so pure, so keen in His holy will, so
   grievously provoked by habitual disobedience, should endure the
   approach of sinners, is contrary to every natural suggestion of their
   minds. They fear to come within the range of those eyes that are "as a
   flame of fire." Their own consciousness of inward sinfulness makes them
   turn even from repentance. There is in every sinner a great burden of
   misery, soreness, and alarm; but even these, instead of driving him to
   confession, make him shut himself up in a fevered and brooding fear.
   And it was in this peculiar wretchedness of sin that the gentleness of
   our Lord gave to the sinners who approached Him both solace and hope.
   They felt that, shrink as they must from priest and scribe, Pharisee
   and Sadducee, ay, and from all human eyes and human hearts, there was
   in Him something that no one else possessed, a softness of eye, and a
   gentleness of speech, a meekness of bearing, and a compassion in His
   touch, which drew them away from all men, and out of their very selves,
   to cast their whole being upon Him. It was a strange courage which came
   upon them; a boldness, full of trembling, yet an awe without alarm.
   What little motions of good were in them, what little stirrings of
   conscience, what faint remainder of better resolutions, what feeble
   gleams of all but extinguished light--all seemed to revive, and to turn
   in sympathy towards some source of kindred nature, and to stretch
   itself out in hope to some what long desired, with a dim unconscious
   love. It was an affinity of the spirit, working in penitents, with the
   spirit of Christ, that made them draw to Him. In Him they felt that
   their worst fears were quelled. They were not afraid to confess their
   unworthiness. They felt Him to be pitiful, and that He would bear long
   with them, and not cast them out, or upbraid them for their soiled and
   miserable state; and this opened a new future to them. It seemed to
   break through a prison-wall; to make a breach in the thraldom of their
   daily round of sins, in the oppressive consciousness of guilt. They
   seemed to see before them a promise of peace, and a hope that one day
   they should be set free from the bondage of themselves. The mere
   transitory thought that forgiveness is yet possible, that the favour of
   God is not for ever gone, that they may even, now one day enter into
   bliss all this makes the heart of the weakest to be strong, and of the
   hardest to melt away. And what is the very life of this hope but the
   tenderness of Christ, the unwearied patience, the long suffering, and
   gentle pity of our Redeemer? Therefore, it was not only because of His
   infinite compassion as God, that He so dealt with sinners; but because,
   knowing the nature of man, its strange depths and windings, its
   weakness and fears, He knew that this was the surest way of winning
   them to Himself.

   And to come to ourselves in particular: we have, each one of us, made
   trial of this same gracious and tender compassion. As, for instance, in
   the many years between our baptism and our repentance; for how few they
   are who, after baptism, have not so fallen as to need a particular and
   deep repentance! For how many years the grace of our regeneration lay
   in us oppressed, and to all outward eyes extinguished! What multitudes
   of early faults, premature sins, even in childhood, have most of us
   committed; and how soon did the whole range of evil open itself upon
   us; and how consentingly did we enter upon it--first in its outskirts
   and, perhaps, with fear; and in a little while with an habitual
   self-possession, until we became worldly, selfish, and fearless! What
   but His patience would have borne with us? What but His gentleness
   would have cherished our few better dispositions and holier thoughts,
   and fostered them into the convictions of repentance? Perhaps there was
   nothing of God in us but a few texts of Holy Scripture, a dread of the
   lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, and a few prayers, said with
   unclean lips in the very midst of actual sins: and that even this
   should have been fostered by Him into the grace of illumination, of
   holy fear, and of devout prayer; that the small and all but stifled
   motions of spiritual life should be now unfolded into the reign of
   Christ's kingdom in our hearts,--is a strange and surpassing mercy, a
   very miracle of patience. And again, even after bringing us to
   repentance, what provocations have we offered to His long-suffering!
   How shallow and vapid has our contrition been; at least, for how long a
   time was it little better than a sullen fear or a selfish remorse! And
   by what breaches of better resolutions, by what reservations of
   indulged faults, by what retractings of our expressed intentions, has
   our repentance been retarded! For how long a time were we two distinct
   characters, as distinct as if we had a twofold personality! In secret
   how full of confessions and protestations of abasement; and yet in the
   sight of the world how buoyant and self-trusting! How long did we keep
   back some sins still unconfessed; how full of wiles were we in
   extenuating them, even on our knees; how often we went back to them
   again; and with how little indignation at our relapses! Nevertheless He
   bore with all. He gave us time, and the pleadings of His Spirit, and
   wakened us up to see our shame, because He saw that the reed was not
   altogether broken.

   And, once more: even in those whose repentance is far advanced there is
   much to call for His forbearance and compassion; as, for instance, in
   the slow formation of their religious character. Even in those who live
   a religious life, what imperfections still remain, what a mixture of
   motives and purposes, what littleness and inconsistency, what fear of
   man, what worship of the world! How few can, even after their
   conversion to God, resist impressions from without, as from the maxims,
   examples, rules, tone of society! How few are stedfast against the
   swaying to and fro of public opinion, and are able to keep themselves
   from the fluctuations by which the face of the Church is disturbed! And
   well were it if only these greater things moved us: most men are at the
   mercy of much less active and powerful causes. For the remainders of
   old tempers, such as pride, anger, self-will, are still within them,
   and make them susceptible of manifold temptations. They acquiesce in a
   low standard of devotion, and weaken themselves by yielding to the
   weaker practice of others; and all this produces a wavering ambiguous
   life, which is neither worldly nor devout, having the beginning of
   better things, but in a hindered and obstructed state. Such people
   often settle down into a languid and lukewarm habit, which must be a
   slight of peculiar point and emphasis to Him who, for their redemption,
   died in agony. The tardy, wavering, inconstant, and often retrograde
   movement of our religious life must be highly displeasing in His sight.
   And that we are spared and still aided by His grace, by His truth and
   Spirit, and by His special providence, is a signal proof of His
   changeless compassion, and patient endurance even of sinful
   infirmities. Only let us compare ourselves with His dealings towards
   us. Let us see what we are by the side of what we might have been, if
   the grace of our baptism, and the lessons of our childhood, the
   humiliation and discipline of our repentance, had taken its full
   effect, and had wrought their perfect work. Let us compare what we do
   with what we know, what we know with what He has taught us, what we
   pray for with what we really desire. How laggard and half-hearted is
   our religion at its best estate! How full of dark spots and deep
   hollows is the brightest and fairest character! How much do we provoke
   and try His pity; ever going back, swerving aside, doing great things
   weakly, and high things feebly, and holy things coldly! "If Thou, Lord,
   shouldst be extreme to mark what is done amiss, O Lord, who should
   abide it? But there is mercy with Thee, therefore shalt Thou be
   feared."

   And one more example we may take, in His dealing with those that are
   tried by affliction, by loss of those they love, or by sickness,
   anxieties, disappointments. All these things are in His hand; and He
   lays them on, not all at once, but little by little, to prepare us for
   greater trials. We never have more than we can bear. The present hour
   we are always able to endure. As our day, so is our strength. If the
   trials of many years were gathered into one, they would over whelm us;
   therefore, in pity to our little strength, He sends first one, then
   another, then removes both, and lays on a third, heavier, perhaps, than
   either; but all is so wisely measured to our strength, that the bruised
   reed is never broken. We do not enough look at our trials in this
   continuous and successive view. Each one is sent to teach us something,
   and altogether they have a lesson which is beyond the power of any to
   teach alone. But if they came together, we should break down, and learn
   nothing. The smoking flax would be put out; and we should be crushed
   "into the dust of death."

   And now to conclude: how great a consolation there is in this Divine
   tenderness of our Lord! How it bids good cheer to those who have at
   last begun to amend their lives, but are sorely burdened, and at times
   tempted to give up for lost! Be your beginning never so late, yet if it
   be true, all shall one day be well. It is a word of cheer to us all.
   Alas for us, if He were soon wearied out as we are, soon provoked,
   ready to upbraid, sharp in the strokes of His hand; where should we
   have been long ago? What in His sight is the whole Church under heaven,
   but a bruised reed, and weak; a smoking flax, smouldering, struggling,
   ready to expire? Even in its best estate, in its first love, in the
   fervour of its first conversion, it is little more. And what is it now?
   The age of prophets, apostles, martyrs, is past; and for the saints,
   they seem few and hidden. The Church is bruised by schisms; her
   strength bowed down from its ancient stateliness, to droop along upon
   the earth; her lights are scattered and dim; here and there they shine
   out feebly and alone, as if to say that the flax is not wholly
   quenched. Where is now the strength and fervour of other days? Where
   are the penitents, and the mourners, and the prostrate? Where are the
   companies of those who chastened themselves with fasting, and were
   strong in spirit, following in the path of the Cross? Where are they
   that forsook home, and all that they had, to live as strangers, for the
   love of the heavenly country? Where are now the pure, and the meek, the
   holy and humble men of heart, the devoted, and the gifted? Surely the
   days are already come, when, because iniquity abounds, the love of many
   hath waxed cold; and truth is perishing, in preparation for that day of
   which the Lord asked, "When the Son of Man cometh, shall He find faith
   on the earth?"
